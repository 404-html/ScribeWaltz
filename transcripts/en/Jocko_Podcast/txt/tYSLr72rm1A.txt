Speaker 1:          00:00:01       This is Jocko podcast number 92 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. The concept of finding an IED is relatively simple. It is essentially identifying what doesn't belong in the natural area in front of you before one proceeds. However, one must ensure that all of the marines with them or at a safe distance such that if the searcher unintentionally detonate an IED during his investigation, the marines he is with will not be harmed. The first step is to take a good look at where you are and where are you planning to go identify anything that looks out of the ordinary. With respect to nature, the world naturally doesn't often have patterns or perfect shapes. Essentially you are looking for areas where you suspect man has been in contact with nature. When one patrols in the same area, frequently one can establish a baseline observation for what to look for and what the area looks like normally. Thus on subsequent visits, it is possible to identify elements that are out of place. The next step is to investigate the route that you have chosen through this danger area. The three main tools used for this investigation are the eyeballs, a metal detector and to cutting edge digging device called the human hand

Speaker 1:          00:01:48       proceeding slowly in a forward direction. One swings the metal detector in a fashion that covers every square inch of the chosen route. In order to do this, start with a metal detector to one side of the route.

Speaker 2:          00:02:03       Okay

Speaker 1:          00:02:04       and move it straight across to the other side, keeping the search head an inch or two above and parallel to the ground. Once it is a cross, move the detector forward half the length of the search head and swing it in the opposite direction to the original side of the route. This is a process that continues for the entirety of your time moving through the danger area. At some point during your movement along this route, you will want to investigate certain spots that you think may contain an IED. You can be alerted to these spots in multiple ways from your early assessment before proceeding through the area, newly acquired suspicions as you move through the area and also from sounds that your metal detector makes the process of swinging the metal detector back and forth and inching forward is time consuming. The best of the best are the ones that can optimize safety and keep time spent to a minimum. It is always better. However, to err on the side of caution, except in the most extreme of emergencies, the investigation of a suspicious area must proceed with extreme caution. You start by kneeling down,

Speaker 1:          00:03:34       being sure to be well balanced and stable. You must ensure that no gear is going to accidentally fall off or slip out and touch the ground. You reach out with your fingers and with the gentleness of a butterfly landing on a daisy, move the dirt in front of the front edge of the metal hit. Proceed forward a nanometer at a time in this fashion, uncovering more dirt over a wider space until you either find the metal that set off the detector or you are satisfied that there is no danger from this particular metal hit. If metal is found, the area must be rechecked to ensure that the metal was found was not a decoy. One may think that the tension during this time is akin to being Tom cruise dangling inches above a motion sensor floor, but the necessity of having a clear mind and the amount of practice that has gone into this exact process makes it seem second nature and ordinary. After you are satisfied that you have cleared this suspicious area, proceed forward as you move forward. You are also proofing the lane. That thing proofing the lane or confirming that is free from IED is usually done with a special mechanical device

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       but it is now being done with your feet and don't forget as you go forward to lay down markers for everyone else who comes behind you to follow. This is the way that I handled the situation I was now in. I inched forward with my metal detector. I didn't see anything special about the area. My metal detector was making noises, but nothing large enough that I thought at warranty did an investigation. The marines in our patrol watched and waited. As I cleared and proofed the lane, then it all went black.

Speaker 2:          00:06:10       No,

Speaker 1:          00:06:12       that description is about as good as I have read about the act of searching for IED. Yes. I actually never searched for IED in that type of method. And of course in Ramadi everyone was always searching Fridays you, you were always looking, you inspecting. We were suspicious of every pile of rubble, every piece of junk on the road, every off colored piece of dirt or pavement or concrete or sand. But we were in the city and there was pedestrian traffic and most of the eds, we're targeting vehicles, not foot patrols, but whether in a vehicle or on foot. The IUD for the most part has been the biggest threat and the biggest cause of casualties in our recent wars. And for the enemy, it's a low risk, high reward weapon. And for us it's an evil weapon. It's a cowardly weapon and it is an effective weapon. It's a weapon that plants itself in your mind always there.

Speaker 2:          00:08:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:08:03       Waiting around that corner under that curb on the other side of that sidewalk,

Speaker 2:          00:08:17       it's waiting. Now

Speaker 1:          00:08:24       there are those whose job it is to actually interdict that weapon, the, the IED. It is their job to face that fear up close and personal day in and day out. You've got EOD explosive ordinance disposal is one group that does it. Complete professionals and the EOD technicians that I deployed with in the seal teams were just outstanding in everything that they did, which by the way was not only find in disarm IED, they also did everything that we did. They'd cleared rooms and patrol through the streets and maneuvered in firefights just as the seals did. They were awesome. And in addition to EOD combat engineers in the army and the Marine Corps also do mine clearance. And of course I talk about combat engineers a lot.

Speaker 2:          00:09:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:33       Because of the incredible role that they played in the battle of Ramadi and the combat engineers were outstanding in their standard job of building combat outposts. And building and maintaining the, the infrastructure of the bases. And they were, they were awesome in that performance under fire. But at some point the combat engineers job morphed into mine clearance and it's because I would suspect, you know, they work with demolitions. So, so combat engineers do breaches two doors into walls, they build bridges, roads and bridges and they also clear obstacles from roads and bridges. And so eventually at some point this morphed into combat engineers doing IED clearance both on roads and then out on foot patrols. Now there's jobs in the world that I wouldn't want to do and this is one of them. It takes a massive amount of patients.

Speaker 2:          00:10:55       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:56       It takes an incredible amount of skill and it takes an incredible ability to overcome fear to, if you're going to actually seek out and touch the thing, the very thing that is trying to kill you in order to stop it.

Speaker 2:          00:11:15       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:11:16       that's a job that I didn't want then and I don't want now. And I am thankful that there was others that stepped up and did that job. And I'm honored to have on the podcasts tonight, one of those brave men, a Marine Corps combat engineered who served in Iraq and in Afghanistan. And the guy by the way, who wrote that opening description of what it was like to go out and hunt

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       for ids. Guy By the name of Mr Rob Jones. Rob, welcome to the show. This is an, this is an honor for me to be, I just really appreciate, appreciate you giving me the opportunity to, to come on the show. All man, trust me, the honors all, all ours off a thousand percent. You can't even argue with that point. We won't let it happen. Uh, give us just before we jump into your Marine Corps career, just give us a little pre marine corps background on growing up and what that, where that was and what it was like. Can I answer your question about how it combat engineers came to find it yet? Please do. So when you go to combat engineer school, one of the things they teach you is minefield and placement and defeat. You do that, you use mine detectors and metal detectors. So I think that's the main reason that it, uh, I wonder at what point you think that came from World War II?

Speaker 3:          00:12:52       I don't know. That's a good question because, yeah, when I said it morphed into, I was thinking like back, it must have been sometime in World War II where they said, okay, we're, we're, we're gonna get over this river. Okay. So common engineer's going to get over the river. Uh, we're going to, um, secure this compound. Okay. We're going to secure the compound or we're going to rebuild this compound. Okay. Well at some point they said, you know what, what if there's mines there? Okay, well we've got to get them cleared out. Yeah. So at some point they realize that you can't build if you can't clear it, right? Yeah. And you can't move if you can't clear. So he's got to do it. Somebody's got to do it. And, and they weren't able to slough off that job on to somebody else, which is what I, what I would have been trying to do, which is what I would have been absolutely been trying to do.

Speaker 3:          00:13:36       Like, Hey, can we get somebody else to do that jump? Uh, yeah. So that's good. So, so how'd you end up with a Marine Corps? Oh yeah. My background, I grew up in on a farm. Uh, nothing really special about my upbringing. The side cut a farm that was a horse farm. Um, I hated horses because I have to pick up this. What is, what do you do? What is the purpose of our horse farm? The farm that I grew up on, the purpose of it was my parents would take people on horseback riding trips, pay them money, and they take him out for a couple hours in the forest. Got It. Got It. And so it was my duty to clean up after the horses, feed the horses, stack their hay bales in the summertime, get them their water. So I didn't really enjoy the horses as much as most people would. But uh, you know, I'm thankful that I had that experience because I think it did instill in me a work ethic that doesn't debt a lot of people don't get. Yeah. I think when you come from, cause you know a lot of guys when they come in the military that they've never worked hard before. But the guys I've met in the military that came from some kind of a farming background, they're like, Hey, I'm so happy here. I'm up at three in the morning,

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       you know, milking cows or whatever, or cleaning up horse shit. In your case.

Speaker 5:          00:15:00       The number of times I had to wheel this wheel barrel full of manure up a offense board onto this big

Speaker 4:          00:15:07       pile. And the were times I fell off that thing every time like this, curse those horses, I hated them so much. Now I like horses fine that I don't have gotten over. You're a horse PTSD and so what you, you, you graduated from high school and then you, you went to college, right? Yeah, I went to Virginia Tech.

Speaker 5:          00:15:26       Uh, I was actually a computer science major. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:15:31       I'm already suspect. I'm impressed. That goes impressed. I'm suspect

Speaker 5:          00:15:37       point during that, uh, during my college career, my sophomore year, I decided that computer science was not for me.

Speaker 4:          00:15:46       And how have you feel? Betrayed. And I decided,

Speaker 5:          00:15:53       I dunno, I felt like I had spent the first 20 years of my life kind of looking after myself and now I needed to do something that was beyond my own self interest. And a buddy of mine had just joined the Marine Corps. So I read a couple books about the Marine Corps Brotherhood of heroes about the battle, the Palae Lu and I said, Yep, that's what I want to do. I want to join the Marine Corps. So before telling my parents before telling anybody looked up where the recruiter was, went down there, he wasn't there, marine corps recruiter wasn't there. Air Force recruiter tells me to come in his office and tells me about the air force and I said he had just told me when the Marine Corp,

Speaker 4:          00:16:36       yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:16:37       nothing against the air force. But I had already decided on marine corps and so I joined up

Speaker 4:          00:16:45       I, this may be right or wrong, I'm pretty sure it's right. The Marine Corps has the like the lowest a recruiting budget and they have the highest recruiting numbers because it's the Marine Corps

Speaker 5:          00:16:57       there. Their approach, I guess it was like, Oh, you want to be one of us, right? Maybe. Yeah. See if you can. Good luck. I do. Yeah. Um, so I joined up as a reservist, my original plan because I was after my junior year, so I wanted to finish college at least. So my original plan was I did the 92 day reservists program where I went to boot camp after my junior year. And then I finished my last year of uh, college and then I went to job school and MCT.

Speaker 4:          00:17:27       How did your academic performance change or did it between pre boot camp and post boot camp?

Speaker 5:          00:17:35       It didn't a whole lot because I think I kind of checked out a college after my junior year. I was like, I just want to go deploy it, but I just kind of want to get this degree done just so I have it. Um, now after I deployed a few a couple times and had a little bit more life experience would probably be a lot different. But just those three months at bootcamp didn't really change my, your academic academic approach. I was funny. Smart. I was smart enough, I just didn't care that much about it anymore. Um, so my, my original plan was to do that and then have the, a little bit of experience as an, uh, an enlisted guy and then you use my degree to become an officer. But when I was in engineer school after that, that second summer, my company, my reserve company said we're sending a volunteer platoon to Iraq. So I said, well, that's the whole reason I joined up was to go fight the war. So screw being an officer, I'm going to deploy. And so then we go to my first appointment.

Speaker 1:          00:18:38       So, um, I thought it was pretty, you got a good note in here about, uh, about the Marine Corps and I'm just going to, I'm just going to read this. I'm taking this stuff from your, your journal that you have online, which is awesome reed. So here we go. Back to the journal. The Marine Corps began to shape me long before I ever have ever arrived at boot camp in Parris Island, South Carolina, Carolina. It started when I read the book Brotherhood of Heroes, the tail of the battle of how Lou in World War II. It was through the stories of the of the Marines told and those pages that I was introduced to, the courage, Spirit, tenacity, altruism and brotherhood that the marines possess, qualities that I would soon be ingrained with as well. The basics of these qualities were taught to me and my fellow recruits in bootcamp through rudimentary but effective means the proverbial stick.

Speaker 1:          00:19:38       It was through punishment that we were shown what it meant to possess. The attributes of a marine punishment would come in a variety of modes based on the same comp concept, countless pushups, sit ups, sprinting, caring, and of course screaming. The drill instructors would use any excuse, not that they needed one to inflict pain upon us, not being loud enough, looking in the wrong place in perfection, in uniform, dirty squad bay and not moving fast enough for their inspections to name a few. The reality of the situation was that we were never loud enough, always looking in the wrong place, never had perfect uniforms. The squad bay was always too dirty and we were simply too slow. The idea wasn't simply to pointlessly inflict pain, but to teach lessons using the pain as the instructor. It was to force us to make ourselves better, so the whole platoon as a whole would be better.

Speaker 2:          00:20:37       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:38       The idea was to form a brotherhood through shared suffering and shared dependence. It was to teach us to keep fighting pain so that

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       the platoon as a whole could stop being punished. The point was that once we reached perfection, the requirements changed so that we were forced to constantly reach for it, thus forcing us to become better than we ever knew we could be. This is how the Marine Corps takes hunks of iron and turns them into juvenile steel.

Speaker 4:          00:21:13       That's why the Marine Corps doesn't need a lot of recruiting money, but so true, and I liked that. I liked what you pointed out, the shared dependence and how when you're going through bootcamp scenarios and training scenarios that are really hard, you realize that you're not going to be able to do this alone and you're going to have to rely on these other guys who you may not in the civilian world you wouldn't have even been associated with and now you're not only associated with them, you depend on them for, for your survival and to get through it. And that's, I think that's what makes, that's what makes that military experience. And certainly the Marine Corps does an outstanding job of it. They think of formulating that bond that is is unique to the military.

Speaker 5:          00:22:05       Yeah, that's what, that's the thing that makes marines what they are and, and brings out the best in people's when they're doing something, not for their own self interest, but for somebody else. And I would volunteer for the worst stuff so that I could prevent my buddies from having to do it. Like walking through the Euphrates river, looking for whatever, trying to find weapons caches in Iraq, and then getting back at the end of the day, just totally soaked and covered in trash water, you know, and they come in and say, we're doing it again. Who wants to go and be like, yeah, I'll go, I'll go again. You know? And that's, I think that's why I really, I kind of enjoyed the combat engineer role too because I'm going out there protecting people, protecting my buddies, protecting other marines, and taking the risk on me. And I mean, that's what being a marine is all about. Anybody else would've done it too.

Speaker 4:          00:23:07       Yeah. And so you go your first deployment to Iraq and, um, what was that deployment like? Where'd you go? Uh, how Binya over? So this is 2008 to 2000 names are pretty mellow at 2008. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:23:23       UH, Iraqi kind of slowed down at that point wasn't much going on. We had one tiny little incident where we were on a convoy and some guy knows were fired, maybe three Ak rounds and then ran away. And it was still, you know, nothing and that, but that was in like the first couple of weeks. It's like,

Speaker 4:          00:23:47       what was your response to the three rounds from an AK 47? I continued sitting in the back of the seven ton, dude, a dude, like an 18 year old, uh, lance corporal unload with 700 rounds of 50 cal or

Speaker 5:          00:24:00       no, it was a long convoy. So it was way up there and I was like, oh, I got to get out. I gotta get up there. But it was, it was over.

Speaker 4:          00:24:09       Did they shoot back? Did they returned fire at him?

Speaker 5:          00:24:11       No, I don't think so. I mean, he, like, he did one of those things where he raised over and then left by the time anybody who was able to figure out where he was and it's gone. So that was, but that was in the first couple of weeks, so it was kind of off to a good start. And then, uh, oh, nothing else happened really.

Speaker 4:          00:24:29       So what were you guys doing during that deployment?

Speaker 5:          00:24:32       I guess it was kind of the, uh, the build portion of, uh, of the strategy at that point. You know, we were, we were helping the local population build up their cities build. We were helping to build a, uh, Iraqi police stations. And, but what I spent most of my time doing was when we would go out and find buried weapons caches, so just these old stores of Rpgs and stuff that the al Qaeda used to be using, but they had just left there. And then, so the local population would sort of, somebody would give us a tip, right? And we would go out to this big field and they'd say, yeah, it's supposedly somewhere in here. There's a, a weapons cache. So we take out a metal detectors and sweep every square inch of that field or hill or wherever we were, tree tree line. And until we either does certain, determined there was nothing, or we would find it and we dig it up and stack it, and then EOD would come and

Speaker 4:          00:25:36       blow it up. And were you attached to a, uh, like an a combat engineer platoon for or where you're attached to an infantry platoon?

Speaker 5:          00:25:43       Yeah. So the way it works for the, what we call division side engineers, like combat engineer battalion is one combat engineer platoon is attached to an infantry battalion. And then you kind of break it down. So one squad of that platoon goes with each company and then one team goes with the platoon. So you kind of help that put tune out a just pretty much attached to them. The entire,

Speaker 4:          00:26:08       so when you guys would be doing these clearances of like, let's say a big field, it would be a platoon, a Marine Corps platoon, and you would be doing all, all the sweeping.

Speaker 5:          00:26:18       Yeah. So it'd be a Marine Corps platoon or squad. He used to be a squad Lod would, uh, we'd go out on a squad patrol troll out there. They would set up security on the area and they would just wait. And then you'd be me and one other guy and we would sweep and sometimes we would have one of the infantry guys have a e tool. And be like Dick there and then he would dig and

Speaker 4:          00:26:42       nothing. And then would you, when you'd find

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       caches, would you guys blow them in place or would you recover it? I guess it would depend. We would take pictures of what we found so we could write the report when we got back and if it was out in the middle of nowhere, a lot of the times they would, they'll blow it in place. We have to wait for EOD. They wouldn't let us do it.

Speaker 4:          00:27:02       That's actually really jacked up. I it's so stupid. It's so jack. Cause there was only one EOD unit for EOD guys for the entire battalion. And not to mention that's the fun part. That quickly. Right.

Speaker 5:          00:27:17       I know how to, they used to back in like 2005 combat engineers were doing all that all the time. He just lay it out and you just sympathetically designated with the sticker.

Speaker 4:          00:27:27       That's all it is. It's because the war slowed down. Yeah. Slows down. All of a sudden people start putting the rules and regulations in weight and we could have Eud do that.

Speaker 5:          00:27:36       No one has that same thing. We had the heaviest, I've, I'm sure when you guys were in Ramadi, you just had the standard flak vest. We had this ridiculous turtle shell, Front sappies back, sappy side, sappies neck protector, groin protector, everything but protector. Like it was just the, the vest itself was 70 pounds.

Speaker 4:          00:28:01       Let me tell you something interesting about that. When we were in Ramadi, not everyone had that and everyone wanted it and okay. They did their best. I remember actually, uh, the kernel, the brigade coming down and bringing side Sapi plates down to combat outpost to hand them out to guys because everybody wanted them. They wanted the neck protectors, the shoulder protectors, the groin protectors. They wanted everything. I mean, most I'll have many guys just, hey, you, you know, especially if you're sitting in a turret or, yeah, like load me up. I want all that, the neck. And they wanted it all because it was gnarly.

Speaker 5:          00:28:38       Yeah. And then go try and do a hit on a house with it.

Speaker 4:          00:28:42       Yeah, no, that, that part's not fun. But,

Speaker 5:          00:28:45       uh, but so it's probably that same thing where they're just coming up with all the safety rules and you have to have your helmet, gloves, eye protection on at all times when you're outside the wire. So for whatever reason, they didn't let us blow it up. So we'd have to wait for EOD to come out and then they would either blow it up there if it was out in the middle of nowhere. But if it was in the city, they would usually take it somewhere.

Speaker 4:          00:29:07       And meanwhile the rest of the combat engineer battalion are out helping with the building, the structures, building schools, helping the infrastructure and stuff like that.

Speaker 5:          00:29:17       It would depend, I mean, yeah. So whatever that platoon that they were attached to was doing, they'd just be doing that. And then every now and then if they needed all of us back to build up an Iraqi police station, they would call everybody in or everybody. But a couple of guys in and then we'd all go out as a platoon to build that. Got It. But I spent most of my time just doing the cash, sweeping and going on patrol.

Speaker 4:          00:29:39       So within the platoon or certain people as

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       like mine sweepers or does everyone get trained in that? Everybody should be able to do it. Got It. How come you kept getting the, cause you've volunteered for that. You said, hey, I'll go find these. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:29:53       And my fire team was more, my squad was kind of, we didn't want to do the construction and stuff cause we thought it was boring. I wasn't great at can I can swing a hammer, but you know, I wasn't like good at it. Um, and so we kind of tried to put ourselves in positions where we wouldn't have to go do that stuff. We tried to always be out with the, with the squads, with the platoons as often as we could so we could avoid the construction stuff. But then yeah, that's what I wanted it to be doing. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:30:26       Yeah. Be Out on patrol. Yeah, exactly. So then that deployment, you come home and you had already graduated from college at this point, right? Yeah. And so you come home and then what happens when you get home? So what's your plan when you get home?

Speaker 5:          00:30:39       When I get home, well, so we were in Iraq and my buddy, uh, Ronnie and Daniel, we were all drinking and we were like, that was not what we wanted.

Speaker 3:          00:30:51       You know what the good thing is when you're drinking, that's when you make your best military decisions about what to do with your career. But yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:30:58       Well you were just sitting there. Go ahead. That was not what we were hoping it would be. Um, we wanted to do some fighting, do some killing. Um, so we were like, we got to figure out a way to go to Afghanistan. And so we started trying to look up cause we were in the reserve. So sometimes there's, there's programs where you can be an augmentee, an individual. Augmentee

Speaker 3:          00:31:25       did you have a civilian job at this point? I didn't cause I just graduated college. Just graduated college. Then you go on deployment, then you'd come home and now you're saying, all right, what do, how do I get back? How do I, how do I go fight? I had 25,000 bucks from deployment, so I bought a motorcycle, you know. Yup. That's good investment. Good longterm investment crashes. But yeah, so I was looking at,

Speaker 5:          00:31:47       I was looking for a job to tide me over and trying everything I could to go to Afghanistan. But luckily it was pretty shortly after we got back, we go to drill and company says sitting volunteer platoon to Afghanistan and boom right here. Cause Afghanistan was heating up at this time, if you remember. But, but we had still had to wait about eight or nine months before we went to the workup for that. So I just took a job putting out traffic counters, like there's a little to go across the road and you attached a little electronic box to it. So I just took a job doing that.

Speaker 3:          00:32:26       That's sorta like related to IED, isn't that a little bit of, it's on the side of the road, you know, fresh water fish wire on the road. That, and it just got in shape and partied. Now did you, did you do more drill once

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       you're, uh, getting ready to deploy?

Speaker 5:          00:32:44       Uh, yeah. Well, uh, so when I say drill I guess I should explain that's the, the deal, uh, for reservists, do you go in

Speaker 4:          00:32:51       when weekend? One weekend. A month. So your drill, that's called the drill. Yeah. Did they escalate that at all when you're going to deploy?

Speaker 5:          00:32:58       Yeah. So they kind of, they kind of cater the drills that you do based on what, what you got to need upcoming. So I do recall we did a couple where we would do go a go do a, like an IED training, uh, section. And then we would, since I had experience now we would just take, whenever we were at a drill, we would just start training the other, the new guys that were going to be going with us on machine guns, metal detectors, and just try getting them trained up. But yeah. And so a lot of the training was kind of on our own because you only get that one weekend a month and they only have so much money and they have to train the whole company as opposed to just the platoon that's going. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:33:46       So, so then do they activate you? How far before deployment do they activate? You see, you can do some legitimate real training.

Speaker 5:          00:33:54       We, so we did that. We actually managed to get a month at Camp Lejune at courthouse bay, which is the combat engineer a school. And so we did manage to get a month long school of, you know, just doing demolition, a refreshment, uh, more IED stuff, patrol practice, you know, just doing all sorts of training like that. And then your workup is pretty much just however long it takes to do Mojave Viper with your battalion and then maybe a month before that.

Speaker 4:          00:34:28       Yeah. So, so maybe three months total before you're going on for three, four months. Got It. And were you, uh, with the rest of the guys? So it's one platoon that's going one platoon, one puts, it wasn't even a full Patina. There's three squads. Okay. So how many guys that total?

Speaker 5:          00:34:45       It was actually even short squads too. So it was a, let me think each other. There was a fire to nine, 10, 11 per squad and then three for the, the brass

Speaker 4:          00:34:58       platoon. So back then you go, you do your desert drill and everyone's unified in the new d leave before that, and then, then you, and then you go on deployment.

Speaker 5:          00:35:10       Yeah. So they give you a little bit of a, yeah, they give you a little bit of leaf before you, uh, have to go over and it's like four or five days. So everybody flies home and then

Speaker 4:          00:35:20       got it comes back. So now you show up in Afghanistan and what's, how's that different from Iraq?

Speaker 5:          00:35:27       You know what, the first portion of it was not that different. Um, the terrain was a lot different. So where'd, where'd you first

Speaker 4:          00:35:37       go?

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       So, uh, in Afghanistan we were at, we started, I was, I deployed with three, seven as an attachment, third battalion, seventh Marine Corps regimen. And we were in Dell Rom, which I, I'm pretty sure it was in Helmand province. It was kind of right on the border, so I don't recall exactly, but, and pretty much kilo company was the company that my squad was attached to and they got sent out just in the middle of nowhere to a file. And then they had a patrol base that was even smaller. You didn't even further out that I got sent to, I was a team leader and so usually you would have one team in the one spot in one team in the other spot. But since we were kind of short on guys, it was pretty much, I was the only engineer for that platoon. And yeah, so we were in, in Dell Rom and so, and how Binya was urban, everything was able walking through a city, everything was urban, but Afghanistan was just barren. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:36:40       And what, when you got out to this Ford base, what would you do? What were you guys doing out there? What was the, what was the infantry thing that you were attached to you doing out there?

Speaker 5:          00:36:48       Uh, patrolling. So it was kind of similar. That's why I say it wasn't a whole lot different from Iraq because we were basically just interacting with the local populace, uh, find out what they needed, providing security for that area. Like they had a bizarre, that would come every weekend. So we'd go out, provide security for that. And so I was still using my metal detector to clear danger areas if we can. There's a lot of Wattis out there, so we'd have to funnel through the Wadi. So I checked that. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:37:18       how often were you where you find in Ids and that information?

Speaker 5:          00:37:21       I didn't find a one on there now. There was, it was a pretty pacified area. I think we had one firefight that one of the squads got into and that's it. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:37:31       so, so your first part of the deployment and how long was that? How long was that part of the deployment?

Speaker 5:          00:37:35       That was two and a half, three months I think. So there's kind of like a little tuneup, right. And then we pass that area off to the Georgian army and that's when we moved to Sangin to, to take over from the Brits

Speaker 4:          00:37:51       and now saying in Zen, like that's the Hellman province central. Right. I mean that's, that's, that's it.

Speaker 5:          00:37:57       Yeah. That's Taliban central down there. Uh, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:38:01       And as soon as you get on the ground there, did you feel it when you got on the ground?

Speaker 5:          00:38:05       We knew. Yeah. I mean we kind of did a push into that area before we actually moved out there and we knew shit was getting real when we, uh, they just, they're like pack up a pack and we got on the helicopter and they just flew us out and just dropped us off in the middle of absolutely nowhere. And we just started walking it, just leave your packs here and start walking that way and just, just basically just taking territory from the Taliban.

Speaker 4:          00:38:39       Now did you, do guys do a thorough turnover with them

Speaker 5:          00:38:42       Brits? I wasn't a part of that, but not really. I mean we, we pretty much came into Fabi Anchorman and we're there for a day, day and a half. And then the Brits were gone. No, no.

Speaker 4:          00:38:56       Oh, we left. And then, yeah, you pushed out. So the Brits were there when you were, when you were there on the ground. We were both there at the same time. Probably the headquarters elements. We're doing a turnover. Yeah. They were like, hey, we're getting our boys out,

Speaker 5:          00:39:07       pushing immediately. And we had a couple world marines with us and it's in British army or this, I think they had a small or maybe a toe that we didn't have. So like units that we, we needed from them, they would send out with us and they were great. Um, but uh, from what I understood, they just didn't have the manpower to really do much

Speaker 4:          00:39:29       where they, the guys that were with you, were you, were they giving you any turnover items? Like, Hey, you need to look out for this. Hey, this is what's going on here. No. Were you doing

Speaker 5:          00:39:36       receive any cause I don't think they really went out much so I don't, not really sure how much they really could have told us about what was outside of the patrol basis. And I never, I don't even remember. I think we may have talked to their combat engineers, we've got some demo from them like hey can we have some deck decourt and they gave it to us and that's about it. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:39:58       And that's cause they were just completely undermanned.

Speaker 5:          00:40:00       Yeah. The, from what I understand, I mean I obviously I'm not a part of the upper echelon out there and stuff, but I think that's the reason they just, they set up a patrol base and they had the patrol bases, but they pretty much just sat there and got ambushed and got shot at every day and didn't do a whole lot of patrolling.

Speaker 4:          00:40:16       So then you guys roll in and the like, the broad strategy is you're going to start moving from patrol base, you're going to push out, take another compound, secure it, and then operate out of there for awhile and then push, push on.

Speaker 5:          00:40:30       Pretty much just take the Taliban's territory, um, by going out, clearing a compound. And that's what a major part of what I was doing it on. This push was clearing compounds just in case there are a booby trapped and then we, yeah, we take over that compound, sandbag it up, knocked down some trees and some explosives, create those fields of fire. And then once I was set up to start doing some patrols, security patrols and then

Speaker 4:          00:41:00       repeat. And where are you guys getting in contact with the Taliban? Yeah, more often. They were pretty much shooting at us

Speaker 5:          00:41:06       most days. Mortaring us most days. Not very accurate.

Speaker 6:          00:41:12       MMM.

Speaker 5:          00:41:13       But yeah, they were shooting at us at least. And we, we would go out on patrols, they'd shoot at us.

Speaker 6:          00:41:18       MMM.

Speaker 5:          00:41:19       But they're always shooting from way far away. And you know, we'd shoot back, but it wasn't like further on in the deployment when the corns, when the corn grew a lot taller. I wasn't there for it cause I got hurt by them. But that was when they were like, people were shooting at each other in the cornfield like five feet away. So,

Speaker 4:          00:41:40       so, but, but while you were there, it was more distant, really far distant contact. We were you guys taking any casualties?

Speaker 5:          00:41:49       I think not, not times. I mean obviously every one is a major, major sacrifice. But, uh, there was one sniper that got killed, uh, on the initial push on Lusa Cola before we even got to Sangin. And besides that, I don't remember. Oh, my buddy Ron, he got hit in the face with a piece of RPG. Um, he didn't go home, he just had to go get it taken care of. So minor stuff like that.

Speaker 4:          00:42:19       But yeah, minor stuff only happens when stuff is going on. And by the way, that little piece of shrapnel, you know, that thing can kill you just as easily as a, you know, a full piece of shrapnel. Yeah, exactly. Um, but I would say so. So you're, you're like now every patrol that you guys are going out is like, hey, now how, how often are you finding ids at this point?

Speaker 5:          00:42:45       Not Tons. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:42:49       okay.

Speaker 5:          00:42:50       Trying to think. And then not very often. Yeah. I mean cause the, I think the area that we were in initially was still pretty close to the main farb and then as you went out there would be, um, just fields of them. And the way that we were getting out to the, the patrol basis, we were using Mikulics. And so that was mitigating a lot of the searching that we would've had to do. Um, so in that initial area weren't finding tons, just every, every now and then.

Speaker 4:          00:43:26       And I, I don't, I don't know if this is right or not, but do you know what the closer you get to a fob, do you have security on the fob? You have guys that are looking out. So it's hard for someone to come in and dig out and put it in an IED in the ground. So you're, you got some level of security around the fobs most of the time. Obviously there could be something there. Preexisting and um, day to day life. What are you guys, are you guys on the Mras? Are you guys getting chow or what's, what's going on day to day life?

Speaker 5:          00:43:54       Man, I wished we had MRI. So at some point during the deployment we started on Mras and I, you know, I like Mrs. I think there were good, you're sick.

Speaker 4:          00:44:08       I used to like him Mre is a point. I was like 22 and then I oded on them.

Speaker 5:          00:44:14       Yeah, I didn't, I didn't mind them too much. But then when we started doing these pushes, we got these things called first strike rations and like the new MRE. But here's the problem with these first, right? They were awesome when we first got on the first week. They were awesome. But the Marine Corps only decided to do it would be good to buy three different meals and kind of at the same time we had outrun our water supply, so we were just stopping off at wells and guess what? Nobody be kind of purifying stuff. Um, so we were just drinking well water and obviously what you would expect to happen happened. Everybody was getting sick. Jazz, you know, diarrhea, vomiting.

Speaker 4:          00:45:03       That's crazy. No purification tabs or no,

Speaker 5:          00:45:06       I guess maybe they didn't expect us to need to use wells, but the first day everybody ran out of water by the, by the time we ended and we're like, well, we just got to go get well water.

Speaker 4:          00:45:17       Isn't that crazy? A purification pill is like, I'm talking at you echo like it's a little tiny thing. We, you can carry them so easily and they completely changed the game because you can take that water out of the well or a stream that's got whatever bacteria on it. Put that pillow, put that thing in there, shake it up, you're good to go. Does it taste different? No, not really. Not really. If people use them. Camping. Yeah. This iodine tablets. And you can also bring a filter. Like when I hike, I bring a filter, which is a little Plinko Britta pump. No, it's not a Brita pitcher. Knows about that. A little pump. A little pump. And how long are you guys going out in the field for?

Speaker 5:          00:45:56       Um, let's see. The first push Nimbus cloud was about two weeks. And so we just, yeah, walk for two weeks. We walked to a compound stop for the day, set security, spend the night, walk to the next one. If they shoot at us, fight back, kill him, whatever, do whatever we got to do. And then we just kept pushing out and pushing out. And then eventually we got to a point in that first, most of Galop push where, uh, for whatever reason they just, they just said, all right, now you're going to walk back. I think, I think maybe our, uh, I think maybe our battalion commander had actually been a little bit too aggressive and had gone beyond his limits that his boss wanting him to do. So we ended up having to give up territory we had just taken and yeah, so that one was two weeks. But then once we got to Sangin it was pretty much spend a day doing the push, take the compounds and then you kind of in the compound you just go out and patrol and then you come back. So we weren't really out in the field field, uh, for all that long. But you know, being in a compound still not exactly luxury.

Speaker 4:          00:47:13       Yeah. You still want to have showers or it's not the Kona Kai resort. Definitely. All right man. I'm going to talk about, I'm going to go to your journal here

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       cause obviously on one of these uh, patrols you got hit and here's what you wrote about it.

Speaker 2:          00:47:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:41       Two things happened simultaneously when whatever explosive device that hit me exploded. First the shockwave cut through my toes, severing them, it didn't slow as it cut through my shins, severing them. Next, it's sent dirt, Grit and shrapnel upward into my legs, buttocks, and any other part of my body that was exposed.

Speaker 2:          00:48:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:10       Next. It launched me a few feet into the air and deposited me onto the ground. Unconscious blood was pouring out of the newly opened arteries and into the dirt.

Speaker 2:          00:48:22       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:48:22       Muscle and bone dangled from the remnants of my legs.

Speaker 2:          00:48:27       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:48:28       Vicious bacteria latched on and invaded through the note. New Openings. The dust rose

Speaker 2:          00:48:36       and settled and I woke up

Speaker 1:          00:48:41       the first 10 seconds after waking up all I could hear where my own screams all I could see you as a blurry tunnel looking up to the sky. The weird thing about the screams was that my brain wasn't telling my body to produce them. It was almost as if my mind was no longer present and my body was just reacting or more like panicking.

Speaker 2:          00:49:07       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:49:07       They were the kindest screams that are emitted from a person regardless of the consideration of the personal pride that the person has, no matter how much their pride makes them resist crying out, they don't have a choice in the matter. They inhale to lungfuls of air, open their mouth as wide as it will go and expel that air with full force producing a scream that pierces the air and change his pitch with no control. As seconds clicked away, my mind started to come back online and my body calmed down.

Speaker 2:          00:49:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:47       I stopped screaming and my other sense is returned. I smelled dust and the unique chemical spell of the recent explosion. I tasted it on my tongue and in my throat. After that, my feeling came back. It wasn't so much pain as one would imagine it, but more like my lower legs had fallen asleep for so long that it hurt except magnified by 50 times. I knew that they were gone, but how much,

Speaker 2:          00:50:21       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:22       I had decided before I left on this deployment that I could live with below the knee amputations, but anything higher than that, no thanks. I'd rather bleed out. I could hear Keith Johnson telling me that they were coming for me and soon he and Shane Ottewell were over me applying tourniquets to the bleeding stumps that used to be legs. I mustered up the courage to look at my hands intact. I move them downward to check on something vastly more important.

Speaker 2:          00:50:56       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:50:57       The numbness I felt down there left me unsure of its status, just kill me. I croaked out. They ignored me of course and kept telling me how everything was going to be okay. They were holding my hands as the corpsman knelt over me and delivered the sweet, sweet morphine that made it all better.

Speaker 2:          00:51:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:18       Kill me man. I said again. I don't want to live like this. I think my dick is gone. Your Dick is still there, man. Do you want me to touch it? Johnson asked. I chuckled. Were with relief as I replied. No. I asked whether the lug legs were gone above or below the knee. I was reassured to hear that both were a few inches below. By this time I was high from the morphine and was saying everything that crossed my mind. As the corpsman continued to work and we waited for the 10 line CAS evac to be called in. I thought about all the things I wouldn't be doing anymore. I thought about playing racket ball. I thought about working out in the gym. I thought about being in a wheelchair for the next 50 years. I never thought about how I was breeding, bleeding profusely from two major arteries and could die. I never once thought I would die, which may seem unusual for a person in my position. Naturally optimistic, I suppose. Although it is hard to claim that I was being optimistic considering I wanted to cash out permanently. In my defense, I had no idea what life was like as an amputee and if I had back then, I wouldn't have made that request

Speaker 1:          00:52:42       either way. I'm glad I stuck around. Around this time I decided to sit up and take a look at the damage. I took a deep breath and gulped. I slowly started sitting up, but when I got to the point where going further would reveal my shredded legs, I had a change of heart. I didn't see the blood soaked dirt. I didn't see the disjointed lower parts of my calves and Chins along with my feet or the jagged edge of my remaining limbs. The skin roughly burned and shorten the bone sticking out. Then the rip muscle dangling along the ground. I didn't want

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       that image to be inside of my head because I knew it would be one that I would never be able to forget.

Speaker 1:          00:53:33       I deeply regret the fact that there are those that I consider friends that were forced to have that image in their mind and will have to live with with it for their entire lives. Secondly, I was afraid of seeing the wound would make it hurt even more, much like a scraped knee. As a child, I laid back down and let the morphine keep doing its job. I started getting sleepy. I just wanted to close my eyes. I thought maybe if I closed my eyes, I would pass away easily. Slap Atwell's hand slap my cheek as he yelled at me to stay awake. Just let me sleep. Just let me sleep. I mumbled closing my eyes again, another slap. That was the last time I did that. Finally the stretcher that was going to carry me out, arrived for strong men, lifted me onto it, grab each one of the handles and started carrying me to an assault breach or vehicle. They were carrying me away from the war I volunteered to participate in and the marines that I was supposed to be leading and protecting, they would have to go on without me all because I had failed in my job, failed to find the Iud that I knew was somewhere around us.

Speaker 1:          00:54:59       That failure was a hard pill to swallow then and it remains so. To this day I didn't feel good about leaving them behind, but I knew they would understand. I knew they would be okay without me. We got to the assault breach or vehicle and I asked Jimmy Goodwin one last time to put me out of my misery after his refusal. That was the last time I ever contemplating accepting that avenue. They slid me into the back of the vehicle and with some marines I had never met whose faces I can remember seeing but don't remember any of their features. The corpsman said he was going to give me something to put me to sleep and I finally got to close my eyes as everything went black.

Speaker 2:          00:55:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:05       You're pretty clear about what happened.

Speaker 5:          00:56:09       I remember it pretty lucidly, surprisingly. Yeah, I dunno. Yeah, I was, I think I was unconscious for maybe 20 seconds I would estimate because they hadn't even, it hadn't gotten to me by the time I woke up and I don't think they would have spent a whole lot of time. Yeah. I think one of my guys might have cleared over to me, but I, I, I don't know. I'm kind of wish I had thought of something better to say like

Speaker 4:          00:56:38       it got me boys like free lesson learned, preload a really cool sentence. Dramatic moment and script to go with just in case the critical point.

Speaker 5:          00:56:52       Oh Man, no, I wish I would have thought of something better than Duke do there.

Speaker 4:          00:56:58       It makes sense. Oh yeah. That's actually more important. Like I said, that's something vastly more important, but the interesting, yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:57:05       The thing about, they said I was a below the knee. And so a lot of the [inaudible] times what happens, you might be below the knee at site of injury, but like I said, infection, that dirt over there is nasty. We're not used to their bacteria. It'll get in there, it will in fact, and they have to end up chopping you off higher to save your life because of the, the infections, just uncontrollable. And also if they don't have viable tissue, bones and muscles that they can sculpt in such a way that you can put a prosthetic on there, they'll just cut you off. Where at the next, you know, viable spot, it would be

Speaker 4:          00:57:51       right. And um, there's gotta be like you, you know, you had to have known or you, you'd know this is a possibility, right? When you're over there, how much did you think about that possibility?

Speaker 5:          00:58:06       Okay. It's probably the same thing as when you were going through Amani. I mean, you know, everybody knows you could, you could die, you could get killed, but it's not going to be me. It's fine. Not going to happen. Um, but you kind of have to do that, don't you? I mean, if you, if you, if I'm sitting in there sweeping and I'm thinking, okay, here we go. This could be it every step. I'm not going

Speaker 4:          00:58:30       effective. Yeah. There's gotta be whether people refer to it the way I referred to as the, like the idea of detachment. And you're just like, not going to think about that. Everybody must be doing that because otherwise she'd go freaking crazy. Like if you were just thinking this next step could be the one, I don't know, you, you'd never be able to take a step. You could handle it. And you go out there on patrol and you see Marines and soldiers and the seals, they bear, no, everyone's doing their job. Just completely setting that fear aside and saying, okay, that's possibility. Cool. I don't have time to worry about that right now. I'm going to get it done.

Speaker 5:          00:59:01       But, uh, I have, I made a dark joke before I went to Afghanistan. I did this five k with a buddy and he said, all right, well, we're going to do it again. And when, when we get back from Afghan, when you get back from Afghanistan, I was like, yeah, except you're going to be pulling me in a rickshaw cause I'm going to have both my legs blown off. He has yet to pull me in the rickshaw. But I talk about, you know, fate or whatever. I don't know what, what,

Speaker 4:          00:59:38       that's just bad humor. I think that's what we call that. But you know what that is? That is a way you deal with these things, right? I mean like, hey, we were kind of talking about in the car over here, just like sick humor that you end up with in the military because you have to take that thought, which is in your head. Like he's gotta be in your head. So what are you going to do with it? Are you going to let it like burden you down and make you inoperable and make you not be able to do your job? Are you going to, you know what? We're going to make a joke about it and that's how we're going to get through this. So more than anything else, it's actually great. I shouldn't have said bad here and I should have said great humor because that's the kind of humor that we'd hear that all the time, you know, all the time from guys from my seals were ridiculous.

Speaker 4:          01:00:20       My guys are just, I mean, the sickest sense of humor you could imagine. And, but yeah, the same thing with the soldiers and there wasn't even, there's no barrier. Like there's no barrier for that sixth sense or humor when you're in the military, it's just like there and you're allowed pretty much to say it across services. You know, you can make a joke to marine or an army soldier about something and they, they're not going to beat, they're not going to be offended by it. It's everyone's got that same twisted sense of humor that really, if you think about it, we're all probably using to cope with, you know, the, the fact that these bad things might happen.

Speaker 5:          01:00:55       Yeah. I think I've often like try and wonder why they say, you know, laughter's the best medicine and why it's so true. And I think it, it acts to normalize your situation. So you know how if you're about to try and dead lift like thousand pounds per hour for you, something like that. Sure. You're trying to deadlift 8,000 pounds and you're sitting there going, there's no way I'm going to dead lift this 8,000 pounds, you're going to go up to it and it's going to stick to the ground. That predetermined a self pre determination. Right? And so if you're sitting there, let's say after I got hurt and I'm sitting there going, this is the worst thing to ever happen. This sucks. I hate this. It's so serious. It's such a big deal. Then yeah, it becomes the worst thing that ever happened. And I just kind of get into that groove.

Speaker 5:          01:01:55       But if you can make a joke about it, it kind of makes fun of it. So it's not as serious. And so when something's not as serious or not as big a deal, you make fun of something, it kind of becomes normal to you and a little bit easier to to accept. Like if you saw, if I saw my drill instructor crack a smile at any point, if you like sit this or anything like that, then they automatically lose their, their persona. So if you could tell sometimes they were getting ready to crack a smile and they'd be like, they just walk off.

Speaker 1:          01:02:33       I think you'd have to just walk away.

Speaker 5:          01:02:35       So I think, I think that that's probably why you have to maintain your humor in order to survive. You really do. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:02:44       no doubt about that. That's awesome. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:02:48       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:49       Going back to your journal here, it took me five days to make it from dusty, uncomfortable blast crater and Afghanistan to a sterile, uncomfortable hospital bed in the ICU at the Nae National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. Luckily for me, I was much too high on what's that Dilla Dilla. The loudest dilaudid. Dilaudid. Yeah. To notice the bed or the trip. My amputation said started out below the knee, but somewhere during the three hospitals stops along the way, the need rows for the remaining portions below my knees to be taken off. A lot of the time. This is due to infections that are picked up from the dirt and Afghanistan, or maybe there wasn't much that existed below the knees to keep, to make keeping them viable on the bright side. However, the stumps that were remaining were of a significant length for an above knee amputation. I was left with the entire femur on my left leg and only a few inches shy on my right leg. I found it funny that throughout my entire hospital stay, the remainder of my legs were always referred to as stumps by the medical staff. I had expected a more elegant term considering the fact that this was a hospital.

Speaker 1:          01:04:06       At the same time, however, I enjoyed the casual nature of the word stump and even considered naming them at one point later when perusing my medical records, I found the elegant term. I had been looking for residual limb along with the major injuries I sustained. I also had a few minor injuries. I use the term minor loosely here. Seeing as how these minor injuries would be considered major if they weren't sustained in tandem with the severing of one's lower legs

Speaker 1:          01:04:40       starting from the lower person portions. First, I lost a portion of the muscles making up the inner part of my right Fi. In order to close that wound, I would require a skin graft taken from the skin of my left fi my buttocks contay or sustained several large wounds from shrapnel, some close to the sphincter, but mostly in the more meaty parts. That was okay though I have always had an extra butt muscle to go around. The close proximity of these wounds to the working parts of the digestive digestive system resulted in the doctor's diverting my intestines to a colostomy bag that came through my abdominal area. The reason for doing this wasn't because of any damage to the intestines, but because the doctors wanted to make sure that the large wounds on my butt didn't get infected. As for upper body injuries, I had some minor burns to my hands and to totally perforated ear drums.

Speaker 1:          01:05:33       The hands were Keel and my ear drums would be replaced with cartilage. I consider myself extremely lucky that I still have all 10 fingers in perfect working condition, my eyes and most significantly a brain that made it through the blast with only a grade three concussion and no residual traumatic brain injuries. While I may face hardships and have some sort of discomfort constantly throughout the day as a result of wearing prosthetics, at least it doesn't hurt, hurt. I don't have constant pain. Constant pain is much more. Har Wing is a much more harrowing plight than mine and I can't imagine how hard it is to withstand. I spent my first week at Bethesda in the intensive care unit. I had a tube down my throat, one tube going into my arm, a breathing tube in my nose, a catheter pads, monitoring my heart rate, an epidural in my lower spine and a wire from my pain button. Both my hands were wrapped in gauze from my burns. My legs were all so wrapped in gauze along with having wound vac machines attached them to suck out excess fluids leaking from my wounds. My rear end had a pat of gauze for the wounds there. The incision down, the center of my abs use from our colostomy had been stapled back together. And the bottom part, parts of my stumps were where the skin was reconnected, were stitched together.

Speaker 1:          01:07:01       Man, like I, you know, you just, you, it's just piling all that, all their stuff on too. And it just, like you said, you, you lost your legs and you're like, oh, you know, that's pretty much what a guy like me, I focused, oh, he lost his legs, you know, obviously freaking horrible. And then you don't, you're like a guy like me. I'm not thinking about all these other injuries that you're sustaining and all the medical things that have to happen to get that stuff straightened out.

Speaker 5:          01:07:32       Yeah. I mean, any one of those, just like if it happened to one of us right now, any one of those would be major, but they're just pretty much nothing compared to the actual major thing that happened.

Speaker 1:          01:07:47       And, and you're just so, were you just drugged up at this point? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:07:53       Uh, that first week. I mean, yeah, just dilauded Hayes hallucinations and that kind of thing and surgeries. Um, I would hallucinate nasty things like being hit by a mortar and CMI leg splattered for whatever reason my mom was there. Uh, and then I recall for the first couple of weeks, every now and then, I don't know how to describe it with something. What happened? You felt explosions before and there's kind of that when the shockwave goes through you and you kind of feel your brain kind of jar a little bit. And I would kind of feel that. And then for a split second, I would kind of, it would be like I was getting hit by an explosion for a split second of it like that. And I'd be like, did I just, did I just pass out or something? And we'd be like, no. I was like, what is that? So, but that, you know, that

Speaker 4:          01:08:54       some kind of way, like mental aftershock.

Speaker 5:          01:08:56       Yeah, I, yeah. I don't know what it was. It's, I asked the doctors about it. They said, well, I'm never, I don't know what that is, but luckily it went away. And after maybe it had something to do with the, the drugs, I don't know. But, uh, yeah, but you know, eventually you get used to that body kind of gets adapted to it and you get your senses back. And it's hard to look at a computer screen for the first couple of weeks still. But eventually I would see ants crawling on me. Uh, but yeah, as you know, so eventually all that kind of goes away and you're just stuck with your little button for pain. I remember they, you can only hit the little only unless you hit it every three, four or five minutes or something like that. And they would come in during the first little bit and they would say, you know, you can only hit that thing like 12 times in a minute. Right. Is that, yeah. And then they say, well, you hit it about 110 times in the last hour. And I'm like, well, I'd be, I, cause I'd be kind of like falling asleep and then I'd hit it and be like, oh, make sure I make sure I got that hit the, so I just hit it again. And so, yeah. And then, but eventually kind of get used to it and then paint starts to go away.

Speaker 4:          01:10:16       I am sitting here thinking about like, I've been hospitalized a couple times for a couple of different surgeries and what a complete pussy I was, you know, in they're like, oh, this hurts. You know, and I, I, you know, this is, this is true, you know, repair something. Like I had a hernia operation, I had neck surgery. Like these are planned operations. The openings in my body were made by a highly skilled surgeon, you know, and I'm in, they're like, oh, this sucks so bad. I mean, I can't, I like what you have is like a thousand times, a thousand times worse and it's, it's hard to even imagine. And then on top of this, I'm going back to the journal here, to top it all off, I had my pirate hat on my head. I was practically being held together by duct tape, like an old dilapidated chair. You're trying to get one or one more good year out of what's up with a pirate hat. Well,

Speaker 5:          01:11:11       so you're not supposed to wake up when you go through Germany. So basically you go from site of injury to Camp Leatherneck to Bagram air force base to launch still Germany to Bethesda, Maryland for marines, and then just go straight to Walter Reed for anybody else. Marines and sailors go to Bethesda. And so for whatever reason, I wake up in Germany for, I don't know, 15, 20 minutes and my squad leader was there. Uh, he was there for something else. I don't remember what he was there for, but he, so he was there and I go, hey, you kind of told me what happened and that kind of thing. And I just, I couldn't help but think, even though it was super drugged up, it was like, my mom is gonna not and she's going to be sad. And so all I could think of, I'm always trying to crack a joke or whatever. So I was like, see if you can see if you can find a funny, he had heroin and he couldn't find one. Right. They're not going to have funny hats in a hospital. It's a serious way. So he went and looked, I guess maybe he just went outside the rooms, the, I couldn't find one.

Speaker 5:          01:12:27       A bog room has a lot of thing or Germany has a lot of things, but uh, maybe not a funny hat store. Uh, so couldn't find one. I get to Bethesda and when you get to the hospital, they pick you up from wherever they fly you into in these big basically semi tractor trailer, Haas, uh, ambulances and they, they have, they alert the hospital or we're coming, we're going to be there 2:00 PM and all the doctors come down and they rush you in and, uh, do what you need to do. And so a lot of the times that's where families will see there, there are service men when they first get back, when they're unloading them and they give them Kinda, you know, 15, 20 seconds to, hey, good to see you. And then they take you off. And I don't know how it happened, but I'm rolling down the thing and there's my mom and she has this pirate hat in her hand.

Speaker 5:          01:13:30       I don't know if somehow they got bored back to her. Still don't know. No, I haven't. I think I think somebody else brought it. I don't think she brought it, but I don't know why they would've brought me a pirate hat unless somebody had found out that I had asked for a stupid hat or something. Cause I have, I've never been known to wear pirate hats are stupid hats before. So there was my mom with a stupid hat and then so it kind of became a theme. Like people would bring me a stupid hat. What did, they came and visited me. So I had a big bag eventually. But, so I guess what happened, you know, I hope it kind of helped ease the pain little bit from my mom. And that initial, that initial, uh, meeting maybe a little bit, but uh, I dunno.

Speaker 4:          01:14:20       So then you spend, how long are you in? Are you in like Icu for where they're trying to get you more stabilized?

Speaker 5:          01:14:26       I was probably there for about a week and then you move up to the, the fifth floor for the hospital, which is kind of where they put all the amputees and there were actually three Joneses there at the time. So the nurses had to be very careful. And on top of that, my I'm Jones are our first two initials. My buddy who got hit and maybe an hour before me, his name is Jones, d d and then the third Jones was Jones, Jay Jay Dang. So they had to be on it with, you know, with checking what medic cases are going to, to who is, but yeah, so that then he'd go up to the fifth floor and that's kind of where you start to become lucid and that's where they physical therapists start to come in and that's where once you're kind of ready, like you start just lifting a leg, want 10 times, just lift your stomach.

Speaker 4:          01:15:21       Then you describe that in your journal, what it was like exhausting for you to yeah. And it hurt. And what's making it, is it because you've been laying there for so long is because it's a movement that you haven't been able to do in a while? I don't just all of the above.

Speaker 5:          01:15:35       I would imagine a lot of that stuff down there. It's just swollen and painful. You know, it's, I think that's probably what it would be. And so yeah. Uh, it hurts so bad just to even move it at all. And so they start with that and then eventually you get in your wheelchair and it takes about 10 minutes for you to get into your wheelchair and tape belt for people to get you into your wheelchair. Cause you're just like sliding off and you just so sore. But you know, eventually you get better. And I could, you know, I made a big deal about the first day that I got in my wheelchair by myself and then I would go for little rolls around the, the floor and somebody would have to like, we all, my, uh, my little ivy pole and I have to hang my catheter bag on the, that was so scared. I was, I was like, watch that tube to not let that tube get caught into anything. And so yeah, I would, I would just do a few laps around the ward, get out. And then when I was done, I go visit my buddy Daniel because he couldn't get out of bed yet cause he had a,

Speaker 5:          01:16:46       I don't, I don't know why you couldn't get out of bed, but he couldn't get out of bed. So I'd be on in his room and hang out for a little while.

Speaker 4:          01:16:51       And then how long is it before you're thinking to yourself? Okay. Or what makes you start thinking, oh, well this is my game plan. This is where I'm going with like you see guys that are further along the process and you say, okay, I see what that guy doing. You know? Yeah, I, I'm going to do that too. Well, I sent

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       a little,

Speaker 5:          01:17:11       uh, I phone message to Daniel who is too down in the store down on the fifth floor. And my body took a little, and he was like, why don't you say something to Daniel? And so I said, listen, first step, make a workout program to get back to where we were before to get on our feet again. So it was a media, I was like, we are going to just work out and we're going to get better. And you know, so they don't do a whole lot of prosthetics at Bethesda. Well they do now, but they didn't back then. And so the nurses would kind of have a general idea of how the prosthetic stuff went and the physical therapist would know. But the major thing was the visits from Walter Reed. So the wounded warrior battalion people would bring people that were further along in their recovery over to visit the guys that had just been freshly wounded. And so I got to one of those visits, I don't remember there being a double above the knee amputee that came to see me that was in legs yet, but they had a better idea. And they would say, look, you know, you're going to get over there and you're going to get your prosthetics and you're gonna be able to walk again. You're going to be able to run, you're going to be able to do this and that. And so

Speaker 5:          01:18:31       the, at that point I'm like, oh, so I'm not going to, I don't have to be in a wheelchair forever. Oh, okay. You know, so it was about at that point.

Speaker 3:          01:18:40       And then what did w how'd you develop your workout program?

Speaker 5:          01:18:44       Well, uh,

Speaker 3:          01:18:48       once I became lucid, I was doing pull ups on my little triangle. You know, how they had the little triangle thing dangling down, started getting after it. I wasn't doing well, I was doing pull ups.

Speaker 5:          01:18:57       I was probably doing like a horizontal rows or something. No, it's just like lifting myself up whenever the physical therapist couldn't come in and do her stuff with me, I was like, all right, well I'm just going to do, he's going to pull myself up on this thing. And

Speaker 5:          01:19:13       so that was, and I kind of, I went off the therapists, um, experience for the, for most of it in the, in the beginning until I kind of got on my own because I don't, you know, they're, they've been doing this for nine years at that point. So they had a lot of drills and strengthened exercises that I can do and, and that kind of thing. So I just kind of let them take the reins and just did whatever they said and then did it again. Um, but then once I got to a point where I was, were kind of like, where you see me now, I'm walking around, no problem. That's when I started venturing into trying to do regular gym stuff and I invented my own way of doing straight leg dead lifts. So it's, I strapped myself to a pole and I sent it down to leaned down and I do a straight leg dead lift as it put, cause I can't squat.

Speaker 1:          01:20:07       Right, right. Yeah. Uh, I thought this was a really cool part of your journal that you wrote and you're talking about getting through that kind of stuff. So here we go. Back to the journal is easy to be motivated to succeed in the beginning of an endeavor and when you are close to the end, the most difficult part and the part where people quit is when they are in the thick of it. And it is unclear whether they have the strength and stamina to make it the rest of the way. While I never actually doubted my ability to walk again during my recovery, I am certainly subject to the inner monologue rationalizing, why does o k to quit or to not push myself to the goal that I've written down on paper. One Way I've recognized to aid in shutting that monologue the fuck up is celebrating milestones. The hardest part of working toward a goal is when we are either making slow progress or negative progress and having the patience and confidence to know that the improvements we make over the long periods as opposed to the short periods are what matter.

Speaker 2:          01:21:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:21:25       Milestones are what reminds us that we are making progress even if it isn't a parent every day.

Speaker 2:          01:21:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:21:32       In rowing, I've heard of people that count strokes until the finish line using sets of 10. Personally I like to count two fifties for making up a race. When I ran the nation's triathlon, I picked points ahead of me to make it too. And when I got there I'd pick a new point. Anything we can use to keep our minds from succumbing to the monologue will work not only in shirt, short term goals, but also in longterm goals like graduating from college or learning to use prosthetics. Great advice for anybody to pay attention to. Now you mentioned rowing there. So this was no like a weekend row that you decided to do this. You got after it. Yeah. So how'd that come about?

Speaker 5:          01:22:24       Um, so I was, I was looking for that workout program. I knew at this point, hey, I'm alive, I'm going to still try and have the best life possible. And so I'm trying to get back what I, what I lost so to speak. And I used to like working out and go into the gym getting after it. And so, um, I'm sitting there going, well, what's the new, what's another way that I can work out now? Um, and so I started looking up, I forget what I looked up disabled sports or disabled work at like Google something

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       and Google getting Africa at Google. And

Speaker 5:          01:23:12       so the Paralympics comes up. I don't know what the heck is apparel. I know the Olympics, I don't know what the Paralympics is. Is that like the Special Olympics? And the answer to that question is no. And so the Paralympics is the Olympics for disabled people, for people with disabilities. It was like, all right, well I fit into that category. Let's see what sports they got. And I saw they had rowing I so well, you know what I used to, I used to hit the rowing machine when I was working out getting on the concept two. Yeah. The concept to doing some sprints on that thing. That was pretty tough. And I want something that's tough. So I was like, you know what, I'm going to see, I'm going to look into this rowing thing and maybe I'll, maybe I'll make the Paralympics one day and this is when I would just got to the hospital like my second week in the hospital.

Speaker 3:          01:24:08       Not, not real strong point in the page that says, Hey, you got to set yourself a goal right away. You don't have something you're working towards, then you're just,

Speaker 5:          01:24:20       yeah. Tread water. Um, and so yeah, and a lot of things fell into place. Uh, there was, uh, I probably didn't go out and try and learn to row on the water until the next year, so I was, my main focus at that point was still learning the prostate's getting my strength back. But once I kinda got my strength back and I was really, I felt like I was ready to move on kind of outside of the therapy, uh, angle on it. I looked up places where I could learn to row and just, I mean, just so happened there was one in DC. And so I went down there and I learned, and I mean I don't want to brag, but the guy said I was a natural. So, uh, this is like, well, maybe I can do this. And so I convinced the, they didn't have real machine in the physical therapy clinic at the time.

Speaker 5:          01:25:14       They had an elliptical, they had all sorts of equipment. They didn't have a rowing machine. So I convinced the clinic, whoever was running the clinic to get a rowing machine for me so I could row. And then when I was trained for the nation triathlon, I convinced them to let me bring my bike in and, and ride my bike in the clinic. So I had my own, I've starting to build my own gym inside the gym and I convinced them to get a kettle bell for me and stuff. Um, and so I convinced them to let me, uh, let me have that roll machine. And so a couple of times a week I would go down to the water and train on the water. The other times I would just do some sprints on the, on the rowing machine. And then it just kind of kept, I kept getting better. And, and this was 20,000, a 2011 so then the Paralympics or 2012. And

Speaker 3:          01:26:10       is there like a specific coach that runs the, the, the rowing team?

Speaker 5:          01:26:17       There isn't in some sports there are, there's like there's a head coach is in charge of everybody in hell train everybody. But for my category and Paralympic rowing, it's pretty much you find your own coach and you show up at this race. And if you win that race then

Speaker 3:          01:26:36       was that America and all the races for that year. How far is the row? It's a thousand meters. So what is that like? It takes you a couple minutes. Three minutes.

Speaker 5:          01:26:47       Um, so rowing, trunk and arms only, it was my category, so it would take me my best ever time on the Erg was probably like three 38, I think. Um, and that's like puke level put now. Yeah, for me. Yeah. Um, and then on the water, the best in a double. So two people, um, my category, you have to have two people in the boat was just right around four minutes. If you could do four minutes, then you had a shot at winning

Speaker 3:          01:27:23       and that's a thousand meters to, it's a thousand meters. So you're always gonna be a little bit slower on the water. And you say it's four minutes, you said? Yeah, about four minutes. So it's like a complete gut check. It's, it's the equivalent of sprinting like the mile. Yeah. Cause you're going four minutes, right? Forming a mile. I mean it's, it's no joke. It's a, it's a tough, tough, tough race. And where was the Paralympics that year?

Speaker 5:          01:27:46       Oh, the Paralympics. We're in London in 2012. And so I was just getting ready for that. I was getting ready to retire. I need something to do too. And just so happened that my coach that at the time knew somebody else and do this, this other coach that had a female that was, uh, looking for a partner, also a double above the knee amputee. And so my boat classes, one guy, one girl. And so we met up, rode together, look like we were pretty good pair and once I retired, moved down to Florida, started training for the Paralympics. How long did you have to train? So I got out in late December, so say called January 1st and I, we had the Paralympic final September 2nd or September 3rd.

Speaker 3:          01:28:45       Okay, so you had a decent chunk of time, but yeah. Good. Nine months of crushing yourself.

Speaker 5:          01:28:51       Yeah. Train twice a day every day or twice a day. Six days a week. Take off Sunday and just sprints, you know, technique a lot. Technique. Uh, yeah. Do you have to do the technique in the water? Yeah. I mean you can do it outside of the water a little bit, but it's really, you got to practice your technique in, in the water. It's absurd. It's like Jujitsu, you just got to, it doesn't matter if you, if you're doing like in an a fake fake scenario you had, it doesn't really have the same effect unless you're doing it in the real thing. Yeah. So you get to England and boom. Yeah. How many races is there an England? Is it just one race? No, luckily there was a couple of races. So we had to do when the trials race, which was to find out who represented America.

Speaker 5:          01:29:41       Well, one that, and then we had to go qualify our boat for the Paralympics. And so we had to go to Serbia about, uh, maybe a month after winning the trials to qualify the boat. So we won that race, qualified our boat, and then Paralympics, you show up and you do your heat and then if you win that right, how many boats are in heat? A six. So there were 12 boats stole six in each eight, two heats. So if you win that heat, you automatically go to the final. If you don't win that, he, you got to go what's called the [inaudible] stands for second chance in French. And uh, you have to come first or second in that. So we want our episode, we lost our heat to the Chinese, which still makes me so mad. And, uh, we want our rapid shock. So we were in the final and we started the final and dead last and just slowly over the course of the race.

Speaker 5:          01:30:46       This was our race plan. We kind of wanted to start slow and build slowly. We just wrote in one boat and the next boat and the next boat until we got to the end. And we're about six. She, between us and the great British vote, the home team, everybody's cheering for the home team. And so third place gets a metal fourth place. You don't get anything. You got nothing. Yeah. So, and we're doing our final sprint and then we crossed the line and I don't know, I, I wasn't looking over there, my forearms were numb. I was just trying to hold onto the oars and then it comes up on this little board, you know, first place, China, second place friends, and then there's this, this long pause, look it over there. Then it goes third place USA. And I'm like, and you look at the video, it's literally like the length of one of these knives.

Speaker 5:          01:31:49       Yeah. That close point, 2.2 seconds between them and us. That's crazy. So close. So did you meet anyone while you draw on that event? Right. You're right. You're telling me you met, avoid over. I got it back. Oh, well, um, so I'll tell you when we were first got there and we were training, we were doing, we would go out, we were probably there a good week beforehand, so we'd go out and train on the lake and continue our training, get used to the area, my partner and my, my role and partner and I were watching the other teams. And then there's another boat class called the four. So it's four people. And I saw this great British for rode by and there was this gorgeous blonde in the bow of the four. And I said, I just bit my lip, like that's a good looking chick, Eh, you know, I didn't, I never expected to meet her or anything because you know, we're not racing against each other and she's from another team and you kind of, you know, until the race is over, you gotta be professional. Sure. She, even though she was super nice, she was very high, but you know, and she, she, uh, she'll tell me back when she told me what she saw me around, I was looking, because I was in, I was just in serious Marine Corps modes. Don't talk to him. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:33:29       And so, uh, racing's over, we're back in the athletes village. It's time to get after it. There's a casino outside the Athlete's village. So, uh, the American contingent goes out to this casino starts, we're part, I'm still at this point, I'm still kind of in like serious mode. It takes a couple of days to get out of it, you know, serious, serious mode, uh, still a little bit pissed that we lost to China and France. And it's like the two people, the two countries that my buddies were like, don't lose to China or France. They were taking shots like every two feet they were following on at home and they take the shot. They woke up so early in the morning. Um, so we're out there. Then the, the British team comes in for that. Just one gold. Right. And they're all, they're all happy. So we're the only two groups that speak English.

Speaker 5:          01:34:30       So, uh, yeah. So our two groups, you know, kind of end up together and it took, it took them a while to, uh, get me to out of my shell because I was like, you know, still kind of on my guard. I, yeah, this is the first, then maybe the second time I'd ever traveled outside of America for anything besides deployments. I had never traveled outside of America. Serbia was the first time England was the second time, so it was kind of still on my guard a little bit, but they started feeding me, fosters lightened up and then just so happened the, the gorgeous blonde I saw was there. So, hey, you guys know how charming I am. So charmed her, well, you at least fooled her.

Speaker 5:          01:35:18       I'm sure the alcohol helped, you know, but a charmed her and now we're married. So that's awesome. After four years of long distance relationship, because he kept rolling, she, she actually defended her a gold medal in Rio and did it again. Yeah. Got Gold again. So we did, we did about a, we didn't get together right away. We, we did a long distance for about three years. She live in England and I was living in America, but uh, finally got her over here. We're married. Yeah. Her name's Pam. Nice. Okay. Well obviously I have a certain affinity for British ladies as well. Pretty well known. Uh, now you mentioned real quickly you were training for triathlon in there somewhere too. Yeah. So the people at the clinic, it was a, I mean it was a team effort. Everybody, so,

Speaker 7:          01:36:09       okay.

Speaker 5:          01:36:10       They were other, other amputees in there. And I mean we talk about this a little bit yesterday. Dan Can Austin navy seal that was there for a year before me and Anne Paralympian as well? Yeah. Oh yeah. Paralympian to the biathlon. Um, he was my,

Speaker 5:          01:36:28       my idol I guess for when I first got there, cause he was pretty much done with therapy. He was about to get out. He was walking everywhere on his legs, Karina backpack around. And he was almost the exact same injuries. You just above the knee. Yeah. And so I could see him from when I was just sitting in a wheelchair. Right. All right. That is, it's possible. Yeah. Because I'm seeing it with my own two eyes. It is possible. And so, and he's a stud and yeah, if you want us to, if you want to try and be like anybody, it's be like damn. Cause Yeah. Um, and so that's kind of the, the environment that they had there at Walter Reed was you could ask somebody that had been there before, tips, tricks, anything like that. And so I saw Dan and I was asking him stuff and just watching how he did stuff.

Speaker 5:          01:37:23       And then eventually he left and I kind of noticed, you know, I am now, there's new guys coming in and I'm now that person that has been there. And so I need to step into that role and offer advice and work harder than anybody else in the clinic and show people what's going on and show people what's possible. And so the therapists would always be, hey, you want, who wants to run the army 10 miler? Who wants to do this triathlon? They'd always be getting offers. They ought to be getting slots in races because people love having wounded warriors out there. So they make a big deal. But they get let them go off first and everything. So yeah. So, and every time they asked me if I could, if I wasn't doing anything else that day, I'd be like, yeah, yeah, I'll do it. And so they're like, you want to do the nation's triathlon? It's a Olympic distance triathlon and there's like two people doing it and no other, it's like a single below the knee amputee doing it and that's it. And you're a double above knee amputee. You want to do it? Yeah, I do. And it just, so, cause it just so happened at the time I was learning how to ride a bicycle again, normal bicycle.

Speaker 4:          01:38:33       So you're learning how to ride a bike, might as well do a triathalon. Exactly. Hey, you got to give him, one of the things that's going to drive you

Speaker 5:          01:38:41       to push yourself is having skin in the game. Having something to lose. Having said that in a risk. So if you say to everybody in the clinic, I'm going to do the nation's triathlon and you don't do it, you're an idiot, you're a loser.

Speaker 4:          01:38:57       How long has the Olympic triathlon? Uh, Olympic

Speaker 5:          01:39:01       stents, the swim is 1500 meters. The bike is 40 kilometers and the run is 10 kilometers. Um, luckily for me, cause I wasn't not that good at swimming, luckily for me the swim got canceled that year because there was a huge storm as a ton of debris in the Potomac. So we didn't do the swim, but we did the bike and the run and yeah, so I was, I was relearning how to ride a bicycle. Nobody had ever done that before in the history of Walter Reed double above the knee amputee trying to ride a bicycle. And I had figured it out and I kind of wanted to put it to use, you know, like I finally figured this thing out. Um, and so, oh, what better way to do it then do the nation's triathlon. And so it was like, you know, baptism by fire in a way. And so it took me like four hours to do the whole thing. Okay. Did you enjoy it? I enjoyed having done it.

Speaker 4:          01:40:03       Okay. Cause I'm just wondering at what point you made the brilliant decision that you are going to ride a freaking bicycle across the United States of America. Well which was your next we'll whatever freaking psychotic idea you got again. Where'd that come from?

Speaker 5:          01:40:21       I had just learned how to ride the bike going. I got to do something with it. I can't make it just this pointless. I learned that okay I did it. No, never got to do it again. I was like, you know what might be fun. It's just like riding my bike across the country at some point in my life and this is what I have. I'm not even, I'm still in the hospital. I just learn how to ride the bike. I should do something like ride my bike across country, something like that, you know, some something cool like that. And I was rowing, I didn't do it right cause I, I had, I had made the, to do the rowing. Right. So it's, I'm going to do rowing, but eventually I will do this cross country bike ride. And so I did another year of rowing after that I, I took the time to kind of plan it out how I wanted to do it. And so it took another year of rowing and then finished world championships that year and forth. Um, and about a month later drove up to Maine, started riding. This is in October. And so what was that? What was that all uh, what was the, what did that day to day look like? Uh, so

Speaker 2:          01:41:31       okay,

Speaker 5:          01:41:31       I had a box truck or you haul box truck. I bought like a used 200,000 miles. You help box truck check my, I laid down some carpets in the back check, uh, had a couple of cots, couple of sleeping bags, supplies and my little brother who is about to turn 18 check, uh, rogered up to drive. Good to go. That's all you need right there. Box truck water, two cots carpet and a little brother. And so, you know, really trained much. What I did was I made sure that my prosthetics fit correctly and I was able to ride the bike. That's all I really did. I didn't, you know, go out and ride a hundred miles or anything, any kind of formal training for it. Yeah. Cause I figured what is the point. Yeah, exactly. Just start and the beginning is the training for the finish. Yeah. So

Speaker 5:          01:42:27       the day to day would be wake up probably six, seven o'clock, you know, drive out to wherever I was starting for the day cause he couldn't, you can't just like stop and then pull over. So we'd have to like drive the truck somewhere, park it in a church parking lot or a fire department parking lot and then uh, don't get apprehended by the cops. So the first time, so I had, I was right, I mean I'd be riding my bike and then my brother would be kind of half on half off the road. And I picked a route that we didn't have, you know, not super busy roads. So I wouldn't get in too many people's way until I got the Pacific coast highway. And then people were super pissed. And uh, at one point this cop, the for the first cop I encountered pulls over in front of us. I'm like, all right, here we go. He's going to tell me to stop the ride's over. And then he gets out and he's like, I just want to shake your hand, man. It was like, phew, okay, this is how it's going to go. This is so I'm going to get the cops love me. Um, and so I wake up, start riding probably around seven 38. I might eat breakfast beforehand. Um, probably ride.

Speaker 5:          01:43:42       Yeah, I would do 30 miles a day, so I'd just break that up however I felt for the day. Take breaks, hop in the back of the truck, sit around for a while and run. I'd ride 30 miles and then wherever I finished 30 miles, I might go a little bit further for a better spooling off point. Stop getting the truck drive off to wherever we might be able to park the truck and then spend the night in the truck and then a drive back out to that spot the next day. Do it again. Luckily for me, a lot of hotels started to offer us night's sleep. So we really on this sleep in the truck for the first month, and then after that we were mostly in hotels. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:44:25       And this was like a six month journey. Six months, October to October to April. So she did it through the winter time. Yeah. You ever heard of the polar vortex? No. No. What those pull their Fort Texas here, like this freezing temperatures that came down and attacked the nation with cold, they called him the polar vortex. It sounded very threatening. It's one step, one step higher than a shark. Nedo

Speaker 1:          01:44:54       uh, 5,000, 180 miles. Yeah. In the winter time. Every day for 180 days.

Speaker 2:          01:45:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:45:02       Um, talk about fortitude.

Speaker 2:          01:45:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:45:05       In your journal, and I'm going to read it. It was through, it was through the true purpose of the Marine Corps that I became what I am today. And it is that, it is that, and that is the act of fighting the battles of the United States. It is through the preparation for and the fighting of America's wars that marines gain. They're fine edge and an idea of the true meaning of courage, Spirit, tenacity, altruism and brotherhood. After having been imbued with the essential qualities ascribed to marines in bootcamp, it is up to the individual marine and his leadership all the way from the fire team leader to the commandant to make him the ideal tool for the core.

Speaker 2:          01:45:54       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:45:55       and there's no better place than a war to do this.

Speaker 2:          01:45:58       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:45:59       It was during my two deployments that I learned what it means to be courageous almost on a daily basis. My fellow marines and I would be subjected to situations with high potential for danger and situations with infinite unknowable, possible outcomes.

Speaker 2:          01:46:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:46:16       The dangerous and unpredictable nature of these conditions elicits fear, nervousness and uncertainty in all people.

Speaker 2:          01:46:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:46:24       However, without fail, when the time came to strap on our gear and proceed forth into these conditions, we did it with no hesitation because it was what we needed to do.

Speaker 2:          01:46:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:46:40       To me, that is courage. I learned it from the example set by my leaders and my compatriots and when it was my turn, I endeavored to teach others by my own example.

Speaker 2:          01:46:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:46:55       My favorite among the many mantras of the Marine Corps is adapt and overcome. It is my favorite because it embodies the spirit and tenacity that marines must possess in order to be the world's greatest war fighting force two marines. Accomplishment of their mission is of the utmost importance above that of their own lives and the ability to adapt and overcome is key.

Speaker 2:          01:47:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:47:24       The idea is straight forward change whatever you need to in order to become what is required to transcend an obstacle. If there is no bridge over a river, a marine will swim.

Speaker 2:          01:47:40       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:47:40       If there was a wall in front of us, we will blow it apart. If there was an enemy on a hill that we want, we will remove him. Marines do not stop until they have accomplished their mission, regardless of any monkey wrench that gets thrown into their plan, they will change their plane plan a thousand times if it need be until what needs to be done is done, and then they will move on to the next mission. It was these two qualities that kept me, that allowed me to keep fighting after hours wounded.

Speaker 2:          01:48:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:48:17       My plan of accomplishing something with my life and making my life as good as possible was met with obstacles and monkey wrenches.

Speaker 2:          01:48:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:48:26       But since I had already learned these lessons, bypassing these obstacles and moving on was easy and natural,

Speaker 2:          01:48:36       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:48:37       The Brotherhood that they're marines share is the defining feature that initially attracted me to the Marine Corps and over the course of two deployments, I experienced it to its fullness. The reason that I was able to be courageous and adapt and overcome was because of the men that stood beside me doing the same thing and is because we were experiencing war and hardship together that we goo grew close enough that I cared for them more than I cared for myself and which sacrifice my safety for their wellbeing even if it meant being extinguished and although it never needed to be said, I knew this was reciprocated.

Speaker 2:          01:49:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:49:25       To me, this is the definition of brotherhood and selflessness.

Speaker 2:          01:49:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:49:31       And from my having been part of such a relationship is why I am loyal and put others before myself as if it were a default setting. Without the Marine Corp,

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       I have no idea where I would be or what I would be like. All I can say for sure is that I am what I am now due in large part to what I was taught and what I experienced during my five years in the Marine Corps. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:50:15       Yeah. Awesome. If there's anything that the Marine Corp teaches you, it is brotherhood. It is endurance. How to endure

Speaker 5:          01:50:32       situations. You don't want to have to be, uh, whether it's humping around with a pack or fighting in Afghanistan, Iraq, or if it's sitting in the back of a seven ton and getting drenched in rain and then having to set up a tent, blah, blah, blah. It teaches you those things. And so I already knew all this stuff. I was good at it by the time I became an amputee. And then I got even better at it once I was an amputee, even more experience. And then, so that led into being able to endure whatever I had to for the bike ride. And I think the slogan slogan for the wounded warrior regimen in the Marine Corps is, I don't know if this is, it's Latin, I don't know if it's, I'm pronouncing it right. It's [inaudible] and [inaudible], which is still in the fight. And you know, I'm not still in the main fight that's going on in Iraq or Afghanistan. I've been taken out of that fight, but the overall fight, I'm still in that. I'm still a representative of America. I'm still representative of marines. I'm dedicating myself to help my brothers that are struggling or come back wounded. I'm still in that portion of the fight. And I mean, just remember, you just have to remember that that slogan to stay, stay in the fight, just keep fighting

Speaker 1:          01:52:13       are obviously you're staying in the fight. And I, I, I again, reading through your journal stuff is awesome and there's a bunch of different things that I wanted to pull out and obviously I can't read the whole damn thing, right? Maybe I could, but I'll leave that for you. Uh, but one of the things, you know, I'm always thinking that what, you know, what can I pull out that I think will be really helpful to other people. And I thought that this thing that you wrote right here was just something that can be used by, by anybody, especially people that are facing tough situations, which as you just mentioned, you are pretty Dang good at dealing with tough situations. And I think this gives a little insight into that. So here we go back to your journal. The Kubler Ross model explains the stages by which an individual grieves for a lost intimate. The five stages are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. In this case, it could be said, I was grieving for myself, the former me that had died in Sangin.

Speaker 2:          01:53:24       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:53:25       Since I had a natural understanding of conservation of energy and an awareness of the time required to reach my goal, I instinctively skipped the first four steps and proceeded the acceptance portion of the process. I had decided that to spend my limited energy resources on denial, anger, bargaining, and depression would be a pointless waste and would be better left off of my itinerary.

Speaker 2:          01:53:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:53:54       I want her to be able to expand as much energy as I could toward my goal, which would not only allow me to reach it faster, but would improve the quality of my success.

Speaker 2:          01:54:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:54:05       The sooner I had accepted my situation, the sooner I could get to where I want it to be. Having one's legs amputated above the knee is categorically a negative experience. If I hadn't had the right mindset afterward, the rest rest of my life could have also become a negative experience. Fortunately, I was able to react to the loss by accepting the negative energy from that occurrence and using it to open doors for myself in order to be sure that my life would remain a positive experience.

Speaker 2:          01:54:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:54:45       No matter who you are, whether you are healthy or ill injured or able bodied, everyone's main purpose in life is to make it as good as possible. This is an unchanging objective for all people. No matter what happens. Thus, now that I was a double above the knee amputee, I needed to figure out a way to keep my life enjoyable. With this in mind, I researched the Paralympics to see if I could participate, which led to a bronze medal at the 2012 games. Not only that, I accepted people into my life who have enriched it beyond what I could've imagined from the experiences associated with sports. I've learned lessons that have and will continue to make me a better person. Lessons that I can pass on to others in the future. It was in this way that I was able to transform the negative experience of having lost the lower part of my legs into the positive experience in energy of participating in a sport and all that has accompanied it.

Speaker 2:          01:55:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:55:53       If you are ill or injured, use it as a way to discover a new hobby or career. If someone is rude to you and makes you angry.

Speaker 2:          01:56:05       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:56:05       use the anger to fuel a workout. If someone you know has a terminal illness, use it as an opportunity to make a difference in their life and in the world. The most important part of transforming energy from negative to positive is being aware of opportunities as they are presented and having the courage to seize them. Energy is all around us. Constantly fueling and transforming. It will affect us in ways we cannot beat per, we cannot predict be a person that uses energy intelligently.

Speaker 2:          01:56:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:56:47       Instead of wasting it.

Speaker 5:          01:56:53       I like to say you use the weight and I kind of analogize it. I like to lift weights. Sure. You guys can probably tell, I like to analogize it with maybe like a strict press. So the weight on the bar, his whatever girlfriend broke up with you, whatever possible issue you're having. And you can hold that bar on your shoulders and you can just leave it there and eventually start to hurt. And then eventually if you leave it there long enough, you'll just be on the ground with that weight on your chest. You can't move anymore. Or when you have that weight on the bar and it's on your shoulders, your shoulder, press it

Speaker 5:          01:57:41       and then do it again. You'd do it again and again. And then you let your body adapt and next time you try and lift that weight, it's nothing you can do that wait easily, I can handle that, no problem. And then you can handle even more weight. And then when you get good at that, you seek out the weight. You purposefully try and make things harder for yourself so that you can just become even stronger and even stronger. And you embrace that and you start to enjoy it a little bit. And so, I mean, I think that's what I was trying to say there.

Speaker 1:          01:58:21       I think you said it. Not only did you say it, but, uh, you actually are living that currently at this time seeking out more.

Speaker 5:          01:58:34       Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:58:35       I guess maybe I would even go so far as to say stupid things to do. So the next

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       challenge that you put in front of yourself is the thing that you're about to do right now. And I've never heard of a challenge like this before, but you're going to do a month of marathons.

Speaker 5:          01:58:52       Yeah. So these things are only stupid or crazy

Speaker 4:          01:58:59       rides. Not Crazy because I did it.

Speaker 5:          01:59:02       If I had failed, then people could say it's crazy, so I failed this one, then it's stupid. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:59:07       Nah, man, I'll tell you why did you, you going out there and making these things happen. You know, it's, it's awesome whether you finish or not. Well, no matter what you do, the fact that you're putting these hardcore challenges in front of yourself is, it's unbelievable. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:59:23       So, yeah, all this stuff that I've written down, what we've talked about, all the wisdom I've been able to, to gain through my injury and through being in the Marine Corps. I think this the month of marathons I'm about to do this and everything else that I, that I try and do. I'm trying to be an example because there's so many people out there. When I was trying to learn to ride the bike again, I didn't know anybody that had ever done it before until I saw somebody that had done it and it just made everything. Once you realize it's possible, it makes it so much easier because you know it's, it can be done. And so I want to be an example for people to look at and they see me and they say, well, they might not be trying to run 31 marathons in 31 days and 31 different cities or ride their bike across the country.

Speaker 5:          02:00:21       But they can say there's a double above knee amputee that ran 31 marathons in 31 days. I can probably go walk on the treadmill. So if I just want to be an example of that and I want to be an example of all of these lessons that I've learned, a person that uses the weight instead of lets it destroy their life, somebody that stays in the fight keeps fighting no matter what. That's what I'm trying to do. I want to serve to show people what they can do and especially, you know, wounded veterans and people that might be struggling with what they saw. And you know, I'm lucky enough that my mind is clear. I had a great three concussion. That's it. No traumatic brain injury, no post traumatic stress, nothing like that. And so I want to show civilians and veterans like that it is possible to have a traumatic experience and come through and be fine and not have, not have to suffer from post traumatic stress that just overwhelms you.

Speaker 5:          02:01:35       Um, cause I think in society these days it's almost becoming expected that you're going to go to war and you're going to come back. And so a lot of people might end up just being a wall. I'm supposed to have post traumatic stress. So I'm going to manifest it in myself or they let it get worse or they don't, they don't fight it. They just let it happen. And so I want to be an example of somebody that uses their experience and it's just goes and has this terrible experience and you know, don't make a big deal about it.

Speaker 4:          02:02:15       And part of you doing that is running 31 freaking marathons in 31 days. Yep. So when do you start a, so I'm going to start in 31 different cities, different cities,

Speaker 5:          02:02:28       first city, London, a London on October 12th and then I'm going to fly to Philadelphia. So basically the way it's going to work, I'll run in the city, probably take about the whole thing. I'll take breaks during the, during the run. So probably the whole thing will probably take five and a half, six hours to do. I'll, I'll do the run on my own just like in a park or on a trail out and backs, loops. I'll do it on a 400 meter track if I have to, um, do that, getting my RV drive to the next place, spend the night there.

Speaker 4:          02:03:10       We upgraded from a box truck with the clots in the back. Well the wife's going to be coming along so she wasn't going to get all going to have a crew for this.

Speaker 5:          02:03:19       So when I got my wife, Pam is gonna be my team leader. She's just doing so much stuff. She's a team leader or the everything, every job that you could possibly think of. She's doing it and my mom is coming cause he a massage therapist and she's going to give him a saws and I'm going to have a driver, not my brother this time I think I blew him out. That was the first time of I'm been to have a driver and so we're going to all hop in the RV drive too. So from Philadelphia to New York, run in New York, repeat until I go all the way around. I'm going to end November 11th veteran's day DC on the National Mall.

Speaker 4:          02:03:59       And, and your goal obviously is to show people and lead people and to set an amazing example. And on top of that you're going to earn, you're going to, you're going to earn money for some real specific charities that, that you believe in and stand behind. And what are those charities?

Speaker 5:          02:04:18       Yeah, so my goal, my main goal is obviously the to be the example and all these kind of grand uh, objectives. But you know, how do you really, you can't quantify that really. So the way that I'm quantifying it is I'm going to be raising money for three veterans charities that I've had personal contact with that have helped me during my recovery. Um, and they are the semper fi fund, the tunnel to towers foundation and the coalition to salute America's heroes. And so that's how I'm going to be. That's also, I'm going to be showing veterans that America loves them because that is something that's been made abundantly clear to me. Everywhere I go. Like all the time, I think I did three breakfasts in a row where somebody paid for it anonymously. I get thanked all the time. And so if they're saying that stuff to me, it's obvious that they love all veterans and I'm trying to help connect that does reduce that gap between the military and the civilian worlds and get them to, to talk and, and show that show veterans that they're coming back to a country that appreciates them and loves them more than pretty much any other thing.

Speaker 5:          02:05:40       And so I think by the donations and by having people come out and run with me and show me support, then that kind of helps us to prove that to people.

Speaker 4:          02:05:52       So where can we go donate? What's the, what's the link? Rob Jones, journey.com Rob Jones, journey.com

Speaker 5:          02:06:00       there's a, there's a donate link there and you can also see my schedule there and I'll have details of where I'm going to be.

Speaker 4:          02:06:09       It's the whole country. It's east coast, west coast, Yep. Middle of the country, all the way around. You can drive in a day to get to the next spot, to run 26.2 miles.

Speaker 5:          02:06:17       My longest drive this 1214 hours. And that happens maybe once or twice. So it's they're all pretty close to each other and major cities and yeah, you can go to my website, Rob Jones, journey.com donate there, see my schedule Rsvp that you're going to show up. You don't have to if you, but if you want to that's cool. I'll have all the details there and then social media's all at Rob Jones journey.

Speaker 4:          02:06:43       Awesome. I,

Speaker 7:          02:06:47       yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:06:47       it's awesome man. It's just awesome and you're freaking awesome. And I grabbed a couple this a little short piece from your journal. Again, this is something that I just thought is, is just going to be helpful to me when I read it and will be helpful to anybody that that listens, hears or reads this and here we go. Back to your journal. The conscious is in control of forming habits. Every time we are faced with the decision of whether to quit, slowed down and rationalize a reason why that's okay or keep pressing forward, one of those habits is strengthened. The more times we choose

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       to push on, the stronger that habit will become. It takes time and purposeful effort for these habits to become ingrained. But once a person develops them in the gym, doing something as simple as choosing to keep rowing hard for another minute, they can apply what they have learned to the rest of their lives.

Speaker 2:          02:08:03       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:08:03       They will learn to take the harder path so that they are challenged more. They will learn to put extra effort into daily tasks. Who you are depends entirely on your influences and the level of effort that is put into forging yourself into what you desire to be.

Speaker 5:          02:08:39       And that's awesome. Yeah. I mean, every, every decision you make either gets you closer to your goal or moves you further away. And I'm not saying I'd never make the decisions that movie to the left, maybe further away. I'm human just like everybody else.

Speaker 1:          02:08:56       Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah. You know, we were hanging out yesterday and I was like, I was busy. I was like, Hey man, I've got to go. So in that buisiness you know what I had for dinner last night, Mrs? No, I did have Mras that's not happening. Okay. No. My entire dinner was a leftover piece of a Caesar Salad and a giant mint chocolate chip milkshake. I actually said, my wife is like make me, cause I was working and I did. You know, you can't stop and eat when you're trying to work and so I just said, can you make me just a giant mint chocolate chip milkshake now? I didn't get closer to my, you know, physical goals. No, but I got a lot of work done. Yeah, I got an extra whatever, 28 minutes worth of work though because I didn't stop to eat dinner. Yeah, yeah. You got to take the wins with the losses. I dig it,

Speaker 5:          02:09:49       Isabelle. You know, making that, it's like you plot your progress on a graph and you're going to have as long it's going to go up and it's going to go down a little bit, then it's going to go up and it's going to be down. So as long as that trend is upward, then you know you can relate to, have nothing to worry about. But if that thing starts to level off and then go the other way, then you need to ask yourself some questions and you need to give yourself some honest answers.

Speaker 1:          02:10:16       Yeah. You know, we had a conversation not too long ago, a guy asked about Jujitsu belts and said, you know, I understand that you shouldn't pursue cause in Jiu Jitsu it's like, hey, you shouldn't just like go to get a belt. Uh, you go cause you want to get better and you want to learn. And, and he said,

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       you know, I understand that you shouldn't just do it to get the belt,

Speaker 5:          02:10:37       but

Speaker 4:          02:10:38       it's good to mark your progress and figure your progress out. And I was it. And that's true. And that's what you're saying like, yeah. And I've talked about that too. Um, you know, I related to shooting where when you, when you focus on the target, your, your vision gets blurry and so you lose track of the long term, the long term goal or the long range target. So that's why we focused on our front site because we can keep that little thing that's right in front three feet in front of us on our rifle. You can keep that in focus. So that's what you focus on. And every once in a while if you start that, maybe that gets a little blurry. Well then you look at your longterm targeting cause the, that daily grind will beat you down too. And if you just lift the daily grind, the daily grind, the daily grind beating you down, and then you, you, you forget what your goal was in the first place. But so every once in a while, yeah, you've got to look up at your longterm goal and say, I want to be doing this or achieve that or whatever. I want to do 31 marathons. See some people would have picked like February, right? We'll do 28 marathons. You're, you're going to the full 31. Uh, that's the difference right there.

Speaker 5:          02:11:46       If I want to make it, if I want to make these points, that's why I rode my bike from Maine to southern California. I was sitting there going, yeah, I could, I could ride Florida to San Diego. It would be technically be all the way across, but technically, but there'd be that. But I don't want any buts associated with anything that I do. I don't want anybody to have any reason to say, Oh yeah, Rob Jones, he ran 31 marathons in 31 days,

Speaker 4:          02:12:18       not 32. Did you got to do a good job on, on your social media when you're, when you go out on this thing, you got to document this thing and post it so people can like,

Speaker 5:          02:12:26       I'm hoping so I'm working with a sports illustrated. I think they're going to do a video. I heard of them. Um, yeah, good outlet. Do they do good videos? That's to discriminating judge of videos. Right. So yeah, I plan like, you know, I documented the a bike ride that's documentaries on my website too. So yeah, I do try and document these things and uh, just in case people don't happen to catch it while I'm doing it, they can go back and use that as their example for, for what I've done. And they can find out that way. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:13:04       Well I know you get stuff done and you hammer out your daily tasks. We're going to let echo hammer out his baby task right now. Technically we porch time, we can task. I do, I extra respect on the weightlifting analogy. I think like weight lifting and exercising in general, like Chris is like the perfect analogy for those things. You know, cause it's like, yeah, I mean I could into it, but yeah, it was good. But that, that is an APP, that outstanding analogy like, hey that waits on you. You're either going to use it to get better or are you going to let it bare you in the ground? Yeah. The choice is yours. What are you going to do?

Speaker 8:          02:13:45       Yeah. And like, and it goes to show, we talk about this sometimes where you can take let's say a random person, right? And you'd be like, Hey, let's go to the gym. And there, there can be literally opposite reactions if you get two different people. So one guy, you can be like, hell yeah, let's go to the gym. I'm going to work out. And it gets dry, need to get in shape. Good. You know, it's this thing. Or he can get someone to be like, that's the worst thing in the world. I don't want to go to the gym. I don't like, that's hard and it hurts the next day it hurts, you know? So meanwhile it's the same exact activity by the way, you know? So you can look at in those two different ways,

Speaker 4:          02:14:20       you know, what else is messed up is there's activities that are also good for you and move you in a direction that you want to be moving. But maybe like, let's say the got, you can, we can give you a real good example. You take a meat head, right? And you go, okay, you want to go to the gym? What does the meat head say? Yes, let's go get it. But then you say to that same guy who seems all motivated and fired up to improve himself. Yeah. And you say, Hey, let's go read a book and try and understand better this concept of whatever and what did they say? Then they go to the gym. So it's interesting. Yeah. The weight, the weight isn't necessarily just a physical weight, it's pressing up against whatever it is that's going to improve you and you can either use it to beat you down or you can use it to make yourself better.

Speaker 8:          02:15:20       Yeah. And again, just as a concept, right? I think the exercise and weightlifting and like your body just kind of figuratively can demonstrate just so much, you know, that'll place so much

Speaker 4:          02:15:33       and you especially feel that way about curls. Is that what I'm hearing? Depends on the thing, but yeah, generally.

Speaker 8:          02:15:40       Anyway, speaking of curls, which should I go into this? No.

Speaker 4:          02:15:48       Your daily tasks. Weekly tasks, yeah. Yeah. Might as well. Well, Rob Jones here to listen so, and then wait to hear the support, the support you get to witness the supports live honor. So Watch, watch echo, do his work. His life's work. His life's work right here. Support. You have to do this. We can go to my house and you watch me edit a video. So, so dope. You know?

Speaker 8:          02:16:14       Anyway. Made in America or Gin, that's the company or didn't main.com you started in Maine. Yeah. By credit cross city. Yeah. That's where this place is. We just got back what last week? Yeah. We can ask whatever. Yeah, that's a cool spot. You know he has a side note. He is like this I think is on like the history channel or something like that where it was kind of like a show and you know the story you told about getting, he got this, the loom right where he got to actually make right, right. They came and filmed some stuff but they can produce it. Yeah. He showed it to me but it was great because when he's telling the story I'm like man that took you took like eight hours or something or more than two. More than that. Yeah. I like to get it and it's this big thing and it kind of showed it.

Speaker 8:          02:16:57       They were there for that bill moving the looms. Loomis and me neither and that he asked me, he's like, you know what illumines I was like loom. I've heard that like Warren was familiar fruit of the loom. Right? Yeah. And when you think about it, it makes sense because fruit of the loom is like, right. It's the fabric, you know, it has all the strings, right? Yeah, yeah. It makes fabric anyway. So when they say made in America, in this case it's for real made in America. They get to cotton from America, they make it with a loom in America. This guy p Roberts up in origin, which were in league now with origin, but we went up into old mills cause all the mills up there, a lot of them shut down. And actually I think all of them shut down. And these were, these were, these were factories that were like half a million square feet and they were filled with looms and filled with production and filled with a war.

Speaker 8:          02:17:55       American workers. And it all went overseas and he went in and literally bought Allume. Um, for that, I think that, I think it was like $3,000, the cost of the scrap metal that it was worth and anyways, took it, hired some old timers that new, still knew how to work. It brought them back to work and then started making clothes. Well making Jujitsu gies where he started with but, but you know, got everything being lined up to get made. And that loom, they only had that one because they're going to put in a museum or something. Yeah. They were literally going to take that one loom that they had left and they're going to make it a museum over on it

Speaker 5:          02:18:37       some because there are so many people out there now that they're like, oh our country has to make problems, our country has to may problems. We need to do this, we need to do that. And are they say somebody is to do this, somebody needs to. And it's like, Hey, yeah, why want you and here's the guy that's doing that.

Speaker 8:          02:18:55       No, it's all guess what bull. Yeah. Yeah. And it's interesting too when we went there, you can tell he's into it. He's like, he were driving up there, he's talking about how yarn is all made and stuff. And he's like, Hey, I got, I got to calm down because I'm getting to, I need to say he's into it. Cause he went out and bought a broken rusty Lubrin, refurbished it and moved it into a factory that he built on his own property. It's ridiculous. And it shows to the gies like you might do Jujitsu right today. Piggies are like, they're cool, you know, martial arts, Giza, whatever. But he brings like this added like element to it because it's specifically designed for, yeah, for Jujitsu. That's not the kind where it's like, Hey, let me get a g blank from overseas or whatever and then like embroider my logo on it.

Speaker 8:          02:19:41       So it's kind of like the same thing. You don't, you don't have much innovation freedom with a physical product. He does though. So it's like I took all his role and the other day GE, whenever I take off the top and you'd left with just the pants. So the pants are like, they're by, um, like sizes. You know you wear a 36 are in regular stuff is just the like numbers a one, a two, a three, four, five, six. This is like fitted to you. Right. So I'm wearing the pants and they feel kind of like normal pants and I was Greg in one. They're like, they were noticing.

Speaker 8:          02:20:16       You always don't mind getting choked out by [inaudible]. So sweet. Here's the thing. My streak everyday and I wear it everyday. I've to two tops. I wear it every day and the streak is still alive every single time someone asks like what up the key and they call, let me see, let me see. Yeah, they're dope. Fabric is woven is legit. This is legit. Yeah. And see these shorts I have on right now, I should, I kind of in a way, should it mention these cars be sticking out. We're not making those shorts because they don't make these shorts. I've worn these three days in a row by the way. Oh, nice. That smell was whatever. I watched the ones, but yeah, they're my favorite shorts. They're made out of the same material as one of the one of the keys. Yeah, that looks nice. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          02:20:56       I spilled some eggs on it. You know, it leaves them, these shorts are black by, so you know how you, when you spill eggs or out of nausea feed my son yogurt and stuff and it's built on it. So you just take a brush like you know like a brush you find under your sink or whatever. Put some water and I scrubbed it. You can't do that on like your shorts, cattle start to wear it out, you know. But it gets tough. It's supposed to be tough. Did it? You'd have to wash it anyway. I can't get the shorts. I don't get robbed and fire it up. We'll make it, we'll make them. Yeah. So stand by for that nonetheless. Do ciggies all kinds of the rash guards and even like, like regular clothes, shirts, hoodies and whatnot. The joggers acute putting on the joggers and walking around in front of my wife, she likes it.

Speaker 8:          02:21:39       That was a weird thing cause I didn't actually know what, do you know what joggers are there? New joggers, you know, they're like, there are like, what's a passion thing? No sweat pants, but they're somehow more high end. Yeah, the shape is different. They kind of taper down your leg. Like, you know, I like skinny jeans and said I'm going to go ahead and say I don't endorse that product. Neither did I, but I put them on and I was like, I was like these, I don't know how I look because they didn't have a mirror in the cabin except in the bathroom. But nonetheless, um, so I couldn't see how they look. They look kind of strange from up here, but I don't know. So I was like, Eh, whatever origin he wore, the origin jogger pants and the matching origin, the sweatshirt or Hoodie.

Speaker 8:          02:22:27       And he went, he rolled out like that. Like it was like, it was the deal and he looked, he was a straight up leisure suit is what it is. Rolling up, not playing around. And then when I came in I thought people would be like, oh, you know you don't match in that cause I'm not used to wearing but B if that I that I looked good in it and then my wife said I looked good in it. Oh that one Pete made it. Of course he was a moment of honesty because he mentioned either you, I don't, I think it was you or someone. He was like, I don't think just Jocko could pull it off or something like that. No, it might've been someone else. I don't think he was talking about he's right. He's away. Pull it off. Whatever coes design for what I did notice though, not happening there.

Speaker 8:          02:23:16       I'm maybe I'm not secure in my man had no, I just know for girls clothes, rarely, not nonetheless. Functionally. That is what I noticed right when I put them on though, like when you roll out, you know how like if you have, and not that it's even a big deal. Even me talking about things like you know how it is when like something happens. But actually when you wearing skinny jeans, I actually have no idea what he's talking about. But I roll with it cause we're trying to condense the timeline of the supports. Speech speaking, which is hard in the spirit of accuracy. I'm going to go down this whole, you know, when you were, have you ever worn sweat pants ever in your life? Not really. Kind of sweatpants. Okay. Rob Jones. I have warrants pre-injury IIF. Yeah. So consider this. When you, let's say like, I don't know, you're running or walking or whatever.

Speaker 8:          02:24:03       He's like the sweatpants or you loose. They flow. Not a big deal. I dig it. I understand. But the skinny jeans, sweatpants, joggers, I, we shouldn't even say skinny jeans are going to get this off my podcast now they function cause they don't flap around and they're like, if you're running with them, they work. I'm just finally shorts. Right for that very reason. It's three feet of snow. I just run in short. It nonetheless built, knock it till you try it all. So Jocko, some supplements, I don't know if you knew this, Rob Jones, but super krill oil available now available boom, or domain.com or [inaudible] the top labs labs on the top of the menu. What do you call it? The top menu on the website labs. Super Krill joint warfare. That's a big one. I mean we know Krill is like the base, the joint warfare.

Speaker 8:          02:25:03       Yeah. So good. And the significance. Well layers if you will. I think, you know, maybe that's a stretch with layers, but this is the, the stuff that you've been taking from jump as with some bonus bonus stuff, bonus stuff that I now can take in one shot. So like when you're even before this podcast and stuff, you're like taking glucosamine and Krill oil and all this stuff and you're like, you know what would be make this even better. It's like, you know, those little elements or whatever. And one day, you know, I'm going to make my own and boom, it happened kind of. Yeah. So we're in it. A joint warfare. That's a good one. A Super Krill. Describe it has an added thing right in the Super Krill oil and it's like Super Krill. Yeah, yeah. Oh that's it. Super Supergirl. Dope Krill. Okay. What else is going to add?

Speaker 8:          02:25:52       It's already super duper duper. That'll be super duper all calling us. He now he's going to take the market from us. Rob Jones, super duper Krill oil to just pat it. Well he does make things have just gotten the website and that Twitter handle the domain. It's true. Uh, but yeah, so basically everything you need for the joint situation, you're covered. And then what about that pre work? A preadmission preadmission pre pre workout. It's not available yet. It will be coming soon. It's, we're not going to talk about that one. We'll talk about it. We are, it is, is in the testing phase and has been being tested and legit so far. So good. Boom. I'm kind of addicted to it. Yep. Also on it.com/jocko. Okay. So I get all my kettle bells from on. I got into kettle bells after this podcast kind of started.

Speaker 8:          02:26:53       And you know, ana has awesome stuff. Specifically the kettlebells because they're the designer. Once you seen that guy before it. So I get the whole set. Well I don't have the whole set. Technically I have the weights that I think I'm going to be able to use. What's your heaviest one you have at home? Uh, 40 kilograms. So what does that 80, 80, 88 pounds. That's cool man. Cool story. I got the 90 pound one, so whatever. So basically all 88 pounds that you have. I have that plus more and more. No big deal. All right, there you go. Go ahead. And you wear skinny jeans, skinny joggers, contemporary joggers from time to time tracks at least four pounds kettlebell. It, it functionally it, it adds it by the way, got the gorilla ones a few weeks ago. Um, the 90 pound one is the big foot, just for informational purposes ever.

Speaker 8:          02:27:52       Gonna make a hundred pound Jocko head. Actually, they said that people have been saying there's been some, there's been some requests if anyone would actually want that. I saw, I saw a guy sent me a two. It was a 200 5,200 something pound kettle bell. Dang. I don't even know what I mean. Yeah, I guess. Right? Goals. That's a legit, there's like, you know, some people are just mute and strong. One of my team Guy Buddies, just mute and strong. I ain't Jiu Jitsu. Great Dude, but he got the beast. I don't know who makes it, but there's a kettlebell called the beast. I think it's like 102 pounds or something, but there was like this little test taming the beast and he got the kettle bell out of the box. Did the test passed it? I was like, I mean things that I couldn't do at all. I was like, okay, you're legit. Kettlebells are crazy. Yeah. Actually it's cool. That's like one of those exercises that you, if you learn that the form, it's like an added element because you've got to learn the form. Then the strength and the learning, the form is good for you because you're developing.

Speaker 2:          02:29:02       Okay.

Speaker 8:          02:29:03       You're developing a neuro muscular connections. Yes. Boom. Thank you. Amen. You know, it was lost for words and you've had me covering move. No problem. I got you. But yeah, so you need, it's basically you have to learn to balance something that's not balanced. Yeah know it's good. Like that bag I lifted in Maine, these guys, it'd be left. That's good. 200 pounds by the way. No worries. You know, it's super hard. I feel the first time also they got what? Jump ropes. Macy's, you know, if your workout gets boring, jacket doesn't have that problem. We know. We know because you just won't care here to win and all this stuff. But some people they get bored, you know, with a workout, you get all this cool stuff anyway. A on it.com/ chocolate's a good one. Also, when you buy these extra, I'll put a link to your journal if you don't mind.

Speaker 8:          02:29:50       Yeah. But yeah, it was nothing to buy. It's free. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But if you know, you go on there, I'll put in the book section and Oh, that'd be awesome if, yeah, man, it's good. And if you, if people want to get some of the other books that Jocko talks about, you go to our website.podcast.com books from podcast that's on the top menu. And then you click through there to get your books, takes you to Amazon, boom, click through there. Or if you do any other shopping, boom, click through. That's good way to support small action. Big Reaction.

Speaker 8:          02:30:23       It is a legit way to support for sure it is. I'd be, I got to ask that two times now. Yeah. Once in Maine and I think I was at an event the other day, uh, and someone asked me, he does it really help and I was like, yes it is. Yeah, it, I, I said it's exactly what echo says it is. Yup. Small. Actually it takes what, like three extra seconds. Yeah. Small action. Boom. One, two clicks, whatever. And you, big support. Big Reaction. Also subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already. I know. Seems kind of obvious, right? Itunes, subscribe. But if you haven't subscribed or stitcher or Google play, yeah. Anything that provides platforms just subscribed. Good way to support. Easy, you know, boom. Also Youtube Channel. We have a youtube channel I put was the last video. I put it on there.

Speaker 8:          02:31:13       The book video. Oh yeah. Freedom fuel manual. Vdl Awesome job on that by the way. We're both. Thank you. Very cool. Pretty good video. I thought it was pretty good too. I felt Jocko did all the work really lifting. That was a hard night too. I mean you were lifting after like a whole day. I was like Bro, I'm not like a long day, long day. You know him. He's the kind of where I'm like okay, I just need like the shots, you know, cause we're doing it for like other stuff and I'm going to grab the steels and whatever and I was like, I just need the shots. What I'll do is I'll make it here so you don't have to put on all that weight. And he's like, no, I'll feel like plus if I don't put the weights. I was like, Bro, you're the man. Same exact thing.

Speaker 8:          02:31:52       I was just shooting a video doing lifting weights and they're like, yeah, we're just going to do it with no way. I'm like, no, but kill the video that I want. The weight that I want to be on there is 135 pounds. I want that to be on video. I don't want no wait to be on video. He even went one further that there was a few shots that I was getting that didn't show how much weight. It just showed the front of the, you know, it was like an angle you could kind of see part of the way. Kind of. He's like, no. He's like, he wouldn't allow him, so you know, I took the Rob Jones approach. I was like, okay, I've got to move somewhere it around. I'm going to use the opportunity to make myself better. I out. I was getting after it.

Speaker 8:          02:32:28       He's a method actor. That's exactly right. Yeah. Hey, it worked out for him and I dig it, but yeah, nonetheless, back to youtube. Boom. We put some videos on there including, but not limited to the video version of this podcast. Also additional videos, excerpts and various other videos, deleted scenes if you will. A lot of times we talk rubbish before we actually include, you know, or we don't include in the podcast. Um, so sometimes we'll cut that up and put it on there too to add in entertainment. You know, here Jocko swear a lot. You know, he doesn't swear that much on on, on the record, but you know, he gets after it from time to time. Also myth on the hanging out with like one of my bros.

Speaker 8:          02:33:17       Effin just effing get nuts with F in squats and your effing thing. He was like, yeah, he like over did it nonetheless. Yeah, youtube, that's a good one. Um, also Jocko has a store, if you didn't already know, guess what it's called. I want to go on a limb. Say Jocko store the store. It's that Jocko store.com. We've got some t shirts on there. They're cool. They're cool. You know, some layers on those t shirts, layers meaning not physical layers. Uh, what do you call it? Poetic layers. Poetics that's really reaching. It's reaching a lot of good. It's pretty poetic. Is that one myself. You know what the layers are with that though, right? If you look at the good shirt it has jock was head. That's good, right? But the good is backwards. And here's the thing. That's why when people try to counterfeit that one, they don't, they don't get the layers.

Speaker 8:          02:34:10       They just see jungle shaded old little old. That's a marketing thing or whatever and let's sell that. But they don't get it. They don't know the layers. The good is backwards. It's backwards for a reason. That better write it in the mirror. Cause who are you saying that when you hear that? Who are you saying that too? You're not saying you know to your poor daughter who's crying cause she skinned her knee. You don't say good. She's like, oh she cries more. That's not her main. It's not your missing message to give somebody else your message to give to yourself and your daughter cry in the first place. Well, she's sensitive. I'm cultivating her sensitive site. That's all. You're not wearing a tee shirt for yourself to look down like that. We're in it so other people can read it. You can read it in a typical case, but not these teachers.

Speaker 8:          02:34:52       That tee shirt is for you. Create a, for you with the message with Jacqueline's face. Apparently that's free to, not for everybody, but this is for you. And unless that's just an example of the layers on the shirts, Jocko stark.com. There's also some hoodies on there, some travel mugs, bumper, bumper stickers. The Jocko 2016 I took it off. We lost that election. Yeah, you did. Sorry, I got like 27 votes. Yeah, I got some legit votes. People posted them on Twitter. Some people wrote me in straight up. I did. You know what? I don't want Hillary Clinton. I don't want Donald Trump. I want Jocko. Yeah. I think it might've been a good choice actually happen. I think it might've been a good choice. Yeah. Someone actually told me that I should run for vice president. That wouldn't have been a good choice. Uh, I don't know if you would, would've gotten my vote and I don't know.

Speaker 8:          02:35:45       I wouldn't have got my booty. Nonetheless. There's some cool stuff on Jocko star. That's the point. Um, you know, I'm not saying go buy some stuff. I'm thinking go on there, see what up, see what's on there. And if you like something, get something good way to support. Also, there's a little thing called psychological warfare. You ever heard it? Yeah, I think I have. It's pretty dope habit. I'll tell you what, all day. Okay. So I don't have to let you know that it's an album with tracks Jocko tracks. So basically if you don't already know the Rob Jones notes, John knows, I know obviously let's say you're on your campaign against weakness. That's, that's the official going turn candidate campaign against weakness. Right. And I'm going to be disciplined in all these areas on my life. Waking up early diet. I'm going to work out, you know, however many times a day study, study, get smarter, work harder.

Speaker 8:          02:36:40       Yeah. Just normal stuff. Normal getting after it. Yeah. Campaign. Yeah. And you have a moment of weakness like Jock, go with the mint chocolate chip ice cream. Avoid that. Jock obviously didn't listen to his own album with tracks, taco tracks of psychological warfare. What you do is anytime you, you come across these moments of weakness, listen, put a track, put a track in. Like if you're having a hard time waking up you to hit the snooze, whatever, boom. Get wake up, get up, wake up, wake up, wake up and get after it. That's the track name. Help you right through that weakness. Smashed the weakness

Speaker 4:          02:37:16       out actually. But yeah, psychological warfare, Jocko Willink, MP3, iTunes, wherever Amazon mp3s are being distributed, that's where you can get them. Uh, you can also on Amazon, you can get something called Jocko white tea. Rob Jones had his first Jocko white tea today. Delicious. Not only delicious, but I've noticed you've been very attentive. You're words are crisp and clear. I mean, you feel the power, right? Yeah. It totally angry at him. He's ready to rock and roll. Tenacity by a mental capacity and Carissa at least tenfold. Yeah, if not more. So there you go. Jocko white tea. You can get that on Amazon. It t legit though. How good does it taste? Oh, it's really good. And it does it, it doesn't really taste like tea, right? He likes kind of tastes like tea. Does have any sugar in it. No. You're telling me Jocko white tea doesn't have any sugar and taste that good and it tastes that good. What does it taste like? Vegetable. It tastes like victory. Uh, they, we got some books on Amazon and wherever you want to buy books. Extreme ownership, combat lesson, combat leadership lessons learned and how you can apply those to business and life way of the warrior kid.

Speaker 4:          02:38:35       Yeah. Weigh the warrior kid. That's what you need to get for every kid. You know, it is so helpful for kids. I wish I had that book when I was nine years old, 10 years old, 11 years old. It is so helpful and I'm getting such great feedback. So by that, for the kids, you know for sure coming up soon. The discipline equals freedom field manual.

Speaker 2:          02:39:04       Okay,

Speaker 4:          02:39:05       that's right. It is a field manual. How to implement and execute operation discipline into your life. Fall the field manual. You can get it from your local bookstore. You can get it from Barnes and noble. You can get it from Amazon. Let them all know what's up.

Speaker 2:          02:39:27       Okay.

You can email us@infoatechelonfront.com and in the meantime if you need us or you just want to check in, we are rolling kind of deep on the Inter webs on Twitter, on Instagram

Speaker 4:          02:39:56       and a face sheet ball hockey. Rob Jones is at Rob Jones Journey at Rob Jones journey. He's going to be documenting all this awesome slash could be stupid but could be mostly awesome stuff that he's doing and we like to watch people do crazy stuff. So yeah, we're going to watch you do that and I'll post a picture and then usually I like to put a little snippet of wisdom in there. It's a little paragraph for people to read. Nice a day. So the New York Times. Yeah. Don't, don't do that. Just go straight to the, to the Rob Jones snippet of wisdom. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          02:40:35       I like the example how you say you want to be the example because some people they say, I just want to be the exempt, but they don't explain it. You just explained her actually in a way that was kind of revealing to me where it makes sense. You know, you're like, Hey, I'm going to, and this goes for everything by the way, like if you want to, I do like a special effects sometimes and I'm like, man, I want to do this, but man, that's like some high enough, I can't do it on this. And then, but then let's say look it up on Youtube and be like, oh wait, look, he did it right here. And then, you know, sometimes it show him house show house, sometimes they don't. But like how you said like if you don't think, like if you think, oh, you had that kind of can't be done.

Speaker 8:          02:41:10       You don't like for so many of my position or whatever, you know? But then you see someone all the way, he's doing it and then you're doing it where it's like you're doing even more. So it's like, ah, you're kind of reaching more people in that way. Cause still you're doing these crazy things. Maybe one, maybe two other people be like, yeah, I can do that too. But most people there'll be like, can do that easy stuff, but I can do all this other stuff. You know what I mean? Other stuff that they didn't think they could do before.

Speaker 4:          02:41:32       That's good. That's the word. It's crazy. That's stupid. The stuff you're doing is awesome. It's crazy. You've got to be crazy to do it. Uh, so yeah, Rob Jones Journey and that includes Rob Jones, journey.com as well, which in that from there you can get the d to the donation page for when you're starting all this, all this, uh, 31 marathons in 31 days. Most people run a marathon and it, I think I've read it takes like six months to actually recover from a marathon.

Speaker 5:          02:42:06       Yeah, I guess it depends on your level of preparedness, but try and do it in about six hours.

Speaker 4:          02:42:14       That is awesome. Echo is at echo. Charles and I am at Willink Echo. You got anything else for today? Thank you for coming on. Rob Jones. Rob, any closing thoughts from you?

Speaker 5:          02:42:28       Oh, I just want to start by pointing out that I think every guest you've ever had on this podcast is somebody that I consider to be a hero and I it, I don't throw that around. They're patriots and they are heroes and it is humbling for me to be included. For you to have me on the podcast is vastly humbling for me to be included among the people that you deem worthy of being on the podcast. So I just want to thank both of you for, for having me and giving me this opportunity and I just hope that some of the stuff that I said can resonate with with some of the, some of the listeners and beyond that I've done a lot of stuff, but nobody does that by themselves. I have had so many people that have helped me, therapist, prosthetist, coaches, mentors and family, friends.

Speaker 5:          02:43:32       And then especially Pam, I mean I told you before she's doing everything. She was instrumental in getting this podcast done, getting me on as, as a guest here, took it upon herself to, to tweet you. She's calling press, she's helping me get venues. She's, it's been incredible and she's my number one supporter and uh, you know, too good for me, but hopefully she doesn't listen to that. Hopefully he's still, she'll continue to be diluted. Um, but yeah, I mean I'm, I'm at the top of the pyramid. Like I get all the kind of the notoriety and the congratulations for doing the stuff that I've done. But without the base of the pyramid, the pyramid is shit. It's to block on the ground. So without all these people, I mean, I wouldn't have accomplished it. I would have, I might have tried, but I wouldn't be, I wouldn't be where I am. Probably wouldn't be on the podcast. I've wouldn't have actually done anything.
