Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number one 56 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good evening, good evening resistance. Why didn't you resist today? Those who have continued to live on and comfort scold those who suffered, yes, resistance should have begun right there at the moment of the arrest itself, but it did not begin during a daylight arrest. There was always that brief and unique moment when they are leading you either inconspicuously on the basis of a cowardly deal you have made or else quite openly their pistols on holstered through a crowd of hundreds of just such doomed innocence as yourself. You weren't gagged.

Speaker 2:          00:00:52       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       You really can and you really ought to cry out to cry out. You were being arrested. That villains in disguise are trapping. People that are rest are being made on the strength of false denunciations, that millions are being subjected to silent reprisals. If many such outcries had been heard all over the city and the course of a day would not. Our fellow citizens perhaps have begun to bristle and would a rat in a wood arrests perhaps no longer have been so easy. Instead, not one sound comes from Europe, parched lips and that passing crowd naively believes that you and your executioners our friends out for a stroll. I myself often had the chance to cry out.

Speaker 2:          00:01:52       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:01:53       so why did I keep silent? Why in my last minute out in the open did I not attempt to enlighten the hoodwinked crowd? Why did I keep silent? Every man always has a dozen glib little reasons why he is right not to sacrifice himself. Some still have hopes of a favorable outcome to their case and are afraid to ruin their chances by outcry.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       So they keep silent and that right there is part of the opening of book one part one of the book the Gulag Archipelago by [inaudible] and I discussed it on the last podcast with Jordan Peterson, but I didn't dig into the actual text very much because, well I had Jordan Peterson on here and I rather just talk with him and allow him to talk rather than read and delve into the text itself. But the text is really good and I wanted to take today to go through at least, well to go through today part one of the Gulag archipelago and the version that I'm going through is not the abridged version but the full unabridged version. So if you end up looking for some of these passages in the abridged version that you might not find them. And I'm only going to go through part one today and maybe over time we'll go through all seven parts that are in three different volumes.

Speaker 1:          00:03:43       Uh, massive volumes. By the way, this one is 600 pages long, um, part to volume two. It looks like about another 600 pages. And then volume three looks to be, I don't know, maybe four or 500 pages. So I think we're talking maybe 1500 to 2000 pages, but it's a, it's a great read and it, like I said, in the future, if you get these will go will, I will, I'll say this in the future. Yes, we will go through all the books. If you want to get them now and read them, then eventually you'll be able to roll through them with us. And it's, as I said, I mean this, this, this book is a very powerful book, but I said this one when I was talking to Jordan, it's written and you could hear from even the opening there. It's, it's almost a conversation.

Speaker 1:          00:04:35       It's a very conversational writing that social needs and does. And so it's, it's pretty easy to read because it's not, it's just very compensates. Sounds like somebody telling you a story is basically what it's like. He's asking you questions, rhetorical questions, he's interacting with you, the reader. So it's a pretty fun read. It's not fun in the fact that you're reading about people being trapped, tortured, murdered in a gulag. But he does it in a, in a lighthearted way. If that's possible. Is that possible? I don't know if it's possible, but he seems to pull it off. I mean, you can even see just, just what I just read. Um, you know, you can see he's, he's having a conversation with you about it. You know, he's having a conversation. So that's what it's like. Let's go back to the book and I'm gonna pick up in a section where he's kind of explaining, and I, and I talked about this with Jordan and by the way, yeah, so if you haven't listened to one 55 with Jordan Peterson where we discuss some of this, some of the ideas in this book, we don't, we don't delve into the book too much in a magazine to cover those parts.

Speaker 1:          00:05:36       There's two little sections that we covered on a cover again today and kind of going a little bit more, but if you haven't listened to one 55 listen to one 55 and then then come back and listen to this. This one, this section of the book social knits and is talking about the fact that he's a war hero for all practical purposes and he's about to get rolled up and arrested by his brigade commander and he, he's talking about his brigade commander and the situation that he's now going into 10 days before I had led my own recognizance battery almost intact out of the fire pocket in which the 12 heavy guns of his artillery battalion battalion had been left and now he had to renounce me because of a piece of paper with a seal on it. I knew instantly I had been arrested because of my correspondence with a school friend and understood from what direction to expect danger. So He's been, if our pocket, if you don't know what that means, it means he was surrounded by the enemy and he was able to lead his troops out of there almost intact, which means they took some casualties, maybe lost some guys, but he was able to lead his men out of there. And yet he wrote a letter and he mentioned earlier like what he says in the letter basically says that the leadership that Stalin's making some mistakes and guess what? They screen those letters. They read what he wrote and they arrest him.

Speaker 1:          00:07:08       So war is hell. And he talks a little bit about that here. For three weeks the war had been going on inside Germany and all of us knew very well that if the girls were German, they could be raped and then shot. This was almost a combat distinction. Had they been Polish girls or our own displaced Russian girls, they could have been chased naked around the garden and slapped on the behind an amusement no more.

Speaker 2:          00:07:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:43       By the way, that's just a little, a little, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:07:50       of what that war between the Russians and the Germans was the Russians and the Germans. We talked about installing Greg, but yeah, and we talked a little bit about what happened with civilians. There's a little taste of what happens to civilians in those situations. It's a nightmare going on the history, this is a chapter two, the history of our sewage disposal system and this is where he expands and explains sort of his view of the prisons as a whole back to the book. And it's well known that any Oregon withers a way if it is not used. Therefore, if we know that the Soviet security Oregon or organs and they christened themselves with this vial word praise and exalted above all living things have not died off even to the extent of one single tentacle, but instead have grown new ones and strengthen their muscles. It is easy to do so that they have had constant exercise through the sewer pipes, the flow pulsed, sometimes the pressure was higher than x, then had been projected, sometimes lower, but the prison sewers were never empty. The blood, the sweat and the urine into which we were taped, POLST through them continuously

Speaker 1:          00:09:15       and he uses this, this term, which I guess the, the Soviets actually called the prison system organs and how the blood of the organs was these people. And this is something that I talked a little bit about with Jordan back to the book and even though Len and at the end of 1917 in order to establish strictly revolutionary order, demanded merciless suppression of attempts at anarchy on the part of drunkards, cool against counter-revolutionaries and other persons. So that's how it starts off. It starts off with that. We're going after, these are the people that need to be rounded up. The people that need to be rounded up are drunkards, hooligans, counter-revolutionaries in other persons. That's where it starts. And then it continues and it goes on. And he writes an essay. Leaden writes an essay called how to organize, how to organize the competition. And he proclaimed this again, this is Len pro crank proclaimed common, the common United purpose of purging the Russian land of all kinds of harmful in sex and the term insects.

Speaker 1:          00:10:26       And under the term insects, he included not only all class enemies, but also workers malingering at their work. For example, the type setters of the Petrograd party printing shops. So you can see, you can see this is starting to expand already. Mm. It starts off just, hey, it's hooligans and drunkards and counter-revolutionaries. Now all of a sudden it's getting towards workers that are being lazy. You're being a little bit lazy. Guess what? You need to be unity, be, uh, arrested and you're one of these insects. And then this is how this grows in. And he goes through this massive list of the people that need to be come insects. And he describes them as in sex. So this included local self governing bodies in the provinces they were in sex. And people in the cooperative movements, they were in sex as we're, anyone that owned their own home was an insect.

Speaker 2:          00:11:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:21       There were not a few insects among the teachers in the gymnasiums and the church parish councils were made up almost exclusively of insects. All priests were insects and all those Tolstoy. Ian's who when they undertook to serve the Soviet government for example on the railroads refuse to sign the required oath to defend the Soviet government with gun in hand, thereby showed themselves to be insects too. The railroads were particularly important for, there were indeed many insects hidden beneath the railroad and telegraph. Hers they were in sex and he just goes on and on. Um, all Russian executive committee of the Union of railroad workers and other trade unions were also often filled with insects hostile to the working class. So this paragraph just goes on and on and basically what it, what it ends up as, everyone's an insect. That's how it ends up.

Speaker 2:          00:12:28       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:12:29       Everyone's an insect and therefore everyone must be arrested eventually. Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:12:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:37       Here's, here's another expansion here. The, this is the a decree from the Council of peoples come commit commissar ours signed by lending on July 22nd, 1918 those guilty of selling or buying up or keeping for sale in the way of business food products which had been placed under the monopoly of the republic, they deserve imprisonment for a term of not less than 10 years combined with the most for severe forced labor and confiscation of all their property. So if you operate on any kind of black market whatsoever, 10 years confiscation of everything you own, that's where we're at right now. 1921 begin with the checkout order number 10 dated January 8th to intensified the repression of the Bruges Waze. Now when the civil war had ended, repression was not to be reduced but intensified.

Speaker 1:          00:13:42       So the civil war's over, the revolution is over and you think, okay, the is over. We can back off a little bit. No, no. Now we're going to go harder. In that same year, the practice of arresting students began. The arrests of members of all non Bolshevik parties were expanded and systematized, not one citizen of the former Russian state who would ever joined a party other than the Bolshevik party could avoid his fate. Men of religion, we're an inevitable part of every annual catch and their silver locks gleaned in every sale and in every prisoner transport en route to the soviets t islands. And those are prisons. Monks and nuns who's black habits had been a distinctive feature of old Russian life. We're intensively rounded up on every hand placed under arrest and sent into exile.

Speaker 1:          00:14:47       As Tanya Covich wrote, you can pray, you can pray freely, but just so god alone can here. So you're allowed to pray. But only God can hear it. Meaning don't let anyone else here. And by the way, because she wrote that she got a 10 year sentence for that, all persons convicted of religious activity received tenors, which is the 10 year sentence. So you can see how this just gets completely out of control. And one thing about this book is it's, it's not really chronological. So it goes through hole like this first chapters. It goes through from like the revolution all the way through after the war so and then you and then you go through, it's not chronological, it just kind of jumps around a little bit so you have to, you kind of have to just pay attention the whole time to what time frame he's talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:15:50       Luckily it gives a lot of dates on when things are happening. For instance here back to the book, this therapy continued full speed from 1927 on and immediately exposed to the proletariat all the causes of our economic failures and Sorta just, okay, let's pay attention to this. All the causes of our economic failures and it's shortages, so obviously Russia is going through all kinds of problems at this time and here's what caused them. There was wrecking and wrecking is their term for basically a saboteur. Someone that's causing the problems is a record. There was wrecking in the people's Commissariat of railways roads. That was why it was hard to get aboard the train and why there were interruptions and supplies. There were, there was wrecking in the Moscow electric power system and interruptions in power. There was wrecking in the oil industry, hence the shortage of kerosene.

Speaker 1:          00:16:40       Kerosene. There was wreckage and textile, hence nothing for a working man to wear where the, in the coal industry there was colossal wrecking, hence no heat in the metal, a jury in a metal, a jury, defense machinery, shipbuilding chemical mining, gold and platinum industries in irrigation. Everywhere there were these pos filled boils of wrecking enemies with slide rules were on all sides. So there they have problems in the country and it's the what the party is saying, hey this is because we've got these, these wreckers, the saboteurs everywhere, enemies with slide rules, the GPU puffed and panted in its efforts to grab off and drag off all the wreckers in the capitals and in the providence provinces, the Gpu collegiums and the proletarian courts kept hard at work, sifting through the viscous sewage and every day the workers gasp to learn and sometimes they didn't learn from the papers of new vial deeds. So he had the, the, the, the state press, putting out all this is what's happening. These are the wreckers. Every industry, every factory and every handicraft artele had to find wreckers in its ranks and no sooner had they begun to look than they found them,

Speaker 1:          00:18:10       continues on when not long afterward, the new peoples commissar of the railroads ordered that average loads should be increased and even doubled and then tripled. And for this discovery received order of Lennon along with other others of our leaders, the malicious engineers who protested became known as known as limiters. They raised the outcry that this was too much and would result in the breakdowns of the rolling stock and they were rightly shocked for their lack of faith in the possibilities of socialist transport. So that right there sums up a lot because you're in this situation and there's some buddy at the top that saying, oh, we need to transport more stuff on the railroads. Cool. Just load them up more. And he actual engineers are saying they can't handle that much weight. Hey, they can't handle that much weight. It's going to ruin the trains. It's going to break the trains. And what do they do? Shoot him, shoot him in the back, shoot him in the back of the head because, and they called him limiters. They gave him a name. You're a limiter. You just don't want to make this happen. That's your problem.

Speaker 1:          00:19:29       And there's a, there's a

Speaker 1:          00:19:32       great passage that I read in a book that I'm going to read right now and this book that I'm gonna pull up real quick passage from a book called basic economics written by a famous very famous economist I should say, named Thomas Soule. And he's just talking about, he's talking about how they tried to regulate prices in the Soviet Union. And there was a way to set the prices on everything. And he's, and it says this, so this is from, this is the role of prices, is the name of the chapter and basic economics by Thomas Sal. The significant, the significance of free market prices and the allocation of resources can be seen more clearly by looking at situations where prices are not allowed to perform this function during the era of the government directed economy of the Soviet Union. For example, prices. We're not set by supply and demand, but by central planners who sent resources to their various uses by direct commands, supplemented by prices that the planners raised or lowered as they saw fit.

Speaker 1:          00:20:50       And now he goes into this part where he takes these two Soviet economists and they described a situation in which their government raise the price. It would pay for mole skins, leading hunters to sell more of them. And here's that description and this is these two Soviet economists smell Evan pop off who described the situation where the government raised the price, it pay for mole skins. Here we go, state purchases increased and now all the distribution centers are filled with these pelts. Industry is unable to use them all and they often rot in warehouses before they can be processed. The Ministry of Light Industry has already requested. Go, Scott, come in.

Speaker 1:          00:21:39       The Ministry of Light Industry has already requested twice to lower purchasing prices, but the question has not been decided yet. And this is not surprising, it's members are too busy to decide. They have no time besides setting the prices on these pelts. They have to keep track of another 24 million prices. So that's what happens. And that's what's going on. You've got somebody trying to, essentially it's the opposite of decentralized command. Mm hmm. So you've got, you've got people trying to figure out what a, to what this mole skin pelt should cost. And what happens is when they, when the government raises the price, they'll pay for it. What do all the people do? They go and gather more of these pelts and now there's an overstock of them. And they try and get them to lower the prices. So people weren't stopping. We'll stop, turn them in, but they can't do it quick enough because I've got 24 million other prices that they got a set for the government. So that in a nutshell is why all these problems are one of the major reasons why all these problems are occurring. And whenever somebody tries to, um, resist what commands are being given, they're getting shot. Limiters. Yeah. And this is one I talked about a little bit with Jordan in September, 1930 the famine organizers were tried with a great hue and cry. They were the ones, there they are.

Speaker 2:          00:23:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:05       There were 48 records in the food industry stolen, carried out the first such effort in connection with the trial of the famine organizers. And how could it not succeed when everyone was starving in boldness Russia? And everyone was always looking about and asking, where did all our dear Brett get to? Therefore, before the cur court verdict, the workers and employees raffles, he voted for the death penalty for the scoundrels on trial. It was the newspaper March of millions and the roar rose outside the windows of the courtroom. Death, death, death. So for these types of reasons for this centralized command doesn't work. Not to mention we, you know what they did, took the farms away from the people that actually knew how to farm there. There's complete famine and they're blue. They're blaming it on the 48 people that were saboteurs inside the, uh, the agriculture industry. Completely insane.

Speaker 1:          00:24:15       And this one I read with Jordan on a, read it again in the Russian, in Russian, a Kulak is a myth, a miserly, dishonest rural trader who grows rich not by his own labor, but through someone else's, through your surgery and operating as a middleman in every locality be even before the revolution. Such cool acts could be numbered on one's fingers and the revolution totally destroyed their basis of activity. Subsequently, after 1917 by a transfer of meaning, the name Kulak began to be applied to all those who in any way hired workers, even if it was only when they were temporarily short of working hands in their own families. So a Kulak started off as someone that was trying to rip people off, but then they just started applying it to everyone. Anyone that hired someone was a Kulak and it has a derogatory tone to it.

Speaker 2:          00:25:10       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:25:11       continuing on, but the inflation of this scathing term Kulak proceeded relentlessly and by 1930 all strong peasants in general, we're being, we're being so cold, all peasant strong and management, strong and work or even strong merely in convictions. The term Kulak was used to smash the strength of the peasantry.

Speaker 1:          00:25:33       Beyond this. In every village, there were people who in one way or another had personally gotten in the way of the local activists. This was the perfect time to settle accounts with them of jealousy, envy, an insult, a new word was needed for all those victims as a class and it was born by this time. It had no social or economic content whatsoever, but had a marvelous sound pot, Kulak neck, a person aiding the cool acts. In other words, I consider you a comp, an accomplice of the enemy. Now, what's interesting about this, and I had, I had a bunch of people point this out, this, this is when we take words, powerful words, and we start to throw them at people and we use them universally, that's, that's going to cause a problem. And you can see it all the time right now in social media and in the, yeah, I guess you see it primarily in social media from like far left extremists and far right extremists to the far right.

Speaker 1:          00:26:32       Anybody that's to the left to them is like a communist to the far left. Anybody that's to the right of them is a racist or a Nazi and they, those words around and those words that you shouldn't use those words. It's like using Kulak like that. That's not the person that hires someone isn't a Kulak. Yeah, right. Yeah. I like that doesn't work. So we escalate these terms and that's, that's not a healthy thing to do. I mean, I think it was, um, when, yeah, I mean, when Jordan Peterson gets compared to Adolf Hitler. Yeah, right. They come here, Jordan Peterson to Adolf Hitler.

Speaker 2:          00:27:15       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:27:16       Come on. Yeah. Okay. You don't like some of Jordan Peterson's ideas. Yeah. Okay. That's cool. Don't call them Adolf Hitler. Yeah. Like that's just not realistic. Yeah. It's not helpful to, you know, or people don't like his ideas or whatever, like for a specific reason, you know, rather than identify the reason they dislike, package them up and put an ugly bow tie on it and be like, yeah, I hate you. You kind of thing

Speaker 1:          00:27:46       in the right. You know, if you think about during McCarthyism, right, it was, hey, anti America, you're anti American, you're a communist. It was like they were flagging people like that. So both sides can do this. In this case, it's, in this case, it's the [inaudible]. It's the communists be escalating these terms. We've seen the right do it. We see the left do it. Not a smart thing to do. Don't throw those terms out where they don't belong. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:28:20       Talk to him about this a little bit with Jordan and there was a wave and then we talked about wave. You talking about waves of people that would flow into the prisons and there's all these different ways. You're talking about dozens and dozens of different waves. There was a wave for snipping ears, the nighttime snipping of individual ears of grain in the field, a totally new type of agriculture activity, a new type of harvesting. The wave of those caught doing this was not small. It included many tens of thousands of peasants. Many of them, not even adults, but boys, girls and small children whose elders had sent them out at night to snip because they had no hope of receiving anything from the collective farm for their daytime Labor, Labor for this bitter and not very productive occupation and extreme of poverty to which the peasants had not been driven. Even in serfdom, the court's handed out a full measure, 10 years for what ranked as an especially dangerous theft of socialists property. Again, that again, that's why I say this book is kind of light to read, write and he's, he's, he's kind of funny, right? Especially dangerous staffed of Socialists properties. Talking about taking a one year of of grain.

Speaker 3:          00:29:33       Is he saying that like on his own kind of thing or is, is that what, what the people say? That's you. That's what the, like you stole communist

Speaker 4:          00:29:43       Socialist property, you stole it and you must be destroyed 10 years cause you took a little piece of grain. Yes. Like these, like if you get a, I dunno Jay walking ticket or something, hey you committed a crime here, criminal, you know, kind of thing. Yeah. You can just call someone a criminal usually has them, even though technically you know, they're not kinda wrong, you know? Yeah. I got rolled up in Vegas. Yeah. I got rolled up in Vegas. I was with sarge. Sure. We were crossing one of the big streets in Vegas and I had to grab something or I dropped something or I was tying my shoe or doing something and the, the walking light went red. But the cars weren't going yet and sarge had already walked across. So I just kind of jogged cross, you know, before any car started moving squad car lights. Then 10 seconds later, four squad cars. I don't know if they thought I was somebody else. So I'm there, you know, on, on the curb. Facedown. Facedown. Sarge is videoing it.

Speaker 4:          00:30:54       Laughing at me. Yes I was a criminal and still eat. But what then did what they do? You did you get dressed, you know, they gave me a ticket. They gave me a ticket for jaywalking. Yeah, well I guess criminal rate. What's a criminal? And they probably thought, they probably thought, oh, we're going to roll up this drunk idiot guy. I'm totally, so it was up there for the UFC, you know, I was up there with a fighter. I don't know, we were probably going to, uh, you know, cut weight or something with a fighter and there I am getting rolled up, rolled down the road. There's no cars, cars. They must've thought I was somebody else who has to be thought a big, you know, and it's like, Hey, this guy looks like he could get in trouble or something. And Jay walking, obviously a car, but the, I guess when you think about a criminal, right?

Speaker 4:          00:31:40       Criminal, what's, what's, what does that, is that like someone who commits? Imagine it. In this case, what they'd say is, Oh, you were blocking the transportation of socialist property, therefore you, that's a crime against the state you get in 10 years. That's the same. That's exactly what we're talking about, has exactly what we're talking about. Western jaywalking get 10 years for going out and clipping a single grain of a single year of corn or grain, getting 10 years for that and you're 12 years old or whatever crime against the state. It's like when people throw around the word treason, you know? You know how like when when people get into political debates around oil, that's treason. That's the, that's your right. There's people throw that word around when it shouldn't be thrown around. Be careful when you, when you commit treason, that's definitely a big deal, man. So people say, uh Oh, what? What's a good example of fats? Treason. Treason is a big deal. You shouldn't throw that word around unless you're thinking somebody needs the death penalty. Yeah. So yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       it's a good example. Check back to the book. Paradoxically enough, every act of the all penetrating eternally wakeful organs over a span of many years was based solely on one article of the hundred and 40 articles of the Non General Division of the Criminal Criminal Code of 1926 so this is where all this crap came from. They wrote this criminal code of 1926 and the including the great, powerful, abundant, highly ramified multi-form wide sweeping article 58 which summed up the world not so much through the exact terms of its sections as in their extended dialectical interpretation. In all truth, there is no step fought action or lack of action under the heavens, which could not be punished by the heavy hand of article 58 the article itself could not be worded in such broad terms, but it proved possible to interpret it this broadly. Article 58 was not in that division of the code dealing with the political crimes and nowhere was it categorized as political?

Speaker 1:          00:33:51       No, it was included with crimes against public order and organized gangsterism in a division of crimes against the state. And then he goes through all these various sections of article 58 which had 14 sections in section one we learned that any action, and according to article six of the Criminal Code, any absence of action directed toward the weakening of state power was considered to be counterrevolutionary broadly interpreted. This turned out to include the refusal of a prisoner in camp to work when the state went in a state of starvation and exhaustion. That was a weakening of state power and it was punished by execution because if you're in prison and you're starving, but you're not doing the work you're supposed to do, you're doing something that's hurting the state. So he needed to die. This is a key. You can't, I was having trouble and I think even Jordan, like we were trying to get the explained that this is like a sick comedy, like you can't really, we kept saying back and forth to each other. We're like, you can't make this up. You can't make this up.

Speaker 3:          00:34:58       Like, you can't make that up. And this is real. Yeah. This a sick comedy. That's an interesting yet I'm kinda accurate way it is. He, you know, it's like, you know how I can't think of an example. You know how someone will, like, he'll say, I dunno cable actually, you know what it was? It was like some cable commercial, is it, they do this in a funny way of comedy way. They'll say, hey, don't get cable because if, and then it'll say like, what does he say? He says something like, yeah, if you don't listen to your parents, you don't do your homework. If you don't do your homework, you don't get a good job if you don't get a good job, you know? And it's this whole thing. And then crack house. Yeah. So don't end up in a crack house, you know, kind of thing. And the related to the city and it's like, I see what you did there, you know, and each one. Right. But it's like you just being funny, like obviously that's not that, you know, but they're just drawing all these parallels, tear everything. So this one, they must be the same, you know, kind of thing, you know, like, yeah, if you get, if you cancel cable, I forget how it goes.

Speaker 1:          00:35:57       But you know, to your point, this is that kind of, this sounds like it just be that crazy. Exactly. But this is real. When our soldiers were sentenced to only 10 years for allowing themselves to be taken prisoner action injurious to the cell, Soviet military might, this was humanitarian to the point of being illegal. According to the stolen this code, they all should have been shot upon their return home. So they're saying, you know what, the people that were allowed, the Soviet soldiers that allowed themselves to be captured, they only got 10 years, which is actually kind of illegal because they should have been shot via article 19 of the criminal code via intent. In other words, no trees and had taken place. But the interrogator envisioned an intention to betray and that was enough to justify a full term. The same as actual. So if I just think you had the intent, that's good enough.

Speaker 1:          00:36:54       You're getting 10 years. Section three was assisting in any way or by any means a foreign state at war. This section made it possible to condemn any citizen who had been an occupied territory, whether he had nailed on the appeal of a German soldier shoe or sold them a bunch of radishes. You get your Tanner right there. There's these two things, psh, which is suspicion of espionage and an Nsh, which is on proven Aspen espionage. You can charge someone with unproven espionage. What does that even mean? Hey, we're just, you know, we're, you're guilty for unproven. It's like you're guilty of unproven murder.

Speaker 3:          00:37:34       What does that mean? Oh, it's not proven, but that's what you're guilty of and that's why you're going to die. Or maybe it's the kind of like, you know, here they'll say like, hey, he, he's a, he's in a legend. You know, before you are proven in the court of law kind, maybe you're in that window, you know, no, nothing proven espionage and you're going to go to prison for 10 years

Speaker 1:          00:37:51       years for it. Section eight covered terror. Terror was construed in a very broad sense, not simply a matter of putting bombs under governors carriage is, but for example, smashing the face of a personal enemy. If he was an activist in the party or the police that was terror. And then he starts talking about section 10 which is propaganda or agitation containing an appeal for the overflow, subverting or weakening of the Soviet power. Andy equally the dissemination or preparation or possession of literary materials of similar content. So any, if you're drawn in propaganda, you can get trouble. But here we go. The term preparation of literary materials covered every letter note or private diary, even when only the original document existed. So Amy thing that you write down is subject.

Speaker 2:          00:38:45       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:38:47       well that's why he went to prison for a letter. Right. The real wall underlying this, the arrest all those years was the assignment of quotas. The norm set the planned allocations. Every city, every district, every military unit was assigned a specific quota of arrest to be carried out by a stipulated time. That's like when cops get the quota for the speeding tickets. Yeah. That's when you get the ticket for

Speaker 4:          00:39:17       for [inaudible] 38 in a 35. Is that true though? Sometimes it is. Again, I don't know. I thought, I mean I thought it was true, but I have no idea. Like is that just a myth? You know how like people they, they're just mad because they got a ticket, you know, I call it photo but it's not even real. You know, like that's not even a real thing. I have no idea. It could be a method. I just believed. Yeah. You know, cause you've probably got that ticket when you're 38 in the 35. Him and me neither. That's why I'm questioning it. I did get pulled over a few months ago. But eyebrow. Your tinted windows. No, I was going too fast in this area. Oh, straight up. Speeding. Yeah. Well you got off. They give you a break. Yeah. Cause they, they'd recognize, you know what I think, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:40:09       check

Speaker 1:          00:40:11       back to the book piles of Victims Hills a victims. Here's some other people got arrested and electrician had a high tension line break in his sector. 58, seven. That's the article 20 years,

Speaker 2:          00:40:24       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:25       A plumber turned off the loud speaker in his room. Every time the endless letters to Stalin were being read, his next door neighbor denounced him. Where aware is that neighbor today he got soe socially dangerous element. Eight years.

Speaker 2:          00:40:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:44       By the end of numbered, by the end of summer 1941 becoming bigger in the autumn, the wave of the encircled was surging. It again, the waves talking about waves of prisoners that are showing up and the waves of the encircled were surging in. These were the defenders of their native land, the very same warriors whom the cities or had seen sent off to the front with bouquets and bands a few months before who had then sustain the heaviest tank assaults of the Germans and in the general chaos and through no fault of their own had spent a certain time as isolated units, not in enemy imprisonment, not at all, but in temporary INCIRCL mint and later had broken out. You understand what that means? It means they're surrounded by the enemy didn't get captured by the enemy. They get surrounded for a little while and then they break out. They'd get back to friendly lines and instead of back to the book and instead of being given a brotherly embrace on their return such as every other army in the world would have given them, instead of being given a chance to rest up to visit their families and then return to their units. They were held on suspicion, disarmed, deprived of rights, and taken away in groups to identification points in screening centers were officers of the special branches started interrogating them, distrusting not only their every word, but their very identity

Speaker 1:          00:42:11       traders of the motherland under 58 one B, but at first until the standard penalty was finally determined, they got less than 10 years.

Speaker 2:          00:42:24       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:42:31       You can't imagine that people would go along. You can't imagine that people go along with this, right? Yeah. The level of fear that you have to have as a, as a nation and as a people to go along with that, right there are our frontline troops were surrounded by the enemy. They managed to escape and get back in. Now we're going to put them on trial and put them in prison. It's, it's, it's insanity. Next chapter talks about interrogation

Speaker 1:          00:43:07       going to the book. If the intellectuals in the plays of checkoff who spent all their time guessing what would happen in 2030 or 40 years had been told that in 40 years interrogation by torture would be practiced in Russia, that prisoners would have their skulls squeezed with iron rings, that a human being would be lowered into an acid bath, that they would be trust up naked to be bitten by ants and bedbugs that are ram rod heated over a primus stove would be thrust up their anal canal. The secret brand that a mans genitals would be slowly crushed beneath the toll the boot, and that in the luckiest possible circumstances, prisoners would be tortured by being kept from sleeping for a week by thirst and by being beaten to a bloody pulp. Not one of checkoffs plays would have gotten to its end because all the heroes would have gone off to insane asylums if the intellectuals and the plays of checkoff who spent all their time guessing what would happen in 2030 or 40 years had been told that in 40 years interrogation by torture would be practiced in Russia.

Speaker 1:          00:44:09       That prisoners would have their skulls squeezed within iron rings, that a human being would be lowered into an acid bath, that they would be trust up naked to be bitten by ants and bedbugs that are ram rod heated over a primus stove would be thrust up their anal canal, that a mans genitals would be slowly crushed the Tova Jack boot, and that in the luckiest possible circumstances, prisoners would be tortured by being kept from sleeping for a week by thirst and by being beaten into a bloody pulp. Not one of checkoffs plays would have gotten to its end because all the heroes would have gone off to insane asylums. Horrible. So they have these, they're doing these savage interrogations and torture. Continuing on the time allotted for investigation was not used to unravel the crime in 95 cases, out of 102 exhaust where down weaken and render helpless the defendant so that he would want to end it at any cost.

Speaker 1:          00:45:26       Then he talks about some of the methods that we're using. He talked about some of the torture and these were just some of the kind of the, the basic, the, the, the base line abuse that you're going to get. You're going to get capped from sleep. You're going to get persuasion. They'd say, look, you're going to get prison term no matter what happens, but if you resist, you croak right here in prison, you lose your health. But if you go to camp, you'll have fresh air and sunlight. So why not sign this paper right now?

Speaker 2:          00:45:56       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:45:56       They do that. They do, they do psychological contrast, you know, good cop, bad cop, humiliation, extreme confusion, intimidation. They tell him we've got hard labor camps. Now if you can fast, you go to an easy camp. But if you're starting or stubborn, you'll get 25 years in handcuffs. In the minds, they'd lie. Of course they'd play on the affections for those. One loved will arrest your daughter in locker in this cell with syphilis sticks. That's that one that they always throw, right? They're going to break. Oh, they can't break you. Cool. Guess what they're going to do to your daughter. Guess what they're gonna do to your wife. Guess what they're going to do to your son.

Speaker 2:          00:46:45       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:46:52       Now he has a great paragraph and I talked about this a little bit with Jordan, but it's a reflecting on his behavior. And this is when he started talking to him. And again, I

Speaker 2:          00:47:10       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:47:11       skip through a lot of the interrogation. Um, you have to read the book. You have to read the whole book, and he to really jump into that, I hit the high wave tops of it. And this section, he's talking about the guards, right? The people that they call, he called them blue caps. These are people that were the guards, people that were processing you through the gulags and

Speaker 1:          00:47:35       you know, much like, much like Jordan kinda talks about seeing himself as the bad guy, right? The perpetrator as opposed to always seeing like, oh, everyone thinks I wouldn't do that. I'd be one of these victims. He, uh, social knits and sees himself in a way he reflects on the way he behaved actually as an officer, as a privileged officer in the Russian army. And this is, this is such a great little section about leadership because it tells you what not to do as a leader. So here we go. And this is a great start off to this. It starts off here. Back to the book. Pride grows in the human heart, like lard on a pig. I tossed out orders to my subordinates that I would not allow them to question, convinced that no orders could be wiser. That's check number one right there. There's, these are things not to do as a leader. I throw out orders to my subordinates without letting them question them, convinced in his own mind that da my orders the best, worst, completely wrong. Next, even at the front where one might have thought death made equals of assault. My power soon convinced me that I was a superior human being

Speaker 1:          00:48:58       wrong. You're not better than your troops. Next seated there, I heard them out as they stood at attention. I interrupted them. I issued commands. I addressed fathers and grandfathers with the familiar downgrading form of address. While they of course address me formally, I sent them out to repair wire under shell fire so that my superiors would not reproach me.

Speaker 1:          00:49:26       I ate my officer's ration of butter with roles without giving a thought as to why I had a right to do it and why the rank and file soldiers did not. So, hey, we're out there in the field. You're going to eat whatever shoe leather and I'm over here eating my butter would roles. I, of course had a personal servant assigned to me in polite terms, an orderly whom I badgered one way or another in order to look after my person and prepare my meals separately from the soldiers. I forced my soldiers to put their backs into it and dig me a special dugout at every new BIVOUAC and to haul the heaviest beams to support it so that I would be as comfortable and as safe as possible. And wait a minute, yes, my battery always had a guard house to meaning a little prison cell. What kind of guard guardhouse could there be in the woods? It was a pit of course, although it had a roof

Speaker 2:          00:50:22       on, it

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       talks about imprisoning song. Uh, if he should cough was imprisoned there for losing his horse and pop golf for maltreating his car beand yes, just a moment. I can remember more. They sewed me a map case out of a German hide, not human, but from a car seat, but I didn't have a strap for it and I was unhappy about that. Then all of a sudden they saw some partisan commissar from the local district Party committee wearing just the right kind of strap and they took it away from him. We are the army. We have seniority.

Speaker 2:          00:51:01       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:02       Finally I coveted that scarlet box and I remember how they took it away and got it. For me, that's what shoulder boards do to a human being. So when you get rank, when you put on those shoulder boards, keep your ego in check.

Speaker 2:          00:51:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:27       Don't, don't act like that.

Speaker 2:          00:51:31       Okay

Speaker 1:          00:51:31       then believe me, I mean I saw plenty of people like act like that in the military and they were hated by their troops.

Speaker 2:          00:51:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:44       Continuing on. So let the reader who expects this book to be a political [inaudible] slam, it's covers shut right now. If it were only all so simple, if only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them.

Speaker 2:          00:52:04       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:04       But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being and who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart. So if you're not careful, you got that evil in you.

Speaker 2:          00:52:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:22       During the life of any heart, this line keeps changing place. Sometimes it's squeezed one way by exuberant evil and sometimes it shifts to allow enough space for good to flourish. One and the same human being is at various ages and under various circumstances, a totally different human being. At times he's close to being a devil at times to sainthood, but his name doesn't change. And to that name we ascribe the whole lot good and evil. And that's a line that you hear Jordan Peterson read that line a lot or say that line a lot. The line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being cause we all got a little piece of darkness in our hearts that you need to watch out for.

Speaker 2:          00:53:09       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:53:13       Continuing on a little bit on that theme, the trouble lies in the way these classic you evil doers are pictured. They recognize themselves as evil doers, doers, and they know their souls are black. And the reason I cannot leave unless I do so I'll set my father against my brother. I'll drink the victim sufferings until I'm drunk with them.

Speaker 1:          00:53:32       But no, that's not the way it is to do evil. A human being must first of all, believe that what he is doing is good or else that it's a well considered active in conformity with natural law, fortunately is in the nature of the human being to speak, uh, to seek a justification for his actions, ideology, ideology. That is what gives evil doing. It's long sought justification and gives the evil doer the necessary steadfastness and determination that is the social theory which helps to make his axing good instead of bad in his own eyes and other's eyes so that he won't hear reproaches and kerchiefs curses. But we'll receive praise and honors. That was how agents of the inquisition fortified their wills by invoking Christianity, the conquerors of foreign lands by extolling the grand jury of the motherland, the colonizers by civilization, the Nazis by race, the Jacobeans early and late by equality brotherhood and the happiness of future generations. Thanks to ideology. The 20th century was faded to experience evil doing on a scale calculated in the millions. This cannot be denied or passed over nor suppressed. How then do we dare insists that evil doers do not exist? And who was it that destroyed these millions? Without evil doers, it would have been no archipelago.

Speaker 1:          00:55:09       So this is again, something that we see a lot today when people get on and we see it in the past. Obviously he gave all the examples right there. I mean the inquisition, we haven't covered that on the podcast yet, but we probably need to.

Speaker 2:          00:55:24       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:55:25       Because that was a damn nightmare. Yeah. And it was a nightmare with people that were saying, hey, this is for the good of Christianity. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55:35       And you can go right on down the list when people make, do people do evil, they have this ideological oftentimes have this ideological backing behind them. They're doing it for this great cause. And he gets here and I got a book in the, um, in the queue that's probably going to get done, which we're going to approach this thing right here. Evidently evil doing also has a thresh hold magnitude. Yes. A human being hesitates and Bob's back and forth between good and evil all his life. He slips, falls back, clambers up, repents. Things begin to dark and again, just so long as the threshold of evil doing is not crossed, the possibility of returning remains and he himself was still within reach of our hope. But when through the density of evil, the result either of their own extreme degree of absoluteness of his power, he suddenly crosses that threshold. He has left humanity behind and without perhaps the possibility of return. So there's some situations where people just go, they're not coming back. They're just going to do evil. That's the way it's going to be. And I have a book in the queue right now that we're probably going to do that. We'll explore that departure from being able to return.

Speaker 2:          00:57:04       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:57:06       Continuing on. The only soldier in the world who cannot surrender is the soldier of the world's one and only Red Army. That's what it says in our military statutes. You cannot surrender, no surrender. There is war, there is death, but there is no surrender of discovery. What it means is go and die. We will go on living. And if you lose your legs yet managed to return from calf captivity on crutches, we will convict you. And he mentions the lending grounder Ivan off commander of a machine gun platoon in the Finnish war who lost both legs and was imprisoned.

Speaker 1:          00:57:51       Incident lead is very naive to say what for? In other words, what for, why are they going to prison? At no time have government's been moralist, they never imprisoned people and executed them for having done something they imprisoned and executed them to keep them from doing something. They imprisoned. All those POW is of course not for treason to the motherland because it was absolutely clear even to a fool that only the vlogs off men could be accused of treason, which is a group that we'll talk about them a little bit. But there was a, a general named wows off that actually became a leader of Russian soldiers fighting against Russia alongside the Nazis. Hmm. So he's saying, yeah, those guys were traders against, but the normal pow is a normal long, they weren't traders back to the book. They were imprisoned to all of them. To keep them from telling their fellow villagers about Europe will be eye, doesn't see the heart, doesn't grieve for. So just because these people had seen what it was like, you got to go to prison, you know too much.

Speaker 1:          00:58:58       You could have acquired a very harmful spirit through living freely among Europeans. And if you had not been afraid to escape and continue to fight, it meant you were a determined person and thus doubly dangerous in the motherland. Thinking about that because you had the courage to fight on and escape and get back. That means you're a courageous person and you're even more of a threat because you know how live totally backwards. Now, like I said, this guy flies off. Um, he, he was surrounded and wanted to retreat and got told no and they, his army was basically a lot, most of it was wiped out. And then he was kind of wandering and escaped somewhat, and they joined up with a keep captured, joined up with some other troops that other Russian troops that were now pissed off, right? That they didn't, they, you what?

Speaker 1:          00:59:59       You weak. You wouldn't allow us to surrender. You wouldn't allow us to break out your windows, allow us to leave. So they're pissed. It stolen. And so then they turned and these vias off guys ended up fighting and I'm sure we'll do a book on these guys at some point. But um, you know, he became, he became the leader, Andre Vilas off and they fought and they fought hard because they know, they knew that they had no, and they weren't going to live if they were captured. And in fact, um, Solzhenitsyn says when we captured them, we shot them in as soon as the first intelligible Russian word came from their mouths. The just straight up. That's what we're doing. Oh, you speak Russian. Cool. That means your blast off, man. You're done.

Speaker 1:          01:00:51       The term of [inaudible] in our country has the same force as the word sewage. We feel we are during our mouths merely by pronouncing it and therefore no one deers dares otter. A sentence with Velocify right in its subject. But that is no way to write history. Now a quarter century later when most of them had perished and camps and those who have survived or living out their lives in the far north. I would like to issue a reminder through these pages that this was a phenomenon totally unheard of in hauled the whole history of the world, that several hundred thousand young men age 20 to 30 took up arms against their father land as allies of its most evil enemy.

Speaker 2:          01:01:37       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:01:37       right. Seeing this never happened. Hundreds of thousands of, there was hundreds of thousands. These flies off troops, hundreds of thousands of them. How do you get a hundreds of thousands of men who are in the military like, okay, we get a traitor, we get five traders, hundreds of thousands, and he says back to the book, perhaps there was something to ponder here who was more to blame those youths or the gray fatherland one cannot explain this trees and biologically it had to have had a social cause because as the old proverb said, well fed horses don't rampage then picture yourself a field in which starved, neglected, crazed horses are rampaging back and forth. Continuing on.

Speaker 2:          01:02:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:38       There is a simple truth which one can learn only through suffering in war. Not Victories are blessed, but defeats governments need victories and the people need defeats. Victory gives rise to the desire for more victories. But after defeat, it is freedom that men desire and usually attain a people needs defeat. Just as an individual needs suffering and misfortune, they compel the deepening of the inner life and generate a spiritual upsurge. That's an interesting concept. I mean that's uh, that's what Joe Rogan talking about. You need to have some struggle, right? You need to have something to get after. Yeah. And, and Solzhenitsyn, sane people in a country need that same thing. We need that struggle. They want that struggle. And this is again, this is the one we spent a little bit of time on with Jordan and this is when, when one of Social Knutson's, uh, friends in the prison

Speaker 1:          01:03:55       Valentyn said, oh, they were expecting amnesty. There was expecting to be set free. And here we go back to, because we dried ourselves off balance and said to me reassuringly intimately, well, all right, we're still young. We're going to live a long time yet the main thing is not to make a misstep. Now we are going to a camp and will not say one word to anything so they won't plaster new terms in us. We'll work honestly and keep our mouth shut. And he really believed in his program, that naive little kernel of grain of caught between stound Stalin's millstones. He really had his hopes set on it and then he's talking about amnesty one wanted to agree with them to serve out the term Causley and then expunge from one's head what one had lived through. But I had begun to sense a truth inside myself. If in order to live it is necessary not to live, then what's it's off of then what does it all for? And of course Jordan and I got an a bigger long discussion about playing the game. And yeah, I mean I think we, uh, both agreed that there's times where you have to play the game a little bit. Yeah. And if you don't, well you'll end up in a worse position. Yeah. So we started talking a little bit about these kangaroo courts that went on.

Speaker 1:          01:05:22       And here's one of the judges makes the statement, we are not guided by laws but by our revolutionary conscience. So what does that mean? That means we just make up whatever the hell we want to make up. Yeah, whatever we're going to make up, that's what we're going to do. Um, and in, in this book book part one of volume one, he spends a lot of time talking about these multiple cases. He goes through, basically it's like court dramas and he spells them out pretty good. I mean, there's like a dialogue back and forth between the accuser and, and the defendants and you know, the uproar from the crowd and it's, it's like, uh, it's like multiple court dramas. One of them, um, the Moscow church trial, April 26th to May 7th, 1922, there were 17 defendants including arch priests and Laymen Accused of disseminating the Patriarchs proclamation. The charge was more important than the question of surrendering or not surrendering church valuables. And the presiding judge says, do you consider the state's law obligate Tory or not? And the Patriarch says, yes. I recognize them to the extent that they do not contradicts, contradicts the rules of peer piety, Comrade Beck. The presiding judge was astounded, which in the last analysis is more important to you? The laws of the church or the point of view of the Soviet government getting, this is all spelled out,

Speaker 1:          01:06:59       but it ends up May 7th the sentence was pronounced of the 17 defendants, 11 war to be shot.

Speaker 2:          01:07:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:13       Another massive show trial against the engineers that were, again, this goes back to the idea that they were considered wreckers and they had these massive show trials and here were some of the results of the show trials where they are, where they sentence these guys to massive prison terms or sentence him to death. Thus it was attained with eight horse traction. All the goals of the trial. One. All the shortages in the country, including famine, cold lack of clothing, chaos, an obvious stupidities we're all blamed on the engineer wreckers to the people were terrified by the threat of imminent intervention from abroad and were therefore prepared for new sacrifices. Three leftist circles in the west were warned of the intrigues of their governments and for the solidarity of the engineers was destroyed. All the intelligentsia was given a good scare and left divided within itself.

Speaker 2:          01:08:11       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:08:14       Every of these show trials.

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       Well, if it wasn't for the fact that people were being imprisoned or executed after the show trials, hmm. It would be a lot of them. They seem like kangaroo courts. They seemed comical when you read them.

Speaker 1:          01:08:33       Next chapter called the supreme measure, which is about capital punishment. Capital punishment has an up and down history in Russia in the 20 central provinces of Russia. In a period of 16 months from June, 1918 to October, 1919 more than 6,000 persons were shot, which is to say more than 1000 per month. The Revolution had hastened to rename everything so that everything would seem new. Thus the death penalty was rechristened as the supreme measure. No longer a punishment, but a means of social defense.

Speaker 1:          01:09:22       So they're executing a lot of people, of course they're calling it the supreme measure and they they, they, they refer to as social defense. Like we're just of how you were just defending ourselves right back to the book. And what kind of evil doers with these condemned men's wear did? So many plotters and troublemakers come from among them. For example, we're six collective farmers who are guilty of the following crime. After they had finished mowing the collective farm along with their own hands, they had gone back and mowed a second time along the hummocks to get a little hay for their own cows. The all Russian at Central Executive Committee refuse to pardon all six of these peasants and sentence. And the sentence of execution was carried out even if Stalin had killed no others. I believe he deserved to be drawn and quartered just for the lies lives of those six peasants. So there you go. You already harvested all the grain you can and then you go out, you do another run to get a little bit, hey for your own cows and they kill you. During those two years of 1937 and 1938 a half million political prisoners had been shot throughout the Soviet Union and 480,000 habitual fees in addition. So we're talking execution on just a mass scale that's two years. 1 million just rattled off a million.

Speaker 2:          01:11:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:11:10       Back to the book. And almost always a person obediently allows

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       himself to be killed.

Speaker 2:          01:11:16       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:11:17       Why is it that the death penalty has such a hypnotic effect? Those pardoned recall hardly anyone in their cell who offered any resistance. Does hope lend strength or does it weaken a man?

Speaker 4:          01:11:39       That's a good question, isn't it? It does hope lend strength or does it weaken a man? You had a talk that I witnessed recently and you mentioned this, something you just sorta mentioned for the first time that I heard where you were talking about hell week when you said that they'd say, hey, you know, you don't get much sleep. Right. And they say, okay, now we're going to give you guys a break. You know, six hours sleep. Yeah, yeah, no, they'd say something like, Hey look, your hell week has been extra hard and we went too hard on you by accident and the water was colder than normal. So what we're gonna do is we're going to give you guys, we don't normally do this, we're going to give you guys an eight hour recovery period. It's so go, go put on warm clothes. You know you're going to go in the barracks, you're not going to go in the tense.

Speaker 4:          01:12:28       You're going to go in your barracks putting a war, put on your dry clothes and getting your beds and you guys are waking up at eight hours. Yeah, but we need to do a little training pause right now. And then, and then they put you in, did they do it? And then they put you in there and you get all dry and then they put you on your bed and you're all my sounds. And then 20 minutes later they come in with machine guns and they wake you up and say, go get this. Or if again, and they do. And that's one of the things that gets a lot of people to quit. Yeah. It's a lot of people to quit. Right. So that's kind of the point where, yeah, the hope can Jim Ula? Oh yeah. Where that hope, you know like, oh, I can't believe in the one it's taken away from you real quick or something like that. Oh yeah. Well this is a great question because think if, okay, if you're in a situation where you could live or die, right. There's times where, hey, if I'm going to die, it makes me stronger. Like, Hey, I'm going to go out hardly ever. Yeah, exactly right. But also like if I can hope I can live, then that can make you like a fucking fight a little bit longer if I hope of survival. Yeah. So there's hope.

Speaker 2:          01:13:33       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:13:33       Lends strength or does it weaken Amanda and there's different cases where it does different things to you? Yeah. Depends on what kind of strength to, I feel like, yeah, I dunno. Hope of what to do. Like for sure of life is different. Life and death because death, that's the end of everything. That's like, you know, but like, yeah, but think about this situation you're, this is talking about death. Like you're going to be executed. So let me ask you this. So you're going to be executed. But there's, if there's a little bit of hope that, oh, maybe the sentence will get overturned or maybe I'll get pushed down the road. Or maybe they'll do an amnesty and I'll get out. That's hope, right? Yeah. So that might weaken you, right? Because if you're like, look, I'm getting executed and I don't care. And you know what, when that guard comes in here, it's hot.

Speaker 4:          01:14:17       Get some of my buddies and we're going to get after it. Oh yeah. Right. So that's going to make you stronger. So hope might not necessarily be a good thing. I mean, you know, if you ever encountered someone that had no hope, they can be very scary individuals because they don't care if they live or die. They don't got nothing to lose and nothing to lose, nothing to lose. You ever see a sports game where it can go like, like a, a team gets a good lead and then they just start taking risks and they start dominating, right? Yeah. I mean it can happen where they can start getting cocky, but like, uh, you can see a sports game where it happens in fights. It happens in MMA fights that I started getting the upper hand. It happens in Jujitsu. I started getting the upper hand.

Speaker 4:          01:15:00       I take a little bit more risk, but the risk, as long as the risk pay off that Nelson and you're, if you and I are rolling, I take a little risk like I up for the takedown. Right? I'm feeling cocky. Go for the take down. I get the take down right now all of a sudden your, your, your hope those down. Right. And mine's going up more and more. Yeah. But if you're really tired and the rounds almost over and you already lost and now you're just like, well, I got no hope, I'm just going to try for an arm lock. You might get it. Yeah. Yeah. And that's what I was going to say too. It's like, man, it's the on both sides. So it just depends. Both really the answer is well, because like look, MMA analogy, good one in my opinion to where let's say I'm down as a football team as a whatever, and you start throwing hail, Mary's doing that kind of stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:15:47       You know, it's like you have kind of less hope we're going to lose anyway. Nothing to lose situation. So it does give you strength in that way. But at the same time, if you way ahead, yeah, I can take more risks. I'll put my second string guys in there, give them some reps, whatever. Cause if you know, if the, if the risk does it pay off of whatever, we're still ahead so we're, you know, man, I don't know. Yeah. It just depends. You know what? I think the, the thing is here, you got to pay attention as a human to what the hope is doing to you. Right. It just gives us a good lesson learned to what is the hope doing? Cause it happens in your life too, right? Like maybe or like had a job and you're like, well I might get that promotion so I'm just going to stick it out.

Speaker 4:          01:16:25       I'm just gonna stick it out a little bit longer and then the butt. Whereas if you're like, hey, you're not getting promoted, you'd be like, all right and you don't want to do is I'm gonna get my resume together, I'm going to get my act together and I put that word. If you have hope, it makes you a little weaker. Yeah. So you've got to pay attention to it. But it could make you stronger though. It'd be like, oh, I might get the promotion so I'm going to, I'm going to work hard. You gotta pay attention to where hope is doing to you. That's what you gotta do. Hope isn't always good. It's not bad. It was not good. You got figure out, you got to monitor your hope. Don't get your hopes up. You know like that. Could you hope you had a monitor? That whole fit their monitor your hope. There you go. That continues on. Here we go. If the condemned men and every sale had ganged up on the as they came in

Speaker 1:          01:17:09       and and choked them, wouldn't this have ended executioners sooner than the appeals to the all Russian central executive committee when one is already on the edge of the grave? Why not resist, but wasn't everything for doomed anyway from the moment of arrest. Yet all the arrested crawled along the path of hope on their knees as if their legs had been amputated.

Speaker 1:          01:17:41       Monitor your hope wanted it. Oh, he describes sort of death row. In one of the prisons, there were four death cells in this prison in the same corridor as the juvenile cells and the hospital's cells. The death cells had two doors, the customary wooden door with a people and door made of iron grading. Each door had two locks and one jailer had the block supervisor. Each had a key one jailer and of the blocks supervisor each had a key to a different one, so the doors could only be opened by the two together. Sell 43 was on the other side of a wall of the interrogators office. And at night, while the condemned men were waiting to be executed, their ears were tormented by the screams of prisoners. Being tortured.

Speaker 1:          01:18:44       Talks about the idea of hunger strikes, which they did some hunger strikes along the way from our experience in the past and our literature of the past. We have derived a naive faith in the power of a hunger strike. But the hunger strike is purely a moral weapon. It presupposes that the jailer has not entirely lost his conscience or that the jailer is afraid of public opinion. Only in such circumstances can it be effective. So yeah, the, the Soviet prison, I didn't care. Say whatever you want. We control the press. Oh, and by the way, you think I'm gonna feel guilty that you're starving. No one, not a lot of, oh, and by the way, if I do feel like I want to make you live, guess what? They did? Forced artificial feeding. This method was adapted without any question from the experience with wild animals in captivity. Artificial feeding has much in common with rape. And that's what it really is for big men hurled themselves on one week being in deprivate of its one interdiction. They only need to do it once and what happens to it next is not important. The of rape in hears in the violation of the victims will, it's not going to be the way you want it, but the bay, but the way I want it lie down and submit,

Speaker 1:          01:20:22       they pry open the mouth with a flat disk, then broadened the crack between the jaw and insert a tube, swallow it. And if you don't swallow it, they shove it down farther any way and then pour liquefied food right down the esophagus and then they massage the stomach to prevent the prisoner from resorting to vomiting.

Speaker 2:          01:20:45       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:20:45       the sensation is one of being morally defiled.

Speaker 2:          01:20:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:20:58       And this is, it's the, it's the closing of this part of the book. We no longer know the answer to the question. Is the soul of a person in the new type prison in the special purpose prison purified or does it parish once and for all? If the first thing you see each and every morning is the eyes of your cellmate who has gone insane, how then shall you save yourself during the coming day? And like I said, that's, I'll take that as a, as a spot to close out that part one of this book about the Gulag, and I think that is a question that we can ask ourselves all up.

Speaker 2:          01:22:19       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:22:20       in our current world, but how can we save ourselves every day? When you look around at the world when it looks sometimes like the world is going insane, when people are going crazy, you have to kind of work to save yourself everyday. You have to pull yourself back into sanity in back onto the path and not allow yourself to become a prisoner of your own personal gulag. And these gulags, these Soviet gulags, if you want to build your own personal gulag in your life, you do it the same way that the Soviets did it. You do it with lies, lies on top of lies. When the Soviets lied on top of lies to build these gulags and in your life, if you lie to yourself, if you allow that to happen and you put lies on top of lies, you will build yourself your own personal gulag.

Speaker 2:          01:23:51       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:23:52       So don't allow it. Don't lie to yourself.

Speaker 2:          01:24:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:24:04       And instead you keep yourself out of that prison. We keep yourself free by telling yourself the truth.

Speaker 1:          01:24:23       And I think that's all I've got for tonight. And I know Echo, you've got some the ways that we can kind of help keep ourselves free by staying on the path. Sure. On top of telling the truth on top of telling the truth, which is kind of the key, right? The key element. It's a key element for sure. I was still kind of tripping on the hope thing, you know, if that gives you strength or, or takes it from you. Right. That's how you put it or that's how he put it. Right. It takes it from you. I was, I was talking to Dakota. Yeah. The other night and we were talking about after the big event, we know where he lost his team and all that. And we just talked a little bit more detail about the, if you remember in the book, a few days later, he goes on another operation that's just as crazy or maybe not just as crazy, but it's like it's really bad.

Speaker 1:          01:25:25       Yeah. And he was doing some definitely some, some crazy things and putting, what's the military term that we say he was going above and beyond the call of duty and putting himself at great risk. And I said to him, you know, we were, we were kind of like lab, you know, Dakota is so good to go and so awesome. And we were just like laughing. And I was like, well, you didn't see, I mean, at that point I'm like, you just, you know, you lost your whole team. I go, you didn't care if you lived or died. He goes, naughty. Not at all. Yeah. And

Speaker 4:          01:26:05       so when that situation that he had no hope at that moment in time. Right. And guess what he did? Whatever he had to do. He's like, Oh, I've got to go save the, I'm going to go run across open field where there's machine gun fire coming. Cool. I'll go, oh wait new dude again. I'll go again. Oh I need to do it again. I'll go again. Yeah. Cause he didn't have hope. And in fact that he didn't have hope. Gave him strength at that moment. Yeah. You know, at that moment. But if you talk to them now it's for versed. He's got his kids, got his little daughters, you know what I mean? He's got like hope for the future. Yeah. And that's what makes me strong right now until keeps him strong. What's the formula? Right. And I mean it's, the formula is monitor your home.

Speaker 4:          01:26:49       That's the formula. And it depends on who you are, right. Because they consider yourself, let's say all hope is lost, you know, I gotta you know, go across, do all these crazy things above and beyond. I could be, if I have a different attitude, I could be like, why? Like why fight it kind of thing. That death, impending doom, you know, just kind of take its course kind of thing. Right. I mean, could complete disregard for his own safety. That's the, that's the phrase I was looking for. Complete disregard for his own safety. Yeah. But that's like a specific like approach, you know, that's it. Like a different attitude. You know, like some people they'll be like, oh, I'm gonna, you know, like I'm, I'm doomed anyway. So why fight it? And then right, like I'm doing, so just start swinging for the fence and check this out.

Speaker 4:          01:27:32       You could also be like, I hope I can make it out of here. So what I'm going to do is I'm just gonna hide right here. And you didn't do anything that's the same. This like the reverse. It's the reverse. So it's like, and then if, if you're in a bad situation and you're like, well, I hope I can make it. I've got hope that I can live through this situation, so I'm just going to get down. I'm just gonna hide. Get behind this little, you know, rock outcropping and hope this goes away. Right. Hope they don't see me. Hope. Hope. Hope, hope. Yeah, and that's the example of the home. Guess what happens when you do that? The enemy maneuvers on you and you'd get killed. Whereas if you go like, you know what, I'm going out, I have no hope I'm going to attack.

Speaker 4:          01:28:14       But by the way, the enemy who's hoping they can take you and hoping that you're going to stay there when you, when you do something that they didn't hope for, that's going to smack him in the face. But like if, but then on the reverse side of that, right, let's say you have a different attitude even though you have hope, right? If all is lost, do you think, but I have this little shred of hope so I'm just going to go throw a hail Mary that's hope really. Rather than just like cowering in the corner and dying or whatever. But you wouldn't be throwing a hail Mary unless that was the only way. Like that was your only hope. Shred of hope was the only, I'm saying like if you, that's what I'm saying. Like, if you have two different approaches, you know, monitor your hope at the end of the day, that's going to monitor your home on, got to make sure that what? Cause

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       there's, you gotta be careful too because sometimes you know, if you have no hope, right? If you out well, I have no hope so I'm just gonna cause you could do that, right? Let's say you're in a bad situation, a combat situation. Hey, I got no hope so I'm just going to lay here and like, I guess this is what you were saying. Oh yeah, I got no hope. So I'm just gonna lay here instead of, hey, I got no hope so I'm just going to go out in a blaze of glory. Let's get science. Yeah, go down swinging approach. So if you monitor it, you go, wait a second. I have no hope. Okay. I'm going to at least go out hard. I'm going to go get some at a minimum, right? I'm going to take some people with me, bad guys. We'll save some of my good guys if I can do that. Yeah, that's good. As opposed to, hey, there's no hope, we're doomed. Monitor your hope.

Speaker 3:          01:29:53       Remember that? Remember Shawshank redemption? Yes. I have seen that movie where he was like, Hey, the guy read Morgan Freeman. He's insane. Hey, don't be careful with that whole thing. It will drive you insane. Or something like that. Like if you hope you'll get out or you hope you're going to get part into whatever his situation was. So it's like, yeah, if you hope you'll get pardoned and you hold onto that hope, but you get let down, it will create, it will drive you insane. And if you don't have hope and not do what he's implying, if you don't have hope, you just said basically accept your imprisonment so you can focus on our concentrate unliving prison life. You know the way it needs to be lived, so to speak. Do the best you can there. Yeah. Like don't have these hopes so the outside cause it'll make you crazy. That could be decent advice in a situation like that. Yeah. One of those deals. Monitor your hope

Speaker 1:          01:30:44       is what he was saying. That's what he was saying. It's saying monitor your hope because right. If you have no hope, you can be like, well, I'm just gonna just gonna kill myself. Yeah, exactly. Right. Yeah, and I know you've got a monitor it in the prison. All right. And you got to make sure that you're not putting yourself in a personal prison. Yeah. Which I, which that to me, this idea, if you think about the bad situations in your life, most of them are predicated on you lying to yourself about something.

Speaker 3:          01:31:18       Yeah. Yeah. Your everyday ones for sure. Yeah. Right. Yeah. It's weird. Every time you, like you say something like that, how I always try to think of something rebuttal. You know? It's weird. I feel myself doing that, but yeah, no, you're right. Yeah. I think so

Speaker 1:          01:31:33       that you just tell these little lies lies on top of lies and, and what's what I think what happens with lies on top of lies is

Speaker 3:          01:31:43       they become easier and easier to believe. Oh yeah. Like once you believe one of your own lives, then you believe three, then you believe 10 then you believe a hundred. Yeah. You know what the feeling is, the feeling is you lie to yourself, right? And or you could, a lot of times lying to yourself isn't like, hey, I'm tall. When you're not taught, it's not that. It's like, it's more of a not admitting certain things. That's more what it is. You know? Like when you saw how you can say, he say, look, take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror. Right end. And don't lie to yourself. Right. So it's usually when you lie to yourself in the mirror, it's like, oh, I won't admit that I won't, I won't admit that to myself that I need this or I should get rid of this or whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:32:21       That's how the light comes. You know? It's a lie by omission. I think this look, then the more you do it, yeah. But then you, and then you lived to see another day. Whoa. It's a miracle. So it must kind of be true. It must not be that big of a deal. My whatever, you know, like donuts that I eat every morning for breakfast must not be, I'm still here for those arise. So it is so in, no one's bringing it up. No one's bringing it up to me kind of thing. So it's like it's not really, it's not like pulling at me that much. So it gets easier and easier to kind of, it's almost like sweeping it under the rug kind of thing. You know? Meanwhile that's festering and festering. Oh, she'd go to the doctor cholesterol so high or whatever. See what I'm saying?

Speaker 3:          01:33:01       That's how it'll jam. Ya'll don't lie to yourself, you know, what else is it? Prison being on bottom, stuck in your side, control in Jujitsu to prison. So, and here's the weird thing, when you, when he said that I, I did think of this where if I have, and it's, I don't even know if I'd call it hope. Like if I want to be out, like if I want to escape, not that I want to do the escape room or take escape type actions is just I don't want to be there all like it. Way less like a won't, I won't be able to deal with it as much as if I say, okay, I'm here. It's like accepting that I'm an insight control, you know, and I have to take action here. My hope is here, not outside there. See what I'm saying? You have to accept the situation that you're in.

Speaker 3:          01:33:53       You can't lie to yourself. Lie Little prison. Anyway. I think that's what Morgan Freeman was talking about by the way. Nonetheless we can site control. That's Jujitsu. Speaking of Jujitsu, you're going to need a geek if you're an in doing Jujitsu. Indeed. Yeah. We're on the path. We're talking about the path right now. Right. Support yourself in this way by saying in the path to starting. Do you too. If you haven't already. A lot of people starting to get to a lot more people started jujitsu getting popular, very popular and for good reason too. I mean shoot, so when you get a g and a rash guard get origin g no question. Oh, you don't want to agree with me. I agree with her. That's what I thought. Anyway. Origin, main.com origin main.com. It's the, I guess the look that I was giving you is sort of the fact that we just glossing over the fact that these geezer made 100% in America. Yeah, yeah. Maybe I should talk about the last time you did, you talked about the looms and all that stuff today you're just, Hey, the best ski so which

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       I guess that's cool. Yeah, they are. They are all is true for sure. 100% yeah and, and you know what, I'm a, I was just about to say this, but I remembered that I do talk about this all the time on air and off air. That it is cool. It kind of like how Pete guys, how they brought back like the actual making of the g for example. Like that's a thing now it's like cool. Now no one cared about how your g was stitched him and like no one cared about that stuff. Even if they knew the pearl competitions last time I was there was I got like legit explanation of things from Pete because Pete and I were just like, it's 10 o'clock at night. We've been working for eight days straight and we're just in there getting, and I'm asking him pointed questions about stuff about how this thing gets, you know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          01:35:48       Cause I want to understand it. Yeah. There's a lot of those guys that had to learn a lot of stuff. You can't even, it's, I think it's been five years, six years, the amount of information that had to be learned from nut, from no, from nothing. From nothing. No. From trial and error. It's a funny ass Pete. That code and stuff like you can't exhaust Pete who yeah, you see the twinkle in his eye. He wants to explain it. He's all halls concerned. Those boring you guys with it. Oh Man. Stay off to that for sure. But yeah, origin g a hundred percent origin rask guard 100% supplements too, by the way. And I wasn't not, I wouldn't call myself anti supplement. And I'm going to say that, but I wasn't into supplements that much before. Now I am. Because you know when you come across the one that actually works, that's the thing.

Speaker 4:          01:36:37       You know, plenty of people, there are plenty supplements. It's, they sorta rely, maybe not 100%, maybe 100%, but they rely on the placebo effect. So when you have supplements like these that actually work, you becoming supplement person. So if you want them got joint warfare for your joints, obviously Krill oil for your life, like leading your joints, joints in your just overall health discipline for when you got to get that workout and there's discipline drink and there's discipline. Go pills go, go. And then it was more, you hit some kind of mock scenario going on.

Speaker 4:          01:37:20       Technically it was warrior kitten monk's last night we go to, okay, there's this light show, Christmas lights Shill, right. Um, you know, the, you know, certain neighborhoods they'll have, I guess this one is like super famous, like shoot tracers. No, no, it's called the, I think Balardo I think it's called Balardo light show. It's like, you know, Christmas lights, this house, they do it for thing. It has a whole show and people, you know, so we go and you know, my wife, she likes the Christmas spirit. Get all cozy, right? It's kind of colder now, California. Cool. Dig It. No offense, no offense. Iowa, no friends. Main, yeah, no offense. But California cold, we'll say you can see your breath. You're talking 40 49 degrees anyway, so like in, in like Michigan or Minnesota. It's 54 below in Montana it's 54 below zero. So anyways, continue a little bit different.

Speaker 4:          01:38:25       Sure. But still, but for the Charles Families Warrior Little Chili or according to my wife at warranted, maybe a hot chocolate scenario. So look, this is what we're going to do, driver, it's kind of close to miles who drive around. We're gonna look at all the nice lights. We'll drink our hot chocolate and the car would bring the kids. It'd be fun if we can get out. So everyone's busted out their hot chocolate. Of course. What, what do you think my hot chocolate was? Yeah. Oh, I know what. That's the warrior kid milk hot chocolate. I even put some whipped cream on it. Oh yeah. It was nice actually. It was surprisingly nice surprise. I was, this is why usually I drink the regular moke under different circumstances. It's like boom, milkshake, but home, you know. But you get the kid, consider this. Consider where I was. I had two, two kids and one wife, all with regular hot chocolate.

Speaker 4:          01:39:13       May or may not have had marshmallows in it. Either way. Regular hot chocolate and me I'm with, okay, I'm going to stick with the protein where your kids, so you didn't get, your kids didn't have native homie. That's, that's messed up. Here's the thing that to your kids, yeah, I was younger, I was Gunna, but we're kinda in a hurry and I made the game timeline. It was already made. I'm not going to be like, hey, there's no either way. Actually that's a good point. Next time. 100% nonetheless, I heat it up. It tastes the same. Literally tastes. This is freaking awesome. Same as regular hot chocolate. So anyways, that's warrior kid mall. You've got strawberry. And chocolate and then for, I had a guy at the gym the other day and he was, he's like, oh, I'm drinking some milk right now. And I was like, oh cool.

Speaker 4:          01:39:55       I was like, anybody hadn't know, like one of those metal water bottle, like a water bottle looking thing. And I go, what did you mix it with? And he's like, water. And I go, Bro, you got to, you got to get milk in there. And he goes, really? And I go, yeah, I go almond milk, coconut milk, one of the kinds of milks are their almond milk. I said, just get some acid or whole milk, just milk or skim milk, whatever. I saw him yesterday. He said, Bro, you're kidding. And I'm like, he was, no, I'm drinking it all the time. And I know. Yeah, I know. And he was actually telling me he liked it just as is with water, which I can't, I can't, I'm not going to make that claim because I don't believe it. Right. I'm not saying like, Hey, if you drink with water, it's going to be great or you drink with waters.

Speaker 4:          01:40:39       Okay. It's like, like I, like I said before, drink with water. It's like a ham sandwich. If you drink it with milk, it's like prime rib. Yeah, it's like a Ribeye. Sure. I didn't know what he was doing. I didn't know. I didn't know his exact scenario and I wasn't even there. I don't even know what you're talking to him. He's used to like drinking protein drink shakes in the shaker, you know off the live mix them want just throw it in with water or whatever. That's what he's forcing it down. Yeah. Yeah. That's what he's used to open it with it. Open your mouth, the ses gamma tube down your esophagus to get your protein. You don't need to do that with milk. There's no forced feeding. But that's what I'm saying. So now he mixed it. Same deal. Same routine, but now we've got the mock tastes better.

Speaker 4:          01:41:17       Cool. Puts it in. Oh yeah, you're right. Where's Jocko? Let me find them. You know, kind of thing. And you're like, Bro, you're not even on the, you are in the milk train fully. But man, you could be up here in first class. See what I'm saying? Rather than the in the caboose. Cool, man. Either way, just get on it and get all this stuff or didn't mean.com also web store. We have a store, Jocko, store.com this is where you can get more rash guards for Jujitsu approved. By the way, 100% approved. This is more, you know, representing the path directly in those rash guards. Anyway, some good rash guards on their shirts, shirts and hats, beanies, hoodies, legit hoodies and yeah, go to [inaudible] dot com you'll also Jocko white tea, which yes, he's at the, funny enough my wife is, she's on this there.

Speaker 4:          01:42:22       She'll even say I'm about to get after it. Right before she did. I guess this is why you can't create viral marketing, right? You can't be like, hey, let's come up with a viral thing for Jocko white tea. Hey, get on the Jocko white tea train. Like that doesn't work, I guess. Whereas most chain hundred percent trains Shoulda just formulated itself. That's what I mean. Yeah, you're right. It preexisted in some universe and then when it arrived here, it was like Choo Choo, get on a chuck anyway. Jocko white tea. Yes. Deadlift 8,000 pounds, whatever. I've been dead lifting 8,000 pounds for a long time already. So that is less exciting then it's going to be for the, you know the people who just start just saying, but yeah, sure. Somebody asking you could dead lift 1600 pounds if he, if you drink two cans, now you just want to say this, but uh, no, it doesn't work.

Speaker 4:          01:43:19       That doesn't work that way. Yeah, no, exactly right. Exactly right. Nonetheless, in Cannes and in, what do you call it? Dry Tea. Prefer the cans personally, but the dry, it tastes good too. For sure. Available on Amazon and at the chocolate store, right? Yes sir. Dot Com. Yeah. Cool. Everywhere. Just go on line Jocko. White tea. Boom. Right in your mailbox. Also subscribe to the podcast. If you haven't already on Google and wherever play whenever you get Pi. Hey, check out the warrior kid podcast. If you've got kids or even if you don't have kids, if you know kids get in the warrior kid podcast, I have a couple more episodes coming out this week of the warrior kid podcasts so you can get some of that. Also you can get that warrior kids soap from Irish oaks ranch made by an actual warrior kid named Aiden who makes it with goat milk.

Speaker 4:          01:44:10       Yeah. So if you want to get some soap so that you can follow his motto, which is stay clean and then youtube, subscribe to youtube if you want to see what Echo Charles looks like. It's true. If you want to see what a guest looks like, if you want to see the look on [inaudible] face, when I say something that he doesn't agree with or if you want to see the look on my face when he says something, uh, that was one of the funniest outtakes was you talking and then you, but you were just showing my face just like so bored and annoyed and yes, there is a few of those. There's one where I was talking about justifying like not doing squats or whatever and you're just like this. I thought the funny thing was already you're talking about, so I'm going to an alien thing and I just showed my face and I'm just looking at me like, please get the hint that my face right now means stop, but you are actually really nice about that.

Speaker 4:          01:45:13       I'm are generally nice, pretty nice person. Well, sometimes you take advantage of that with stories that impinge on my whole situation anyway, psychological warfare, which that's what that is by the way, when you're just looking at me, nothing like that. Just looking like it's psychological. It's psychological communication. Anyway, the real psychological warfare is an album with tracks of Jocko on each track telling you how to overcome your moments of weakness. That may may creep in t your whole scenario in life when you're on the path, you can get that on iTunes, Google play, MP, three platforms or whatever. You know what I said we were going to get psychological warfare to out by Christmas, not going to happen. Little delay. If you still have some requests of a, of an area of weakness and you want us to make a psychological warfare tracks and you can crush and destroy that weakness, then just let us know the uh, you know, the usual means yes. Yeah. Online. Cool. Yeah. All your excuses are lies by the way. That's the working title. Also very up your work though. I was going to do a video today. We'll work up video of yourself. Yup. Cool. And I was going to do a kettle bell typical kettlebells scenario and I was just going to start doing curls with it, but, but I decided against it because it's kind of disrespectful to the, got a good idea. You should do a workout video where you just have a barbell Kettlebell Dumbbell, uh, uh, a sandbag and everything.

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       You just don't girls essentially the idea, but it was kind of disrespectful. Anyway, my point there being, what it reminded me of of it is that the crow, it was going to be like really good like produced video. Not necessarily with a good camera, nothing like that, but just like, I'm just going to frame it good and it was good. It was going to be using the Onnit, kettle bell, the cyclops, whatever. Nonetheless decided against it because it's going to be kind of disrespectful because that's not what kettle bells for obviously, but if you do get kettlebells, even if it's funny, it's still disrespectful. I have to what it felt like at the time, but no, you're probably right. I the time I was like, yeah, it'd be all right. Yes. Anyway, my point is even those little bit beside the point, it reminded me of it.

Speaker 3:          01:47:33       The point is, my new point is when you want to vary up your workout curls or otherwise, some people, they don't even do curls. I used to do curls. You see, do curls to don't act like you know. No, I do. I do. Go, boom. Get your stuff from on [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko by the way, kettle bells rings. These are things that not only do I do pretty much every workout pretty much, but this is, these are ones that I strongly recommend to incorporate rings. And this last stuff you can do on rings by the way, the pushups pull ups and uh, the planks or whatever, those big ups dips. Yeah. I don't do them as much, but the planks for sure. You don't do dips? Not on the rings. No. Why? I Dunno. I just don't. Okay, let's do them on the bar nonetheless. Good job. These are Dang Bro. That was a lot of heat right there for, for no dips on the rings anyway. Get them out on it. Good stuff on there. Very up to workout. Incorporate new things in the workout. Yeah man, it's good.

Speaker 1:          01:48:35       Mikey and the dragons is out. It is in stock fully. I'm sorry that it took a little eight. Everyone should have gotten it by or should get it by Christmas. If you ordered it reasonably before Christmas, you should have it because we, we made it, we did it. Everyone that ordered it, we got an Amazon fulfilled, so appreciate everyone that ordered it. It is now fully in stock. We should not run out again family. If you have Amazon prime, that's like two days, right? Yeah. I Dunno. I Dunno. Yeah. I Dunno when they're cut off time is for Amazon to get it shipped in time. But yeah. Um, those are in the distribution centers around the country with Amazon prime right now. So if you haven't gotten Mikey in the dragons for every kid that you know, then you can get it done right now. We got a lot of copies ready to roll. So get it for your kids, get it for your neighbor's kids, get it for your library, whatever. You can also get the way of the warrior kid books way the warrior kid and Mark's mission. If you want your kids or kids, you know, to actually have a good life, this is a great way to start them off actually having a good life. Yes. Another, this is a holiday gift. If there ever one

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       was one discipline equals freedom. Feel better. I need to post that video actually a post that video repost. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Get that video posted. But yeah, because that's a good gift to give to anyone that needs to be on the pros in the morning. If you want to get the audio version of that, it's not on audible, it's on iTunes, Amazon music, Google play, et cetera. Extreme ownership of course, dichotomy of leadership, possibly better than extreme ownership. I've gotten like four last four people I talk to. I was like, ah, possibly. And they're like, no, it's definitely better. And that's kind of weird, right? Yes. Is that, yeah, well, [inaudible] go flare up. You know what I mean? Maybe, but I don't really get that from what you just said right now I, here's my hypothesis that people who were, who were saying that dichotomy, leadership is better than extreme ownership, better than extreme ownership or people who read extreme ownership and then we're like, yeah, you know, hell yeah, I'm going to extreme ownership.

Speaker 4:          01:50:47       And then they go in and they're like, okay. It's like, you know, I made the analogy of the guy on major league, right? The picture. He had all this power, but he didn't have any control. Dichotomy of leadership comes in, gives them that control that they wish that they had. Yeah. They didn't even know they didn't have it. They didn't know they didn't have it. They thought the extra mile to a mile thing. A seal buddy of mine came over to my house the other day and he brought 20 copies of extreme ownership. His wife wanted to give his, giving them to her team in the company and he goes, yeah, you know, I'm giving, you know, my wife really wants to give him, and she's read it. She loves it. And then he goes, but she's kind of a bull in a China shop. Yes. And I was like, okay, cool.

Speaker 4:          01:51:37       So I guess what I did, I was like, Hey, let me give a little something for your wife's Christmas present, giving her a little Christmas present. Yep. We have a little something called dichotomy of leadership because that's the situation you're talking about. Oh, you know what though, it's the perfect situation. Like you think, oh, I'm going to go take ownership. And it's like, well, or even like everyone's going to read this book, it's, I'm dichotomy of leadership. Let's make sure we're balanced. Yeah. Actually though, you know what, you know what I just thought of right now? I gotta I gotta take it back. Maybe, maybe not. Maybe I'm right. Maybe I'm not with that whole analogy. But you know what though? What's more important? Power or bow or, or, or what do you call accuracy or whatever. Right? Cause it's Kinda the same thing. Extreme ownership is like, oh, here's what you do.

Speaker 4:          01:52:18       Full speed. This is what you do. And then the dichotomy is kind of the control element. What's more important? Control or speed. See what I'm saying? Controller. [inaudible] controller. They're both important. I think so too. Yeah. At the end of the day, that's, I think that's the scenario though. You won't have, you won't have anything to balance if you don't understand the fundamental principles of combat leadership. Right? So you got to have the balance and Justin's gotta be, yeah. So get those books. Good Christmas presents. Or I'm the worst gift giver. Eh, you're not very good for you. Let me take that back. If I get you a gift, which is not likely. Yeah, it'll be great, but it's a slim chance. You're getting one. Well, how many gifts have you gotten from me to what I give you? Well one actually a technical I don't think was from you.

Speaker 4:          01:53:08       You gave me a copy of the discipline equals freedom field manual signed or like on your own. Like it wasn't like, Hey, give me, you are like, hey, you know this is for you. Go. That was cool. What else? Nice. That's cool. Cause I've written six books. I'm giving you one. There you go. You're batting or about average. Only 20% of the time. My daughter one. That's, you're exactly right. Not me with different, no, you gave me something. I think it was like a shirt or something. Then I found out like later that day that it wasn't from you. You're just a message that was given to you. One gift. Thanks for that by the way. Check. Ah, also we've got an echelon front. That's my leadership consultancy and what we do is go into companies and uh, solve problems through leadership. Go to echelon, front.com if you want to work with me and my team, which is Leif Babin, JP Denelle, Dave Burke, Flynn Cochran, Mike's Raleigh and Mike [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          01:54:09       Also, we got the monster coming up. It is live for registration right now. Chicago, Denver and Sydney Australia. Go to extreme ownership.com right now if you want to come, they've all sold out. This one is going to actually we opened registration. It's already like these are going to sell a lot faster for whatever reason. Yeah. Interesting. How your we're going to Australia. Yeah. Cause a lot of people were saying, you know, if for some reason I didn't, I went to Brisbane, Australia and I did a book signing in Brisbane, Australia and I announced it on like a Wednesday or a Thursday and the book signing was on Friday and I showed up and there was hundreds and hundreds of people there. Um, yeah, I was super stoked about that and it showed that there was a lot of people that we're supporting and of course we've got e f Overwatch, which is us connecting proven leaders from Spec ops and combat aviation communities with companies in the civilian sector that need experienced leaders to step up and lead inside their organizations to go to eff Overwatch and fill out the information there either as a talent seeker or a career seeker.

Speaker 4:          01:55:16       We're waiting to link you guys up. You know, speaking of events, we are doing a live event. We are doing a live event, New York City January 9th details to be announced.

Kibo hop echo is that Echo Charles and I am at Jocko Willink and thanks to all the military personnel out there that are providing us with this way of life and you can see how bad life can get when you read a book like the Gulag Archipelago. Also, thanks to police and law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics, EMT is correctional officer's border patrol and all first responders have for protecting this way of life that we have here at home. And to everyone else out there, just remember that this nightmare of the gulags started when people can't quiet on a large scale and on a small scale. Don't let that happen on a large scale and don't let it happen to you.

Speaker 2:          01:57:10       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:57:11       Resist that whole opening chapter about not resisting. Don't let that happen. Resist, resist the weakness, resist the lies, resist the things in your life that will turn you into a prisoner and into a slave. And you'd do that by going out there every day and getting after it.

Speaker 2:          01:57:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:57:41       And until next time, this is echo and Jocko
