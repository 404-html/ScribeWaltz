Speaker 1:          00:01          This is Jocko podcast number one 22 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening and if you have not listened to episode one 21 the previous episode to this one, go listen to it before listening to this web episode or even the next episode. They are all linked together and that's why we released them all at the same time. This episode picks up where the last episode left off. This episode is about the story of chesty puller son Louis B polar junior and we will be learning about Lou polar junior from his audio autobiography which is entitled Fortunate Son. It is a Pulitzer Prize winning book about his life growing up with his father and his experiences when he joined the Marine Corps, served as a platoon commander in Vietnam and about his life upon his return from the war and the struggles that he faced.

Speaker 2:          01:26          Let's go to the book.

Speaker 1:          01:29          I first noticed my father's tattoo this summer. He returned from the Korean War. We had just moved from Virginia to the Marine base at Camp Pendleton. California. Mother had asked me to awaken him from an afternoon nap and as I entered their bedroom and stood beside his sleeping figure, my eyes were drawn to the Blue Globe and its anchor on his right upper arm. When I extended my hand to trace the outline with my finger, he awakened and acquiesce and acquiescing to the curiosity of a five year old. He playfully flexed his bicep and tussled my hair with his free left hand. I had no idea that the object of my fascination was the emblem of the Marine Corps, the organization to which my father had already dedicated more than 30 of his 53 years. I did know that it must be important because my mother had a piece of gold and silver jewelry in the shape of my father's tattoo and she wore at frequently when she got dressed up.

Speaker 1:          02:31          Later I learned that mother loved the Golden Silver Pin and despised the tattoo. There were other things I noticed about my father and the summer and fall of 1951 a time during which he made a special effort to be accessible to his only son and to make up for his absence during the war. My father had been promoted to the rank of brigadier general after leading the First Marine regiment of the First Marine Division in the retreat from the chosen reservoir through Cotu re just before Christmas 1950 the breakout came to be regarded as a classic in the annals of modern military modern American military warfare for his role in holding together the rear guard during some of the bloodiest fighting of the war. My father was recognized for his heroic leadership and his elevation to flag rank was assured

Speaker 1:          03:25          after the engagement ended. Mother told me father had escaped from a trap set by the red Chinese, but I could not envision his being caught in a device similar to the one I baited with lettuce and the apple orchard behind my grandmother's home in Virginia where we waited out the war. He had sent me warm a mentos to Korean swords and enemy helmet and Bugle and several metals which arrived in silk lined blue boxes, affectionately known among his beloved Marines as the old man or chesty for the way he carried himself when marching. He must have known that combat taking place on the frozen waste waste in ridges of Korea would be his last and even then he was passing on to me the proud traditions of his profession. For my sixth birthday, near the end of the summer, he gave me a 22 caliber single shot rifle, which he had modified by sawing the stock and half to accommodate my narrow shoulders and short arms on the butt. He had stencilled my name Louis be polar jr and added the end. The added touch filled me with pride of ownership and a certainty that I had the best father in the world.

Speaker 1:          04:41          After we had practiced on paper targets and tin cans, he took me into the Brown hills around our home in search of California Jack Rabbits. At first I struggled to matches long legged gate, but after he realized that I could not keep up, he slowed his pace and began circumventing the steeper hills. Even then I tired easily and my aching legs diverted my attention from our elusive quarry throughout the several months that we hunted together and Camp Pendleton countryside. I never once came close to hitting a rabbit, but my father puffed silently on his pipe pipe each time I missed. And on those occasions when he bagged game, I was allowed to carry our trophies. The last hundred yards back home

Speaker 1:          05:29          in early February is my twin sister. Martha and I were beginning of the second half, half of our first year of grade school and our older sister, Virginia was seemingly an adult sixth grader. A parade was held to honor my father's heroism at the chosen reservoir. I was permitted to go along with mother and she held my hand as we stood at the end of a sun drenched parade ground and waited for the ceremony to end when the last drum beat sounded and the standard bearers had retired. The colors. My father's strode from the field on which he had just been honored and knelt briefly to let me view the object of the mornings. Pageantry a gold star in lieu of his fifth navy cross, the most ever earned by any one marine and our country sank second highest award for valor now joined the panoply of ribbons that covered most of his left chest. The moment of that frozen instant more than three decades ago is this fresh and firmly fixed in my mind today as any of my most vivid boy had boyhood recollections.

Speaker 3:          06:35          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:36          At Camp Pendleton, father commanded the third marine brigade and was charged with training fresh troops for the denouncement being played out along the 38th parallel in Korea.

Speaker 1:          06:50          On several occasions, he and his dream driver, Sergeant Orville Jones took me with them to observe war games and field exercises in Pendleton Scrub, dotted boondocks. I was naturally fascinated by the maneuvers of khaki clad marines and the smoke and funder of mock warfare. So it's, it's a beautiful picture. It's a beautiful picture and he's home from war. Luckily they must have had their kids pretty late because he's young and you know, chestie's I think 45 at this point or something like that. 45 or 46 so had the kid had at least Lou Louis Junior when he was, I don't know, 40 or something like that. And this is like a, every kids you know would be stoked on this dad. And you know, I know when my, when my son was like this age, I would bring him sometimes to our training sites and he would,

Speaker 3:          07:53          yeah,

Speaker 1:          07:53          shoot machine guns and grenades and stuff like that. And he'd watch all the maneuvers. Sorry, these, let me tell you. Six year old boys, they like that kind of thing. I promise you. All right. Back to the book. In August, 1953 when the crew with the Korean War ended, father was promoted to major general and the sign in front in our front yard was repainted to reflect as new rank. We had to mute our celebration because the general who lived across the street was not selected for promotion, but all in all times were good in our lives. We're happy father had sufficiently decompressed from his Korean War experience that he was no longer making the kinds of inflammatory statements about the conduct of the war that had gotten him just him into so much trouble in the past, including one that haunted him for years to the effect that whiskey and beer would make troops fight better than ice cream and soft training. The promotion to major general was proof that he was on track toward at least a possible shot at becoming commandant of the Marine Corps and fulfilling a lifelong ambition. So the commandant of the Marine Corps is the senior ranking marine and

Speaker 2:          09:04          that's, I guess

Speaker 1:          09:06          obviously his goal or was his goal.

Speaker 2:          09:12          All right.

Speaker 1:          09:15          He was ordered by the commandant. Now, you know, I covered some of this and in the first book, but he was ordered by the commandant of the Marine Corps to report to Bethesda, Maryland, Maryland naval hospital for further evaluation. After two weeks in the hospital, he was found unfit for duty and scheduled to go before retirement board. In early August. He returned home angry and bitter, and perhaps because he couldn't discuss the perceived unfairness of his situation with his fellow marines, he vented his frustrations on mother. He had felt from the time of his illness that a quartiere of senior officers in the Marine Corps was jealous of a celebrity and would use the stroke as a pretext to end his career. And that's what is not mentioned in the first book, is that it was a, it was a minor stroke that he had had. He viewed his summons to Bethesda after a board had already passed on his fitness report as part of a conspiracy to do him in and was even critical of the commandant of the Marine Corps.

Speaker 1:          10:15          I was never told what words passed between my father and the commandant while he was away from us in Bethesda, but given his father, but given father's outspokenness and his sense of injustice being done to him, I'm certain that they were less than cordial, general Lemieux Mule Sea Shepherd. The commandant had also been my godfather and prior to father's stroke, he regularly sent me birthday presence after father came back from Bethesda. I never received another gift or communication from my godfather and for years I did not understand if or why he had abandoned me. So I'm sure chesty I'm sure Jesse let let the common dot know what was up and what he thought about what's going on. So as we know from the first book marine, the life of chesty puller, that after he was retired from the marine corps, they went to two chestie's wife's hometown.

Speaker 1:          11:20          Here we go back to the book, the Sleepy Little Virginia town of Saluda. Although straddling a major north south thoroughfare was no more than a crossroads with a dozen or so small businesses and 50 or 60 houses. Had it not been my mother's birthplace, it would've seemed strange. It would have seemed to same strange setting for a man famous as my father to have picked to spend his retirement years. There was so little industry and so few business opportunities that most of the young men and women moved away as soon as they finish school and the inhabitants who remained were either old or unenthusiastic about moving on. Without a support staff, our lives become, became much less pampered and for the first time Martha and I were faced with household chores prior to father's retirement. I never made my own bed or shine my own shoes and now it was expected to help maintain a home.

Speaker 1:          12:13          There were times early on as I struggled beneath a load of firewood or rake leaves into a pile for burning when I thought what a downward turn of our fortunes had taken. Gradually, however, I began to take pride in my responsibilities and as the house and grounds began responding to our nurturing, I felt real accomplishment. We never talked about father's stroke after we moved to Saluda, but there was an unstated premise that he was unable to do any strenuous work around the house and I tried to step into the void. I puffed with pride to think that I was in a sense becoming the man of the house.

Speaker 2:          12:53          So little boys stepping it up. Now

Speaker 1:          13:02          as as in the first book we talked about the trial that took place in the end where the recruits were killed in and drowned and chesty puller was called to the witness stand from retirement to talk about Marine Corps training and this is when he comes back from that back to the book. We met him at the airport in Richmond when he returned home and I knew by the way, he constantly strode through the crowd of cameras, photographers and newsmen on his way to the car that he was pleased with his performance at Parris Island. Apparently most Americans agreed for in the weeks and months that followed, he received hundreds of phone calls, telegrams and letters praising him for coming to the defense of the Marine Corps. I realized then that bitter as he was for the way he saved himself to have been treated by the higher ups in the Marine Corps headquarters. He was incapable of sitting idly by while his beloved core was under attack. His testimony also reinforced the perception that he was a marine's marine who cared far more about the enlisted men than he did about high ranking officers.

Speaker 1:          14:13          We also hunted together as we had five years earlier in the hills of Camp Pendleton. By now having moved up from a 22 to a 12 gauge shotgun, I could easily keep up with my father as we stocked through the woodlands and open fields around Saluda looking for rabbits and squirrels in California. I had been amazed that my father could walk so fast and so far while I seem to always be out of breath or trying to ignore the woodiness in my legs now. However, as he neared 60 years of age and I was moving into adolescence, the roles were reversed and he was the one who needed frequent stops renew his strength. He still had a good eye and quick enough reflex is to be able to bring down a flushed quail are moving rabbit, but I was beginning to understand that when he paused to listen for game or check his bearings, he was really buying time against his encroaching against the encroachments of old age. So that's the way it is. That's the way of works.

Speaker 3:          15:18          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:19          Good manners were an element in our upbringing that mother and father considered important. I was taught early to stand when adult entered adults entered the room and help ladies out with their chairs or with car doors. We weren't, we never interrupted grownups and conversations and when addressing them we always ended our responses with sir or ma'am. Father taught me to squeeze a man's hand firmly when I shook hands and to look people straight in the eye when we were talking, he valued personal appearances and good grooming and until I left for college, I never went more than a few weeks without a haircut. When I was in seventh grade, he taught me how to tie a neck tie and from then on I was expected to be properly dressed in a coat and tie for special occasions.

Speaker 3:          16:00          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:00          I was equally aware of how I looked to others. In seventh grade, I was fitted for braces by an orthodontist in Richmond and on the way home in the car, my teeth hurt and I was depressed. I had gotten eyeglasses only a few months earlier to correct my near sightedness and the braces were coming so quickly after the glasses were more than my fragile psyche could handle. Father noticed my despondency and suggested that we stop on the outskirts of Richmond for cheeseburgers and ice cream. With my sore teeth, I could manage neither. So while mother and father were finishing their meal and the drug store where we just stopped, I wandered over to the magazine stand and began browsing. Before I had gotten two pages into the magazine, I had selected a burly white collar. Druggist appeared at my side, snatched the magazine from my hand, then began brow beating me for reading the magazine without paying for it.

Speaker 1:          16:56          I was totally bewildered by his attitude, but before I could retreat or apologize, I saw it at the corner of my eye that my father had risen from his booth and was advancing towards the druggist. His teeth were tightly clenched, as were his fists, and there was fire in his eyes as he came to rest with his face, not six inches from the drug lists. Before he spoke, I looked at my mother, who with her eyes closed in the vinyl booth, appeared to be praying and then I looked at the druggist who is at least 50 pounds heavier in 30 years younger than my father. Leave the boy alone, my father growled, growled, and a voice gone hard, or you and I can go outside and settle this for a moment. That drug has said nothing has his face blanched until it was the color of his color. Excuse sir, he finally stammered and then retreated to the safety of his cash register.

Speaker 3:          17:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:55          Mother had reacted as if she had seen my father behaves similarly on other occasions

Speaker 1:          18:09          at Christchurch, so this is where he went to school at Christ church. I threw myself into studies partly to compensate for not being a capable athlete. I did well academically and quickly gained a reputation as one of the bright boys. So in the book he talks about how you know he's just not not a great athlete and his sister is a better athlete than him and she kind of, it's his twin sister. She kind of does better and things, so he focuses on his academics. As I grew older, I began to sometime the sometimes painful process by which a son distances himself from his father and preparation for striking out on his own. I began to realize that my father, the man and my father, the legend, we're not always one and the same. The legend was all powerful, fearless in the face of any challenge or adversity and incapable of mistakes in judgment or unfairness in dealings with lesser mortals. The man, like most men approaching their twilight years was not as strong as he had once been. Occasionally showed signs of self doubt and made his share of errors when interacting with other people from the time I was a little boy, he had delighted in balling up his fists and playing and playfully going several rounds with me. He continued the game after I started high school, but by the time I was 15 or 16, my reflexes had become sharper than his and I became uncomfortable exchanging mock punches with him.

Speaker 3:          19:36          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:37          The, the, it's, it's interesting and I watched a few interviews with, with uh, Lou polar junior and he's not, it might sound my keys, um, being disparaging by saying there was the legend and then there was the real man, but he, it, he comes clear in the book. He's not being disparaging at all. He's, and he definitely, in some of the interviews I watched with them, he's explaining like, no, it's not a negative thing, it's just that everyone fought. Chesty Puller was this legendary thing, but it was the man that he knew as his dad and that man was more important in a better human being and all that. So he's not being disparaging by saying that there was a difference between the two. He's just be stating that there was a difference. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          20:26          Okay.

Speaker 1:          20:26          But as you know, as loopholes going through this rebellious stage, back to the book, I also began to be bothered by my fathers, by the waste of my father's considerable talent and an inordinate amount of time he spent on trivial undertakings.

Speaker 3:          20:41          Okay.

Speaker 1:          20:42          My father spent hours sitting at the dining room table playing solitaire or rereading books that he had owned for many years. Mother was busy running the House and raising Virginia, Martha and me. While there were days during which my father did nothing more than make an occasional trip to the corner store fetcher fetch the mail. He was easy to have around the house and was almost totally undemanding of his children. But it seemed to me that this living legend should have more important things to do than serve as an air board. Aaron boy. For my mother. I did not realize that the Marine Corps had been his whole life and that in committing himself so totally to its mission, he had never had the time for hobbies or other outside interests. I also did not see until I was much older that my father's stroke had taken a physical toll on him that he would never acknowledge. In the middle of my junior year in high school, my father awaken one night in intense pain and they took him to Portsmouth Naval Hospital. And on the way there, my father held tightly to my hand for most of the trip and I could tell that he was in agony. Although the only complaint was that he was not allowed to smoke in the ambulance.

Speaker 3:          21:59          Okay.

Speaker 1:          22:00          And when he returned home

Speaker 1:          22:05          a loophole or finally realized that he wanted to talk, and so now they're kind of, they kind of connect here for perhaps seven or eight days. In that winter of 1962 I was able to communicate with my father as I never had before. He told me that he was fearful about aging and the inevitable declining state of his health and about how he never wanted to be a burden to his family. I listened as best I could to an old man reveal feelings that he had never expressed before. He also told me that he was counting on me to carry on when he was gone and how proud he was to have a son to continue the polar name.

Speaker 3:          22:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          22:44          We did not talk about the military or my attempting to follow in his footsteps, but even then, there was some unstated assumptions about the course my life would take.

Speaker 1:          22:56          Several years earlier, shortly after his retirement, we had gone to the William w gone to Williamsburg for an outing and he had taken me to see a short film about the American Revolution called the story of a Patriot, which was shown continuously to tourists visiting the new information center. At the conclusion of the film, the main character watches a group of young men who have just enlisted to go fight the British and he swells with pride when he sees his son among the ranks. Of the newly enlisted, my father's enchantment. With that scene registered powerfully on my young psyche. And without ever saying another word, I knew that someday I would be enlisting in some as yet undetermined. Cause now five or six years later, I shared the dining table of our home with the man I loved, like no other in the world. I wanted desperately to be what he expected me to be. It took me years to realize that I could never hope to emulate the legend that was chesty puller.

Speaker 3:          23:56          Okay.

Speaker 1:          23:56          But I knew even then that I love the man far more than the legend.

Speaker 3:          24:04          Okay.

Speaker 1:          24:06          Oh sorry. Yeah, it's reality. It's life. And as I mentioned in the beginning of this whole thing, this a story about life. If you carry it through all stories about life and death, and you can see some deterioration starting to occur. Back to the book in the autumn of 1967 with the lengthening shadow of the Vietnam War, spreading a chill across America. I moved on from the carefree pursuits of undergraduate life at the College of William and Mary and join the Marine Corps like my father, who had enlisted 50 years earlier during the war to end all wars. I traveled from Rural Virginia to the Marine Corps recruiting station in nearby Richmond in search of something larger than myself. I had drifted through previous four years drinking beer and chasing girls with a singleness of purpose that belied my lack of meaningful direction. And now on the threshold of manhood and with war is a backdrop. I realized the time had come to put my frivolity aside. So obviously he goes to college, he gets done with college, and he says, I'm going in the Marine Corps. William and Mary in the months prior to my departure was still the sleepy southern campus who's quaintness at attracted me four years earlier. The carnage taking place in Southeast Asia had remained a distant and nonintrusive reality for all, but the most perceptive of us insulated as we were by youth and inexperience. So even with the Vietnam war going on, like they weren't even paying attention to it. Even even even loophole and wasn't paying attention to it.

Speaker 3:          25:46          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          25:47          There were, however signs of a more ominous nature. The networks had begun reporting the rising casualty tolls on the nightly news. I viewed the graduation that ended my student draft deferment and qualified me for the Marine Corps officer candidate program as an opportunity rather than a burden. As I entered the recruiter's office, I was acutely aware of the impact that my name would have on the sergeant whose duty would be to convince me of the golden opportunities that a hitch in the Marine Corps could provide.

Speaker 3:          26:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:17          The marine corps builds men. The decal sat on his office divider and I, in my youthful exuberance, never pause to consider that the core might do the opposite. When he realized who I was, the sergeant dispensed with his usual sales pitch and concentrated on the mechanics of becoming the recruiter who signed up chesty puller son, the recruiter, also telephone to Marine Corps in Washington DC to obtain a waiver for my poor eyesight and the authority on the other end of the line at first demurred but then act. We asked when he realized that if he stood from the core, would fail to sign up the son of its most famous marine because of a technicality.

Speaker 3:          27:00          Okay.

Speaker 1:          27:00          I returned to Saluda to await orders to Quantico for basic training. My older sister's husband, captain build the beat. Dabney was already serving a tour as a Marine infantry company commander in Vietnam and she too was back at home, sitting out our generation's initial venture into the war.

Speaker 3:          27:22          Okay?

Speaker 1:          27:22          After a childhood diet of Hemingway novels and John Wayne Movies, along with my father's ex Zamvil, I viewed my own prospects, if not with eagerness, at least with equanimity.

Speaker 3:          27:37          Okay?

Speaker 1:          27:37          The comradery of the fraternity. It talks about how he's in a fraternity and whatnot. One of these at college, the Camaraderie of the fraternity now seemed almost trivial and although I often drink myself to the point of oblivion, I could not escape the feeling that for me, the carefree celebrations of youth could not be recaptured. Of all my acquaintances, acquaintances at William and Mary, the only one had been touched by war for which I was headed. Brian Speer, the president of a neighboring fraternity, whose dreams of manhood I have been privileged to share and frequent late night bull sessions had preceded me into the marine corps and had been killed within months of his arrival in Vietnam. The previous June. His death saddened me and brought home the intimations of mortality with which most of my circle were blessedly unfamiliar

Speaker 1:          28:32          during this. You Remember Charlie Paul talking about when they are at the naval academy and they weren't even talking about Vietnam. It's crazy, isn't it? Yeah. Very similar, but it must've been, I guess they didn't have the 24 hour news cycles you have now in the Internet and the stories and the click bait and all that stuff going on and those things can be a little bit more isolated. Yeah, like you got to choose to follow it. Yeah. Yeah. You've got to help the story a little bit. During this waiting time, my father had remained characteristically closed mouth about my future in the Marine Corps. I, of course, knew that he was immensely proud of me for having chosen to follow his example, but a tacit understanding between us made words unnecessary. I felt an urgent and compelling need to prove myself worthy of his name and key in the twilight of his military career that spanned almost 40 years, wished that he could go in my stead.

Speaker 3:          29:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:30          As I said my goodbyes and prepared to leave for Quantico, he kissed me squarely on the lips and held be tightly and his arms are reported. Officer candidate school is late in the day as was acceptable. I overheard two large sergeants conversing animatedly about who among this miserable collection of pukes could possibly be chesty puller son. And I wondering if I had taken on more than I could handle. So they got a.
