Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number one 30 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good Evening Caesar. When he perceived that the seventh legion, which stood close by him was also hard pressed by the enemy, directed the tribunes of the soldiers to affect a junction of the legions gradually and make their charge upon the enemy with a double front which having been done since. They brought assistance to the one to the other nor feared lest their rear should be surrounded by the enemy. They began to stand their ground more boldly and to fight more courageously.

Speaker 1:          00:00:43       In the meantime, the soldiers of the two legions which had been in the rear of the army as a guard for the baggage train upon the battle being reported to them quick and their pace, and we're seen by the enemy on top of the hill and Titus having gained possession of the camp of the enemy and observed from higher ground what was going on in our camp, sent the 10th Legion as a relief to our men who when they had learned from the flight of the horses and the settlers in what position the affair was and in how great danger that camp and the Legion and the commander were involved, left undone, nothing to dispatch,

Speaker 2:          00:01:30       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:30       By their arrival. So great. A change of matters was made that our men, even those who had fallen down, exhausted with wounds, leaned on their shields and renewed the fight. Then the camp retainers though unarmed, seeing the enemy completely dismayed, attacked them, though they were armed. The horseman too, that they might buy their valor blocks the disgrace of their flight thrust themselves before the legionaries soldiers in all parts of the battle. But the enemy, even in the last hope of safety displayed such great courage that when the foremost most of them had fallen, the next stood upon those who were prostrate and fought from on top of their bodies when these were overthrown and their corpses heaped up together, those who survived cast their weapons against our men as from a mound and returned our dark wood, which had fallen short between our armies so that it ought not to be concluded that men have such great courage, had in judiciously dared to pass a very broad river, ascend very high banks and come to a very disadvantageous place since their greatness of spirit had rendered these actions easy, although in themselves very difficult.

Speaker 2:          00:03:15       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:03:19       so war is eternal and some things do not change. And in war we see the brutal examples of savagery and we also see the courage and sacrifice that's hard to find anywhere else. Like in that passage right there, unarmed men attacking the enemy and even the enemy showing courage, climbing on top of stacked bodies of their brethren to gain a little bit of high ground. Think about that. Gaining the high ground by climbing on the backs of your fallen comrades?

Speaker 1:          00:04:14       No, that is war and that account of war is from the book, the Gallic wars, which was written by Julius Caesar himself, although he refers to himself in the third person and that war lasted from around 58 BC, two 50 B c eight years of fighting between the Gauls who were a Celtic race of people in what is now France and Belgium, I guess you'd say Celtic and of course the Romans were known for their military strength and in the future, I'm sure we'll go a little bit deeper into some of Caesar's writing, but today we're going to look more at an overall assessment and instruction really about the Road Roman legions, which as I said, are known as an incredibly powerful military fighting force that conquered much of Europe and parts of Africa and the Middle East over time. And the writing that we're looking at today comes from a guy by the name of the giddiness.

Speaker 1:          00:05:42       Now his full name was poo bleus, Flavia's vagarious Renata's. But thankfully we can just refer to him as the Getty is not much is known about them. It's actually not even known. 100% if forgets. This was actually in the military, it, it seems as if he was, and even if he was, it's likely that he didn't have any great stature or rank inside the Roman military. But he did capture some incredibly important information and he called it the Apidra, more ray Miller terrorists, which translate, it's basically into the epitome of the art of war. Sometimes it's also called de re militaria, which means on matters of the military. And the book is estimated to have been written around four 30 a d so it's several hundred years after Caesar's rain. But this book that he wrote became a guide for warfare throughout the Middle Ages. And, and interestingly, this is even, it stayed even after we had gun powder and it was carried oftentimes by general officers and their staff throughout Europe. And there are even reports that George Washington carried an annotated copy with him, which as I dug into it may or may not be completely true, but at a minimum, at a minimum, he paraphrased Vegetti yeses book in his first address to Congress in 1790 when he said to be prepared for war

Speaker 1:          00:07:37       is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace. So brigetta has put this information together through at a minimum keen observation of how the Roman legions and the Roman military worked. And the book has stood the test of time. So I think we might as well see what we can get out of it. Yes sir. What do you think? Yes sir. [inaudible] check. It starts off strong. We'll say that starts off right here. Victory in war does not depend entirely upon numbers or mere courage. Only skill and discipline will insure it.

Speaker 2:          00:08:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:28       That's a common theme. We find that the Romans owed the conquest of the world to know other cause then their continual military training, exact observance of discipline in their camps and unmarried cultivation of other arts of war. Does this mean? I'm just gonna be talking about discipline for the next as long as I'm alive. Yes. It's entirely possible, isn't it? Yeah. It's interesting that he says it's, it's important than just mere more important than just mere courage. Courage is important, but there's something more important. Discipline. Yes. And skill and scale. Scale it where you liked that part. Yes. Okay. Romans. Okay. They thoroughly understood the importance of hardening them. So when he's talking about what the Romans do, talking about the Romans, that's the day they thoroughly understood the importance of hardening them by continual practice and of training them to every maneuver that might happen in the line and an action. Nor were they less strict in punishing idleness and Slough.

Speaker 1:          00:09:41       See, sometimes I stick up for like our generation or being modern saying like, no, you know, we're, we're kind of hardcore too. But then I read stuff like that and I kind of wonder, I kind of wonder, the courage of a soldier is heightened by his knowledge of his profession and he only wants an opportunity to execute what is, he is convinced he has been perfectly taught, so that makes sense. I did an interview a little while ago and as I'm, it hasn't come out yet, it was with NPR, NPR, national public radio, but he was asking me, he had heard me saying that an interview that like I wanted to go to war and he was kind of surprised about that. But that's exactly what this is talking about. You train and you're convinced that you've been taught well and then you want to go get after it. Especially when you're young, you, you have nothing to lose. Back to the book, a handful of men in nerd toward proceed to certain victory. While on the contrary, numerous armies of raw, an undisciplined troops are but multitudes of men dragged to the slaughter.

Speaker 1:          00:10:59       No big deal. Yeah. Multitudes of undisciplined men. You're just getting dragged to the slaughter. That's life. That's life. Oh, and here's another point for it is certain that the lesson man is acquainted with the sweets of life. The less reason he has to be afraid of death. Interesting. The young soldier therefore ought to have a lively I. Oh, this is he just talking about what, what the young recruits should be like, what kind of qualities they're supposed to have. The young soldier therefore ought to have a lively, I should carry his head, erect his chest and shoulders be broad, his shoulders muscular and brawny his fingers long. His Armstrong and his waist small. Going back to posture. Remember I brought that up with Jordan B. Peterson? Yes. He's got the in his book. Stand up straight with your shoulders back and I'm like, that's how you get indoctrinated in the military. That's been going on since the Roman times. There's something to it. I'm here to tell you, talking more about the recruits. He says they should be taught the use of their arms by constant and daily exercise. But this essential costume has long been abolished by the relaxation introduced by a long piece.

Speaker 1:          00:12:19       Can't accept that when things get easy. And you know, again, working with businesses all the time, it's, it's real easy when the times are good, like the economy's good right now. The economy's good, right? So people are just kind of making money and everything good. And then we'll train as hard. They don't prepare as much happens in everything. Yeah. Because we kind of subconscious will, it seems like you need any with sub constantly rely on that kind of push. Like the, you know, the stress will push you, you know, like if the economy is not good, it's like, oh, it kind of pushes you to like, oh we've got to, sure we don't work or whatever. And it kind of, okay. Do you, you know, some people, I think you actually do this, some people perform better under pressure. Yeah. The reason I say you because you'll, you'll have a video to make let's say, and if there is no deadline, let's just say there's no real, there's no real urgency.

Speaker 1:          00:13:11       Urgency. Like I'm not, I'm not, I'm not expecting to see that. But then sometimes there's a deadline like for a muster video. Yeah. And, and there comes the deadline and boom, there's the video midnight, one o'clock in the morning into my email. Yeah, you need that. You need that structure and discipline younger. It does help for sure. 100% yeah. Even even time stuff, like if you're like, hey, meet me at around seven. Well that's not correct. Yeah. Well it'll be more, it'll be around whatever time you might as well. I said show up when you want. I rolled the dice a little bit today cause I said 1230 ish. Did you notice that? Yes. To me when you put a number that I just assumed that's the norm. That's how. Yeah, that's probably good. Yeah, you're right. I think you're right. You're right. I think, yeah, you do.

Speaker 1:          00:14:00       You do pretty good with being on time for me actually. Yeah. Yeah. Well I'm gonna say your bat and I'm pretty good average. Yeah, sure. Did you see someone asked how they could get your job? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I told him to kill me and kill you. Yeah. There you go. I guess we know the price on your head. Someone else. Maybe they can be on time because really that's all it required. Press record beyond time ago. We'll money right now. He's talking a little bit about initial training. Going back to the book, the first thing the soldiers are to be taught in the military step, which can only be acquired by constant practice of marching quick and together, nor is anything of more consequence either on the march or in the line than they should keep their ranks with the greatest exactness for troops who march an irregular and disorderly manner are always in great danger of being defeated.

Speaker 1:          00:15:00       And I read that part so I could read this part. They should march with the common military step, 20 miles in five summer hours and with full step, which is quicker, 24 miles in the same number of hours. So these guys can march, you guys can march and we've talked a lot about foot patrols and in the, it's in the seal teams, there's something called a forced march, which is like you're on a road, there's no threat, you're just marching and you're trying to move from point a to point B. Don't do a lot of that in the seal teams. You don't even do that really much in the, well, I can't say that, but there's a difference. That's a forced march. We called it a forest road march and then there's patrolling where your tactical and you're scanning your field to fire. These guys are talking about a forest road march and you're just on the road. It's basically, or you're going as fast as you can, so you're just like maybe what, you don't have a ride if, I mean in your case, yeah, we'll never ride for whatever reason. Well, in the seal teams we usually had to ride.

Speaker 1:          00:16:00       Gotcha. Oh, here's a good one. Learn to swim. Every young soldier without exception should in the summer months be taught to swim for it is sometimes impossible to pass rivers on bridges, but the flying and pursuing army both are often obliged to swim over them. A sudden melting of snow or fall of rain often makes them overflow their banks and in such a situation, the danger is as great from ignorance in swimming as from the enemy. It's, I kind of take it for granted that people know how to swim, but it is not true. And when I figured that out when I went to Navy boot camp, because you'd think if you are joining the navy navy, you'd know how to swim. No, not true. Not True at all. People did not know a decent amount of people did not know how to swim. Yeah. I'm with you.

Speaker 1:          00:16:51       Student come from Cli where you know everyone knows how to swim. Even at two years old, you know, you know how to swim because you're on the island and it's all, but yeah, there's people, yeah, straight up. Some people haven't even seen the water, like the ocean or whatever. Well, there's definitely people that haven't seen the ocean. I mean, when I went to, when I went to seal training, there was guys that had never been to the ocean before. Yeah. They were from Iowa, you know? No, they're just salt. Why is the water tastes salty?

Speaker 1:          00:17:19       So yeah, parents teach your kids how to swim. They have those good programs now where they do the little floating program. So like even a little baby can float themselves and stuff. But you can look that up on youtube and learn how to teach your baby to swim and be careful. Effective. Yeah. It'd be throwing the, uh, what's that called? The safety. The safety tip. Yeah. That's, you got to, you know, when you're doing anything in the water, you gotta be careful. Really careful. Even when you're training in the, you gotta be really careful. One up one down is the rule. Like if one person is doing some trainings, someone's got to stand there and watch them, make sure that they're safe. But yeah, if you don't know how to swim, I learned how to swim

Speaker 2:          00:18:00       back to the book.

Speaker 1:          00:18:03       No state can either be happy or secure that is remiss and negligent in the discipline of its troops. Four is not profusion of riches or excess of luxury that can influence our enemies to court are or respect us.

Speaker 2:          00:18:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:24       This can only be affected by the terror of our arms. It is an observation of Cato that misconduct in the common affairs of life may be retrieved, but that it is quite otherwise in war where errors are fatal and without remedy and are followed by immediate punishment.

Speaker 2:          00:18:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:44       For the consequences of engaging in enemy without skiller courage is that part of the army is left on the field of battle and those who remain received such an impression from their defeat that they dare not afterwards look the enemy in the face. That's powerful stuff right there.

Speaker 2:          00:19:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:06       This can only be effected by the terror of our arms. That's underlying, there's a little underlying threats of violence and everything that, I shouldn't say everything, but dad, they're just, let me, let me, let me break down a little bit more cause I don't want to make a broad statement about the whole world, but when I was a young guy and it's the whole platoon, it was definitely underlying threats of violence. I mean even with a big smile on your face, even amongst total bros, like the, the, the thing that's underlying it was like, well, you know, yeah, if this escalates down, you know, we know how that could go. So yeah. Have the discipline train.

Speaker 2:          00:19:50       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:51       I don't know why I'm finding this book like almost comical in how on point it is with everything I think about, I kinda noticed that or yeah, I'm just, I mean the whole opening thing, the whole opening, the opening on slot of discipline, you know, I was straight up into it. So back to the book, too. Accustomed soldiers to carry burdens is also an essential part of discipline.

Speaker 2:          00:20:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:19       Recruits in particular should be obliged frequently to carry a weight of not less than 60 pounds exclusive of their arms and to march with it in the ranks. This is because on difficult expeditions, the often find themselves under the necessity of carrying their provisions as well as their arms, nor will they find this troublesome when a nerd to it by costume, which makes everything easy. Boom. There you go. Where the gear that you wear, the gear that you're gonna fight with, get used to it. These to, I used to, I

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       used to talk about this with like discipline equals freedom. The whole idea of it. I'd say if you have the discipline to wear your gear all the time, then you'll have freedom of movement when you need it. You know? I kind of felt like that was a stretch. Does that seem like a stretch? Well, no, not anymore. Not Anymore. This kind of back into the non stretch zone. Yeah. Yep. For sure. Because like, yeah, okay, so you have all your gear on, right? Jody Mitic was kind of talking about this I think when he was like, Oh man, you know, like it was just a pain in the ass to wear and all this stuff. That feeling, and that's a real feeling. What is it, man? This is a painted all this gear. This is digging into my, you know, I'm not used to it or kind of thing, but man, you get a guy who's really used to it, but that's not even a factor factor.

Speaker 3:          00:21:30       He's free and it doesn't take, there's two things that happens. Number one, you get used to it. Number two, you figure out your gear so that your gear works properly. Yes. So it's like, yeah, you can cause cause your gear when you first put it on, no matter, you could go to the best gear store in the world and you buy gear and it's not going to fit you quite right. You're gonna have to make little modifications. You'd have to adjust it. You have to put the weight somewhere else. Now in football you wouldn't always wear your gear and practice ride. Um, it was pretty designated, like depending on the day, you know, so you know, two days you have full gear, you know, two days you have just helmets and shoulder pads or whatever. But yeah, you were, you were when you were supposed to.

Speaker 3:          00:22:05       Some guys would like, maybe not where their mouthpiece or something like that, but it'd be rare I think in the NFL. Like they won't wear their iPads or their hip. Goodness. That's just cause it's a pain. I don't, I dunno, I can't really speak for that. I think I know the guys who run a lot and if you take out your thigh pads and you're like hip protectors and stuff, it helps you run for sure. But you run that risk and you should train with it. You should train with it. But here's the thing though, if if there's a rule, because some guys even in the game they just won't wear it. They just simply won't work. But you do run the risk of like if you get what's called a hip pointer, there's an injury called a hip pointer is basically your external obliques.

Speaker 3:          00:22:46       They kind of overlap your hipbone, right? And when a helmet or something hits that and crushes your excellent, our old bleak against your hipbones called the hip pointer and it's, it's a debilitating, painful injury that kind of where even in everyday life you were out of the game, out of the game. And I've had it before. So hip protectors will help against that. So you run that risk, you know? So it's up to you, man. I mean, I think in college, I know in high school it's like it's a rule you got to wear, but um, I think in the NFL you don't have to. That's good. I think the overall point is, and it sounds like the football was on board with it and train how you fight. Yeah. We are the gear train how you fight, but it's tough to though in, and this goes for any context situation even obviously, and really in the military, but it's a, it's almost like so obvious in the military that's a given where you can't train exactly how you fight, you know, so you can shoot each other. Yeah. And exactly right. Like I said, I used to tell guys that

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       I used to be like, hey, unfortunately I'd, you know, I'd be like, unfortunately, I can't put guys out here to actually kill you. You do the for for football. As it turns out, where you can't just have guys going in life as a week. Do you know somebody's hip pointers already be all day? Yeah. Actually you, so he goes on to talk about, it, talks about some slack here going back to the book, but negligence and off having by degrees introduced a total relaxation of discipline. The soldiers began to think their arm armor too heavy as they sold him, put it on. They first requested leave from the emperor to lay aside the curiosity and afterwards the helmet. In consequence of this, our troops and their engagement with the goths, we're often overwhelmed with their showers of arrows. So there you go and start taking that a little shortcut.

Speaker 1:          00:24:42       And I like how he says it's by degrees. Like no one just wakes up in the morning and says, I'm going to be weaker. Now they just, they just start to decay just a little bit. Take a little shortcut, you know, here's, here's a, here's a, here's a workout, a workout tip. Jockos workout tips. I'm serious. This is, this is like something that goes through my head when I'm doing some exercise. Let's say it's squat day and let's say it's, it's, I'm doing the 20 rep squats, which is just painful. Yes. And I have that thought in my head where sometimes, you know, I'll be like, oh man, you know what, just I'll just do 16 today. Cause you know, like, I mean I worked really hard yesterday and I'm kind of tying, you're still doing it and I'm still doing it. At least I did over there, no auto, you know, Blah Blah Blah Blah.

Speaker 1:          00:25:32       And when I hear myself saying that, I always think like that's the big, that's the first step down down the slippery slope. K and I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. Have you ever, have you ever skipped it? Come on, be real. Have you ever skipped it? Like you know what those doubts, not doubts, but those, those thoughts of, Hey, let me let me slack. Not skipping a workout. I mean, have you ever given you the only time? The only time where I've been like, you know what, I'm not finishing this workout is like I'll hurt something offer and this way and I've done it where I've done it, where I haven't done that. That's a lesson learned. Like I've been like, I remember one time I was squatting and I like felt a little, you know, you get a little twinge in your back.

Speaker 1:          00:26:12       I got one of those and then I kept going and then I was debilitated. I was like eight. I was like not good. But generally if, yeah, no, when I, cause it's this, that's why I'm saying this, like that little conversation right there is a good conversation to have with yourself because I think about, I think about that little, you just give that little bit of slack that time. Yeah. And it's not good. We know that. Just in my mind I'm thinking that leads to more slack right there. It does. That leads to a little bit more next time because next time you're to feel that way at

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       15 reps instead of 16 yeah. Because you've, even if it's subconsciously, you established a new little pres a precedent, which is kind of just the standard give a little bit. Yes, exactly. So it's like it's different if you're undefeated, right? If you're undefeated, you either undefeated or you not undefeated kind of thing. Once you're defeated, then you're kind of like, okay, you know, let it sneak in there. It's part of you now. I gotta say I'm defeated trade. I'd call my car. He ended the kind of at the end, you know, I live and do metcon and it's, you know, good. And I will also straight up, I'll be honest that it doesn't happen very often. I mean, I talk a lot of trash water, but it doesn't happen very often. But Oh yeah. There's times where we'll be like, ah, well that workout was pretty solid on me.

Speaker 3:          00:27:30       I'll do, I'll make deals. That makes me mad that, that, that makes me mad. And I, and I, I don't like that actually hanging with you made me get, gave me that mindset, which is a mindset I simply did not have go deaf Koran. No, but you know how you said it makes you mad. Like I never had that feeling. Never had the feeling like, oh, I'm making it. I just never thought of it that way ever. Like not even a little bit, didn't even consider thinking it that way. But now, yeah, when I feel it like, oh, maybe I'll do it tomorrow. I really don't feel I actually have that response where you kind of get mad at it, at yourself kind of thing. It's like you're split into two people. It is. It helps. It helps so much

Speaker 1:          00:28:12       check. All right. Let's see. Going back to the book, it was a constant custom among the old Romans to exercise both cavalry and infantry three times a month in by marches of a certain length, the foot. We're obliged to march completely armed the distance of 10 miles from the camp and return in the most exact order and with the military step, which they changed and quickened on some part of the march, they made these marches not in plain and even ground only, but both cavalry and infantry were ordered into difficult and uneven places and to ascend or descend mountains to prepare them for all kinds of accidents and familiarize them with the different maneuvers that various situations of a country may require. Guys put some miles on foot. Again, the reason that I wanted to mention that part is it's not just, it's not just about wearing the gear, it's drying to simulate as closely as you can to this situation that you're going to be in.

Speaker 1:          00:29:18       Same thing with anything. Same thing with sports. Same thing with business. When you're training, when you're training someone for business, put them in that situation that they as close as you can to what they're going to be in. Yeah. Here it continues to enumerate the different nations, so formidable of old, all which now are subject to the Romans would be. So he saying like we beat down so many people, we can't when I'm going to take the time to talk about them all. But the security established by long piece has altered their dispositions, drawn them off from military to civil pursuits and infused into them a love of idleness and ease.

Speaker 2:          00:30:01       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:30:01       Again, this guy's writing several hundred years after Caesar, so he's talking about the, you know, the, the, the slippery slope,

Speaker 2:          00:30:11       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:11       Hence a relaxation of military discipline. Insensibly ensued then a neglect of it and it's sunk at last into entire oblivion.

Speaker 1:          00:30:25       So he's watching the fall of the Roman Empire and where does it start? Lack of discipline. When the troops boom, I'm getting a kick out of this boat. The necessity therefore of discipline cannot be too often inculcated as well as the strict attention requisite in the choice and training of new levies. Don't, you can't ever let up the slack. You can't, can't ever say it's okay not to do that rep, uh, that that's in the book, he goes into a long sort of a long, long description of how they were organized like man by man, truth by troop. Uh, not going to go too deep into that, you know. Well one of the things he does mention in that section is as about how when they stopped doing a good job replacing the soldiers that were leaving, you know, you're, you're not keeping your, not keeping people coming in and not keeping them trained up and he, this is a good thing. I think this is good for any team situation. The expense of keeping up good or bad troops is the same.

Speaker 2:          00:31:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:41       But it depends wholly on you. So I think that's a good statement. No, you got, you got some good members on your team. You got some bad members on the team. It costs you the same to keep him. Yeah. You got to decide how you're going to, how are you going to manage that situation? Back to the book in former times, the discipline was so strict that the Tribune's or officers not only cause the troops under their command to be exercised daily in their presence, but we're themselves so perfect in their military exercise as to set them by example. Nothing does so much honor to the abilities or application of the Tribune as the appearance and discipline of the soldiers when they're apparel is neat and clean, their arms bright and in good order and when they perform their exercises and evolutions with dexterity, no big deal more. He's talking about just keeping the elements organized in a combat situation. Less the soldiers in the confusion of battle should be separated from their comrades. Every cohort had its shield painted in a manner peculiar to itself. The name of each soldier was also written on his shield together with the number of the cohort and century to which he belonged.

Speaker 1:          00:33:22       I liked that. I had a note in here about how we, we would name our vehicles so he'd know what vehicle to get into. You know, like the Harvey's piece would have names so you'd know which vehicle is yours? Well, the one called Zev, so they had all kinds of names for him. My first deployment to Iraq, my first deployment to Iraq, they were named after the movie. Oh, movie, right? Yeah. They were named after a movie. It's about bowling, but it's not the big Lebowski. Kingpin. He was a kingpin. That was the name. It was one of the Humvees was called big urn. Now What's interesting is the humvees originally were not named, they were numbered one, two, three, four, five, six and that seems like a pretty squared away. Like I joke would be good with that just to give him a number.

Speaker 1:          00:34:09       Here's a problem with it. When you're going on an operation, you'd go into a building to do uh, uh, a take down of a building. The vehicles move around, they get, they got to adjust. And when you come back out, they might not necessarily be an order numerically. So guys, but guys would go one, two, three, oh that's my vehicle. Gotcha. So they get in the wrong vehicle, which might not seem like a big deal. But then when you're trying to get a head count and someone is not the right vehicle and the vehicle commanders like I'm, I'm supposed to have eight guys and I only have seven. Now we're trying to sitting on the x trying to get a headcount. And that's problematic. But if you know what your name of your vehicle is, you confirm it and they're written on the side. Nice big letters looking for big urn.

Speaker 1:          00:34:47       You see it, you jump in. That make sense with the, with the numbers. Cause I think just by nature we assign numbers to things for all kinds of weird reasons. You know, like where if there's three things that are like if I see okay there's three bottles in a row mean you don't even have to know each other. And I say, Hey, grab the third bottle. It's kind of, there's a shirt, there's a kind of a ambiguous understanding. Okay. Then went the furthest one on the right. You know, it's like that. So the numbers can jam you. We numbered this podcast. Yeah. Cause it's like chronological. So, but interestingly they could've had just names. Yeah. In fact, maybe they should have, remember when the UFC, she used to be numbered.

Speaker 1:          00:35:25       They're numbered and then there's all know what it was. This is what I was thinking. They used to give them a number and then they would have like a crazy name. Yeah, yeah. The title. I'd like glory or whatever. And then they just started just calling them the names of the guys that were fighting. Yeah. Which makes sense once you have, that's kind of what I'm thinking right now. Like someone that's looking for a certain episode. Yeah. They, they would, they might not remember the number, but they remember the book or they remember the person. Yeah. That's kind of interesting. But we couldn't, but we do kind of do it like that kind of, but what is, is there value to having a number aside from keeping a count of how many episodes there are? Well I think, I think someone now can, if you know what one you're looking for and then you find it, then you can go and find it easy in your platform.

Speaker 1:          00:36:16       Yeah. But the easiest way if you want to know what, cause sometimes I don't remember what a particular, if you Google Jocko podcast and then whatever thing that you're looking for. Yeah. It'll take you to the youtube video. Right. It'll take you to the youtube video. Yeah. Cause the youtube videos that put the, somebody just told me on, on, somebody said, hey, you should review this book. Marise Stratacon strategic comms strategic on. Yeah. And I said, he said, you should really read this book and this guy has like been in the game for awhile. And I said, you should check out podcast. And I didn't run a one number was I googled Jocko strategic con and I found 57 boom. Done. So now, or you can say 57 C's to go back in there and look, right? Yeah. Check.

Speaker 2:          00:37:06       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:37:06       All right. Talking about drilling the troops back to the book, the younger soldiers and recruits went through their drills of every kind, every morning and afternoon, and the veterans and most expert regularly, once a day length of service or age alone will never form a military man for after serving many years. And undisciplined soldier is still a novice in his profession.

Speaker 1:          00:37:37       By practice only can be acquired agility of body and the skill requisite to engage an enemy with advantage, especially in a close fight. But the most essential point of all is to teach soldiers to keep their ranks and never abandon their colors. And the most difficult evolutions thus men thus trained are never at a loss amidst the greatest confusion of numbers. The recruits likewise, are to be exercised with wooden swords at the post to be taught to attack this imaginary antagonist on all sides and to aim at the side, feet or head, both with the point and edge of the sword. It sounds, I think some of those movies that came out because this isn't sound glorious to me, that maybe it doesn't to you, but to me that awesome. Mm. And then like movies like Braveheart where they're showing kind of the sword battles. Yeah. And how just psycho it was. I mean, that's a good reminder.

Speaker 2:          00:38:45       Yeah. Big Time.

Speaker 1:          00:38:51       Back to the book. In short, both legionaries and auxiliary troop should continually be drilled in cutting wood, carrying burdens, passing ditches, swimming in the sea or rivers, marching in the full step and even running with their arms and baggage. So in there, so that a nerd to labor in peace, they may find no difficulty in war.

Speaker 2:          00:39:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:13       For as the well trained soldiers eager for action. So does the untaught fear it in war? Discipline is superior to strength.

Speaker 2:          00:39:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:27       But if that discipline is neglected, there is no longer any difference between the soldier and the peasant. The old maxim is certain that the very essence of an art consists in constant practice.

Speaker 2:          00:39:45       Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:39:49       Discipline is superior to strength.

Speaker 1:          00:39:56       This is a solid book. The Art, the very essence of an art consists in constant practice, so whatever it is you want to be good at. Yeah, that's how you get good at it. Lafe and I just wrote another book. We've been writing a lot. I've been writing at a ton. Sure. And you can see the first draft was probably five times better than our first draft of our first book. And you know, we both have done a lot of writing in the military, you know, in college and all that. But your practice, you get better. Yeah. Jujitsu, guess what? You practice, you get better. Yes sir. He do pull ups. You're going to pull ups. Do pull ups.

Speaker 2:          00:40:42       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:40:44       here we go.

Speaker 2:          00:40:46       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:47       The last Simonian's made war. Their chief study.

Speaker 2:          00:40:52       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:53       They affirmed to be the first who reasoned on the events of battles and committed their observations. They're on to writing with such success as to reduce the military art before considered as totally dependent on courage or fortune to contain to certain rules and fixed principles. As a consequence, they established schools of tactics for the instruction of youth in all of the maneuvers of war.

Speaker 2:          00:41:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:21       How worthy of admiration are these people for particularly applying themselves to this study? Evan art without which no other art can exist. Boom. That's interesting. Hmm. It's interesting. Can you imagine it? Well for me, you know, actually I can't imagine when you're a kid you think like wars, just like Ah, just charge and then as soon as you get into the teams, sure. Like all there's maneuvers you can do. There's things you need to make happen. There's ways you can get advantage. It's not just what they call it, courage or fortunate. It's not just that at all. There's a whole lot of things involved. And it's also interesting that they were doing, they were doing studies and debriefs on the war, on the battles. Hmm. Cause it sounds like people weren't. And he says, hey look, they were the first two reasons on the events of battles and committed their observations they're on to writing with such as the sec success to figure out that there's a military art and how, you know, what, how fired up is it that

Speaker 1:          00:42:31       to study this art of war without, without which no other art can possibly exist too strong for you, I don't know for is too strong. I can see you. That's a bold statement for sure. It's a real bold statement. I don't think I've thought about it enough to offer any sort of an opinion on the deal, but hey man, I dig it. Kinda like Kinda like exercise in life or health in life. Yeah, that's true. But yeah, sure. Cool. You seem pretty fired up about it. You do. And this is where George Washington statement kind of paraphrased from back to the book. He therefore who desires piece should prepare for war. He who aspires to victory should spare no pains to form his soldiers and he who hopes for success should fight on principle, not chance.

Speaker 2:          00:43:31       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:43:31       no one dares to offend or insult a power of known superiority in action.

Speaker 1:          00:43:41       Do you get bummed out that you didn't learn this in third grade? Like this whole thing? Uh, yeah, yeah. Yes. Right. Including Jujitsu for sure. Yeah. Well, yeah, I feel like it. And you can, I learned this kind of from you in the beginning where you know how you have this kind of big picture kind of mindset, the long game. You're always like, you always correct me when I have this like short sighted. Yeah. That's what I wish I understood slash even. I don't know, off kids even capable really? Well, no, you're 100% right. And I've actually said this many times that kids have a hard time connecting what they're doing now with where it puts them in the future. Yeah. And I, I say kids and kids, I mean me, everyone, I mean I'm better now, but when you're, when you're a kid, like it made it and kids, some kids are different.

Speaker 1:          00:44:39       You know, like some of my, some of the kids that my kids hang around with, some of them are dialed where they've just got a vision. They know where they're going, they know where they're going to be an eight years, they know what they want to do. That's not a majority of the kids. Most kids are, you know, like, well, Hey, I can get this right now and that's cool. And they don't think about how it's gonna affect him when the future. And that's, that's, that's just really problematic. Not Understanding that long game is really problematic and I think we do a bad caught a bad job of teaching it as parents and as teachers and as a society. Yeah, yeah. Agree.

Speaker 3:          00:45:20       Well, I mean there's, cause you have, you don't, like JP says this and Lafe said this where they are like when I was a kid even you say you want it to be some sort of a commando, at least you had like an idea, you know, so there was at the very least somewhat in your mind it'd be like, hey for sure if I do this, that was, that was a savior. Yeah. So I think some families just through tradition and stuff like that, they'll have that structure like, hey, you're a, I don't know, you're a Johnson so you do this x, y, z. And it's just a matter of getting the kid to embrace that. Which is really kind of like, either they do or they know. Yeah. I mean I think if you're fair to your kids, because the law, I think a lot of times like we get caught up in like our own feelings, you know, in this thing like, well you know, I don't know, your kid's not listening to you or something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:46:09       You're like, oh my kid's not listening to me. You know, you get caught up in the feeling that emotions, yeah. You know, that we're rather than, hey, you know, that's, it is a problem that needs to be solved kind of thing. So I think that's the way you can alienate your kids real easy. And it's a common thing I think, where, you know, we'll alienator kids and then they won't embrace the, the, the pride and tradition of your family. Cause they're like alienated. You alienated him in one right now that sometimes you don't even know that you alien. You know how they're like, oh he's in a rebellious phase. You know, like sure there is such thing as a rebellious kind of phase because they know certain kids, they gather this or they gain the sense of like empowerment in certain ways, you know, so we want to test it out. They want to test the boundaries and all that. Unconsciously they know they've got to break away from their parents and they got to start practicing that. It seems, it seems natural, but if you have successfully alienated your kid when that rebellious phase comes, they're stepping right outside the game. They're starting their own thing. In fact, they'll give, they're going to have some resentment against dad. Who is this unfair tyrant who lame heaps of this stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:47:11       The kids never think their parents know anything. As a parent, I understand why I totally don't like, ah, I get it now. But that is funny. That really funny actually. I mean we just don't, it's not just parents like your teachers don't know anything. I'm not speaking for everybody, but like when I was a kid, my parents didn't know anything. Teachers didn't know anything. I knew everything. Dorks, budget, idiots. God, I'm stupid. So if you're listening to this and you're, you know, under the age of 40 you might want to listen to your, all right, that's good stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:47:47       He who desires piece should prepare for war. Remember that one back to the book in army to numerous. So now he's talking about the size of the army and the army to numerous is subject to many dangers in inconveniences. It's bulk makes it slow and unwieldy in its motions and it is obliged to march and columns of great length that is exposed to the risk of being continually harassment, assaulted by inconsiderable parties of the enemy. The encumbrance of the baggage is often an occasion of its being surprised and its passage throughout difficult places or over rivers. The difficulty providing forage for such numbers of horses than other beasts of burden is very great. Besides the scarcity of provisions, which is to be great, carefully guarded against in all expeditions soon ruined such large armies where the consumption is so great that not withstanding the greatest care and filling the magazines, they must begin to fail in a short time and sometimes they unavoidably will be distressed for want of water.

Speaker 1:          00:48:54       But if unfortunately this immense army should be defeated, the numbers last must necessarily be very great. And the remainder who saved themselves by flight too much dispirited to be brought to action again. And I read that whole thing so I could read this, which is saying, hey, like do you get too many people? I read that whole thing so I could read this. The ancients taught by experience, preferred discipline to numbers. Like we'd rather just have a small squared away group then a ton of guys. So where I see this with businesses, this is what businesses is. As businesses grow, it becomes harder for them to turn, right? It's harder for them to pivot. So you get big companies that when they were small, they were all agile and they were making things happen and they can change direction and then as they get bigger and bigger and bigger, they lose the ability to do that.

Speaker 1:          00:49:49       And so you've got to pay attention to that and what you have to do, there's a couple of solutions. It's like the solution is, yeah, you can stay small, but you don't want to spend it. Stay small as a business because you can't just like, you know, it's cool to stay small as an army, but there's only so much you can do with limited number of people. So what you have to do is you have to start to become more aware of what's going, what's going on, what's coming down the pipe in the future. Because it's gonna take longer for you to pivot this, this big monster you've got. So you've got to do it. You got to pay more attention. So when you grow in size, this is classic. When you grow in size a a business. If the leaders of the business continued to focus down and in to the company, they won't see what's coming over the horizon.

Speaker 1:          00:50:36       And that's when I get caught off guard and now they don't have time to pivot because there are a lot bigger. But they used to get away with it cause they were a little small company that could come into work on Monday and they could talk to everyone in one sitting and everyone gets on board and we move forward. You fast forward that and you go from 50 employees to 500 that are now, you know, spread out over a large geography. You can't make that quick move. And so what you have to do as a leader, as as you grow, you need to adjust your frame of vision from looking down inside your company to looking up and into the future. If you don't make that transition, you can't, you, you think you can turn things quickly, you can't. You can't. It's a big army and a big army has to be, it's hard to control a big army and it takes more lead time.

Speaker 1:          00:51:20       Yeah. And so that's the focus that you have to adjust to as you grow. You know? That's a good way up. So how do you do it then? Like you as the, well you, what you do is you have people underneath you if you're making widgets. And I was, when we started off, we had eight people and I was in a factory all day checking out your widgets and making sure that they were good to go. And I was testing them myself and I was making little adjustments. That's cool. That's fine. It works when we had eight people. But now when we get 40 people, I need to start going, okay, echo, can you, can you pay attention to the widgets in here? And then when I get to 300 people, I need to have four or five echoes that are down there that are watching this stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:51:57       So, so that's what you gotta do. You gotta adjust your field of vision. You've got to adjust. Your focus are all too. And what fools people, what fools people, what catches them off guard is that they think they can still pivot quickly because they were able to do it when they were smaller. When they had 30 or 40 people, they were able to pivot quickly. They've got 300 they can't do it and they get caught off guard here. Watch out for that. Kind of like a big cruise ship, right? Come talk to like a little speed bump. Of course like this. Of course those things take miles to turn miles. Those big oil tankers, they take miles to stop back to the book. The excellence of their discipline made their small army sufficient to encounter all their enemies with success. Now this is something else I see a lot in business world and this is very common, right?

Speaker 1:          00:52:43       You get the, you got the big, the big business, the big gorilla in the room or whatever and they can't pivot very quickly. Well then you get the smaller companies that are very agile and they start picking away at the big guy. That's what he's talking about right here. And like, just because you're small doesn't mean you can't, you can't take a shot at the title. You know, you could, you could move quickly. And if there's chaos going on, that's when you can adopt. Now are there advantages to being the big company with lots of money and lots of people and you're very stable? Oh yeah, absolutely. So, and are there advantages to being small? Yes, there are. The mistake that people on both sides make is they view themselves, they don't understand what their strengths and weaknesses are and they don't understand the strength and weaknesses of their opponents.

Speaker 1:          00:53:24       Right? Okay. So they say if there's someone that can move quicker than them, they all don't worry about them were bigger and more stable. All those people are maneuvering on you and they're sticking the needles in your feet and eventually those little needles get infected and there's a problem. Yeah. Got, you know, situation going on. So you have to constantly, as a leader, and again, this is why leadership is important. You have to, as a leader, need to assess what's the strength of that group, what's the weaknesses? What is, what are our strengths? Right. We keep hearing this again over and over again throughout all these ancient military leaders. Know Yourself, know your opponent, know your strengths, know your weaknesses. For sure people fail to do that. Problematic.

Speaker 2:          00:54:03       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:54:09       Here we go. Uh, famine makes greater havoc in an army than the enemy and is more terrible than the sword. You know, I, every time I, we've read that in the last couple books, people talking about how it's better to starve your enemy. It just makes me really, really thankful that there's abundant food in this country right now. It really does. I mean, I, I've never been starving. And can you imagine starving to death? It's gotta be absolutely heinous. Yeah. Worse than the sword. According to the Getty's and army drawn together from different parts sometimes is disposed to mutiny and the troops though not inclined to fight, pretend to be angry at not being led against the enemy such seditious dispositions. Prince Burley's principally showed themselves in those who have lived in their quarters and idleness and a feminist. See these men on a costume to the necessarily fatigue of the field are disgusted at its severity. Their ignorance of discipline makes them afraid of action and inspires them with insolence.

Speaker 1:          00:55:25       So you let your, it's one of those, it's one of those dichotomies. That's what it is. And if you let your people do whatever they want, they get soft and then they start to rebel. You want to talk about kids, you know, let your kids do whatever you want, whatever they want, and see how that works out for you. Lack of discipline of your kids. You're gonna end up with some rebellious kids. Yes. Now, am I saying that you need to beat them like a dog? I was into submission. No, I'm not saying that at all because then you don't what that dog is that dogs crazy. That dog will bite you at some point, right? Or somebody else or somebody else is problematic. So you have to find the balance between those two things.

Speaker 1:          00:56:06       He says there's, there's several remedies for this evil. Let them be constantly employed either in the field days or in the inspection of their arms. They should not be allowed to be absent on furlough. They should be frequently called by role and trained to be exact in observance of every signal. Let them be exercised in the use of the bow and throwing missile weapons and stones both with the hand and sling and there and with the wooden stored sword at the post. Let them be, let all this be continually repeated and let them be often kept under arms until they are tired. Let them be exercised in running and leaping to facilitate the passing of ditches. And if their quarters are near the sea or the river, let them all without exception be obliged in the summer to have the frequent practice of swimming. Let them be accustomed to march, March through thickets and closures and broken grounds to fell trees and to cut out timber to break ground and defend a post against their comrades who are an endeavor to dispossess them and in the encounter, each party should use their shields to dislodge and bear down there antagonists, all the different kinds of troops thus trained and exercised in their quarters.

Speaker 1:          00:57:22       We'll find themselves inspired with emulation for glory and eagerness for action when they come to take the field.

Speaker 1:          00:57:32       In short, a soldier who has proper confidence in his own skill and strength entertains, no thought of mutiny. That's awesome. Yeah. These guys were doing force on force training. He's saying, look, you're not going to use stores, but you're going to go against each other with your shields and fight for it. And, and this is, again, I've, I've answered that question a bunch of times where people, you know, how do you build morale and your team? It's like make them train hard, make them work hard. Now the real trick is to make them train hard, make them work hard. But at the same time, what you do is you give them ownership of that training. So they're running the training. Yeah. They come up with the ideas at you just respect the hardcore training that their debt they're doing and you do it with them. Yeah. You don't just inputs. It's different than just imposing on the team. Like we're going to do this hardcore training that will create a mutiny if you're not careful. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:58:27       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:58:28       Especially if you're not out there doing it with a more, if you don't explain why it's important. Yeah. I read this thing. This is to kind of add to that. Well, I think so anyway. They felt, was it, I forget what it was, but it said and allow for success. So like when you train, you know, you train our train hard, train hard, but allow for success for sure. Because if there's no success, it's like morale goes down after awhile and whatever. Yeah. Something like this for sure. You can't just, I just said can't beat that dog. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can't beat that dog.

Speaker 1:          00:58:59       It is much more to the credit of a general to form his troop to submission and obedience by habit and discipline than to be obliged to force them to their duty by the terror of punishment. So he's making the reason I pointed that out because it's making a clear, a clear delineation between discipline and punishment. Discipline, good punishment, bad. And he's saying those are two kind of opposite things. So I think that's very important. I think so too. And it's important to remember that you're treating your people good, you're taking care of them, that's what you're doing. And you don't necessarily take care of them by making their life soft. You take care of them by making their life disciplined and hard not to beat them down. There's a balance, but that's what you got to find. Yeah. Back to the book. It is essential to know the character of the enemy and of their principal officers, whether they be rash or cautious, enterprising or timid, whether they fight on principle or from chance. And whether the nations they have been engaged with were brave or cowardly. So again, know your enemy. You must by no means venture to lead and irresolute or different army to a general engagement for soldiers unused to fighting for a length of time must be considered in the same light as recruits. So He's saying if you've got people that haven't fought in a while and they're a little bit nervous, then you got to figure that they're just like recruits. You can't always trust them.

Speaker 1:          01:00:36       Then he talks about the general and says, if he finds himself in many respects superior to his adverts adversary, he must by no means differ bringing on the engagement. So if you're in a better spot than the enemy or you can take them go. But if he knows himself inferior, he must avoid general actions and endeavor to succeed by surprises and stratagems. This when skillfully managed by good generals have often given them victory over enemies, superior, both in numbers and strength. So this is common sense stuff. If you think the enemy is better than you, don't fight them head on. That's guerrilla warfare. If you think the enemy is bigger and stronger than you, you don't fight them head on.

Speaker 2:          01:01:15       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:01:18       All Arts and trades, whatever, are brought to perfection by continual practice. How much more should this maxim true in inconsiderable matters be observed in affairs of importance and how much superior to all others is the art of war by which our liberties are preserved, our dignities perpetuated and the provinces and the whole empire itself exists.

Speaker 2:          01:01:52       You don't really like that,

Speaker 1:          01:01:54       you're suspect, I think. Do you, do you like it enough for both? Okay. We'll take that. That's true though. Yeah. I actually, I can dig it. Yeah. I mean, let's face the facts here. If it wasn't for, if it wasn't for war, well then you'd just be enslaved by someone. I mean, I'd love for it to not be that, that for that to not be the

Speaker 3:          01:02:19       case, but if it wasn't for war, you would just be enslaved by people or someone else that was someone that believed in war would, you'd be the slave of them. Yeah. That's how it would work. Sorry, I'm sorry. That's, that's, that's the nature of the world. No, no, you're actually right. Yeah. Cause it's like, it's like the hope or wish that everyone was just perfect. Of course. That'd be great. Or actually in a way would it be great though? You know how like, sure, that'd be great. Everyone got along, everyone singing Kumbaya but isn't isn't like stress or imbalance or whatever. Isn't that the catalyst for any kind of progress of any kind? What do we do if everyone was just happy and it's just all good, satisfied, right? I don't know man. I think we'd be in the stone age. I just think it's bad.

Speaker 3:          01:03:04       Yeah, we probably would be. But guess what? If we're in the stone age and I see that you got a piece of whatever piece of meat or a rock that I want, guess what? I know best scene that you were talking to reality. So, but I mean I guess the question is not to go off on too much of a tangent, but the question is, would you want it to be all peaceful all the time with no progress? Would you want that good theoretical question? Kind of know, right? I mean, cause you're kind of thinking that you're going to think of, do you like doing graphic design on a computer, which wouldn't exist if it wasn't for war? Nope. Who would not say point taken. But even like even like competition. Right. You know, it's like, yeah, competition is good. Healthy competition is good. It's good for you.

Speaker 3:          01:03:48       It makes you be, it doesn't feel like that. Even when you're in the moment, it's like, let's say you're just dominating and whatever. I don't know, you play tennis, I don't know. And you're killing everyone. You're number one, you're breaking world records your money and then you kind of notice this new young, hungry guy coming in. He starts breaking your, some of your records, you're like, you don't like that you, that makes you kind of mad. You kind of wish that never happened in, but at the same time, that usually is a catalyst for you to start working harder. Sure. In preparing for that young, I'm all about it. Yeah. So, but you're going to cut and you like the, the head to head, you know, like you'd like that. Yeah. Like the competition. Yeah. You like directly though, you know, like when you say when I think anyway, it wasn't, when they say healthy competition is good, it's the result of healthy competition is good.

Speaker 3:          01:04:34       You get the best products right in the market or whatever and that's a result. That's why it's good. That's why it's kind of empirically good. Ultimately. I agree. Sure. It's not a perfect process. You know? And I know you're on the fence of, I know, but, but you, you like, like if I came up and you could tell I was feeling good, that would make you, that wouldn't make you nervous. You'd be happy. You'd be like, you like that head to head. It felt you were feeling good about what? Come on. Let's face it on the mat. Oh, on the mats of justice. If you come up to me and you're all excited or even give me the Echo Charles Kao. Okay. Cause I just played that through my mind. Yeah. When I see you like that, I'm like, oh yeah, it's even more on. And so I'll even put it more accurately, more extreme, more understandable as far as what I think you're like, so let's say we went enrolled in, I tapped you out all right.

Speaker 3:          01:05:25       For the first time. Sure you wouldn't like, you wouldn't like that specific thing, but when we roll again, that's when you'd be at your happiest right there. That's what I think. Like I think most of us, you, you want more of a challenge. Yeah, like all of that. It's really on now that moment to you is a very pleasurable moment is what it seems like. For some people, like from, I don't know. I would even argue for like a lot of people like that. I mean maybe that's a good example, maybe not, but that moment usually is a very stressful moment. Like, Dang, I know I got to deal with this now. You know, and sure it will result in the way better stuff for sure. But the moment is less embraced men on normal people people should pay attention to too is the thing that bothers people.

Speaker 3:          01:06:14       Again, topic we've talked about before. The thing that bothers people is the anticipation of the situation. But most people like you, you like we were talking about you making videos earlier when you know, like there's a muster common in your by like, oh, I got to do this video that I would imagine hangs over your head more than when you actually are all right, now you're doing the work and you're putting it together and it's getting dialed. Yes, true. That's how I feel about things. You know, I'll be like, there's something that I got to do and I'm like, oh, it's like, ah, you know what you do, you attack that thing. And now when you talked to me earlier about working out and like, Hey, do you ever just call it? What I will do, which is major weakness, is I'll, I'll like, I'll like, wait, I'll, I'll, I'll pace, I've, I've posted this on Twitter before.

Speaker 3:          01:07:01       Like, Yo, I hemmed and Hawed, I, I re I, you know, redid the weights, I vacuum whatever. I'm taking all kinds of reasons to not start procrastinating it. I'm going to do it, I'm gonna make myself do it. But I'm just, I'm just like being such a baby, but I do that 200% and I'm not talking hours, but it's there in 20 minutes, you know, 20 minutes of like, you don't want a better stretch out more. Yeah, yeah, exactly. That's weak. Weak. Do it. Just do it. That's the thing that you know what you don't want. That's one thing I'll tell you. Two Little Wah. This is a workout tip from Jocko Day. You Do, you put a stopwatch on stuff. Even when I'm doing something that's not really, even when I'm doing something that's not really focused on the time, I at least put a stopwatch on it so that I just gotta keep, you know, you just keep, it just keeps it on paceman cause otherwise that feeling that I just talked about, we'll, we'll start finding itself in between sets.

Speaker 3:          01:08:04       You know what makes it good? Yeah. It's weird thing. I'd mentioned this workout that I started a long time never really deviated, dealt with for it's, it has rest between sets as part of the workout. The time designated times. Designated time. Yeah. It was always, I don't think, man, I it, I cannot think of a time where it ever worked out where the time between the sets was just like ambiguous or something. It was always a specific time. So that little procrastination thing would creep up between exercises or, or before my first set, you know your warm up and the first sets of usually the heaviest for me too. So I'm like, all right, all right. And that'll happen. But you're right though, like if you watch on it, I have this one workout that I do where I do like it's Elsa's pull ups and then talk pull ups and then dead hang pull ups and then kipping pull ups and then Chin ups.

Speaker 3:          01:08:56       So it's like those five and you do as many as you can in each and then you, then I do something else in that I'd come back and do it again. I do like five rounds of that. So they're like burnout sets each one. Okay. And like the first time I did I was like, oh that was cool. And so when the first time I did it, you know, I was kind of um, let's just say motivated to do it. That was kind of fired up and this was years and years ago. And then the next time I did it, it took me a really long time and I realized because I just was taking a long time between sets, that's not the purpose of it. So now I always put a stopwatch on that thing. Yeah, keep, keep, keep the clock ticking and that's it.

Speaker 3:          01:09:35       And you feel it because you feel the clock ticking, you know, you're like, oh my God, I guess that that would apply to everything. Huh? Like you'd like, if you, and you know, that's why like when I write, I do a thousand words. You know, why? Cause it get thousand words done in an hour. Sometimes I'm always shooting to see if I can get it done in 50 minutes. Wait, wait. So you will, let's say when you write, you do, boom, you set the clock, your time, your watch. I don't set my watch. Yeah, it's, you know, eight 48. Okay. Nine 48 I'm going to be done. I'm gonna wrap this. I can, because that's even worse. You sit there and stare at a blank screen or you click on that little on that little internet browser thing at the bottom. Then there you go. You're going down that slippery slope. Don't do it. I'll do it. Check

Speaker 1:          01:10:27       talking about the general a little bit more. If therefore he finds his army composed of raw troops or if they have been long on, long been unaccustomed to fighting. He must carefully study the strength, the spirit, the manners of each particular legion and of each body of auxiliaries, cavalry and infantry. He must know if possible, this is good. He must know if possible, the name and capacity of every count, Tribune, sub alternate soldier. He must assume the most respectable of fordy and maintain it by severity. He must punish all military crimes with the greatest rigor of the laws. So there's a dichotomy there. He's saying you should know the name of every single person on your team. At the same time, if they get out of line, you maintain by severity.

Speaker 2:          01:11:19       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:11:22       For troops that have never been an action or have not for some time been used to such spectacles. Been used to such spectacles are greatly shocked at the site of the wounded and dying and the impressions of fear they receive, dispose them rather to fly than to fight. That's again to me is how to you train people and get them used to what they're going to be facing in the real world. Always keep that in mind as a leader, and I was about to say, almost keep, always keep that in mind as a trainer, but as a, as a leader, guess what you are. You're the trainer.

Speaker 2:          01:12:00       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:12:04       Having explained the less considerable branches of the art of war, the mill, the order of military affairs naturally leads us to the general engagement. So now he's up to this point. He's only been talking about how to get ready for war. This is a conjecture full of uncertainty and fatal to Kingdoms and nations for indecision. In the decision of a pitched battle consist the fullness of victory troops must never be engaged in a general action immediately after a long march when the men are fatigued and the horses tired, the strength required for action is spent in the toil of the march. What can a soldier do? Who charges when out of breath? Sure, everyone's going to hit me up. See, you need more rest.

Speaker 2:          01:12:52       Hmm hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:12:56       And he goes on to a little, a little get after it right here. The sentiments of the troops should be determined before battle. It is necessary to know the sediments of the soldiers on the day of the engagement. Their confidence or apprehensions are easily discovered by their looks, their words, their actions, and their motions. No great dependence is to be placed on the eagerness of young soldiers for action, for fighting. Has some thing agreeable in the idea to those who are strangers to it. So he's saying the young soldiers that hadn't been a war that are all fired up the fight, don't listen to him because there's some agreeable in the idea of fighting to people that haven't done it before. And then he says, on the other hand, it would be wrong to hazard into an engagement if the old experienced soldiers testify a discussion of a declination, a disinclination to fight. So if the, if the old guys are like, Hey, this boss not a good idea, pay attention. A general, however main courage and animate his troops by proper exhortations and harangues, especially if by his account of the approaching action, he can persuade them into the belief of an easy victory.

Speaker 2:          01:14:11       With this

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       view, he should lay before them the cowardice or unskilled fullness of their enemies and remind them of any former advantages they may have gained over them. He should employ every argument capable of exciting rage, hatred, and indignation against the adversaries in the minds of his soldiers. Now this is something I disagree with. I disagree with this idea. I disagree with the idea of telling the troops that it's going to be an easy victory of telling the troops that, hey, they're cowards. I don't agree with that. And because when you do that, there's a lot of things that can go bad. Uh, number one, when you go against the enemy and you face him and they start doing good against you because they're more skilled than you expected, that's a problem. Yeah, I can jam up your morale. All that can jam up your morale really bad.

Speaker 1:          01:15:04       So I don't recommend ever disrespecting the enemy. I recommend you give them a full, not to mention if hey, this can be an easy victory. What's your mindset going into it? I mean, first of all, you're not training hard for it. You think you're going to win and easy it's called. Yeah, don't do that. No, you, you, you respect the enemy. I think the point that he may have been trying to make is like don't be afraid of the enemy. I get that. Nothing to be afraid of, but respect him. Didn't Frederick the great say something like the last last time, like something about remind them of how lame they are or whatever. Um, he did say something like that and actually it just, the thing that he was saying, what was it that he said

Speaker 1:          01:15:51       he, he was saying no. What he was saying was only talk about the enemy with total score. That's what he was when we talk about the enemy with total score, and actually he was also saying like you shouldn't even hate the enemy but don't let anyone know that you don't hate her. Which was kind of interesting and he's saying the same thing like rage and hatred and indignation. That's how you want them to be thinking of the enemy. So they both agreed on that point, but I disagree on the point of tell the tell your men that this is going to be an easy fight because there's not going to be an easy fight. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:16:23       Back to the book. It is natural for men in general to be affected with some sensations of fear at the beginning of an engagement. But there are without a doubt, some of a more to Morris disposition who are disordered by the very sight of the enemy to diminish these apprehensions before you venture on action, draw up your army frequently in order of battle in some safe situation so that your men may be accustomed to the site and appearance of the enemy when opportunity offers, they should be sent to fall upon them and endeavored to put them to flight or kill some of their men.

Speaker 2:          01:17:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:17:02       Thus they will become acquaintanced with their customs arms and horses and the objects with which we once familiarized are no longer capable of inspiring us with terror. It's amazing how good you get at something like if you've seen it one time. Yeah. You know, and just, just think about any situation. Think if, if like if you scare someone, which I enjoy scaring people sir. But if you scare someone and then they come back in and you try and do the same thing, it's like they're not scared at all. It doesn't work. So, so that's what, that's how you want to prepare your people. You get them used to. Those seeing what they're going to see. Yeah. Good. Generals are acutely aware that victory depends much on the nature of the field of battle when you intend therefore to engage endeavor to draw the chief advantage from your situation. The highest ground is reckoned the best.

Speaker 2:          01:18:02       Always take the high ground

Speaker 1:          01:18:11       talking about reserves, the method of having bodies of reserves in the rear of the enemy army composed of choice, infantry and cavalry commanded by the supernumerary lieutenant generals counts and tribunes is very judicious and of great consequence toward the gaining of a battle. Some should be posted in the rear of the wings and some near the center to be ready to fly immediately to the assistance of any part of the line, which is hard pressed to prevent. It's being pierced to supply the vacancies made therein during the action and thereby to keep up the courage of their fellow soldiers and check the impetuosity of the enemy.

Speaker 2:          01:18:55       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:18:55       so always have reserves. Don't overextend yourself. The post of the commander in chief is generally on the right between the cavalry and the infantry. Fraught for from this place, he can best direct the motions of the whole army and move elements with the greatest of ease wherever he finds necessary. It is also the most convenient spot to give his orders to both horse and foot and animate them equally by his presence. So position yourself in a good spot.

Speaker 2:          01:19:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:19:34       And able general never loses a favorable opportunity of surprising the enemy either when tired on the march divided in the passage of a river, embarrassed in a morasses, struggling with the Dick clarities of mountains, wind dispersed over the country, they think themselves and security or are sleeping in their quarters. So just take advantage of your enemy whenever they let their guard down. In all these cases, the adversaries are surprised and destroyed before they time to put themselves on their guard. But if they are too cautious and you and give,

Speaker 2:          01:20:15       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:20:16       but if they are too cautious to give you an opportunity of surprising or ensnaring them, you are then obliged to engage openly and on equal terms. So whenever you get the chance, you, you sucker punch him. Right. You know, is that the, is that, am I encouraging you go out in soccer punch people know. But if you're going to fight, take advantage of the situation, you've already determined that the enemy that needs to be fought, you're going to do everything you can to,

Speaker 3:          01:20:49       but isn't that you've got going anything. I just started a rash of sucker punches. No, I feel like you misused the expression. That's what I think from cause sucker punch is more of a waging of war or a certain level of war. When someone, and you're saying these are already at war, they're already at war now it's like it's Kinda sucker punches the kind of, hey, we're just going to go invade this country. They have no idea that were, you know, they don't know kind of their citizens said something bad about our president or something like that. But if you guys are in war and they are sleeping or something like that, oh no man.

Speaker 1:          01:21:23       That's good. Okay. I agree. No, I actually agree with you very much. Very strongly. I think you're correct. Yeah. In fact, I don't think you should soccer punch anyone. Yes, I agree. You shouldn't soccer punch someone, but if you are at war with someone, yes, then you're trying to get them at their least prepared situation. Yes, I agree. Thousand percent all right. This is important. The flight of an enemy should not be prevented, but facilitated generals unskilled in war, think of victory, incomplete. Unless the enemy are so straightened in their ground or so entirely surrounded by numbers as to they have no possibility of escape. But in such situation where no hope remains, fear itself will arm an enemy and despair inspires courage as powerful as you think about that fear itself, alarm the enemy if you surround them completely. When men find themselves, oh sorry. When men find they must inevitably parish, they willingly resolve to die with their comrades and with their arms, their hands,

Speaker 1:          01:22:41       the maximum that a golden bridge should be made for a flying enemy has much been commended for when they have free room to escape. They think of nothing but how to save themselves by flights and the confusion that you might think that you might think by that statement. He say, hey leg, you build the Golden Bridge for them to get away. Yeah. You might think that that's sort of a a merciful to do, but check out this line and the confusion becoming general. Great numbers are cut to pieces. The pursuers can be in no danger when the vanquished have thrown away their arms for greater haste. So an area guys are dropping their swords, they see an escape, they dropped their swords and they run for it. But you got them, you're waiting there for him. In this case, the greater number of the flying enemy, the greater the slaughter.

Speaker 2:          01:23:30       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:23:31       Numbers are of no signification where troops once thrown into consternation are equally terrified at the site of the enemy as their weapons.

Speaker 2:          01:23:42       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:23:43       so that's good advice. And that's, this is something as well, you know, I, it's not the same thing, but man, when you, when you do, when you're dealing with another human being and let's say, let's say you and I are talking about something and I know I'm right and I know you're wrong, but you kind of planted yourself into it. You kind of painted yourself into a corner. Yeah. I'll give you a little out and give you a little while. You know, I don't want to like, I want to do that to you. I don't want to do that to be hard work with, no, let me give you a little out like oh yeah. It's probably the way it used to be, but you know what, hey, you know, it's a little subtle where you like, yeah, yeah. You know, definitely I've done it before I call.

Speaker 1:          01:24:21       That's cool. I'm glad it worked. You know, we think of this so it gives good a little out. That actually is very, very, um, it's not, it's a nice thing to do, but it feels very smart. Very smart. It's very smart to do you give people a little out. Yeah. I have to do that with, I have to do that with a, I have to, my kids, you know, I'm a little out cause they'll paint themselves in a corner because they're kids, you know? That's what they did. They just ask what they do. Yeah. Yeah. It's, uh, when you embarrass somebody, cause that's kind of embarrassing, especially when you get into some argument where it turns into me and so you kind of thing, then you realize you're wrong and you're like, Oh man, I have to basically wow. I, yeah, give them, let me give out. So we're kind of, we're both winters can be good cause my ego's not involved over here on this happy that we can get along and moving forward. Yeah. Good with it.

Speaker 1:          01:25:17       Back to the book in the first place, your men must not imagine that you retired to decline in action, but believe you retreat and artifice to draw the enemy in to a more advantageous position for you where you may more easily defeat them in case they follow you for troops, you perceive their general despairs of success are prone, prone to flight. So what that saying is, and I should have given this introduction before, is that if you feel like you have to retreat, you don't say, hey, we're, we're, we're getting crushed here and we're going to retreat. What we say is, hey, we're going to bait them, we're going to move back and we're going to draw that men. So the guys go, oh, okay, I get it. If you're just like, hey, we're getting our asses kicked and we need to get out of here, you're going to lose. Your people are going to run away. But if you're like, hey, we're doing this maneuver, we're going to fade back a little bit, we're going to set him up and he'll go, oh cool, I'm gonna get an opportunity for payback. So that's a good point. Very good point. It seems like their mindset would still be in the fight in that case. [inaudible] versus [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          01:26:22       Exactly. You keep them in the fight. It's exactly. Now, once people once it, once the enemy is fleeing and you chase them, you gotta be careful. Back to the book, a ration inconsiderate pursuit exposes an army to the greatest danger possible. That a falling into ambush and bushes and the hands of the troops, enemy troops ready for their reception, for as in the term temerity of an army is increased and their caution lessened by the pursuit of a flying enemy. This is most favorable opportunity for such snares. So when you get somebody running after you, that's when you can catch him. The greater the security, the greater the danger troops when unprepared at their meals, fatigued after march when their horses are feeding. And in short, when they believed themselves, most security, the most secure are generally most liable to a surprise. All risks of this sort are to be avoided carefully and all opportunities taken of distressing the enemy by such methods. So that mindset that people get, like you just said, when they're running away is one thing. But also when they think they just one, they get the mindset of like, oh, we don't need security anywhere anymore right now. We don't need it. We're good

Speaker 1:          01:27:50       there. That one little line,

Speaker 1:          01:27:53       the greater the security, the greater the danger that that line right there, it doesn't make any sense. The greater the security, the great danger. What he's saying is when the, the greater the security is the greater the danger of being susceptible to letting your guard down. Yeah. Like if it name MMA situation, they got the idea we talked about before, but yeah, you've got them days, days and they're like, well I'm going to go either to the finish all crazy, not like as cautious as maybe they should be. Kind of that situation for sure. He's talking about the greater of the security. So the better you feel, right does it, your said, I keep losing that line. The greater the security, the greater the danger that the security, the greater the danger. That's what it is. So when you're feeling secure, watch it. Watch yourself resources in case of defeat. If while one part of your army is victorious, the other should be defeated. You are by no means to despair. Since even in this extremity, the constancy and resolution of a general may recover a complete victory. So just cause you

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       take a little loss doesn't mean you're going to lose completely. Yet not withstanding an entire defeat, all possible remedies must be attempted. Since many generals have been fortunate enough to repair such a loss so you can always come back and army after a defeat has sometimes rallied, returned on the enemy, dispersed him by pursuing an order and destroyed him without difficulty. Nor can men be in a more dangerous situation. Then when in the midst of joy after victory, there exfiltration is suddenly converted into terror.

Speaker 1:          01:29:40       So same thing, you're joyous cause you one and all of a sudden you're the tables, turn whatever be the event. The remains of the army must be immediately assembled. Reanimated by suitable exhortations and furnished with fresh, fresh supplies of arms. That's what you do when you get a good victory. You're like, all right, reload. That's what we're doing right now. And in this last section of the book, he, he kind of just breaks down and sums up the rest of the book that we just read. Hmm. So these are all pretty familiar. Most of them, cause we, I covered most of them.

Speaker 2:          01:30:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:30:26       It is the nature of war, that what is beneficial to you is detrimental to the enemy and what is of service to him always hurts you.

Speaker 2:          01:30:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:30:36       That seems like common sense. Yes. The more troops, the more your troops had been accustomed to camp duties on frontier stations and the more carefully they have been disciplined, the less danger they will be exposed to in the field.

Speaker 2:          01:30:55       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:30:56       Train them hard. Men must be sufficiently tried before they are let against the enemy. Train them hard. It is much better to overcome the enemy by famine, surprise or terror. Then my general actions for in the latter instance, fortune has often a greater share than valor. I like the idea of overcoming the enemy just by terror. Just just, I wish there was like a, a full chapter about that. That's legit. Those designs are best, which the enemy are entirely ignorant of till the moment of execution. Opportunity in war is often more to be depended on than courage.

Speaker 2:          01:31:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:31:45       To departure to the botch the enemy soldiers and encouraged them when sincere in surrendering themselves is have a special service for an adversary is more hurt by desertion than my slaughter. So if you get the enemy to like come over to your side, that's even worse to the enemy then when you're just killing him because you think about when you're getting your friends killed, you have some kind of vengeance. Yeah, but if they just take your friends and then like all in the, in the back room, having them having a glass of wine with, you know, you're like, okay, I'm going. If that sounds better than the deal I got, it is better to have several bodies of reserves then to extend yourself too much to the front. There you go. A general is not easily overcome who can form a true judgment of his own and the enemy forces. We've been hearing that one since Sun Tzu art of war. Valor is superior to numbers.

Speaker 2:          01:32:45       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:32:45       The nature of ground is often have more consequences than courage. These guys talking about terrain, that's what he's talking about. So everyone that's in the military, listen to this right now. Terrain, terrain, terrain. Learn to read the terrain.

Speaker 2:          01:32:58       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:32:58       this is a good one. A few men are born brave. Many becomes. So through care and force of discipline, great dichotomy there. Care for your people and through force of discipline is what makes people brave.

Speaker 2:          01:33:15       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:33:19       In army is strengthened by labor and weakened by idleness. Don't sit around, don't sit around. Keep moving. Troops are not to be led to battle and less confident of success. Novelty and surprise. Throw an enemy into consternation, but common incidents have no effect. Learn new moves. That's some advice I need to take. I always do the same moves, not good. He who rashly pursues a flying enemy with troops in disorder seems inclined to resign that victory which he had before obtained. So if, if you go pursuing the enemy when your troops aren't organized, you're basically trying to give away your victory. Hmm. So be careful when you pursue an army on supplied with grain and other necessary provisions will be vanquished without striking a blow. I need to, when do you find, sorry, I looked around and looking for like a, like a Roman soldier and they find some letters and stuff. But these guys must have been hungry talking about all the talking about the hunger.

Speaker 2:          01:34:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:34:42       On finding the enemy has notice of your designs. You must immediately alter your plan of operations. Check, consult with many on proper measures to be taken, but communicate the plans you intend to put an execution too few and only those of the most assured fidelity or rather trust no one but yourself. Hmm. Interesting. Consult many people. Yeah. Get some feedback from everyone. Next punishment and fear thereof are necessary to keep soldiers in order in quarters, but in the field they are more influenced by hope and rewards.

Speaker 2:          01:35:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:35:27       Oh, dichotomy for you. Good officers never engage in general actions unless induced by opportunity or obliged by necessity.

Speaker 2:          01:35:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:35:39       To distress the enemy more by famine than the sword is the mark of consummate skill. And this is actually the last one here. Dispositions for action must be carefully concealed from the enemy, lest they should counteract them and defeat your plans by proper expedience.

Speaker 1:          01:36:01       So those, again, I didn't cover all the maximums and the reason I didn't is cause some of the maxims that he talks about are, are legitimately ancient war tactical warfare, but it's worth getting the books so you can read those and understand them. And he, he kinda ends this book with a little note to the emperor of Rome at the time. And this is how he wraps it up, how glorious it is. Therefore for Your Majesty, with all these qualifications to unite the science of war and the art of conquest and to convince the world that by your conduct and courage you are equally capable of performing the duties of the soldier.

Speaker 2:          01:36:44       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:36:45       And the general.

Speaker 2:          01:36:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:36:49       I think that's actually a cool statement to end on capable of we performing the duties of the soldier and the general. So he wraps up the book with that last dichotomy and I think that's one of the, really one of the most important qualities for a leader to have. And one of the most important qualities to be able to balance. And that is to be able to maintain and lead from the highest position. And at the same time, never forget where you came from, right? You've heard that expression. You don't forget where you came from. That's what he's talking about. And I think for every leader, what that means is recognize that you still have more to learn that,

Speaker 2:          01:37:40       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:37:41       you can still grow, you can still try and get better. And obviously that's what we're doing here is trying to learn and trying to keep learning. Sure. He, and I think that wraps this up and obviously we make this podcast so that we can learn and other people can learn if they want to join in. If you learn anything and you want to, you don't give this podcast some support. There's a great ways to do it. And the goal when you support the podcast is that you also support yourself. That's, that's, that's the goal. Mutually supporting situation is what we're going for. So first off, we got our company up in Maine, up in New England origin USA in Farmington, Maine. A hundred percent American made products products.

Speaker 2:          01:38:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:38:40       It's a Jujitsu company, first and foremost, right? That's the foundation. These yes, and rash guards. Interestingly, gies one of the hardest things in the world to make from scratch,

Speaker 1:          01:38:53       and we make them here in America for sure. A lot of people think they're the best. That's actually what I think. Yeah. Well, so it depends on what you mean by the best. So if you think that the ones that fit the most appropriately for Jujitsu [inaudible], then yeah, then they're going to use your g, two g for Jujitsu. Then another basket of the best concur if you want. Various different weaves, various different options that happened to me, made it in America, and various perfect blends for washing, drying antimicrobials, stuff, you know, and yeah, they're the best. Yeah. When you see, what do you remember the first time you saw dragon? We've like with your own eyes. Yes. Were you impressed?

Speaker 1:          01:39:45       I was like, it's legitimately, it's, it's legitimately impressive. I actually, this is one of the dumbest things I've ever thought of in my life. All right. Lay It on me. When I first saw dragon, we've, I thought to myself, it would be cool to get a legit, cause you know, sometimes I got to wear a suit because I'm going to work with a company or something. I thought to myself, it would be cool to get a legitimate suit made out of this dragon dragon we've seen. Yeah. It took me about 20 minutes before I realized I was an idiot. But it's that cool looking. Yeah. Yeah. And it's that practical. That's the thing. Yeah. So anyways, you can get geese, rash guards, origin main.com. What else joggers show? Well, okay, so you wanted the sh the suit. Sorry Brad, you said it. So you know, let's say, let's talk about it at least a little bit. You said the soup soup dude, and you know, okay. You know, hey, give me dragging. We've suit. But they had, I've talked about this before where my favorite shorts are dragging. We've short, they were, they don't make them. Sorry. Not yet. Well,

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       so I was talking to Pete about, I don't know about them and I was like, hey, you know, like you should make the jegging waist and I forget why, but you know, not, not now there's other shorts which are actually could prove more dope check. You see the Buffy, like you saw the buttons, right? Like for the shorts are these by that, by their dope. Anyway, so yeah, there's some joggers, some, you know, some shirts and whatnot, some regular apparel or athletic wear. But I'm super comfortable. I'll tell you that as the, the self slash whatever proclaimed Kunstler of comfort I can say is the most comfortable stuff you're ever going to put on. If you find anything more comfortable, let me know. We'll see. Compare apples to apples, but yeah, some, uh, some good stuff there. Also some supplements.

Speaker 1:          01:41:41       Mm. And you know, speaking of this, uh, so you know, you know who doctor Rhonda Patrick says yes. She'd been on Joe Rogan a couple of times. Yeah. Probably even more than that. Anyways, she just tweeted out this thing talking about curcumin and, well, what is it like, no kidding. Double and triple whatever. Sure. Tests, Ucla. Um, curcumin is awesome for you and, but do you remember like what this is? This is the thing, it blew off. The article actually blew off, wouldn't you? Like it was like Yacker Q and keeps down inflammation. That was no big deal. But actually that's a huge deal. That's one of the reasons clients enjoy warfare. But then they did like a test and it improved memory and like cognitive reaction, 28% this is in a lab. And so, and then they referred to people in India that people in India who have a high level of curcumin in their diets. That's why Indian food, it looks yellow is because of that. There's one not just like direct, but they're saying that's really a interesting fact. Right? So anyways, that's in there. It's in joint warfare. It's enjoy more than just joint the Super Krill,

Speaker 3:          01:43:04       which is Krill oil. As we all know by now, Krill oil is pretty much the best source of Omega three better than fish oil. Yes. And we all know fish oil's good. Krill oils, even better. Super Krill oil even better than regular criminal. What the big difference between Super Krill oil and Krill oil? I do. Yeah, it's super. No, but there's been some actual technical beneficial super stuff and it's like Zen. It's something, but it's an [inaudible] not a no. It's like Xanthan [inaudible] or something. Sorry I'm saying it wrong, but it's an antioxidant, which is a big deal. You know what? Rust, rust, rust, oxidation. Yes. All that is oxidation of metal. So when you cause some I didn't, well I knew for a long time, but before I knew it, this is what it is. You know? Well, how my brain was as far as antioxidants go, my mom's like, hey, antioxidants.

Speaker 3:          01:43:57       I'm like, wait, oxidants, oxygen, oxygen, oxygen. Oxygen is good. We're like, why is it anti oxygen kind of thing. It's like, no, it's not anti oxidant. Oxidant meaning it fights oxidation, which is rust of your body. So your body technically is kind of rusting. You know? Antioxidants keeps it from rusting. So now that you, when you hear a loyal on your ears, you hear antioxidants, that's what you're hearing. It's going to keep your body from rusting straight up. So krill oil, Omega Three's better uptake than fish oil. Um, and we need to make many things. Just know that you need them in this case for your joints. In other cases, for your eyeballs, your brain, your Oregon's, all this stuff. But know that, just know that it has many uses plus antioxidants, boom, supercrew. That's what makes it super. Then joint warfare, as we mentioned. Yes, that's for your joints.

Speaker 3:          01:44:50       Curcumin, not just curcumin. Glucosomine can drain. These are things, man, I'm telling you. If you have bad joints, boom, joint work. Get some discipline too. But yeah, by the way. And so now what we have, as it turns out, according to Doctor Rhonda, Patrick, as you said, we have so that triple stack to each other. Yeah. So joint warfare, Krill oil is the joints, but joint warfare also has cognitive enhancements, which as does the discipline, the discipline is like a, what'd you call it? A powder drink. That's what it is, right? Yeah. That's, I mean, you mix it up. You put a little on your water bottle and then it gives you a little bit. Yup. It gives you that mental edge, uh, advantage. Uh, Dave Burke sent me a text, he said, quote, best quote from the last podcast. Dave Berg. Cause like a crackhead or something like that.

Speaker 3:          01:45:47       Sorry Dave. No offense. Yeah, I know. You're just like the discipline. Yeah. Hey Man. Did you see someone posted a picture of like a guy with like cocaine powder all over his face? Yeah, the Dave Chappelle situation. It's a good marks on that discipline. Cool. Well, so mark, okay, so that's a little bit of a shifting gears scenario in regards to supplements. Milk. Okay. I'm gonna say the word protein. I said this before. I'll say it again cause it, to me it's appropriate. I'm going to say the word protein powder, but I'm not going to say, hey, mo is a protein bar. I'm not going to say that it's not, it's not appropriate because it's different. This is how it's different. It's milk.

Speaker 3:          01:46:31       I just had a guy hit me up. He said, I don't drink protein powders, but it sounds like this is just dessert. Yeah. And I hate to say it, it's kind of true kind of things like that too. But dessert kind of has this like kind of guilty kind of feel to it. This is guilt free dessert. Here's what I did though. I was pushing, now I know and I was going to kind of let you know, but I was like, hey, you know it just let me just have it be funny for me. So I'm thinking literally thinking of mark while I'm shopping. So when I shot, I don't know how much you shop, but I go in next question and my go tos, right to get red leaf lettuce, eat a lot of red leaf lettuce for whatever and they get milk. But this time I'm thinking of the milk.

Speaker 3:          01:47:21       I don't know why. It was just in my head. I wasn't going to go drink some milk at that time. It was just my head for whatever and my eyes shifted to chocolate milk. So I'm like, Hey, what if I mix the chocolate milk with the milk? I know, right? It might be too much do it. No, I didn't do it. You don't need to. Then again, why would I knock it before I try it? Because what if I discover something? See what I'm saying? I didn't do it yet. I'll report back button on the less it is like a desert, but it's one of those beneficial desserts like not like dark chocolate like you know, considered dark chocolate. Right. I mean it's a certain percentage rate or something where it's like good for you. Yeah, got drink and that was kind of like that.

Speaker 3:          01:48:02       It's like a big milkshake but an egg in there you really want to get, we'll, we'll have some milk for sure. At the immersion camp, which is by the way, August 26 that's the one it is. Last year we didn't have more milk wasn't even invented yet. Yeah. It was like straight up. Didn't exist. Didn't exist. It was like then all of a sudden you cracked an atom open and they had to add milk to the periodic table. That just happened last year. I had to drink. I do drink chocolate milk because they had it at the camp. Oh, right, right. You have to deal like the old school cafeteria chocolate milk. Just, just, it's just not, it's just horrible. You don't like it. I mean, I think I'm addicted to the experience because that's what would it had east not good. It's not good. So yeah, immersion camp, August 26 in September 2nd that's the last day about this two sessions in there.

Speaker 3:          01:48:52       I would say, uh, you know, I can't speak for anyone else. I would say, yeah, go to booth because that's good. But you know, go to one but a two, whatever. For those that are wondering, and this isn't confirmed yet, but we pretty pretty much had the talk Pete, me and, and be little and the conversation is looking like one morning tea afternoon, Nogi evening, whichever choice. Yeah. That's like a dream, isn't it? I think so too. And I don't have any complaints from the last one. Literally I have no complaints. But I do remember thinking if there was some Nogi mixed in here, this would really, this would make me kind of not really want to leave you ever. Yeah. Yeah. This is worth pointing out. This is the kind of thing that I, you, you ever think about like people that are OCD? Yes.

Speaker 3:          01:49:52       I think about that all the time. Right? Obsessively compulsively. So sometimes I have a little bit of that, but one of them is, is like I want things to be squared away. Right. And so when I was going to the camp, I was kind of like, how has this whole laundry thing going to work? Like what's going to happen? This was before. Yeah. Well the thing is just to let everyone know, if you come to camp, they, they do laundry, there's like a laundry service. It pick it up, they pick it up and they wash all your clothes and then they bring back in all your clothes nice and clean. And that's a huge, so you think you could basically get away with two D's? Two Keith? Yeah. Well maybe three. I, yeah, I would say, wait, I only had two, probably three days. I didn't bring any geese.

Speaker 3:          01:50:34       I got origin, I'll bring it to and bottling them to get there. Yeah. Yeah. I'm saying to rotate them through properly, but they're pretty fast on its turnaround anyway. So that's the deal. But the end, but that's a, that's a, that's kind of a big deal. The logistics, cause there's a difference between, hey, there's the laundry service, um, walk across camp to the laundry mat and go handle your business. Well, and actually the campus at a different same lake, echo lake, but it's a different lake. But, and I don't know what the exact laundry service. I think it's gonna be the same exact thing though, because the service didn't come from Cam. I somebody that does laundry for geese makes it, there should be people in the world that just geeky laundry. Keala yeah, they come and grab it though. They knock on the door. Like room service. Yeah. Really? It's a huge deal. I think it's very convenient. Great. Nice. But yeah, emerging camp, August 23rd, August 26 through September 2nd two sessions. I'm gonna be there. Jocko is going to be there. Rolling. Rolling to fulfill your curiosity of how it is to roll with you.

Speaker 3:          01:51:35       Um, I'm not going to say it'll be a good time rolling with jock. I'm not going to say that like my down my, yeah, you might get let down as far as pleasurable experiences go. Might let you that mind to bs. Everyone thinks all he's gotta be stolen. Believable? No, it's to come. Not that good at Jujitsu. Yeah. I wasn't really thinking that. I was thinking more. Um Oh yeah, that'll be fun and pleasurable. Meanwhile it'll be like, like 90% painful and then like 5% embarrassing and you know, and various other negative emotions. But yeah, he can, you know, whatever. If you wonder about that kind of stuff. I Dunno, maybe you don't, but yeah, that's in origin also. We have a store, actually Jocko has a store and it's called Jocko store. Who made that name up? I did keeping it simple. Anyway, this is where you can get the rash guards that we make get after it.

Speaker 3:          01:52:30       He'll trooper rash guards where your kid rash guards too by the way, if we're youth or your kids getting into Jujitsu, boom and for surfing and for whatever, running, cycling, all that stuff. Um, and uh, what other rash guards are there at five? I was going to make it make sense to yeah. I stand by it. Get some rash guard. That's what I'm going to make stand by to get. So check I was going to make a good rash guard but then I thought, hey, what's the message of good isn't it isn't standing by to get some too close to get after it? No. Okay. Because Stan but now you stand by to get something is when you're standing by to get some getting after it is when you're actually getting after it. So when you're standing by where you're getting after is two different things.

Speaker 3:          01:53:13       Completely back to the good rash card is important I think as far as the layers go. Okay, good. Is like when something quote unquote bad happens, there's always something good to come from it. So what you sit to direct quote, so you can't make him put on a rash guard that's based on something bad happening as far as losing goes or something like that, right? No. Okay. I guess you could technically, if it looked dope, I dunno. Jury's still out. Anyway, back to the tee shirt. There's some corns on there, right? I just put that diff core on the tee shirt def. Yeah. Good idea. I think you're, you're right about the, a lot hats on there as well. Two kinds of hats as a, right. Actually three technically three types of headgear, trucker hats, flex fit hats, beanies. Just in time for summer. It's actually been, he's been out for awhile and things was go give yourself too much credit.

Speaker 3:          01:54:09       But speaking of summer and winter hoodies, you'd get hoodies on there too. Legit hoodies, non Hawaiian hoodies. You know you're going to make, you're going to make a Hawaiian hoodie apparently. Yeah. I think technically there's no such thing as a plain Hoodie, but I will have a lighter weight Hoodie for when you go to Hawaii and it turns nighttime and the wind, the breeze kind of blows and you're like, Dang, I wish I had my long sleeve shirt on. You know, and it'll look kind of don't. That's what I think. That's my whole approach in my opinion. It's a women's stuff on there too. Um, you know, for the lady troopers, some tank tops and v neck type t shirts made specifically for the ladies. Solid discipline equals freedom go down. Also other ways to support. Another way to support subscribe to the podcast. If you haven't already on iTunes and stitcher and Google play or wherever you listen to podcasts, whatever platform you choose to use.

Speaker 3:          01:55:06       Also Youtube. Yeah, you should subscribe to Youtube. The reason is so you can see echoes legit videos. For instance, you just rereleased one thank God. Yes, echo had made a video for warpath and he put Christmas, which we all love, which it was during Christmas time. And the thing is, the video is so graphically intense and I, I could tell and you had actually told me that it took days, days to put together three worth of yeah. Film. And so when you showed it to me, I was super pumped and then I heard the music that was super unpolished. Yeah, it was on pumps and anyways, he's redone the warpath video now as good music behind it. Not Christmas music. We'll just say revised, revised.

Speaker 3:          01:56:07       Did you pull off the old one broke down. I left it man. That's for us. You know folks who like Christmas, all of the Grinch over here. I know. But yeah, it's good. Youtube yet. Subscribe to the Youtube and leave a review on the, on the iTunes thing. If you're in the mood. That's my opinion. There you go. Good way to support to also if you are looking to improve and increase your supply of fitness gear. I just got a few things from my, my bicep brats. You don't, when you kinda choose to embark on a different type of fitness, I dunno, you stick with the same thing. I get it. No, but getting different things. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You get fired up. But anyway, no, I don't want to go into that, but I got some new stuff anyway. Where you get it is in my opinion, could on it.

Speaker 3:          01:56:53       So on at Dotcom. Slash. Chocolate you can get some good stuff on there including, but not limited to kettlebells. Maces and we get battle ropes. I just read some really good stuff about battle ropes. I've done them, but not with any kind of regularity. Yeah, yeah. Like I want to, I want to do a battle rope program. Hmm. Yeah, man. I hope I don't go in too much, but it's like, you know, like if you're trying, it's like for metcons and you can dump your full body, boom, boom, boom. Yeah. It's like it burns a lot of calories. Get to in a muscular muscular conditioning and stuff like that, but really good. I was like, after you read it, it's like you want to do battle ropes from that one inquiry. Anyway, go ahead on it. Dotcom. Slash Jocko. I got the mace from Jocko today as fired up.

Speaker 3:          01:57:39       Heavier than your saw. Yeah. So and I knew it was going to be happy. That's the thing like I know because that's only a 20 pounder and lucky if you're one of those things. I think you know when we talk about kettlebells and people will say like what size kettle bell do you start off with? It's hard to narrow that down. That thing is heavy. There's not too many people that are just getting all over that 20 pounds. This is like too heavy. I've never done a workup before. By the way, this is too heavy for me to do like a workout. I'm like, even even like it's so, it looks like a big, what do you call it? Not a bowling pin, but you know the juggling pins, you know like the people in the jail. So it looks like that, but it weighs 20 pounds.

Speaker 3:          01:58:18       It feels like it weighs like 50 pounds. Literally feels like that because it's all big anyway, but I'm going to, I'm going to work it in and I'm going to report back and I feel that suit. I'm going to be a lot stronger than you son like it. That's good. Speaking of that, if maybe you're thinking, oh, instead of working out I'm going to take a break. You can get the psychological warfare album that has tracks, it's on iTunes, Google play MP3. Whenever you get mp3s. Just a little bit of guidance on how to overcome situations where maybe you're not going to get after it and you know you should. Yeah. So there you go. Working on psychological warfare two at this time, so that'll be coming in the future. All your excuses are lies going to be the title, psychological word for it to all your excuses are lies.

Speaker 3:          01:59:08       Yeah. See that kind of came well that's good. I like how you do that. I'd call it like a spot, like a spot. Like if I'm going to go psychological spot. Yeah. That's what it is. Cause all of that though because not everyone thinks of, when you say spot you're thinking of 1994 weight lifting bodybuilding. Sure. Oh No, power lifting. Yeah, I guess you can't really spot on a, on a power clean like Olympic lifting. Nonetheless, it is a spot nonetheless regards to what an analogy you want to use. I think the band, the spot is the best because you don't need a spot necessarily. Most of them, you don't need it most the time. Cool. But if you've got a spotter there and you need the spot, boom, there it is and he's in a spot you and he's going to bring you through.

Speaker 3:          01:59:48       You're not going to let the barberry you understand. Fair enough. Also, Jocko has some tea. It's called Jocko white tea. Interestingly enough, uh, dry tea, which is tea bags and in it can, which I've been popping every day. By the way, I'm not going to say it's an anti nausea medication. I'm not going to say that. But as it turns out, it's kind of an antinausea medication. Super refreshing because I can't, by the way, it's also anti weakness because once you drink Jocko white tea, you can deadlift 8,000 pallets automatically. Hey, it's available in Canada too on Amazon in Canada. That's new. So checkout Canadian folks up there, hanging out with Jody Mitic somewhere. Sure.

Speaker 3:          02:00:35       Then you can get it there too. Also got some books where the warrior kid and Mark's mission, those are for children. But I think everyone that reads him get something out of him. He's so check them out there. Might like them. That video you did with Brian Rose, right? The lending area one. Um, some of my brothers watching the video, I don't know why he's all like surprise, like he's impressed. Okay, I get it. But like he's all surprised, impressed, you know the difference. Right. So he's watching the video, the, you know, how you basically the part where you were explaining where the work here, part two marks mission, where are you like okay, this psychological bully, you know, did this thing and no mark wants to fight. I mean you can fight now, no Jujitsu. So he kind of wants to fight him. So uncle Jake psych, you know, comes in and he's all, hey cool, you can fight them.

Speaker 3:          02:01:26       So I was like, Oh Jake, you know, getting nuts, whatever. Okay, you can find them. But first you got to do recon or Intel right until gathering or whatever, see what up. And so he does and he finds out all this stuff you and through like finding the stuff or whatever, he gains like a little bit understanding or whatever and so instead of fighting them, maybe you should help them kind of thing. So it's like this little curve ball. It's like, man, it's like kind of taking the high ground when you don't expect you to just kind of liked that he liked down. He's all impressed. Impressed with it. Not Bad on, let them read that thing, still reading it until my girl little girl. That's Jack's kind of the ethos, right? The way that where he kid eat those, you just read it. You just keep reading when you're done reading it, you read it again.

Speaker 3:          02:02:05       Start all over. Yeah. Yeah. She likes it. She liked the paper, Mashiach pumpkin situation. She really liked. That part was actually pretty fun. It was good and all are shining through. Oh yeah. Big Tech. Also the field manual, discipline equals freedom field manual. Best Book ever written. Best Book. Physically look at my opinion. Black on black. But do you think of that front cover for a photograph? You like that? Yeah. It's very iconic photograph. Yeah, that's a good, that's a, it's like what do you call like a manual for if you make it a manual for life in general, I think you'd be on the good path right there.

Speaker 1:          02:02:46       I agree. I agree. If you need a manual for some leadership, you got extreme ownership. That's the book that I wrote with my brother Leif Babin and it's about combat leadership and how you can apply the lessons that we learned on the battlefield to everything you do in your business and in your life and your relationships with people and also coming pretty soon. What actually is the follow on to that book that are also wrote with leaf, the dichotomy of leadership. It is, you know, you, you've heard us talk about dichotomy all the time. It's actually the last chapter of extreme ownership and this is the trickiest thing about leadership is trying to balance this dichotomy so we talk about it and do a deep dive and get granular on how to balance that economy of leadership. In that book, which is titled The dichotomy of Leadership.

Speaker 1:          02:03:42       You can preorder it right now. It comes out September 25th if you don't want to get a copy when it comes out, then don't order it now and you won't get one cause it's gonna sell out in. The publishers are slacking as usual and they'll be like, wait, wait, wait. But there's probably a part of town, a few of these because they're projected numbers are off always and you want to get the, you want to get the first edition. That's my opinion, so do that and for all for for leadership training onsite beyond the books, beyond the podcast, I have echelon front. It's our leadership consulting company. We solve problems through leadership. Also, we have the muster, which is a leadership conference. There's only one more this year. It's in San Francisco.
