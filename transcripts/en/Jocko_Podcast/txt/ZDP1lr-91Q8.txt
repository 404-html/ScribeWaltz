Speaker 1:          00:00          This is Jocko podcast number 26. With Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Oh, for a voice like funder and to tongue to drown the throat of war when the senses are shaking and the soul is driven to madness. Who can stand when the soles of the oppressed fight in the troubled air that rages, who can stand when the whirlwind of fury comes from the throne of God, when the frowns of his countenance drive the nations together who can stand when sin claps his broad wings over the battle and sales rejoicing in the flood of death, when souls are torn to everlasting fire and feelings of hell, rejoice upon the slain. Oh, who can stand? Good Evening Echo. Good evening. That right there is a little excerpt of a poem by a guy named William Blake and it paints war as uh, something so powerful. So evil, something is super human in the full poem is really a statement against warning as it goes on. And it's not that much longer, but it blames war on the politicians and on the kings and on the nobles and it blames war on the religious leaders. But he asked that question over and over again who can stand

Speaker 1:          02:16          and I can actually answer that question and I've seen who can stand. I've seen people break, but I've seen many brave men and women on the battlefield stand, stand against fear and death and stand against evil stand as sin claps his broad wings over the battle and sales rejoicing in the flood of death. And that's William Blake. Those are his words, but he's writing that in the late 17 hundreds and early 1,802 he had no idea how bad war would get.

Speaker 2:          03:07          Okay?

Speaker 1:          03:10          And I'm not saying war is worse in terms of individual horror, but in terms of scale, Mick can't be denied. I mean World War One and World War Two, the scale of horror, it would be in comprehensible to two man from Blake's time, he just couldn't understand it. So let's go to June 6th

Speaker 2:          03:42          okay.

Speaker 1:          03:42          1944

Speaker 2:          03:46          okay.

Speaker 1:          03:47          As the demon spread his wings over the beaches of Normandy and men stood against his evil, the English Cox, and tried to drop the ramp a couple of hundred feet from the shore when the sergeant ordered. Take us all the way in. Just then machine guns opened up and bullets tore through the wooden sides of the landing craft wounding. Four or five men, men be began screaming, opened the damn doors. Just as the ramp went down, there was a pause in the incoming fire. We exited fast diving into the water and holding on. Sergeant Trona was lying next to me when he was shot through the wrist. I crawled over to him and gave him first aid. We just let the tide wash over the lower portion of our bodies using our fingernails to pull.
