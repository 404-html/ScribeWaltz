Speaker 1:          00:00:01       This is Jocko podcast number 14 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. Now I want you to imagine yourself in the moment, the moment, just prior to the battle. Now, I don't want you to think that because you're a soldier, that this training has made you into some kind of a superhuman or maybe you and to a different kind of being because it hasn't, the training that you've been through hasn't changed. The fact that you're a human being. All warriors are human beings. So this is you I'm talking to and I want you to think about that time before you are going into the battle because that's the time when you can actually think.

Speaker 2:          00:01:05       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:06       When you're waiting, when you're waiting to go,

Speaker 2:          00:01:12       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:14       And if you're going to feel fear, this is where you feel it because you have time, the preparation is done, the planning is done, the briefing is done, the gear is prepared and you are dressed and you are ready to go. And now you're just waiting, waiting for the call or for the signal or for the command to execute. And so you have time to think. And in fact, all you can do at that moment,

Speaker 2:          00:01:53       it's thick.

Speaker 1:          00:01:56       And if you're in Iraq, maybe you're waiting to go into the [inaudible] district or Ramadi where there's been vicious IED and casualties happening every day for months on end. Or if you're in Vietnam, maybe you're in a helicopter and you're about to take part in an air assault on a known enemy stronghold.

Speaker 2:          00:02:21       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:22       Or if you're in the Korean War, maybe you're hearing the whistles, the whistles signaling a coordinated attack by the Red Army and you're just waiting, waiting for the shooting to start. And if it's world war two, maybe you're just off shore and you're in a landing craft and the sound of explosions and gunfire in the distance on the beach where you're headed, the beach you're waiting to hit. And if it's world war one, perhaps you're waiting in Europe 10 and Burger Verdun or the psalm, but you're waiting to go over the top out of that trench and into almost certain death. And in that moment, what do you think about, do you think about family, friends? You think about your life, do you think about death? You think about that girl you, you wished that you would have asked to marry. Maybe you're thinking, how did I get myself into this? Or maybe you're thinking, how do I get myself out of this? Or maybe you're just sitting there rethinking the plan and the sequence and the orders you were given. Maybe you're thinking about your friends getting killed or wounded. Maybe you're thinking about yourself getting killed or wounded.

Speaker 1:          00:04:09       You could be thinking about so many different things, but one thing is certain, whatever you are thinking about, whatever those thoughts are, those thoughts are clear. Those thoughts or an insight into your true nature, into your being, into your soul. And maybe that's the thing. Maybe that's the thing we miss about combat. And you know, we always hear about the adrenaline rush and the excitement and the challenge of combat, but what about the cleansing of the mind against a backdrop of death? It seems like there's, there's some purity that can only be revealed by the horror and the blood and the violence of impending combat. Eh, and as you think these thoughts, and there's this moment when you realize that who's killing us is us. It's other people. It's other humans. And, and, and what are they thinking? Who are they? Why are they, what are they and what am I doing here? Why, why am I here? And despite all those Fox and all those ideas and all those questions, there's only one answer. And the politics, they disappear and the thoughts disappear. And the fears and the reservations and the concern and the ego, it all disappears

Speaker 1:          00:06:34       because at that moment, that moment of truth, there's only one answer forward, forward into the battle, into the fray, toward the smoke and the fire and the bullets and the bombs and towards death to face it or head on. And maybe maybe that is what the real addiction of combat is. Maybe that's what we yearn for. Maybe those.

Speaker 2:          00:07:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:30       Those are the thoughts that feel our dreams and are nightmares to be there again in the breach.

Speaker 2:          00:07:42       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:44       To have button one clear and resoundingly purpose for everything in our lives. Everything in our world, everything in past and present in future. All of it wrapped up into that one instant to have that one singular purpose for being alive at that moment to attack, attack with everything you have with every ounce of commitment, with every bit of clarity and focus that you as a human being can possibly muster. I tack with your weapons and your mind and your body and attack with your very soul and maybe that purity. He's a what we miss. He's what I miss about combat and so let's go back there once again, once again to the battlefield to World War One. Again, in my mind, the most brutal of all wars, war tactics and intelligence and strategy did not matter. It was attrition and death and horror rendered possible only because of the purest and almost insane level of selflessness and bravery, and this starts off in that very situation waiting for combat.

Speaker 2:          00:10:16       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:10:17       I sat up for a long time that night in the foreboding eve of battle mood of which all soldiers at all times have left report on a tree stump clustered around with blue anemones. Before I crept over the ranks of my comrades to the tent. I had tangled dreams in which a principal role was played by a skull

Speaker 1:          00:10:48       in the morning. The tender green of young leaves shimmered in the flat light. We followed hidden twisting paths toward a narrow gorge behind the front line. On the dot of noon, our artillery launched into a furious bombardment that echoed and react code through the hall though the wooded hollows for the first time, we heard what was meant by the expression drum fire. We sat perched on her habit, have her Sachs idle and excited. A runner plunged through the company to the company commander. Brisk exchange. The three nearest trenches have fallen to us and six field guns had been captured. Loud cheers rang out of feeling of up and Adam at last at last, the long for order in a long line, we move forward toward the pattern of heavy rifle fire. It was getting serious to the side of the forest path. Goal thumps came down in a clump of furs, bringing down a rain of branches and soil, one nervous soldier through themselves to the ground. Then deaths call slip through the ranks. Ambulance men to the front.

Speaker 2:          00:12:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:08       A little later we passed the spot that had been hit. The casualties had already been removed. Bloody scraps of cloth and flesh had been left on the bushes around the crater. A strange and dreadful site that put me in mind of the butcher bird that spikes it's prey on thorn bushes.

Speaker 1:          00:12:29       We entered the battle trampled realm of the infantry men. The area around the jumping off position had been deforested by the shells and the ripped up no man's land lay the victims of the attack still facing the enemy. They're great tunics. Barely stood out from the ground. A giant form with red blood. Spattered beard stared fixedly at the sky. His fingers clutching this spongey ground. A young man tossed in a shell crater is features already yellow with impending death. He seemed not to want to be looked at. He gave us a cross shrug and pulled his coat over his head and lay still in a curious failure of comprehension. I looked alertly about me for possible targets for all this artillery fire, not apparently realizing that it was actually ourselves, that the enemy enemy gunners were trying for all they were worth to hit. Ambulancemen. We had our first fatality or shrapnel ball had rip through riflemen stone. Stallers caught carotid artery. Three packets of lint were sodden with blood and no time in a matter of seconds. He bled to death in the rising mist. I leapt out of the trench and found a shrunk in French corpse flesh like moldering fish cleaned greenlit greenish Lee through slits in the shredded uniform turning around. I took a step back in horror next to me. It was a figure crouched against a tree.

Speaker 1:          00:14:02       It still had gleaming French leather harness and on its back was a fully packed haversack topped by a round mess tin.

Speaker 2:          00:14:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:11       Empty eye sockets and a few strands of hair on fire on the bluish black skull indicated that the man was not among the living.

Speaker 2:          00:14:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:21       There was another sitting down slumped forward towards his feet as though we had just collapsed all around were dozens more rotted, dried, stiffened to mummy's frozen in Erie, dance of death. The French must've spent months in the proximity of their phone comrades without bearing them. A headless torso was jammed in some shot up beams, head and neck were gone. White cartilage cleaned out of a reddish black flesh.

Speaker 2:          00:14:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:57       I found it difficult to fathom next to this very young man, lay on his back with glassy eyes and fist still aiming a peculiar feeling looking into dead questioning eyes. A shutter that I'd never quite lost in the course of the war. Has pockets had been turned inside out and his empty wallet lay beside him.

Speaker 2:          00:15:24       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:15:28       so that right there is a portion of the opening chapters of a book called storm of steel.

Speaker 1:          00:15:39       Going into the introduction of the book. It's a storm of steel is one of the great books of World War One, if not the greatest. Ernst, younger. That's the author Earth youngers book on the 1914 war storm of steel is without question the finest book on war that I know, utterly honest, truthful in good faith in contrast with most of the others is stark. It has no pacifist design. It makes no personal appeal. It is notably unconstructed book. It does not set its author and his experience in any sort of context. It offers nothing in the way of how's and why's it is pure where and when and of course above all what there is nothing in it about the politics of war, nothing even on its outcome and very little on the wider strategy of its conduct. War is all fighting is all. Everything else is cropped away and from first to last in the affirmative, it is the work of a man whom the war made.

Speaker 2:          00:17:12       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:13       So it's a little bit of a different kind of book that was someone explaining the boot, someone explaining the book and just how it is. It's just about the fighting. Yeah. So just throw just about the right. Yeah. And that's one of the things that makes it so powerful. And it's also one of the things that reflects very well what it feels like to be on the front lines. Yeah. When politics don't matter, when the outcome doesn't even matter, the outcome of the broader war doesn't matter anymore to what are we doing right now? This trench? Mm

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:17:56       Talking about being in these trenches, which he, you know, obviously all these soldiers spent an immense amount of time. They lived in these trenches.

Speaker 1:          00:18:07       Back to the book, the desolation and the profound silence sporadically broken by the crump of shells were heightened by the, sorry impression of devastation, ripped have or Saks broken rifles, scraps of cloth counter pointed grotesquely with children's toys. Shell fuses deep craters from explosions, bottles, harvest implements, shredded books, battered household gear, holes, who's gaping? Darkness, betrayed the presence of basements where the bodies of unlucky inhabitants of the houses were nod by the, particularly a city of swarms of rats in the cattle buyers and stables and Barnes, the bones of livestock still dangling from their chains. Trenches dug through ravaged gardens in amongst sprouting bulbs of onions, warm board, Rhubarb Narcissus buried under weeds on the neighboring fields, grain Barnes through whose roofs grain. The grain was already sprouting. All that with half buried communication, trench running through it, and all suffused with the smell of burning and decay. Sad thoughts are apt to sneak up on the warrior in such a low cow when he thinks of those who only recently led their lives and tranquility. So he's actually providing a little caution to people. A little caution, the warriors that when you see, you know these babies toys and there's normal village that's been ripped and Alice trenches running through it and you can't let that sneak up on you. He says that he motion, you've got to detach yourself from that. And speaking of the rats

Speaker 1:          00:20:01       here, he says they are repellent creatures. And I'm always thinking of the secret desecrations they perform on the bodies and the village basements. Once as I was striding through the ruins of Monaco monkey on a warm night, they came oozing out of their hiding places in such undescribable numbers that the ground was like a long carpet of them pattern with the occasional white of an albino, so so many rats, first of all, so many rats that it looks like a carpet in so many rats that there's actually a regular occurrence of albino rats. That's a lot of rats

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       and talking about life in the trench, we're real renaissance. Back to the book, we were real renaissance men who can turn our hands to anything and the trenches make their thousand fold demands on us every day. We sink deep shafts, construct dug outs and concrete pillboxes, RigUp wire entanglements, divine drainage systems, revet support level raise and smooth fill in latrines in a word. We do all possible tasks ourselves. So these guys are in the business of constructing their house, constructing the trenches that they live in. They live in these dug outs, which is like a lower part of the trench where they dig in, they build all this stuff themselves and that's what they do and then in the middle of that, back to the book, a century collapses, streaming blood shot in the head, his comrades rip the bandage roll out of his tunic and get him bandaged up. There's no point bill, come on. He's still breathing, isn't he? Than the stretchers bearers come along to carry him to the dressing station. The stretcher poles collide with the corners of the fire base. No sooner has the man disappeared. Then everything is back to the way it was before someone's spreads. If you shovel fulls of earth over the red puddle and everyone goes back to whatever he was doing, only a new recruit maybe leans against the revetment looking a little green about the gills. He's endeavoring to put it all together,

Speaker 1:          00:22:25       such an incredibly brutal assault so sudden with no warning given it can't be possible. It can't be real poor fellow. If only you knew what was in store for you.

Speaker 2:          00:22:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:49       Seven October, 1915 standing at dawn on the fire. Step opposite our dug out next to the century when a rifle bullet ripped through his forage cap without harming a hair on his head. At the same time, two pioneers were wounded on the wires. One had a ricochet thought shot through both legs, the other a ball through his ear in the morning. The century out on our flank was shot through both cheekbones the blood spurted out of him in thick gouts and to capitol. When Lieutenant von [inaudible] Wald visiting our sector to take pictures of SAP and barely 50 yards away turn to climb down from the outlook, a bullet shattered the back of his skull and he died on the spot. Large fragments of skull were left littering the century platform. Also, a man was hitting the shoulder but not badly. The middle, the platoon section of trench was attack with six inch shells.

Speaker 1:          00:23:49       One man was hurled against a post by the blast so hard. He sustained serious internal injuries and a splinter of wood punctured the artery in his arm that night. Two men were wounded. Qualin sport unschooling wire boot Schmidt was shot in both hands and one five and Schaefer took a bullet in the knee following a torrential downpour in the night. All the traverses came down and formed a gray sludge, porridge with the rain. Turning the trench into a deep swamp are only consolation was that the British were just as badly off as we were because we could see them bailing out for all they were worth. Since our position has a little more elevation than theirs, we even managed to pump our excess there way. So here it is, they're almost face to face with the British. They're getting rid downpour of rain and they take a little satisfaction. The fact that they can actually funnel some of the water into the British trench, that's how close they are.

Speaker 2:          00:24:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:54       The crumbled trench walls explode, expose a line of bodies left there from the previous autumn's fighting. I was standing next to territorial Wiegmann in front of the Outenberg readout when a long shot pass through his bayonet, which he was carrying over his shoulder and gave him a bad wound in the groin.

Speaker 1:          00:25:21       So this is kind of the daily life that he talks about being stuck in these trenches and it's just brutal. It's brutal. And you can kind of get the, the matter of factness that he delivers so much of this with take, oh, this guy was shot, this guy was shot, this guy who had his leg blown off each just like boom, boom, boom, boom. You know when he mentioned how he noticed someone else reacting to that when meanwhile it's just a real matter of fact to him, but right. Just the other guy reacting to it stands out, you know, that's all matter of fact. It is. And the book, which I kind of got in the beginning, talked about some of this first combat that he's exposed to when he goes on to go through, I mean just the battle, the song, which is 60,000 casualties in the first day, 60,000 casualties in the first day. You know, there was 58,000 killed in Vietnam. I mean 58,000 Americans killed in Vietnam. We're talking 60,000 casualties the first day. And in three months there was a million, a million.

Speaker 1:          00:26:41       It's, that's the whole state of, by the way, it's, it's, it's, it's unbelievable what this war was. It really was. And it's really unfathomable as I think about what these guys were ordered to do. And the fact that they did it over and over and over again. We, we have, we have more respect for human life now than we did then, period. I don't care what anybody says. We have more respect for human life now than they did then. Maybe that means were weaker. Maybe it means we're more cowardly, but just to send millions of men to their death for our river that didn't really have any strategic impact that that was true. It's it, it's, it's, it's horrible. It's horrible to think about. And so now we're getting, well, I leave that to, for people to read, you know, the bulk of the middle of the book where he goes into these details, but then I kind of moving forward here more towards the end of the book and now we're getting into these

Speaker 1:          00:28:09       really pretty fierce battles. And also what's interesting is this is when he starts seeing the enemy, like they can hear him in the other trenches, but now he start to meeting them face to face and indeed we heard on 29 November from captain von Brixton that we were, that we were to take part in a sweeping counter offensive against the bulge that the tank battle at Cambray had made in our front. Even though we are pleased to play a part of the hammer having so long been the anvil, we wondered whether the troops still exhausted from Flanders would be up to the job. That said, I had every confidence in my company. They had never let anyone down. Yet on the night of 30 November to one December, we were put on Laurie's. It's a truck and the process, we took our first losses as a soldier dropped a hand grenade, which for some reason exploded gravely injuring him and another man. Someone else feigned insanity in attempt to get out of the battle after a lot of tooling and froing a buffet in the ribs from an NCO seem to sort him out and we were able to go. It showed me that that sort of play acting is difficult to keep up.

Speaker 1:          00:29:32       Now, I've talked about this before and if you didn't go the last time I talked about it and look at this shellshocked videos of world war one on Youtube, there are [inaudible] to watch and you realize what this war did to people. And I pulled this section out because he was a guy

Speaker 1:          00:29:52       who probably had gone completely insane and he's like saying, this guy feigned insanity. He just said, you know what? This guy is faking. You know, even though he probably was, he probably was. He says, you know what? Beat this guy up. Tell them to suck it up and now we can go. And that's exactly what happened. That was kind of the attitude, right? Remember you're saying that was kind of the attitude back then? It would absolutely was the attitude. It was the attitude innate. They talk about, I mean I've, I've paid more attention to it on the British side, but Yo, if you came back from the war

Speaker 1:          00:30:28       with all your limbs and you went into a medical ward, meaning you were in there because you had psychological problems, they, it was because you were a coward and their minds. Yeah. Which is sick. It's sickening. Yeah. Yeah. I think how you were saying life met less than or where it means more like human life. I think it's just the, it was just the lack of knowledge, you know, like they've looked into it over the years and stuff and they kind of Co as far as the, as far as the PTSD and the shell shock, everything. Yeah. Everything. We've learned all kinds of about that.

Speaker 1:          00:31:05       But it is really horrible when you see those videos of what they have, what this war did to people. And that's what war does do to people. You know, we got to remember that, that it impacts people in, in a horrible way. And this war to me, especially more so than near the war, primarily because of the conditions and from the, the indirect fire, the mortars and the shelling. And again, it's something that you have no control over. And also you could see these guys had no control over their, their fate. They're going to get told to do something and they were going to do it. And if you weren't going to do it, you are a coward. You know, if you were to protest and say, hey, this doesn't seem like a good plan to me it wouldn't be well, okay, what's your strategic opinion? What your tactical loop, which your tactical brain tell you knows? No, you're a coward.

Speaker 1:          00:32:01       And that's why it's so important really in any endeavor, especially in war, but in war, in business too, to have an open mind from a leadership position to listen to what people are saying because they might be right. And here, I guarantee you there were thousands and thousands if not hundreds of thousands of soldiers that would've said, hey, you know what? This doesn't make any sense. And part of it is incumbent upon them to say, you know what? No, I mean it's like we talked about with the Polian Maxim, right? Napoleon's maximum was if you are aware of a problem with an order and you carry it and you get your guys killed, you're culpable. Nope, it's on you. So these guys obviously hadn't read that and head you don't get it. Hadn't taken that on board. Will you listen to your subordinates and you say, okay, what do you think of this plan? We've tried it 12 times in the past, you know, a month and a half and we're going to try it again tomorrow. We're going to get up at the sound of the whistle and we're going to charge towards these other enemy machine guns. It hasn't worked yet, but we think it might work tomorrow. No one figured that out.

Speaker 1:          00:33:10       Listen to your people and listen to your brain. You know, listened to your common sense. Don't get stuck. Don't get stuck in a mental Rut with anything. And it's so easy to look if you could send millions of humans to their death because you can't think your way out of the strategy. You can't identify a strategy as being wrong. You can't come up with a new way to execute something that shows you how trapped in a box your brain can get and not only you but your buddies that are all thinking the same way and you're all feeding off each other with incestual ideas that are the same ideas being fed to one another and it leads to this. Back to the book. Suddenly there was some commotion at the British Barricade, hand grenades, flu rifles, banged machine guns. Clattered they're coming. They're coming. We leaped behind sandbags and started shooting in the heat of the battle. One of my men, corporal kingpin house jumped onto the parapet and fire down into the trench until he was brought down by two bad wounds in his arms. I took note of this hero of the hour and was proud to congratulate him two weeks later on a ward of the Iron Cross. First Class.

Speaker 2:          00:34:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:37       No sooner had we got back from this interruption to our lunch that there was more pandemonium. It was one of those curious incidents that can suddenly and unpredictably transform an entire situation. The noise was coming from a Saab Altar in the regimen on our left who wanted to line up with us and seemed inflamed by a buzzard. Fury drink seemed to have tipped as innate bravery into towering rage. Where are the Tommys? Let me Adam, come on boys. Who's coming with me?

Speaker 2:          00:35:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:16       It is in snit fury. He knocked over our fine barricade and plunged forward, clearing a path for himself with hand grenades. So this guy is, you know, going after it. He's the, you know, he's described as being like almost drunk. Maybe he is drunk, but he's just standing up and charging, charging forward, clearing a path for himself with hand grenades back to the book. His orderly slipped ahead of them along the trench, shooting down anyone who survived the explosion. Explosions, braverly bravery, fearless risking of one's own life is always inspiring. We too found ourself, ourselves, picked up by his wild fury and scrabbling around to grab a few hand grenades. Rush to form part of this buzzer. Ruckers project progress sooner. I was up alongside him, tearing along the line and the other officers to followed by riflemen from my company.

Speaker 2:          00:36:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:24       Even captain von Brixton, the battalion commander was up there in the van rifle in hand, bringing down enemy hand grenade throwers.

Speaker 2:          00:36:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:34       The British resisted manfully. Every traverse had to be fought for four.

Speaker 2:          00:36:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:41       The black balls of mill's bombs. Those are British grenades crossed in the air with our own long handled grenades. Behind every traverse we captured, we found corpses or bodies still twitching. We killed each other sight unseen. We too suffered losses. A piece of iron crashed into the ground next to the orderly, which the fellow was unable to avoid and he collapsed to the ground while his blood issued onto the clay from as many wounds.

Speaker 2:          00:37:14       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:37:14       We hurt, we hurled, we hurdled over his body and charged forwards. Thunderous crashes pointed us to weigh. Hundreds of pairs of eyes were lying in wait behind rifles and machine guns in dead man's land. We were already a long way from our own front lines, from all sides. Bullets whistled round. Our steel helmets are struck the trench parapet with a hard crack. Each time a black iron oval broke the horizon. One's eyes sized it up. With that instantaneous clarity of which a man is only capable in moments of life and death. During those instances of waiting, you had to try and get to a place where you could see as much of the sky as possible because it was only against it's Pale backdrop that it was possible to see the black Jaguar iron of those deadly balls with sufficient clarity. Then you hurled your own bomb and leaped forward. One barely glanced at the crumpled body of one's opponents. He was finished and a new dual was commencing in the exchange of hand grenades. It reminded me of fencing with foils. You needed a jump and stretch almost as in a ballet. It is the deadliest of duels as it invariably ends with one of the participants or the other being blown to smithereens

Speaker 1:          00:38:47       or both hand grenade fights.

Speaker 1:          00:38:58       And just to kind of explain that a little bit, it's one thing that you, that we definitely learned in the seal teams when you're patrolling at night, and this is especially before night vision when you wanted to see the person in front of you and especially like to see their hand signals, cause we, you know, we use all hand signals at night, so if you want to see them, you kind of get down on a knee and you put the, you put the back, the back light behind him so you can see what handsome or passing. And what he's doing here is they're trying to get as low as they can and back light the sky as much as they can so they can see the grenades that are being thrown at him. And then when they do get thrown at them, they try and get up to a spot where they don't think it's gonna blow up and then their Hac, their own grades. Back in these moments, I was capable of seeing the dead. I jumped over them with every stride without horror. They lay there in they're relaxed and softly spilled attitude that characterizes those moments in which life takes its leave.

Speaker 1:          00:40:09       Now they get the, now they get the British kind of trapped the trench. They were trying to escape down, doubled back on itself towards ours, like a curved frame of a lear and at the narrowest point they were only 10 paces apart, so they had to pass us again from our elevated position. We were able to look down on the British helmets as they stumbled in their haste and excitement. I tossed a hand grenade in front of the first lot, bringing them up short and after them all the others. Then they were stuck in a frightful jam. Hand-Grenades flew through the air like snowballs covering everything in milk. White smoke, fresh bombs were handed up to us from below. Lightenings flashed between the huddle, the British huddling up rags of flesh and uniforms and helmets. There were mingled cries of rage and fear with fire in our eyes. We jumped onto the very lip of the trench. The rifles of the whole area were pointed at us. Suddenly in my delirium, I was knocked to the ground as by a hammer blow sober. I pulled off my helmet and saw to my terror that there were two large holes in it. Cadet Mormon leaping up to assist me assured me that I had a bleeding scratch at the back of my head. Nothing more. A bullet shot from some distance had punched through my helmet and it only brushed my skull.

Speaker 2:          00:41:46       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:41:47       half unconscious. I reeled back with a Hurley applied bandage to remove myself from the eye of the storm.

Speaker 2:          00:41:54       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:41:55       No sooner had I passed the nearest traverse that a man ran up behind me and told me that tab had just been killed in the same place by a shot in the head. The news floored me, a friend of mine with noble qualities with whom I shared joy, sorrow and danger for years. Now who only a few moments ago had called out some pleasant treated me, taken from life by a tiny piece of leg. I could not grasp the fact. Unfortunately it was all too true in this murder. A sector of trench. All my ncrs and a third of my company were bleeding to death. Shots in the head, rain down lieutenant hop than another one was another one of the fallen and older man I teacher by profession, a German school master in the best sense of the word my two ensigns and many others besides were wounded and yet the seventh company held onto the conquered line under the command of Lieutenant Hop and Raf, the only able bodied officer remaining until we relieved of all the stimulating moments in a war. There is none to compare with the encounter of two storm troop commanders in the narrow clay walls of align.

Speaker 1:          00:43:31       There is no going back and no pity and everyone knows who is seen of them in their kingdom. The aristocrat of the trench with hard determine visage brave to the point of folly leaping agily forward and back with keen bloodthirsty eyes. Men who answered the demands of the hour and whose names go down in no chronicle. And I think as we read these books, write these books, these are chronicles. Somebody wrote, this guy lived in wrote, but he's making a specific point here. He, he uses the term, the aristocrat of the trench. And it's not the turning of the term aristocrat that isn't, it's not the, you know, the, the snobby aristocrat. That's not what he's talking about. You know, you look up the definition of Aristocrat and one of the meanings of it is like the, the best of, so that's what he's talking about. These guys that were the best guys in the trench that had the heart look that would get after it. And yet their names go down and no chronicle. And I'll tell you, I know many, many brave men in the seal teams in the Marine Corps, in the army, brave souls that were all risk Kratz of war

Speaker 1:          00:45:26       and their name will go down and no chronicle.

Speaker 2:          00:45:29       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:45:34       Uh, later battle, two men who had just ahead of us tried to make it back over the top. One toppled back into the trench with a shot in the head. The other shot in the belly could only crawl into it. We hunkered down on the floor to wait and smoked English cigarettes from time to time. Well aimed rifle grenades came flying over. We were able to see them and take a vase of action. The man with the wound in the belly, a very young lad lay in amongst us, stretched out like a cat in the warm rays of the setting sun. He slipped into death with an almost childlike smile on his face. It was a site that didn't depress me, but left me with a fraternal feeling for the dying man. Even the groaning of his comrade gradually fell silent. He died in our midst shuttering.

Speaker 1:          00:46:43       It's that, that line, they're really caught me. Maybe he died in our midst shuttering. And it's, I think what catches you about, it's because the other, it's contracted with the other one who died with an almost childlike smile on his face. And you know, as I was thinking, when you see this much deaf, it's like, you know, when they say the Eskimos have thousand words for snow because they, they're so familiar with snow and these men were faced with so much death that they saw this, the, the varied faces of death and how different they are. Yeah. And you know, one thing that I remember from some of the older Vietnam seals talking to me about guys that had been wounded, and this is, you know, uh, in the 90s. So I had no idea anything about combat. And I remember like they were telling me, hey, you know, sometimes guys get wounded, big it shot in.

Speaker 1:          00:47:47       It does, it doesn't phase them. And it's part of, it's the physiology. Like if you get shot in a certain place, each doesn't, it just doesn't do anything. You know, you can, you can drive off and then you'll have someone else get shot in a different place. Yeah. And it just, it, there's nothing you can do about it. Like it blows their femur a part or it hits their hip in such a way that they cannot. And they were just down in agonizing pain where someone else may get shit shot on a through and through. Meaning it just goes in one side and out the other and it's almost like they don't even notice it. Yeah. Cause it, it happens so fast, happened so fast and it doesn't cause any traumatic damage. And then you have the psychological aspect where some people psychologically they get hit and they're freaking out. Oh my God, I'm going to die. And some other people or are, you know, I got hit. Just leave me alone. Hey I got this. Don't worry about me. I ain't got time to bleed. Yeah. So, so those are some situations that you are just different. And then it's the same thing obviously, when this guy sees death after death, after death, after death, he sees the variables and the various faces of death.

Speaker 2:          00:49:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:04       So now we're getting towards the end and ease. I mean, this is at a point now where they're starting to recognize that they're going to lose the war. And what's crazy about that is net now, okay, if you, if you tell me, hey, we're fighting for our country, okay, I get it. We're going to drive on and maybe we're gonna make some sacrifices. And these guys now recognize that they're probably not going to win.

Speaker 2:          00:49:34       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:49:38       And he's kind of given his guys a brief before they go into another assault. I paraded my company in battle order in a small apple orchard standing under an apple tree. I addressed a few words to the men who were drawn up in front of me in a horse shoe arrangement. They looked serious and manly. There wasn't much to say in the course of the last few days. And with a kind of sweeping this, that is only to be explained by the fact that an army is not only men under arms, but also men fused with a sense of common purpose. Probably every one of them had come to understand that we were on our uppers. And on our uppers is an expression that means it's like when you're in poverty or when you don't have the means anymore. So they knew. He knew that they were on their last legs. They knew that they were on their last legs. He goes on with every attack. The enemy came forward with more powerful means. His blows were swifter and more devastating. Everyone knew we could no longer win, but we would stand firm.

Speaker 2:          00:51:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:12       But we would stand firm. Now they're in his final battle. I had a very impartial feeling as if I were able to view myself through by not colors. You can see ease now becoming detached. Yeah. For the first time in the entire war, I heard the hissing of individual bullets as if they were whistling past some target. We were coming downhill. Indistinct figures moved against a background of red, brown clay, a machine gun spat out. It's gouts of bullets. The feeling of hopelessness increased even. So we broke into a run while the gunners found we're finding their range. We jumped over several snipers ness and Hurley excavated trenches in mid jump over a slightly better made trench. I felt a piercing jolt in the chest as though I'd been hit like a game bird with a sharp cry that seemed to cost me all the air I had.

Speaker 1:          00:52:21       I spun on my access and crashed to the ground. It had got me at last at the same time as feeling I had been hit. I felt the bullet taking away my life. I had felt deaths hand once before on the road at Maury, but this time his grip was firmer and more determined. As I came down heavily on the bottom of the trench, I was convinced it was all over. Strangely, that moment is one of the very few in my life of which I am able to say they were utterly happy. I understood as in a flash of lightning, the true inner purpose and form of my life. I felt surprise and disbelief that it was to end there and then, but this surprise had something untroubled and almost Mary about it. Then I heard the firing grow less as if I were a stone sinking under the surface of some turbulent water where I was going. There was neither war nor enmity.

Speaker 2:          00:53:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:59       Well obviously he did survive that wounding because he was able to write this book and he wrote many other books. The book is called storm of steel by Ernst. Sticky younger.

Speaker 2:          00:54:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:35       Yeah. And as I wrap up these books, again, sometimes I feel like, you know, hey, where do I compare this? How do I tie it in?

Speaker 2:          00:54:49       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:54:50       enemy. Now obviously there's lessons in leadership and stir trategy and you know, I talked a little bit about listening to your troops and keeping an open mind.

Speaker 2:          00:55:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:05       And even though,

Speaker 2:          00:55:07       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:55:08       you know, they started off in the description of this book is saying, you know, there's no pacifist leaning in this book, but something that I often remind people

Speaker 2:          00:55:29       okay

Speaker 1:          00:55:31       about, well, the guys that have fought in wars is that if there's anybody,

Speaker 2:          00:55:43       okay

Speaker 1:          00:55:44       that looks at war and says, let's try to avoid it if we can. It's the guys that have been there, the guys that have fought, we don't want to send our friends to war, we don't want to send kids to war. And I think this book is a reminder.

Speaker 2:          00:56:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:08       Of just how bad it can be and just how horrible, well a thing that war is. Now, of course that always comes with the caveat of the fact that there are things that are more evil than war and there are things that can only be stopped. There is evil that can only be stopped through the waging of war. But when you do have to go to war because the evil must be stopped, then go to award a win and win decisively. So you don't put men through horrors for nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:57:20       Going back to that, the part where you're talking about, um, guys getting hit and they deal with in different people just have different reactions when it's that kind of blow like a bullet happened so fast. I don't think your nerves really register of it depends on where you hit because you're, the bullet could go through your arm. You don't notice it or go through your arm and hit your, your bone. Graze the bone. Yeah, I could hit the bone. It could shout to the bone. Yeah, I know. I saw guys that got hit in the bone and it's devastating. Yeah. And you see guys that got through and through and your, and they're fine. Literally fine. Yeah. And so that's, you know, war is a, uh, there's a, there's a, there's a huge element of chance in it. Yeah. And you know, I actually got, there was an internet question that I got asked and I didn't, I don't think we, we brought it up, but it was basically somebody saying, how do you deal with the randomness of war?

Speaker 1:          00:58:18       Like you could just, how do you do, how do you deal with the randomness of war? And for me it's the way I dealt with the random acts of war is, is the really simple thought of I'm going to control what I can control. And if I can't control it, I'm not going to worry about it. Yeah. You can't worry about the random sniper shot. I mean, you can do everything you can to mitigate it. You know, when you're out there in the field, you know, you keep moving, moving, you stay behind, cover as much as you can. You don't came up in the same spot over and over again. You do the the things to mitigate the risk, but you can't just be dwelling on it. Right, because you can't control it. Yeah. The same thing of getting hit with a random IED or a random of indirect fire from a mortar.

Speaker 1:          00:59:01       You cannot mitigate all that risk. So what do you do? You do everything you can to mitigate it and then you know, you worry about the things you can control. And I used to tell that to MMA fighters too, and I'm, I've told that story before. You know, listen, guys are getting worried they're going to get knocked out or they're going to get caught a submission. It's a, Hey, you've done everything you can to mitigate that. You've trained, you've conditioned yourself, you've sparred, you've done Mitch, you've done everything that you can do. If that happens, you can't control it. If it happens, you can't control it. So don't even worry about it. Worry about the things you can control. The pace of the fight, putting the fight where you want it to be. Winning the rounds, being a tactician, worry about those things. Don't worry about getting knocked out. You know what, keep your hands up. Keep your head movement, keep the distance incorrect. Those are the things that are going to keep you it from getting knocked out, but you can't mitigate all that risk. You're in a fist fight and in a fist fight. Some people, sometimes people get what knocked out and in a war sometimes people get wounded and sometimes people get killed and you cannot mitigate that risk away. It's a war and you got to deal with it.

Speaker 3:          01:00:15       I remember, this is gonna sound kind of funny comparatively speaking, but um, I shot my own hand one time was what? A BB gun. You know the kind with the CLT. You don't have to tell this story to the public. You know there's a lesson in there though. It's not even a lesson. It's like less than one. It's don't shoot your hand with a gun. It was done. It was one of those ones where you know that you put the Cot. So it just changed the seal two cartridge and I was like, Hey, there's no Bibi's in here, so I'm going to see just how strong does this air feel, you know, with the brand new CEO too and there a BB in there. And so I shot it and I didn't feel anything. That's the weird thing is why I say so when I shot it and went the BB went and it went deep in there and went in.

Speaker 3:          01:01:00       I didn't see it and I saw this little kind of like our little ring, you know, like a little tab, a skin just appeared. And I was like, what? You know, like I felt the air. I was like, that's some pretty strong air. And then kind of, you know, a few seconds went by and um, I feel just this pressure, like someone's like kind of squeezing my hand a little bit with their fingers. And I was like kind of confused because I, of course I didn't, there was no BB in there. I knew that from the beginning and I don't know that. Right. Yeah. I'm saying that's what I'm thinking at the time. And then maybe, you know, maybe 10 seconds or so it just starts gushing blood and it comes to [inaudible] but no pain, no pain. And you know, and I kind of like you start kind of blacking out.

Speaker 3:          01:01:41       I think he was, I was, I was like 12 years old. Um, I start kind of blacking out. It's, and what, what happened was the B, the BB went through and got lodged in my tendons under there. So it took like three surgeries to get it out. You know, the first one, he just reached in there second when he cut a little bit and then the third one, um, they'd just cut my head open. They had to like move the tendons to the side and like grab it. It was bad. But the point is there was no pain. Yeah. Cause it just happens so fast, you know? Actually that's one point. The other point is always treat weapons as if they're loaded. Oh yeah. Never point a weapon or anything you don't intend to destroy. Oh well we know that now. I'm just making sure everybody knows that for sure.

Speaker 3:          01:02:22       Had some young listeners out there don't point guns at your hands and pulled the trigger. Yeah. That's actually always treat weapons as if they're loaded and never aim a weapon or anything you don't intend to destroy period. Those are like the official, like when you, if you go through like a gun courses, something like that. Those are, that's the first thing. Yeah. Interesting. Well you know you went through seal training so it's a little bit more heavy than a gun course. The basic principles, gun safety do not change. Yeah, and they should not change. I wish I would've known that when I was 12 thank you. I think it's a time for some, some questions from the interwebs. Yes. Questions from the interwebs. Speaking of the inner webs, we are in fact supported by on it.com and if you don't know what on it.com is or what it is, it's where we get our supplements and bunch of other supplements that that work. Not extensive information on there too. If you want to know

Speaker 4:          01:03:25       mark, you can also get stuff. Yeah. You can also get like kettlebells and collect bells, which I have and which I utilize. Yeah, tentatively

Speaker 3:          01:03:37       and not just normal kettle bells either. Yeah, let's just say that. Yeah, it's true. O n n I t.com backslash backslash Jocko. Okay. Yeah. Get yourself a discount. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 10% off free shipping on everything except for the heavy, heavy items, which are the weights and kettlebells, whatnot. Anyway. Yeah. Do it. First question, can you talk about your training schedules, roles, which is Jujitsu training sessions we call them. Was that for me or you? Explain to me what roles is for everyone. All right. All right. In the event of them not knowing, we'd be rolling. So can you talk about your training schedules, your roles, and what is a typical week? What does that look like?

Speaker 4:          01:04:28       Well, for me, you know, I work out everyday, so what that means, every morning I wake up early and I get it on. I lift weights, I do calisthenics, I do some kind of sprinting evolution seven days a week, seven days a week. And, and as I've explained to many people on the Twitter, they say, don't you ever take a day off? And I do, but I don't plan to take days off. Days off. Life brings days off. You got the broken water heater, you got the sick kids, you got sick, you got the, the car broke down, you got the event at school, whatever it is. Some, there's some reason there's some travel plans that don't allow it. So there's life will give you days off. So don't take off days voluntarily. Don't do that. Let the days off, calm through life and then then you don't have to freak out about it.

Speaker 4:          01:05:24       And you just go, oh cool, I've got a day off day to Roscoe and the travel or on an a, you don't want to miss a workout today, just going to take it as a day arrest. So, but I do, I work out every day. And part of that is going off instinct of what I feel like of what type of workout I'm going to do. And, and by that sometimes, I mean I don't feel like doing a certain kind of workout, therefore I'm going to do it because it's punishment for being weak. And then there's times where I'm like, you know what? I do not want to do that kind of workout today because I feel an impending injury. You're like, Hey, I'm going to lift real heavy today. No, not today. I'm tight. I'm sore. I'm going to not do that type of workout today. So it's a little combination of in instinct and disciplined versus freedom of, you know what?

Speaker 4:          01:06:14       This is going to be too much for me today. I don't want to lift heavy today, or I don't feel it. Sometimes I feel like lifting heavy. Right? You know, in other words, I'm maybe drained, I'm drained to do some kind of an endurance type work workout or a Mac concert. It's going to go in there and just just do some singles and the, but then some days you feel, you know, I'm man, I don't feel like putting any heavy way up to them to go in there and do something lighter, but maybe higher repetitions. And that type of things. So I'm doing that every day, you know, calisthenics sometimes and doing a combination of all three. Sometimes I'm doing one. So that's just just how I'm getting after it. And again, I think at some point I'm going to write an ebook because the publishing process and the publishing world is a real pain and, and the ebooks not, and just book an Ebook is easier.

Speaker 4:          01:06:58       It's easier to do. You do it, you produce it, you just put it through Amazon. And Amazon just says, Oh cool, you sell them. We sell. I could sell them for like three bucks and then anyone could want, some could just get it. And it doesn't have to be, I don't feel bad if I don't, you'll, if it's not the, it's something that I could do the way I wanted to do. I don't have to, I don't have to like I don't have to make it a certain length. Oh No, it man, it's three bucks. You know, it's 28 pages. That's the information I have is not, you know, if someone said, Hey Jocko, we want you to write a fitness book, then I've got to be 127 pages and it's got to have a bunch of things in it that I don't want to talk about because it's not that complicated.

Speaker 4:          01:07:39       Right? So 27 pages ebook, download it, print it out, everybody can have it cost. Three bucks. People are stoked. We're all good. People can stop asking me what my workouts are like because everybody wants to know that. I don't know why I'm not, you know, some incredible athlete, you know, so here's my workouts. And so that's what I'm thinking of doing. Um, then again, that's debts I had been thinking about actually getting someone and saying, hey, you seem like a capable human helped me write a little ebook. I'm going to tell you what to put in it and you do it. Why? So it like sounds dope or whatever you want to know. Just so it gets done. Because right now I'm just busy too busy for their fitness ebook right now. Yeah. So I got to move that up. I got to move that up on my chart cause I know people want to get out that.

Speaker 4:          01:08:30       Okay. So then on top of the working out, there's this surfing, which if there's waves I'm surfing. Right, right. That's just the way it goes. If there's good ways I'm surfing, there's not always good waves, but if there's ways of surfing, one thing I need to do more of is just go out and paddle. I need to do that. We'll just go out. So you're constantly in shape cause paddling, paddling a surfboard is different kinds of conditioning. Anything else? Yeah, just to be in shape for battling, Kinda like I've been saying, hey, if you want to get good at humping a ruck sack, then just hump a rucksack that if you want to get good at doing post two bovis well if you want to be good at paddling a surf board, you got a paddle, a surfboard. So you always feel weak when the big waves come and you haven't surfed in awhile and you feel weak because you haven't been paddling.

Speaker 4:          01:09:11       Lack the discipline. So I should be paddling more. Uh, and then we get to the, the Jujitsu, the role that Jujitsu. So our role, if I'm home, I'm going to the gym and I'm training, uh, you know, we usually do some technique. I usually get a little something from Jeff or from Dean and you know, Dean and Jeff, the, what's crazy is you can always learn something and it still freaks me out because it's not like when I say learn something, I'm not like saying that they're teaching me some new variation to the Gogo plot yet, right? No, they're teaching, like dean will say, Hey, when you put the guillotine on over here, make this adjustment. Or when you're passing the guard, do this here. Like some simple thing. Or Jeff, remember Jeff Glover was, I said, Hey Jeff, teach my son though the Darce choke. And I just watched him give my son, you know, like a seven minute class on the Darce choke.

Speaker 4:          01:10:16       Now, my son, you know, can you imagine you're getting, you're nine years old and you're getting a personal class on the dark joke from Jeff Glover, but my son, you know, he just thinks that's normal, but I'm watching it. And I remember Jeff was just going over a little details and all stuff that I did not know to go relearn in the dark, really learning the Darce choke. And so there's always these little things and I always am surprised at the obviousness of those things and actually does happen occasionally in the other direction. You know, dean was going through a slump where he's really having a hard time passing my guard and I just said, hey man, you've been doing, why just do x? And he could see, I saw on his face because he has a, a mutant grappling mind, like I saw on his face as soon as I told him that it was a thing, it was a connection made and he instantly started passing my guard again.

Speaker 4:          01:11:11       Nelson. Yeah. Damn. But um, but yeah, you get these little obvious things, you get the, you get the, the learning. So you're always trying to learn a little something and then, you know, there's the situational drills of going in and then there's, then there's the reality. Here's the reality, man. I like to roll. Yeah. I like to roll. That's the reality of it. I enjoy training, not starting, not starting in one position and going into, no, I like to train. That's what I like to do. That's what I love about Jujitsu. So I like to roll and I roll and whenever I go in, my goal is to role and the same way that I will, some nights I go in, like there was some days I go in or nights and, and you know, normal night, I just feel like we're all on slack going in rural.

Speaker 4:          01:12:02       Some days I'm like, you know what man, I'm not feeling it today and because I'm not feeling it today, I'm going to get it on and I'll force myself. That Kinda, that's Kinda like when you're a kid and um, you start crying or something and you dead tells you a, I'll give you something to cry about. Yeah. Like it's like that. I feel like it, oh, you don't feel like it. I'll give you something to not feel good at or whatever it is that it. And, and like a couple weeks ago I said to Mike, I got there and I did not feel like rolling. And I said to myself, I'm not going to stop until everybody stops. And so, you know, the last, you know, so we start with 20 guys on the mat and then after three rounds, there's, you know, 15 guys or 16 guys in the mat and then a down day 10 and then eight and then four.

Speaker 4:          01:12:49       And then it's me and one other guy. I'm like, it looks like it's, you got the last round of my friend. But I just did that to myself. It's a little form of, it's a little form of exercising a little discipline. But that being said, there's days where I go in and, and I don't feel it and I don't feel it as a different sense that I have, which is today's not going to be a good day today. I'm going to tweak something today. I'm too, I'm too worn down or whatever. And so I'll go, I'll do, I'll do some roles and then I'll just, I'll just leave it at that. You know, I won't, I won't force myself to stay on the map forever. So I do again, I used that instinct of, of what I am feeling to make a decision on how it's going to go down.

Speaker 3:          01:13:29       That's fine. One day, um, Greg, he randomly, I came in, he was like, yeah, I feel like I just feel like I'm going to break my toe today. Yeah. It sounds weird, right? He said, yeah, I feel like it. And I was like, Oh yeah, you just feel that. He was like, yeah, I just feel like it that day I broke my toe. I didn't really break it. It was like kind of dislocated or something like that. But it's weird. That's weird, right? I know way different point, but still. Um, so my workouts, I'll go through it real fast. Different than yours. I work out average five days a week, but they're not everything all in one. So I'll, if I roll three days, I'll lift. And do metcons and cardio and that kind of stuff. Two days. Really? Yeah. So, so I don't do like what do you do with all your free time man?

Speaker 3:          01:14:23       Make videos. That's right. Hang with them. I am. So you really, how many times a week do you train? Three. Three, sometimes two. Unless I'm like super busy then one dang. Yeah. But yeah, back when I was competing I was doing six and now it's like two days, not two days train. But I'll do running, lifting, conditioning and then a different session I do Jujitsu and whatever that entails. Um, same thing as you, you know, do some technique, but I'll typically, hey, how many rounds do you feel like on a typical day, you know how you'll do some technique, little book class or training session even you'll do some technique, maybe some drills, six and then rounds, right? So you'd do six rounds that solid, what, five minutes? Six, six or six, six minute rounds. You know, it's kind of like, it's, yeah, it's strange because that's one time we did like a, we had the gym was closed but we had, you know, an open mat, but it wasn't an open mat.

Speaker 3:          01:15:19       It was like, hey, we're going to train. And we did wait, we who just won a bunch of handful. You guys, you were probably there. I don't know. I don't remember. But we did six, six minute rounds, no gooey and then six, six minute rounds where you there that day? I usually don't get tired. I got tired that day. Well, I got tired that day. Yeah. The, how's it? Okay. So I, I'd go to, I haven't been taught to us in a few months now, but um, I'd go there like when they are trained for ADCC and um, I go there once a week, once every two weeks just for one. And so they do stuff like in every single time I've been there, it's been one of these things tend to six tens six rounds of 10 minutes each, 30 seconds in between one and then one minute between the next one, you know it goes through or five 10 minute rounds. Oh No. For 10 minute minute rounds and then one 20 minute route.

Speaker 3:          01:16:20       Those you get tired. Yeah, sure. I have a conditioning because when we do 20 like when I'm, when Dean's getting ready for an ECC or whoever we got that's doing the longer or the no time limit matches and I'm doing 20 his 20 minute rounds, I'm just good to go in. Yeah. I surprisingly handled what I was in. Good shape, man did it. But I think it has to do with what we talked about the other day where I'm not a really fast sprinter. Right, right. I'm not a really fast runner, but if you put a ruck sack on me, I can go for a long time. Right. And I think it's one of those like I can grapple for a long time not get tired. Yeah. I think mine's psychological where if I know it's 20 minutes, then I'm not, I don't feel like, I dunno, confined or, I don't know.

Speaker 3:          01:17:03       I feel like the hardest thing that we do is early. It was like when we shark tank, each other, you know, is when you're putting, you know, I'll be in the or one of our guys that's competing. We'll go in the middle and you're getting a fresh guy every two minutes, one minute, three minutes, five minutes, whatever the case may be. You're getting somebody fresh on you and that's where you get, that's where you get tested. Yeah. I would say a typical class, so it's like anywhere from a five minute round, six minute round, either five or six minutes, three, four or four routes. I'd say that's a typical, you know, not a training for a competition. Just to, you know, this is what we're doing. If you go four, five, six rounds, that's like, that's kind of a lot around compared to just the average I think in my experience.

Speaker 3:          01:17:45       Yeah. I let I start. I feel like I got, I got good training yet. Like six, six veterans. That's where I feel good. Yeah, that's 36,000. It's almost 40, 40 something minutes and training. That makes me feel good. Yeah, man. Yeah, that's a lot. That's a lot though. You know, you'll see guys dropping off after three rounds out, say not everybody, obviously it has to do with who you're training. Like Yay. I can train with somebody that's not that good all day long, but you can start getting the grinders on. You gotta be ready. We did. I just, Oh, and I've trained with Andy won round one and it's like literally like three rounds with, within like an average normal person on your level. Pace in the string. What's cool about Andy was Andy is, he's probably my main training partner now. I treat them all the time.

Speaker 3:          01:18:33       Uh, but for a while he didn't work out at all. He didn't like lift her knee, right? Yeah. Back in the day. And then I said, hey man, you got to get to the next level. I hate to say it, you got to do some working out. And he's an athletic guy anyways. And I just said, hey, go do a bunch of pull ups and then the next day do bunch of pushups and dips and the next day do some squats. And he's okay. He started doing it and in a month, man, he was a different dude and now we started powerlifting. So he's even, he's even morphing a little bit more, but he's won some big, he's won some big tournaments. He's got some game for sure. He did good. And the in the Challenges League minimum is challenging like second or something like that. Yeah. Good. He's great training partner. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:19:12       It's funny. He was, um, I noticed that where he was always athletic and stuff and then one time I ain't seen him for that long, but like we don't take him off and say, Hey, what, you know, what did you do? Cause you look way different right now. And he was like, oh, I just changed my eating. I don't eat like a whole, uh, containers of Nutella anymore. Okay. Gotcha. But yeah, I don't know. But yeah, that's it. Next question. Let's do it. Can you please share on your podcasts what the difference between lazy delegation and decentralization is? Okay, so decentralized command is obviously the, uh, one of the principals combat where you have in the book that we wrote, and I have a very simple definition that I've been explaining to people. Decentralized command, it's everybody leads. That's what decentralized command is. Uh, and, and obviously

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       that means you want everybody else to lead. And so this question is what's different gene being lazy and just delegating everything and what's good decentralization. So Leesie delegation number one is delegating things that are actually your job, right? Cause there's, there's some roles and responsibilities that people have. And if you take something that is supposed to be your job right and you delegate it to somebody else because you don't feel like doing it, then that's lazy. If, as a matter of fact, if you're delegating something that it's something that you're delegating because you don't want to do it, then, then that's being lazy, right? If you're actually delegating something because it's something you don't want to do, right, then you're being lazy.

Speaker 4:          01:21:01       And, and I'll tell you, it's actually a mindset to take on the tasks of the things that you don't want to do or that your team doesn't want to do. So this is like literally do elders. There's something that is hard to do or that no one wants to do, do that thing. And I'll give you an example. We had to, we had to stand watch in Iraq on my first deployment to Iraq, we had to stand watch on the prisoners that we would capture. It's, we come back, we have to stand watch on him. So I made myself and my assistant platoon commander, I was a platoon commander at the time I gave us. I assigned us the worst watch of the night, like the zero 300 in the morning until zero 500 in the morning. The watch that nobody wants because it's in the middle of your sleep pattern.

Speaker 4:          01:21:50       No one wanted that watch. I put us on that watch. We took the worst watch. So I didn't delegate the hard watch. I took the hard watch. So there's an example of the opposite of being lazy. You're taking on board the hard tasks, you know, another one is when we would go shooting and we'd get done shooting. And believe it or not, even the seal teams, you got to go pick up brass. You got to go pick up brass off the ground, all over the desert, all over the field, all over, wherever you did a bunch of shooting. And it's pretty easy for the guy that's in charge to have a meeting to attend to when it's time to pick up brass. But I would always pick up brass, you know, I wouldn't delegate Shell, the shell, the shell casings, but it's a pain. You know, it literally, yet when you're at, at land warfare it takes a couple days to pick up brass. And instead of like I said, instead of having to go back for a meeting, I'd go out there and you know, jump in there and have the crap job. Like everybody else, I'm picking up brass. So I wouldn't delegate these things. That's being lazy when you delegate that. Uh, and, and another thing I'll find is if somebody's complaining of some, if one of my subordinates is complaining to me about having to do something,

Speaker 2:          01:22:56       okay,

Speaker 4:          01:22:57       I automatically take it and I say, Oh, oh, echo, it's a pain for you to do this. Cool. What I'll do it. And it has a good psychological effect on, right? I mean it's, it's, it's each showing them that like, look man, I'm here for you and if it's too much for you, I'll take it. And I've had people literally going under, no, I got, cause that's the instinct that people have. They go, look man, I got it. And that's what I would do if I complained about something. And then I said, and then my boss said to me, you know what, if it's too much for you, I'll take care of it. You're like, no, no, no, no. So, and that's awesome. I'll tell you, there was also a little form of discipline in there, a little form of discipline of taking on board tasks and doing things that you know you don't want to do.

Speaker 4:          01:23:44       That's a way of exercising some discipline in your life and making things happen. So that's the kind of thing. All those things, that's like lazy delegation. If you're doing those kinds of things where you're getting rid of jobs you don't want, you're getting rid of jobs that you should be doing and getting rid of jobs that are a pain or are monotonous, or you think they're below you. So the opposite of that is decentralized command, right? This is where you're letting other people do what they're supposed to do. It's when you're letting people do things that will help them grow. Hmm. Does it help a person grow by picking up brass? I suppose there's a little character building and there, but it's not going to literally help them grow. So you don't need to delegate that task. Does it help someone grow as a leader to do the zero 300 zero 500 watch on prisoners know it's pain.

Speaker 4:          01:24:38       It's just, it's just unmitigated pain. So it doesn't help people grow so that that then, then you don't have to decentralize that. But if you've got something that's gonna let somebody grow, you, let them do it. If there's something that allows you to stand back and be the tactical genius, and we wrote about this in the book, you know, then, and thereby allowing me to have a different perspective on something, then I should absolutely decentralized and delegated. So if, if, if there was a mission came up and we need to come up with a plan, I would tell you to plan it. I'd be like Echo, you come up with a plan on this and then you'd go and plant it and you'd be all involved in it and you would lose the elevation that I would have. So when I come back to look at your plan, you say, here's the plan.

Speaker 4:          01:25:24       I go, hey, it looks good except for these two points. And you'd be like, man, how did he see those points? I'd say it's because I had the altitude. So that's another time that decentralized command, it's a very helpful decentralized command means letting people make little mistakes and not punishing them because of those mistakes. That's decentralized command. If I just hammer people and punish them when they make a mistake because they're not going to wanting to take any, chances are they're not going to want to take any risk and they're not going to want to lead because I've been punitive with my actions towards them. Now, that doesn't mean, and I've seen this happen. That doesn't mean if I'm going to let you go play on a mission and I see you're screwing it up, I'm just going to let you have a catastrophic failure, right? No, I'm going to be like, Hey, echo, think about this over here. Hey, echo, think about that over there. We're going to get you dialed in. I'm going to let give you some rope, but I'm not going to let you hang yourself. I'm actually going to give you enough rope to get the job done and think on your own. But if you start looking like you're going to hang yourself, I'm going to stop you.

Speaker 4:          01:26:29       The other thing about decentralized command that's positive, that's not just lazy delegation is when you let your subordinate lead so that you can focus upward, outward and forward.

Speaker 4:          01:26:42       So if, if you have a mission, if we have a mission to accomplish and I tell you to lead it, that means you can take care of that mission. I can look upward, meaning up the chain of command, find out what's going on on outward, meaning what's the enemy doing and forward meeting. What's going to happen in the future. And if I'm wrapped up in the, in the accomplishing of the task at hand from a leadership position, I can't do any of those things. I can't look out for it. I can't look out. We're like, can't look forward. Hmm.

Speaker 4:          01:27:10       You gotta let people lead so that they can become leaders. And your actual goal, and this is where people get intimidated, is too, to set them up so they can take your job. That's what you want. You want them to be able to take your job right. And people get scared of that, but you can't be scared of that. Yeah. What was that? There was a quote where where one guy was asking the other guy or something like, Hey, what happens if we develop, you know, our workers and then they leave us and he's like, it's better than not developing on and having them stay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a good point. I mean that's me doing a quote. Okay. You know what I'm saying? No, that's, that's good. And you definitely want to set your people up. Do you want to work yourself out of a job? And then you've got your other opportunities will come because people will see that you develop a team, people to see that you develop good leaders and they're going to say, hey, I want you to come and do that at this higher position and you're going to get benefit from that as well. Well,

Speaker 4:          01:28:08       Echo, can you ask Jocko to talk more about the writing process? Any ups and downs, obstacles, daily rituals and or future plans. Uh, so I know I've asked answered this question before. Mm hmm. It's very all answered again. I'm going to do it quickly. What were my, what did I do when writing? I wrote a thousand words a day no matter what. If I had some obstacles as the question had said here, I would write if I had ups and downs, I would write, if I had a daily ritual, it was to write every day. That's what I did. I wrote a thousand words a day and when you're writing a 50,000 or 60,000 word manuscript, that means in two months you've got your, you got your manuscript done.

Speaker 4:          01:28:56       The thing about writing every day, and I've said this before, is if you write every day, you don't need to rehash what you wrote before because you remember it. So you can just open the book or you can open your page. You can open the document that you can just start writing. And even, I used to like kind of lead my, leave myself a lead sentence that I knew would just, I could sit down the next day and start flowing right into it. So do that. And also I had the outline, I mean for extreme ownership that Leif and I wrote, I had the outline, we had the chapters, so I broadly knew what I was writing about and then it's just a matter of sitting down and making it happen. And when I went to college, I was an English major in college, and guess what? I sat down and wrote when it, when I had to write papers, when I had to write scripts, when I had to write whatever I had to write, I just sat down and started writing.

Speaker 4:          01:29:44       And then it's the same thing when I was in the navy. The navy, right. All kinds of stuff. You write evaluations, you right, operational summaries. You write a wards, you write all kinds of things in the navy, and I used to just sit down and it's right. That's what you got to do. You just got to get on it. And one thing about me is my rough draft might, when I'm sitting down I just start writing. It's, I know it's going to be rough. It's going to be a rough, rough draft. That's what I'm going to write. You just go, just go. And I don't care. And an misspelling stuff and a punctuations bad, but I don't care about that. I'm going to get a stop it because it's so easy to clean that stuff up later. The hard part is getting the, the f the foundational information down on the paper.

Speaker 4:          01:30:27       That's the hard part. Um, and it's easy for me to edit it or hone it later. Now as far as future plans, future books, uh, yeah, I mean Lafe and I are definitely doing a follow up, a book about leadership and we're working on that right now. So that's a common, I noticed that your text messages are always grammatically correct. Yeah. I was a, I was an English major and I took classes, I took classes like advanced grammar and syntax. Yeah. And uh, yeah, so I, it actually, I find language and linguistics to be very interesting. Yeah. And I know that, uh, Mike stro strikes some people as weird, but I really do. I find linguistics and language and the written word and the way words are combined together to make thoughts in people's brains. It's a very interesting process to me and so I was, uh, I was very interested in it and that's another reason why I, why I studied English when I was in college. It's the, it's the written word, the written word, which is a very, very powerful, very, very powerful tool. I also noticed your over youth of capital letters in your text messages. Oh, maybe that's just how you're feeling. Sometimes that's only when I'm texting you certain things.

Speaker 4:          01:32:12       Next question, like I'll see you on the map.

Speaker 2:          01:32:18       Next question.

Speaker 4:          01:32:23       Is Detachment something you do in real time or is it before or after any event? I think I've heard you describe both. Is it both?

Speaker 4:          01:32:36       No, it is not. Both. It is not both. Actually, if you think about it. Okay. The detachment that we're talking about is when you get involved in these situations, you got to detach yourself from it so that you can make good decisions so that you can see things clearly so that you can assess things clearly. That's why you detach from these situations. So technically if before or after an event, you are detached from them, right? Because they're not happening at that time. Now I guess you could be so emotional about an event that even after it happens, you could still not see it clearly because you can't detach from it. So I guess I could give it to you that, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true. And real for it. You could be so amped up about it and so nervous about it and so emotional about it that I guess beforehand you could.

Speaker 4:          01:33:21       So I guess, I guess I am wrong, I am talking about detaching throughout the process, right? But even if you're, if you have to detach beforehand, you're not detaching on the incoming situation. You'd have to detach from your current yes. Being nervous about the uncovered. Right. And that may help you prep it all. I'll talk about that a little bit, but the skill itself is being able to detach during the event. And I'll tell you, once you do detach from it, it's actually pretty easy. But to punch through that gravity that your brain makes with emotion and chaos and mayhem. That's the hard part. The hard part is to notice that you're stuck in the gravitational pull of all that emotion. So you got to pay attention to that end. What you really want to try and do is try, and it's what you just said, try and detach yourself before the gravity and the uh, the gravity of the emotions and the chaos builds up.

Speaker 4:          01:34:24       If you can detach before that, then you'd have to break through it. You're already outside that realm and so then it's, it's, it's much easier. So it's like there's quick sand in front of you and it's much easier to just see the quick stand and just say, I'm not going to step in there than it is to walk in there, go up into your waist and start feeling getting sucked down and then decide, oh, I'm going to pull myself out of that. It's a lot harder. Yeah. So you got to look for those signs. You got to look for that moment. When you start feeling emotional or you know that it's going to be something emotionally, you got to step back from those and get, get yourself in the habit of asking yourself, what do I look like right now? What does Jocko look like right now?

Speaker 4:          01:35:11       What does Jocko sound like right now? Listen to yourself talk. Listen to the words that are coming out of your mouth and see if you're being a reasonable human or not. And I'll tell you one thing that I, I do, I kind of see is, you know, when I'm in the movie, the Terminator, when he sees like the, the various responses he could give. Well, when I'm feeling, when I'm really good in a very detached mode and I'm having a conversation with someone, I like see the options in my head of what I could say to him and I, Oh yeah, that'll make them mad. Oh yeah, that's too authentic. Okay, that lots of good one. Hey Buddy, blah blah, blah, blah. So I think that that mindset kind of works pretty good. But again, look for the signs. Look for the quick sand look for the emotional quicksand and don't step in it.

Speaker 4:          01:36:10       The emotion of the anger, the frustration. There's little physical signs too. When you start feeling the sweat beading up, when you start feeling hot, like you literally start feeling hot. That should be a big red flag. Yeah. That warmth that flushes through your face, that's not good. Yeah. The breathing, when you start getting, when you're breathing starts increasing, your pulse was going. That's the stuff. You got a notice to say yourself. Oh, there it is. There it is. That's the quicksand of emotion and confusion and chaos. You don't want to step into it. You want to pull yourself back. We'll take away. There is like be like the terminator. No, I'm not saying be like the terminator. That was a, that was a comparison of thinking of being able to visualize the options that you have and if you're emotional, you don't think like that when you're emotional, you're just, you're just blurting out whenever he's going to come out of your mouth, but when you're detached a little bit, you okay.

Speaker 4:          01:37:13       I could say this. I could say that, oh, this is answered three and we say it. It's like a problem solving tactic. It's interesting because on the terminator he blurted out analytically, he blurted out an emotional response because he was acting like a person. You remember that? You remember what he said? I don't to profanity when he's in the thing he's looking at, he's all shot up and the superintendent or whatever the whatever it's knocking on the motel door. Okay. Hey Buddy, you got a dead cat in there or what? Cause all these flashes riding off. So he looked through his responses and they're pretty funny. If you read them, I forget exactly what they are, but he goes the like, the one he chose was, fuck you asshole. That was it. Instead of, well, you know. Yeah, I do remember that. Yeah. That was pretty dope.

Speaker 4:          01:37:57       The fake emotions, which sometimes, which I've talked about before, sometimes you got to use the fake emotions. This switcheroo. Yeah. Or is that what's good for the goose is good for the no, it's like when your kid is not getting, you're not listening to what you're saying. You're not having the impact that you want to house. You got to show a little bit of anger, turned up the heat. That's kind of good too. And don't get crazy with it. Right. As far as with the kids where if you show anger, not only is it like a powerful thing and they're like, oh shoot, this is powerful. It demonstrates to them that you care about what what we're talking about right now. I care about it rather than, you know, rather than I'm just a machine. A robot. Yeah. Yeah. I don't care. But I know I'm supposed to tell you this kind of feeling. Next question, how do you deal with being evaluated specifically by different people with different, a PD since and motive. Oh, how do you deal with being evaluated? Well, I can tell you right now, nobody likes being evaluated, right? Nobody. Mm. Now you might get somebody that says, oh, I love being coached and, and there are some people that are pretty positive about that. And as a matter of fact, I have clients where they want to be coached. Right. But most people, especially in a normal environment, like if you go out new hires, someone to coach you. Okay,

Speaker 2:          01:39:21       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:39:21       But most people in a normal environment, they don't like being evaluated. They don't like being judged, always judging. So the first thing you have to do when it comes to being evaluated is get that in your head that you like. Everybody else has defense mechanisms and they're going to flare up. As soon as somebody says something critical of you have, soon as somebody goes to evaluate you, your defense mechanisms are going to go up. And then once that happens, once you feel those defense mechanisms go up, you got to put your ego in check.

Speaker 2:          01:39:59       Hm Hm.

Speaker 4:          01:40:01       You got to put your ego in check. And then once you do that, you got to listen,

Speaker 4:          01:40:08       Liz. I know it sounds crazy. Listen to what they're saying. Don't even, don't even think of a response. Say to yourself, you know what? I'm not even going to respond. I'm only going to listen to what they're saying. Yeah. But, and, and to kind of, you already can't even take it. No, no, I can't take it. Oh, I'm saying, but I think because people will will quote unquote do that, but they won't really do it. As far as, I'm not gonna say anything. I'm just going to listen. Yeah, that's actually, that's actually, that's actually how they set it up to look. I'm not going to say anything. I'm just going to listen. Yes, exactly. What I'm talking about is like you don't, or they'll all body language, you know the kind where they're like, you know, they'll do that kind of stuff. Don't do that.

Speaker 4:          01:40:50       We'll not do that. So you're right. You got to, and not just listen, but truly listen, not listen just with your ears, but listening with your mind and your brain and with an open mind, an open mind, and then think about what people are saying and then see it is important. See it from their perspective. Because if you just see it from your perspective, you're not even seeing what the criticism really is. You're only seeing the defense of the criticism. So actually get in their mind and say, wow, what does this look like from their perspective? Why would they be taking the effort? And the risk and the challenge of trying to present this problem to me if it wasn't important or are they just doing it just to make me mad? No, they're trying to help you. And you know what just like, just like a joke, you know they say like every joke has some little truth to it.

Speaker 4:          01:41:45       Every little criticism. Even if the person is your arch rival, their criticism is built on something. Yeah. So what is that reality that you can take away from it even though you've got to take it with a grain of salt, especially if the person, like it says here, if the person has different opinions and mode as well. Of course they have different opinions. You want people with different opinions. Maybe they have different motives. So maybe you think they're trying to usurp your authority or something like that. So you maybe you got to take it with a grain of salt, but find the grain of truth in there too and find what it is from their perspective, what the problem is and learn from it. And one of the most beautiful things about this is you take the criticism and you make adjustments. You know, how do I deal with about being evaluated? I try and accept the evaluation and make adjustments to improve myself as a human.

Speaker 4:          01:42:45       That's how I deal with being evaluated. And I'm not saying I deal with it anybody better than anybody else because everybody gets defensive, myself included. You know, we had a little conversation when we started tonight, right? Sure. You said I repeated some stuff on the last podcast allegedly and you know, and then we talked through it and then I said, you know, and you know, I noticed that your camera work was a little bit off and you know, it was just the point. My point was just approved. How defensive we all get. We all get, and you know what I did? I said, you know what? I noticed that too, you know? But as far as me repeating, there was a couple little sections and it was because we pull, I pulled from multiple different books and they had a little bit of overlap and looking back on it probably shouldn't have. But at the time I thought, you know what? This is emphasizing really important points. Yeah. But still people don't want to hear the same thing over and over again. So I probably shouldn't have done that. So guess what criticism accepted on. I will adapt,

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       adjust and I will make improvements to my game based on your criticism of my technique, my skill, and my life. I didn't accept your criticism about the camera work. No, you don't. You know, you don't know anything about my there it is him up framing it is who are you to tell me? Yeah, tell echo anything. Can't tell Leco anything. Take their criticisms. Fix the problem. That's what it's all about. Your use them to get better. Next question, Jocko. Echo. What are your guilty pleasures other than donuts? And by the way, I don't even like donuts. That's pure echo right there. Yeah. You were talking about yet a donut delivery it, sorry, let me finish the question. What are your guilty pleasures other than donuts, Jocko? What do you do when you momentarily give in to a vice or something that you know is bad for you meant?

Speaker 3:          01:44:44       I liked it. I liked the fact that the people that are asking this is actually two questions in one. I appreciate the fact that this person says, Jocko, what do you do when you momentarily give into a vice? I appreciate that as if I'm this person that could only for a fraction of a moment given to any form of advice because I am not a human, so I appreciate that. I appreciate about this two part question. The first part asks both of us, specifically Jocko and Echo, what are your guilty pleasures? The second part asks other or the second part asks Jocko overtly excluding my name. Jocko, what do you do when you momentarily give into a vice? It's something that you, and the way I see this is that you do something about it. If you momentarily given me, if I'm momentarily given like no, no one want to hear my advice cause it probably doesn't work.

Speaker 3:          01:45:40       Oh I thought you were to because it's just game over at that point. It is getting over this one. Uh, or you could take it that the fact that they don't even think you ever break. Yeah. Yeah. But then again, you're talking about eating just leaves Oreo cookies on here. So that's an issue. Uh, but to get down to it, what are your guilty pleasures? I guilty pleasures number one, first and foremost, mint chocolate chip ice cream, uh, and especially mint chocolate chip ice cream milkshakes. And I do some twisted things in my brain to kind of convince myself that those are actually good for me and that they contain you just enough carbs and there's approaching in there and there's some fat. It's actually like a full good meal, which is just a big lie cause it's a big sugar bomb, like a supplement. So, but I do, I do, uh, you know, I love mint chocolate chip ice cream. I really love chocolate milk too. And, and there's been these articles floating around the Internet best posts you can get. And it's another thing, it's like, okay, but

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       the reality is it sugar in milk and they had it. So again, I'll, I'll twist that one in my head and sometimes for 10 minutes I'll convince myself that really that is the right thing to do. Right. Uh, obviously we've discussed on here before those little damn a principal wrapped hot dogs that they serve in the airport that have some kind of butter or something on them that just, damn, I don't know who invented those things, but God bless him. And then, you know, you know, the normal crap foods, the potato chips, the French fries, the whatever, the junk. Okay. So am I, he immune to the genetic evolutions that human beings have been to through that make us desire sugary foods and the endorphins going off and firing your head? No, I'm not immune to those things when I, and I'll tell you when I do, first of all, I like to earn those things, right?

Speaker 4:          01:47:52       I either earned them on the front end or the backend, like one way or the other. Like I either busted my ass and it did a couple of days of hard working out and all of a sudden, um, you know, I'm out with my good and we're swinging by and all of a sudden I see there's a little ice cream shop in the corner. You know what? Hey, let's get a little ice cream. There's a little little go time. And, and one thing that I, when I do it, I don't like have guilt when I'm sitting there. I don't know. I'm not going, oh my God, I can't believe I'm doing this. No. I say, man, this is awesome. This does ice cream. Milkshake taste great. That's great. But later on the, either that night or the next day, I earn that thing, put a little punishment in place. Little punitive reprimand for slack behavior.

Speaker 4:          01:48:39       And, and I'll tell you the thing you gotta be careful of is that it is a slippery slope. And as you mentioned, like one potato chip can lead to 20 and it does lead to 20. And even that is like, okay, understand we had a, we had a derailment, right, but don't let one day of bad food lead to another day of bad food and no working out [inaudible]. That's what happens. That's what makes you sign off the rails and it, and actually, I mean there's like Tim Ferriss, he's got that thing where he does, it's something like six days in a row of eating super clean and then on the seventh day you actually, it's not just GPA, you have to like just get after it because your body has to get the shock of carbs and all this stuff. There's another big lie. Like you can tell you, you can twist your day all of a sudden be like, well, you know first dude, but you do have to be careful of the slippery slope.

Speaker 4:          01:49:44       That for me, that's what, that's what I happens. I think. I don't believe in this stuff that you know you, you use up your willpower throughout the day and you use up your discipline. I believe that your discipline decisions create more discipline decisions. Now if I do just have a disaster of a day or if I have, let's say for whatever reason, I have a two day just gluttonous train wreck binge where I'm just, where I just for whatever, I lose the bubble, you know? And there's could be anything, any number of things that could cause that maybe, you know, it's like multiple, I don't know, bad situation with travel than with an event than with something. They'll come home and it's a birthday party and they there the only thing that eats pizza and I'm like, you know what it is and it's just done.

Speaker 4:          01:50:35       Right. Is it better to hold the line yet is, um, but if I do, everyone knows situations, then I'll usually react to that. You know, I'll earn it later. I'll, if I go on a just a terrible food thing, I'll do some kind of a fast, I'll do like a 24 hour fast, maybe in a 48 hour fast. I haven't done a 72 hour, but I'm gearing up to do a 72 hour. What do you just drink? Water? Yeah, just drink water. Just drink water. I did the 48 hour and it's at, it was actually nothing. It was like, no problem, no factor. I did everything normal squatted, went surfing, did Jujitsu, there's some guys on the mat and I said, I was talking to big Eric, you know, big Eric and as, hey, I got to tell you something, when we get done training, this is after, this is on the second day of doing it.

Speaker 4:          01:51:20       And so we trained a bunch and you know, it was no factor. And he's like, what were you going to tell me? And I said, I haven't eaten for for 48 hours. And I said, you know, I'm just trying this out and I feel completely normal. So, uh, so that's, that's one of the things I'll do a government, I'll just do some kind of, you know, psycho kind of hardcore workout. Um, you know, we, a body in motion tends to stay in motion and a body at rest tends to stay in rest. Don't let the momentum start going the wrong way, you know what I mean? Get that body back in motion, get back on track, snap yourself back into the discipline, you know, crush some workouts, get after it and get on that path, the path of discipline and strength and stay there. You mentioned the, the giving into the brain that you are evolved to have or whatever, you know, and that's like seeking out sugar and fat and you know, fat's not bad, right? But that's what your evolved to want. And it's for a reason. So, you know, put simply back when you're a cave caveman, you didn't know when the next meal was coming from. So you know, you get that honey or sugar that that means much. Eat as much as you can. So your brain's still like that. Um, so a good tactic, and I use this crazy crazily, it worked. It worked for drinking. Know I mentioned this too before,

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       where you just understand that your brain is in a way playing a trick on you. And if you give in literally by this model, you just felt for a trick. And so now you know that, right? So you're, you're falling for a trick that is played on you by your own brain because it thinks it's, you're still a caveman. So you see these donuts or cake or I dunno, pizza, something delicious and fatty. You mean what you had for dinner tonight? He's seen my dinner. And your brain is, hey, is this is one of those situations though. It's your daughter's birthday party, right? You got the family over, what are you going to do? Put them all on a Paleo Diet for the evening will tell you you're can get him some pizza and ice cream and it's all good. And it's a little bit a cake for Echo Gerald.

Speaker 3:          01:53:32       Basically that was lunch and then I had a salad for dinner. Okay, good, good. Good job. So you disciplined, you're here to back on the track. But so if you, you understand that you're, you just fell for a trick right there. Um, so now going forward, you know, we're okay if I have these cravings or you know, that donut looks delicious, whatever way, um, you're gonna, you're about to actively and consciously fall for a chick right now. There. There's no scarcity of food right now. There's an abundance of food. And you know, it's a perfect phrase for this. Don't be a sucker. Yeah, exactly. Like, like how often is he like, yeah, that's like the one of the worst thing someone can tell you that hey, you are a soccer and that's why it worked for you. Yeah. Don't be a sock. Yeah. So don't be a soccer to that piece of your brain that's trying to trick you into wanting stuff that's actually bad for you.

Speaker 3:          01:54:26       Yeah. So yeah. And so how the trick works is your brain is saying, hey, those donuts, those are, those are beneficial. And look at all these benefits. You'll get your calories, you know, who knows when they're going to come. That's what your brain is. That's how it feels. They're going to come when you ordered Domino's. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's the reality. But your brain brain's not telling you that it's given you a crate because you need all those calories. You don't know what it's going to come and look at all these benefits. It's going to taste good. And they said, this is what you need. That's what your brain is telling you. This is what you need. But the reality is you don't live in that world anymore where you can get as many donuts as you want. No. So it's tricking you into thinking that the short term benefits are the benefits when in reality, since the world we live in now is different.

Speaker 3:          01:55:11       The longterm benefits of the benefits. Yes. And they don't involve donuts or drinking. Don't be a sucker. Don't be a sucker. Yeah, it helps me. It helps if you care about being a sucker though. That's the thing. If you're like, I don't care about being stuck and there's no way to be like in another way though. That's what I think too. That's what I think too. All right, next question Jocko. Is Buds the right filter for the kind of people you want in the seal teams? Does it filter out good people and letting the bat

Speaker 4:          01:55:46       so buds is the basic underwater demolition seal training and

Speaker 4:          01:55:53       it does a decent job and I'm not going to say that everybody that makes it through buds is a guy that you want to work with or even a guy that you want on your team because one thing that happens in buds is that punishment is dealt out, right? I mean it's just suffering. It's just hard work. It's, you know, putting a boat on your head and being cold and wet and all this stuff and you either embrace that and crush it. That's one way to get through. That's the way you should get through. But there are guys that they, they find a way to get buy in, to sneak by and to work the system. Right? It does happen and those guys definitely exist in the teams. Then the real team guys know who those guys are. But the one thing that's hard, it's hard for a civilian to know the difference because two is really going to seals the seal seal.

Speaker 4:          01:56:45       If you have your tried and you're a seal, you must be a bad ass. So what is it like kind of like when your coaches saying, okay, everybody push ups for you know, 60 seconds and he's looking around and when you see he's not looking at you, you just kind of cruise, there's sacrifice, there's all kinds of guys, there's all kinds of little corners that you can cut. There's things you can get away with. And the weird thing about buds is, and I think Lafe talked about this when he was on the podcast is, or maybe he didn't, maybe we just had it in conversations. But you have a mentality when you're going through buds is that you're, you're a team and you're trying to help everyone get through. And so you don't like rat those guys out when you see him cutting corners, you, it very seldom do you wrap one of those guys out.

Speaker 4:          01:57:29       Unless it's just a, an atrocious case. Most of the time guys are, you know, like, hey man, are you okay? Like, Oh, in instructors coming, like they'll help people skate through, right? So it's, it's, it's pretty negative when you get through buds and you're in the seal teams then, then you know, everyone says to a man will say, oh, I wish I wouldn't help anyone get through because now they're in the teams and now we can't count on them and now we've got to carry their weight. So, so, so it is definitely a test of making it through. But there's two ways to make it through. You can crush it and survive it or you can sneak through it and skate through it and it does happen. Now it's also mainly a physical test and people talk about, no, it's mental, it's physical, right? Yeah, there's a mental aspect to it. No doubt. And if, and if you're not mentally

Speaker 4:          01:58:27       committed to making it through, then it's going to be hard for you. But it's primarily a physical test and physicality is actually a small part of being a seal. Now of course it's like a baseline factor. I mean it is a factor as a CEO, you gotta be able to do the job physically, but that's the baseline, right? And being a good athlete is definitely does definitely not automatically make someone a great seal because there's guys that go through buds that are studs physically and we get the seal teams. They're not good, they're not good seals. They, they might be a bad leader, they might be unsafe or they can't shoot or they can't handle the pressure or they can't handle the grind because you get a guy that's an elite level acts athlete and guess what? He's used to elite level of food. He's used to elite level of, of treatments.

Speaker 4:          01:59:26       He's used to an elite level of rest and you get to the seal teams and there's no elite food. There's no elite treatment, there's no elite rest. There's just grind and you're out the desert and you're just going on in the operation after operation after operation. In some of these high level athletes, there's such a fine tuned machine. It's like we talked about before, they're like a Porsche or a race car and what you want to be as a four by four. Like you can put diesel or biofuel or whatever into that engine is going to keep running. You have to put the high acting clean stuff into the sports car. And some of those guys break down on that. And, and, and the reason is, like I said, it's because the seal teams is not buds training.

Speaker 2:          02:00:04       Mm.

Speaker 4:          02:00:07       And I've said this before, no one in the seal teams cares about buds turning. Once you've, once you've gotten through buds, it's like as normal as brushing your teeth, like everyone's done it. No one says, Hey, did you brush your teeth? No, we all want to her teeth. We all went through buds. It's not that big of a deal. Um,

Speaker 4:          02:00:26       one thing that buds does do good though is it does do a good job of finding people's weaknesses and whether it's swimming or whether it's running or whether it's the obstacle course or whether it's, whether it's lack of sleep or being in the water and the water work that they make you do. If you have a weakness of any of those areas, it's going to, it's going to show, it's going to show. But again, some guys do find a way to make it through and they end up in the teams and they end up doing a couple of seal platoons. But

Speaker 2:          02:01:00       okay.

Speaker 4:          02:01:01       Again, being just being a seal doesn't make you a bad ass. That's just the truth. It doesn't make you a great leader. It doesn't make you a tactical expert. It just doesn't, it means that you made it through the training and you survived a couple seal platoons. That's what it means. Now there are plenty of seals that are bad ass and great leaders and definitely some tactical experts, but it certainly isn't every seal cause there's a bell curve in the seal teams. A bell curve. Just like any other group of people or any other organization. And at the top of the bell curve, you got a bunch of relentless on stoppable warriors that carry more than their share of the weight in the teams. And these are the guys that have built or are building the reputation that the seal teams have. And then in the middle of the curve, that's where you got the bulk of the guys. And these are great guys. They're great seals, they do the job and they do it well and they're outstanding professional combat troopers who get the job done and they get a job, they get the job done on time and on target. And those are awesome solid guys that maintain the reputation of the seal teams. They maintain it.

Speaker 2:          02:02:29       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:02:30       And then you got the crew at the bottom and these are the guys that slipped through the cracks. They work the system and while they're technically classified as seals, these aren't guys that are like respected by other guys in the seal teams. And quite honestly, these are usually the guys that talk the most and brag or boast about being a seal. And these are the guys that they don't build the reputation or maintain the reputation to seal teams. These are the guys that live off the reputation of the seal teams.

Speaker 2:          02:03:04       Hmm.

Speaker 4:          02:03:05       When in all likelihood they probably haven't contributed anything themselves to that reputation. Hmm. Leeches.

Speaker 2:          02:03:19       But

Speaker 4:          02:03:20       that is what it is. And, and as I always say, the teams gave me everything, the good, the bad and the ugly. And I wouldn't, I wouldn't change a thing. I love the seal teams, the frog man, the Awu gunner in a seal platoon, the point man, the corpsman, the radio man, the rear security, the platoon chief and the LPO and the OIC and the Aoi. See those guys, those guys in a seal platoon, the ones that carry the weight and carry the torch, those guys are in my blood. I love those guys that are always well, okay. Uh, last question Jocko. What does discipline really mean? You know, besides waking up early and how do I employ it to all aspects of my life? What does it really mean? Yes, discipline it. It does start with waking up early. It really does.

Speaker 2:          02:04:39       Okay,

Speaker 4:          02:04:41       but that is just the beginning in, I always say that discipline is the root of all good qualities, but you have to absolutely apply it to things outside of just waking up early. It's, it's everything. It's working out every day, making yourself stronger and faster and more flexible and healthier. Discipline is eating the right foods to a few. Your system,

Speaker 2:          02:05:17       it,

Speaker 4:          02:05:18       it's about disciplining your emotions so you can make good decisions. It's about having the discipline to control your ego so your ego doesn't get out of hand and control you. It's about treating people the way you would want to be treated and and doing the tasks that you don't necessarily want to do, but that you know will help you or help your team. It's about facing your fears. Takes discipline to face your fears so you can conquer them. And that's what discipline is. Discipline means taking the hard road, the uphill road to do. What's right for yourself and for other people. It's so often the easy path, the easy path that calls to us to be weak for that moment, to break down for that moment to give in to the desire and the short term gratification. But the discipline will not allow that. The discipline calls for strength and fortitude and we'll, it won't accept weakness, it won't tolerate another breakdown. The discipline CANSIM like it's your worst enemy, but the reality is discipline is your best friend. It will take care of you like nothing else can and it'll put you on that path,

Speaker 4:          02:07:25       the path to strength and health and intelligence and happiness. Most importantly, it'll put you on that path,

Speaker 2:          02:07:41       okay

Speaker 4:          02:07:41       to freedom and I think that's all we've got for tonight.
