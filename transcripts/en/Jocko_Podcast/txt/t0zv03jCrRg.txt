Speaker 1:          00:00          That you got an opportunity here, your, your mentor disappears for long stretches. Good. Let him go take a long lunch boss. I got it. Oh you want to assign me these menial tasks will eventually he, if he's going to take all of these breaks, then he's going to have you do the more meaningful work. So that's fine. Um, you, you can do better work than him. Good. That's going to be fine. That's going to show through eventually he's well connected up the chain of command. Beautiful. Beautiful. Cause if you can now build a relationship with him, you're going to be well connected to and that's going to be the hardest part, right? The heart that's gonna be, it's gonna be hard to do and it's especially hard to do because your attitude right now is negative, right? Your attitude right now is negative. It's a little ego kicking in.

Speaker 1:          00:52          I can do better than him. He's, I'm under utilized. He's has, he does things or he's making me do things beneath my capabilities. So those were all just ego. It's fine. You go, there's a good, he goes, got a lot of positives to it may be what's driving you to want to do better. So it's okay, but you're going to have to overcome that in this scenario, in order to build a relationship with this guy, man, I built relationships with guys that I hated. You know, I mean, cause guess what? Does that make me too faced? No, you know what? It's my job. I'm a professional. I am a professional. I guarantee you, you come and work with me. You will see I am a professional and yet I will build relationships. So, so not, and yet, but so that means my job and my professionalism is more important than my ego and my, and my, uh, my create a calorie of other people, right?

Speaker 1:          01:54          I'm not looking down on him going, I'm so, cause what I wanna do is build a good relationship. So when we build that good relationship with him, now he's, if he's well connected with the folks up top, they're like, oh, what's up with Billy? All Billy's good to go, man, he's doing a great job. Now, what if you're like, well, the thing that the other, so once you got to be careful of what you don't want to do is create an antagonistic relationship with them. And that includes threatening him with your work ethic, threatening him with your performance level, threatening him with your skills so you almost have to throttle back just a little bit enough that he's not threatened. Now the other thing you can do instead of throttling back is what you do is you give them the credit, the credit, and you give him the credit and you're good, and now he's like a pumped.

Speaker 1:          02:44          He's not looking at you become you. Build the relationship. That's what we want to do. We want to build a relationship and we want to put your ego in check. Do the little menial tasks. Learn as much as you can and let me tell you all this is you will rise to the top. If you do it right, you will rise to the top. If you screw it up, you will never rise. If you create an antibiotic antagonistic relationship with him, you will not promote. You will not. If you do it right, you will end up above him in the chain of command. It will take time. It will take swallowing of pride, but it will happen. It might take five years. It might take seven years. It might take nine months. I don't know. But that's what you have to do to make it happen and have fun doing it.

Speaker 1:          03:33          If you're going to go crazy every day, if it hurts you so bad, I make a game out of it. I mean, I'm going to make a total game out of it where my goal is to build this relationship with this guy. I'm going to make a game out of it. We're going to have fun with it. I'm not going to be angry when I come home from work and go, God, I can't believe I had to shake his hand. No, I'm going to come back like, you know what? Hey plug. Talked to my wife was a, Hey, guess what? He actually bought me lunch today and we were laughing about the football game. I don't even like football. You know what I mean? I'm gonna, I'm gonna build that. And I'm going to win. And in the long run you're guaranteed to win if you can play that game.

Speaker 1:          04:09          So again, everyone thinks it's going to be like are you, does not me. Cause I was in the military, you just not meet the standards. What you do is you smash him and report them up the chain of command. Oh that good luck with that. You have this guy as well connected and has relationships with Amy where they're going to go and look. Shut up. New Guy. Yeah. Cause you're actually proving not only, you're actually proving when you do this, you're actually proving that you're not a good leader and that you can't put your ego in check. You're proving that you can't, you're proving that you can't work with some people. We have that Guy Yo Jocko, he, oh add Taco can't work with anybody. Junk was really good. As long as he's working with, you know his team. So what does that mean? It means you're confined for the rest of your life of only working with your team. Yup. Whereas if it's, hey, Jocko was good to go, he can work with anybody. Oh, he worked with bill who is an EGOMANIAC and he worked with Mike, who is a lazy bastard. Guess what? It doesn't matter where you put Jocko. He's going to get it done. Okay, cool. That's the attitude we want people to have about us.
