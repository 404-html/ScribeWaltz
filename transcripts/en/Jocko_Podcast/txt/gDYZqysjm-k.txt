Speaker 1:          00:00:01       This is Jocko podcast number 47 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. And I went a little long with a couple of reviews. We've done some interviews. We interviewed JP Denelle, and I've got a ton of really solid books that I'm reading. I'm learning a lot from all of them and just getting a lot out of those books that I'm reading right now about war and about leadership and about human nature and about life, but kind of failed to answer questions for the last few podcasts. Questions from the interwebs, from everybody out there that's listening and the question had been piling up. So tonight we're going to simply dive into some questions from you all out there. So let's get right to it. Echo Charles. Yes. Question number one, what do he got Jocko, do you think that most MMA fighters have what it takes to be seals, the mental and physical, the brutal weight cut the brutal fight camp and stepping into a cage with a train and a elite opponent?

Speaker 1:          00:01:25       Well, this is one of those questions where you might think there's like a really definitive answer, but there isn't really, some MMA fighters could definitely be great seals for sure. Some of them actually wouldn't stand a chance as deals. And there's a lot of things that make people quit and not want to be seals or quit during seal training. You know you've got the Walker. Some people don't like to water, some people are uncomfortable in the water, great athletes, not good in the water. Some people don't like the cold and they can understand, they can take all kinds of punishment of physical nature, but they don't like the cold. Some people don't like heights and you get to the top of a 40 or 50 foot cargo net and you've got to climb over that little pole at the top, get to the other side.

Speaker 1:          00:02:15       Some people don't like that. Some people can't do some simple stuff like memorize. You can't memorize certain facts. And there's a, there is a intellectual level that you have to have. Some people aren't situationally aware, right? So some of these, like for instance, you know, you don't use certain MMA fighters who are real wild and it's one of their good characteristics is that they're, they're kind of out of control. It helps them do wild things and a fight, unexpected things. You can't be like that in the kill house. We'd go in live fire, right? You can't have that. Why you need to be able to suppress it and some people can't suppress it. So what you'd end up with someone is someone that's gonna have safety issues because they there to instinctual and they can't get those instincts under control. Some people might have too much endurance, but not enough strength to, some people might have too much strength and not enough endurance.

Speaker 1:          00:03:05       Some people are injury prone, right? Some people are just injury prone and it's not their fault. Many cases, but they are and, and then you take, so that's sort of the things that it takes to be in the seal teams that would, could hold up or trip up somebody that's just standard MMA fighter. Now the same thing is true with seals. That would be MMA fighters, right? Or, or could seal potentially be an MMA fighter. And there's been, there's been a few sales out of that if you don't better fought really well and good fighters and all that. But to make a blanket statement, there's going to be things that trip people up. And for instance, some guys in the seal teams there, they're not the best athlete. Their, their athletic ability is not as high as it might need to be to be a true competitor in MMA.

Speaker 1:          00:04:02       You know, whether that's, they don't have the explosiveness or they don't have the coordination of the flexibility, there's some thing that's going to make them not competitive. And normally those guys, I mean sometimes they might not be the best seals, you know, but some of those guys are super smart and so the reason that they're good seals because they're just, they're just tactically sound in order. Really good leaders, they're never going to beat people on the range shooting cause they're just not that coordinated. I don't have the hand eye coordination, but they're good seals anyways. But when you put them in a purely physical competition like MMA, I shouldn't say, well most a more physical on physical competition like MMA, they're not going to do well. And of course obviously there's a skillset, right? MMA fighters train MMA all the time. That's what they do. They train Jujitsu and boxing and wrestling and more tie in judo. That's what they do. And seals also train all the time. But guess what? When you're in seal team, you're not just training,

Speaker 1:          00:05:00       just fighting, right? You're training, shooting and you're training tactics and your training, patrolling and land navigation of parachuting in combat diving and fast roping, rappelling and waterborne operations, all this stuff. And then on top of all that stuff, which is the stuff that you actually really need to train, then they put on a level of mixed martial arts training to make sure that if you are, for whatever reason, without a weapon or if you need to handle somebody that doesn't have a weapon, and so therefore you might not be in the right to just shoot him and kill him. You got to have you all been handling yourself. So there's some level of MMA training, some fundamental Jiu Jitsu skills, some fundamental striking skills, some fundamental wrestling skills that that seals get. But it's not at the level of what a real MMA fighter is going to have. So

Speaker 1:          00:05:50       with all that, I think there is a, a good percentage of MMA fighters that would make it through seal training and be good seals and there's a good number of seals that would probably make really good solid MMA fighters if they chose to do that and focus their lives on it. Cause there are some common traits with both of them. Both of them take hard work. Both of them take some level of physical suffering. Right. Grind it both. I mean you, you've been around when we're running an MMA camps for people, it's a grind. It's a grind. It's a day in, day out grind. Now there's some luxury to that grind. There's some luxury that grind because when you're in an MMA camp, yeah, you work hard as hell from, you know, seven in the morning until nine o'clock doing your strength and conditioning. But then you're going to go home and you're going to get a massage and you're gonna get, you're gonna have some really good food standing by and you're going to sit down, you're going to relax, and then at 11 o'clock you can go back to the gym and now you're going to do, you're, you're grappling training and you're going to train really hard for an hour, maybe an hour and a half.

Speaker 1:          00:06:52       You can do drills. You'd get worn out again, and then, then you're going to go eat some lunch. You're going to relax, you're going to go back home. You're going to lay down, maybe take a little ice bath, then his little Jacuzzi. So there's some luxury to the MMA did in the seal teams. There's not, it's not happening. You're just getting ground down when you're going through the basic training and when you're going through, you know, the advanced workup training, you're, you're just getting beat down all the time. It's a grind, but both of them are a grind. And that's why I think though the work ethic that comes with a really good seal or a really good MMA fighter, there's a very strong similarity there. And the ability to take that grind is, is what I think that that intrinsic discipline is what would make the crossover occur.

Speaker 1:          00:07:38       So that would make a seal into a good MMA fighter or an MMA fighter into a good seal or a good special operations guy. Yeah. And and there's the crossover. It's ultimately just like you said, it's kind of hard to, I identify it overall, the thrilled general cause like an MMA fighter is training. Sure. He's training to be a better MMA fighter in general, but mainly it's training for an event. So knows okay it's going to be this many rounds, it's going to be this long per round. I'm going to get this much rest for this route and I'm training to win that. Yup. Real specific. So the training is, if it's good training, it's going to best train him to function in that event and give them the parameters. Yeah. Combat Navy seal, not like that parameter you straight up. Can you, a great example of this is Tim Kennedy, right?

Speaker 1:          00:08:27       Tim Kennedy's, uh, Greenbrae special forces guy and he's a complete beast, you know, and he's a great example of a guy that has the commitment, the discipline, the dedication to be a, a special forces guy. And that translates right into how he works out and trains for fights. That guy trains like a madman for fights. And I think that's a great example of somebody not only can do one or the other, he does both, you know, know real time he's in it. He's fighting November 15th. Right. That gets Rashad Evans so good on him. And I actually had like another follow on question to this, which is in the same arena, who would win? Yeah. Who would win, who would win in a fight between a UFC fighter and a seal team member. And I'll just go ahead and broaden that out to make it like, you know, a special operations guy because people put special operations personnel onto a pedestal of you know, totally being able to kick everyone's ass, which is, well to answer the question in its simplest form, if the, if there was a fight and it's mixed martial arts competition, so like in a cage what you were just talking about with a referee and that's the way it's going to be and there's five minute rounds and there's five, five minute rounds, where is he was going to win this fight barring a massive weight difference and and a rare special operations guy that has a high level of training.

Speaker 1:          00:10:03       If you take a 175 pound special operations guy that just trained like a normal special operations guy has, doesn't have any specialties, we're not talking Tim Kennedy, we're not talking to any of these guys that actually are committed and getting into it and train outside the actual discipline in their job. If it's just a normal run of the mill guy from the special operations community against a professional UFC fighter in the same weight class, it's the UFC fighters going to win. That's, those are the facts. And um, again, that's an occasion. And I know this because you know what, I've trained with a lot of really high level UFC fighters and I mean I've trained with, with Randy and Tito and I've trained with Brandon Vera and with Quentin Rampage Jackson and I've chain with Dan Henderson and Matt Front of train with Bisbing too soft trained with a lot of these guys.

Speaker 1:          00:10:58       You don't, none of them at a like all the time, although brand of air. And I used to try to get there all the time, but, and he's awesome. Um, but I trained with those guys, you know, I trained with those guys and you know, not to mention Dean Dean lister, I've been trained with forever. So I've trained and when I trained with those guys, a majority of the time I would train grappling specific so we wouldn't be just doing straight MMA. So we're training in, in a, in an arena that's geared towards me, you know, some somewhere that I'm actually good at, right. Have been trained you just for 20 years. And so when I go in the cage with those guys, or when I've trained with those guys, I'm competitive with them, you know, so, you know, we, we have good training, right? We're, we're, it's not like, yeah, we have good training.

Speaker 1:          00:11:48       It's good competitive training with all those guys. But I've been training this stuff for a long time. So my magical special operations powers, they, I know what they are and they're not real. Um, you're going to, you have to learn how to fight to be able to hang with these guys. And if you don't know how to train, if I put, you know, because I, when I trained with a regular, you know, got a seal that doesn't train, of course, you, it's Jujitsu. You fricking destroyed them. They have no chance. So when, if you take a guy that's just a normal guy that doesn't train, they're going to get their ass beat just like any other, you'd get no magical powers. Will you be tough? Sure. We'll you know, and this is good. Like, you know, you take your average seal and you start teaching her Jujitsu, they're great training partners because they're strong, they have great endurance, they go freaking hard, yet they don't quit.

Speaker 1:          00:12:30       They don't give up. They'll keep training with you until they don't tap easy. So yeah, they're great training partners that end. The more you teach them, the better they're going to get and they're going to learn quickly because they're going to be focused on it. So that's all good. But the fact of the matter is you take a skilled and, and I, you know, can you take a skilled UFC fighter and it doesn't matter that you were a quote unquote, you know, navy seal or special operations guy. That's, that's just not going to happen. So now the, the other kind of thing on this is if you take both people now out of the cage and you put them into a survival type situation, now the special operations person's going to have a much better chance because first of all, they're gonna be able to, they're going to try and avoid the bad situation if they can.

Speaker 1:          00:13:19       And if they do have to fight, they are much more likely to use some kind of a improvised weapon to do some kind of sneak attack, to have backup right in the form of other guys that you didn't realize were with him. And all of a sudden you're getting hit in the head with a bottle. It's the professional fighter. Of course, it has a huge advantage, but there will be, there is some, when you get out of the cage and there's no referee, there's, there's some things that, you know, your average special operations guys are going to be thinking about that your normal person wouldn't be thinking about in these situations. Um, so, you know, that's why I said, you know, just in general, first of all, don't get any street fights. It's not smart. It doesn't get you anywhere. And you see guys that are in the military, just in general, they kind of have another little level that they might take things too, right?

Speaker 1:          00:14:15       And that's, that's, you know, you think you're getting a little fist fight, right? And you think all of them, I'm in a borrow, was getting a little fist fight with this person. The next thing you know, someone's biting off your nose, right? Or someone's ripping off your ear or someone sticking a fork in your eye because that's the kind of thing, like that's the kind of thing that you take one of these people who's trained in that has a little switch in their head that they go, oh, I'm going to, I'm going to combat scenario right now where this guy's attacking me and I'm going to chew off. I'm going to chew off his nose. I'm gonna read off as a year, or how many gouged out his eyes? I'm gonna do it right now as fast as I can. So that's why, you know, just you got to use Costa and I got actually one of my, one of my buddies back in the day there was, we were in a bar and some guy who was getting cocky and said something to a girl and you know, he knew the girl and Blah Blah Blah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:07       And there was whatever situation. So my buddy's like, hey, hey, can you go ahead and apologize that girl, you know, cause that wasn't cool. He said it all nice. Like, yeah, like just all months and the guys, you know what? And he says, Hey, no, no problem. I just, you said something to the girl over there. You see her? Yeah, we do with the red shirt on. Yeah. You said something to her and it was kind of offensive. So if you could just go, you know, apologize to her then, you know, we're all good here and, and it, what do you mean we're all good? No, I mean if you can just apologize to her then we're all good. And you know, the guy says something like, you know, what are you going to do about? And as he's finishing those words, the guy was smoking a cigarette.

Speaker 1:          00:15:49       As he's finishing those words, my buddy in a millisecond, in a nanosecond, like faster than you can snap your fingers. He snatches the cigarette out of the guy's mouth and shoves it with absolute laser target, precision up, the guys know a burning cigarette. So this dude just, and he put it, you put it in there deep. I don't even know how he did it. Like a Ninja move. Well Baum, it's up there. The dude collapses. I mean, can you imagine? You know, I mean, you've seen people like put a cigarette out on their arm or whatever and it leaves a scar for the rest of their life. He shoved the cigarette, the burning cigarettes up, the guys knows the guy collapses to the ground and just like screaming in it. I mean, completely defenseless. So that's the kind of thing. Maybe that guy was a tough guy.

Speaker 1:          00:16:38       Maybe that guy was thinking, oh, I'm a boxer, or whatever. This guy might've been, I don't even know because the fight was over before it even started because the guy had a burning cigarette jammed up in his nasal cavity in a split second fights over. So that's the kind of thing that let's be friends with each other. Let's just try and treat each other with respect out there. So we're not getting into fights because I've got a bunch of stories like that and they don't end well, you know, if they don't end well and yeah, that's kind of like, um, like special operations guys. That's kind of an eye, I'm not that guy that you're talking about. He's not special operations guy. Right? That was just the guy that did the cigarette up the nose. Oh no, he's a seal. Oh yeah, he, when this was, this was years ago, many, many years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:17:27       And yeah, he did it just like that. And that's the kind of thing, like, again, the guy that he's talking to thinks he's a tough guy, thinks, oh, I'm a tough guy. Who, what's this? What's this little guy talking to me? Talking smack telling me you apologize. I don't have to apologize anybody. And this was also pre MMA days, but you know, maybe the guy's a boxer, maybe the guy's a wrestler, he may, it might be a tough guy, but I guess apparently when you get a burning shoved up your nose, you're not tough anymore. Just goes over like that.

Speaker 2:          00:17:52       Yeah. Even, I mean, even better then as an example, he is where first off, if the guy, you know how the, how you said he's saying it all calm like, hey, just go ahead and apologize what? It made me nervous, right? They're like, oh, this guy's cute. Anyway, but that's a side thing. So like, yeah, so a special operations guy compared to an MMA guy, he's, he's about every, he's thinking beyond the fight. He's thinking straight up, this is a battle. So how can I win this fucking war? You know, MMA fighter is thinking like when we fight, how am I going to beat you up with all my skills? And he will typically will, unless you have equal or better skills, you're going to get beat up in a fight. Yeah. So, but the tack that he liked, the other guy, he's thinking tactical, he's thinking, okay, you know, he'll probably, and according to the guys that I hang around with, when they walk in a room, just like a Jujitsu guy, when you, when you, when a person is presented to you, you're thinking you did two already, you're thinking, okay, from here a solid takedown would come a special operators, I could stick my pen in this guy's eyes and there's the door and you know that, you know, let's say, let's say other guys just came in.

Speaker 2:          00:18:53       Okay. So I got five guys, he has like eight before any fight, no fight, no nothing. This is just the way, you know, the way that kind of the mind works. And then, so yeah, if, and he's planning like the your guy, he had that planner Eddie, you know, it's not like he was like, oh, I'm just gonna attack in. That just Kinda came about during the process of the tech. He knew like, okay, he had a cigarette. That's part of my plan, my tactic, you know. Um, so yeah, when you go outside of just the site, no, no

Speaker 1:          00:19:18       too. Like you think about you, you know, the Applegate, rex Applegate, the whole idea of, of self defense being gross motor movements instead of fine motor movements. So if you ever look at some of the old school, um, unarmed combat from the military, it's all based on this idea that when you get in a fight, you want to do these big gross motor skills. In other words, just giant movements with your fist and with your legs. So there's no really fine motor skills because when your adrenaline's pumping and you're in this fight, you're going to make little mistakes. Imagine the fine motor skills it takes to grab a cigarette and it up someone's nose in a split second node. Uh, you know, there's another story and I don't know why Tim, Tim Kennedy and I, we talked about it before we came on the podcast and we did, we didn't get to it.

Speaker 1:          00:20:05       Maybe we'll talk about it next time cause we reviewed the whole story and it's a great story. As you know, he trained at the pit in San Louis Obispo for awhile and seals used to do training up there and one night and all the guys that trained with Tim at the time, um, they all used to work as bouncers. And these guys are pro, I'm going to say, I wish I could remember the names of the crew, but it's basically the old school St Louis Obispo pit crew, right? So it's, I want to say Gan Mcgee, Tim Kennedy, Chuck Liddell, that crew, right? Those guys before, you know, the UFC was big. Those guys all work as bouncers in San Louis Obispo. So some were doing some training up in the area. It went out in town. I've got into a fight and they, the, the guys got their ask. The seals got their ass kicked pretty much by, and, and it was, you know, Tim and I were laughing about it because again, this is before the UFC was really popular and they got into a fight.

Speaker 1:          00:21:04       And of course, not only is it a bunch of UFC or at least high level MMA guys that are working as bouncers. So they're sober fighting against a bunch of drunk team guys. And it was funny cause I, they said, man, you know, cause he seals got their asses kicked in there, kind of like came back like, Oh man, oh no, no, these belters were tough. And then I go, well what was it? And they're like Saint Louis Obispo. And then somehow through the grapevine, through the MMA grapevine there, somebody told me back, Hey Jocko, those guys that got, it was these guys, it was guys from the pit. And I was like, oh, okay. I know that story by the way, cause a guy, he was a new guy, he was like, yeah, I'm not gonna say anything. I think he's still in his name, but he met him through the cake nuts, you know, they'd come by and all that.

Speaker 1:          00:21:46       That's how I met JP. Kind of the same way. But, um, but he would always come in the club that I worked at. And so we kind of became friends, you know. So after we're done, we're eating at the same spot and he's like, yeah, man, flu, Chuck Ladell beat me up, beat them down. But we got in a fight in chocolate l beat me up, hit him and knocked him down. And I actually, yeah, that's what happened. So that was a classic example. And by the way, you also, something about while we're talking about chocolate l uh, chuck, when chuck has always been like awesome to vets, especially wounded vets. So chocolate l Yay. If he's bouncing in a bar and you're a vet and you get out of line, you're going to get, you're going get put down. But if you're a, if you're a warrior, that always impressed me about chuck was he did some great stuff for the, for the troops had been wounded overseas.

Speaker 1:          00:22:33       And that always gave me a lot of respect for him. You know, even more respect than I have for him as being a great fighter. But anyways, that kind of answers the question. Um, and so my overall broad guidance here is train hard to do battle, but do your battles in the gym? Not In the street. It's, yeah. It's only gonna get you either put in jail or putting the hospital or both. So I remember this guy we trained with get his ear bit off, remember? Yeah. Igor WPC. Yeah. What's he in navy fill or is he, yeah, he, he got out, but yes. Yes. Yeah. He got into a street fight and I mean he, he, he kicked the guy's ass, right? He actually, I think he more Thai clinch them, put them down on the ground. Got Cross side was kind of putting the, putting the beat down on this guy and the dude just big chunk, big chunk of zero bigger than the chunk that I'm bigger than chunked out Mike Tyson to out.

Speaker 1:          00:23:33       I mean, he was a big chunk. I mean he's, his ear is clearly has a bite taken out of it. Like if you took a bite, a big nice solid bite out of a piece of pizza, that's what his ear looks like. And you know, oh cool. You won the fight, but you have no year left. So that's a bummer. And that's another thing that's another point to that is that sometimes these self defense type people think that you know, oh I'll, I'll call dries out. And that's the indication that I just kind of gave to that, hey, the navy seal Mike, do something tricky to you. Well the bottom line is that stuff is, a lot of times it doesn't work and that's a perfect case. The guy bit is you're often thinks, oh, the guy's going to give up. No, cause he's not giving up.

Speaker 1:          00:24:11       He beat that means he went even harbor, right? That means, oh, now you've got a guy across the side that's about to ruin your shoulder for the rest of your life, for the community, then put you to sleep. And it's just a bad situation. So you can't just another thing about those, those thinking that you don't need to train because you're going to do an engine mover. You're going to shove a cigarette at some guy's nose, no wrong answer. Or you're going to bite the rear off and you're going to, no, that's not, it's not true. You need to train so that you can get in those positions and that you won't lose these fights. And also you need to train so that you don't have to get in fights. Because most of the time when you're getting to fights because your ego is getting out of control and you can't send, you can't handle it in your little brain. You get all, get all insecure about who you are as a man. So you think of, we've kicked this guy's ass and then you're either getting your ass kicked, you're getting put in the hospital, or you're going to jail or you've got a big lawsuit against you. So be smart.

Speaker 2:          00:25:02       Yeah, that's rough. Hey, remember I'm bloodsport when he was like, you know the coin, you actually bill that, remember blessing that the guy with the coin and he's like, hey, you know, whenever I'm gonna, if I can grab it before you close your hand. And the girl had something to do with it and then he's like, he grabs it, he closed. Then he's like, ah, you know, I still feel the coin in my hand kind of thing. He looks, he switched the coin. That's kind of what your friend did with a cigarette when he shoved it in the guy sinus cavity. Cause it's like super fast, you know and but precise. But you can't count on that move. And that's my point. All right, kicking it off. Let's go to question number two shoe Jocko. What if I don't have time to explain the why to my troops for decision I'm, I'm making during an operation US army first lieutenant. So awesome. Thanks for your service. US Army First Lieutenant, get some and I, I talk about

Speaker 1:          00:26:05       troops and people in general never wanting a pain, a plan to be imposed upon them. And so that's, that's what this question is kind of based around. Cause I'm going to say, look, do you know you don't want to just force people to do some plan. You want to say, Hey, what do you think you should do? And Hey, here's, here's what we're doing and here's why we're doing it. This is why it's important that gets people to take ownership of it and therefore they do a better job. So he must have heard me say that. Now he's saying, look, sometimes I ain't got time to begin to be explained in the why when we're getting this going on. And that's why this idea of explaining the why is true 99% of the time in an administrative situation, in a situation where things are under control and we've got time to think about what's happening, that's when you can go and say, Hey, what's your, what's your, you know, what do you think? How do you think we should do this? This is why I want to accomplish this. This is the commander's intent. You can do it and all that stuff. And that makes sense. Again, in a administrative situation when there's chaos and when there's May Hamot and when there's uncertainty, actually the opposite is true.

Speaker 1:          00:27:11       You actually want your troops to you. They they want, they want to see and hear clear directives from you. They want to know what they should do in no uncertain terms. And it's, you can think of situations where if you've seen, let's say a car accident, right? And you see people that are kind of frazzled, if someone steps up into that situation, don't one's doing anything that they're supposed to be doing. If someone says steps up and says you to start dragging that person over, there you go. Call nine one one. They actually teach that. You know, when you, when you're learning about how to handle a traumatic situations, somebody needs to step up, step back, take charge of the situation. Everybody wants that to happen. And that's true in a combat scenario. Again, this is different from when we're in the rear and we're, we're formulating a plan and were safely going over whatever ideas we have.

Speaker 1:          00:28:06       And that's when you want to get impact, input and feedback and you let your subordinate leadership come up with a plan. That's all good. But that's not true during, uh, like I said, during a pressure situation, when there's a critical scenario unfolding, people want to be led. Now when you lead them in those situations, you can still give orders by Commander's intent. You can still just given tent. So an example of that, and I actually wrote my example down. You can say like Delta one six, we need high ground on the other side of that road, make it happen. So then the delta one, six commander goes, okay, I need high ground on the other side of the road, there's a good building. It looks like that. So we can take, hey, you know, squad come with me and they go over and take down the building.

Speaker 1:          00:28:52       I gave them a, uh, still gave him commander's intent. I gave him very clear commander's intent. I didn't really tell them why. I didn't say, Hey, what do you think would be best? Do you think it's a good idea to get high ground? No. I said, go get high ground on the other side of the street. That's what I told them to do. So I'm going to let them figure it out. They understand what the intent is. You could say something a little bit more specific. You could give them an actual, an actual directive. You could say, Charlie, one six Gig, take two squads, assault building 34 on the other side of the road. Get high ground on the rooftop, go. Now we have something that's more specific. Again, it's not commander's intent, it's directly I'm telling you what to do and a lot of times people are going to want that.

Speaker 1:          00:29:32       They're going to want to hear exactly what to do in these pressers situations, so depending on the level of experience that your subordinate leadership has, depends on maybe how specific you're going to get with just given commander's intent versus giving something very specific to do. Both of those are the right answers. If you have a good really good leader underneath you and you can just give them the intent and you can let them come up with a plan, cool. Go with that. If you've got somebody that needs a little more guidance, give him a little bit more specific guidance. Now obviously, one part of that is you got to have trust. You got to have trust with the, with the subordinate leadership that you're working with, whether that's you working with your whole platoon and you just got to trust your, your squad leaders and your, your fire team leaders. But you got to build that trust through,

Speaker 3:          00:30:17       through training and through Harvard Training,

Speaker 1:          00:30:21       through coaching them and mentoring it. And again, I hate using the word coaching and mentoring because that always gives an air of superiority and I'm not going to want to come off across as superior to other people. Mm hmm. Why do I not want to come off as superior to other people? Well, number one, because it, it unifies our team more. And number two, cause I'm not superior to other people, right? Um, another person and my subordinates, even though they might not have as much time in rank or experiences me, they still might have great ideas and I respect that. So this isn't a, hey, I don't want to use coach or mentor because I'm manipulating them and I want to make sure that they, that they listened to me because I'm being a certain way with them. No, no. I legitimately respect what they're saying.

Speaker 1:          00:31:05       That's the difference here. So, but that's my goal is to build trust. And the other way that you build trust enough said this before, is by giving trust. You know, hey, I trust that you can do this. Hey Echo, you're going to go take down a building. I trust your plan. Come up with it, make it happen. Boom, you could do it. You trust me more when I trust you, you trust me. And that's what we want to do now when the operation is over and now you're in a post operational debrief thing, you can discuss why you gave a certain order or you can get feedback from them on why they executed in a certain way. And you can get the questions going back and forth and through that little question and answer period that takes place during a post operational debrief. We get to know each other more, we build more trust and we become better as a team.

Speaker 3:          00:31:50       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:31:52       So that's the way it works. You don't always have time to explain why pressure situations you lead.

Speaker 3:          00:31:59       Yeah. Yeah. That trust thing is big indeed. Next question. Next question. I like it. What do we got?

Speaker 1:          00:32:13       What advice do you have for those who have weak, poor, or otherwise ineffective leaders? How do you manipulate that situation? So again, I think I may have actually answered this question before

Speaker 3:          00:32:28       [inaudible], but I'll answer it again. Sure. When,

Speaker 1:          00:32:37       when you are in a situation this, when you got somebody that's weak or ineffective leader or a poor leader, the answer's always the same. Which news you lead, you lead yourself and I hope people that listen to podcast, all of the regular, you all knew what I was going to say there. You all know that when someone is not leading you, then you lead them. You pick up the slack for the weakness. My leader want to come up with a plan. Cool. I will. My leader doesn't want to give a brief. That's fine. I will. My leader doesn't want to mentor the younger troops. That's okay. I will do it. Leader doesn't want to take the blame when something goes wrong. That's fine with me. I'm going to take the blame and you think about that one. That one can be tricky because you think, well, I'm going to look bad in front of the, in front of the more senior boss.

Speaker 1:          00:33:34       Now think about it from the senior bosses position. If if you work for me echo and the boss comes in and we the, the mission was a failure and I'm the, and I'm the guy that's in charge and I say, sorry boss, we failed. It was echo's fault and echo goes, hey sir, it was my fault. Here's what happened, here's the mistakes I made and here's what we do to fix it next time. Who Do you respect more? Yeah, of course. I'm looking at promoting you. I actually want to promote you and our fire myself for being a guy that's passing the buck and passing responsibility, not taking ownership of anything. So imagine what that looks like before you get all intimidated by taking the blame for something and think you're going to look bad and think you're going to get fired. Think about what it looks like from the senior perspective.

Speaker 1:          00:34:14       And you actually have to imagine what it looked like underneath you. You have to see it from your perspective cause it's even when you think about their perspective, you still can be in fear of it. You Think, oh I'm the guy that's taking the blame. I'm the one that's going to get fired. No. And am I saying this like blanket that there's sometimes where if if the boss screw something up really bad, like let's say it was something like classified information got left out and it was your boss that literally left it out and you go, no, it was me. Well first of all, you're not telling the truth. Right? So you're not telling the truth and the person made a mistake. That's that. There's no excuse for, yeah. So that's not a situation that I'm talking about. And if your boss was the type of person that said, yes, I'm going to put the blame on him, I would burn them alive.

Speaker 1:          00:35:01       But I'd be like, actually, here's what really happened. So I'm not talking about that type of situation. But when you're doing an operational thing where there's mistakes that get made and your boss is scared to take ownership of them, take ownership of them, not that you will win in the long run. Um, now, now here's the part that is crucial and critical and the most challenging part of this. And that is when you step up and lead, you want to make sure you weren't stepping up and stepping on your leader. You don't want to step into their little spotlight. You don't want to impose yourself in their leadership limelight. And Gloria, you don't want to do that. You, you, you can't do that. You want them to get the credit. You don't want to have them be intimidated by you in any way. And this is hard because when you start taking ownership for stuff, it's very, it can be very, um, intimidating for the person that's above you because they think, Dang, this guy just, he's just a bold bastard than stepping up and taking charge of stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:36:15       And they might get intimidated that. So, so what'd you have to do is you have to do some, some indirect maneuver warfare here. And for instance, if they don't want to, if they don't want to come up with a plan, maybe you start saying, hey sir, what do you think of this? Would this be a good plan? And maybe if you're, if they're not mentoring the younger guys, maybe say, Hey, you know what? I want to do this up. I want to spend some time with the guys after work. Do you mind if I have a little session with them? Kind of go over what we've learned on last appointment? Or Hey, about this new regulatory thing that's come out in the business world and I want to get our younger troops to know it. Do you mind if I teach a class on that?

Speaker 1:          00:36:52       So you're, you're asking them permission and you might even say, you know, hey, I think it would look really good for you too if we were doing this. Do you want to make them look good? Um, and those are the ways that you do that. You step up and lead, but make sure you're not stepping on your leader because that, that, that could backfire. And you could end up in a situation where they feel intimidated and you're getting put in the dog house or fired or demoted or in trouble because they feel intimidated by you. So use caution if you have a good leader. Some leaders just aren't that aggressive and when you start getting aggressive, they start, they actually like the fact that you're getting aggressive and they like, I mean, I worked for some people that I love the fact that I would take a step up and take charge.

Speaker 1:          00:37:41       They had no problem with it because they were good, confident leaders. It's the insecure leader you have to watch out for the insecure leader that's worried about looking bad. And that's another two to change perspective. Again on this, when you as a leader have somebody that's stepping up and taking charge, as you start feeling intimidated by it, ask yourself why. It's probably your ego. You're being a weak leader by being intimidated by your subordinates. If you're subordinate is doing your job at doing it better than you let get step up and start looking at how can you go up the chain of command? How can you look up and out? How, what other areas can you focus on? Since that leader has stepped up and is making things happen, that's awesome. That is awesome. We want that. That's decentralized command. That's building other leaders underneath you, which is what your goal is. A leader should always be,

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       and I'll tell ya, every time I see someone that goes, oh, I got a weak leader. I'm always like, lucky you. Lucky you. Take advantage of that. Take advantage of it. Do whatever you want. Do you have such not good opportunity when you have a weak leader above, you? Don't look at that. Don't, don't get all down trodden because they're going to or just doesn't motivate you. Awesome. Motivate yourself, get char, get in charge of things, take advantage of it. Make things happen. It's awesome to have a weak leader. I love it. Get after it. It's good to give me so much mobility in my, in my, in my job. Right. I'm so much more mobility. Then if I've got someone, Hey, if I've got someone that's as strong leader, that's great too, but weak leaders know factor, I'm going to take advantage of it.

Speaker 4:          00:39:20       Yeah. I feel like, yes, you got a weak leader and you're kind of, you're not stepping up. You're essentially allowing that the group, the team, the objectives to kind of fail in a way. You're kind of allowing it and then in a way to, depends on what you do, but in a way you're kind of being like, hey, all right. You're allowing the excuse to be valid. You know where, which kind of makes it invalid really, when you're like, Hey, I could step up, but hey, it's the leaders for as long as it's not my fault. You know that my leader is not that good. You know? It's, you're really not taking much ownership. Yeah. You just point your finger at your leader and say, this is a weak leader. That's not what we do here. Not what we do at all. And the end of the Times where I've had weak leaders, I always took advantage of it.

Speaker 4:          00:40:13       Like I said one time, and I've talked about this on the podcast before we fired our leader. No, we had a little mutiny that only happened once for me. But it happens that, I mean I obviously, I don't know all the details of that, but in a way isn't that you just stepping up and making it happen. I mean that's really the basic impending result. Like Dang, that's, that's kind of where we're going to arrive. That really given us stepping up. If, if that's how it goes down. That's how it goes down. But you stepped up, you solve the problem, they're the problem then that was a problem. There's your solution. Yes. Up and down the chain of command. You got to own it. Yeah, for sure. Alright. Jocko Exhibition Jocko. Hmm. Did you do anything ritualistically to get yourself mentally prepared? Focused and in the proper mindset? So just before carrying out a mission such as self talk music or other actions, you know, get yourself revved up pre operation preparedness for the mental state. So people ask this and it's, and it actually sounds like a pretty cool question, right? I mean it sounds like a pretty cool question. I'm sure people walk through that. Um, it's a lot of times because you

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       think seals and soldiers and marines must have some kind of deep and incredibly meaningful borderline religious ceremony that they go to and through in order to prepare their mind. Ver Combat. Maybe it's a, maybe it's a meditation on the warrior code or maybe it's an aggressive song to peak your adrenaline. Maybe it's a, a breathing exercise. We got a special breathing exercise that's going to heighten my mental awareness and there's even seals and I use that term loosely that have written books on that subject of, you know, this, this warrior mindset and the navy seal breathing techniques and the, the visualization and things like that. No, I hate to spoil the romantic vision of the mindful warrior poet, but that actually,

Speaker 1:          00:42:48       that idea just, it does not what happens and here's the reality. Um, first and foremost, when you are in combat and you're preparing for an operation, you are freaking busy. You are busy. You are planning, you're doing coordination, you're doing gear prep, you're doing briefings, you're making all these adjustments and changes to everything that's happening. You don't eat. We are scrambling around. I was talking to laugh the other day and there was a, most of the time if we were going on, on in the field on an operation, we wouldn't be sleeping for 24 hours before we went in the field. You know, maybe we'd get two or three hours, but it was a sleep deprivation before we went in the field because of all the planning and preparation that needed to be done, especially on the big operations with battalion sized or, or brigade sized operations.

Speaker 1:          00:43:39       There's so much planning and preparation that needs to be done that you don't have. You're not just, you're not just sitting around figuring out what kind of mental prep you're going to do. There's just last minute detail. There's a phone call, you got a place to higher headquarters. There's a, uh, a Deacon Fishkin document that you got to prepare. You've got to, you got to get stuff done. So taking some, some kind of meditative moments to get in the right mindset. It's just not happening. You just don't have the time for it. Now that being said, mindset, it is a part of combat, right? And so how did I get in the right mission mindset? Well, the mindset is not achieved in the minutes or even hours before an operation from, you know, chanting a mantra or breathing or meditation or listening to some song that's going to get you in touch with your warrior spirit.

Speaker 1:          00:44:42       The mindset is achieved in the the weeks and the months and the years before that specific operation commends us. That's another thing that the, the idea from that actually I was raised on in the 90s in the seal teams was like, you are going to do a mission. We used to joke about it called the big Mish, right? The big mission was going to come and was going to be one mission, right? And you could get, Hey, we're going to plan for it. We're going to plan for it for weeks, maybe even months, and we're going to be able to visualize everything. And we'd have all this time, but reality is overseas. You don't. Since the war started, man, you're doing an operation every night. You're going out, you've got another week. Come back. You're planning for that one. When that one gets canceled for whatever reason, there's two more that you're playing in four and you're running out to grab intelligence, your meet with somebody else.

Speaker 1:          00:45:29       It's just constantly ongoing, so we weren't ever preparing for one mission. We were planning, we were preparing for mission after mission. We'd have five, six, seven, 10 we'd have 10 operations in the hopper at any given time that we're planning and preparing for. We're gathering intelligence for, we're setting up, we're doing route studies for four or five different operations at one time. Then finally one rise to the occasion. Boom. We're going to go hit that one the next night, and another one's up to the top. We're going to go hit that one. Okay, so again, this idea that I think came from the nineties of, Hey, we're going to do the big mish. Yeah, we're going to have to get into mental mindset. No, we lived in a mental mindset, but that mindset came from the training that we went through. The grueling training through the repetition of the fundamental skill sets. The mindset comes from the discipline, from waking up early, from studying tactics, from understanding the enemy, from all those,

Speaker 5:          00:46:28       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:46:28       Unmitigated daily disciplines. That's where the mindset comes with it comes from, and I'll tell you on top of that, on top of that, you have to come to grip with some pretty horrific potential outcomes, right. You have to accept some solemn possibilities like that you might be severely wounded or that you might be killed. And you also have to think that about the guys. You're your friends. That is a nother possibility that you have to think about. But for yourself, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:47:14       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:47:14       you have to accept that possibility. You have to accept that potential outcome that you could die and you have to accept that now you don't want it.

Speaker 5:          00:47:26       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:47:27       of course you want to live, but you have to accept the fact

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       that in the game, the game of combat, you could very well die.

Speaker 3:          00:47:39       And I do that

Speaker 4:          00:47:42       and I was okay with it. But, but I had come to that conclusion a long time before whatever operation I was getting to roll out on one particular night during a six month long deployment.

Speaker 3:          00:47:55       Hmm.

Speaker 4:          00:47:56       So the mindset is built over time and like knowledge that you have the mindset, it becomes so ingrained that knowledge becomes so ingrained that you don't have to cram for it. Like you'd cram for a final exam. You don't have to cram for the test to combat in the last minute. You already know you already have the confidence, you know you've done everything possible to prepare mentally to prepare physically to prepare emotionally.

Speaker 3:          00:48:28       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:48:29       And then when the call comes and you put on your cammies and you fill up your canteens and you put on your helmet and you lock down your night vision, you lock and load your weapon to roll out the gate.

Speaker 3:          00:48:45       You're ready.

Speaker 4:          00:48:50       You ever seen the movie gone in 60 seconds, smell living? No movies that you've seen written on a stature. There's a part where there a button there, their car jackers team of car thieves. They got to do this mission to save the brother. You know, they're all retired. That's why I said, but they got to do this one last mission. So it'd be big Mesh. The big miss you have. Exactly. So they go through with it and get into a mindset. So check it out. Imagine if in the movie they were doing that mission every single night. I'm not going through that drill every night because they know they prepared, they know they've got their mind right and they're gonna go out and execute the operation. That's the difference. Or maybe they would do it every night. This is what they do. All right, let's hear it. Paint, put it on low rider. You know the song.

Speaker 3:          00:49:34       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:49:35       [inaudible] then they just kind of listened to it and then they go super subtle. Yeah. Maybe check it out. Yeah. You know, some guys, you know, crank up a song. You know, we had speaker, we actually had speakers outside. Sometimes the guys would be blasting some music, but it wasn't old, like a ritualistic thing where we all sat there, closed her eyes and listen to the same song at the same time meet. Yeah. Yeah. Well yeah, I mean, and you know what, I was always either what my two combat deployments, I was a platoon commander, I was task in your commander so, well I was busy. You know, I was, all that planning stuff that I'm talking about was, was me. If I was going out, if I wasn't going out then I wasn't doing anything ritualistically to get ready to go out. Um, but you're busy.

Speaker 4:          00:50:18       People don't understand how busy you are in combat, not just while you're on the battlefield, but when you're back in the rear, uh, preparing to go or preparing or planning for operations. Yeah, I would imagine some people, you know, cause even list them all. I mean really how deep, how far do you want to stretch the word? Like ritual, right. So that I'm sure some people would write maybe like, like I said, kid, like a lucky thing or I don't know if you keep the carried lots. Now you're getting a different realm here. You're talking about superstition. Well you're also talking about, so I had certain patterns that I followed, right? Yeah. Those patterns were not for my mental state. They were to be prepared. Right. But it's kind of, you know, I've talked about how I had to caught filled with my gear and when I put all that gear on I was ready.

Speaker 4:          00:50:58       Right. That's, that's, that's, and I put the gear on the same way every time because you're going through a process and a procedure so that you make sure you get everything right. Even when I'm coming to the record, the podcast, I do the same thing every time I get this ready, I get that ready to print this stuff out. I, you know, I bring the same pens, the same stupid pens. I bring them all the time cause I have a pattern that I go through set. I'm ready for what we're going to do. That's a standard operating procedure to be ready for the operation. Whether it gets me to mental state. Yeah, I guess it does. Good Mental Stan. Technically that is a ritual then I guess on Boston. No, no, no, no. You're the man of course. For sure. Up Busted. But no, I think I am in Boston because that is definitely a ritualistic thing to go through.

Speaker 4:          00:51:40       And if I talk about, uh, being in combat, sure. Where you're getting your gear on, you're [inaudible], you know, you're, you're programming your radio, you're getting radio check theirs. But again, the reason it doesn't really hit me as a ritualistic thing because those are, those are standard procedures that you're going to prepare for the mission. You're not there physical things that have to be done. They're not for mental preparation. Now does your mind no. What's coming? Yes. And I'll tell you a classic example is when you put down your night vision, which for those of you who don't understand this, we have a helmet on and you have night vision on it. It can flip up where you're just looking for your regular eyes. But then when you black out the vehicles and your flip your night vision down, you're in a different world. You're in a green world of darkness where you know what's about to, you're about to do.

Speaker 4:          00:52:26       So whenever I flip my night vision down, he would always give me a a sensation. Again, it wasn't this is preparing me. I knew that it was time. Right. There's a difference. There's a subtle difference. No difference, no there. I'm sure there is a different, but there's some, there's overlap there. Where I think that is, I mean, like I said, it depends how loose you want to use the word ritual, but technically yet, like remember you said one time, he said something about before you guys rolled out. Everyone starts there in the same time ritual and ritual, however, standard operating procedures, it's a functional thing. Like you've got to put your night vision goggles down. You have to do that. You, it's what you're going to do and when you do that, because you've done it a hundred times before, you know that that's now game on. But if, if you're just putting your night vision goggles done, that's not really the ritual. But if it's like, I'm going to put my night vision goggles down after I do this every single time, that's a ritual. Or we all do it together. Like when it's, you're calling

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       it a ritual, you're putting a, you're putting a ritualistic flavor to it. It's a standard operating procedure. They can be processed. But I'm saying it's not ritualistic because there was no, um, embedded deeper meaning that was put on top of it purposely. Very ceremonial. We're trying to make it, we're trying to make it in someone's not right. Right. Do you follow the same standard operating procedures? Yes. So you and, and you know, when we talk about fighters, you know, I've been with a lot of fighters and, and coached him and those guys have little ritualistic things to get. Sometimes it is music, right? Because they're going to go fight a five minute round and they're going to listen to something or they're going to, they're going to sit there and close their eyes and think about what's important to them. That's fine. I'm telling you, when I was overseas, I didn't have time to do any of that.

Speaker 1:          00:54:14       We were running around. Never once did I say standby, Hey, no one talked to me for the next three minutes while I get in the zone. Yeah, no, I was in the zone because I spent my, you know, did a workup, did spent my time in the teams, went through training, you know, shot my gun, knew, knew what I was doing and so I didn't need to get in the zone. And I think that's what I think. That's why I think I'm sensitive to this. And here's why I think I'm sensitive to this. I think I'm sensitive to this because I think people try and, and tell, tell people or sell people on the fact that if you do these things, it will prepare you mentally for, you know, a pressure situation. And that's what bothers me about it. That's what bothers me about it is, hey, if you do this, if you, this is what it is.

Speaker 1:          00:55:02       If you take this shortcut, then you will be prepared. Because I would never tell someone, oh, you want to fight an MMA fight? You're going to get in the cage. Cool. Here's what you need to do to train for that three minutes before you enter the cage, go into his room, shut your eyes and think about how you're going to win the fight. That is not true. Now this is, I guess this is where you've just, you've just gotten this out of me. Echo you took me to, to, to my point that I, that I believe in, right? That is not what prepares you for the fight. What prepares you for the fight is the years and years of training that you've done to get there. The last three minutes. You can have a ritual and it can put your mind in the right place, but that's not what's putting your riding in the right place.

Speaker 1:          00:55:47       And what's putting your mind in the right place is the months and months and years of training. Same thing with on the battlefield. If someone said, hey, I'm about to go execute a, uh, a direct action mission and what should I do to prepare for that? I wouldn't say, well, what you need to do is listen to your favorite an odor head song. No, that is not going to help you. What you need to do is you need to do this, you need to go this shooting. You need to work on these types of tactics. You need to understand what to do when someone gets wounded. You need to have standard operating procedures for how to go into an out of buildings. You need to understand how to clear rooms with open doors, closed doors, corner fed rooms, all of these different things that you need to know. You know, I would tell you all of that stuff, but what I don't like is when someone says, oh, what you need to do to be ready is do these, do this last fraction of a thing, and that's what's going to prepare you for combat.

Speaker 1:          00:56:35       No, not true. Yeah. What prepares you for combat? What prepares you for a fight? What prepares you for a tough business decision? What prepares you for a pressure scenario that you're going into isn't the three minutes before? That's the icing on the cake. So I don't want to focus on that. I want to focus on the daily disciplines for months and weeks and years. That led you up to the point so that when I went in combat for the first time and, and, and shot my gun for the first time, it wasn't about the song that I listened to. It wasn't about the briefing that I did. It was the discipline and the training that got me there. So maybe I was a little bit hard coming out of the gate on this idea, but that's what, that's why it was hard and I didn't really understand that in my own mind until you started bleeding me down this road because that stuff does, when I see somebody trying to sell that, I don't like that.

Speaker 1:          00:57:25       Yeah, I don't like that. Do I have rituals? Yes. I absolutely do not even have rituals for when I get up in the morning and what I do. You know, I, I fill my water bottle, my water bottle every night when I go to bed and he's in the same spot when I get up out of bed in the morning, my water bottles there, I put my, you know, I, I'd go very quietly in the bathroom and we talk about this. I do what I gotta do in there. I come out, I grabbed it's dark, I grabbed my water bottle. It's already where I know it's gonna be. I need you to turn on any lights. It's where it's supposed to be. That's a ritual. I go to the kitchen, it's dark in the kitchen. I fill up the water bottle by sound cause you know how this little beautiful sound as it fills up, it gets higher and higher and higher and then boom, you kill it.

Speaker 1:          00:57:59       Now I walk out, I flip on a light in the back of the house, put the shoes on because I'm not bothering anyone. So there's a little ritual there. When I walk up to the gym, plugging the music and now it's time to get after it. So there's a ritual there. There's, there's, even when I go to the gym and do Jujitsu, I have a little ritual that I follow. There I go, man. I taped the fingers. I do what I gotta do for those youth people that are going to ask. I taped the, the, the two fingers on my right hand, my pinky and my, and my ring finger on my right hand because my pinkies has got a little judo finger. Right. So I, I taped those two together. It also gives me a little bit of that friction on the guillotine. At least that's what I've told Echo to further intimidate and scare him of the GT.

Speaker 1:          00:58:41       So there's some little ritualistic things there. If Dean's there, when I'll go in the sauna for five minutes and just get a little bit warm before he, and he sees me sweating. He doesn't like to see me sweating cause he knows that, that I'm, it's on, it's on, right. So I'll go in there just to send a little mental vibe to Dean that you know what Jack was already sweating. He says, Damn. So those ritualistic things, those are the fraction, the tiniest part of what you need to do to prepare the preparation. The mindset doesn't come from those things. You want to, you want to close out that final bit and make it something ritualistic that gets you in the right mindset. Do it. But that not where the money

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       is made, the money is made in the, everything that leads up to those final three minutes or two minutes or five minutes of ritualistic behavior that you have to get you ready to rock and roll. So bring it. What can we extrapolate there? So the question is no really, I mean you maintained really cause the question is do you do anything ritualistically to get yourself mentally prepared? Focus and proper mindsets. So you don't, but you do do things that are rituals. But that's not the question. This is one of the question. So you're the rituals you're talking about in regards to, Oh yeah, Richard is, do I have, what rituals did I have in, in, in, in preparing for combat, training my ass off, being prepared, studying the enemy, being in crop, physical condition, those, the rituals, the rituals are the training and the rituals that, like I said, for the 20th time, that little tiny thing, those are just standard operating procedures.

Speaker 4:          01:00:17       And when you do those ritualistically, then you're then you number one, you won't forget anything. You'll know that you have all your gear, you'll know that you've done what you're supposed to do and when you put your night vision goggles down, you'll know that it's on the straight and you'll be, men are mentally prepared. So your standard operating procedures are rituals by technicality. Sure, sure. There you though, if for those of you that aren't watching this on youtube, echo just looked extremely proud of the, of the statement right there. I wasn't malady. They are, I'm proud. I'm proud that I had some influence. I don't want to completely beat a dead horse. Um, because, but, but what bothers me about that idea is people thinking they can cut corners on the preparation. You can't cut corners. That's my point. You can't cut corners and think you're going to get the three minute preparation to be ready for combat, to be ready for battle for, you'll be ready for a pressure situation to be ready for a tough business decision. You don't get ready for that in three minutes. You get ready for that for months and years. That's how you prepare for it, bro. I was, I used to play football at Uah and we had this, I don't know if you're watching like football Bragg. No, I'm not. No, I'm not laying down the set. We already knew that though.

Speaker 4:          01:01:42       Anyway, so I was a wide receiver and for the drill wide receiver I was a lot smaller back then. I was like one 81 85, whatever. Nonetheless, one of the drills was this, um, if you know football camp, you'll know this. It's like it's a motor on a big tripod and on the motor or the spinning tires and they spin this way is too, there's three of them. So this they go on this weird skewed angle. So basically you load a football from the back and you push it through and it shoots the ball like, yeah. And there's different speeds and stuff like that. So uh, my coach, what was his name, put you miles

Speaker 2:          01:02:21       my, I forget if that was his first name or last name. Anyway, coach miles, he wasn't very nice coach so he would like drill us with it. Right. Which is fine. That part is cool cause it's training. But the, the part that I didn't think was very cool was if you missed like there was, you would pay a price. Like he would yell at you, he'd sometimes he'd make you run it. Like if you missed, it wasn't like it was like, to me the punishment, it was wrong. Like the system was wrong, their punishment didn't fit the crime well. Yeah. It wasn't like this isn't going to make you better to put more pressure on this drill. You know, it was more like, Hey, look, eh, but he wants to cause stress. Okay. Okay, good, good. I didn't feel that at the time. And now, I mean, I'd have to think about it more.

Speaker 2:          01:03:03       I haven't thought about it and write your essays. Your viewpoint would be different maybe, but maybe not though. No, no, I don't think so. Only because I think that you're trying to get the best out of these people. You know, for a specific game day, there's been a lot of pressure and you can actually get used to that stress by inoculating yourself to it by him saying, look, you've got to catch this ball or you're going to pay the man. Yeah. Or just get better at catching so you can know. So you could focus on getting better at taking stress or get getting better at catching. Okay. We'll give you focusing now what I would say is that he should have combined both of them and he should have given you guys ample time to just practice the coaching part and then later distress. That would've been great if he did that.

Speaker 2:          01:03:42       In fact is he did nuts. So back to the ritual, mental preparation, whatever. So thou, it would be stressful for me as a young, I was like 17 when I started footballs, you know, late anyway. So I'm like one of the young guys and heat. And so when he do stuff like to make it harder and harder and harder. So of course you're gonna Miss. So there's this one where he's like ball and then you know you're supposed to turn it on the balls on its way, full speed. Things like in thing comes real hard anyway. So you'd miss and then he'd get on that. So anyway, I'm stressed now. It was not every practice I'm going to and stress about that one drill that we're going to do. So before practice we had this cool, real, real nice facility. There's this lounge where I want to just kind of cruise and mellow out cause he goes, you know, from class to pre-practice prep and then some meetings.

Speaker 2:          01:04:30       And then practice is a little bit of downtime where you can mellow out in the lunch. So in the lounge, I'd close my eyes a lot of the time and be like, just visualize that ball only for the drill. Not In scrimmage time screaming. I have no problem, but I'm visual, I'm mentally preparing for the drill. It just doesn't seem right anyway. So yeah, mentally, mentally visualizing the ball coming at crazy speeds and I'm catching him, pull him, catch him off my in my little visualization. So I go and as time went on, I kept doing that over and over and over. Didn't help to drill at all. Full failed. Like as far as any kind of effect, I would catch some miss, some get yelled at, more stress next to him, even worse. Same thing. So I, I would say this, first

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       of all, visualization of uh, a physical technique is proven to help. So it didn't help. In your case, what I would have said would have been the most helpful for you is to say, you know what? I don't care what this guy does to me. Yeah. I don't care if I miss this ball. Mama, go out there and have fun. Yeah. You want me to do? It's not going to act like a maniac. I'm going to have such a good time running down the field. I know what he calls ball. I'm going to turn around and do my best to grab that thing. If I don't grab it, I'm going to do 14 somersaults and I'm going to have a good time and so that would you, you're taking the pressure off yourself because that's probably what was what was a GM and you up this you'd like to say it. I don't say this to back to this whole idea, right? Another thing that that I, that I feel this sort of allergy to this type of thing is it's sort of like a, on the Tim Ferris

Speaker 1:          01:06:08       episode where I was just answering questions, I'm going to ask about motivation and I said like, look, motivation isn't, isn't your friend, right? Motivations going to go up and down. I feel like you know what's going to be good is discipline, discipline. And so there's really, that's the difference between what I'm talking about here when we're talking about, hey, what do you do to get into mindset? Well that's really talking about, you know, your mental mindset of motivation. No, but what I'm talking about is discipline, standard operating procedures that actually prepare you for what you're about to do. Not that motivate you temporarily by listening to a good song or by doing some breathing drill that gets you mentally. But no, the discipline is what's going to make you mentally prepared for what's about to happen. So again, that's why I think I'm, I'm a little bit stuck in a mud on this one and I'm trying to have an open mind, but I think those are the key components for me.

Speaker 1:          01:06:59       I don't like when people try and sell shortcuts on stuff and make it, you know, hey, you'll be great if you do these three minutes. No, actually you won't. You need to do everything else. You need to do the hard work. Yeah. And people buy into that. Why did they buy into that? Because they want to take, everyone wants the quick and easy, you know, I mean people that listen to this podcast don't. Yeah. Right. And the people that are here, we want to get in the game fully. Two hours. Two hours in a book. Yes. Yeah. No shortcuts. No shortcuts. So I think that's the difference is people, some people sell that and there's too many people that buy into it when what they should be buying is hey hard work and dedication and discipline is what's going to mentally prepare me. Not this other stuff. Yeah. At the end. Yeah. So yeah. So really like I said, the sop bite by technicality, it's a ritual. But here's the thing about it being only technically or ritual because if you take that away,

Speaker 5:          01:07:55       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:55       Not necessarily the SLP cause that has a full on function. You know what to, I hate to cut you off just to talk about what we just, what we're talking about here. Right. Cause cause I said hey with the podcast and I've said this before, we have a ritual that I do. I, you do it too. When I come, I brew the tea, I'm gonna put my hat, my pens, and I do the folder, I print the stuff out. I have, I put, put the knives in the bag. I have a ritual that I go through, but to case in point, case in point, that is not what prepares me for the episode. That is not what prepares me for the recording. What prepares me for the recording is what w is spending 10 hours, 12 hours, 15 hours diving into a book, looking up words. I don't know, doing background studies on battles that I don't understand that are mentioned offhand, researching some general that gets mentioned. That's what prepares me. That's what gets me in the mindset to record a podcast, not the ritual. The ritual doesn't actually mean anything without that core deep preparation that's done. And that kind of settles our point here. Yeah, I by no mean very nicely.

Speaker 2:          01:08:58       Yeah, I was going straight technical. And you, I think you're absolutely correct. And sometimes because I would fall like, especially when you're young and you're like, just anything that'll help me, you know, like do I, did I tie my shoes in the wrong, you know, like superstition goes in there. You don't, you know, that feeling where you're like, Dang, you just stressed about something. So anything that'll help. And then after a while you kind of go to yourself, man, it doesn't matter what order I put my shoes on right now. It doesn't matter what color my socks are, you know, you know, man, I used to have this thing where I'd be stressed to go to school for whatever it is. Like intermediate skin. When you're like a news glue, it's just a little bit stressed, not full on, but still is looking for a little thing.

Speaker 2:          01:09:36       So it's this weird even thinking about her in a so weird. Um, so I'd have a, you know, music in your car on a tape. So I liked Bushwick bill, who's a rapper and Geto boys. Anyway. No. So, and it had, you know, punch of swearing in it, but it was just a great, great album. And I liked it, but I had it. We strangely in my mind, if I listen to like negative stuff, I'd have a negative day and some people might say like, well who that's going to true. But no, I don't think so. I think it doesn't matter really what music you like. Maybe my certain music might put you in a certain mood, but that's up to you.

Speaker 1:          01:10:15       Yeah, we're actually going in a whole nother direction or which I'm fine with going there. Um, I have always found that music to me, like the words and the music. I'm barely registering what they are. I know him. I'll be, it might even be singing along with them in my mind, but, but the words generally aren't having a huge impact. I mean I've listened to all kinds of rock and roll music throughout my years. If I would've followed, followed along with 10% of the lyrics, I would probably be a heroin addict in the gutter somewhere. Right. Cause you can't just listen to music and obey. What they say. In fact, you shouldn't do that. Most music is a lot of music is negative, right? I mean a lot of music is very negative in what it's saying. So yeah. So what you're saying is the ritual of listening to the right music is an important or not?

Speaker 2:          01:11:06       No, not important at all. I'm just saying I used to like kind of, I don't know if they fall for that trick, but I young, I was like an intermediate

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       school. So you believed it. You believed at the time. If you listen to negative music you might have a negative negative day. Yes. And not the fame, not the kind of where it's like I'm going to listen to this and then I choose to go. This will fire me up to do what I, it wasn't that it was a superstition is what it was. And I'm saying my point for the whole thing is you don't like how people like basically hang their success or failure on some Ma visualization or some ritual and agree. Then that the point I'm making is I would have to like remind myself of that. Like men, the music, like nothing bad's going to happen to me because I listened to Bushwick Bill. Talk about this thing that I will say this though. That is a conscious decision that you made. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:11:53       Whereas if you were just listening, I mean music changes your mood. Music changes my mood for sure. Yeah. And when I hear certain music I get a certain reaction to it and I will get into a certain emotional state before I'm listening to a song that's about something or not something else, you know, that will have an effect on me now. I don't know that. My point is that eat the lyrics themselves don't really mean anything I guess. I guess if they do mean something though, and they hit me a certain way, music definitely will put you in a different mood in my opinion. Yeah. If you let it, like if you're using it well I would say put you in a mood unless you don't, don't let it. Yeah. Cause if you just listen to it now, there's times where you listen to whatever music and it's just not going to hit you.

Speaker 4:          01:12:37       But some music that you have might have a core, uh, fought about. Now does this go back and negate my earlier point? That music doesn't affect my mindset? Does that do it? Am I right now I'm going back on what I said, cause I said, oh, music doesn't affect your mindset. Uh, I guess I am going to though. Yeah. But ultimately I think, I think really it holds up where you look, here's the deal, here's the deal. You're going into a stressful combat situation and you didn't get a chance to listen to your song. Can you afford to be like, oh no, I can't go. No. So that's why, that's another reason why yes, I'm staying with my original point. Yeah, I agree. I agree with you. Let's stick with it. Don't let anyone sway you. Don't let them, it's still a real bite technicality though.

Speaker 4:          01:13:22       Jocko. Is this question number five now or can you speak about winging it and when it's best to just go for it and when making a plan without the time to do still is the best course. Okay. Yeah, I can definitely talk about that. Um, well winging it is never the first choice. And when, when you see people in the, in the seal teams are in the military, if they're winging something, it's something that they've practiced a lot. If it's something that they have planned Broglie before and they've so much experience in that, whatever that type of operation that they can actually get away with it. Right? And a good example, if you take a Jiu Jitsu example like dean lister, he

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       can wing it in a match. Jeff Glover can do that to a ridiculous level of just winging it in competition and just show up and just do what he does because he's got, you know, those guys at that high level have a mental fluidity that's going to be very helpful for them. Now there's other people that are very high level Jujitsu players that don't wing it, that are very much more methodical. And I'm sure there's some cases with both Jeff and dean where they probably should have been more methodical. But I mean Jeff has straight up suicidal in many of his matches. I mean, and that's what's beautiful is, is that he moves so much so rapidly that people can't hang with him on that level in most cases. Um, so that's why he, he, he is winging it. Like every movement that he makes is winging it.

Speaker 1:          01:15:01       But case in point, he's puts himself in those situations all the time. You come to the gym and watch them train. He's letting people put him in the worst possible situations and figuring a way out of it. So the reason he can wing it in the competitions, cause he's, he's, he's put putting practice and discipline, they're in the background and if you saw my seal platoon or tasking it, we could wing it on operations all the time because we were prepared because we knew each other so well because we had standard operating procedures that covered so much of the things that would happen during an operation where we would be quote unquote winging it. So even though we're winging it, we're not really winging it because we have all these standard standard operating procedures in place that we didn't really need to plan. But if you have time to plan and of course plan, do as much planning as you can, dig in and plan every detail that you can plan.

Speaker 1:          01:16:01       Now when it does come to planning, I think the most important part of a plan, the thing that makes a plan the most effective is its flexibility and making a plan that is so flexible that when you do the actual operation and you come up against unexpected things which are absolutely going to happen, you have the flexibility, you have options, you have contingency plans to deal with now so plan as much as you can. But the problem is with all that emphasis on planning and sometimes people become obsessed with planning and they plan and they plan and they plan some more and they plan and they plan and plan and they don't want to execute and if they do execute, they execute late. They missed their opportunity. So that's why, that's why Patton said, I got this note written down here. Patents at a good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week.

Speaker 1:          01:17:05       Right. That's what we're talking about. He's come up with a good plan. Don't come up with the perfect plan that takes you two weeks to come up with. That's not going to help you. That's something you need to keep in the front of your mind and that is especially applicable in a tactical decision that's being made in the field, right? Something that is unfolding. You see the enemy maneuvering. You come up with a quick plan and you execute because every minute that you're waiting to execute, the enemy is maneuvering on you that that low in enemy fire. That's not them retreating and running away. No. Your mindset has to be that. That's them maneuvering on you. They're getting a better position. They're setting up, getting ready to crush you, so don't let that happen.

Speaker 1:          01:17:52       Make a plan and go in. That comes back again to flexibility. If you come up with a good plan and you go, as that plan is being executed, you got to pay attention. You've got to pay attention and watch how it's unfolding it don't put the blinders on and you've got your plan and now we're going to go on. We're not going to look around anymore. We're just gonna follow the plan. No, you have to be observant. You have to observe, Orient, decide, and act the whole time. You can't just come up with a plan and stay on that track because when you come up with a fast plan, you're not going to have thought about every single detail and you don't know what the enemy's going to do anyways. You don't know what your competitor is going to do. You can't guarantee that. So when you see them start to react to your, what you executed, now you've got to be ready to react yourself and get the art, the the upper hand and take the offensive.

Speaker 1:          01:18:42       So there's an, there's one more. There's one more little dichotomy to this, and I'll just say it, even though I'm saying you got to adapt your plan and you need to adjust as things happen, you also want to stick to your point. Those things are completely the opposite of each other, right? I'm saying adapt and change your plan as needed, but I'm also telling you to stick to your plan. But for instance, if you rehearsed a, or if you have a standard operating procedure for your order of patrol. So this is the, the order of, you know, the point man, and it's, it's Jones and then Smith and then Washington and then Jefferson, and that's your border patrol, right? And those guys were always marching in that order. And so we know each other, we know how to work together, we have fire team integrity, we have a standard operating procedure, and we're going to attack a target. And when we get closer to the target, we see that, hey, you know what? Maybe it'd be better to move this guy over here and move this guy over here. And so let's, let's change our standard order of March, our standard patrolling order, because it'll, it'll be easier when we get to the target.

Speaker 3:          01:19:53       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:19:55       Don't do that. Don't do that. You have your standard operating procedures are for a reason. You have them. And when you start pulling yourself out of the standard operating procedures for good reason, that's going to come back and bite you. It's, it's not gonna work out good. So be flexible.

Speaker 1:          01:20:17       This is going to be an interesting statement and be flexible but stick to the plan but be ready to adjust but stick to the plan and that's totally contradictory and I know that and I apologize, but that is what leadership is. Leadership is balancing those dichotomies in leadership is knowing when, hey, we stayed with our standard operating procedure. We're going to hold through it through this little thing right here. You know there's been, there's a little small terrain feature we didn't expect. We could change our plan right now and adapt to that in the unlikely event that or the the small chance that something happens and we'll be better for it at that moment. No, stay with your standard operating procedure. But then when something dramatic happens and you need to make a change, you do it aggressively, you do it dynamically and then you continue to observe, Orient, decide and act and stick. Keep beating the enemy inside the [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:21:12       Ooda loop. That's it. Next question, Jocko. Yes. An Echo. Oh,

Speaker 1:          01:21:27       Bjj ex partner is training in another gym. Now my head coach banned him

Speaker 3:          01:21:34       from coming back. The question.

Speaker 1:          01:21:39       So dojo, loyalty versus freedom.

Speaker 3:          01:21:43       Okay, what up?

Speaker 1:          01:21:45       So there is some tradition behind this actually. Yup. And the tradition is actually the attrition of the Crayon, which means that's so crayon. She is a, it's a Brazilian word and it's a name, right? It's a, it's a name from a character in a Brazilian soap opera. You're looking at me like you didn't know that, did you? This, I didn't know you didn't know this, but of course everyone knows [inaudible] Jitsu Korean. She came from, it's a character in a Brazilian soap opera that was like a, a backstabber look. An unloyal guide. Yeah. Right. And so when, especially back in the early days for me in Jujitsu, which was pretty early days in America for Jujitsu in the 90s if anyone was going from gym to gym or even left a gym permanently to go to another gym, they were labeled this horrible word. It was the, it was the worst thing you could call somebody, right?

Speaker 1:          01:22:49       It was like, yeah, this guy's a crunchy. And that meant that they were a trader. Yeah. That's what it meant. And there's also, so that's, there's a tradition of it in Jujitsu, right, of this idea that if you change gyms or you trained in a different place, you're a coach. Now there's a little backlash against that. And there's people that have, you know, I a matter of fact, we used to joke about being like team crayon. She was, we were all training at different places and trying to find the best places to train. I, but there's, beyond that, there's a, there's a martial arts kind of tradition as well, which is, you know, loyalty and gratitude to your instructor, right? That's a, that's a fairly understood tradition, not just in the martial arts, but in any arena where you're learning something from somebody that's putting their time and effort into you to instruct you in something.

Speaker 1:          01:23:44       And there's also a practical level of reasoning behind this. And that is competition, right? So if you're going to be competing and you compete with a guy at your gym that's got an unbelievable triangle, and then somebody else comes from another school and they are basically wrong with that guy. And they said he's got a really good triangle. Now you're in a competition against that guy. And he tells his buddy, hey, that guy you're gonna compete against has a really good triangle watch out for is triangle. You know, that can change the outcome of the match. You know, the details of it and all that stuff that can change the outcome of a match. So there's a practical level to it. You know, there's also sharing moves, right? And if certain schools might have a really good series of moves are moves and all of a sudden someone goes to, you know, train somewhere else, they can share that move.

Speaker 1:          01:24:37       And that's bad. And you know what's interesting is in every business, most businesses that I work with, I should say they have their own little worlds, right? And they have their own kind of loyalty and Crayon. She, and if you, if you're at you, you pick an industry, people are good in that industry. And when they change companies, they bring with them the same kind of thing. They bring maybe some secret sauce, maybe some moves, maybe they know some personalities, they know the weakness of that other company. So when they leave, there's a loyalty factor that comes into it. Now that being said, loyalty goes both ways. And I've talked about this before. The student should be loyal, right? But the teacher has to be loyal as well. That means they have to be teaching solid stuff. That means they need to, you know, train correctly.

Speaker 1:          01:25:27       That means they need to offer enough classes, all kinds of things right there. The teacher, oh, some loyalty to the students. And on top of that, on top of that, this is America, right? This is America. And in America, you pay to go to a school. You pay money, right? It costs you money. And I always use this example when people ask me about this in America, just because you normally get your pizza from Domino's doesn't mean that if you feel like you can't get to call up little Caesar's and some common cause, it's getting, it's America, l. A. N. N. N. If guess what? If little Caesars makes a better pizza, you're going to maybe order even more often. Yeah. So it's, there's, there's competition, right? And you want to end up where you get the best pizza and there's so, so there's some advantages to looking for that good pizza.

Speaker 1:          01:26:23       There's, there's, and there's some advantages to traveling around and good training at different places because you're going to get different, um, schools with different instructors that have different specialties and different styles so that can be advantageous. There's also some disadvantages to school. They'll go into a bunch of different schools. Number one is your teacher doesn't really know you, so now your teacher doesn't know your style, doesn't know what moves would be good for you. They also don't see you progress because you're only coming back every once in a while. And whenever they don't, they don't see you getting any better and they're not, they're not really maybe as comfortable teaching you everything because you're not really their students. And you know what man? It is a, it's a, it's a, it's a powerful thing to teach someone Jujitsu and him and it's, it's an effort and there's an emotional component to it. When you teach somebody Jujitsu, there's an emotional thing that you're giving them something and there's an emotional level in there somewhere that says, you know what, I'm giving you this. Not going to hold it over your head, but you know, there's this little song from there. You, I'm not going to say you owe me anything, but you owe me a little something.

Speaker 2:          01:27:38       Wait, wait, like, like what you like, so I taught you this. So now you need to go and not mess it up or you got to represent or is it like don't use this to, I dunno. I think what he means.

Speaker 1:          01:27:49       I think it's a little bit of both of, you know, I'm investing all this in you, right? Sure you're giving me 100 bucks a month, but what I'm giving you is worth more than a hundred bucks a month. Like we know that, right? So give me something back. What do I want back and want you to train with me? You know what I mean? Just, hey, you going to go to another school and you're going to train there. Sometimes I understand that, but oh, wait a second, now I'm just your part time teacher. Okay, well I'm not going to invest very much in you anymore. Right? So there's a, there's an emotional component to it. Now, again, back to the advantages, because there's a dichotomy of everything, right? You're rolling with different people at different schools. Like, is it one thing that's nice about our schools? We got, uh, we got different instructors with different styles. I mean, between Dean and Jeff, they are literally at the opposite end of the spectrum, which is fricking awesome to have there at the opposite ends of the spectrums of the Jujitsu skillset. Right? They're just crazy different. They almost don't look like they're doing the same sport. And when I trained with both of them, I don't feel like I'm doing the same sport different. It's just a totally different game. But you've got James Nielsen

Speaker 4:          01:29:03       who's got his own style of Jujitsu, which is insane. Uh, Greg train, obviously you got him combinant hot, whom I missing Adam. He's teaching hose his own little different style. Who else? Jeff, Jeffrey Owl. Jeffrey House got his bad ass game fast. Me, I don't know what I don't teach myself, but I'm sure that there is a different element there. Yeah. But you coach up and stuff like people learn from me. I know. I like a lot of stuff I learned from you, you know, and like you're like, um, uh, to, to tillage, whatever, you know, like you train with Jeff all the time, you're going to learn some real creative dynamic stuff you learned from Dean, you're going to learn a lot of stuff like in, you know, in that way. So I think a lot of people still, even though you're not instructing you, they do learn a lot from you.

Speaker 4:          01:29:50       Yeah. And I do teach from time to time. Um, but yes, I do. And I do when I teach, a lot of times when I'm teaching, I might not be teaching the class. Right, right. I'm saying, hey buddy, go check this out. Yeah, it's over here. So, so those are advantages. If you were at a school with one instructor, then I could see where you'd be going, man. Okay. There could be an advantage if I go try some other instructors. Again, there's a trade off because now, now you start learning something. I said, I actually see this more with striking, which with striking training where guys that move around from different coach, different striking instructors, a lot they don't, it's not like Jujitsu where you can incorporate it in and you learn something from some other guy and you bring it into your game and you change it a little bit.

Speaker 4:          01:30:38       When I see people move striking coaches a lot, I see their game actually deteriorate in my opinion because striking is more instinctive. It's an instinctive thing, right? You're throwing your combos and you let them go, like you let your combos go and you react. It's, it's just something that happens. It's more mechanical, so when you train mechanically to react and to throw your combos the way you're throwing them and then all of a sudden you change that and you want to throw him a different way. I think it trips people up. I think it sets them backwards a little bit. Whereas digital you can incorporate new games, different parts of games more fluidly. And also striking when you're training, striking, you did too short, you learn moves from the Co, your instructor, he learned, you know, some timing stuff, but it's like instruction. But then you have to train with a multitude, like all your training partners introduced to and that's part of your training. So if you go striking, it's not really like that. In fact, most strikers they'll stay, they'll stick with one coach and then they'll have a multitude of sparring partners that changes. And Jujitsu just by its own nature is already like that. Yeah. Yeah. And when you spar against other people striking though your fundamental movements, they'll change a lot less than they will when you're rolling. We just took down a bunch of different people using more of your body. There's just striking

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       is linear. Yeah, morning. And Jujitsu is completely not linear. So therefore when you're training something that's linear and you start going off that line, it trips you up in my opinion. But we do Jitsu, it can be beneficial at times too. Um, train with some other people. Advantages and disadvantages. So I guess to get to these question, long winded answer, um, one, you know, what is it? The head coach banned him from coming back. That's a bummer. That's a bummer. I, I'm, I'm sorry to hear that. I've never banned anyone from our school for going and training in another school. Yeah. I'm not intimidated by that. Right. If someone goes, Hey, I'm going to go train it, there's other school, I'm like, cool. And they come back because they get there and they go, okay, this is cool, but I'm going to come back to where we get this training that we have at victory.

Speaker 1:          01:33:00       Right. Which I'm comfortable with. And if someone goes somewhere and goes and goes, oh, I like this place better than victory. That's cool. Good luck. I mean, it's all, and you know, in a year they come back and go, yeah, I'm coming back. You know, I don't get mad at them because everyone's on their own journey, I guess you could say. Everyone's finding their own path and I'm not going to force people down a path. I might recommend a path, you know, I might say, you know, and I do that, you know, that's what, that's what we have the gym for. It's like here's a path man. And it's wide open. It's a beautiful path with incredible Jujitsu practitioners. So I don't, I'm kind of bummed out to here, you know? But that happens. But I do understand and I think that's what if I was, if I were in that position where I'm at a school and my training partner leaves and then he gets banned that I don't like that. I don't like that. Yeah. Let me get some,

Speaker 2:          01:33:55       yeah. I think security group and hear everywhere is kind of different. Here is kind of a situation here in southern California. God, especially in disability, Nicholas situation, we got the Jujitsu everywhere. Everywhere. Yes. So, and it's literally on every street corner. In some cases you can literally walk comfortably, comfortably. It's like one block to the next one and it's a good one too. That's the thing. There's just a schools everywhere. I'm sorry for those of you that live in the non Jujitsu parks in the world, I'm sorry, we have a lot of g do her in San Diego we have like our and southern California in general. Orange County, la is crazy. So you figure in San Diego what's going to kind of be a result of that is like our situation. For example, we have dean who's kind of the, the main guy who kinda came in with the school, right?

Speaker 2:          01:34:47       Remember Dean had the small kind of school do the boxing club, came to throw down is what it was called, became victory. But with Dean was like a bunch of guys like for Ileus. Um, James, nils, nils thin. Some other guys from Fabio Santos and we all trained together at least was instructor, like all these guys. And then some guys went and open their own school now. So not as a result of that whole situation. Sure. We have other schools, but they're kind of still are guys in a weird way. There are different things. So if I go train with the [inaudible], which I Johnny for he another one who my instructor for a little while, I'll go treat with Johnny sometime. And then w is that, is that a fantasy situation? No. Yeah. I mean even technically. Is that a crunchy situation though? You're asking me technically, I would say, I would say back 10 years ago.

Speaker 2:          01:35:35       Yeah. That would be a major crouch situation. Is it right now for me? No. I want you to get better at Jujitsu, right? Yes or no. And if, if you got an opportunity to go, you're going to be trained at another school. That's cool. Yeah. Cause it's, it's, it's gonna make you better. It doesn't, it doesn't offend me. You know what? I'm not a jealous husband. Right. I'm not jealous of, of that. I don't think, oh, what if he goes and never comes? I know you, I know where it's at. Right. And, and, and so it's all good. You know who I'm coming home to them. That's right. That's right. Well, I think the culture just in general is shifting. And I think this is this, like in southern California, it's going to be more like this, like way more laid back. Of course he get, you know, little, little tiny little groups of people who still believe that even though, but the really the community like that, in fact, have you considered studio five 40?

Speaker 2:          01:36:26       That's a crayon. Ge, GM might will be called Crayon, GE capital all the way down to the instructors, not Fabio Santos would teach there one day if I'm just on, just has his own gym by the way. Arizona. Kevin, by the way, same thing with the Higgs. Like all these are guys who came from other academies and they invite whoever and they actually have other fabulous currently. Yup. You can go visit when I visit all the time, you know, everyone knows each other. So it's like the culture is different. And I think, I think with our gym it's not as, uh, not as pronounced as that, but we definitely, I mean, people come in every day from, we're all over. How many victims were represented today, Matt? There was guys from all over San Diego, guys from all over the country, a victory, you know, showing up from Seattle trooper wanting to get his game on, you know.

Speaker 2:          01:37:11       Right on, you know I haven't tell America yeah, that's right. These, these mode up there. Yeah, he was good and that, and that's the cool thing you said at Dean said it, he said, I encourage you to go to other gyms or I mean not to be some sweared spy big Bro. If you want to go get training, cause I was going up to Eddie Bravo's when, this was long time ago when he, when he was at like legends and I was going up there for work or whatever and um, you know, I knew about that or it's like, oh is that kind of backstabbing if I go train, you didn't tell me that you were doing that. Actually I do. It wasn't about any brothers one, but it was about something else. I did tell you and he said the same thing. He was like, Bro, you get as much training as you can, you know, if you want to, if you want to be a part of this association academy or whatever, then up to you and

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       I'm glad you're here, whatever, and I don't think personally that you're going to do it, but pray your care date, learn Jujitsu. And if you can learn some Jujitsu over there, like more of a certain type, then you can hear or anywhere, fine. Go do it. Yeah. He said the moral juices you learn the better. So I was like, Dang, quit from Dean lister right there. Yeah. That more digits or you learn the better. Yeah. And then, and then so even to kind of go above and beyond that is when you, okay, well let's say, you know what I got to when to interject here is, especially for some of these academies out there, men Jiu Jitsu it, it's like you, you're a doctor because you went through 10 years of school to get your black belt. Just like a doctor goes. And what sucks is when you're a doctor, you make x amount of money.

Speaker 4:          01:38:37       It's a very steady paycheck and you're kind of set. Jujitsu doesn't mean anything. That black belt that you worked 10 years for doesn't get you paid. So the reason I'm saying this is some of the people that are more defensive about this, if they're an instructor and they have a small academy, they need, they, you're financially supporting them. They worked hard to do that. They've invested in you, they counting on you. So when you just go, oh, you know, I'm gonna go train somewhere else that, that not only does it hurt them emotionally, like I said, cause man, when you put some effort into somebody, you feel like, oh, you're going to leave after I gave you all of that and you didn't give it to him cause you, they paid, but you gave them the value that you get out of Jujitsu is not worth $100 a month.

Speaker 4:          01:39:18       It's worth $1,000 a month. It's worth, it's worth a ton of money. Keeling put that on his, uh, on, on some social media posts that he, because he got his black belt shoe and when he did, he's like, well, you're rich. When you got something that money can't buy. And that's the truth, right? And, but that black belt doesn't get you any money. It doesn't mean anything. So there's another component to this whole thing that if you're leaving and going to different schools and someone thinking, Oh man, I'm going to lose, you know, this is how I feed my, there's, you know, Jujitsu is, you want to become a Jujitsu instructor, you're generally not going to become a rich person, right? Not financially rich. So there's that component too. Now, luckily we have a big gym and it's a little easier for guys to come and go.

Speaker 4:          01:40:02       It's okay. You know, we're not sweating it as bad. Um, and yeah, so you gotta, you gotta keep that in mind as well that your, your coach that's poured more than what you've paid them. Because I don't just want to say, hey look, I'm paying for this instruction so you owe it to me and I'll go do whatever I want. That's to base of a statement to make truly Jujitsu has more value than the hundred dollars a month you're paying for it. Yeah, and you'd really, as a quote unquote customer or member, I mean everyone's different. There's sure there's exceptions to this, but generally you don't want that anyway. Even if you think you do. Like I, I sh I can be free to come and go and technically you are free to come and go as soon as you are, but don't think that like everyone's going to be just a hundred percent fine with it all the time because when, when you, when you come in, like how you said like it's a kind of a two way street, you would hopefully, I hope my coach takes pride in what he taught me for sure.

Speaker 4:          01:40:57       Hope my coaches like I care about how good you become for sure. I hope he's not the guy who's like, give me the check, I'll teach my moves and who cares about how good you get an, I don't want that guy. You don't want that guy. Yep. So there is that. And so that makes sense is it is that two way street, but as a competitor or a practitioner guy learning as a student, especially when you reach a certain level and you've been training with kind of the same, even like 2025 guys will say you've been training with these same 20 which is a lot of guys, by the way, totally strained with, you've been trained with them for, I don't know, whatever, eight years we'll say. And then you go to another gym, man, that's a way different look. So it's like fresh brand, new types of training, you know, it's like you're almost going to competition, but you're not competing because we need to compete.

Speaker 4:          01:41:43       You get to go against people who never trained with before. Yeah. So yeah, different guys, different. And that's, aside from even the debt, different teddy meetings. You know what I find when I go into situations, when I, when I trained with somebody that doesn't, I don't train with all the time, it's just you, you feel a lot better at Jujitsu. Cause they don't because they don't know you're gay, you're gay and you know, we, you know, everyone's got their own little special thing. So I always feel like a little bit better when I go see it. And that's part of my point where if you train with 25 guys, those 25 guys, they know your game. And not to say it's not good drinks, good training, but they know your game. So it may not be as accurate as far as like training competition or something like that after a while.

Speaker 4:          01:42:22       So when you go to these new places you get, that's an additional layer of, of training. You get another subject on this as a kind of always bummed me out when I would hear from my Jujitsu friends that have we been in San Diego for 20 something years and all of a sudden be like, oh, we can't come to your school because our instructor doesn't want us to. And I always be like, Bro, the, yeah, that's, so that's like, I wouldn't tell somebody that I'm not trying to control people. Yeah. And it bums me out. So that actually brings up another subject that I feel like I have to talk about because we got a lot of people out there that are starting Jujitsu for the first time. A lot of troopers that are getting in the Jujitsu game, which is awesome. It's awesome. And I get a lot of people saying, oh, what school should I train at in wherever?

Speaker 4:          01:43:08       Throw a dart at a map in America. And that's what they're asking me about. First of all, I don't know all those instructors. Now generally, you know, somebody that does Jujitsu, we'll look at a website and see what a guy's credentials are and say, yeah, that guy looks like a legit black belt or legit brown belt. Or even a guy asked me the day, is it worth learning from a purple belt if there's no one else around them? Like absolutely. Absolutely. So, but people ask me about these schools and I kind of give them my best guests. Like, you know, I'll take a look at the website and um, you know, see if there's a backlog. You don't need to ask me. By the way, Google look at their record, make sure that they do Brazilian Jujitsu, not some other form of Jujitsu. Um, just, just, you can figure

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       it out. You don't need, you're going to go to the school and assess. But what I want, the main point that I wanted to bring up isn't that it's just this part here, is that being into Jujitsu doesn't mean that a person is a good person. And being a black belt in Jujitsu doesn't have anything to do with their character as a person. And I hate to say that. Um, and, and there is a level of, to get to be a black belt in Jujitsu. Sure. You could say in general it means you're a committed person. In general. It means you're a hardworking person in general. It means that you've been humbled by your experiences on the map in general. But it is no way a fact. And there are people in the Jujitsu game that are swindlers and fiefs and they're untrustworthy. And there's a black belt in Jujitsu that can be bullies and there's people in Jiu Jitsu that can be predators and you know, Jujitsu, it's a power.

Speaker 1:          01:45:08       And sometimes people that are power hungry recognize that power and they pursue the gaining of Jujitsu power and then they abuse that power. So like any, um, abusive situation where one person has a perceived power over another person, it can get very ugly. And there's all kinds of abuses that I've seen take place over the years and a Jujitsu world, financial abuses, physical abuse, and even sexual abuse. So I just wanted to get that out there. That being a Jujitsu black belt, Brown belt, purple belt, blue belt, white belt doesn't make someone a good person. So you need to be careful if you do two doesn't make you a god and it certainly doesn't make you a saint, but it does give you power and everybody has to recognize that there's people out there that are, their goal is to abuse power. And I think the same thing goes with any glorified position in life, you know, and I actually see that sometimes with, you know, uh, uh, standing in a company, a being a veteran, like being a veteran doesn't mean that you're a saint by any stretch of the imagination being a seal. Right? I know a lot of seals and there's plenty of seals. They got out of the seal teams and they're upstanding awesome citizens. Mothers also scoundrels and Ms. Green

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       since swindlers like I said, and they're using the seal name that they have to promote themselves and to take advantage of other people. So,

Speaker 5:          01:47:00       okay,

Speaker 4:          01:47:00       keep your guard up, keep your guard up and make sure you judge people not based on what Jujitsu belt they have.

Speaker 5:          01:47:08       Hmm.

Speaker 4:          01:47:09       Or what veteran status it is that they brag about, but who they are as a person.

Speaker 5:          01:47:16       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:47:17       And I just wanted to get that out there because we sit here and talk about Jujitsu

Speaker 4:          01:47:24       and there's so many great people in Jujitsu, man. It's wonderful. You roll into some series, you see somebody with cauliflower ears and you start talking to me. It's great. And you, you, you know, there's just a bunch of great people. I mean we were on the map today for two hours, you know, and we train for an hour and 15 minutes and they were just hanging out just talking because that's what we do and we're talking about everything and it's, so there's great people in Jujitsu. It's a great family, a situation. But you do have to be careful. It is not a blanket. Um,

Speaker 5:          01:47:59       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:47:59       Blanket statement that because someone's a Jujitsu black belt for instance, that they are a trustworthy person cause there's some scumbags out there. Yeah, I'm, and then that's that can, and the fact that, and I talked to Brady about this every once in a while where you go in Jujitsu and it seems like everyone just identifies with each other and later on you find out, oh shoot, that guy's like a lawyer and that guy is a doctor. Or that guy's like a different and that guys or whatever and this person's from this area and we all just get along on the, Yep. Everyone gets along. And the black belt, he has so much like he tell him, well like for the most part it's PR. It's pretty, you know, everyone's really good at Jujitsu for the most part. Right. And that's why you can kind of, especially if you're kind of new or maybe like their first year or something like that, where you're going around and Dang, my whole year of Jujitsu, it's been great.

Speaker 4:          01:48:49       People come on, the man in the, oh my gosh, she's all my new friends. That's a big one meant all my new friends is so cool and I got this whole thing. It's like your whole life is better. And then, so your guard is down in the in call, almost like a conditioning way. You're just like, hey, if you're in, did you get two? You must be dope in every way. And then you get these like outliers that they're in the game, you know, and they, and they take advantage like there where they can, you know, and some do, but yeah, you gotta, you gotta always kind of watch over that. Yep. So just if your spider senses are going up or first of all, turn them on, turn them on, turn them off. And then if they go up, start to maybe ask more questions than you are. And don't get yourself in a situation where you know you're going to regret what's going on because you believed that someone was a good person because they had some status that you consider to be an honorable status. Yup. Hate to say it, man. I hate to, I hate to have to kind of bring that, bring all that, all that Jiu Jitsu down in this, you know, there's, and then I'll tell you something else. There's aspects of Jujitsu where people lose

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       their minds, right? They get crazy. And some of it, you know, with that whole school thing we just talked about where people start going crazy about who owns students, right? No. Like No. Like I'm on own in any students. I'm happy to have people that train at my gym and I'm happy to work with them and train them. Well, I don't know, hone anybody. Right. And there's people that get that crazy. There's people that get crazy parents that goes cycle on their kids and go level seven. You know, I'm living vicariously through their kids and push their kids until the kids hate Jujitsu. And I'll tell you, I push my kids too hard when they were younger for sure. That's looking back. You know, everyone's, oh, the big parenting advice from Jocko, man, I push my kids too hard. It made them compete too much, mate who compete in harder brackets.

Speaker 1:          01:50:38       Older kids have your kids all the time and it made you did so. Not Fun. But I didn't break them mentally from that. So you gotta be careful that you gotta be careful of the whole. Um, you gotta be careful of Jujitsu is a power and it's really easy to get suckered into the point where you feel like you should exercise your power over other people, um, on the mats or otherwise. You know, if you, if you ever go into the gym and it's making you feel really good to tap everyone out, like you're feeling better than them, just start to check yourself, man. Because that's not, that's not helping you because there's someone out there that's can tap you. There's someone else. And if you're taking those abusives out on other people, so again, to beginners in Jujitsu, it's, you're going to get tapped out. You're going to get tapped out a lot, but there shouldn't be anyone that is smashing you and abusing you. That's a much higher belt than you write. Another white belt might not even get that yet. They're just happy they're submitting you. Right? But when anyone that's been around a little bit more, they should be, you should feel like, hey, that guy just, he didn't abuse me. Yeah. She didn't abuse me. She just beat me and I know what happened and it's cool.

Speaker 2:          01:51:54       Hmm. Yeah. In, in even that, that's kind of weird and interesting too where abuse can come in weird different forms to, you know, like if cause there's a difference. Okay. So, so like Jeff Glover for example, if you, if Jeff Bavor is cause he has fun when he rolls, that's a big part of his game. And um, let's say, Oh, I'm a new white belt, maybe, you know, and I come my role against Jeff Glover and heat and it's, let's say it's I a six minute round and just in training in Jeff taps him out 25 times. That's not, that's not abuse. You know, you're just, you're just doing some missions whole on you. He's doing his thing or whatever. If someone's like grinding you and in doing, you know, abusing you or trying to make you look stupid or something like that because like, oh yeah, I know dude, you see you don't kind of thing. Or maybe there's some girls that he's trying to pro, then that starts to get into music. But I

Speaker 4:          01:52:47       don't ever watch me and dean role because when one of us is having a good day and the other one's having a bad day, it's straight up abusive. But that's you and dean. And you'll notice that if when you established like solid training partners, then that becomes part of the game. I'm going to try to abuse you. And so that's different. That's what I mean by like dynamic as far as like we're recognizing what abuse is because if you get tapped out 25 times in the, it seems like, Dang, you didn't have to like go black belt on him. He's a light bulb. Well, well, yeah, he went black belt on him, but he wasn't abusing them. You know what I mean? That's like that. That's a well within the confines of the game. For sure. For sure. There's a big difference between that. I know this to translate this for people that don't do Jujitsu yet.

Speaker 4:          01:53:29       Uh, think about also this with any status structure, right? In the work, in the military, in, in the hierarchy of any company or industry where if you're feeling good about bossing people around, you're doing something wrong, man, you're doing something wrong. If your goal of what you're doing is based on you, if you're saying, look, I'm going to be the best and I'm gonna be, this is what's important to me. Yeah. If that's what you're saying is a leader, put yourself in check because that's just pure ego coming out when you're saying, look, I want to be the best in this. And I think there's a weird thing that happens with people that are go getters and they hear someone that's a go getter that we'll hear some person that's been successful in business and that person that's been successful in business will be like, you know what?

Speaker 4:          01:54:29       I said I was going to be the best and here I am on the best. And you've got to set your goals, you've got to put 'em out there and you got to let everyone know that you're going to run them over if you're getting your way. And that sounds really cool. And, and I guarantee if you went back and you follow that person through their career, they were completely not like that. They were, they were politically sensitive. They understood other people's needs. They didn't go, Hey, nice to meet you. I'm going to take over this business. No, they didn't do that. They said, hey, nice to meet you. How are you doing? What are you, what are we trying to make happen here? They made it a goal for the team. Even if the deep underlying goal is, uh, is a selfish one, let's say the outer goal should not be that.

Speaker 4:          01:55:11       It should not be, hey, I'm going to be the best. I'm going to be the ruler of this company. I'm going to be, no, we don't want to hear that. Like when you, you, you know, I just take all, I want to be the president of the United States who wants that person to be present, the United States and I sure don't, I don't want that person to be president. I would say it's if someone says, I'm going to be the CEO of this company now, what do you think of that? You think, okay, so this person's ego is really, really big and do you think yourself, you know what, that I don't like that. You need to put that. So if that's your

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       attitude and you think you're being fired up, keep that goal internal. Don't be announcing that gold blue side. State your goals and let the world know you're here. No, because you sound like an egomaniac. What you should say is like, you know what I want to do with this company? I want to help this company grow the best I can. And you know what's important to be about being in a leadership position? What's important to me about being in a leadership position is making sure that the people underneath me, they get better and they reach their goals. This isn't about me. This is about the people that are on my team and I want to make them successful. Now, who wants to work for that person? I do sign me up. But when I say, Hey boss, nighttime, nice to meet you, what's your, you know what, what's your goal here at the company?

Speaker 1:          01:56:32       My goal is to be CEO, to be the boss. So you're going to step on my back to get their sounds like fun. Don't sign me up for that guy. I don't want to work with that person. I want to work with somebody that's about the team and I don't want to work with somebody that's gonna be abusive, just like I don't want to train it. Anybody's Jujitsu Academy that's going to have that abusive mentality and they're out there. So I wanted to tie that back into the business world. The instructor, I'm the instructor. Your instructor, you don't go into Napoleon dynamite, you know bout your sensei. They make fun of that. And it's funny and, and there's, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that. There's a lot of tradition in Jujitsu as well. You know, you bow to your instructor, you now when you come on and off the mat.

Speaker 1:          01:57:14       Yeah, I'm not super into that stuff. You know what I mean? I'm laid back. I know I'm, I'm pretty laid back when it comes to the Jujitsu traditions. Yeah. Most of the bowing to the instructor in Jujitsu is more like bar. It's like bow to Jujitsu almost like and not foul like bow down. It's more D, it's like show respect. Like if you go to even more traditional schools, even when Rhonda was teaching at our school, you know, you buy it to all of the instructors because they're the ones providing that you do. And then you bought it Helio Gracie cause he's the one who kind of provide, you know, so it was more about that. You did too. Yeah. It doesn't have that feel and you've got to make sure that you're not getting that crossover where it goes from, hey bow to Jujitsu and flavor.

Speaker 1:          01:57:54       Pay respect to a beautiful thing to bow to me. Yes. And it's the same thing in the business world. If you're saying, look, there's nothing wrong with treating your CEO with respect and your CEO should be treated with respect or your boss, you treat your bothers with respect. Absolutely. Like, Hey boss, what do you need me to do? Hey, hey sir, in the military, you know, you call those senior officers, sir. There there's, there's nothing, you know, shouldn't feel degraded by doing that. But if for instance, in the military, if it's like, hey, you call me sir, you know, okay, I see what I'm dealing with here in the, in the business world, if people are, you know, if you as an individual are thinking, you better show me the respect I deserve. You got issues, I got issues. You got to earn that. If someone's not giving you the SPEC, don't, don't look at them and demand it. Yeah. Look at yourself and demand that you become a better leader where they give you the respect, not because you asked for it, but because you deserved it. Yeah. There's a big difference. That's funny man. Give me the respect. I deserve to have them either respect

Speaker 2:          01:58:59       most of the time, most not all of them. Most of them. Once someone says yes,

Speaker 1:          01:59:03       give me the respect, idea, deserve. It's when they are being given the respect they deserve, which is probably not. Most of the time when people are saying, give me the respect I deserve, they don't deserve the respect they're asking for me.

Speaker 2:          01:59:15       Yeah, they need to get their head together. Awesome. What are we got time for? One more. That's one. Jocko, I had had a few rough months, some setbacks at work that hurt me financially, which is stressed out. My family, I'm late on some payments. I'm falling further behind at work. I don't want to tap out, but I just don't know where to start.

Speaker 1:          01:59:41       Well, you know what, that's, that's just kind of the way that life works. Sometimes it's Murphy's law. When things go wrong, they always seem to happen at once and they just compound on top of each other and it's, it's pretty easy sometimes to to feel beaten when you're faced with all those issues and all those problems and they all hit you at the same time. But let me tell you that that doesn't mean give up. In fact, it means the opposite. It means it's time for you to fight harder to dig in means it's time for you to go on the warpath and that starts with one of the fundamental laws of combat leadership. Prioritize and execute. What's the biggest problem? Well, what's causing the most stress? Family. Okay. Sit them down. Explain where you are at. Be Blunt, be up front, and then give them the simple plan of how you're going to get things back on track. Don't sugarcoat it. You give it to them straight. Next you got some, some late payments. Call those creditors up. Explain to them what's going on. Set up some kind of a of a, of a minimum payment plan so you can start making some progress and get them off your back. And then you got your job

Speaker 4:          02:01:38       right, your phone at work. Okay? Talk to your boss. Face it. Tell him that you're going to step up your game. Tell him you're going to be at work early. You're going to be at work late. You're going to be at work during lunch. You're going to be wherever you need to be whenever he needs you to be there. Tell him you're going to get after it and tell him that you were 100% committed.

Speaker 5:          02:02:05       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:02:05       Tufts supporting him and the company and the mission. And then you get started. And I'm going to tell you right now, it won't be easy. It will be hard because life is hard. That's what life is. And these challenges, these challenges that you face, they're going to do their best to take you down. Do not let them stand up. Dig In.

Speaker 5:          02:02:49       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:02:49       Line up those problems and confront them. Face them, fight them. Do not let them bring you down. In fact, in fact, let lose challenges. Raise you up. Let them elevate you.

Speaker 5:          02:03:10       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:03:11       Let their demands and their trials make you stronger. Let the adversity you face today,

Speaker 5:          02:03:23       okay.

Speaker 4:          02:03:23       Turn you into a better person tomorrow. So, so when the future, you look back at these struggles heg you say to them, thank you. You made me better. And I think that's all I've got for tonight. So echo let's cloves it on out. How can everyone get on board with the program here and, and sport? The little podcast we got going in enforcement, not reinforcement. Reinforcement. Yes. So indeed few ways. First on top of supporting this podcast and you're going to want to support yourself, I think supplementation. Why don't we talk about this? I know, I know. Um, anyway, on it has the best supplements. We all know this. Krill oil dot. My krill oil in echoes in the game. Actually I'm, I'm

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       staying on it every month anyway. So on it on a.com/jocko 10% off. So supplement your wallet as well. So the Krill oil, that's for your joints warrior bars as well. I think Donald's a good one. Yes. Room Tech. Shroom tech is kind of, okay. So victor was talking about, he's like, I'm on shroom tech today, all fired up yet. So tell me what you think about this. So I used to take shroom tech all the time and be like, and I felt, and I felt like it kind of gave me an advantage because you know how cardio conditioning stuff is a tool in Jujitsu or can be if you use it. Do you think that's an advantage? Do, I think cardio has an advantage. [inaudible] tech is like all he took. Shroom tech doesn't count because I took shrooms deck and tapped out. Someone who I don't tap up.

Speaker 2:          02:05:30       There's, there's two ways to look at that. Well that's a word. Shroom tech is really good. Shroom tech did not make you tap out, tapped out, but indirectly it could have, you know what I mean? So I guess, I guess the answer to this would be since you were able with shroom tech to do more, it's pushing you harder so you're stepping up your game overall. Yeah, I'm allowed to train better because you can train harder because of your shroom tech. Yeah. So it is, as far as I'm concerned, permissible to do that because you're just trying to get yourself better and [inaudible] helps you do that. Now you might have to, you know, give a caveat, put us little asterisks next to your tap house on the shroom tech. So quite there. That's like a wind ATM today. When we got done training, I was like, you know, I didn't take any shroom tech today.

Speaker 2:          02:06:16       So maybe you know, and you were like, I either did I, so I said okay. It was a level playing field in Stephen. Yeah, the, the um, it's like when you run the hundred meter dash in the wind, the sun, there's a strong wind like you'll, you'll get the record, but there's a star there asked her, he says wind dated record. Oh really? This is wind aided? Yes. Still your record. But it's the wind ate. It sort of, I know is that they try and do you like Yo when you're, when you get your shroom tech and you set your PR in, you know, in like, you know, a wad or something like this. You got to put the star. There's no PR, but I was on a shoot. Yeah. Maybe. Maybe you don't have to do valid and do that. Maybe, I don't know. But you might anyway. Nonetheless, shroom tech sport though. There's two, this shroom tech. It's the shroom tech something else. I'm talking about this. Yes.

Speaker 2:          02:07:06       Yeah. Luckily I haven't had to take the immune. Yeah. But no, that's for general immunity. Right. That's so close to the thing. But anyway, that one, probably not a peak performance enhancing supplement. Maybe it is indirectly anyway on it. Uh, it's there from audit. You get 10% off on a.com/jocko take the Alpha brain to think a little better. Like it makes you think it's proven. By the way that St lie, it's legitimately proved. Not like the 19%. The 90% is pretty legitimately through as far as I know. Cole Miller, Colt meal there, UFC fighter Mike Best. I mean I got an email today, got his rash guard, uh, just started Jujitsu like, you know, a lot of us have been and so emails me and says I was going to bring the email and read it. It's short. So he's like, um, he's like, hey man, I tapped out my Jujitsu attorneys.

Speaker 2:          02:07:58       Quite awesome. I tapped out my first blue belt today. Dang. And he said, guess what I was wearing? He said, I'm not going to attribute it to the rash guard specifically, but let's, let's face it. It was the rash guard. Okay. So that being said, there's some super rash guards on Jocko store.com I redid the website by the way. Not much in effect. It's just kind of redone nonetheless. This rash guards on there, they're cool. They improve your performance. 19% tech I guess. I mean apparently 19 to 35% really? That's the range evidently. Anyway. Cool. Rash guards. You can check those out. [inaudible] dot com there's some shirts there too. Was that you telling me that you saw someone with a shirt on? None. No, no victor. Victor was saying, oh paid above the so that's the thing when we, and I said this before of course.

Speaker 2:          02:08:55       So you know if you listen, you know that I try to put more than just the one layer on the shirt. It's kind of, there's a bunch of insights stuff. Actually if you talking about the layers on the shirts, it started to become a thing I'm telling. No, I'm saying cause it, you know why it's starting to become thing cause it cause it is a thing. So you're going to have to like on some future shirt, you'd have to actually put the word layers. Layers. Yeah. It might be don't either way. He was saying how he recognized the shirt and when you see someone else wearing like, you know, they, you know, so it's not like you see a quick silver shirt and it's like, Hey, I'm wearing critters. You know what I mean? It's different. It's way different. This stuff, you know, if you listen, you know, you're like, ah, anyway, check them out.

Speaker 2:          02:09:40       If you like, go grab one and you can support that way and force and then Amazon click through. What that it does is anytime you shop on Amazon, just clicked through on our website, Jocko, podcast.com or the store. There's a little section there. Uh, people can do a lot of Christmas and holiday shopping. Yeah. So if you really want to get your support on the game full speed, it doesn't cost anybody anything, doesn't, it's, it's just supports the podcast while you're doing your normal stuff. So that's awesome. That is appreciated. Yeah, man, it gets, I mean the key there really is to remember to click through before you go shop. That's it. Anyway. It's a good way to support them as on, so yeah, on the website again, you just click on the Amazon link before you do shopping, then boom, support, actively, efficiently, solid. Um, and then of course subscribe

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       on the, uh, on Itunes, on the iTunes or stitcher. And there's some other like Google play, Google play. Oh yeah, that's a good one too. Those little podcasts, layups, but yet be a subscriber. Men in the game, straight up. Write a review on the, maybe this is, I don't know what this is. It's just one of those things. We're at like 900 something reviews. Oh yeah. So of course I'm going to go home and write a hundred reviews tonight myself and get to a thousand, a thousand, a thousand reviews even mean. I know what's good about it is it is. If you wrote a review, I read it. I've read all the reviews that are on there and it's cool because it's good feedback and it lets us know that people are listening and that they're in the game. Yeah. Which is cool. That is plenty of them. And I want to get to a thousand for no good.

Speaker 4:          02:11:32       Of course, when he does that ego you think or maybe OCD or both? Cause you know how like you're like, hey, I don't, you know how like when you pump the gas, you know, and you're like, oh, I'm going to, I'm gonna get, if you're not filling up, you're like, I'm going to get it right on the $20 market. It's like, it's a weird thing. Anyway, something like that. Um, you know how like people, they'll celebrate, hey, I got to, you know, a thousand subscribers or whatever. You know, people, they'll celebrate in the upload, sit and be like, well, like, why didn't you celebrate at like 1,001 or nine, eight, nine. See, when I get to a thousand I won't celebrate anything. I'll be like, I need to get to 2000 and it's not even anything I can stop from my own brain thinking. He just thinks that way.

Speaker 4:          02:12:11       So yeah. So your thing is like different. Yeah, just like it's a, it's almost like a score and I go, oh well what's my score right now? Right now it's 920 to three yeah. I want my score to be a thousand. Why? I have no good reason. And you yet nonetheless subscribe. That's how you can support and youtube subscribe to that. You know if you're down, if you're in to youtube and watching videos, I'm subscribed to that. I think I'm going to put out another one here pretty soon. Yeah, we hear that Queen Bee are going to put on another one. We hear that a lot, you know? Hey, it kind of like the email lists. You know how like, oh, okay, I'll talk about in a second. But you don't like the email list? We have you sign up the insider's list and just sign up and be like, Hey, I'll send you, you know some, we'll send you some stuff.

Speaker 4:          02:12:55       I'm not going to send you stuff every day. I'm just kind of like the youtube, Hey, I'm going to put more videos. Maybe not every week, but you know there will be more, more than basically any. Meanwhile on my end, people are like, Hey Jocko, keep making a podcast every week. I say your end, they tell you, hey echo, can you make some more videos? And you're like, you know what? They can, they can wait low. That's the artist in you. No, no, no. That's nice. The artists right there. I'll, yeah, we'll do some more videos. I would hope that we're all sitting here holding our breath.

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       Their Echo Charles for you to make more than, yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:13:34       I see what you're doing. He gives you like stroking my ego. Like, oh we're waiting for your next video, but I'm like, you guys are waiting from wavy. I'm going to put on the video, be like, yes, I want to my video guys,

Speaker 1:          02:13:44       have you ever made, have you ever made a video that you got done and you said, I'm not even going to release this thing cause it's too bad.

Speaker 2:          02:13:49       Yes, I have a whole series. Yeah. Echo telling you bro. It's, yeah, there's like one of them's called, um, for people that you find on Facebook and like cone ends in it. It's like the people who take p one of them is like two people who take pictures of themself, but they want to act like they're taking a picture of something, you know? But it's like, it's like this thing and it just didn't come out good anyway. Nonetheless. Yeah. I am very weary of these things anyway, so yeah. Support that way. Oh, back to the store. Jocko store. Oh, there's some new stuff. Is it annoying to sit here and talk about like this stuff right here? Um, no, I don't think so. I mean, if, if I didn't have Debbie and everyone's saying, well, where's the girl stuff? You know, and they're just like, all right. You know, like not

Speaker 1:          02:14:39       maybe just so I think about it like, I always think like, okay, we can probably cut this, you know, hey, let's just run through, you know, how to support the podcast. Did you take three minutes? For some reason? It turns into a 15 minute conversation and I don't, I don't, it's, I never intend to do that. And then when I listened to it, I actually laugh at most of it and I think it's pretty funny. So I don't even know. We should do like a two hour podcast. I'll us just talking about how to support the podcast because it might be pretty funny cause you're laughing right now. I was laughing a second ago and maybe that'd be the greatest topic ever.

Speaker 2:          02:15:08       Okay. So in that regard, I, I'm not saying this is proof, but this evidence and this happened more than once by the way. So you know that we'll order a shirt and yeah, it's online so you can't try on the shirts. So people will be like, Hey, well you know, what's the shirt sizes or whatever. And they'll say, hey, I need a bigger size, or I don't know, I def forgot to change my address or something where, you know, they, they require it another shirt. Yeah. So there'd be times I'd be like, oh, I'll just send it to you. Like you got lost in the mail, whatever. I'll just send it so it just send it and they're like, no, no I do. Oh No, no. Here, this is what it was two. And that happened before. But here's, there's, here's a very specific one I'm thinking about.

Speaker 2:          02:15:47       It's where I sent apparently two shirts. They got two shirts they were supposed to get. One was supposed to get Wonka. Yeah. And they were like, I got two shirts, I'm keeping him tell me where to pay. Tell me like, tell him, tell me how I can pay, cause he can't go and click another, you know, it'll go in the order says that. And he was told where I can pay. I was like, no, I keep the shirt. That's all you, you know, give it to somebody. And they're like, I demand to pay. It's like part of the reason is to support this, the podcast, you know, so, and I'm Kinda like, Dang, there are enforcements out there who embrace the reinforcing. That's why. That's why I think this is relevant.

Speaker 1:          02:16:27       Well, yeah. Well, I guess my is, is

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       that when you were talking about this stuff, what should be a 32nd thing? Turns into a 15 minute thing. Light gets happening right now and when I listened to the podcast and I'll start going, oh, here come the advertisements. I got to make a note to say shorten these down. And then I say, Oh you know what? That was actually funny as hell. So I dunno, maybe I'm, maybe I'm just ultra sensitive. Yeah. Maybe just like the ritual thing. Mm. Maybe dug in. So what were you saying? The store? Yeah, the store. Hey there's, there's some new stuff is the first time I'm saying it publicly, but there's hoodies in there. They're pretty cool. Apparently Jocko says, oh good. I like them. I'm also like, I'd did the patches. Where there, there Ft. You know how j p last week said federal dark earth. Apparently it's flat.

Speaker 4:          02:17:23       Darker. Not to be confused with flat earth cause people won't. People think the earth is flat or we don't want Eddie Bravo to get fired up about being a flat cause he thinks that his conspiracy things that he believes in. I don't think so. Nobody's in all kinds of crazy conspiracies. Yeah Man, I'm not gonna argue. I'm not going to argue the rubber guard about with him. I don't want to talk about nothing else man. That's too, he's got too many facts and figures about stuff. You know, facts and figures about all kinds of conspiracy stuff that I don't want to argue with. It's all I'm good with him being in that world. I don't want to enter that world. I'm saying how that world and you know why, cause I guess I'm too blind to see. The reality is, okay, I'm going to stay blind.

Speaker 4:          02:18:13       You all good. But the salt flat, dark earth, there's a is, it's the official one where if you know, is it two by three? Two by three. Okay. So let's come up as far as the new stuff on Jocko, store.com [inaudible] to come and look at the stuff on there. If you like it, go grab one and you can enforce, reinforce and support this podcast that way, which is awesome. I appreciate it. You can also get some, some Jocko white tea, which I've been drinking liberally all night long and I'm feeling pretty good right now. How do you have some cause we're out. Yeah, well so I've got massive quantities. I actually told our supplier I will never, we will never run out of this again. How do we make that happen? And then they told me how to make it happen so it's going to be back in Amazon directly and we will never run out of it again. That's my hope. I ordered a lot of it. I learned a lot of it cause I didn't know that people are going to be so went to it. And then I realized, cause you know sometimes you're in a bubble. Yes. And you think something's really cool and no one else does. I have been in that bubble many times in my life where I thought something was really cool and then I get outside the bubble and people don't think it's cool my whole life. So I was under suspicion

Speaker 1:          02:19:29       that this situation where I like this tea, this random tea, and then I got it tweaked to my specific liking and I thought, well, okay, not only have I taken a random thing and then I've tweaked it to be specifically what I like. I'm thinking to myself like, what seven people in the world, we're going to dig this. Well, what I should have done was taken it and given it to a bunch of people and said, hey, is this, what do you think of this? Because by the time we did that we, we basically did that and you realize that it tastes really, really good. It's a unique, flavorful taste and I think that's like part one is that it tastes really good. It doesn't taste like anything else. It's just got a very, it doesn't taste like a juice. It doesn't taste like a tea.

Speaker 1:          02:20:12       What does it tastes like? It just tastes like it tastes like what it tastes like and it tastes good. And universally, universally people go, oh yeah, that's, that's, that tastes great. It's just a universally good tasting thing. And then on top of that, you get the micro dose of caffeine, just a microdose. So it's this thing that just comes in subsurface and just gives it to you, but it doesn't override your normal senses. And then on top of that, you've got the antioxidant thing, which for all I know, it's just just repairing and taking care of your body, right? So you combine all those things together and we've got something very popular on our hands. And again, I thought that inside my bubble, I thought it was something inside my bubble was going to be popular. But now I realize that it's a very, everybody loves the way it tastes and everybody loves the way it makes you feel.

Speaker 1:          02:21:00       So what I gotta do is order, you know, through the manufacturer, ordered a ton of it and go online. And you know, some people also said, hey, you know what, Jocko stuff cost too much. And it costs a lot because we got a high quality container to put it in the tin as it's known luxury, the luxury, the luxury is the luxe. I didn't say luxurious, I didn't, I forgot to rewind that part, but the tin costs a lot of money to make and so that's what it is. Well when people said it was too expensive, I said, okay, cool. I'll put a in box also. So we got to come in at a box. You can still get it in the team because you need at least one tin, right? Tactical multipurpose tactics when you probably need a few of them in your house. Pens, check screws and nails.

Speaker 1:          02:21:54       Check. Um, you auntie itself, check. And then you're also going to be able to buy it in big box with a hundred count in there. So we're taking care of you on that end. Yeah. Again, here I was, all I was wrote down to say was we have Jocko white tea unset. I talk about it for eight minutes. What is wrong with me? You gotta well, and you know what? I think it's too much Jocko. White tea has gotten me talking, got me mentally engaged at such a level that I need to just take it easy. Then it's that feedback loop. Also we've got a book, extreme ownership. It's about combat leadership. Therefore it's about all leadership written by myself and my brother Leif Babin and if you buy the audio version it gets read by myself and my brother Leif Babin so you can check that out is also an Amazon.

Speaker 1:          02:22:44       Appreciate it. Following that, if you happen to want to continue this little conversation that we're having right now or you just want to get after it on the interwebs, that's cool. You can do it. We are there. We're on Twitter, we're on Instagram and you know that we've had that face bookie echo. Echo is at Echo, Charles and I am at Jocko Willink and thanks to everybody for listening, for joining us as we join you trying to figure out how to get better and to my brothers in arms, in the military overseas, hunting down evil and destroying it.

Thanks for your vigilance and your courage under actual fire and the rest of you troopers out there listening, honing your skills, building buildings, creating creations, designing designs, developing developments, working on what you are working on.
