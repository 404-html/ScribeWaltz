Speaker 1:          00:00:01       This is Jocko podcast number 31 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Vornado Simpson watched three men concluding Hutto and Hudson go into a hut with a girl aged about 17 her trousers were forcibly removed. The girls held down while she was violated. Simpson observed this from the door. Fagan was also part of the girls or deal when they were finished. The helpless captive were shot dead. Her face completely blown away. Torres stabbed several people with a Bowie knife and was seen by Hutto raping a girl. She was crying, fighting, and resisting him. Another soldier held her down for Simpson. The crucial moment was when he shot the woman and baby. Soon after entering the village, I went to turn her over and there was a little baby with her that I had also killed. The baby's face was half gone. My mind just went. The training came to me and I just started killing old men, women, children, water buffaloes, everything.

Speaker 2:          00:01:30       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:01:31       we were told to leave nothing standing. We did what we were told regardless of whether they were civilians, they was the enemy. Period. Kill. If you don't follow a direct order, you can be shot yourself. Now what am I supposed to do? You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't. You didn't have to look for people to kill. They were just there.

Speaker 2:          00:01:58       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:01:59       I cut their throats, cut off their hands, caught out their tongue, their hair, scalp them. I did it. A lot of people were doing it and I just followed. I just lost all sense of direction. I just started killing any kind of way I can kill. It just came. I didn't know I had it in me after I killed the child. My whole mind just went. It just went and after you start, it's very easy to keep on. The hardest is to kill the first time, but once you kill, then it becomes easier to kill the next person and the next one and the next one because I had no feelings, no emotion, nothing. I just killed. I wasn't the only one that did it. A lot of people in the company did it. Hung them up all types of ways. Any type of way that you could kill someone. That's what they did that day and me lie, I was personally responsible for killing about 25 personally.

Speaker 1:          00:03:02       I don't think beforehand anyone thought we would kill so many people. I mean we're talking about four to 500 people. We almost wiped out the whole village, our whole community. I can't forget the magnitude of the number of people that we killed and how they were killed. Killed in lots of ways. Do you realize what it's like killing 500 people in a matter of four or five hours. It's just like the gas chambers. What Hitler did. You line up 50 people, women, old men, children and just mow them down and that's the way it was from 25 to 50 to 100 just killed. We rounded him up to meet a couple of guys, just put the m 16 on automatic and just mowed them down. Good evening, Echo. Good evening. Well, that was an excerpt from a book called four hours and me lie by Michael Bilton and Kevin Sim, and when I was prepping for this, I mentioned to a couple people that I was going to do me lie on the podcast next. And surprisingly, a lot of people didn't know what it was and, and I thought everybody knew about me. Lie To me, lie is a war crime. It's an atrocity. And what makes it so hard to talk about is that it was an atrocity and a war crime that was committed by American soldiers.

Speaker 1:          00:05:00       Now, of course there's people out there that like to claim that you know that America is this evil imperialistic empire, which I am killing you. It is not, not by any stretch. America isn't any incredibly benevolent nation with a conscience and a saw that as a whole is good in have we done some things in the past that don't reflect that we absolutely have, but for the most part, we have stood up for the week. We have liberated the oppressed. We defeated the Nazis, we defeated the Imperial Japanese army. We give aid and military assistance and education in money to less fortunate people all over the world all the time. We are a good nation filled with, for the most part, good people, but not all good people and people inside of people inside of humans. There can be something very dark in some times that darkness can override the light in. That is exactly what happened in a small village in Vietnam called me lie on March 16th, 1968 zero seven 15 in the morning, a massacre in atrocity, the murder of hundreds and hundreds of old men, women and children on armed, begging for mercy, shot, stabbed, blown up, raped, tortured, killed, murdered,

Speaker 1:          00:07:21       and no, I don't like talking about this is specially when it's Americans that are committing the sin. When we talk about the Nazis in Germany and we've talk about the Chechens and garage need, we talk about the Japanese Shinto in the, in the Malaysian jungle on the Hutus in Rwanda. I don't like that, but this is us.

Speaker 2:          00:07:55       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:07:56       still the question comes, it came into my mind. Do I do this? Do I talk about this? Can I talk about this in the bottom line is not can I, but we have to. We have to cover this. We have to talk about it. We can't ignore it. We can't deny it. We have to take ownership of it to admit it, to air it out and to keep it in the front of our minds to ensure that we do everything we can to make sure nothing like this ever happens again. War is hell and me lie is the ninth circle of hell, the part, and let's go there to make sure we remember and start by looking at the path that led there

Speaker 1:          00:09:13       and in order to look at the path that led there or we're going to start just by a little bit of broad strategy because there's plenty of blame to go around. And when you look at the broad strategy in the way it was laid out, here's a little piece on general Westmoreland who was running, running the strategy in Vietnam. General Westmoreland strategy of attrition also had an important effect on our behavior. Our mission was not to win. Terrain receives positions, positions, but simply to kill. To kill Communist and kill as many of them as possible. Stack them up like cordwood victory was a high body count. Defeat a low kill ratio wore a matter of arithmetic. The pressure on unit commanders to produce as many corpses was intense and they in turn communicated it to their troops. It's not surprising, therefore that some men acquired a contempt for human life and a predilection for taking it.

Speaker 2:          00:10:19       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:10:19       so that that's, that's the, that's the environment that you're in, the environment you're in, that's being encouraged to kill, kill as many as possible. That's coming from the top. That's the broad strategy not to win this hill. It's kill and who you talking to and who's receiving this. Here's a little, a little piece on Charlie Company, which is the army unit that this is based on and that that committed this atrocity. We were kids 1819 years old. I was 21 years old at the time. I was one of the oldest people around there among the common grunts. Most of them had never been away from home before. They went into service and they ended up in Vietnam. Many of them because they thought they were going to do something courageous on behalf of their country.

Speaker 1:          00:11:12       So young kids and, and nowadays, if you're young kid, you're 1314 1618 you know, guess what? You might not have traveled around the world, but you've seen the world because you have television, you have the Internet, you can see all these parts of the world. You can see all different cultures and people. Well, when you're from Iowa in 1967 you, you, you, you don't know anything about this. So you're getting, next thing you know, six months later you're in Vietnam and here's a little bit of where you're going to get your attitude from back to the book to the troops of Charlie company. Two American troops in general, all Vietnamese were goofs, dinks, dopes and slopes. Soldiers who could not find the Vietnamese who were their enemy soon struck out. Why aren't we at the Vietnamese who were supposed to be their friends? How can you tell the enemy? Varnado Simpson said they all look the same to which another meal I veteran added in the end. Everyone in that country was the enemy. In all wars. It is common for the enemy to be dehumanized. But in Vietnam, American soldiers also dehumanize their allies. Charlie company had not been in Vietnam long before the pattern of brutality leading to me. Lie began their own losses and injuries hastened the process. Hatred, fear, racism and revenge turned to beatings, torture, rape, murder. All of these offenses were committed with impunity by individuals and groups from Charlie company. And the weeks before the massacre finally at me, Eli, they discovered that having dehumanize the Vietnamese, they had also dehumanized themselves.

Speaker 2:          00:13:08       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:13:09       so you're going to see this escalation. And it's just like we talked about with the, with the Russian soldiers in Chechnya and how it starts when they don't shave. Yeah. And then they don't clean their weapon and they don't stand watch. And then the next thing you know, they're not doing their duty and they're being overrun. You're going to see a similar escalation here all around lack of discipline. But it's in a way that they treat the local populous. And you know, I had one of my high school teachers was a, was a Vietnam veteran and when I was going to high school, the movie platoon came out and, and you can tell, actually you can tell that the movie platoon, the La, the book we did platoon leader by Jim Mcdonough, there's so many scenes in that book that you can tell all of the north read that book and put some of those scenes in the movie.

Speaker 1:          00:14:01       There's no doubt about it because even a character named Barnes in the, in the book and in the movie well platoon also showed, you know, a very high, it portrayed the Americans in a very rough light in many of the situations. And when I talked to my, one of my teachers in high school that wasn't, was a Vietnam vet. And he just said, you know, the thing that they didn't show very well because they show the guys coming in and in really beaten people, killing people, burning villages. And what he said was, you know, Jocko wheat, we would walk around the village and one of our guys would hit a booby trap. Every day, every other day, and the villagers are out there walking on the same trails, but they're not getting blown up. And after

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       weeks and then months of this happening of me losing two guys, three guys, six guys getting blown up, getting killed, losing their legs, losing their arms, losing their lives, and the Vietnamese villagers, they're not hitting anything. Eventually in in our minds, they become guilty.

Speaker 4:          00:15:11       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          00:15:13       Now, when you have leadership that can explain and restrain and control, you can keep that stuff controlled, but when you have leadership that buys into that attitude, you end up in a very bad situation, which is where we're heading here in Ely.

Speaker 4:          00:15:31       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          00:15:36       Now, back to the strategy. The aim of American strategy was simple to kill Vietcong in such large numbers that they would not be replaced or could not be replaced, but how was this to be achieved without at the same time killing large numbers of civilians? This was a problem to which no one on the American side ever discovered a satisfactory answer. It was the biggest failure of the war. It was a failure magnified enormously by American strategic thinking. For Westmoreland. Vietnam was a war of attrition, a meat grinder, as they called it in the Pentagon. The object he explained was to bleed the north to waken in the communist mind the notion that they were draining their population to the point of national disaster for generations to come to achieve this goal and to win a war in a war of attrition, Americans had to kill Vietcong fighters faster than the communists could replace them as befits a great industrial power. The war was to be fought on an industrial scale, Westmoreland like patent before him intended to construct a killing machine. So for noble as to be irresistible, it's sheer size and power would pay rise the enemy in this submission.

Speaker 3:          00:16:53       So there you go. Once again, it's very clear what the goal is from a strategic level. Kill as many as you can.

Speaker 4:          00:17:04       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:17:04       and this, this kind of spells out how determined they were to do that. Back to the book from the beginning of American involvement involvement. It'd become common practice for patrols to call for artillery or narrow strike if they received even sniper fire from a village, irrespective of whether civilians also sheltered there. By the end of 1966 fighter bombers were making up to 400 such stories a day added to be 52 raids in the country. This meant that around 825 tons of bombs were delivered every day a figure that doubled by the tonnage of high explosive fired by fired off by artillery. The solution in Vietnam, general debris told the visiting emissary from the Pentagon is more bombs, more shells, more napalm till the other side cracks and gives up, and that's what they got in 1967 and article in life magazine claim that the cost of killing a single Vietcong guerrilla was $400,000 which included the cost of 75 bombs in 150 artillery shells. No nation in history had waged a war with such little regard to expense. Only days before me, Eli, Robert Mcnamara, this retiring secretary of defense would remind an audience gathered to record his farewell from the Pentagon. That more bombs had been dropped on Vietnam. Then on the whole of Europe during the whole of World War Two

Speaker 3:          00:18:39       so that's just, that's crazy. Especially for me from my perspective, having, having been in the war in Iraq and having known guys that fought in Afghanistan, the this idea that they take sniper fire from a village and in calling air strikes on the village is just something that would not happen. Then you're, that's why when people, when people frame America as being this, this power that just goes and crushes and kills all these civilians, I know for a fact it's not true. Yes, obviously it happened in Vietnam, but we go through great lengths almost sometimes. I'm telling you almost sometimes absurd lengths to protect the civilian populace in Iraq and Afghanistan. I could bring, I could bring so many people on here, on this program, just, just seals. But I could bring any, anybody from all kinds of diff, every branch of the military to come here and say, Oh yeah, here's what we, here's the situation. My guys were pinned down under fire. We tried to get bombs dropped on this building. No one would do it. We couldn't do it. We weren't allowed to do it. Yeah. And, and that's, that's the reality today. And you know, part of that is we've matured as a nation. Obviously we see there that that's a problem. I mean, I'm not incur. This is the way we should fight. You know, sometimes we go too far in one direction. This was obviously too far in the other direction.

Speaker 5:          00:19:55       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:19:59       in, in Iraq.

Speaker 3:          00:20:03       I remember you mentioned something about the, the, um, the enemy in Iraq would use the civilian populace. Oh, there's no doubt about it. For like shields. And they literally used used kids as shields. They knew our rules of engagement. They knew that if they stayed in buildings that were close to a mosque or work close to a hospital, that we wouldn't bomb it, that we wouldn't hit it with with armor. So they were very smart about how they took advantage of our rules of engagement and then we had to adjust our tactics. So there there's no doubt the enemy figures out what your rules of engagement are and then they start to press you in the seams of that rules of engagement is try and take advantage of it to the best of their ability. Do you think that that that's kind of an indicator that they

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       cared about their civilians less than you cared about their activity, that that is 100% accurate? Of course. I mean the, the Al Qaeda and surgeons and now the Isis in Iraq, they don't care about civilian casualties at all. They don't care. They literally don't care their own their own. Well, that's crazy. Yeah. In the civilians, okay. This is something that never gets portrayed correctly. The civilians don't want isis in charge. The civilians didn't want outside in charge. They knew what that would lead to. And yeah, al Qaeda would use their children as shields. I mean I literally had snipers of mine that shot al Qaeda guys carrying machine guns in one hand and a baby and the other hand. And luckily we had really good snipers. Yeah. So

Speaker 1:          00:21:44       back to the book here, we get to talk a little bit about the company. The company that this is about Charlie company and a company is the company soldiers generally around 150 people and you'll have three. Generally you'll have three platoons in there. So your platoons are going to be 40, 50, maybe 60 people. Sometimes it's, it's actually a lot more flexible than people realize. Sometimes in already army company we'll have five platoons but generally three platoons. What they'll have. So you know, we're talking here probably about 150 guys in Charlie Company and they're guys they lay out that kind of go into a quick background of the different guys. And really what it ends up showing you is a, is a cross section of America. Uh, some, some highlights, you know, they got a guy named Fred Fred Whitmere from just north of Pittsburgh. You got a guy named Kenneth Hodges from Dublin, Georgia.

Speaker 1:          00:22:38       Um, uh, farmer's boy. You got a guy from Portland, Oregon named Greg Olsen, who's, who's a Mormon, a devout Mormon and, and you know from a good family, you got another guy named Harry Stanley from Gulf Port Mississippi who was brought up by his mom who believed in hard work school and Church on Sundays. So you're looking at a fairly normal cross section. Michael Bernhardt came from a middle class Catholic family from Long Island, so he got just the, the troops are just a cross section and then you get to one of the leaders in Charlie company in charge of second platoon and his name was William laws, Cali lieutenant Calley

Speaker 1:          00:23:30       and he's going to end up being are the monster year. So back to the book, who was Kelly in the early seventies a small industry grew up trying to find the answer toilers at this looked for a monster, but all they found was a nonentity, a blend young man burdened. It seemed with as much ordinariness as any single individual could bear and almost too much of a conventional and commonplace to retain what is necessary for human identity. To press [inaudible] to the press, Kelly was just about as average in American as ever came out of the nondescript middleclass streets of Miami. He could be any young American. He was the quiet American. It was noted with astonishment that he emerged from a background which most would regard as coming close to the American ideal. Elsewhere, it was said that his life could have been lifted from the cover drawing of the old Saturday evening post is averageness had made him so invisible at one college he attended that all anyone could remember about him was that he paid his rent regularly. The many who combed through his life found no shred of deviance, nor even a single distinctive feature other than his height. Five, four, five feet, four inches. He'd come from a stable family. He'd been neither particularly popular or unpopular. He had no particular talents and few, if any, enthusiasms, water skiing was the closest he ever got to violence throughout a long education. He'd shown no aptitude for learning. His college career simply fizzled out

Speaker 1:          00:25:21       and that's one of the things, I mean you can see this guy just is a white your blank White Brett of just plain, just plain and that's what they find about them

Speaker 1:          00:25:33       now of a company itself. They say back to the book Charlie company was very average, so so Charlie company actually reflects Cali and the fact that Charlie company as a whole is pretty normal for a company of army soldiers in Vietnam and investigation ordered by the army chief of staff in 1970 re revealed that 87% of Charlie company's ncrs or high school graduates nearly 20% above the army's norm. Most of the men in Charlie Company were between 18 and 22 years old. Nearly half the company was black. The piers report concluded that there was little to distinguish Charlie company from other rifle companies. The men were generally representative of the typical cross section of American youth assigned to most combat units throughout the army. They brought with them the diverse traits, prejudices and attitudes, typical of the various regions of the country and segments of society from whence they came.

Speaker 4:          00:26:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:27       Normal people. And why it's important to remember that as we dive into this and as this story develops, you're going to see these normal people do completely demonic things. And now we talk a little bit here about there in Hawaii and they're going through some training to prepare them for Vietnam.

Speaker 1:          00:26:59       Back to the book, what most Charlie Company veterans remember about the training was its unreality and how little it prepared them for what they had to face in Vietnam. For Fred Woodmere, it seemed they had been preparing for World War II or Korea. Calli thought they could go to Vietnam and be Audie Murphy's kicking the door, running the hooch, give it a good burst kill. Bernado Simpson said you can't have no type of training. Can compare with what war's like none. There's no such thing as preparedness for war. We trained and we should, we're so psyched up and they program you to kill and to go to Vietnam, you know? But once you get there, it's a different situation.

Speaker 1:          00:27:48       Now. I spent my last three years in the military training guys for Warren. I have, I'll tell you right now, we train guys really well for war and the training that I received preparing for war did a great job and we improved upon that. The more combat experience we got, the better we got at training and preparing guys for war. But you can see how you could you, you know how important the training is and the training has got to be realistic to the situations you're going to be put in. And clearly, you know they them saying that this was like World War II or Korea. Well in World War II, Korea, there's vast differences between what you're dealing with Vietnam. I mean World War II or Korea, you're fighting against the enemy. Uniformed troops that are on the other side of a line that are attacking you, right? That's what, that's what world war two and Korea was very much like for the most part, another person in a different uniform that you aren't going to fight and kill and here we just have something totally different.

Speaker 1:          00:28:47       People that are mixed in with the villages, there's no fee. There's no front line anywhere. They're dressing the same. Sometimes they have a gun, sometimes they don't. It's, it's an infinitely challenging, more, more challenging situation. Now here we go back to the book. According to Cali, the only lesson every GI learned was not to trust anybody. It was drummed into us. Be Sharp on guard. As soon as you think these people won't kill you, zap in combat, you haven't friends, you have enemies. Over and over again at ocs we heard this and I told myself, I'll act as if I'm never secure as if everyone in Vietnam would do me in as if everyone is bad.

Speaker 4:          00:29:34       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:29:35       Michael Bernhardt was also concerned. Charlie company did not match up to the high standards that have order and discipline. He had learned at the Lasalle military academy. So this is one of the soldiers. He had gone to a, uh, a military type high school where they had good discipline and they learned about the military. And then when he got in he went to airborne school. So he was more the higher end soldier back to the book, trained as a parachute, as he was disappointed to have been transferred to a run of the mill infantry company. Bernhardt was unusual for an enlisted man. He was a military animal, a stickler for authority, and was happiest when things were being done by the book. But it was not this system that bar bothered Bernhardt. He believed that good soldiers not only needed discipline, but liked it. It was the lax discipline in Charlie company. And the fact that officers did not always insist on their orders being carried are out that worried him in an argument with Kelly. Shortly after arriving in Hawaii, he found the young lieutenant callow and lacking in leadership qualities. So right now we're already seeing some, some chinks in the armor of lieutenant Calley. And if you remember what Hackworth said about, about me, Eli, he talked about Kelly and he said that Kelly had been

Speaker 2:          00:31:02       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:31:03       kicked out or failed. He'd failed officer candidate school three times and they just wanted to, hey, we need more guys. We need to have better numbers getting through. Go ahead and pass the guy. So you've got a guy that lacks leadership and it is, I mean it's interesting the talk about how bland this guy is. I mean somebody that's that bland that they literally have nothing, no characteristics. Obviously the guy lacked some leadership characteristics as well because he has no characteristics and now you've got the young soldiers looking at the guy and thinking he doesn't have, he doesn't have any leadership. And this is a, this is a part that I highlighted because I think it's, it's an interesting perspective of what it was like to go to Vietnam. Back to the book, we flew over on a Kent Continental Airlines plane, Fred Whitmere recalls. It was a weird situation, a civilian plane with a civilian stewardess and crew. They were flying both ways. They were flying people out as well as in, so they got to see both ends. I remember getting off the plane and the stewardess just stood there crying. As we unloaded, they were more attuned to what we were getting into than we were.

Speaker 1:          00:32:18       That's pretty surreal.

Speaker 2:          00:32:22       Now

Speaker 1:          00:32:26       they start talking about what it's like there and what they're doing and there's a, there's a province, they're that they, they're to concentrate on

Speaker 3:          00:32:39       a province in Vietnam and some of the problems that they have there in a province deemed correctly to be overwhelmingly sympathetic to Vietcong. This meant eliminating the countryside. The villages were bombed, burned down and pull verist. Sometimes villagers would be warned in advance that their homes were about to be wiped off the face of the earth, sometimes not. It was common practice to shell or bomb any village from which the US soldiers had taken any fire, even small arms without any warning at all. The destruction was on an almost unimaginable scale. So again, is this something that in the wars that I fought in, that we would, this is on we, we would never do that. It wasn't just like, oh, we took rifle fire from a village bomb. The whole thing that was not happening.

Speaker 3:          00:33:29       This was the reality behind Westmoreland's prediction in 1965 that the war will bring about a moment of decision for the peasant farmer. He will have to choose if he stays alive. American officials frequently referred to this choice. The choice is yours. One leaflet dropped on villages proclaimed. If you refuse to let Vietcong use your villages and hamlets as their battlefield, your homes and lives will be spared. 1 million leaflets, leaflets a day were being dropped on quieting province [inaudible] province at this time. The whole exercise assumed that the largely illiterate peasants could actually read them from 1965 to 1970 to 50 billion leaflets were dropped over Vietnam, 1500 each for every member of the population. So that's just w when you think about we're dropping these leaflets to tell the people what to do and, and most of the popular, a lot of the population is illiterate. Hey, get out of your village. Well, there's a piece of paper flying from the sky and I don't know what it says.

Speaker 2:          00:34:37       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:34:41       Back to the book to stay and be killed or to go join thousands of other refugees in the squalor of refugee camps or the mushrooming shanty towns around the towns and cities. What kind of a choice was this?

Speaker 3:          00:34:54       But for the Americans, the whole point of clearing an area of countryside of its people was so that anyone who remained must be Viet Cong. These areas became free fire zones. Anything that happened to someone who chose to remain in or return to a free fire zone was their own fault. They could expect the worst. The belief that people had been given a chance to get out, had made their choice, made the strategy morally workable in a free fire zone. The pursuit of a high body count could proceed unencumbered by the need to discriminate between combatants and civilians at all. Nowhere was this Brit breathtaking carelessness of human life greater than in night. No one was actually saying kill civilians, but no one's strive to keep them alive because the killing of civilians came to be seen as unavoidable. Less and less time was spent on seeing how it could be avoided to American spokesman, the death or injury of noncombatants who was always accidental and inevitable tragedy of war and therefore somehow uncorrectable

Speaker 3:          00:36:14       me. What do you eat? You do. It doesn't take a genius to figure this out. When did the Americans are bombing your village and they're killing your, your son, your husband, your wife, whatever. I mean at what, whose side are you going to be on? You know, it's, and we know, we know that the VC were brutal. We'll look at the end of platoon commander when the VC come in and murder the half the village or three quarters the village and burned down their huts and blow up all their, all their hooches. We know that the VC, you were capable and and evil, but when our strategy is, hey, give him a quick warning, drop some leaflets, tell them if they stay there, they're VC. And if not, hey, we gave him a chance. So if they're standing there, there must be VC.

Speaker 4:          00:36:59       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          00:37:03       Charlie company's spent December guarding bridges and practicing in the deserted village of Duke foe. The army called it in country orientation and Australian advisor was brought into instruct the company on how to distinguish between noncombatants, Viet Cong, regular suspects and sympathizers. He said it was very difficult. So did other instructors from the South Vietnamese army, they got the same story from former Viet Cong. The Australian emphasize that you should be extremely leery of children. Medina testified later in Medina is the company commander. So the company has three platoons in it, the overall in charge of the company's guy named Medina. Now think about this, not only, you're just distinguishing between good and bad. You got noncombatants, which are, you know, friendly civilians, Vietcong, regulars, suspects and sympathizers. And now you've got the Vietnamese soldiers who are from Vietnam. Obviously they're saying how hard it is to distinguish who's who. And then the Viet Cong, the captured Viet cong themselves are saying that it's very difficult to know who's who. So how is a kid from Iowa going to be able to tell the difference? We will expose to something that went far beyond the world. As we knew it said Fred Whitmere. We had just left Hawaii with all its hotels

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       and nightclubs and bars and we wound up in Vietnam where people went right out and shit and the rice patty in the morning drop their drawers right along the trail at any time. It was hard to consider people in the modern day and age living like they did. I think it would against our value of what human life is.

Speaker 1:          00:38:57       Kelly was always frustrated in his attempts to keep the children away from his men when they were guarding bridges at duck foe, all the men love them, gave the kits, candies, cookies, chewing gum, everything he said later, not me, I hated them. I was afraid of the Vietnamese kids. So you know, you've got the Australian guy saying, hey, look, be leery of the kids. You got the kid from Iowa, the normal American grunt. He loves the kids, he's good and he's giving them gum. He's giving them food, playing with them. It's all good. Meanwhile, Cali, again, you start seeing the indicators of what's about to take place. You got a guy that's saying I hated them, I hated them. It's hard to develop hatred for it. For a kid, for a five year old.

Speaker 5:          00:39:45       Nope.

Speaker 1:          00:39:51       Now they, they become part of a, a unit that's called Task Force Barker, which is a multiple companies of which Charlie companies, one of them. And, and this lieutenant colonel, look, battalion commander, he is the, he is the commander of this task force and they actually, his name is Colonel Frank Barker. So they named the task force after him and they send them up to this, to this province. Now inside there, back to the book, inside their fire bases, men of 10 men of the task force enjoyed as much of the American world as could be flown in by helicopter. They received their mail, American newspapers, Cold Beers, steaks, ice cream, Coca Cola and playboy magazine. But all around them was the world of the Viet Cong. And I got another, uh, another interesting thing from this book just to, just to show the extent that they, that they did this, there's, there was 40 ice cream plants built in Vietnam to supply the troops with ice cream, the and, and each Bu. Another figure that I read was that each, each person in each soldier in Vietnam used uh, a hundred pounds of supplies at day. Crazy.

Speaker 5:          00:41:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:20       Now the guys, they move into this new projects, province Quain NY and they start to encounter some combat

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       and I'm very careful to say they're not encountering, they're not really encountering VC, they're not getting an a bunch of firefights but they are getting in some and this is there, they're in their first fire fight in here. We go back to the book of the men in their first firefight. We're discovering things about each other and about themselves. Greg Olson recalled we were pinned down in a trench taking a lot of fire. Sergeant Cowan was on one side, one side of me putting up his helmet to get some bullet holes in it. Almost like it was a music on the other side. There was this other guy just sobbing. He'd come on, glued, crawling around like a dog. Just lost it.

Speaker 3:          00:42:14       The first platoon withdrew under cover of massive artillery bombardment. According to some of the men, Kelly was totally lost. He led them back towards the river. As they broke cover, the snipers started up again. Ron Weber Kelly's radio operator took a shot, which shattered his radio set and tore his kidney out. He died a few moments later. Charlie company's first killed in action. His horrified companions lifted him onto the Hovering Med evac helicopter, a Gi and shock blubbered and how old, no one had known much about shock before. If we got hit much harder, we would all go into shock. Cali told his count, his court martial nearly three years later. It was terrifying, a terrifying experience. In later years, Kelly admitted that he'd been careless. He led his men into an exposed position, so they're in a firefight and they're trying to break contact and Cali leads a mountain to an open area and gets one of his guys killed. And then he asked to report back. He got in a firefight. Okay, look, how'd it go? Let's report back. What's the body count? Cause that, remember this is all about killing is all about killing. Yeah, and so he passes up the body count and here's how he comes up with his body count.

Speaker 3:          00:43:36       Ask later how he arrived at a body count. Kelly had replied, you just make an estimate off the top of your head. There is no way to really figure out exact body count. As long as it was high, that's all they wanted. I generally knew that if I lost a troop, I better come back with a body count of 10 say I shot at least 10 of the enemy, which was pretty hard when you're only fighting one sniper, so you've got these guys out in the field and they're reporting, they're just making up the body count. Now think about what, how the what the effect is house on the war effort because General Westmoreland's up there saying, hey, we're going to kill them until they can't take it anymore. Well guess how many people they killed, right there is zero. They didn't kill that sniper and yet they're reporting that they killed 10 well, you multiply that over the whole country and every unit that's out there that's making up these body count numbers and guess what? Eventually Westmoreland thinks we're doing a good job and killing a lot of bad guys, but we're not killing nanny.

Speaker 4:          00:44:35       Yup.

Speaker 3:          00:44:37       Yeah. And that can jam you up when you have that like you in a different type of scenario where you're getting reports on a certain level of progress and therefore a lot of times the decision, the next decisions to be made are based on that oh 100% 80 any situation that you're in, if you've got your troopers and your subordinate leadership with a mindset that they would rather lie to you, then tell you the truth about what's happening. You're not, you're never gonna be able to make good decisions because you're making your decisions based on lies. Yup.

Speaker 4:          00:45:07       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:45:13       Back to the book, frustration and anger ate away at the company's a spree decor. The men stopped believing that Charlie Kong, meaning the Vietcong, was afraid of Charlie company faith in Medina, the company commander was still high, although some Gis felt he pushed the company to hard. Cali was another matter. Opinion on him was universally hostile according to one GI and his platoon Kelly was a glory hungry person. The kind of person who would have sacrificed all of us for his own personal advancement. John Smale, our squad leader in third platoon called him a nervous, excitable type who yelled a lot. I think it's important for you to know, smelled talk told the army cid that Cali was so disliked by members of the unit that they put a bounty on his head. None of the men had any respect for him as a military leader. Greg Olson thought he was incompetent. I remember instances that we were lost one time at night. Everyone knew we were lost, but Calli wouldn't admit it. So there you go. You got a guy, we talk about this all the time. It's like, oh, what do you do if you make a mistake, you own the mistake. If you need help, you say, Hey, you know what? I'm not sure we were on the map right now. Let me get, let me get someone up here and do a map study helped me out. Let's figure out where we are, but instead he just lies. He doesn't admit it, he doesn't own it, and no one is going to have respect for them.

Speaker 3:          00:46:40       Back to the book, someone else thought Kelly acted like a small guy who had been pushed around a lot by bigger people before he joined the army. Now that he had a 40 he didn't know how to use it and he didn't listen to suggestions. We, I talk about this all the time. If you're in a leadership position, you need to listen to your people up and down the chain of command. This is one of the main thing that he's getting called out on it, doesn't it? But when he's wrong and doesn't listen to suggestions, many commented that there was something about him that rubbed people the wrong way. Medina, the company commander gave his junior lieutenant a tough time and ridiculed him in front of his men.

Speaker 3:          00:47:20       The captain called him lieutenant shithead regularly. One Gi remembered that tended to minimize your opinion of him are get recalled. Others recalled that Kelly's attempt to win flavor with Medina were frequently rebuffed with a sarcastic listen sweetheart. So now we have another situation where you have a subordinate leader that's not doing a good job. He's not being a good leader. People don't respect him and what his, what is his superior, don't undermining them in front of his troops instead of counseling. And instead of helping them set up, pulling them aside and say, hey, it's okay to admit when you're wrong. Hey, you need to take suggestions from your guys'. Instead he's calling them a shithead lieutenant shithead undermining him all the time. So now you got, you get put in Cali need even worse position.

Speaker 5:          00:48:04       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          00:48:09       Now they continue to patrol. They're starting to take some casualties and they start to go down the spiral.

Speaker 5:          00:48:19       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:48:20       Back to the book. Charlie company's drift toward brutality. Took very little time. It began with beating up suspects in villages and quickly became more serious. Bernhardt state aloof from the process. Fred Woodmere did not. They had explained that Geneva Convention to us during our training and in the beginning we did what we thought was right and just turn a prisoners over. But it was kind of hard after you'd been there a while and you started seeing learning, finding out what real experience is all about. Here you are fighting an enemy who doesn't follow the Geneva Convention, but you have to abide by it. It's like being at a football team where you don't, where you have to follow the rules to the letter and the other team can do whatever the hell they like. The voices of authority in the company, the platoon sergeants and officers acknowledged that this executing prisoners was a proper way to behave. Who were the grunts to disagree with it? We supported it. So they've started to execute prisoners, which is obviously against the Geneva Convention, but the way they're looking at it, they're seeing that the sergeants and the, and the platoon commanders are like, okay with it. So the grunts, okay, I guess that's the way it's going to be.

Speaker 5:          00:49:37       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          00:49:39       And we'd mirror goes on to say the first time I saw something really bad was the point at which we stopped taking prisoners. We'd been there about a month and a half or maybe two months. There was one guy, Medina had shoot the prisoners. Instead of having everyone around and shoot them, we would walk them down towards the, they would walk them down towards the beach or behind some sand dunes and shoot them a couple of shots and they were done. As time went by, things were done, ears cut off, mutilation. One prisoner had his arms tied straight out on a stick. One woman was, one was a woman and one was a man. There was no question that these two were Vietcong. The woman was working as a nurse and we found them in a tunnel with all the medical supplies and we knew they were the enemy.

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       Lit cigarettes were put inside the elastic of the guy's pants and we watched him dance around because they were burning his ass.

Speaker 5:          00:50:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:38       I think it was a bit of making him talk in a bit of venting our frustrations. A bit of both. I don't remember what happened to them, whether they were turned over or shot. The more it went on, the more you didn't trust anyone. You didn't believe anybody because you didn't know who was who. You didn't know who the enemy was as we went on.

Speaker 5:          00:51:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:00       More and more prisoners. Prisoners would be executed. I would say it was a regular occurrence. I did abuse someone, a prisoner, a Papasan. I found myself doing the same things that had been going on all along. I found myself caught up in it. We caught his beard off. That was an insult. A Papasan with a beard is considered as the wise man had to cut off their beard was a real sign of disrespect to them. You found yourself punching them around, beating them up, trying to get them to talk. I never did hit anyone with a rifle.

Speaker 1:          00:51:33       I've taken a knife to them. I never tortured anyone to death. I think I probably saw people tortured to death. So you hear this guy using this verbiage, you find yourself punching them around. It's almost as if it's not, it's not him. He's detailed. He's like detached. Yup. Right. We talk about being detached. Well, he's detached from doing something that he knows he shouldn't be doing. Yeah. It seems like he comes back and kind of checks back in every once in awhile. It's like, Dang. I kind of woke up and found myself doing this thing. Bernhardt and outsider as usual, watch the downward spiral. It started with just plain prisoners. Prisoners you thought were the enemy. Then you'd go onto prisoners who weren't the enemy and then the civilians because there was no difference between the enemy and civilians. It came to a point where a guy could kill anybody

Speaker 1:          00:52:24       during an interrogation. In one village, here we Stanley was standing only 10 feet away while the Cali and another Gi Herbert Carter interrogated and old farmer. Lieutenant Calley asked some questions and then Carter hit the old man in the mouth twice with his fist. Then Carter push the old man into a well, but the old man spread his legs and arms and held on and didn't fall into the well. Then Carter hit the old man in the stomach with his rifle stock. The old man fell. The old man's feet fell into the well, but he was holding on with his hands. Carter hit demands fingers trying to make him fall into the well. Then lieutenant Calley shot the man with Zim. 16

Speaker 1:          00:53:07       for some Gis instance like these showed that the official attitude to brutality was permissive. What resulted was a moral vacuum, a moratorium on restraint and self control. Common decency became optional. A matter of personal inclination even who refuse to be drawn in were left, left Morley, thrown off balance. Greg Olson was in the village when Crowley and Carter through the old man down the well, I was in the village. I remember seeing people butted in the head with rifles, but you start losing your sense of what's normal. You don't give up your morals, but you become a lot more tolerant. We believe this behavior was pretty common place. I didn't think we were doing anything different from any other unit. You really do lose your sense not of right and wrong, but your degree of white right and wrong

Speaker 1:          00:54:02       and Michael Bernhardt who watched what was happening from the sidelines was already viewed with some mistrust by Medina Kelly and others in the company. When I saw American soldiers committing acts that could be called atrocities if someone else had done them. I began to think that maybe I just been too naive all my life, that this is the way things really were. Little by little, I began to see that this group of men was getting out of control. Discipline was beginning to wear off without military discipline. They were alone in the country with no point of reference. The things they had brought from their families and schools were far away and beginning to disappear.

Speaker 1:          00:54:44       Fred, Weird Mirror felt Fred Woodmere to felt things going from bad to worse and felt himself drawn along with the tide. If it ever occurred to me that things were getting out of hand or that I was questioning what I myself might be capable of doing, I suppressed it. It did creep up in my mind because you still have those values of what is right and what is wrong that you have been taught all your life. I think the frustration got to me, but I also think I began to enjoy it. That's what's scary because at the time you find yourself enjoying it. I guess you could term it this superiority we had over them. It's a strange feeling. In retrospect. You look back on it and wonder how you yourself could have done it 20 years later. When you look back at things that happened, things that transpired, things you did. You say, why? Why did I do that? That is not me. Something happened to me. You reach a point over there where you snap. That's the easiest way to put it. You finally snap. Somebody flicks a switch and you are completely different person.

Speaker 1:          00:55:53       There's a culture of violence, of brutality with people all around you doing the same thing. Continuing down the spiral. Leonard to Gonzales, a member of second platoon SAR rapes committed. Every time the company went through a village,

Speaker 4:          00:56:18       okay, one

Speaker 1:          00:56:19       squad got one girl, one lady. Then they told me, go

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       in there and I said, no I won't. So what I did is I went inside and she looked real bad. The only thing I can do for the lady is like, I got the canteen and I wiped her. She was awful for spiring. I wiped her forehead. I tried to help her. She got scared of me. I was part of them. I tried to tell her I don't have nothing to do with it. I helped her to her feet. I took her to the, well, I got some water from the well. Then another squad heard about 13 guys who did their thing with this woman and we're going to try her out. And I told them to leave her alone. And then at that time I just walked off. I said, forget it. I don't want to kill my own men. I tried to tell her, get out of here. Go. She was going to run. But after 13 guys got to her, it's hard to walk. They're losing it. There's no leadership. They're losing it.

Speaker 3:          00:57:39       Now the get into a, they get, they get in a minefield and they take some casualties into mind field and here's Medina's account of what happened in this mine field. We started sweeping the area as best we could with mine detectors, taking pieces of toilet paper and marking the minds that we found. We had one individual that we could not evacuate that was dead. I took the medic that was with me, the platoon medic from first platoon and he and I moved to the minefield to where an individual was lying. He was split as if somebody had taken a cleaver and write up from his crotch all the way up to his chest cavity. I had never seen anything like it. That looks so unreal in my entire life. The intestines, the liver, and the stomach and the blood just looked like plastic. We took a Poncho and we spread it out and started and the and the medic started to pick them up by the legs.

Speaker 3:          00:58:35       I reached underneath his arms to place him under the Poncho and we set them on top of another mine. The concussion blew me back. I fell backward. As I got up the martyr, the medic was starting to go to pieces. I looked at him as if he had stood behind the screen and somebody had taken a paintbrush with red paint and splattered it through the screen. He had blood all over him. I grabbed him as he started to pass me and I shook him and I said, my God, don't go to pieces on me. You're the only medic I've got. I have these people that are hurt. I hit him. I slapped him. I knocked him to the ground and I helped him to get back up and I saw on his religious metal a piece of liver and I tried to get it off the individual

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       before he seen it. The individual was very shook up.

Speaker 4:          00:59:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:59:28       Everybody was shaking. The three men were dead. Another 12 suffered ghastly injuries. Few could forget their own fear or the screams of the wounded or the gruesome task of loading the medivac helicopters. When you've been through a minefield and put the remains of your friends in body bags, nothing shocks you anymore. So that mind field costs some three dead and 12 severely wounded in, we talk about [inaudible] a lot in here. We talked about them with Jodi, Jodi medic who got blown up by an IED. There's no, there's no one to fight. The bomb goes off in. That's it. Well, who did this? Who Do you blame? Well, let me answer that question for these guys. Most of all, they blame the Vietnamese, not the Viet Cong who they could not see or find, but the Vietnamese and the villages who did not warn them of the minefields and of the booby traps, same thing my school teacher told me they're starting to apply the blame to these, to these Vietnamese villagers.

Speaker 4:          01:00:40       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:00:44       Lieutenant Calley noticed the change in the mood of the men. He had been on leave at the time of the incident, so he wasn't around when this happened.

Speaker 4:          01:00:55       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:00:56       He'd been on leave at the time of the incident. It had returned the Lz uptight in time to meet the helicopters, fairing the dead and injured from now on. The men in his platoon no longer gave candy to the Vietnamese children. They came across while on patrol in the villages. Instead Cali noticed with some satisfaction they kicked everybody aside. Even the nice sweet kids, he could hardly be refrained from telling them, well I told you so now they are starting to, after that incident they're starting to now assemble information and intelligence for this raid that they're planning in Milano.

Speaker 1:          01:01:48       So, and I think it's really important to take a look to where this intelligence is coming from and how this cause it paints a very important part of the picture of what these guys are being told back to the book and intelligence roundup for March, 1968 prepared respectively summed up the state of knowledge was this, although some 10 district remained relatively quiet during this period, elements of the 48th and existing local force units, probably roned roamed the district countryside, the hills north and northwest of me lie area where probable base camps for elements of the 48th battalion and it probably received supplies from the peninsula. So the 48th is an enemy unit, an enemy, a battalion, and you, you can hear the word probable being used, gave the probably in the area, the villagers probably support them. So there isn't a claim being made from higher from above the chain of command, but you're going to hear that change. So above the chain of command, there's, there's higher intelligence sets making these claims that there's probable VC there that they're probably work in this area that they're probably getting supported from the village as well as this filters down, it turns from probable to like definite.

Speaker 1:          01:03:19       There is a strange discrepancy between what the army thought it knew about the Vietcong and what the task force thought it. New Army intelligence made only tentative claims by contrast Rams Dell and for that matter Qutech we're almost pontifical. So these are the two intelligence guys at the task force level. So does that make sense? So you've got the higher army above them is telling them, hey, there's probably, there's probably that and these guys are, are basically starting to say, no, no, this is VC. This is what the what. This is what's happening factually. Is that Kinda like, like the game of telephone? One of the little, yeah, it is. And it's also, you're gonna find as I go into this at both these guys aren't experienced. Mm. So I'll get to it. There was a kind of perverse destiny that brought the two overweight and middle aged American captains, Ramsdale and Ku talk together in Tet Kwong NY city.

Speaker 1:          01:04:18       Both were new boys to the real world of intelligence assessment in a battle zone. Both were inexperienced, both desperately eager to establish a reputation Ramsdale had provided to intelligence, to Cu tag prior to me lie operation and the curious convergence of their views. Irresistibly suggests that it was indeed Rams Dell who had provided intelligence for the attack on me, lie itself, suggestions at the 48th local force battalion was up to 400 strong that everyone in the village was Viet Cong or Viet cong sympathizer and that at seven on Saturday morning, all bonafide civilians would have left the village for the market. All these views were shared by Remes and Qutech and accepted uncritically by task force barker. So think about that. You got these guys saying there's 400 up to 400 enemy in the area that the village is all Vietcong sympathizers

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       and that on a Saturday, every one that's her actual civilian, we'll have left at seven o'clock in the morning for the market. You can't make that claim about any group of civilians in the world that everyone's going to do something at the same time. Yeah. Impossible that you could do. You could make that claim.

Speaker 4:          01:05:35       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          01:05:38       Back to the book asked later about intelligence indicating that no civilians will be left in the village at the time of the attack. Ramsdale replied that the civilians went to market early in the morning because of the heat.

Speaker 4:          01:05:49       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:05:50       They testified it appears in a similar vein in the civilian market and it's really in population area. There were several markets, large markets where all the people would gather each day because they had no refrigeration or anything like it.

Speaker 3:          01:06:04       With hindsight, it appears naive, even simple minded. Yet in 1968 this nugget of anthropological insight along with the corollary that everyone who is not at the market was Vietcong, was deemed unchallengeable right by Ramsdale, considered impeccable by Qutech and passed on on the amended to the bitter man of Charlie company seeking revenge for their losses. The, this is just a, this is a horrible, it's a horrible situation. And I had, I had situations like that occur with me where it was Earl, my first deployment to Iraq where we got almost like a movie. We would get maps of, of a city area and there'd be a red x on the target building. Yeah, you're bad guys in this building. And I remember one time we went out, we hit the building with a red x on it and we didn't find anything or it was all we all, we all are the people that we got out of there turned out to be not the person we were looking for.

Speaker 3:          01:07:04       And as we did further analysis, we realized that the building was the wrong building in, in after that I got very critical about, okay, who, who put the red x on this building? Tell me who did that and why they did it. I want to know, I'm not just going off of you. Put a red x on a building, doesn't mean anything to me. I want to know who did that. And I had another situation where we went in and hit a building, you know where there were suspected bad guy. We had intelligence on the sky, was a finance a year and had money and was giving it to the insurgence. And so we went and captured him and searched his house and you know, Birla blew his door off. So we, we, we caused impact to his house. And then when we got him back, we, after we talked to him, we figured out this guy was not bad. And as I pulled the string on what, where this intelligence came from, that eventually led somebody to put a red x on his house and describe the guy and who he was. I found out that it was actually he, the guy owned a business and he had fired one of his employees and when he fired one of his employees, well his employee went and told the Americans, hey, this guy's a bad guy. This guy's funding.

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       You know, in search it's got a little disgruntled. So all you had to do is dig in and find a little bit more about the information and you figured out it was a disgruntled employee. So guys out there in the field right now, when you're always questioning your intelligence, nothing against the intelligence folks, they're going to do the best they can, but they're not the ones that are going to get the blood on their hands. So question the intelligence, find out what the sources are, find out where the information came from. Ask who drew that red x. Ask who said there's not going to be any villagers in the, in the no civilians in the village after seven o'clock in the morning. Ask those questions.

Speaker 1:          01:08:53       Meanwhile, the loss is these guys are continued to take casualties. So they took, what was it, three killed and 12 wounded. And now they got Sergeant Cox killed by a booby trap. They got a Dyson lost both legs, Hendrickson's blinded, suffered groin injuries and lost an arm and a leg. So they're continuing to take casualties and on top of the casualties that they're taking, you starting to get an escalation of behavior, of negative behavior. And here's an example of that. Back to the book of village or passing on a bicycle was beaten up but managed to escape. A woman working in the fields was shot when somebody shouted that she was carrying a weapon. When the squad came closer, they discovered she was on armed and still alive. They shot her again and kicked her body to a pulp. Somebody stole her ring. They were now close to their base and angry villagers storm the camp and protest against the murder. Medina managed to hush it up. No one was charged with any offense. Medina said later that the woman had been discovered with a detonator still in her hand. Kelly commented that Medina wasn't about to lose men just because they kicked a Vietnamese kid or kill the damn innocent woman. He had to keep a combat effective unit, so now you've got clear cover up going on by the chain of command. Hey, she had a detonator, she didn't have a detonator

Speaker 1:          01:10:21       and it's very visible to see this downward spiral from a letter from Greg Olson, who like I said, he was the the Faithful Mormon kid and he writes a letter to his dad back in the states. Dear Dad, how's everything with you? I'm still here on the bridge. We leave Saturday. One of our platoons went out on a routine patrol today and came across 155 millimeter artillery round. That was booby trap. It killed one man, blew the legs off to others and injured two more and it all turned out a bad day. Made even worse on their way back to to Dottie, which is there the name of their camp. They saw a woman working in the fields.

Speaker 1:          01:11:07       They shot and wounded her. Then they kicked her to death and empty their magazines in her head. They, every little kid they came across. Why in God's name does this have to happen? These are all seemingly normal guys. Some more friends of mine for a while they were wild like animals. It was murder and I'm ashamed of myself for not trying to do anything about it. This isn't the first time, dad. I've seen it many times before. I don't know why I'm telling you this. I guess I just want to get it all off my chest. My faith and fellow man is all shot to hell. I just want my time to pass and I just want to come home. I really believe as you do dad, there's a cause behind all this and if it is God's will for me to go, I would rather do it here than home on a freeway. Saturday, we're going to be dropped by air in an Nva stronghold. I'm hoping I'll be able to get out of here for a few days to go to a conference. Don't expect any letters from me for awhile, but please keep writing them. I love and miss you and mom so much. Your son Greg.

Speaker 1:          01:12:21       So again highlighted in there the normalicy of the guys and how they're starting to slide the clear. It's obvious to, to Greg Olson that what's happening is wrong. It unfortunately, he's not stepping up and saying anything. He's not bringing it to the attention of anyone. He's letting it happen. Back to the book with these most recent losses, Charlie company was down to 105 men since arriving in Vietnam three months before they had suffered 28 casualties, including five killed, three of them in action. All the casualties, all the casualties come from mines, booby traps and snipers. They had never seen or encountered the enemy in any strength. There had been no heavy contact. They were battle scarred without being battle hardened.

Speaker 1:          01:13:17       So you, you can imagine again, it's what my, what's what my high school teacher told me they're, they're viewing. They're taking these casualty to head. It's very similar to Iraq and Afghanistan where I think in in Iraq it was 75% of the casualties are from ids, so there's no one to shoot at after an IED blows up, oftentimes there's nothing to shoot at. Now with those casualties, with that viewpoint, they're starting to prepare. As I said for this, this assault on me lie in back to the book, although no written record of the briefing survives a witnesses all agree on the general thrust of cu tax contribution. This is the intelligence officer. The 48th LF battalion was dispersed throughout the area, but the latest intelligence, the assemble officers were told,

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       suggested that VC headquarters and two companies totaling over 200 fighting men. We're located in me live for the civilian population population. We're all active sympathizers with the VC. By seven in the morning, most noncombatants would have left the village for the market.

Speaker 3:          01:14:35       So just to make that clear what we're expecting, they're expecting to go in to me lie and find over 200 fighting men and all active sympathizers with the VC. Now they start to ask some questions like, okay, what at the, at the task force level, back to the book, what was to happen to the village itself? Task Force officers left the meeting with the clear impression that Barker had ordered the destruction of all houses, dwellings, and livestock in the meal in the Milwaukee area. Although there is some doubt as to whether this was a direct order or something that had been assumed. Qutech recalled barker saying that the village was to be destroyed. He wanted the area cleaned out, he wanted it neutralized and he wanted the buildings knocked down. He wanted the hooches burned, he wanted the tunnels field and he wanted the livestock and chickens runoff killed or destroyed. He wanted to neutralize the area for Medina. Also. Those were Barker's clear instructions

Speaker 3:          01:15:38       and what was to happen to the civilians. There is nothing to suggest that barker explicitly ordered the murder of ordinary people have me lie, but the previous failures of the task force and the demand for more aggression, the intelligence picture of an community entirely controlled by the Vietcong, the bland assumption that civilians would be gone to the market, the totally unjustified belief that innocent people had been worn to get out of the area. In other words, the entire scorched earth concept of the operation plan to neutralize the area drove irresistibly to the conclusion that here was a free fire zone in which even the people we're to be eliminated.

Speaker 3:          01:16:25       Now that's, so that's the company commanders getting the brief from the battalion commander, from the task force commander. That's the impression that they get. Now we start to get into your Chinese telephone game because now how does that get translated down the chain of command and even with the battalion commander talking to the company commanders, there's, it's not super solid what the actual orders were. It's not a, it's not super solid. No one's said, hey, they said kill women and children. It's kind of implied. Well, maybe he said he wanted everyone destroyed. What does destroyed mean? So now we get to where Medina is talking to his troops and his subordinate leadership. The company. Commander Medina grabbed the shovel from a quarter ton trailer and drew a map of [inaudible] in the dirt at his feet. As he described the coming engagement tomorrow, he told them was Charlie company's chance to get even

Speaker 3:          01:17:24       Medina relayed what he learned at Barker's briefing earlier in the afternoon, the Viet Cong, the 48 Vietcong Battalion were in me lie with the strength of between 250 and 280 so actually he just increased that number cause the, the report that he was given was 200 now he's saying between two 50 and two 80 this meant that Charlie company would be out numbered more than two to one but they were not to worry because helicopter gunships would be on the American side. He told them to expect a hell of a good fight. He told them that all innocent civilians would have gone to the market. He's just amplifying what he was told but what was going to happen to the village.

Speaker 2:          01:18:07       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:18:07       I told them we had permission. Colonel Barker had received permission that the village could be destroyed since it was a VC stronghold to burn down the houses to kill all the livestock, to cut any of the crops that might feed the VC to cave the wells and destroy the village.

Speaker 2:          01:18:24       Okay,

Speaker 3:          01:18:25       and what was going to happen to the innocent civilians? Somebody at debriefing asked him, do we kill women and children? It was an astounding question that speaks volumes about the temper of the men, but the fact that such a question was indeed asked is not disputed. Where testimony is divided is what Medina replied. My reply to that question was, no, you do not kill women and children. You must use common sense. If they have a weapon and are trying to engage you, then you can shoot back, but you must use common sense. But many of the men got a different message. This is sergeant Hodges, right? Recollection of the briefing. This was a time for us to get even a time for us to settle the score, a time for revenge

Speaker 3:          01:19:12       when we can get revenge for our fallen comrades. The order we were given was to kill and destroy everything that was in the village. It was to kill the pigs, dropped them in the wells, pollute the water supply kill, cut down the banana. Trees burned the village burden, the hooches. As we went through it, it was clearly explained that we were, that there were to be no prisoners. That order was given. The order that was given was to kill everyone in the village. Someone asked if that meant that women and children and the order was everyone in the village because those people in that village, the women, the kids, the old men were VC. They were Viet Cong themselves or they were sympathetic to the Vietcong. They were not sympathetic to the American marcons. It was quite clear that no one was to be spared in that village.

Speaker 3:          01:20:05       So pretty clear what sergeant Hodges thought. So Medina says, no, I didn't tell him. I told him you had to use their common sense. If they're shooting at you, then you kill him. Hodges didn't hear that. And back to the book. Sergeant Hodges was not alone. In his interpretation of Medina's briefing, many senior NCO has left the meeting, convinced that the order was to kill everyone. Staff Sergeant Bacon. We were to kill all Viet Cong and all Vietcong sympathizers in the village. Sergeant West. It was a search and destroy mission. We were to kill everything. Staff Sergeant Fagan kill everyone. Sergeant Cowen to kill everything that was in the village enlisted men to glimpse La Martina Gonzales, Lloyd Parsh Moss later testified that this is what they heard. Flint even remembered the question someone asked, are we supposed to kill women and children? And Medina replied, kill everything that moves. Harry Stanley said, Captain Medina told us that the intelligence that established that me lie for was completely enemy controlled.

Speaker 3:          01:21:09       He described the formations we were to use following day and told us to carry extra ammunition. He ordered us to kill everything in the village. The men in my squad talked about amongst ourselves that night because the order to kill everything in the village was so unusual. We all agreed that Captain Medina meant for us to kill every man, woman, and child in the village, but not everyone agreed that Medina had ordered everyone in the village to be killed. Greg Olsen, who's foreboding letter to his father, had been posted only two days before has a completely different recollection of the briefing. There clearly absolutely wasn't an order to go in and slaughter everybody in that village and anybody that says so is a liar. Medina said that any villagers were to be rounded up in airlifted to refugee camps. That was specifically addressed in the meeting. If I thought I was going to get on a helicopter that morning with clear orders that I was going to slaughter every living, breathing human being in that village, I'm sure to God it would have been so appalling and unthinkable. I mean, I'm not that stupid. I know they couldn't have forced me to do something like that.

Speaker 3:          01:22:18       Others two denied. There was any explicit order. It was like Medina's Ben Addiction. Michael Bernhardt said he didn't actually say to kill every man, woman and child in me lie. He stopped. Just short of saying that he gave every other indication that that's what he expected. Whatever Medina actually said, there can be no doubt about the impression he made to get the most of the men to hurt pride. He offered satisfaction to grieving soldiers. He offered a chance to strike back to bitter and resentful men. He offered an end to the frustration. Medina let slip, the dogs of war

Speaker 2:          01:23:05       me

Speaker 1:          01:23:05       lie for was thrown in the path of their vindictiveness and fury. Charlie company was going to get it wrong. It's revenge. The task force would get its body count this time there would be no mistake. So that's where, that's the attitude that these guys roll into the operation with and it is not the right attitude Dav going into the situation because if case you haven't figured this out yet, the village that they're going into, there's no battalion of Viet Cong fighters, there's no fighters at all. And here they start their attack.

Speaker 1:          01:24:06       March 16th, 1968 seven 15 in the morning out in the fields of farmer, frantically raised his hands by way of both greeting and to show he had no weapon. He was immediately filled by a burst from a machine gun along with the gun ships. Almost everyone in first and second platoon's was firing their weapons and now third platoon was joining in the moment of Vietnamese was spotted. Volleys of fire were loosed off and the enemy fell wounded or dying, who is a parent to Bernhardt as it was to virtually everyone gathered there on the ground that they were receiving no return. Fire it all. There was no incoming hold. Came across a hut which had been raped with bullets inside. Burkholder discovered three children, a woman with a flesh wound in her side and an old man squatting down, hardly able to move. He had been seriously wounded and both legs from six feet. Burke called aimed his 45 caliber pistol and pulled the trigger causing the top of the man's head to fly off. It was a site that would forever be etched in maples memory. Burke hold claim to have shot the old man as an act of mercy.

Speaker 5:          01:25:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:25:40       Harry Stanley saw that the fleeing villagers were offering no resistance. His friend Alan Boys who lived in New Jersey, only a couple of miles from maples came up behind him with a Vietnamese foreigner aged between 40 and 50 years in custody. He wore black pajamas and his shirt hung open so that Stanley could see his chest. Boys pushed the man forward to where Stanley standing beside the

Speaker 3:          01:26:03       trail suddenly and for no reason. Boy stabbed the man with the bayonet attached to the end of his rifle. He fell to the ground grasping for breath. Boys killed him and then grabbed another man being detained, shot him in the neck and threw him into a well lobbing and him 26 grenade after him. That's the way you got to do it. He told Simpson, Robert Lee, the platoon medic, joined in the frenzy, but can find his efforts to slaughtering animals. He killed a cow that had been injured. Lee was from a farming community and didn't want to see the bees suffer upfront. He and the platoon sergeant, Isaiah Cowan could see women and children being slain. They were stunned by what was happening all around them. The further they went into the village, the more bodies they found to county, and he's another guy, Conti. The men appear to all psyched up when they landed. The shooting wants a, began created almost a chain reaction. He joined in without killing anyone inside the village. His comrades appeared out of control. Families huddled together for safety and houses in yards and in bunkers only to be mown down with automatic weapon fire or blown apart by fragmentation grenades, women and children were pushed into bunkers and grenades thrown after them.

Speaker 3:          01:27:28       At one point, wandering off on his own, conti found a woman aged about 20 with a four year old child. He forced her to perform oral sex on him while he held a gun at the child's head, threatening to kill it.

Speaker 3:          01:27:47       Half a dozen people from both platoons then witnessed a stocky, blond haired second platoon soldier from Kansas City called Gary Ross. Lovitz become a sterically when troops from first platoon were walking, a small group of villagers back for screening. Raw chevettes age 25 was older than most of the grunts in the company standing almost six feet tall and weighed close to 230 pounds. He made a surprise grab for Roy Woods [inaudible] and demanded the weapon as a trade for his m 79 but would wasn't having any. Don't turn them over to the company. Rush of it's appealed to. Those gathered there, kill them. Wood is physically by far is the smaller of the two men held tightly onto his rifle. Roster of Zen, snatched a hold of Bernado Simpsons. M 16 turned and shot a Vietnamese farmer in the head would began feeling sick at the side of the man's brain spilling on the ground as he turned away. Rush of it's shot. Two more peasants in the head before handing the gun back to Simpson in the northern position of the village. Second platoon had also run Bismarck employing the routine combat assault technique used by Kelly Steven Brooks. Men also approached line abreast in three squats firing as they moved, they came to dwellings and yelled out, lie day in Vietnamese for come here.

Speaker 3:          01:29:08       The villagers at the villagers sheltering, sheltering inside homemade shelters or bunkers, fragmentation grenades were tossed inside. Homes were sprayed with automatic fire. Children aged six or seven came toward them with their hands out stretch saying chop chop. They asked for Food and candy they had received from other American soldiers on the two previous visits to the village, the soldiers Skype them down after one group of Vietnamese were killed in front of a hot. The first squad leader, Sergeant Kenneth, she'll began telling his men that he didn't like what they were doing, but that they had to obey orders. The villagers at huddled together for safety, but the Americans poured fire into them, tearing their bodies apart. One man firing a machine gun at random other using m sixteens on automatic. Brooke's Radio Operator, Dean fields, witness for Natto Simpson shoot a woman with a baby from a distance of about 25 meters or arm was shot almost completely off at the wrist. All that it held. All that held it on was a fragile piece of flesh. She ran into a coach and someone yelled, in order for her and the baby to be killed.

Speaker 3:          01:30:26       Max Hudson, the weapons squad leader formed a machine gun team with Floyd, right. As soon as they past the tree line, they were confronted less than 30 feet away by a middle aged woman climbing out of a tunnel, using both hands. She was on armed, but they opened fire and she fell back into the tunnel. Hudson and right took turns on the machine gun. Whenever they came across any Vietnamese, they opened fire killing them. Hudson could see people firing all around him. The whole scene was one of chaos and confusion with people moving, yelling, and shouting. Some of the troops were afraid they would be shot by their own men.

Speaker 2:          01:31:06       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:31:08       In the clearing in a clearing near a small coach, a group of 15 Vietnamese had been gathered for women in their thirties three in their 50s three girls in their late teens and five children ages between three and 14 standing around where seven or eight soldiers from different squads, including Hutto, Torres and raw chevettes Gonzales heard someone yell that if anyone was behind the Vietnamese to take cover because they were going to open fire. A shot rang out when a bullet penetrated the head of a young child being carried by its mother, blowing out the back of its skull. Others began firing until the entire group was dead. Gonzalez could stand no more. He turned away and vomited. Few words were spoken until someone said, let's move out.

Speaker 2:          01:31:57       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:31:58       A soldier over a tunnel

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       yelled for the occupants to come out. Gonzales moved closer and could hear people responding as if they were about to comply. Where upon the soldier through in a grenade and yelled fire in the hole, telling everyone to stand clear.

Speaker 3:          01:32:15       Kelly had been called twice that morning on the radio by an anxious Medina. What is happening over there? Medina did demanded to know challenging the slow progress of the first platoon. He wanted Kelly to get his men back online and keep moving. This made the young platoon commander nervous throughout his time with the company. He had frequently been made the bud of Medina's jokes Medina new Cali couldn't command the respect of his men. Now under pressure, Cali replied that large groups of civilians had gathered and were slowing the platoon down. Never want to accept excuses. Medina told Kelly simply to get rid of them. So when Kelly came across meet low and conti and the clearing and said take care of them. His intention was clear. It was his way of getting Medina office back. Conti thought nothing of the implications of Kelly's request when you re simply replied.

Speaker 3:          01:33:12       Okay. Like many in the company, he regarded the man as a joke and resented cat the way Kelly tried to suck up to the men one minute by calling them by their first names and then shouted and bawled at them. The next conti felt his platoon commander had absolutely no leadership ability. Among the squatting. Vietnamese were 10 to 15 men with beards and 10 woman women as well as a handful of very elderly, gray haired women who could hardly walk. The rest were children of all ages, from babies up to early teens. Calley who is carrying a bandolier of ammunition on one shoulder said, I thought I told you to take care of them. Me Though responded somewhat naively, we are. We're watching over them. No re re posted Cali. I want them killed. He moved over to where conti was standing beside me low. We'll get online and fire into them. Conti and meet though. Look to each other and backed off. Neither of them wanting a part in what was about to happen. Cali losing his temper beckoned them toward him. Come here, come here. Come on. We'll line them up. We'll kill them. Conti searching for an excuse pointed out that he was carrying a grenade launcher and he didn't want to waste ammunition. Perhaps he could keep guard over by the tree line in case anyone tried to get away. He suggested Kelly turned to meet low

Speaker 3:          01:34:41       fire. When I say fire, Conti stood behind them as Kelly and me. Low standing side by side, blazed away. The stood only 10 feet from their hapless victims. Changing magazines. From time to time the Vietnamese screamed, yelled, and tried to get up. It was pure carnage. Has heads were shot off along with limbs. The flesh of your body parts were ripped to shreds. Meet low had taken 23 fully loaded magazines for his m 16 in his pack when they had left Dottie, he fired in a spraying motion. He noticed one man dressed in red fall dead as he fired the rifle on automatic until the magazine was exhausted. Then he reloaded. He switched to semiautomatic fire and loaded the third magazine. After a minute or so, meatloaf couldn't continue.

Speaker 5:          01:35:34       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:35:35       Tears flooded down his cheeks,

Speaker 5:          01:35:38       okay.

Speaker 3:          01:35:39       He turned, stuck his rifle and caught these hand and said, you shoot them conti. Push the weapon back. If they are going to be killed, I'm not going to do it. Let him do it. He said, pointing at Cali. By this time, Conti could see only a few children were left standing. Mothers had thrown themselves on top of the young ones in the last desperate bid to protect them from bullets raining down on them. The children were trying to stand up. Kelly open fire again, killing them one by one. Conti swore at him. Finally, when it appeared to be all over, Kelly calmly turned and said, okay, let's go. Suddenly someone yelled out that more Vietnamese, five women in six children, some distance away. We're making a break for the tree line. Kelly burst out, get them, get them, kill them.

Speaker 3:          01:36:36       Milos face was flushed. His eyes were still full of tears. When he arrived with grease sick at the ditch site and found Kelly sitting down, we've got another job to do. He said, looking up them, about 10 members of the platoon were guarding. 40 to 50 Vietnamese babies were crying and crawling around. James Darcy, a heavy set Irish Italian from Brooklyn was looking at a man in white robes with a goatee beard whom he took to be a Buddhist monk praying over an elderly woman. She was seriously ill and had been carried through the village on a narrow wooden platform, which the Vietnamese used as a bed. Kelly was now on his feet. Hairy Stanley appeared on the scene and tried to question the monk who is crying and bowing as he tried to make himself understood, Kelly couldn't understand him. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:37:29       who had attended Vietnamese language classes in Hawaii, tried more questions and got nowhere. Kelly was getting more and more impatient. Where had the Viet Cong gone? Where were the weapons? Where were the Nva when the man shook his head, Cali struck him in the mouth with his rifle, but just then a child aged about two years and parted from its mother, managed to crawl up to the top of the ditch. Darcy watched horrified as Kelly picked up the child, shoved it back down the slope and shot it before returning to question the monk, the villagers pleaded for the holy man's life. Stanley asked the bearded man the same questions in Vietnamese that Kelly was asking in English in an effort to diffuse the situation, but the monk vainly replied that there were no north Vietnamese soldiers in the village. There were no weapons.

Speaker 5:          01:38:20       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:38:21       Stanley translated these replies immediately. Kalee grabbed the monk, pulled him round, hurled him into the patty and open fire with Milos m 16 as the elderly Mama Sohn, lying pro streps prostrate tried to get up. She too was killed. More Vietnamese shepherded by soldiers were arriving on the scene and Kelly indicated Emilio and boys, he wanted everyone killed. He began pushing peasants into the irrigation channel. Others joined in using their rifle butts to shove whaling Vietnamese down the sleep steep slope. Some jumped in by themselves. Others sat down on the edge moaning and crying, clearly aware that disaster was imminent. It was a pitiful sight,

Speaker 5:          01:39:10       okay?

Speaker 3:          01:39:11       Until the time all the firing started, Herbert Carter had been kneeling beside Darcy quietly playing with a couple of children. Darcy said, incredulously, I think Kelly wants them all killed. Carter said, oh no, he can send me to jail, but I'm not going to kill anybody. Said Darcy beginning to move away and wondering what would happen to him for refusing to fire. Darcy was another one who liked to play with the children earlier in the day. He'd been devastated. After he opened fire and killed someone running from the village, it turned out to be a woman and carrying a baby, and Darcy was horrified and ashamed by what he had done. Olsen had seen. He was really caught up about it.

Speaker 5:          01:39:52       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:39:52       A woman standing next to Robert Maples showed him a bullet wound in her left arm. He felt helpless. There was nothing he could do for her. Kelly shoved her in the ditch and told Maples, load your machine gun and shoot these people. Maple shook his head and replied, I'm not gonna do that. Kelly turned his m 16 on Maples as if to shoot him. Then in there, maples will surprised and relieved when some of the other soldiers interpose to protect him. Kelly backed off. Seconds later, he and me low began firing. A machine gun opened up and one of the squad leaders tried to usher the man into line so they can all fire simultaneously. Darcy stewed completely frozen watching disbelievingly as the Vietnamese tried frantically to hide under one another. Mother's protecting babies.

Speaker 5:          01:40:44       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:40:44       Screaming at Dorsey above the sounds of the [inaudible] on full automatic meat. Low continued pouring shells into the ditch, crying hysterically

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       once more. He stopped for a second. Why are you firing? He pleaded with Darcy fire. Why don't you fire? Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:41:01       The onlookers saw remnants of shredded human beings, hundreds of pieces of flesh and bone flying up in the air as the shallow ravine was repeatedly sprayed with bullets magazine. After magazine was reloaded during the mass execution, it has all this,

Speaker 5:          01:41:29       okay.

Speaker 3:          01:41:31       Horrendous scene is unfolding. There is actually a, a photographer there, military photographer, aim haberly and he's taking pictures and he, it was almost like he was just instinctively shooting. He, he kind of detached himself.

Speaker 5:          01:41:57       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          01:41:59       And here's what he said. I knew it was something that shouldn't be happening, but yet I was part of it. I think I was in a kind of a daze from seeing all these shootings and not seeing any return fire yet. The killing kept going on. The Americans were rounding up the people and shooting them, not taking any prisoners. It was completely different to my concept of what war is all about. I kept taking pictures. That was my job as a photographer to take pictures, a normal reaction I have with a camera just picking up and keep on shooting, trying to capture what is happening around me. I feel sometimes that the camera did take over during the operation. I put it up to my, I took a shot, put it down. Nothing was composed. Nothing was pre thought, just the normal reaction of a photographer. I was part of it. Everyone who was there was part of it and that includes the general and the colonel flying above in their helicopters. They're all part of it.

Speaker 5:          01:42:55       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:42:56       We all were.

Speaker 5:          01:42:58       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:42:58       Just a one big group.

Speaker 3:          01:43:02       Now as all this is is happening, you've got Medina, who's the, again, the company commander. He sorta coming up from the rear and he starting to assess what he's seeing back to the book. While mudita might not have seen mass executions taking place, the evidence of his own eyes told him what everyone else could see, that some kind of massacre had occurred. In fact, it was a worse than a massacre. Too many of Medina's men were taking sword pleasure in sadistic behavior. Several became double veterans, GI slang for the dubious honor of raping a woman and then murdering her. Many women were raped and sodomized, mutilated, and had their vaginas ripped open with knives or bay and nets.

Speaker 5:          01:43:55       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:43:56       One woman was killed when the muzzle of a rifle barrel was inserted into her vagina and the trigger was pulled. Soldiers repeatedly stabbed their victims, caught off limbs, sometimes beheaded them. Some were scalped, others had their tongues caught out or their throats slit or both Tommy Lee Moss saw Vietnamese place their hands together and bowed. Agreed Americans only it'd be beaten with fists and tortured club with rifles and stabbed in the back with bayonets. Martin Fagan saw bodies which had been shot in the head at point blank range. He could tell because the penetration of an m 16 round create a shock wave inside the skull, forcing the brain completely out.

Speaker 5:          01:44:42       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:44:43       Other victims were mutilated with the signature c company or the shape of an ace of spades carved into the chest. Fagin figured this had been done as a warning to the superstitious Vietnamese. It was widely believed that they regarded the ace of spades as a sign of bad luck.

Speaker 5:          01:45:00       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:45:00       Troops from all three platoons carried out wanting and mindless acts of brutality. The second platoon were already amongst the most notorious rapists and Charlie company. Even the platoon commander joined in on occasions. Raw chevettes forced the women too on dress with the intention of having sex with all of them. If they didn't strip, he said he was going to shoot them. He singled out one woman telling her to boom, boom him. She became a Richele and the other women panicked, yelling and screaming and begging for mercy. Russia vits decided to let them have it.

Speaker 3:          01:45:40       He fired several rounds and killed them all and now we got [inaudible] again. He's the photographer and this is what he's witnessing. Just as soon as I turned away, I heard firing. I saw people drop. They started falling on top of each other, one on top of another. I just kept walking. I did not pay attention to who did it. By that time I knew what the score was. It was an atrocity. I felt I wanted to do something to stop this as though as we were going through the village, I asked some soldiers why they more or less shrugged their soldiers and kept on with the killing.

Speaker 5:          01:46:16       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:46:16       It was like they were fixed on one thing, search and destroy, and that meant killing civilians. I noticed this one small boy had been shot in the foot. Part of the foot was torn off. He was walking towards a group of bodies looking for his mother.

Speaker 5:          01:46:31       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:46:31       I put up my camera up to my eye, I what's going to take a photograph? I didn't notice a Gi down beside me with his m 16 rifle pointed at the child.

Speaker 5:          01:46:42       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:46:43       Then suddenly I heard the crack and through the view finder, I saw this child flip over on top of the pile of bodies. The Gi just stood up and walked away. No remorse, nothing. The other soldiers had a cold reaction. They were staring off into space like it was an everyday thing. They felt they had to do it and they did it. That was their job. It was weird. Just a shrug of the shoulder. No emotional reaction. Now, above this, you had above this horror. You had helicopters that were flying around. They were, some of them were gunships, some of them were there to pick people up, drop people off. Some of them were commanding control. Helicopters were some senior leadership was flying around trying to observe the, the battles that took place. And we do end up with a, uh, with a, a real hero here, a hero that's a helicopter pilot and his name is Hugh [inaudible] Thompson Jr.

Speaker 5:          01:47:59       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:47:59       And he's flying around and I'll go to the book. Thompson marked several wounded people on the ground with green smoke a signal that they needed help. Returning to the mee Lai area about 9:00 AM after the first refueling. Thompson immediately noticed that people who were previously injured were now dead. There are groups of bodies as well as many dead water buffalo over the radio. He warned the gunships to fire only when they could positively identify enemy target. They had good visibility as they hovered sometimes only four feet, five feet off the ground. Gunner Lawrence Colburn in the doorway, didn't want to look at the corpses out in the patty. Fueled beside a dike 200 meters south of the village. They watched a small group of soldiers approach and injured Woman Age 20 Thomson had marked her with smoke. They were flying close enough for Colburn to look at her face as she lay half in and half out of the dike.

Speaker 3:          01:48:59       She made a feeble gesture with her hand and was obviously you need of help. Thompson put the aircraft into a stand, still hover only a few feet off the ground. The high gunship told the ground forces on the radio. You have a wounded over where the bubble is hovering. Thompson and his crew watched as an infantry offer officer wearing captain's bars on his helmet, came up to the woman product or with his foot, and then killed her. Those and the helicopter could hardly believe what they were seeing. Minutes later, over on the eastern side of the village, they saw dozens of bodies in the air, negation, ditch movements from the ditch, convinced them there were people still alive, not far away. A group of infantry men taking a cigarette break, sat around on the ground and relaxed taking off their steel pots. It was obvious there was no fire fight taking place.

Speaker 3:          01:49:53       So now what happens is, is Thompson, he's starting to get you starting to be totally disturbed by what he's seen down there. So he lands a helicopter and gets out of the helicopter and he goes over and talks to a young infantry officer. Young infantry officer came, came up, and Thompson questioned him about what was happening on the ground. The officer said there was none of his business because he was in charge of the ground troops. Several members of Cali's platoon observed Thompson's intervention. Kelly had gone to speak with the bubble helicopter pilot. Stanley overheard Cali telling sledge forward sledge afterward that the pilot hadn't liked what he'd, what was taking place. He don't like the way I'm running the show, but I'm the boss here. Olsen who wanted no part in the executions at the irrigation ditch had moved to 150 meters out to the patty.

Speaker 3:          01:50:44       Fueled to set up a perimeter of defense. He saw the pilot angrily shaking his arms and just stipulating frustrated. Thompson lifted off again and circled the area for a few minutes. Almost as soon as he took off his worst fears were confirmed and [inaudible] reported the sergeant was now shooting. The people in the ditch. Thompson began thinking about what the Nazis had done in the last war, marching people to a ditch and blowing them away furious with himself and everybody else. He finally snapped. He flew over the northeast corner of the village and spotted a group of about 10 civilians, including children running towards a homemade bomb shelter, pursuing them or a group of from second platoon. Returning to the village from the murders expedition. Based on all he had seen in the village that morning, it was obvious to Thompson what would happen when the troops got to the fleeing civilians.

Speaker 3:          01:51:37       He landed his aircraft between the villagers and the soldiers and radioed the gunships. He needed help screaming to his crew that he had to get the people out of the bunker. He issued an instruction that bewildered Colburn if the Americans began shooting on the villagers. Thompson said Colburn would turn his machine gun on. The Americans opened up on him, blow him away. Thompson urged him. Colburn turned his gun around to face the GIS. Though he was unsure whether he would be able to open fire on his own. Men concerned for their own safety. Collbran wasn't sure it was a good idea to land in the middle of a combat zone. The pilot confronted, confronted the lieutenant in charge, Steven Brooks. He said he wanted to help get the peasants out of the bunker. Brooks told him the only way to do that was with hand grenades.

Speaker 3:          01:52:23       Thompson shouted that he would personally get them out and told the lieutenant to stay put. With that, he went across the bunker and gingerly coax the civilians to come out. Crew members in the gunships overhead. Her Thompson announced over the radio that an old man was sitting in the path of the troops near the door of a small bomb shelter. Thompson's voice was choking with, he swore obscenities cursed and pleaded with the aero crew to come down and help rescue civilians. One pilot initially queried at the request and Thompson threatened that if the infantry open fire on the civilians, his machine gunner would turn his guns on the Americans. Danny millions are worn officer on the low. Gunship realize the delicate nature of the drama unfolding below and knowing that Thomson couldn't talk directly with the ground troops radio, the hide gun ship to tell the infantry to stop killing millions. And Brian Livingston, the another pilot landed their ships and flew the Vietnamese two men, two women and five or six children four miles away to the safety of the road, which ran west.

Speaker 5:          01:53:31       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:53:32       I mean it's uh, you can't get any more drama than that. And eventually Thompson gets back to base and I'll go to the book. They arrived back at Dottie at about 11:00 AM Thompson got out of the aircraft and threw his helmet on the ground. He told his section leader what had happened and when millions and Livingston landed, they confirmed it. A group of them sought out their company commander, Major Fred Wonky in the aviation sections, operation van. They told him everything that he had seen walk you walked up the hill to the low ceiling, 10 of attack operation center and pass the information onto barker. He in turn quickly got on the radio to his executive officer, Major Charles Calhoun, who was flying in a helicopter over the battlezone Calhoun was instructed to find out what was happening and get it stopped. There had been allegations that civilians had been shot. Barker wanted assurance from Edina that nothing of this kind was happening. The order went out to Charlie company to cease fire

Speaker 5:          01:54:45       and they did. And

Speaker 3:          01:54:52       almost as quickly as it started, it stopped. And it shows you that this whole time when all this horror was taking place,

Speaker 3:          01:55:11       anybody could have stopped it. Had they stepped up and said something and spoke. Now it might've been hard for someone that's a junior enlisted guy that's 18 years old that thinks he's carrying out the mission, but any of those people in the leadership position and even some of the folks that weren't leadership positions, if you're, if you're there and you start to say, no, this isn't going to be happening. I mean, and you did your were some guys on the ground that resisted, but no one was able to actually stop it. It's one of those bizarre things when I, when I, when I hear that, that all it took was that order. See Foreign. Okay, we'll stop shooting it.

Speaker 5:          01:55:52       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          01:55:54       It shows you the power of leadership.

Speaker 5:          01:55:59       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:56:00       and the responsibility of leadership. Now as this story goes forward, the first thing that happens is a big coverup and they talk about this operation like it was just a great victory over the VC and in fact a message. I'm going to the book here, a message of congratulations for the pink feel operation. That's what the operation is called. Pinkville was received from General Westmoreland himself in a post script. The brigade commander described the me lie operation as having been an outstanding success. The Praiseworthy Role of units and the 11th Infantry Brigade directly reflects your expert guidance, leadership, and devotion to duty. He wrote to Medina, copying the memo to Barker. The quick response and professionalism displayed during this action has enhanced the brigades image in the eyes of higher commands. So there you go. Within a few hours, the army's PR machine was pumping out a colorful image of daring do by the American troops.

Speaker 3:          01:57:17       The Mac v Communique issued later the same day from Saigon, gave brief details. The operation announcing that American division forces had killed 128 enemy, six miles northeast of quieting city. US troops surrounded reds kill 128 and there was another headline that went out that said, TF barker crushes enemy's stronghold. That attitude continues now Barker, the battalion commander ends up being killed before he's killed his. He releases his assessment of the operation, and this is where you start to see a seat cover up written all over this. Here's, here's barkers official report. This operation was well planned, well executed and successful, friendly casualties were light and the enemy suffered heavily on this operation. The civilian population supporting the VC in the area and numbered approximately 200. This created a problem and population control and medical care of those civilians caught in the fire of opposing forces. However, the infantry unit on the ground and helicopters were able to assist civilians and leaving the area and in caring for and or evacuating the wounded just lies, just lies. Then another, another, uh,

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       piece. Barker was generally concerned, genuinely concerned that civilians be protected in future operations. And there's no way he could have known that dreadful atrocity being committed by Charlie company at the time it was happening. But it's clear he quickly became part of the coverup. He knew civilians had died and a lot of them

Speaker 3:          01:59:03       now the, so, so this starts to gain a little bit of traction. People are starting to talk about, there's rumors. So even though these big nice headlines come out and the official report comes out, but people start to know about it. And so they start sending Charlie company in all kinds of crazy long term operations out in the field and they start to feel like, well, go to the book. Gis felt they were being sent out in, in the hopes that they all might be killed. They tried to bury us out there with Merck. Bitterly remembered after me lie. We went out in the field for three months straight. We never came back into the villages. Our trips to the base camps were few and far between. They had a problem and dealt with us by trying to hide out, hide us out in the jungle, hoping we'd all get killed. But we didn't.

Speaker 3:          01:59:59       So a guy, like I said, people are talking about it. There's rumors about it. And there's a guy named ride an hour who checks in to Charlie company and he starts hearing stories. He starts hearing stories. He starts, they start telling them, they start talking. And this is why you can't ever cover anything up. This is why coverups never work. Never try and cover anything up because it's going to come. It's gonna come out, it's going to come out. If you try and cover something up, it's going to come out. That's the way it works. So this guy a ride an hour after he hears enough and he talks to all these different people that are more involved and they tell them what they did and what went down. And he kind of gathers all that information. And here we go back to the book riding Hauer.

Speaker 3:          02:00:47       He writes a letter, he writes a letter that explains what he had learned, what he'd found out. And here we go, right? And Hauer posted the letter on April 2nd, 1969 to you doll and 30 prominent men in Washington DC, including President Nixon, the secretary defense, Melvin Laird, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff, Edward Kennedy, Barry Goldwater, Eugene McCarthy, and William Fulbright. He sent the letters registered mail thinking that staff opening them would be bound to take the comments, the contents more seriously. And here's a little excerpt from the, from the letter gentlemen. It was in late April, 1968 that I first heard of Pinkville and what allegedly happened there. I received that first report with some skepticism, but in the following months I was to hear similar stories from such a wide variety of people that it became impossible for me to disbelieve that something rather dark and bloody did indeed occur sometime in March, 1968 in a village called Pinkville in the Republic of Vietnam.

Speaker 3:          02:01:59       So that's how the story breaks there. Start to investigate it within the Pentagon. They start to investigate it as great. This book is Great. It goes into a ton of detail on what that's like, how that takes place, the people that are running it and there's good, honest, solid, you know, army leadership that says, oh no, we're going to, we're going to find out what happened and we're going to, we're going to do something about it. So the cover up isn't throughout the chain of command. There's people that that try and put a stop to it. Now, the other thing that turns very

Speaker 3:          02:02:34       interesting on this is obviously when it hits the public, and one of the most shocking impacts to the public took place on television. And, and if you remember at this time, and I don't know if this was like for for you because you're a little bit younger than me, but when I was a kid, we had three TV channels. You know, there was no 57 or 147 or 1000 TV channels and there was no internet. We didn't really, there wasn't really radio shows anymore. So if the family was going to do something at night, at six o'clock at night or seven o'clock at night together after dinner, there was a good chance they were going to sit down and watch TV. And now you go back this 1969 so it's even more focused on television. And so what happens is this story breaks on TV with an interview, and I'll go to the book with me. Those confession

Speaker 3:          02:03:29       television was for most Americans, quintessentially a medium of entertainment. Milos confession was truly an extraordinary departure from the vapid diet of soap operas, comedy programs, and quiz shows. News, however, was important to American audiences. Walter Cronkite was a national institution. Milos interview was delivered virtually without warning to an audience of millions of parents and children waiting excitedly for news of Apollo 12 astronauts returned from the moon and the splashed down into the Pacific Ocean. So that's what that everyone thinks. That's where they're going to, oh, let's get the kids to watch the news and we'll find out about Yay. Yay America, back to the book. Instead, their living rooms appeared. The GOC, his figure of a young man from Indiana, me low, brought to the audience are raw truth about Vietnam. They would prefer not to have known. He chillingly described lining up first the first group of villagers and shooting them down, expanding four clips of ammunition in the killing. There were 17 bullets to a clip, which Wallace deducted deduced 68 shots at the ditch execution site. Me Lo said he was ordered to fire single shots to conserve ammunition. Wallace wanted to know why he did it

Speaker 3:          02:04:55       and here's the interview. Why did I do it? Because I felt like I was ordered to do it and it seemed like that at the time I felt like I was doing the right thing because I lost buddies. I lost a damn good buddy, Bobby Wilson, and it was on my conscience. So after I'd done it, I felt good, but later on that day it was getting to me.

Speaker 5:          02:05:20       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:05:20       you're married, right? Children to how old? The boy is two and a half and the little girl is a year and a half. Well, obviously the question comes to mind. The father of two little kids like that. How can he shoot babies? I didn't have the little girl. I just had the little boy at the time. How do you shoot babies? I don't know. It's just one of them things. How many people would you imagine were killed that day? I would say three 70 what did these civilians, these, particularly the women and children, the old man. What did they do? What did they say to you? Were they weren't begging or anything? No. No, or right. They were begging and saying, no, no, and their mothers were hugging their children, but they kept on firing. Well, we kept on firing. They was waving their arms and begging. Did you ever dream about all this that went on and Pinkville? Yes, I did and I still dream about it. What kind of dreams? I see the women and children in my sleep some days. Some nights I can't sleep. I just lay there thinking about it. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:06:43       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:06:44       so that's not exactly the, the friendly news that you're expecting to see about the Apollo mission.

Speaker 3:          02:06:53       Now this thing goes to trial and again, you got to get into the book to see how all this breaks down, but a couple highlights. Here's lieutenant Calley during the trial and how he, how he testified on what he did and it's a good insight into his mindset. Here we go. Key lieutenant Calley. I was ordered to go in there and destroy the enemy. That was my job that day. That was my mission. I was given. I did not sit down and think in terms of men, women, and children, they were all classified the same. And that was the classification that we dealt with just as enemy soldiers. I felt then, and I still do that. I acted as I was directed and I carried out the orders that I was given and I do not feel wrong in doing so. And

Speaker 5:          02:07:45       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:07:47       you know, we, we get very used to the, uh, the media. I mean, we're in a media circus nowadays because there's so much media. There's social media, there's cable media, there's internet media. I mean, we get, there's a circus of media now and you get a lot, I would say you can get a lot more distracted. I mean, new stories here don't last that long, but this was, this was a big news story and it was really dividing the country in a way, even more so than the country has already been divided by the Vietnam War. But in, I'll go to the book here. To many Americans, Cali was a hero and they believed that with the guilty verdict, he was found guilty. A great injustice had been perpetrated upon the army. And in Vietnam they gave an example here in Vietnam that soldiers at case on had hastily raised defiance sign that said a troop first Cav solutes, William Calley. So you got people that are saying, Hey, what, you know, Kelly was, Kelly did the right thing out there.

Speaker 3:          02:08:52       On top of that, uh, this was a good example of what the attitude of some Americans were at, was at a, a World War II veteran went into an army recruiting office in Mobile, Alabama to make an extraordinary request. He had flown bombing missions over Germany, which had killed innocent civilians and wanted to be arrested for war crimes despite in, and another good example that somebody sent a goat, a Billy goat of living Billy goat and send it to the White House and it had a jacket on and the jacket said, scape goat on it. And this, this is, this is pretty cool. The response that the army and the government had to this Kelly is not a scape goat nor a poor lieutenant singled out to bear the entire burden of a difficult war. Declared a high level army memorandum circling amongst senior staff at the White House, his act stand alone in infamy among known atrocities for the US forces in a war. If Kelly is let go or let off with a slap on the wrist, the message to all soldiers must read anything goes. The implications for the army, let alone the nation are incalculable, but clearly in tolerable.

Speaker 5:          02:10:14       Okay,

Speaker 3:          02:10:15       so they did a hold the line and recognize that that that this was not good. And at the same time you still got these people that were saying that, look, this is, this is a war and here's, here's a, a quote from the book take by way of example, the following the American soldier in an officially sanctioned wrath is a thing so ugly in dangerous that it would take a Kipling to describe him. Not a description of me lie, but the observation of James h blunt, a young lieutenant later to come later to become a judge on the behavior of troops in the Philippines 60 years before Vietnam. Here's another comment about what that war was like. The the war in the Philippines. Our men have been relentless, have killed to exterminate men, women and children, prisoners and captives, active insurgents and suspected people from lads have 10 up in idea prevailing that the Filipino was little better than a dog.

Speaker 3:          02:11:24       And another comparison here from the book in the Dakotas General William Tecumseh Sherman had written to General Ulysses Ulysses s grant. We must act with vindictive, earn earnestness against the Su even to the extermination, men, women and children. Nothing else. We'll reach the root of the case. It was talking about the Indian wars there. And then another one, just a description that sort of explains how horrible war is. And this one was from World War II. What kind of award to civilian? Suppose we fought anyways, we shot prisoners in cold blood, wiped out hospitals, strafed light lifeboats, killed or mistreated enemy. Civilians finished off the enemy wounded, toss the dying into a hole with the dead and in the Pacific boiled the flesh off enemies, skulls to make table ornaments for sweethearts or carved their bones into letter openers.

Speaker 5:          02:12:25       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:12:26       That was written by an American warp corresponded, Edward L. Jones.

Speaker 5:          02:12:34       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:12:35       Now where were those where those ideas become so disturbing and again, W war is hell, war is dark or is evil. How the things happen. And again, when you have a lack of leadership, things get even worse and it can happen even to these apparently normal guys. And here's Michael Bernhardt talking about what it was like in what he thought of people after he got home. I had seen people who look like everybody else, normal people doing atrocious things and I really wasn't sure how anyone would have acted in the same situation. I thought I knew human nature. I thought that people were basically good, that they couldn't do this. I thought most of the values people held were pretty solid. That when we defined things as good or bad that they were good or bad and that we would know when something was really bad, but I had seen that this was not the case. I wasn't sure I could trust anyone. Again, I wasn't sure I could ever get close to anyone or confide in anyone very closely because of what I'd seen over there. And going back to the leadership piece, and this is from the book, what steps were taken to Holt, the run of beatings, thefts, rapes, tortures and murder, which prodded Charlie company down the road to me lie none. Who among the chain of command that found on its bottom rung Lieutenant William Calley and rose through Medina Barker, Henderson and cost or gave any kind of moral lead or example that might have prevented the moral destruction of the company? No one

Speaker 3:          02:14:36       in place of clear leadership. There was paper leadership, the rules of engagement, numerous codes of conduct and all other directives, all of which contained the loftiest intentions. There was nothing wrong with these regulations and spirit. They were a recognizable expression of the American ideal at war. A blueprint for order in the midst of hell. They simply never became part of the soldiers reality because they weren't never seriously in forced and without emphatic enforcement. They corresponded as much to the world of the common grunt as roadmaps of Mars. That total lack of leadership, that lack of moral courage and

Speaker 2:          02:15:40       okay,

Speaker 3:          02:15:41       as we close this out, it goes in the book here and says, once again, the darker side of war has gone underground. Me Lie is no longer a public burden or concern. The burden of guilt and the burden of responsibility have fallen onto the soldiers themselves. Shit, that man of Charlie company used to tell each other rolls down hill and we'll close out with the words from Varnado Simpson.

Speaker 2:          02:16:18       Okay,

Speaker 3:          02:16:19       who's in his own little private hell with his memories of this? As you sit shaking from side to side in his chair alone in his house in Jackson, Mississippi,

Speaker 1:          02:16:32       how can you forgive? I can't forgive myself for the things, even though I know that it was something that I was told to do, but how can I forget that or forgive? It's easy for you to say, well, go ahead with your life, but how can you go ahead with your life when this is holding you back? I can't put my mind to anything. Yes, I'm ashamed. I'm sorry I'm guilty, but I did it. You know, what else can I tell you?

Speaker 5:          02:17:11       It happened. It happened it as we

Speaker 1:          02:17:27       think about this book and you should go and get this book and you should read this book and you should experience this level of darkness in the world so that we can all remember to be vigilant against this power of darkness, which,

Speaker 5:          02:17:51       okay,

Speaker 1:          02:17:52       I suppose we have to admit that that darkness is in every man's soul lurking and waiting, waiting for a moment to strike out. But we, we need to counter that. We need to counter that, that evil with good. And we need to do that with the power of leadership. And you can see in these situations where leaders led men to do things that they knew were wrong. They knew they were wrong, things that they didn't want to do. Killing children as tears are streaming down their faces. And if you can lead men to do things that they know are wrong, imagine the power and the influence you have as a leader to lead people to do things that are right and that people know are right in that are good and you are leader. I am a leader. No matter what your station in life or your position or your rank, you are a leader. When you step up and lead, you are a leader and you can make a difference and you can have an impact and you can affect the outcomes of so many things in the world by stepping up and leading.

Speaker 1:          02:19:50       Oh Way from the evil in a way. From the darkness.

Speaker 5:          02:19:58       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:19:59       and toward the light.

Speaker 5:          02:20:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:20:09       Then I know that was a, that's a rough book and this is a rough podcast.

Speaker 5:          02:20:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:20:20       In, in, like I said, I was, I was questioning whether to actually do this or not.

Speaker 5:          02:20:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:20:28       In in at certain points when I was reading this, I mean this is my fourth time reading it, I think, and even when I was reading it just now on the podcast for this recording, I could, I could hear a numbness in my voice. I could hear it as I'm talking about the killing and the gunning down and the f eight so much, and I know it's going to be brutal. I know people are going to be impacted by this and maybe not everyone's going to make it through this and I understand that, but we owe it to ourselves to know history and to know and understand evil and to understand how quickly it can come about and to see these indicators and to know that if you're in a leadership position, you start to see things going sideways. You've got to put a stop to them before they get out of hand before they turn into this.

Speaker 5:          02:21:35       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          02:21:40       Maybe at some point we'll look for some topics that are a little bit more,

Speaker 1:          02:21:49       I guess, lighthearted, lighthearted, eh, but I'll tell you what my only issue with that is you want a topic that's lighthearted. You can find them anywhere. You can go get him anywhere. There's a, there's a whole, actually there's a whole section for a podcast that's called comedy, right? It's called comedy that that exists. There's no section that says the darkness, I guess there is one. It's called Jocko podcast. You want to hear about the darkness, you want to hear about things that are going on in the world that aren't good. This is it here where the people that are dealing with reality,

Speaker 5:          02:22:23       okay.

Speaker 6:          02:22:24       You know, I know this, this is for everybody and that's okay. That's okay. You know, we're talking about heavy topics here in the reason we're talking about the dark is because we want to be enlightened. We want to know about

Speaker 4:          02:22:40       these things.

Speaker 6:          02:22:45       I don't think we're going to have time for Q and a because I just talked about that book for a really long time. Um, so what we'll do is do a Q and a for the next podcast. And for this one we'll let it stand on its own.

Speaker 6:          02:23:07       And I know it might be a rough podcast to think about wanting to hear more of them, but if you do want to hear more of these podcasts, Echo, what can these folks do to support the podcasts? Well, as I always recommend, sure, support the podcast, but you can also support yourself with supplementation on it, on it has the best supplements. Uh, the actual supplements that I take chocolate takes on it.com/jocko, you can get 10% off. So support yourself physically and financially in that way. Um, I would recommend, what do you think? Well, what's the number one you think Krill oil? I think it depends on who you are. I thank you for you. [inaudible] Krill oil. All you, uh, uh, alphabet I like. Yeah, and they're just a anyway, so Alpha brain, good for your brain, makes you think quicker. It makes you like you did you just say Alpha brain?

Speaker 6:          02:24:11       Cause I got the whole song right here for me as Jocko drinks off of brain instant, by the way. Um, it makes you think, you know, like when you search for words, like in your, you know, when you're trying to think of a word sometimes. Yes, yes. From brain. You feel like Levy pathways to them, the words a little bit closer. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually you can read all about, it's called a nootropic Alpha brain. Yes. Good free rein anyway. A krill oil goodfree joints. That's the one Jocko takes. That's why he's so functional. I would say for lack of a better term proving channel. I like that word though. And warrior bars, that's a new one right there. The warrior bores that. That's not like some, you know, they, they've been having, well actually nootropics pretty it needs to, but you know how you have protein powder that's been around, but where are your party?

Speaker 6:          02:24:58       That's a, that's a new twist on things that good about what's good about, like you talked about protein powder. That's like a powder, right? Well, you get a protein bar, that's a thing that's been manufactured. Right? Like a bar. Yeah. The warrior bar is like food. Yeah. Yeah. So that makes it a little bit better in my mind. Yeah. It's cause I want to eat food. Yeah. So, so it's kind of like in the direction of a beef jerky situation, but more, even more. Anyway, let's look at it. The thing is there's two, there's two major differences between beer for beef jerky and warrior bar and that is beef jerky, dry warrior bar, not dry. Delish. Yup. And then a shroom tech. Good for like high intensity kind of prolonged stuff. Do Jitsu. If you're into it. Wrestling, metcon met, cross fit. Well there you go.

Speaker 6:          02:25:45       Shroom tech. Boom. Yeah, improve your output, your performance, utilize oxygen better. Anyway, it's really good. Like really good. Um, also another way to support the podcast. If you're in the mood to, before you do your Amazon shopping, go to Jocko podcast.com and click on the Amazon link. What does that cost you? That doesn't cost you anything except for literally literally three seconds. So your time, three seconds. And you support the podcast. Yup. I like that. In one click. Maybe like a one 10th of a calorie maybe finger clip. I like that. But yeah, super easy. The main thing asking people to donate money there. No. Amazon's going to donate the money. Yeah, they're going to, they're going to support the podcast like collective. Yeah, it's good. Um, so boom, there you go there. I guess the main thing is to remember to do it. You know when you, you're trying to get that duct tape real quick.

Speaker 6:          02:26:37       Oh, I got to make that time so he can ship that same day. You know? Then you've got to, you just want to maybe take some Alpha brain that'll help you remember. I like that anyway. Or, or if you want some chocolate stuff, like some cool shirts, Jocko, store.com I'm seeing a new shirt. Is that correct here? Yes. We have a new shirt. The trooper shirt, Dutch. It's got a name. Are we naming shirts now? We have to name it. So this is, some people don't Echo Charles. He is an artist. He's an artist. And so that's why he has to Dame the t shirt. Yeah. You know, you, you just have to name it because that makes you feel like it's a piece of art is it's a piece. Because you just said the trooper shirt as if that's the thing. But here's the thing though, with this shirt and with like with all the shirts, it's not just like, well I'm going to call it the trooper shirt.

Speaker 6:          02:27:29       Cause I think that sounds cool. It's like there's different layers. It's not just a shirt with a saying on it. And like this, believe me, it's not just, you're saying it's not just called the trooper tee shirt. It actually is. Yeah. Like we were coming and you're wearing it right now. If you're on youtube, you can check it out. Three colors. Ooh, that's a unique when usually we'll have two tellers protest, something like that. No, but you can protest it. And this is why. So the people who signed up on, on the insider's group, the email list, uh, I, people that are enlisted troopers, you know the Jocko podcast there as well. How do they do that? Well, we'll jump on Jocko, star.com right on the front and you just put your email address and I don't spam, that's not what it's for. This is what it's for.

Speaker 6:          02:28:13       This is one of the things that it was for and the people who are on the list notice where, hey, I got a new shirt design idea. You know, uh, I don't know what colors really to what are the best colors, right? I know what colors I like. Yeah, I'll do a black one. I'll do. But, so what I did was I sent an email to everybody instead of what, here's what, here's the design, here's what it kind of will look like. What color shirts are we doing? What color shirts do you guys like? So there's a, there was a vote. There was input received. Yes. Yeah. Like, uh, yeah. And the consensus was these three colors, like a dark red. Oh. Which actually turned out even better than I thought, and I was enthusiastic about the red and the Odi Green. I support Odie green that way if you have to, you never know when you might have to go tactical purpose things, things that can be good for normal situations or tactical situations.

Speaker 6:          02:29:10       That's why I like Odie green tee shirts. Yeah. Just in case you get a spring into getting after it spontaneously. And then of course we've got the black, but that was the consensus overall. The green there was a charcoal had a strong strong, um, you know, but uh, yeah. Is the green, the red and the black. But anyway, yeah, it's a cool, check it out if you want to look at the details of it there. Um, yeah, you're good. Anyway. If you want to support the podcast that way, get a shirt. This trooper shirt isn't the only one, but man, I, I, I'm pretty, I'm pretty fired up about it. It looks good. I think. Anyway, there's other ones on there too that are cool and a coffee mugs and stickers if you're down. I like, but yeah, that's the way, those are the ways and uh, for the people who have been and do Dang to say thank you. It'd be like not even doing it halfway justice.

Speaker 1:          02:30:02       Yeah, definitely. Thanks everybody I feel for doing that. And you know, you know what's weird, you always talk about like how you got to see that you got to see the dark to, to appreciate it, appreciate the light. Right. I actually just, cause we just got done with that dark, dark darkness of a book in just having a conversation right now. I'm so happy just to be like here and talking and we're, we're selling some cool t shirts and drinking just to be just in this situation and know that we have this goodness around us is, uh, is really good. So I think it is worth venturing into the dark so that you can appreciate the light. If you want to hear more of this kind of things. Obviously you've got the podcast, you can also pick up a book written by myself and my brother Leif Babin. It's called extreme ownership. You can buy the book or you can buy the audio book, which is actually Lafe and I reading it. So you'll get some more information in there. And that's everything I talk about is, is in that book. I mean that's, that's the basic principles of combat leadership that we put in there.

Speaker 6:          02:31:14       Let me add one thing about extreme that book extreme ownership. It's good. It's like Dang, this is you fee or I dunno, everyone's different but me, I felt like more of an adult after like 10 incorporating these like, but here's the thing that you do take away is the people around you will notice that you're a better person to be around. And I, I thought I was like pretty nice anyway, but you'll feel people like gravitating towards you more because like any abrasive and everyone has varying levels of abrasiveness in them. Even if it's just a teeny tiny little bit, everyone has self. But what that does is it makes you work with people in a way less abrasive way. So people want to be around you when things go. Now,

Speaker 1:          02:32:03       I would say that's, that's a very good assessment and I'll tell you that I was, felt it, especially when I was in the, when I was in the military, in the seal teams, when, when I was doing something, people wanted to come with me. Yeah. It was all good. We all wanted to get after it together. So that's probably an indicator of the principals

Speaker 6:          02:32:24       in the book at work in my life. Yeah. You don't have some people, um, I mean, I dunno, maybe us, whatever, where, you know, you'll have a small little conflict or a little something, little friction with somebody's conflict in Wa maybe at work or even at home or whatever. I would say it's pretty rare. Like I'm not, like if there was some friction that came up between me and anyone, even my friend, my wife or something, it would stand out so much nowadays. Like it would come up better person, you become better person. Yeah. That, and that's at the end. That's all. But like I said, it's like if you, if you follow it, if you, you're like, Dang, I, you know, I value this and I'm going to, you actually incorporate it as time goes on. That's how it is. Where if you get friction or some adversarial situation, even if it's not yours, you're like, Dang, I see that from a mile away, you know, and it sticks out. So it's not, I mean, some people it's part of their everyday thing just for road rage or I don't know any of the thing, but it's, yeah, it's good man. It's good like that.

Speaker 1:          02:33:33       Well thanks. I appreciate it. Check it out and you can get it on Amazon after you click through the website, you know, uh, closing it up everybody, if you want to talk to us more beyond that, you can get us on the inner webs. Echos, add Echo Charles. I am at jockowillink. That's on Twitter. The Facebooky and even have a little bit to the Instagram going on. If you've actually answered most of the, well, actually every single thing that comes on Twitter, I will respond to. I'm going to see how long I can keep that up for, I don't know how long it's gonna last. It's getting pretty hardcore right now, but I'm definitely reading everything that's coming in and we appreciate the feedback we get from you guys and you guys bring it a little light to all worlds. Much appreciated. And thanks for bringing that light to us. And most of all, thanks for going out there and getting after it. And so until next time, this is echoing Jocko out.
