Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number one 21 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening.

Speaker 2:          00:00:11       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:00:12       I'm going to tell you a story and this is a story of war and pain and love and death.

Speaker 2:          00:00:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:32       And this story.

Speaker 2:          00:00:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:36       This is a heroic story, quite possibly one of the most heroic stories and at the same time this story is also a tragedy and it is quite possibly one of the most tragic stories.

Speaker 2:          00:01:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       This is a story of a father and a son. This is a story that spans six wars each one more difficult than the next. This is a story of life. We had like all stories of life. This story ends the way that all lives and this story ends in death.

Speaker 2:          00:01:34       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:35       There is no story book ending. There is no walking off into the sunset. There is no mercy and no quarter and no remorse from death.

Speaker 2:          00:01:47       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:01:48       good. As I prepared to tell this story, there were times when I started to decide against it.

Speaker 2:          00:02:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:03       Where I began to think it would be too much. There was another part of me that spoke louder and spoke stronger and that other part of me that knows that to hide from the darkness is only to allow darkness to grow and I will not do that. I will tell this story and this story that I am going to tell is not just a story. It is not made up. The story is the real story of the real lives of two men, two marines, a father and a son who fought many battles both literally hand metaphorically and who did their best to fight and win and who we can both learn a lot from, but we can only learn if we listen. We can only learn if we study and we can only learn if we remember what these men went through, what they did, how they lived

Speaker 2:          00:03:37       and how they died.

Speaker 1:          00:03:42       I will begin the story with the father. He is the most famous marine in the history of the Marine Corps. He is one of the most highly decorated men in American military history. He's the only man ever awarded five Navy crosses. His name is Louis Polar, better known as chesty puller and he is to most marines the ultimate marine, the godfather of the Marine Corps. To this day, the mascot of the Marine Corps, which is a bulldog, that bulldog is named chesty after chesty puller. They're currently on bulldog number 15 named chesty the 15th in bootcamp in Marine Corps boot camp recruits sing good night chesty at the end of a long day he is embedded in the fiber of the Marine Corps. Then you might wonder who was this man and how did he become an icon to a group that is one of the most elite fighting forces in the history of mankind, the United States Marine Corps. In order to find out who this man is, we are going to explore a book called Marine, the life of chesty puller written by Burke Davis and I will go to the book. Louis Burwell Puller was born June 26 to 1898 into a small boys paradise, the village of West Point Virginia.

Speaker 1:          00:05:49       We're the [inaudible] monkey and patrimony rivers form the Broad York. The waters were full of fish, crab and oysters, and the woodlands teamed with game. Sounds like a good place to grow up. He often talked to his dream of going to the Virginia Military Institute and becoming a soldier from his reading, his family traditions, his love of hunting, fishing and horseback riding. He was drawn to military life and Vmi. 50 years later at the end of a fighting career, he would look back to those days and say, I learned more in the woods hunting and stalking about the actual art of war than I ever learned any school of any kind.

Speaker 2:          00:06:37       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:37       Those days in the woods as a kid saved my life many a time in combat.

Speaker 2:          00:06:43       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       so he wanted to go in the military from a very young age, and of course I always have to mention that I'm going to go very rapidly through this book. It may take a while, but I'm skipping huge parts and trying to hit the highlights, but to get the full information, obviously you need to get the book and read it yourself. It's a fantastic book. Back to the book, his effort, his efforts at translating Caesar.

Speaker 2:          00:07:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:15       Made him inpatient.

Speaker 2:          00:07:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:17       For the true message of the soldier author. He was so fascinated by the narrative of war that he devoured it in one night. It opened a world, a new world for him and began a lifelong career of serious military reading. It's a common theme we see with great military leaders. They read all the time and it started for him at a young age when he was translating Caesar.

Speaker 2:          00:07:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:42       He was captain of the track team. It's champion Hi Trumper and ran well in the 100 to 20 and 440 yard dashes. So he was fairly athletic. Calvo he's not a big guy. He was not a big guy when you see pictures up and he was pretty, he was relatively small in stature and he was also relatively, you know, he wasn't like a bulked up guy. They and their stories on why they called him chesty. The predominant story is, even though he was small, when he would march in, uh, on the parade ground, he would stick his chest out. So they called them chesty puller back to the book in the last week of high school in 1917 the senior class played hooky one day on the theory, which proved to be correct that the principal would not dare expel them all. Louis was the leader of this prank and when they returned from a swim and a six mile hike to the river, he helped to bring back a dozen or more bull frogs and paperbacks.

Speaker 1:          00:08:39       Lewis and Dave field toss the frogs into a school room window and we're rewarded by screams and other sounds of pandemonium. So He's, you know, I had to tell at least one of those stories that he was a mischievous kid. You know, a little bit of a rebel. He enrolled, he did graduate, enrolled in the military at it Virginia Military Institute. And back to the book, Lewis was promoted to Cadet Corp at the end of the year. Academically he stood 177 out of 233 cadets. So, well, not like the front runner in the class. His subject standings in his class, mathematics 200th English 149th German, 130 eighth history a hundred and second and most significantly military science 89th he had no demerits for the year and almost unheard of records, so academically not exactly crushing it, but military bearing and whatnot. No demerits. He was doing well. Now this is where things start to get a little bit interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:09:44       Obviously is 1917 so we've got world war one is going on and here we go. Back to book. His chief disappointment was that they were soldiers without arms for the rifles were taken by the army as the war in Europe, a war on and ammunition had been too scarce for target practice. With that, he said, I'm going to enlist in the marines. He said, I don't want the war to end without me. I'm going with the rifles if they need them, they need me to. On June 27th the day after his 20th birthday, Louis took the train to Richmond and enlisted in the Marine Corps bound for boot camp at Paris island, South Carolina. So wasn't going to sit around and let that water run out on him.

Speaker 1:          00:10:34       Shows up for his a bootcamp. There's a drill instructor. Uh, one of the great things about this book is the guy that wrote the book of Burke Davis. He not only sat down and interviewed chesty puller for hundreds of hours, he also went and interviewed all kinds of people that interacted with Chester chesty poler during his career, which he interacted with a lot of people cause he was in the Marine Corps for a really long time, for decades. And so the book has all kinds of research and all kinds of interviews. And one of the people that got interviewed was the drill instructor, one of the drill instructors that put chesty puller through bootcamp drill instructor. Uh, I think it was a gunnery Sergeant Desk Bari. And he said, by God, he's a marine. He looks as if as if he must sleep at attention. You always know, I have to tell him to look mean and nasty out there marching. But I never had to tell him. He's a natural, he never makes the same mistake twice. And he talked about, he talked about polars military history knowledge. He said, hell, he gives me an inferiority complex. I've read some, but that kid knows von Clausewitz backwards and guys, guys I never heard of by the dozen. He's some kid. This stuff is like a religion with him.

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:11:55       so that's, that's real stuff right there. You know we hear General Maddis talk about that too. I had general Madison never gets surprised because he's read it before. Not going to surprise me because I already know, I already seen this situation before. Maybe not exact, but I at least have an idea of it. The non coms admired polars work on the bayonet field where big signs raid advanced to kill.

Speaker 3:          00:12:21       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:21       For two months the class went through intensive drills in the bay bayonet, that rifle boxing, judo and infantry drill. So back in the day, they're still getting after and a boxing and judo by the way, is a good combination, very good combination. You get your take downs, you get your grappling and you get some striking. One day the men were told that their orders had come and they were packed to leave for Hoboken New Jersey to ship out for France.

Speaker 3:          00:12:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:48       Being meaning they were going to war. The move was postponed for several days until armistice day canceled the orders. So the end of the war came. He was detached and sent to the third officer's training school, so they took him and said, you know what, you did so good in bootcamp. The war's over, we don't have orders. We're going to send you to be an officer. Back to the book, He became a second lieutenant on June 4th two weeks later when he had finished machine gun school, the end of the war brought a huge cut in the marine corps on June 16th polar was discharged with hundreds of others of his rank and he was at loose ends. He'd been a marine officer for two weeks.

Speaker 3:          00:13:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:31       Now as he's kind of processing out, he met a guy named Captain Route Curtis at the Marine Corps headquarters and this is what the advice he gave him. You know, he sees this young hard charger and says, if I were you, I'd go down to Haiti. You'll get commissions in the, in the constabulary down there and they need good men and there's plenty of fighting. You'd see action and have some fun. So at this point in Haiti, they had basically built this, uh, this, it's, it should, John Dahl has, where's gendarmerie is what they call it, but it's a military force.

Speaker 3:          00:14:10       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:11       That also does police work kind of. So, and there was a, there was a revolution in Haiti. There were issues in Haiti. And so America actually invaded Haiti in 1915 and now they had established this forced to keep things under control. And the way they did it, it was run, they took the, the locals and they put, basically hired former marines to be in charge of them. And then the goal was as the locals, the, the native Haitians w started to understand military operations and they would get promoted and the American marines and soldiers could go home. That was the plan. So let's see. Um, kind of just covered this, but Haiti was strife, was the strife of war torn western tip of the island, shared with Dominican Republic. Revolutions had been shaking the government since 1914 after almost a century of freedom from France since 1916 at the request of the Haitian government, marines had police the country I made violence, which had taken nearly 2000 lives, almost all Haitian General Smedley, Smedley Butler who will get to sometime on this podcast had created the John Dahl, Marie the Haiti with a straw with a shrewd disregard for precedent.

Speaker 1:          00:15:29       The senior officers where US Marine officers whose brief tours of two years created a supply of field trained commanders. But he chose the marine enlisted men to act as junior officers and allowed them to stay as long as they wish on the theory that they became more valuable as they learned the language and customs of the people in practice. It was these marines, these marines enlisted men who operated the force

Speaker 1:          00:15:54       under them were many native soldiers, most of them veterans of the old Haitian army. And from this pool, they were drawn second lieutenants and sergeants and corporals. So that's what you have. That's the situation. So he deploys down there, he's not really in the Marine Corps is a hired hand basically. Um, so now he's there, not for very long and back to the book about 4:00 PM without warning. Louis stumbled into the first fight of his career, improved his instinct for combat, the pack train, this is a group, he was moving the, a group of people through the woods. The packed train was ambling around a wooded bet bend between hills, which were littered with stones and cactus when in met an oncoming Keiko band. This is the, the revolutionaries, I guess you call them the [inaudible] band of about a hundred equally surprised. And at the end in the same formation, polar sport has spurred his horse and yelled charge, attack the column, charged horses, pack meals and all. And in the funder and dust, fierce gels of the cake goes broke for the hills firing a few stray rounds. So that was kind of his first combat experience. You got to bring that up.

Speaker 3:          00:17:01       Uh, but

Speaker 1:          00:17:04       he was default aggressive even in an logistics movement. You know, they've got a bunch of pack horses and he's like, oh charge.

Speaker 3:          00:17:14       And it worked

Speaker 1:          00:17:17       back to the book. Another situation that he gets into from the opposite shore, a native and Dominican dress rode out on a magnificent horse, a big buck skin with white mane and tail who splashed through the shallows under perfect control though, without a bridle or saddle, a wonderful horse. Polar said, I'd surely like to have him.

Speaker 1:          00:17:38       Bruno, who's one of the guys, one of the natives that that was working under him moderate and creole and a rifle cracked polar saw one of his men pull his rifle bolt back and reject a cartridge. The beautiful horse stood in the river looking nervous about his rider floated down the stream in a stain of blood. The stunned polar turned to Bruno. Did you order that man shot? Hell Sir. You said you wanted the horse. Anything the captain says is our command. We have discipline here sir. The man seemed unmoved by the cold blooded killing my God. Catch the horse, get the men over the river. And see if you can find that man's family. And this, the reason I pulled this out is this line right here, Lewis never again expressed himself. I'd lead before these soldiers. So that's, that's a crazy story, right?

Speaker 1:          00:18:31       He says all that's a beautiful horse. I'd love to have that horse. And they kill the horse riders. Just a civilian. But he realized the power that you have in command. And there's sometimes when people don't realize that people don't realize how I run into that with business leaders. They'll walk around, all this is this is crap and everyone thinks it's crap then or you know, do you got to realize that your words have meaning. And when you're in a senior position, your words have power. And so that was how he learned that listen to in a very horrible way, back to the book company aid weighted the Stream without opposition. But as they mounted the rich beyond a rifle fired and there was a terrifying shriek of a boat overhead. Polar duct. Lieutenant Lee was at his side and said, Captain Polar Officers do not flinch under fire. They stand, the men take note of this thing. It is of first importance. So he's going to get plenty of exercise in that and you'll see he becomes well known for never flinching again under fire.

Speaker 1:          00:19:36       Here's something about the people they were fighting these Keiko bandits. They carry off everybody and every wounded man and when they catch our wounded, well captain, if you see one, you'll never forget the Kaikos believe every man who dies must go before the gods and they use their knives to see that when our men go, they are beyond recognition. They slashed the face to ribbons and tear of the body apart. You will see captain, it's a matter of life or death for the officers and noncommissioned officers here to respect, to have respect from the men and something more adulation. They must obey orders to the letter. Without question though, they die for it. It was the only way to handle men in combat. If you lose control, you lose lives. It is as simple as that. So there you see the super strict discipline that they're into.

Speaker 1:          00:20:26       And this is something that you're going to see this theme throughout the book that chesty has this, this reputation which is earned of being super hard core. But also in the book you're gonna see over and over again that there's a huge dichotomy that he's super hardcore, but at the same time he knows when he needs to give people slack. He knows when he needs to be a positive reinforcement instead of a negative one. And his rep is reputation, doesn't have that. But that line right there like, hey, they just need to do whatever you say. He doesn't even believe that, but it's, it's pointed out. And so I brought it up because the contradiction becomes pretty clear or not the contradiction, but the dichotomy is very clear throughout this book.

Speaker 1:          00:21:09       So back to the book General John, a lagoon commandant of the corps had come to Haiti on inspection and Louis was anxious to see the hero of the fighting in France. And Camp Lejune isn't called Camp Lajune for nothing. And at this point a marine patrol filed pass. And this is a good another, another good lesson. They were unshaven and ill kempt I'm afraid to, men are a little ragged and out of uniform sir. And the company commander Clinton said, I'm trying to improve them. Colonel, I'm a field soldier. Lazoon said, I don't give a damn what men look like in the field. The only one thing interests me and that's ending this war. Don't waste your time shining them up for jungle work. Our only objective is success and I demand that. So there's a contradiction right there. Like we'll not a contradiction, but there's the dichotomy and he's hearing it from now on.

Speaker 1:          00:22:05       The other side is here in this room from a general the June who's saying, look, I don't care what these guys look like in the field. You don't need to polish them up. They need to when they need to be fighting. And chesty puller becomes very famous for the way he appears sometimes in the field. Meaning he's not exactly spit and Polish out there. He was awarded the medal military air of the Republic of Haiti and he did not go unnoticed by his superiors. And early in 1921 he was a recommended for a permanent commission in the Marine Corps, whereas rank was now that have sergeant, he served as a judge adjutant to Colonel Vandergriff. This is another famous marine. He again became a second lieutenant US Marine Corps, but this time as irregular, I may not have much else to go on. He told a friend, but I have some perseverance.

Speaker 1:          00:23:02       He had fought in 40 actions in Haiti. He developed his instinct. He developed his instinct of talent for using terrain and battle and learn the lessons of jungle fighting. He becomes strongly prejudiced against barracks and headquarters soldiers. Despite his youth. He was one of the most combat seasoned combat officers into core. So he got noticed because he did well in combat. He eventually gets, gets up, hired on into the Marine Corps as a sergeant and then very quickly thereafter goes back to the officer ranks after he's working for our colonel Vandergriff. So there you go. And you can see he develops this prejudice against barracks and headquarters soldiers. Rear Echelon is what we call them

Speaker 1:          00:23:50       now. After he came back to the states, he gets chosen to run the the Marine Corps drill team who has apparently competing and they hadn't been winning against the navy and the army and the coast guard teams. They've, they've been beating them and so he takes over. So here we go. Private Bob Nourish a company clerk drafted for the detachment, shared the astonishment of his mates. The lieutenant told us the first day that we would bring home the cop or die trying and from the cold I, he gave us, we believed it. We found out. We found we weren't mistaken. He took, he took out the silent drill manual and started this from scratch. He drove us day after day until we figured we'd never lived to see Boston when he was through with us. We literally thought as if we had one head instead of 80 yet somehow though he was hard as nails, he could be as friendly. You can be friendly with us like no other officer we'd ever seen. We gave them all we had. So there you go. Driving people hard, but they love him and they love him because he treats them with respect and he's nice to him. And that's the dichotomy and he f he knows instinctively how to walk that line and that dichotomy. Leadership

Speaker 1:          00:24:59       back to the book a few weeks afterwards, polar was whisked off to his next duty station assigned as a flying cadet in Pensacola, Florida, a chance which he had been pleading since its first flights and he improvised Jenny bomber hatery. So I didn't cover this part in the book, but when he was in Haiti he did like flights and dropped grenades on enemy locations and he was into it and he gets down to Pensacola and fails his two solo tests and he left Pensacola disappointed and interestingly three years after he, after this happened, he tried to reapply. And this is an interesting comment, the medical board in Washington in answer to his plea for one more chance, found him physically fit to fly but not temperamentally adapted for aviation training. So That's interesting. You know that this guy who's obviously a great combat leaders, didn't have whatever the whatever they were looking for for flying. He didn't have it and he made multiple attempts.

Speaker 3:          00:26:05       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:26:06       When he went back home for a little while, he went to a dance and there's some sort of interesting fact that that's the way they did it. Back in the day, you know, hey, we're going to go to a dance, and he met a woman named Virginia Evans. He dance with her three times with fumbling attempts at conversation during the next dance. He made up his mind. His manner became assured, will you marry me? She laughed. Heavens no. How can I do that when I haven't even finished the school? You will. He spent the night in the stag line watching and dancing her. She noticed that he danced with no other girl after that meeting. He did not see her again for almost 11 years, but he never lifted the long range seat,

Speaker 1:          00:26:55       gets his mind committed to something in Virginia. Evans was what he was committed to. He gets shipped off to Hawaii in July of 1926 when he shows up there. Another interesting story, Louis held firm discipline and its company and some men were probably resentful until they learned that he spared himself less than he did others. He was ruthless with violators of safety precautions where firearms were involved and every time a man shot a weapon on the base without good reason, the fine was automatically $20 one day on inspection, polar saw a 45 in the guard house, picked it up, release the clip and pulled the slide and the trigger. The gun fired unexpectedly in a bullet, furrowed into the ceiling. Chesty Puller had an AED, an accidental discharge.

Speaker 1:          00:27:43       Though he had taken all the precautions except to look in the firing chamber, polar find himself $100 which he gave to the guards to buy beer for liberty party. He bombarded headquarters with pleased to send them to Nicaragua where war had broken out and marines. We're trying to put down a native bandit uprising, so wars going on in Nicaragua and he says, Hey, send me down there. Back to the book. Nicaragua adds even more rugged than hated than Haiti. The Green Rolling Country of jungle and planes dominated by towering highlands upon which we're tumbled. Mountain masses. For many years, revolutions had torn the land despite the presence of US Marines. And now a bitter new war had called them back after a year. His absence in the north lay at unconquered Indian empire whose people did not recognize the central government and there where he moved back and forth across the border of Honduras was the rebel chief. Augustus Augusto Caesar Sandino.

Speaker 3:          00:28:43       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:28:44       So that's what's going on in Nicaragua.

Speaker 3:          00:28:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:48       Chesty poler shows up, reported to general e are beetle, and he says, I'll give you a company up in the Sago vs in the north. I understand you like to mix it up.

Speaker 3:          00:29:00       Big Mix up, big, mix it up.

Speaker 1:          00:29:04       So this is, again, you know this, there's so many things that he does that just build this incredible reputation that he ends up with. And here's one of them. The native Voss with a f was a fire eating brigand who had been appointed as the local HEFY. Half a politico

Speaker 1:          00:29:25       holler invaded his office, accompanied by a sergeant and in brief words told the terrorists that he would, that he had come to restore order and that trouble trouble makers would be, would fare badly. He ended quietly. You will be held responsible for any further disorder with your life. As he talked, he saw partially open drawer in the desk before the chief and the bow of a revolver. The boss looked as if he wanted to snatch the pistol. Go ahead. Polar said, use it if you can. We'll settle this once and for all. You'd better be fast.

Speaker 2:          00:30:00       Like

Speaker 1:          00:30:01       who does that? I'll tell you who does that chesty puller. Does that pull polars career as a guerrilla fighter now opened in earnest in February, 1930 he was ordered to clear bandits from the area of San Antonio. Bill Lee, who had earlier served three years in Nicaragua, had been pleading for a chance to return. Lee was a tall, muscular athlete from Massachusetts who had been 16 years and the corn was conditioned by years of playing fullback on the team, have a coal burning coal burning battleship and by boxing and pulling an oar on a crew puller, unhesitatingly chose him to help direct company m and Lee and Lewis found and Lee found Lewis an ideal commander. This is, this is classic. He, this is what Lee says about his commander, which is chesty puller. He never really gave me orders. He just told me what headquarters wanted, asked me if I knew the country and to get up the men we needed. He was a common sense officer and you always knew where you stood with him when he was displeased about something I'd done. He never chewed me out as so many inexperienced officers would have done. He would say, if I had been doing that, I'd have done it this way.

Speaker 2:          00:31:17       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:31:18       and that would be the end of it. We got all my brothers most important of all. He was not green. When he first came to Nicaragua, Haiti had taught them jungle fighting and he took the to the new country like a native. That paragraph right there is just, it's so important, especially again, when people get the image of a marine and of chesty puller that he's just going to whip everyone into shape. Like no, that's not a good leader. That is not a good leader.

Speaker 1:          00:31:50       Back to the book, General Magee Mcdougal recommended polar for a navy cross citing five fights against, so this is after he's been there for a little sighting, five fights and get superior numbers without loss to himself. The nine known enemy dead and numerous but uncounted wounded and the impressive loot of munitions, an animal's food and captured military dispatches. The recommendation ended ended thus by his intelligent and forceful leadership without thought of his own personal safety by great physical exertion and by suffering many hardships. He surmounted all obstacles and dealt five successive and severe blows against organized banditry and the Republic of Nicaragua. So there you go. That's what he's getting after down in Nicaragua. Here's a another captain, he Lindsey [inaudible], who was the intelligence officer in the, in the marine brigade. He saw that some of the people were jealous, so he, so he started getting a little bit famous.

Speaker 1:          00:32:52       People started writing about them. There was an article in the New York Times about them and people started having some professional jealousy back to the book. This is Lynn sat talking now and then from New York Times now and then the New York Times got some of these stories from Nicaraguan papers and polars name became widely known. A few officers around headquarters who thought of themselves as clouds of types, muttered criticisms of polar and said he was a publicity hound. I knew that the opposite was true and that Louis spent virtually his whole life in this period on the trail deepened enemy country. While our staff officer friends, sob sat on their duffs in the cities far removed from the warfare, but you get that professional jealousy. There's a classic example of it. Here's a General Julien Smith talking about Louis Polar. He was probably the bravest man I ever knew. His was a cool courage. Not One of desperation about the only way to contact the enemy there was to let them ambush him. He would go anywhere without support knowing that if he got in a jam, he had to get himself out. He never hesitated. He invited that kind of work. He's getting after it.

Speaker 1:          00:34:09       Uh, he went home for a little while. He visited his younger brother, Sam, who is also a second lieutenant in the marine corps, and then polar landed in one of the army infantry schools. The armature, he army's infantry school. He went to that school while he was there, sometimes had some disagreements with the staff. Here's one. One lecturer told the students that volume of fire in the field was more important than accuracy that brought polar to his feet. You must have forgotten what happened in the American revolution. He said, we won that war with accurate fire. When the enemy had all the volume it wanted king's mountain and Saratoga and every other battle we won, and real shooting almost whipped the mass firing federal army in the civil war. It's still like that anywhere. I've seen men shooting it out. You don't hurt them if you don't hit him.

Speaker 1:          00:35:12       Great Point. Even though suppressive fires, awesome and massive volume of fire, definitely. We'll keep the enemy down. Heads down. You got to hit him. That's, you know I've talked about this before but that's like why in Ramadi our machine gunners were putting, put, putting scopes on their machine guns, which is, I mean they're part of partially doing it for to be able to identify who they were looking at positively identify enemy looking for weapons cause you've got a little magnification on your scope. But still they also wanted to like hit what they were shooting at. Obviously our snipers riflemen were doing that too. But yeah, you got to hit what's your, you got to hit so you got to hit the bad guys.

Speaker 3:          00:35:49       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:35:49       Back to the book. And as he was at Ben, he was at that school at, at Fort Benning, Louis left bending with many new friends and all services. But most important carried away a distrust of overscheduling military men.

Speaker 1:          00:36:02       Here's polar talking. The trouble with this school business is that we've taken it too far. We sit around in classrooms and we'll, the conditions of battle, of course, an actual battle. You can't, we'll anything, not a damn thing, because the enemy will do what you don't want him to do or expect them to do almost every time. Then the results of actual warfare studied back in the schools, the staff officers and planners most in most of whom have never seen real battles. Wonder what went wrong with their neat plants. You just simply cannot learn warfare in a school room or anywhere else except in combat, and you'll never know whether you're a fighting man until you're under fire. Yeah, he goes back to Nicaragua after that.

Speaker 3:          00:36:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:59       Back to the book. Throughout the latter half of 1932 company M was on unceasing patrol, averaging 18 to 20 miles daily on the mountain trails, stretching it some days too, as much as 40 miles polar and Lee and their troops marched more than 10,000 miles in the Nicaragua fighting always on foot for the early discovered that horseman drew fire in every skirmish, and so they walked without the mark of officer on their uniforms.

Speaker 3:          00:37:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:30       10,000 miles.

Speaker 3:          00:37:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:34       On schedule on January 20 on January 2nd, 1933 the marines began leaving Nicaragua.

Speaker 3:          00:37:42       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:37:42       In February, 1933

Speaker 3:          00:37:46       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:47       Louis was introduced to military society and peaking

Speaker 3:          00:37:52       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:52       At the u s legation, his commander pinned on his chest, the Star for the navy cross you'd want to Nicaragua. So he, he won another navy cross. Less than a month later he took over the Horse Marines. Louis discovered that the 600 man, u s marine battalion held only one field exercise each week and this was called off in extreme heat or cold or a dust storm,

Speaker 1:          00:38:19       but that the Japanese did not cancel their training marches for any reason. He put his horse marines through their paces daily, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, leading them on long cross country rides with small dust storms boiling in their wake. He wrote into areas where Japanese, we're training in an effort to observe their details and our tactical work. So he came home and take over and we're just going to tighten things up a little bit. One training exercise a month? No, daily. We're switching to daily. Back to the book. Lewis never forgot Virginia Evans. That was the girl from the dance and faithfully wrote her of his experiences in China. In one letter, he wrote so emphatically that you could almost see him blurting out the words he wanted to hear. He wanted to say to her, but dear, even if you do marry me and make me a happy man, even then, if I hear the beat of the drum, I must leave you. I want you to know that she's not even married to him yet. She's not even married to him yet. And he's like, Hey, you know, that's great if you marry me and make me happy, man, that's awesome. But if I hear that beat of the drum, I'm out going to do what I gotta do.

Speaker 3:          00:39:34       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:39:36       here's another he, he got in trouble. He got in trouble a lot because he didn't hold his tongue and you're supposed to hold your tongue, right? And he did. That's why so many people loved him. It's also why he got professional jealousy and it's also why he got in trouble sometimes. Here's one example. Example. Polar was aware of some American military errors on board the Augusta and he never failed to expose them and talks with his, with his intimates. Here we have a 10,000 ton heavy cruiser with about 800 men aboard just one on the Asiatic station. The British have three cruisers on duty here. You ever notice that we have 37 typewriters on this ship? The British have just one machine on each of their cruisers. Why do you suppose that is? You know damn well they don't read all those reports back in Washington when they get their paperwork will ruin any military force. They should have learned that from Smedley Butler. They'll shed this monstrosity when war comes though. And the fighting people will take over. So he doesn't like the paperwork. He doesn't eat any. You can see he does. The people that haven't fought, that's who he's talking about. People that don't fight, they're the people that create paperwork cause they don't understand how negative and affects everyone. So they create this stupid paperwork and he ends up going to the basic school, which is like the officer where the officers sort of get trained in all the fundamental principles of combat.

Speaker 3:          00:41:20       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:41:22       For the Marine Corps. And he ended up being an instructor there. Here we go. Back to the book. This is coming from a guy named Lou. Walt polar was my commander and to me was the epitome of what the Murray of what Marine Corps training should do. Not only in weapons or classroom or field training. He gave us everything hard at every break in the field though he drove us until our tongues were hanging out. Men still gathered around him. He told us tales about fighting in Haiti and Nicaragua of this patrols living off the land and fighting natives. All his experiences, not just guff. Every tail had some point. Being under polar in basic school did more for me than anything I experienced until I got to Guadalcanal. He taught us use of terrain, like a master, how to use the tiniest bit of covered it to our advantage. Ground form really meant something when he explained it. He taught us to use the Bayer net with all the tricks of close in fighting. You couldn't mistake it. He knew his stuff cold. So again, classic example of when People Think, Oh, if I'm nicer and I take it easy on the truth, they'll like me more like wrong answer.

Speaker 3:          00:42:35       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:42:37       Wrong answer.

Speaker 1:          00:42:41       Back to the book on a freezing rain swept day just before polars marriage, the class of 1937 it had an uncomfortable experience with him on the drill field they wore nor no overcoats as they marched. Teeth shattered, but the ranks moved with precision. Lewis saw stray glances at the barracks detachment, which came out for a brief drill wrapped and heavy overcoats and then disappeared. Those our barracks marines, he said with a z with an edge in his voice, your fighting marines being completed, the full schedule for the day, chilled to the bone and soaking wet. So legit, that's it's solid yet.

Speaker 1:          00:43:26       And he got married and here we go. The pullers left the pleasant life of Philadelphia Navy Yard in the spring of 1939 nine bound for the Orient. They had a few days in Hawaii and went to Waikiki one morning to ride surfboards with another young friend, Lieutenant Gordon Warner, a champion swimmer who had studied under Louis at the basic school. The two men went out to see in a canoe and to Virginia's astonishment, Lewis road in with Wagner balancing with his balancing with skill as rollers. Harold them towards the shore. Lewis then returned and rode in on a surf board alone and turned to Virginia. Come on, you're going to try it too. You never had so much fun chesty puller getting some of that stoke. Awesome. I just had to bring that out, right. Even chesty puller like there's a little bit of stoke.

Speaker 3:          00:44:21       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:44:24       Back to the book with a little further delay. Lewis got what he saw for himself. He would report to the new Marine base in North Carolina swamp lands at River where he would command the first battalion seventh marines and prepare them for war. So obviously Pearl Harbor takes place and he heads back to the states to takeover the one seven marines were the battalion returned from the field late afternoon. Polar called a conference of his company officers. Gentlemen, my name's polar, your new commander. We have a good deal of work to do together. I'll be slow to make changes, but one of them begins tomorrow at the first rest period after we leave camp camouflage every man and every piece of equipment, we've got no camouflage material. Major. Well Dude. Anyways, the best is in the field. Find a mod whole smear motto and your face is enhance twigs on helmets and blouses. Anywhere you can stick them. Pine foliage is good, you'll learn. The battalion began with marches of 12 miles daily.

Speaker 3:          00:45:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:24       This was pushed to 15 and then 20 miles. Pull her punctuated drills with fight talks to his men.

Speaker 3:          00:45:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:31       They were very young. Many of them. Beard, this boys under 16 who must have lied about their ages. They were the most obscene. The profane men polar had ever encountered. Edward L. Smith, a young battalion doctor educated at Yale and Harvard confessed that the constant flow of filthy language actually sick and him.

Speaker 3:          00:45:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:54       Now we had some guys that were marching and some of them followed fallout from the heat and he wrote it and the major polar comes by. When you were marching this morning I heard a marine or the roadside say there goes the God damn seventh regiment. I was amazed. One of you didn't step out of ranks and knock him out cold.

Speaker 3:          00:46:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:18       One of his privates, Gerald Wyatt, a Yale man from Eastport Maine, also a diarist began to take note of polar. He is never obscene. Remarkably for the vigor with which he handles us. He has toughened demands, the outmost, but there was always a kindly approach even when he is chewing you out, the displays a touching sympathy.

Speaker 3:          00:46:40       Again,

Speaker 1:          00:46:41       this is what, this is what we're trying to do as leaders. Balance that dichotomy.

Speaker 3:          00:46:45       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:46:50       Here's polar talking to his troops. One more thing. Whenever we are at Chow, the privates will be fed first. Then the non coms and officer's last of all typical taking care of the troops when they were toughing to that. Oh, this is it. When they're there. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:47:11       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:12       Doing Calisthenics and all their marches and here we go back to the book when they were tough to that polar put them through a series of night marches beginning after midnight. The doctor's like others learn to read maps and campuses and to handle weapons, including mortars. The practice of identifying ships and planes. A joke in most units became a serious business. In one seven some medics learned Morse Code and Manila, John Basel owned an army trained veteran machine gunner traded semaphore lessons for instruction and first aid.

Speaker 3:          00:47:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:45       Had to bring up that we had Manila John. It's like unbelievable man that this

Speaker 1:          00:47:53       stories are just unbelievable. Here's, here's another very cool a situation. This young lieutenant was practicing some kind of an assault and he gets a little complicated and and polars what pulled our calls. Everyone is old man. Whether they're older than him or younger, he calls everyone old man, which is pretty funny. So here we go. Paul was talking to this young lieutenant, old man, there's mighty little room for fancy tackers below division level, the enemy or on the hill. You go get them. In the end you'll save men. There are times when you will have to flank, but don't forget that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.

Speaker 3:          00:48:32       Get some.

Speaker 1:          00:48:35       I always talk about flanking and I'm a big believer, Jesse polar says, hey, sometimes you've got to flank, but sometimes you got to go get some straight line. Here's another important thing. He, there's a, there's a a colonel that's running artillery training and he goes and talks to him. Colonel, you'll be starting artillery training next week. I want you to let me know when, when your fire, I want to get my troops under it as often as I can and the colonel said there may be accidents and fuller says we can chance those. What I won't chance is taking a bunch of green kids to war before they know the sound of big guns. I know shells aren't the same going in and coming out, but this will help.

Speaker 3:          00:49:19       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:49:20       so he wanted to get down, right? They're all under the sound of the guns. Hmm. Lieutenant Cox. Now, the executive of a company was impressed by pro polars thoroughness. Major polar never stood aside and said, carry on sergeant, and most often other officers did. He was in there with us packing all. He could walk down the best of us, even the kids, other commanders, road cars in the woods, but not polar.

Speaker 3:          00:49:53       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:49:53       here's another journal entry private Gerald White wrote for his diary. Polar must've marched twice the distance we did for all day long. He kept marching up and down the column. John as a Bantam Rooster, pipe clinched in his teeth. Ever alert to see that, who to see that men who were succumbing to the heat exhaustion or blisters were taken care of by Korman many times today I saw him take a bar, which is browning automatic rifle. It's a big machine gun, a bar machine, gun or mortar off the shoulder of some marine who's Fannie was dragging and carry it to give the poor guy some respites. Here's another situation again, good dichotomy here. Somebody that he finds somebody asleep on watch, which by the way, it's like an incredibly horrible thing, which you can get severely punished for. Back to the book, polar shook the boy wake old man. It's dangerous to pull a trick like this. Suppose captain Rogers had caught you eat, made a big fuss, and then I'd have to court martial you and slap you into the brick. Maybe that's what I should do. But I'll give you another chance. Pretty soon now we'll be fighting for keeps

Speaker 1:          00:51:01       and you'll still stay awake or risk the lives of every one of us. You understand me? So I mean talk about it. Way To endear yourself to the troops. That's so awesome. Hey, if the cap mortar caught you, then would have been a big fuss. Luckily I caught you. Polar was, so they deployed overseas.

Speaker 2:          00:51:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:24       Polar was promoted to lieutenant colonel on Samoa. He wrote to his wife.

Speaker 2:          00:51:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:30       Life is so short.

Speaker 2:          00:51:32       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:33       And when I was a child, I thought it would last forever and ever.

Speaker 2:          00:51:37       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:37       My love for you will Virginia even into the next life. And then on the hardest thing that I've ever done was tell you goodbye. That was a black Tuesday and I pray they will never be another separation. Yeah, you're not right. You know they're going, they're heading into a Guadalcanal, so that's going to make everyone think life can get pretty short.

Speaker 2:          00:52:01       Hm.

Speaker 1:          00:52:02       Back to the book. Fire came from the sea where Japanese ships stood close in on challenged and battered the area. Much of the grove was cone by flying fragments and men screamed in agony. Trees were torn and broken and many tumbled to the ground.

Speaker 2:          00:52:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:18       People reported hearing general polar or at this time colonel polar. It's all right man. Stay down and they can't hurt you. This won't last forever. Tomorrow will be our turn, so they're just getting paid. Landed on the beach and they're just getting hammered with Jap from Japanese ships. Big artillery from the big naval guns.

Speaker 2:          00:52:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:41       The battalion left that left the perimeter that afternoon. A file of more than 800 men.

Speaker 2:          00:52:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:47       The tail of the battalion had hardly cleared the perimeter when there was firing ahead. Captain Hayes was near the colonel. At the moment. Every man hit the deck except Pauler.

Speaker 2:          00:52:57       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:57       We dive for the growth beside the trail, but he walked up and down the line talking as if he were on parade. He told us it was all right, and this has nothing to worry about. Just small stuff. We began to get up again. Then in there, he commanded that battalion as it never imagined it could be commanded.

Speaker 2:          00:53:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:15       The men saw what kind of man they had and the word went down the column as fast as light. We lost our fear or some of it on a grassy knoll above the tangle where the Knights Bivouac was planned. The call column met an ambush to Bob Haggerty's platoon were killed. Two of Bob Haggerty's platoon were killed and the unit broken a tiny groups leaving Haggerty without a command. He lane cover and watched polar. It was the greatest exhibition of utter disregard for Personal Safety I ever saw. He definitely, like I said, whatever that officer was in Haiti that told them, don't show fear under fire. He took that one to the bank.

Speaker 3:          00:54:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:07       Back to the book of runner. Just be this. Again, I'm jumping around just from different combat scenarios. A runner just behind polar was hit in the throat and died quickly. Everyone else hit the ground except for colonel polar. First Sergeant William Pennington retained a vivid memory of the moment. The colonel stood there and that grazing fire with that little old stump of a pipe in his face yelling be company. Second platoon in line, hear machine gun fire kicked up, dust all around me and I stayed down in that knee high Kunai grass like everyone else in the ranks. He was the only marine you could see standing on that hillside. Get this. Here we go. A grenade fell near the old man. No more than eight yards away. Captain Sat, Captain Zach Cox estimated but polar turned when he saw a company scatter and yelled, oh that damn thing ain't going off. It helped to steady the men. The grenade was a dud.

Speaker 3:          00:55:05       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:55:09       so they get done. They're kind of like a situation. First few days of fighting back to the book. Polars battalion had 24 dead and 23 wounded. The next day back into main defense line of the perimeter. He called together the battalion officer's. His voice was hard and his face on smiling. Gentlemen, at least we've all been blooded. Now, I don't want you to be mooning over our losses and feeling sorry for yourselves or taking all the blame on your shoulders. We've all got to leave this world someday. We're all in the same pickle. Then there are worse things than dying for your country. Some things about our action in the last four days, I want you to remember forever. There are some we'd all like to forget, but there'll be in your mind's eye as long as you live. I hope we've all learned something now. Take care of your men and make yourselves ready. We haven't seen anything yet. One other thing back there on the hillside at Mount Austin, I had trouble getting company officers up. I hope you saw that costs us casualties. Never do. I want to see that again in my command. I want to see officers leading. I want you to know that your leaders and not simply commanders, you cannot operate a military force in the field under these conditions with commanders alone.

Speaker 1:          00:56:31       Civilians wouldn't know what I was talking about, but you found out now that it's true, there aren't many qualities in a man, but one that is absolutely necessary in an infantry leader is stark courage. Give that idea to your men and your own way. Don't worry over the things that are done that we can no longer help concentrate on building a better combat uner unit because that's the best hope of all of us surviving. None of us could help the fact that I was the only combat train man and our outfit when we began. I was lucky enough to get the jolt when I was young. You'll come along fast and there'll be work for us. Let's be ready when our time comes. Yeah, that's, that's, that's, I haven't really heard that point, but you know what? You need to hear people talk about leaders and managers, and I've worked with companies in it and it's a good, a good sentiment, right? Hey, RP, our leaders aren't our leaders, our leaders, they're not managers. Yeah. Well this is an interesting one of say, look, it's not not commanders, leaders, not commanders, and that if you think about the difference between commander's meeting, I'm going to come in and you want to do is I'm going to lead the very, very

Speaker 3:          00:57:40       cool, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:57:43       distinction between those two words. Back to the book. He still missed nothing involving the morale of his men, Reagan Fuller, who began to feel the stark drama of the situation after the first severe fight grew a beard and swaggered around the perimeter like a desperado polar took him aside. Oh man, you're carried away with this war business. You're feeling too self important about it. That's dangerous. This is just a matter of kill or be killed. I got to read that again. This is just a matter of kill or be killed and we've got to stay on our toes to have a chance. Clean yourself up. Here's some shaving gear. And when you're through, you can take a drink from that bottle if you like.

Speaker 3:          00:58:32       Again, like

Speaker 1:          00:58:36       connecting with your troops and recognizing that a guy starting to do like go sideways a little bit and pull him aside and talking to them.

Speaker 3:          00:58:45       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:58:45       all right. Now again, they're just engaged in a fierce battle. This point back to the book at the peak of this polar had a telephone call from the regimental commander in the rear polar. We've got to change in order to execute a reconnaissance enforced. When your battalion along the coast road do not become involved in a large action, be prepared to withdraw to maintain communications. Reagan fuller was within earshot of polar as polar shouted in rage. How the hell can I make a reconnaissance when we're engaged down to the last man, we're fighting tooth and nail. Man, if you'd get off your duff and come up here where the fighting is, you could the situation.

Speaker 3:          00:59:26       Boom.

Speaker 1:          00:59:28       Again, this is why he wasn't always super popular up the chain of command because he spoke the truth sometimes in the most, not the most tactful way.

Speaker 3:          00:59:40       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:59:41       Now polars battalion actually ends up getting the upper hand there and he gets them kind of pin down in.

Speaker 3:          00:59:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:50       Crushes him back to the book when it was over the regimental headquarters called back relieving polar of any necessity of a reconnaissance patrol and permitting him to return to the perimeter. There was also a call from Hannah Akin, a request to bring back is wounded polars men carried in all casualties from the two battalion. Two Battalions Pours Battalion had five dead and 21 wounded. Total losses were 65 dead in 125 wounded for the operation. Polar estimated that the enemy losses to be at least five times that that, but it was later revealed that the Japanese fourth infantry had lost almost an entire battalion with 690 dead. The result of polar strike in the crater.

Speaker 3:          01:00:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:34       Now, like I said, he speaks his mind and remember I mentioned Colonel Vandergriff who we worked for when he was a young lieutenant, will now have a colonel. Vandergriff is a general and general Vandergriff that they're having a little conversation back to the book. The whole process was asinine. The mixed up outfits as badly as they possibly could. There was no overall commander division gave orders to skin wailing and me. Whaling was senior, but orders did not come through him. My regimental commander was behind the river and not on scene. Thus when they found two battalion stopped cold in the fight, communications were so bad. They pulled these two outfits and left me to face all the enemy. We were blind, lucky to come out as we did. Imagine them ordering me to go on some damn reconnaissance when I was fighting with every man I had.

Speaker 1:          01:01:25       Proper designation of authority would have made everything clear. Boom. There you go. Yup. Proper designation of authority. People need to know who's in charge and you need to put someone in charge. That's the way it's got to work. Hmm. When you don't have that, you get confused and you get issues. Now there's a, there's like a field doctor there. Dr. Smith noted in his diary that pullers seemed more concerned over losses. He's become almost fanatical and his desire to see that men are properly cared for. If a man's body has lost, he is greatly disturbed and frets about the time lost before he can recover the body and give it a decent burial.

Speaker 3:          01:02:10       There you go.

Speaker 1:          01:02:13       There was one on pleasant matter, a young Philadelphian who had earlier been a disciplinary problem on Samoa, had failed the colonel on the crater march, polar called Jim Hayes, the legal officer. I want you to have hers tried for dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy. He threw away his load a mortar shells because it was too heavy and he costs me the lives of several men. Damn his time. I'll draw a recommendation. I'm going to have him shot.

Speaker 2:          01:02:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:46       And I don't think I cover it. It's it. The reason I pointed that out or I covered that is cause that guy redeems himself in the future. And it's one of the times where polar says, okay, you're good. He does some incredibly brave and crazy things. All right, so here we go. Back to the book. The major Japanese attack was expected. What's expected along the Matton cow in most of the division strength was placed there. The Japanese moved to attack these positions on October 15th

Speaker 2:          01:03:19       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:19       With the second division, with a Japanese second division assigned to swing forward and live in hit the marines from the south in an area where polars men unweighted nine infantry battalion set out on this March total of 5,600 men excluding artillery and other support troops. The soldiers carried or dragged everything, even guns over the rough trails. They were late in making their attack and abandoned many guns on the trail. So the Japanese are coming in. They're coming aggressively.

Speaker 2:          01:03:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:45       A company was weaker by one platoon in the other companies for despite protests of Croner polar, there was an outpost of 46 of its men, some 3000 yards to their front, commanded by Sergeant Ralph Briggs Junar Afford Edwards, Wisconsin. These men had been out for several days to warn of an enemy approach. Colonel Polar was on the field phone during the day of digging in trying to persuade his regimental commander to have headquarters withdraw Briggs and his patrol. They're going to sacrifice those men. That's all. We don't need any bait on the hook. As you say, if they're coming, they're coming. This is foolishness to throw away that platoon and they do a great job in the mini series, the Pacific of kind of showing this and if you ever watch the Pacific, I mean just watch it, watch it about 10 times. I've probably watched it 20 times and he tries to keep them as safe as he can back to the book. All right. He said, let's get this straight. Hold your hold. Fire until you get an order from me that the outpost must get clear before we open up. If the bastards breakthrough, use the bayonet and keeps someone at every phone. Weight Puller looked at his watch. It was 10 o'clock yells, rolled, yells, rolled from the right Japanese voices shouting in English, blood for the emperor marine, you die. A marine bellowed back to hell with your goddamn emperor.

Speaker 1:          01:05:09       Sergeant Manila. John Basel owns nest of guns is about the center of c company in the middle of the line with a slight decline in his front. The enemy toward him so persistently that he covered the hill with their bodies and when the first fury of attack faded, he sent men to push down the wall of enemy bodies to clear the fire lane.

Speaker 2:          01:05:31       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:05:31       Of course, that's John Basil owned who was awarded the Medal of honor for those actions that night. Now there's a a artillery commander, a little bit to the rear named Deval and polar is asking devolve for massive artillery support because they're like going to be overrun polar called the vol. Again, give us all you've got. We're holding on by our toenails. I'll give you all your call for a polar, but God knows what will happen when this ammo we have is gone. If we don't need it now, we'll never need it. If they get through here tonight, there won't be a tomorrow.

Speaker 1:          01:06:10       That's, that's the situation that they were in. Reagan fuller called from the CP from the flank. Colonel, I'm just about running out of ammo. I've used almost three and a half units of fire. You got bayonets, haven't you fuller? Sure. Yes sir. All right. Then hang on. And the heaviest of the firing. When polar law had left the CP, regimental headquarters called for him not here, sir. The wireman said Colonel Polos Upfront, find him, get him on the phone after the crew had made several calls to the line position, pull the returned and talked to the regimental commander. If you remaining in the pit, heard Paulo's explosive reply, what do you mean what's going on? We're neck, neck deep in a firefight and I have no time standing here, both linking. If you want to find out what's going on, come up and see.

Speaker 1:          01:07:00       You know, he was that good, like he was that good that he was able to do that. You know, it's kind of like rebel and I was talking about Steve jobs a couple podcasts ago and I was like, hey look, he was a, he was not a good leader. He was abusive and he was, but he was so good at these other skills. Well he pulled her such a great leader down the chain of command and he's such a great tactician and he's so brave and so do dump dominant on the battlefield. Then he does this stuff and like basically gets away with it. Yeah. Back to the book, there was one enemy, prison prisoner, a little solid warrant officer who refused to talk when he was brought to polar. The colonel was so stunned by the insolence of the prisoner that he slapped him with the flat end of an entrenching tool. Teeth spilled from the jabs mouth, but they were false teeth. He gave no information. Even then a later prisoner talk freely with polar and polar asked him, why didn't you change your tactics when you saw you weren't breaking our line? Why don't you shift to a weaker spot that is not the Japanese way. The plan had been made. No one would have dared to change it. It must go as it is written. That's why we have decentralized command. That's the opposite of decentralized command. That's called centralized command. Here's the plan. This is what you will execute. Don't do anything different.

Speaker 1:          01:08:30       Back to the book, and this is kind of after this thing settled down. That's why they prisoners. That's why he's doing interrogation. That's why he's asking, why didn't you bring it? You know, why don't you change your tax? When you broke the line back to the book pullers, men found 250 Japanese dead inside their lines during the day. About 25 of them. Officers want a major who had committed suicide, leaving a final entry in his diary on the loss of his colors and troops.

Speaker 3:          01:08:53       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:08:53       I do not know what excuse to give. I apologize for what I have done. I'm going to return my borrowed life today with short interest. Yeah, I fought that. That was worth bringing up because you always hear about the fanaticism of the Japanese, but there you go. That's it. I apologize and I'm going to kill myself because I didn't succeed in my mission.

Speaker 3:          01:09:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:17       Polars casualty for the battle where 19 dead, 30 wounded and 12 missing two or three days later when the stench of bloated bodies in his front made his med Rach polar persuaded division to make count of the enemy casualties and bury the corpses. This burial detail counted 1,462 bodies and spent two days in the grizzly work, bulldozers, grout, Gow, tolls and covered the enemy dead and great pits. So that's incredible. Incredible that kill ratio.

Speaker 3:          01:09:52       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:09:56       The colonel washed in the river with the troops and Reagan fuller notice that even when he washed his uniforms, he stripped with the enlisted men in the river or common touch. The men liked. Fuller said though a few of the Klaus where type officers and the rear rank snickered behind his back. The men knew he was real, that he never put on an act and they loved him.

Speaker 3:          01:10:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:10:22       And again, here's the dichotomy of it. Like we know what a hard ass he is. Back to the book. Polar Shield is shielded his men from unnecessary work. A young officer who insisted that they police up the battalion area removing jap beer cans and the debris of the battle was stopped by by the colonel. Forget it. Old Man. Let the boys get in their sacks and leave them the hell alone. They're half dead from fever and fighting and they'll have to hop to it again any day now. So there you go. That's the, that's like he just nails that perfect.

Speaker 3:          01:10:59       Another

Speaker 1:          01:10:59       situation, polar was 300 to 400 yards behind the point of his column. The first salvo of Japanese fire burst just in front of him for the first time and he's a combat career spanning 23 years. His luck ran out under enemy fire. He was blown from his feet by a spray of flying metal shell fragments has torn his legs and lower body and he was bleeding freely. The field telephone was carried by a Marine Justin, his rear call headquarters old man Poehler said, I can't sir. The wire's been cut. The kernels struggled unsteadily to his feet and tried to help the communications man repair the wire as he stood an enemy sniper shot anatomy sniper shot him twice through the flesh of his arm with a small caliber bullets. He sank back to the ground sergeant Pennington and come up by now and he helped shepherd lift polar into a Poncho and get them off and get them off the ground to avoid tetanus infection. Shepherd bent over polar. Are you able to stay in command, sir? Yes, of course I am. I'll be okay. I can't leave these men. May I call for artillery fire if I can get rid of your phone working? Yes. If you know how men shoveled out a foxhole for polar and lowered him into the Poncho.

Speaker 3:          01:12:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:12:13       The telephone was placed in the hole with him and when the line was repaired he cradled the phone in one arm and talked with headquarters. Pennington listened as he discussed a mortar barrage across the river the next morning and the launching of a dawn attack. These all shot up and blown up and he's planning an attack for the morning. Shepherd called in the artillery fire shall soon burst in the thickets across the stream and the enemy was quiet for the rest of that evening. Late in the night, pull a realized that he could no longer walk and called division headquarters. I find myself unable to proceed by leading my troops. He said after it'll delay word came back major Jonsi Webber, we'll assume command of your battalion within a few hours. He's leaving the perimeter immediately, so that was, you know, he gets a

Speaker 3:          01:13:09       pulled out.

Speaker 1:          01:13:10       Going back to the book, Lieutenant Colonel Polar is being recommended by General Vandegrift for the medal of honor for leading his battalion with seven holes in him continually for 24 hours.

Speaker 3:          01:13:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:13:22       Three got recommended for the medal of honor. This did not develop with the division commander. In addition to commending polars battalion for its perimeter defense and putting in for a third navy crosswords commander also wrote, I have known Louis polar since 1919 he was one of the best combat patrol officers I knew just as he is an outstanding officer today. He did a wonderful job with his battalion on Guadalcanal and every phase of the operation I have is proud to have him as a friend, as I was glad to have him as a marine.

Speaker 1:          01:13:55       January 1st, 1943 was warm and sunny and the loading went smoothly. The gear was all stowed in the last of the First Marine Division. Troops were going a board. It was only then that they're conditioned became apparent. Men who had fought for four months in the Fallis climate and Pacific and had been shelled, bombed, or shot by snipers, almost constantly between battles seem to collapse. At the same moment, scores were unable to climb the nets into the ships and had to be carried a board. They had shocked expressions with glazed sunken eyes for weeks. Most of them would be patients with malaria, dysentery, assorted fevers and fungus infections. Virtually every man in the division had malaria. By now, polar said, it isn't so much that they're sick or even worn out. It's the reaction from the discovery that they're finally leaving this damn place, and yet a lot of them grew into men here.

Speaker 2:          01:14:51       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:14:51       The divisions dead. We're 1,242 and 2,655 had been wounded. Sickness was near total.

Speaker 2:          01:15:00       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:15:01       No one could yet grasped the importance of the island fighting. On the day of loading out, the longest of the Pacific island campaigns had been fought and the pattern of future victories had been set. The Japanese had paid a higher price here then they would pay again, headed thrown all their disposal ships, planes, men and machines.

Speaker 2:          01:15:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:15:21       More than 50,000 men had been lost on the island or on the ships trying to reach it. In Japan, it was already known as the island of

Speaker 2:          01:15:30       death.

Speaker 1:          01:15:32       For more than a year, Radio Tokyo was to call the First Marine Division, the Guadalcanal butchers.

Speaker 1:          01:15:45       So that's Guadalcanal. He actually heads home and here we go. Back to the book, an aid in the office in Washington General Thomas Whole, Colm jolted in with the news. The generals given you to the army polar, I mean on loan for three or four months. General Marshall wants you to explain the Guadalcanal fighting to his troops all over the country. You need an Fred about leaving your men. The division will be in Australia for the next six months before he can get back into action. I expect you'll rejoin it in time for another big show. So there's time between these big island campaigns and he goes home to America to take over or spread the word about what the fighting was like back to the book. He often spoke three times daily. He was on and off planes until he all but lost track of his route. He told the story of his fight for the perimeter of Basil own pushing the wall of enemy bodies down the hill of burials by bold bows are in of weapons. They used, he told of patrols and thick growth, but never of his wounds.

Speaker 2:          01:16:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:16:53       I can't tell you the Japs are no damn good. He said because they are good, but we're better. One American properly trained can handle two of the yellow bastards. They have discipline and they use the jungle cover better than we do, but they can't think on their own. I'll say that again. They have discipline and they use the jungle cover better wound then we do, but they can't think on their own. That's a critical dichotomy that the discipline, which obviously obviously is something that I am

Speaker 3:          01:17:26       okay

Speaker 1:          01:17:27       passionate about. Sure. But if you put so much discipline in too much discipline in place, people don't think for themselves anymore. Yeah. They just wait. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:17:38       They never change battle plans. Once they're made, regardless of cost, they think they'd lose face. They have no artillery to compare with ours and our guns chew them to pieces. They get the jungle rot just as much as we do. They're not supermen and we'll with the hell out of them and you'll be helping to do it soon, I suppose. If you take your training seriously, then there's nothing to worry about, but you'll have to be hard and you can be hard when you write with your families to try to convince them that were in a war to the finish and then all these strikes and softness and confusion, we'll have to go.

Speaker 3:          01:18:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:18:14       I can tell you one more thing. There are worse things than dying for your country.

Speaker 3:          01:18:21       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:18:22       When he spoke to the war production board officials in Washington, here's what he said. I want to ask you why American troops shouldn't have the best, the world's best fighting equipment on Guadalcanal. We saw our trenching shovels. Break it first. Use all over. Men now have jap shovels because they're better and more dependable. JAP field glasses are better too. I have good ones myself, German glasses that I've carried for 20 years. Why should American glasses be so poor, not worth a damn and the tropics, they fog up and they are improperly sealed. Once they get damped, they're done for, I've seen hundreds of pairs tossed away in the jungle or c because men know they can see as well with the naked eye. What kind of American ingenuity or patriotism produced those

Speaker 3:          01:19:04       he doesn't play.

Speaker 1:          01:19:08       This is the little part about humility. We'll have to get over the idea that we're the greatest people on earth in every respect, that we're infallible and that no one else has ideas worth considering. One of the reasons we had to fight against the odds on Gratta Canal Guadalcanal was this insufferable American notion of superiority and our carelessness and the face of danger. It goes back to Pearl Harbor and far beyond. He's saying, you've got to stay humble. You can't be arrogant.

Speaker 3:          01:19:35       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:19:36       He was summoned before the high command of the Marine Corps and gave some gay and gave the same forthright picture of the fighting he had seen.

Speaker 1:          01:19:46       Gentlemen, we have some of the same old troubles, staff officers who've never seen combat issue, unrealistic orders that cost lives, time, money and ruin morale. For example, we were out there on that island try and trying to defend a perimeter when they waited, when they wanted to send a patrol outside the command. Never used a single regimen but sent out three mixed battalions. The logical thing would have been a regular regimen with one battalion leading the other and the other two covering officers and men will be familiar with each other and there would never be questioned about who is in command,

Speaker 1:          01:20:21       but when we did go out, it was almost always with mixed battalions. It may look good in the staff officers chart here at headquarters, but it didn't work. Brought us only stumbling and confusing and casualties more than once. When we were out in the jungle, nobody really knew who was in command. I could cite you the names of many of man I lost because of that. It was inexcusable. This is something that it absolutely is, is very important to understand, especially for guys that aren't, well I guess anybody, you, you work in your train in a certain way, as much as you can stay in the groups that you work in, train with. Right. And for them to just randomly, and who knows why they did this. But I'll tell you what I've seen. I've seen this where let's say there's some operation, uh, that's a high visibility operation that everyone thinks, wow, that'd be a cool operation to do.

Speaker 1:          01:21:18       Well, instead of just taking, let's say one company, they go, okay, well we want to get multiple different people to get to be able to be involved in this operation. So we'll take one platoon for this company and one platoon from this other company at one platoon for this other company and we'll just send them all out there. That's exactly what he's talking about. It's like, no, no. Hey, sorry, you guys aren't going to go on this operation. We're sending Alpha Company or Bravo company or whatever. Right. That's the way you do it. Yeah. Play around. Here's a little comment because I love the machine guns. Little comment on the art of machine gunnery. These guns are the most important firepower to infantry. Just, I'm just making that statement. Tested Code Chesty Puller statement g machine guns. Go be a machine gunner.

Speaker 1:          01:22:18       You know what I'm saying? I ain't know what to say. I was so fired up one day we're at the gym and I walked in, there was some, some kid was signing up and he was not, I call him a kid. He was probably old man. 24 years old. Yeah. And so I said, hey, old man. No. And you know, I think, uh, I said, you know, I could tell you had like a high and tight. I was like, oh, are you in the military? He goes, yeah, I'm in the Marine Corps. I said, well, what are you doing? The Marine Corps? He said, machine gunner dig it. S awesome. All right.

Speaker 1:          01:22:53       Here's another, another comment. We just don't know. All we ought to know about warfare on land or sea. Just off Guadalcanal. Not long ago, we lost three cruises. Cruisers blasted down by Jap guns as they sat there sitting ducks. That's all. I'll tell you exactly why we lost him. The admiral in charge got a plain report that the JAP force was approaching at 14 knots by daylight, so we figured at this speed the enemy couldn't arrive in his waters before the next dawn. After dark. Of course, the jab stepped up their speed to 28 knots and got there, got to the scene at 3:00 AM when our men were not even at battle stations. Instead of keeping it happened like that, I'm positive and instead of keeping such thing secret, we ought to have them emblazoned on the gate at every naval station. We must not be too proud or too stupid to profit by our mistakes and God knows that we make them. Have you ever heard the term profit from our mistakes before? No, but I really like it. Yeah, I think I really like it too. Why not profit from your mistakes? It's brilliant. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:24:01       Yeah. It kind of puts it more into prison, you know, they say learn from your mistakes. Right? Yeah. Cool. But when you say products, so much more valuable.

Speaker 1:          01:24:09       Yeah. Talks a little bit about, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:24:14       well, the psychological impact of combat. I know something about the strain of combat. For five years in Nicaragua, I marched at least 20 days a month under constant threat of enemy ambushed, but it never saw those. But I never saw on those Indian troops any sign of battle fatigue or anything resembling it in the Pacific. I saw a lot of our people break down. My reaction is this, what does it matter how you're killed if you're killed in battle, why does the louder noise in a fight with heavy artillery and bombs makes such a difference? I think the difference is entirely in the mind and the preparation of men for combat

Speaker 1:          01:24:50       in Haiti actions. When I fought, the men were all picked volunteers. Professionals who are paid to fight and realize they might die in the trade. I'm sure from my own experience that it's the mental attitude I went through the worst days they had on Guadalcanal and I didn't suffer a bit. I lost some weight. But that was because we didn't get the proper food. If we make our men tof in the mind before they go to war and give them an honest idea of what war is like, we won't have so much of this trouble. Why do we have to baby them with all this crap about careers and opportunity and foreign travel. Ah, yeah. You know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          01:25:33       You know what I mean? Yeah. That makes a lot of sense there. You know, they say, I forget where I read this, but people who come back from, from war, they, they kind of differentiated like were people who were, who were in it like, you know how like JP and you and, and I just always wanted to do this to be a combat leader, to be a navy seal, to be a commando. You know, like typically people with that kind of attitude, they don't get affected by it because it's kind of like the thing where it affected less. Yeah. Generally you are

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       correct generally guys that like special operations guys that that's what they wanted to do. Yeah. There's a whole bunch of other things that play into that as well. The training, because he's talking about hard training. Well guess what? In special operations, you do get harder training, you have a tighter, uh, or you have, you have a real close relationship with all your guys and you stay together with your guys. That is helpful too. I mean, it's not any type of relationship that you have and an infantry platoon, trust me, I've seen those in Marine Corps and army of trend and military units get tight. It doesn't matter whether you're special operations or not. Uh, but the training, they step up the training, they make it really hard. That plays a role. But I think you're right is that guys that think that that's what they want to do, then that helps as well.

Speaker 1:          01:26:50       So there's a bunch of little factors, but I think what his point is like there's two, there's two points. Number one, make the training hardest. I guess there's three points. Number one, make the training hard as hell. Number two, make sure people know what to expect and don't talk to them about like the career opportunities. I just answered this question on the way of the warrior kid podcast, right? Well, I answered the question. The question was, is it fun to be a navy seal? And I answered the question, Hey, is it fun? Yes, absolutely. It's fun. That's part of it. But the other part of it is you are going to go to war and you could die and that's a harsh thing to tell a nine year old or a 10 year old, but that's exactly what you should tell a nine year old and a 10 year old because that's what you're signing up for.

Speaker 1:          01:27:38       I was, I was doing another interview recently and I told this story and I've, I've told it before, but you know, it was like the first time some woman that I had been working with a company and some woman that was her husband or something. Anyways, the woman said, you know, can you meet my son? He really wants to be a navy seal, you know, and I was, you know, I said, Oh yeah, sure. You know, who the kid was, whatever, 17 or 18 years old. He was a junior, senior in high school and he was this, you know, strapping kid who is, you know, look like a great athlete. And she wanted to bring me to lunch with him. So we went to lunch and, and it was, you know, the details of the story. I don't recall exactly, but it was basically, uh, you know, my son, he wants to be a navy seal.

Speaker 1:          01:28:25       He, he's on the swim team and he's on the track team and he played football and he just loves working out and he just, I think he'd be great. And then he just, he can do 28 pull ups and the kid's like, yeah, I love working out and across. I surf too. And I love the ocean. I love the water. And it was like cool. And, and you know, for awhile, you know, I was listening and then, you know, of course I was like, yeah, you know, that's, that sounds like, it sounds like you'd be well prepared for the physical aspects of it, but what you have to remember is that the reason you become a seal, so you can go and fight in wars and you're going to kill people and you're gonna be at the risk of dying and you're going to be at the risk of being, and that's what's going to happen to your friends, if not you and the, when I got done saying like on that sentence, the mom's face completely changed.

Speaker 1:          01:29:12       Yeah. Because it's what he's talking about right here, which is, hey, you know, it's travel and adventure and career opportunities. Like know what it is, is, is war and savagery and the worst things that you could possibly experience is what you're gonna experience. That's what you need to tell people. Yeah. Yeah. The special operations and the conclusion for what what I was reading there was people when they go in knowing and kind of how they put it, like forward leaning into, uh, the realities of a military situation. Yeah. It tends to be special operations or guys who want to do it for that reason. Not The guy who got sold on world travel. [inaudible] guy's definitely going to have a rougher time with it. And you've got to remember too, there's hundreds of, there's a massive percentage of army, infantry, marine corps, infantry. Guess what? They want to be marine corps, infantry.

Speaker 1:          01:30:07       They want to be, that's what they want to do. That they're just as passionate about that as some guy that like, cause that job, it's a little bit different, but a lot of that parts of that job are, you know, when we had Brian Stann on, we talked about this, you know, like Brian Stan was, you get to be in charge of more people. You get, it's, it's a, it's a different dynamic. But the combat leadership opportunities in and just the combat opportunities. I mean, when we were in Ramadi, yeah. Like I had the infantry in Ramadi, those guys were freaking getting after it. They were just, it was insane to watch those guys. So, yeah, I, you know, there's plenty, I mean, there's the vast majority or there's plenty of guys in the, in the regular conventional forces, they don't, they, they do just as good after combat as the, as the special operations guys do.

Speaker 1:          01:30:56       So it's more, and you know, we talked about this Peter a Tia, it was like if a guy's fractured going in, it doesn't matter if it's special operations or conventional forces or general purpose units, he's, if he's fractured going in, the war's gonna mess him up. If he's solid going in, he's going to do well. Right. So that's the determining factor. The training definitely helps the telling people the truth up front definitely helps, but you don't know what you're going to get. Yeah. And there's also plenty of guys as special operations that do have serious issues. Yeah. Yeah. And the article wasn't about like special operations, so that's not what it was about. It was more about the state of mind. I think special where I know that special operations was just like an example of some of some point that they're making. Well we talked, again, I'm referencing all these different podcasts, but when Jordan Peterson was on, we talked about like the offensive mindset, right?

Speaker 1:          01:31:47       And the morning offensive you can be generally the more psychologically comforting that is, it's, it's psychologically uncomfortable to be on the defensive. It's psychologically more comfortable to be on the offensive right there. I just get the right, yes. Cycle. Okay. Yeah. Psychologically uncomfortable to be on the defensive. Psychologically more comfortable. It's not necessarily comfortable cause you still have bad things that can happen when you're on offense, but it's definitely psychologically more comfortable. So those things play a role. You happen like to your experience or are you considered an experience? It's like I'm going to happen to this experience rather than this is going to be offensive instead of defensive. Absolutely. Kind of like when people say, hey, how life's, how's life treating you versus how are you treating life? You know that old saying. Yeah. You see what I'm saying? I'll go with it. Just go with it. Let's go ahead. Here's, here's another thing that he did. He calls out and this is very interesting and everyone that's in the military will hear this and kind of shake their head.

Speaker 1:          01:32:48       The practice of having command post exercises. Polar said though, he realized that he was treading on prominent toes in his audience. We take skeleton forces of headquarters troops and the like just a handful and go through exercises so often that we forget. We aren't simulating that we aren't simulating actual warfare. It has become so bad that even platoons are carrying out command post exercises in battle. Of course, once you set up a CP, which is a command post, you stop for all. You stop all forward motion because the commanders sit on their duffs in relative security and when you hope forward motion, you get in trouble immediately. I have to admit, we have to learn. I admit we have to learn how to handle commands, but we've carried it to a ridiculous extreme.

Speaker 1:          01:33:37       They do a lot of that command exercises. W the, the most unrealistic thing about it is like he's saying that you'll have not a real platoon but like a small representation of a platoon so the commander can move that platoon around real easily. Cause it's this little thing. But then when you have a real platoon that takes real vehicles in real, you know, it's like moving pieces on a board as opposed to like when you move this, this battalion from here to there, it all you do is just move this move there, move there, piece on a board. That was real easy. Yeah. You look at what actually happens in the field when you move that piece of looking battalion and it's massive. It's Ha, it's this incredible project to make it happen. Yeah. To move a battalion, you know, four miles or two miles or whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:34:26       It's like, well this is what it's going to take. Fuel and food and ammunition and wounded and planning all this stuff. But the person up top just cause oh yeah, we'll just make that Italian leather. One morning as he approached the company of his men, lounging among their tents, a newly arrived lieutenant barked an order and the marine scrambled to their feet standing at attention. What the Hell's wrong with you? Pull a roared. Don't you think I've got more sense than demand that you put on a show? Every time I come within pistol range, get back down on your ducts. You ought to know me well enough that I'm no bandbox soldier. Take it easy. There's enough for you to do when we get to our next assignment. Again, dichotomy is that okay? You don't need to snap to attention. Every time I come around, there's an army quartermaster and the general showed up and they had asked for a bunch of shotgun shells. Here we go. Back to the book. He's asked for 10,000 brass buck shot shells. What the devil it is you want with those to kill jabs with sir. It doesn't. Colonel Polar know that buck shot is prohibited by the Geneva Convention. Sir Colonel Polar doesn't give a damn about the Geneva convention any more than the Japs did at Pearl Harbor.

Speaker 2:          01:35:41       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:35:43       Now as they're getting ready to go and assault, um, Gloucester, the enemy had word of the coming assault radio, Tokyo blared one afternoon in late December, the first American Marine Division assorted cutthroats degenerates and jail birds has been chased out of Melbourne, is now in camp in New Guinea and we'll try to invade Cape Gloucester. I'm pleased to add that our soldiers are fully prepared to repulse the, since little attempt the jungles, we'll run red with the blood of the Guadalcanal butchers. So that's, that's, that's the propaganda cut throats degenerates in jail birds. So now they're going to Gloucester, Cape Gloucester. On the early morning of December 26th, they stood off Cape Gloucester. Big Guns on the fleet rolled for a half for an hour and a half, beginning before dawn or the marines and their traditional d day, Bruh eight, their traditional DDA breakfast of steak and eggs while solve those, shook the halls beneath them. Third Battalion Seventh Marines landed first quickly followed by polars old battalion, which floundered through a morass behind of the beach and pushed up the tall knoll already known to aviators and ship gunners as target hill.

Speaker 1:          01:36:57       An hour after the seventh was a shore, the first marines came turn toward the airfield and walked into a well laid Japanese Sam Bush tanks. Big tanks came into clear the enemy from there, hidden bunkers and by nightfall the first was well on its way to the airfield, a falling tree in a soggy forest, injured one marine and otherwise there were only 20 killed and 22 wounded on d day. Enemies. Casualties were estimated at 50 on December 30th the first and fifth secured the field after hand to hand fighting in which they had to call on tanks for help.

Speaker 2:          01:37:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:37:32       Once sergeant remembered a moment from a mortar attack by the enemy, a kid sitting there and his foxhole, he didn't have any head, he just had a neck with dog tags on it. A great face. Youngster nearby was muttering as he fled, as he fired his rifle, it don't do any good. I got three of them, but it don't do any good. Japanese snipers had infiltrated the line and killed marines at short range and one unit tried wade. The stream was broken. It's survivors driven to hide in the weeds on the edge from midstream. A boy who failed to make it over, hung over a log his body riddled by a score of bullets for and a half an hour or more. He called to his mates before he died, I'm here. Here I am. The attack had stalled the line and now become u shaped with a pocket of the enemy holding back the center General Rupert, us from division relieved the commander of the third battalion, seventh marines, and sent polar into action once more with orders to reorganize and drive forward the unit.

Speaker 3:          01:38:37       So

Speaker 1:          01:38:42       they weren't making any progress and the commander said, you know what, I'm putting polar beckon action. Send the wolf. The trouble was the same and here's, here's puller. Talking to his guys as he showed up, the pillow was the same old thing. The trouble was the same old thing. Staff officers don't know the meaning of terrain and how it can slowed down troops and costs lives. I went up to the front about two in the afternoon. I called the company commanders and told them as briefly as I could what I had in mind. I've been sent to take over. Your commander has been relieved. I don't intend to believe, be relieved. You can bet on that we're going to attack here in the morning. There were protests that the jap bunkers could not be seen and that they were cutting up our line. I told them I had the medicine for that.

Speaker 1:          01:39:28       I ordered up some of Joe Buckley's half tracks because I knew their guns could deal with the bunkers. The resistance was fairly light, but the staff orders were so foolish that we were just sitting targets that we're making sitting targets of our people. Buckley did a great job there as he always did. They had orders in these battalions to guide both right and left and order. That can't be followed well, even on a per ne parade ground. Any beginner knows that you can guide left or you can guide, right or even center, but you can't follow two leaders on either side. At the same time. The line will buckle and cause gaps. We were frustrating the troops with delays to reform the line. I just said, now we will go forward and forget about all this guiding business. Just forget there's anybody on the flanks. We have enough power here to drive and we're going to drive, blow your way through. Think of nothing else.

Speaker 3:          01:40:19       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:40:20       so important part there. Once again, you can't follow multiple leaders at the same time. And he's talking about a physical example like guiding in the military is when you're marching, you look to your left and you, you, you fall, you line up with the person to your left. And usually these people were saying, no lineup with a person to your left and the person to your right. How the hell are you going to do that? You'd not, that's the answer. Before the gun stopped. A staff officer from division, uh, and and

Speaker 3:          01:40:55       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:40:56       A staff officer from division went up on the line and here he says, I went up there and the heaviest of the action when fire was flying all around us, polar walked around outside the wire and hills six 60 and stopped at every, dug out to talk to some kid. He'd say, how's things going in their old man, just as if he'd come from next door to borrow a cup of sugar. Those kids thought it was the greatest thing that ever happened. You'd think you'd been handing out thousand dollar bills down the line and there was some place to spend them. Polaroid found one d moralized boy sitting stone lean his whole looking out with a telltale thousand yard stare. He murdered over and over. Colonel, we gotta get the Hell Outta here. That's no way to talk. Old Man. Polar led the boy a few paces to the rear and sat with him for 10 minutes or so. Look old, man. I want to go home too. I'm not getting any younger. Hell, I'm 45 years old. You know that I've got a family at home. I know this dump is no good, but neither of us is going home until we lick these bastards. We've got to make, we've got to help make our folks at home safe too. I'll try and get you some hot chow up here. Old Man. So again, you just got a guy that's totally gets it.

Speaker 3:          01:42:12       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:42:14       lots of heavy fighting a, they get Gloucester secured. In February, 1944 polar had a physical examination and the Cape and the camp at Cape Gloucester and aside from a notation of a recent attack of malaria was found in perfect condition. On the same day upon hearing rumor that one third of the veterans of Guadalcanal was to be rotated back to the states. Paul wrote general whole comb the commandant in terms which would have been appreciated by a Caesar or Napoleon. It is respectfully requested that my present assignment to a combat unit be extended until the downfall of the Japanese empire freaking get some.

Speaker 3:          01:42:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:42:58       The division recouped and drew replacements. The first of the new weapons began to appear in quantities. The Springfields. It almost disappeared now to pull her sorrow. He was interested in the first of a new style flame thrower. When an officer brought one by the youngster, proudly explained the work of the deadly torch and look to polar for approval. Where's the bayonet fit on it? It's another like famous quote from Chesty Puller. Here's a flame thrower, but you need to put a bayonet fitting on it. Just in case he's counseling is officers about about showing being brave and stepping up and at the same time, here's the, here's the dichotomy. He says, I don't want you to go up under the guns just for show. It's only the idiots in green kids who think they're bulletproof, but if you don't show some courage, your officers won't show it either and the kids will hang back. It's that. It's that kind of an outfit that always has trouble.

Speaker 1:          01:44:02       Next we go pull a return to Porvoo to find a new stern. The camps, the allied landings in France, we're expanding. The new [inaudible] had begun to bomb Tokyo [inaudible] panted fallen whole fleets of cargo ships had brought the first division new equipment to pursue, and there was word of an independent role for the marines in a new operation. General Macarthur would follow his own southern course on island hopping, but the core would stab into central Pacific. Polar could hardly conceive the scope of the new Marine Corps, which he had known to as a force of Amir. 19,000 is prewar days. There are now five divisions in and to brigade in the Pacific and another division in training in California. Well over 100,000 men.

Speaker 2:          01:44:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:44:47       In late July, on that same day, Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman were nominated for the coming elections back home. Marines landed on Guam.

Speaker 2:          01:44:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:44:57       A few days after Lewis got the news, Lieutenant Colonel Sam Polar had been killed. Shot through the heart by a machine gunners. Bullet.

Speaker 2:          01:45:07       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:45:08       Is intimates. Notice a new reserve in the kernel and these days, but it was not long before still another false report which added to the growing puller legend Marines whispered that when he got word of Sam's death, he had said grimly, those who live by the sword must die by the sword.

Speaker 2:          01:45:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:45:28       The loss of Sam had in fact touched Lewis' deeply. He covered it with silence and to hurry turning to other topics when officers spoke of his brother's death.

Speaker 2:          01:45:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:45:39       On [inaudible], the division intensified it's work and sweat it at war games on the beaches and in the palm groves there was a new watchword Pellalou the next target. So Yup. His brother, Lieutenant Colonel Sam Polar was killed and he got word of that.

Speaker 2:          01:46:05       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:46:06       hundred only a hundred thousand marines. That might seem like a lot, but that's, that's not a lot when you consider what the tasks that they had before them.

Speaker 2:          01:46:16       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:46:20       so now they're heading, they're heading to Pella Lu. The next target, when the big fleet left for the plows to follow the bombardment ships there was bought a single somber note aboard. One of the vessels were stacks of many hundreds of white wooden crosses far more than a two days' supply. Two days from Pellalou. There was a report from the underwater demolition teams who's met at boldly swimming to shore and inspected jap defenses. Nothing serious. They said the way would be cleared. Polars mind was not relieved. He had never before felt pessimism at the opening of a battle.

Speaker 1:          01:47:08       Now we're starting the invasion. There was no moon. The Sky was filled with stars and there was not a trace of cloud. Toward The dawn of September 15th the transports had come into position on the horizon, the guns, it's the guns of the fleet. Spurted fire. For hours the funder was unbroken, but as gray edge sky as grads, the sky pace slowed and the fire became to sultry. The island was invisible. Occasional flares erupted above it in the darkness and drifted from site. The troops had breakfast before daylight, steak and eggs again, and when the first of them came to the decks, the chain of the Palau's lay in a black silhouette across the sea. There was a moderate swell, a breeze spraying up coming from the island of Pella, Lou.

Speaker 2:          01:47:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:47:58       The guns broken to a full cry once more and the final shelling struck target. The two assault battalions of the first marines went aboard board. The big landing vehicles on the decks. The malls of the ship's clanked open in the amphibious tractors were spewed forth milling as they formed lines ready to move forward toward the breach. The beach, they were 4,000 yards out. Vast flights of planes came over wheeling in from all directions. They dived, bombed and climbed over pell Lou for an hour or more and soon after the first of the bombs fell, a slow hesitant curtain gathered over the land. It seemed impossible that anything living could have endured, but Alaska is the assault began a puff of anti aircraft smoke flowered in the sky and a plane dropped in flames just before eight 30 the first wave started short polar watch for the signal flag to dip from the yard arm of a control boat in his front.

Speaker 1:          01:48:50       The amtraks foamed away on the broad wakes at almost eight 30 precisely the vehicle ground on the sand. Polar never forgot the scene. I went up over the side as fast as I could scramble and ran my cal at least 25 yards before I hit the beach flat down. When I looked back to the Amtrak, I saw four or five shells hit it all at once. A few men were killed, getting out too slow, but most of them were saved because they got out before we stopped moving. We lost our communications officer. His leg was blown off and he couldn't be saved. I look down the beach and saw a mess. Every damn damn tracking. Our wave had been destroyed in the water by the enemy or shot to pieces. The minute it landed, I tried to get aligned, set up for defense. The wireman were there fast. As soon as I was doing their job without further orders, and we lost several of them in the hot fire,

Speaker 1:          01:49:40       every platoon leader was trying to form a line of his own. Just as I was, runners were going up and down the beaches. We tried to get organized that big PR promitory on my left hadn't been touched by all the ship's guns and planes and we got a whirlwind of machine gun and anti tank fire pullers. Second Battalion drove through a heavy growth of woods now torn by the shelling and by nine 30 had driven 350 yards ahead to the edge of the airfield. They tied on the line of the fifth marines. Casualties were reported as heavy, but the trial of the second had only begun. The new position was faced by an obstacle marked on none of the invasion maps, a sheer coral ridge who sides were honeycombed with Japanese positions from Fox holes to gigantic dug outs of reinforced steel and concrete. Some of them with four levels, each of which could be closed off with steel doors for eight hours. The regimen endured the most savage fighting of the Pacific war. General Smith had come across assured 11:30 AM when the phone line was spicy, spliced late in the afternoon and he talked with polar. He had only one. He had only a calm report were dug in solid and we've got the old one phase line. All right. Polar night made no mention of especially heavy casualties or have need for help. It was estimated that the first marines had lost 500 men during the day.

Speaker 1:          01:51:14       The first water that had come ashore, oil drums, and was foul. Polar shouted his rage to the officers on the ships bellowing for new supplies.

Speaker 3:          01:51:25       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:51:26       here's, here's polars report enemy well dug in opposition, strong little damage done by our preliminary fire. Hard fight ahead, casualties over 20% I've ordered no man to be evacuated and less from bullet or shell wounds. Request further supply. Fresh water are still on drinkable men. Retching polar called division and talked with Colonel Seldon, the chief of staff. He remembered the year, the conversation years later, Johnny, half my regimen has gone. I've got to have replacements. If I'm to carry out division orders tomorrow morning, you know we have no replacements. Louie, I told you before we came ashore that we should have at least one regiment reserve. We're not fighting a third. We're not fighting a third of the men. We brought in all these damn specialists you brought.

Speaker 3:          01:52:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:52:25       Anything wrong with your orders, Louie? No, I'm ready to go ahead, but you know my casualties or 50% what do you want me to do? Get me some of those 17,000 men on the beach. You can't have them. They're not trained in for infantry. Give them to me and by nightfall tomorrow they'll be trained. Infantry polar went out with a runner through the night to find posts of his battalion commanders and pass on the order. We press a top attack at eight o'clock in the morning. No change. Full speed. Use every man.

Speaker 2:          01:52:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:52:58       He fought, fell more than once and cut himself on the coral shepherd and others had left and others left at headquarters. Notice that the colonel was beginning to limp and that his left leg had swollen. Seldon called back. Pulled in. You got my orders. Okay. Yes, you need and explain further. I just came back from my battalions. We're going to take of ground tomorrow without replacements. We're willing to try, but don't forget, we're just going to add 10 or 15% to our casualties.

Speaker 2:          01:53:29       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:53:30       When the sun rose on September 18th 200 of the 473 men in polars third battalion were headquarters personnel. Many frontline units had been decimated long before noon. There were cases of heat prostration. The blazing sun was hotter than ever. Faces and lips were clack cracked and bleeding. Salt pills became scarce again. Polar was optimistic for they started the attack from high ground, but the crucial days still lay ahead.

Speaker 2:          01:53:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:53:57       Hank Adams came bipolars command post and found him half clad and filthy sweat soaked trousers with a heavy beard on his face.

Speaker 2:          01:54:07       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:54:08       I'm coming back this afternoon. Colonel, do you want me to bring you a a fresh uniform? Hell, Hank, I've got no time for that. Every man in the outfit will get clean before I do.

Speaker 2:          01:54:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:54:18       Re tenant, Colonel Lou Walt. Now the executive officer of the fifth marines saw polar a command conference during the day.

Speaker 2:          01:54:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:54:27       He was absolutely sick over the loss of his bed. Vietnam, he fought hand to hand until day light, beating off charges that no survivor could count.

Speaker 2:          01:54:45       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:54:46       As firstlight spilled over the ridge, the shrunken company beat back the last Japanese attack with stones, ammunition boxes, bare fists, and bayonets.

Speaker 2:          01:54:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:54:56       Several of the enemy were flung bodily off the cliff and fell shrieking in onto the splintered coral below,

Speaker 2:          01:55:12       but they did it

Speaker 1:          01:55:15       at the end of the day. The regiment reported a total of 1,878 men lost since d day. The fighting went on without a break until September 23rd when the first marines rested in lines without advancing. They beat off several counterattacks and patrols pushed out a thousand yards down the west coast without serious opposition. The regimen was relieved at 2:00 PM of this day. By the 321st of the 81st army division, the new commander took one look at the forward command post. Polar had occupied and ordered it moved more than a thousand yards to the rear.

Speaker 2:          01:55:56       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:55:57       The nine days on the line polars regimen had eliminated one major block house and 144 defended caves and lesser pillboxes division reported that 3,942 Japanese had been killed in the regimens zone. No enemy had been captured. Polars total casualty of men were 56% the highest regimental losses in the history of the core.

Speaker 2:          01:56:22       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:56:23       First Battalion had lost 71% the second 56% the third 55% headquarters and weapons companies, 32%

Speaker 2:          01:56:35       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:56:35       General Smith who walked the terrain after it was finally captured, said it seemed impossible that men could have moved forward against the intricate and mutually supporting defenses the Japanese had been had set up. It can only be explained as a reflection of the determination and aggressive leadership of colonel polar.

Speaker 2:          01:57:02       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:57:05       Now,

Speaker 2:          01:57:06       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:57:06       polar. That's the last major combat for polar, was it Pella? Lou, he ends up going back to the states for a bit and while he's back on the states back in the states.

Speaker 2:          01:57:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:57:21       America drops the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the war is over and shortly thereafter they order general puller.

Speaker 2:          01:57:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:57:36       Two or colonel polar at this time too. The reserves now.

Speaker 2:          01:57:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:57:45       Like I said, he, he, he, he didn't get along with some people, especially up the chain of command and he didn't want to be sent to the reserves because that's, that's not what a career marine wants to do. So here we go. Back to the book curdle you've been ordered to reserve duty in New Orleans. It's a big district, you know, and very important to the core.

Speaker 2:          01:58:08       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:58:09       Polar was not misled. He realized what it meant to be shown to reserve duty into a side pocket. Many marine career had ended that way. One of the inevitable problems with the marine corps, and this is polar talking, one of the inevitable problems with the marine corps or any other military service is that staff officers take over the minute a war ended combat. People run things when the chips are down and the country's life is at stake. But when the gun stop, nobody's got used for combat man.

Speaker 3:          01:58:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:58:43       The staff officers are like rats. They stream out of hiding and takeover. It's true. Just watch what happens to paperwork, God and peace time. They'll put out enough to sink a small size nation into the sea and when the war breaks out, most of it just naturally stops. That's the way they do everything. There must be a staff of people of course are, we'd never get everything done but if we don't stop this empire building of staff, somebody's going to come along and lick us one of these days. We'll be so nodded and red tape that we can't move.

Speaker 3:          01:59:20       Well we, you ever seen that seal team thing?

Speaker 1:          01:59:28       Um, I'll put it on a tee shirt or something but it's a Freddy the frog, the little symbol of the frog man, the Freddy the frog and he's like in a glass jar or a glass casing and it says in case of war break glass cause like you don't want the guy around when peace time is going on. Right, right, right. That's what, that's what chest, that's another chesty puller. Right. They want them during peacetime cause he's causes. He speaks up well. Piece didn't last that long. On June 25th, 1950 North Korean troops poured across the 38th parallel and strength and warhead returned. Polar recognized all the signs. He immediately asked for a modification of his orders and said urgently to headquarters. Attention is invited to the fact that I served as an officer in Haiti and Nicaragua and in the Pacific Theater for eight years prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. This experience will prove a value in an assignment to combat duty in Korea

Speaker 3:          02:00:29       and

Speaker 1:          02:00:32       well the senior personnel know that. Then he gets what he asked for. Polar arrived in southern California in the heat of late July and found San Diego and area of bedlam, marine reservists thronged in it, ev in from every corner of the nation's thousands of vehicles towards since World War Two were being overhauled and driven to port trains, bar regulars from the east coast. Unattached officers came from everywhere without a call. Volunteers for war. The First Marine Division was being created almost from scratch,

Speaker 3:          02:01:02       so they had, they had

Speaker 1:          02:01:04       dismantled so much of the service after World War II and now they've got to rebuild it all very quick. They do. They talk about it in the book. I skip over that, but we know what that consists of. Hardcore training, getting people ready for war. Finally they get, he gets to Japan and they're waiting now to go and Korea

Speaker 1:          02:01:23       into Korea. Polar hail, the passing medical corpsman and went to a nearby army hospital. I want to talk with some of the casualties. I've got to find out what's happening in Korea. He went up in an elevator with an army doctor who seemed on point on the point of tears, go into the wards and see those kids and you'll soon know more about more than you want about Korea. Take a look at all the self inflicted wounds we've got and those kids are so green, they don't even realize how obvious it is. Just from the powder burns. Polar walked down many rows of beds talking with the men. Many of them frightened and broken and heard their tales of Korea. Polar was sobered but not despair. He told some young, younger officers that night, there's nothing wrong with American kids. Their leadership has just all gone to hell. There's a whole hospital full of babies. You might say,

Speaker 2:          02:02:16       okay.

Speaker 1:          02:02:16       They were never given a chance to grow into men. It won't be that way with our marines, I'll tell you that it or preparing for d day in Incheon does the one biggest amphibious operations and they're getting ready for that and he has a little chat with his officers. We're the most fortunate of men. Most Times professional soldiers have to wait 25 years or more for a war, but here we are with only five years. Wait for this one. During that time we've sat on our fat Duff's drawing our pay. Now we're getting a chance to earn it to show the taxpayers were worth it. We're going to work at our trade for a little while. We live by the sword and if necessary, we'll be ready to die by the sword. Good luck. I'll see you a shore and listen up old man. When you have something to say to your officers are men, make it snappy. The fewer words, the better. They won't believe it. If you shoot bull when you face ranks of men and try that, you can hear him sighing, despair. When you open your mouth, if they sense you're a phony,

Speaker 2:          02:03:30       okay?

Speaker 1:          02:03:30       They can usually look at you and tell. Maybe it doesn't sound like it, but it's an important thing. You know, marines career. Don't try and don't try and what does he call it? Shoot Ball. Don't try and shoot ball. Tell the boys what's going on for real. They see right through you wrote his wife a letter before he leaves. Sweet. I will be unable to write you again for a few days, but you, Virginia, Virginia, Mac, Martha, Lee, and Louis, those are his kids.

Speaker 2:          02:04:05       Okay?

Speaker 1:          02:04:06       We'll be constantly in my thoughts.

Speaker 2:          02:04:08       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:04:08       May God bless you always and provide for you, giving you much happiness and useful lives. You my children must take advantage of all opportunities and develop into good Christians. Much love to all of you. I love you, Virginia. I always have.

Speaker 2:          02:04:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:04:28       And I always will.

Speaker 2:          02:04:34       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:04:36       Here we go into in.

Speaker 2:          02:04:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:04:39       By five 30 in the afternoon when the first waves, the marines reached the shore, the men of the fleet could no longer see in John hundreds of boats milled in the outer harbor in their turn crossing the embarkation line and moving toward land where they disappeared into a bank of smoke and dust. Polar went into his objective at blue beach with the third wave in a twilight Hasson hastened by smoke, Paul and climbed a 15 foot seawall and one of the scaling ladders improvised on a ship in route.

Speaker 2:          02:05:13       They

Speaker 1:          02:05:15       meet some fairly light resistance. Here's what polar says, it won't amount to much. Tonight. We took them by surprise. Polars casualties had been light and the divisions total for the day was only 20 killed in 170 wounded puller was awake at 3:30 AM calling the battalion commander and making plans for an attack at dawn polar swift drive. Hurry to hurry to joining forces in an effort to keep pace. Captain Ray styles of ridges battalion saw that.

Speaker 2:          02:05:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:05:46       The secret was not only in polars incisive orders, he gave us pride in some way. I can't describe all those of us had heard hundreds of stories about him and today that we couldn't actually see him doing great things. He kept building up our morale higher and higher just by being there.

Speaker 2:          02:06:04       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:06:04       When we were moving up to companies from the adjoining battalions, marched abreast and got a little mixed. One of the kid yelled, one of the kids yelled, what? What outfit are you with? Mac Fifth Marines. How about you? I got a better, I'm in polars the troops in the first thought of the old man before they fall out of their regimental number.

Speaker 2:          02:06:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:06:28       By September 17th d day plus two general MacArthur was impatient to go ashore from the command ship Mount Mckinley. He saw that his blow to Korea cut it into and had taken the enemy by surprise and the chances of ending the war. We're good.

Speaker 2:          02:06:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:06:45       He radioed Vice Admiral Arthur d Struble, the task force commander after the first good news from shore, the navy and Marines have never shown more brightly than this morning. Macarthur on one of the fiery days of the drive towards solar. Popular Chaplain, Father Keating captured five North Korean soldiers and herded them along is prisoners. He hailed a passing marine jeep driven by private wolf sawn. Take these prisoners off my hands and get them to the rear before they're hurt. I can't father. I'm running ammo into the edge of town and they're getting low. I can't stop to do it private. That's an order.

Speaker 2:          02:07:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:07:32       Take them over. Wolf looked rearward at the burning city. You mean their mind now under my responsibility. Yes. Wolf pulled up a light machine gun and sprayed the troop. Oops. Sprayed the group killing all five prisoners. The outraged Keating went to polar and demanded action. Colonel listened carefully, ordered wolf arrested and the priest went away. Content that he had done his duty 10 minutes later. Polar Aston aid. What outfit was it that lost all those boys last night? Barrows company, sir. All right, give that buy Woolful give that boy wolf a bar and send him up there.

Speaker 2:          02:08:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:08:14       Jones took the story to his cronies as an example of the military justice at its best. It spread through the outfit to become part of the polar legend.

Speaker 2:          02:08:27       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:08:31       Yeah. That seems like a pretty squared away thing to do. There's like a platoon that's getting completely destroyed and they've taken a bunch of casualties and you've got this kid that did something wrong and we can arrest him and put him in prison or whatever, or we could send them up to fight.

Speaker 2:          02:08:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:08:53       Polar sends him up to fight.

Speaker 2:          02:08:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:08:56       In the seven days since d day, there had been a 1,148 marine casualties, 145 of these killed, 20 more died of wounds and five we're missing the North Koreans. Polar said in his deep drawing voice are defending the city in such a way as to force us to destroy it. There's $1 billion worth of publicity and this, so this is when they're trying to get into soul and the North Koreans would offending soul very hard and polar basically pass to get ultra aggressive in trying to take sole.

Speaker 2:          02:09:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:09:33       Back to the book. They're fire of artillery and mortars had set the record for the Korean War. The four battalions of artillery had fired all shells at hand and had depleted in nearby army dump. At 4.2 mortars had fired 326 rounds and the big 81 650 rounds. That 50 caliber machine guns had used 120 boxes or 30,000 rounds. The night's battle would put Lieutenant Joe Fisher, Lieutenant Joe Fisher's item company to the test. Fisher dug in for the night on an isolated hill and the city's factory district overlooking the roadblock which was on his left flank from midnight to dawn. He beat off waves of attack. Fisher called for artillery. At the same time, uh, other frontline commanders asked for help, but between barrages from the North Korean swept up Fisher's hill in a bonsai charges urged by shrill force commanders in the rear.

Speaker 2:          02:10:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:10:28       Item companies, weapons including machine guns fired at top speed and bodies piled up them toward the end. When the attacks weekend, the fight turned into a Turkey shoot and fishers men slaughtered the enemy. They were glad to see the sunrise. Fisher never forgot that. Daybreak. I looked down the hill behind me and saw man hurrying up towards our position. I could see that he wasn't lugging any ammunition and thought it must be an important message, too hot for the radio.

Speaker 2:          02:10:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:10:56       Then I saw that it was colonel polars runner and he had brought us a bottle of black and white scotch. My God, where are we glad to see that it was passed down to the platoon with the most casualties and they rationed it out to those who needed it most. We knew then that the old man was thinking of us and in fact never forgot us.

Speaker 1:          02:11:20       Polar came upon marines Duggin around a barricade taking cover from fire down the street. He walked among them with the pipe stub in his mouth, get up, boys, get up and go. That's the quickest way to get it over. If you're going to get it, you can get it in holes to the line. Moved. Jo Fisher saw polar in the street. He was going along where the fire was heaviest just like he was back in Penelton as if he didn't know there was a fight within miles. I couldn't express how much good it did me and my troops to see him steady like that, just puffing that pipe. It made us feel like we could do no less than he did if there's ever been another one like him in the Marine Corps. I never saw him in my day. Bill for Ringo, the veteran who is the field sergeant major had a glimpse of the kernel. It was like going through hell passing down that sole street and who should we pass in the middle of it, but chesty it was so hot that I thought the grenades and ammunition we carried would explode. The flames almost met over our heads from the burning houses, but the colonel didn't seem in the least concerned. It gave us an extra push.

Speaker 1:          02:12:36       One of the most vague wrap up this Inchon invasion, one of the most demanding operations in marine history. It ended the division. It's sustained to 2,430 casualties. 414 of them dead of this total, 1064 had been in the last five days in the streets of Seoul and its outskirts. Murray's fifth marines had the worst of it with 1038 casualties, 177 dead polo had a total of 787 with 92 dead Litzenberg 368 72 dead.

Speaker 2:          02:13:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:13:12       Polar wrote another letter to his wife. Everything is quiet now. I'd have little to do except get my reports prepared and submitted. I wish I had a flair for writing as I as that I am certain this regiment would get the credit, do them. When the history of this operation is finally written, now knows, but in a few years what is written, we'll govern. Rest assured that I will do a better job of getting the facts in my reports that I did in the past war. I will also claim everything. Do the regimen. Many times I've regretted that my English education was cut short during the first war. Please do your best to impress upon our children the necessity of taking advantage of every opportunity in this hard old world of ours. So he recognized, you know, sad thing. It's a reality though. If you're in a leadership position in the military, you got to be able to write well and he regrets that. He wasn't a little better at it. So pay attention to the English class folks.

Speaker 3:          02:14:25       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:14:26       polar went ashore. They were back at, see Pauline went ashore in one of major Treadwell's landing craft to be met broadly by a grinning Oliver Smith. Congratulations Louie. You made it. Your board is selected you for Brigadier. Polar wagged his head by God. If it hadn't been for this war, I'd never gotten that star. There was a mild celebration ashore that night for the new general to be. So he picked up, picked up his first star has a general, and like you said, if it wasn't for the, you know, he'd been put down in some reserve unit New Orleans. He wasn't going to make general there, but case of war break glass. Now he makes general polar wrote home daily. He sent Virginia $5 check for her good school and Mark A. Good school marks, adding some parental advice. I'm very proud of my family and expect you to do well plus in everything you undertake. The difference between success and failure in this life of ours is mostly hard work. So you must constantly work to try and improve yourself. I think we can just frame that statement.

Speaker 1:          02:15:38       On November 10th the marine corps birthday, polar used a captured North Korean store to slice a hundred pound cake. He shouted to his troops after he got done delivering the, um, article from a manual, he shouted out. Now that that's complied with, I want to tell you something straight. Just do one thing for me, right? Your people back home and tell him there was one hell of a damn war going on out here and that the raggedy tailed North Koreans have been whipping a lot of so called good American troops and may do it again. Tell them there's no secret weapon for our country, but to get hard to get in there and fight, I want you to make them understand our country won't go on forever if we stay as soft as we are now, there won't be any America because some foreign soldiers soldiery will invade us and take our women and a hardier race. Yeah, there you go. He's not playing around. Isn't it interesting that we hear the same things now? Like America's getting soft? Polar was general. Polar was saying

Speaker 1:          02:16:48       after the marines had taken soul, the eighth army of the United Nations forces had driven through the Capitol moving rapidly northward along the Korean coast to meet them. Chinese Communist armories had marched 1800 miles north words since Megan mid August. The Chinese strategists at first concentrated against the eighth army position in Northwestern hills, but when the marines landed, they heard lead switched much of the power to meet the o meat and overwhelm them in the chosen reservoir. The Chinese drove between the Marines and the eighth army and maneuvered into position from which they could attack each force at will. So podcast number 53 colder than hell. It was about the chosen reservoir. And there's another one, I forget the number, but we've done two podcasts about the chosen reservoir. Listen to those.

Speaker 2:          02:17:45       Okay,

Speaker 1:          02:17:46       touch on it here as well. From the hills on every side of the perimeter, Chinese fire was heavy during the day. The enemy blew a tunnel and a bridge on the railroad below. Cota reposition cutting the line to Ha Hamhung and the Marine base on the sea for two days. Polar caller called in heavy air strikes upon concentrations of Chinese in the surrounding hills. Things were even worse than the two positions to the north of polar. At least six Chinese divisions had been identified in the area where Marie and listened. Berg fought on November 26th these two posts lost 95 dead in 543 wounded in night long attacks hag a room was preparing to fight for its life and all offensive launched by the fifth marines was called off after the day's grim news from the West. The eighth army had collapsed, one wing of it was torn to pieces and the Chinese were slashing deep into the lines. Marines must now defend themselves in an enemy free against an enemy. Free to approach from any direction through the frozen mountains.

Speaker 1:          02:18:57       The night of November 27th tested the men at Udab knee when the three Chinese division divisions fell upon two marine regiments. The end. We cut the road to hog guru and sent their assault battalions in quilted uniforms and sneakers into the marine lines with disregard for casualties. The first waves were driven off with great losses, but the others were thrown into, thrown in through the night and the next to the dismay of the Chinese commander's not even the envelopment of marine command posts slowed the temple fighting and the American stage vicious counter attacks. Even when many platoons had been reduced to the size of squads, there were not enough tent for marine wounded and the less seriously hurt were piled outside close together for warmth covered with Straw. As doctors worked over the more than 500 casualties and now became clear that the three marine positions in the chosen area, we're surrounded.

Speaker 2:          02:20:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:20:01       Polars reaction to the dread news was given to newspaper men who flew in to [inaudible]. Here's what polar said. We've been looking for the enemy for several days now. We finally found them. We're surrounded.

Speaker 2:          02:20:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:20:14       That's simplifies our problem with getting these people and killing them.

Speaker 2:          02:20:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:20:21       Yeah. Do you wonder, there's no wonder why this guy's a legend. Polar prepared to open the road to Hungary with Task Force Drysdale, a British commando unit of Royal Marines under Lieutenant Douglas Drysdale, accompanied by Captain Carl Sitters, company of Ridges Battalion, and a company from the 31st Army right army regiment which had come in the road, had been blocked in several places to bridges were out and the Chinese swarmed on heights overlooking the route. The party met bitter opposition and within a few, within a few minutes at 14 casualties in three hours and half, three hours and a half, they moved only two miles with eight more to go. Polar sent tanks as support and men came down from the hills to walk with them. They fought through roadblocks and around a blown bridge, but at dusk and narrowed defile the met an ambush and took serious casualties by radio polar. Oliver Smith and Drysdale agreed that the unit must push on to hog or through whatever the cost. The Royal Marines finally reached Hogger route perimeter at 1:30 AM with 90 of it's 255 men casualties sit or had 63 only 70 of the 210 army men made it a truck column sent behind this ill fated party was virtually destroyed after a long fight and parlay with the Chinese who captured all the trucks and most of the men,

Speaker 1:          02:21:53       the survivors of this party were crucial to the, to the defense of Haga. Rune there added firepower, help turn back another massive Chinese attack. The companies have sitter and Jo Fisher killed the enemy in droves. And by the next dawn there lines though bent handheld on the night of December 7th the bulk of the division was in polars perimeter. After the 38 hour battle from Haga row, the 103 dead, 506 wounded, seven missing, but now the force of 10,000 and it's 1000 vehicles was that [inaudible] the perimeter could hardly contain them all.

Speaker 1:          02:22:42       After supper, the colonel disappeared. Only Sergeant Jones and I haven't mentioned much about Sergeant Jones. He's like, he's, he's polars right hand man through this, through all kinds of crazy stuff. And Sergeant Jones, only Sergeant Jones knew where he was. The old man would sneak off with Bodey and go up into the lion's climbing right up into those damn straight up hills, all the ice and rock going from hole to hole for half the night. He would go to every man he could find in a foxhole and say, how you doing old man? What's your field of fire? Who's on your flank? You get enough chow on the way back, he would check. The warming tends to see if there'd been casualties and how the men were doing. Early on December eight the marines began clearing the ridges on either side of the road south, but the going was slow and the truck's bearing the bridge sections made little project progress. A funeral for 117 marines in a common grave brought the day to an end in the perimeter.

Speaker 2:          02:23:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:23:42       It was a scene that lived in polars memory, the burial of frozen bodies by a tank battalion, which crushed them under frozen ground.

Speaker 2:          02:23:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:23:50       A marine photographer took movies of the burial. Polar said how I wish our people could have seen this site to see just what happened to us and Korea.

Speaker 2:          02:24:01       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:24:01       He later heard that army censorship in Washington kept the film from the public.

Speaker 2:          02:24:11       Okay,

Speaker 1:          02:24:11       and now there again, that's very compressed story, but they're breaking out and they're heading south. Getting heading back to the sea and back to safety. Out of the, out of being surrounded back to the book, the fifth and Seventh Marines had now pass through polars ranks in the first was the rear guard for the entire division responsible for covering the withdraw down the frozen loops of the road. Polar started down and hundreds of men saw him for he thought that his job had only be gone. He shouted to every passing unit to cheer the men yelling until he was horse. Don't forget that your first marines, not all the communists and hell can overrun you.

Speaker 2:          02:24:57       Okay? Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:25:02       When he got back, reporters found him and they wanted a statement from him and he said, remember, whatever you write, this was no retreat. All that happened was we found more Chinese behind us then in front of us. So we about faced and attacked. Smith recommended polar for a navy cross for his work in the reservoir campaign. His fifth and the Marine Corps record

Speaker 1:          02:25:38       pullers letter to his wife revealed his unusual concern for his family in the midst of the campaigning. Please tell Lewis that's his son. Please tell Louis that I will finally come home and teach him how to shoot and many other things that boys and men must know. Tell him to be patient and the swords and the helmet I sent him will arrive. Tell him to change his bait in the rabbit trap every few days. A piece of Apple Lettuce, carrot, celery, turnip, and he must not go near the trap or touch it except to change the bait when the doors sprung. Also, we must keep the dog away from it to what he's telling his boy.

Speaker 2:          02:26:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:26:16       He continues on in a letter to his wife. I haven't minded the hardships here, but the killing and crippling of young men is awful due to the weather or wounded, die blood plasma freezes before it can be administered. I realized that this war is for harder on you than it has beyond me than it has been on me and I'm sorry to have caused you all the worry and pain. Then he goes on to say the Pentagon is largely responsible for this mess out here. They weren't even given. They were, they were given the money to provide us and train an army. When I entered the service, the regulation stated that the object of all military training is success in battle. This short sentence has been rewritten on three pages and I defy anyone to read over three or more times and then explain to me what the object of military training is. Even the Pentagon has not the slightest idea why they are commanding forces of the United States. In fact, out here we wonder if we are part of the United States and here he talks about his son again, tone his wife. I will not influence. My son has to choosing a profession. It will be up to him. I will not even recommend the service.

Speaker 2:          02:27:35       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:27:36       I've had to stand with my mouth closed on too many occasions and then carry out orders from too many halfwits.

Speaker 2:          02:27:46       Okay,

Speaker 1:          02:27:47       so as much as he loves the Marine Corp and the military and the country, he's saying, look, I might not even, I'm not going to even recommend that my son joins. He gets his painting of his star. Finally, he's actually being officially made a general and he makes a speech. All the credit for this star belongs to the non coms junior officers and enlisted men. You all know that. I've tried to do my duty but we'd never get anywhere except for you fellows in the ranks. This is a great regimen and it's going

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       to hurt me to leave you.

Speaker 1:          02:28:24       I'll never forget you.

Speaker 3:          02:28:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:28:26       To the man of task force polar, he also issued a formal memorandum in compliance with orders. I am today leaving this command for assignment as division commander, assistant division commander. It is not without misgivings and a certain reluctance that I carry out these orders.

Speaker 3:          02:28:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:28:43       All of you officers and men alike realize, I am sure what the First Marine regiment has meant to me.

Speaker 3:          02:28:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:28:50       I ask one more thing of you give my successor the same full measure of cooperation and willingness you have always given me and the first marines will be worthy of the name. It has already won.

Speaker 3:          02:29:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:29:03       I first commanded you on new Britain later on the bloody hills of Pell Lou and it is my and has been my honor to command you in Korea where by your deeds you captured the city of Seoul, then successfully covered the withdrawal of our division from the chosen reservoir area.

Speaker 3:          02:29:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:29:21       I shall look to future to your future movements and shall expect to hear and see still greater deeds and higher reputation. One on the field of battle. I talked a little bit about,

Speaker 3:          02:29:48       okay.

Speaker 1:          02:29:48       The dichotomy in his reputation polars reputation grew among the men, but Sergeant Jones noted that the old man was regarded as a man eater.

Speaker 3:          02:30:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:30:01       They would ask Bodie and me over and over, how the hell we kept our stripes. They thought he chewed on people all the time and when there was a fight, recklessly exposed his people.

Speaker 3:          02:30:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:30:12       And of course we knew better. It was hard to convince guys who had heard so much about him, but didn't really know him.

Speaker 3:          02:30:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:30:21       When you got close to him, you found he had a heart as big as all outdoors.

Speaker 3:          02:30:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:30:34       They continued to not make friends up the chain of command. We can't help to win. We can't hope to win future wars and we got the hell beat out of us and Korea, unless we have discipline and it's going to take some brutality to get it.

Speaker 3:          02:30:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:30:51       His last days in Korea were frustrating to Paula who found things suddenly different. He wrote his wife. Now, age has probably changed me and the core has changed too, I suppose too, man, being what he is today, I never thought this change could or would happen. Maybe I have been wrong from the beginning. No, he gets back to America and of course there's a big bunch of reporters waiting for them and they kind of know the kind of know he's got a a mouth, right. So they're, they're fired up to talk to them and he's starts talking to the reporters and here we go. What the American people want to do is fight a war without getting hurt. You can't do any good. You can't do that any more than you can go into a bar room brawl without getting hurt, unless the American people are willing to send their sons out to fight an aggressor. There's just not going to be any United States. A bunch of foreign soldiers will take over.

Speaker 2:          02:32:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:32:00       Air Power can't live up to its billing out here, somebody, not so much the aviators as the aircraft manufacturers has sold the American people a bill of goods as to what air power can do. From what I've seen, one bomb, we'll hit a section of railroad track and 100 bombs will miss some of them by miles. The enemy puts Cooley's on the track with picks and shovels and in 24 hours they're rolling again. The answer is infantry.

Speaker 2:          02:32:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:32:30       Our officer core has, has had far too much schooling and far too little combat experience. They can't warn learn war like that push button war is this far off as in the days of Julius Caesar, the rifle, hand grenade and band net are still the most important weapons. We are going to lose the next war if we don't get back to them. Why half our infantry out there is still armed with carbines against the enemy, with their fine Russian rifles.

Speaker 2:          02:33:05       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:33:05       He then turned on the training give marines which could be, which he would soon be conducting at Camp Pendleton. We've got to get them tougher to survive for all these girls out of camp. Get rid of the ice cream and candy. Get some pride in them. That's what we need most of all pride. A reporter piped up. What do you think of the protest of the women's Christian Temperance Union over sending free beer to the troops? It's news to me, Paula said, but if a few cans of beer or a snort of whiskey will make the men fight better, it might not be a bad idea. At least it's better than ice cream and all this soft training.

Speaker 2:          02:33:43       Okay,

Speaker 1:          02:33:44       there's too much damn recreation and military training. We should have only one purpose to fight and win.

Speaker 2:          02:33:52       Okay?

Speaker 1:          02:33:53       They're not being taught that now.

Speaker 1:          02:33:57       So he's an outspoken guy. He was astonished the next day to see the following headlines. Major General wants beer and whiskey for the troops. Ice Cream, Gis, lambasted, bipolar marine general blast, the air force, the fewer reached across the nation. And there was actually protests against general polar. Uh, here's, here's, they've actually put one of these letters in the book. We hereby petitions. This is sent to the, to the government or to the Pentagon. We hereby petition do you to use every ounce of influence that you possess to keep brigadier general polar from inaugurating, his beer and whiskey campaign and US military training camps. But the, uh, the panic did die down and he got to the business of training marines.

Speaker 3:          02:34:55       And

Speaker 1:          02:34:56       in August of 1953 polar took examinations for major general. That's two star. The board, which chose the new group of officers of rank approved him unanimously. In July of 1954, he was sent to Camp Lajune to lead second division. His first major piece time troop command.

Speaker 3:          02:35:19       MMM.

Speaker 1:          02:35:21       There was a little, uh, an incident health issue and one of the guys called up Virginia polar, his wife and said, brace yourself. We've taken Lewis to the hospital. They can't say what's wrong. He looks pretty sick and he basically, he gets pretty sick. He kind of recovers from it. But the, like I said, this guy made enemies. So here we go back to the book and this is polar talking. I could see then what the game was. They were going to retire me despite all the, all the doctors had said back at lunch at noon, they'd pulled me up to Washington to get rid of me. I didn't mind retiring all that much, but the way they did it made me sore. I had all the service and honors I needed or wanted, I'd come all the way from private to major general, but I was boiling mad about this thing. I saw lots of officers around Washington in poor condition than I was, but that wasn't going to matter. He remained in the hospital and the Festa for about two weeks after many consultations, the doctors found him unfit for duty. He wrote his wife daily from his room on the 16th floor, please do not worry. We must take things as they come in life. There doesn't seem much we can do to change events.

Speaker 1:          02:36:43       So yeah, just to tell that story a little more. He had like a, some kind of health as it was, I don't know what it was and they didn't really seem to know what it was, but then he kind of recovered from it and he back in his job and then they pulled them up to Bethesda and to give them a bunch of screenings and tests and see if he was fit for duty and they found that he was unfit for duty. So that's it. That's how it ended. That's how his career ended. A day or so before he went out. There was a party in the noncommissioned officers' club on polar had declined an offer from the officer's club, but he could not turn the enlisted men. It began as an intimate party, but when polar arrived, he found a crowd of more than 5,000 who'd come to say goodbye. 20 pigs were barbecued and there was feasting and drinking until late in the night. The general made one of his shirt burst talks when they shouted for him and Sergeant Orval Jones remembered it. He said, only men, I'd rather be toting a rifle and a rear rank than going out now as lieutenant general. Now if you're a marine, you're all marine. You'll put the core above your family, your country, even God and all else. In some cases you stick to your core.

Speaker 1:          02:38:01       God bless you. Polar had broken tradition to the last. It was unwritten regulation that the senior marine officer on the post would pin polars third star on his shoulder as he retired, but polar had called for Bob Norris, the senior noncommissioned officer and the oldest man available who had served with him. The reporter who followed him got a formal statement and having sergeant major norish attach my third star at my retirement. I wanted to show my great admiration and appreciation to the enlisted men and junior officers of the Marine Corps. I fully realize that without the help of the enlisted men, I'd never have risen from private to lieutenant general. I've commanded to everything from a squad to a division and without the help of men and junior officers, these units would never have gone forward and achieve their objective regardless of almost certain death. My only regret is that things now are, I will not be present for the next or I also want to express my regret at the deaths of many hundreds of marines and the crippling and maiming of other hundreds who followed me blindly into battle. Again, I would like to thank all marines for their feelings toward me.

Speaker 1:          02:39:26       Louis polar went home to Virginia. It was just 37 years, four months and two days since he had boarded the train in South Carolina for South Carolina to exchange the uniform of a Vmi Cadet for that of a Marine Corps boot. But his career with the Marines wasn't quite over. Back to the book. On a dimly lit night of April 8th, 1956 a platoon of marine recruits at Parris Island, South Carolina, was marched into a title arm of broad river by 31 year old veteran drill instructor, Staff Sergeant Matthew c McCune. Six recruits drowned. The commandant, General Randolph Mccall Pate immediately relieved the commanding officer of the recruit depot and told Congress that McCune would be punished to the full extent allowed by our uniform code of military justice. There was a nationwide outcry from the press pulpit and scores of civic organizations. A court inquired choir. He descended upon Parris Island. Mccune became a national cause to celebrate a sailed by prohibit prohibitionists as a brutal drunkard, as a symbol of military tyranny, which must be destroyed as a racist bigot. Near Do. Well, there were cries for harsh punishment, even execution.

Speaker 2:          02:40:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:40:57       Now he ends up going to trial and for this trial, the defense brings in chesty puller per we know, believes in hard training. And here we go. This is a court scene. Berman, who's the lawyer use the general like a master showman that offense desires to call to the stand. A lieutenant general polar.

Speaker 2:          02:41:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:41:24       Seven years. One of the lawyers, sir. How do you know the accused polar? I don't know him except by his pictures in the newspapers and what I've read about him than Berman took over in question. The general about his career as a Marine Berman. How long were you in Korea? Polar? About nine months. Berman, were you in combat? Yeah. Where you decorated? Yeah. Without going into any other, any of your other decorations, isn't it true that you've received five Navy crosses? Correct.

Speaker 2:          02:41:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:41:55       Berman asked his opinion of the Marine Corps' mission. The definition of military training is success in battle.

Speaker 2:          02:42:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:42:04       In my opinion, that is the only objective of military training. It wouldn't make any sense to have a military organization on the backs of the American taxpayers with any other definition. I believe that ever since I was been a marine.

Speaker 2:          02:42:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:42:18       What is the most important element of that training? I'll quote Napoleon. He stated that the most important thing in military training is disciplined without discipline and army becomes a mob.

Speaker 2:          02:42:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:42:31       Now then in that context, can you tell us whether you have an opinion based on your experience as to whether or not the training and discipline is for all situations confined to lesson plan or syllabi or training regulations? No. The training of a basic marine is conducted almost entirely outside in the field on the drill ground, on the rifle range, that kind of work. The marine gets an idea of how the Marine Corps run during this training, but it's training is outside work.

Speaker 2:          02:43:02       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:43:02       Can you tell us general of the things you learned here as a recruit? Well, the main thing that I've remembered all my life is the definition of a spree decor. Now, my definition, the definition I was taught that have always believed in is that a spree decor means love for one's military legion. In my case, the United States Marine Corps. I also learned that this loyalty to one's corps travels both ways up and down, and he continued through this trial and that night he went to the enlisted man's club and big crowd of course was there and they start shouting and yelling for him to speak and finally he stands up and says, I've talked enough for today. This will be my last request. Do your duty. And the Marine Corps will be as great as it has always been for another thousand years.

Speaker 2:          02:44:04       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:44:04       the applause was deafening.

Speaker 2:          02:44:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:44:11       Went back to his hometown of Saluda and he was not forgotten there. There he was getting interviewed by a graduate student who is trying to learn about psychology and the general said, I've never studied psychology. I had only one year of college and always thought I would go back, but enlisted instead. I think the Marine Corps is the best place to learn the art of war

Speaker 1:          02:44:40       and then again, this reflects back, you know, people now say that America is getting soft and the youth are so they're saying the same thing. Everything's going bad and that they have a panel of experts to deal with the decline of the nation and it's a rising tide of juvenile delinquency. The consensus, the consensus was that the country was going to hell in a hand bucket. General polar while this big meeting is going on, general polar stood and intended in his intended mildness of tone as usual came forth as a brazen war. I want you people to know something. As long as we can get some decent leadership in our country, our youth of today will be better men than their fathers or grandfathers. I saw enough in Korea to make sure that our forefathers at valley forge have been mentioned here tonight as they often are.

Speaker 1:          02:45:33       Well, I can tell you that valley forge was something like a picnic compared to what your younger Americans went through at the chosen reservoir and they came out of it fine. It was never anything like 25 below zero at valley forge either. I admit, we don't seem to have the proper leadership at the top, but there's nothing wrong with the kids today. My wife and I follow the ideas my mother used on her kids, making them study each night after this, after supper, and when they report that they have mastered their lessons, quizzing them, our children don't need to be coddled and shouldn't be condemned. Above all, for Heaven Sakes, let your son's alone and let them grow up to be men. It's interesting that I would say that still applies in very many ways.

Speaker 1:          02:46:30       He also had people visiting him all the time and asking him questions and he was, again, he remained speak, you know, uh, uh, an outspoken guy. I'm afraid we haven't recognized the most important lesson from Korea. The communists have developed a totally new kind of warfare, uh, warfare of whole peoples. And under that no modern nation can be conquered. We saw something like that in China when Japan was nibbling away at the mainland. The Japanese controlled only a square yard where a soldier stood and nothing beyond that. In Korea, the reds improved on that. This is total warfare, yet small in scope and it's designed to neutralize our big nuclear weapons. Look at Vietnam. The French outnumbered the communist two to one. Yet they were massacred. If we don't design some way to meet this, they'll whip us in the end. Don't forget that regular armies of never fared well in red, irregular warfare and that lesson was old when Rome fell. It's amazing that he's saying this. It's just, it's just a mandate. We do. You know the French had been beat. We hadn't eat, I don't think we're even in Vietnam yet. In fact, we weren't Vietnam yet when this, when he's making these statements,

Speaker 1:          02:47:43       we didn't pay attention to it.

Speaker 1:          02:47:49       Finally, he goes to a, and there was some kind of a rift between him and the First Marine Division Association and they sorted out that rift and he went to a big reunion of the Marine Corps, the First Marine Division Association, back to the Book General Smith blinked against the spotlight and turn to the blackness. At the far end of the table. I now give you chesty and they'll rare. The roar was so loud, it drowned out the speaker's voice and shook the walls. The spotlight swung to the last place at the table to reveal polar in a linen suit, waving his hand and flashing his broad crooked grin. As the clamor increased, he marched to the microphone and started a in a bobbing circle of light. General Smith shouted to the tempest of the sound. I see. You all know chesty puller. Men in the crowd danced among the tables world each other about and pounded their neighbors on the backs. Some climbed on their chairs shouting wordlessly tears streaming on their tricks. Others hammered the table with cutlery or embraced women who were staring incredulously at polar.

Speaker 3:          02:49:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:49:02       The men broke into chance. We want chesty. We want polar. They called for a speech, but it was almost five minutes before the howling ceased. Polar face them with a wry smile that looked as if it had been rung from his face by force. When quiet returned, he grasped the microphone and called an an astonishing leap. Penetrating voice. Marines. Pandemonium broke out once more as if he had shouted some secret watch word whose implications were known only to these men. Half the crowd was still on its feet a moment later when polar could be heard again.

Speaker 2:          02:49:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:49:45       If you believe the newspapers and radios and television, our country is in a hell of a shape.

Speaker 2:          02:49:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:49:52       I don't believe it. So long as we've got the first marine division, we'll be okay. The crowd shouted him into silence again. He was tired when he got home to Saluda and that evening, Virginia polar found him pensive and distractive, distracted. They sat on the screened porch looking out into the Virginia dusk lit by fireflies. Louis, is there anything you'd wish for now that it's all over? Well, he said I'd like to do it all over again. The whole thing. She side more than that, more than anything. I'd like to see the face once again of every marine I've ever served with,

Speaker 2:          02:51:09       and that

Speaker 1:          02:51:13       is where this book ends. But that is not where this story ends because as I mentioned then as the book mentioned, Chesty Puller had a son.

Speaker 2:          02:51:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:51:33       And his son also became a Marine Corp officer, but his son's experience in the Marine Corps in combat and in life was very different from his father's good. I will tell that story in the next episode, number 122 which is available now so you can listen to it immediately

Speaker 2:          02:52:05       because these

The new podcast is called the war. Your kid podcast, ask Uncle Jake. Like I said, it's a separate channel, so you have to subscribe to it separately. I did that because as you know from listening to this podcast, there's some podcasts that are for very mature audiences and you wouldn't want to have your kid listening to that, you know, a kid podcast. Then all of a sudden a very violent podcast comes on. So we separated them, the warrior kid podcast questions for Uncle Jake and

Speaker 2:          02:57:31       yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:57:32       I think uncle Jake has lessons for everyone regardless of age. Yeah. You know, I think teachers and parents and big time would want to listen to that as well. Yeah, we've got some great feedback so far on it. So that's called the warrior kid podcast. And on top of that, there's a new war. Your kid book, it's called Mark's mission. If you actually want it, you should order it now through whatever channel you want to order it from. Go to your local bookstore, go to Amazon, go to and noble, order it so that you have it when it comes out so that the publisher knows how many to make because otherwise the publisher thinks, oh well we'll, we won't make that many of them because there's not that many people that you know are going to buy this. They're wrong because you all are going to buy this. So if they don't know that they don't make enough, it takes too long to get it once it comes out. So order it now. Other books you can order. Extreme ownership, combat leadership for business and life discipline equals freedom field manual. It's about getting after it and actually Leif Babin and I have a new book coming out, a follow up to treme ownership. It's called the dichotomy of leadership. It is available for preorder right now. Same thing. Order it now so that you get your copy when it comes out. Otherwise you'll be waiting.
