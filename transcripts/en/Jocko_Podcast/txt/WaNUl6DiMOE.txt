Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 103 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening whilst lying at Winchester young as I was in the profession, I was picked out amongst others to perform a piece of duty that for many years afterwards remain deeply impressed upon my mind and gave me the first impression of the stern duties of a soldier's life.

Speaker 2:          00:00:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:30       A private of the 70th regiment had deserted from that core and afterwards enlisted into several other regiments. Indeed, I was told at the time that 16 different times he had received the bounty and then stolen off being however caught at last, he was brought to trial at Smith and sentenced by General Court Martial to be shot.

Speaker 2:          00:00:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       As the execution would be a good hint to us, a young ins. There were four lads picked out of our core to assist in this piece of duty. Myself being one of the number chosen besides these men for soldiers from three other regiments were ordered on the firing party making 16 at all. The place of execution was ports down hill and the different regiments assembled must have composed a force of about 15,000 men having been assembled from the isle of Wight, from Chester, Chester, golf, sport and other places.

Speaker 2:          00:01:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       The site was very imposing and appeared to make a deep impression on all their, as for myself, I felt that I would have given a good round some had. I possessed it to have been in any other situation rather than one rather than the one which I now found myself. And when I looked into the faces of my companions, I saw by the pallor and anxiety, anxiety depicted in each countenance, the reflection of my own feelings.

Speaker 2:          00:02:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:17       When all was ready, we were moved to the front and the culprit was brought out.

Speaker 2:          00:02:23       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:23       He made a short speech to the parade acknowledging the justice of his sentence and that drinking and evil company had brought the punishment upon him. He behaved himself firmly and well and did not seem to flinch at all. After being blindfolded. He does. He was desired to kneel down behind a coffin, which was placed on the ground. And the drum major of the depot giving us an expressive glance. We immediately commenced to loading. This was done in the deepest silence and the next moment we were primed and ready. There was then a dreadful pause for a few moments and the drum major again looking towards us, gave us the signal, agreed upon before a flourish of his cane and we leveled

Speaker 2:          00:03:24       and fired.

Speaker 1:          00:03:27       We had been previously strictly enjoined to be steady and take good aim and the poor fellow pierced by several balls fell heavily upon his back as he lay with his arms pinion to his sides. I observed that his hands waived for a few moments like the fins on a fish. When in the agonies of death, the drum major also observed the movement and making another signal. Four of our Party immediately stepped up to the posture a body and placing the muscles of their pieces to the head fired and put him out of his misery.

Speaker 2:          00:04:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:10       The different regiments then fell back by companies and the word being given to march past in slow time when each company came in line with the body, the word was given to mark time and then eyes left in order that we all might observe. The terrible example. We then moved on words and marched from the ground to our different quarters,

Speaker 2:          00:04:42       and that

Speaker 1:          00:04:44       is from a book called recollections of Riflemen Harris, who was an enlisted soldier for the British army during the Napoleonic wars, and that was his welcome to the army. He'd been in for about three weeks of service when he had to

Speaker 2:          00:05:04       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:05:04       stand and execute a fellow soldier

Speaker 2:          00:05:09       four

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       basically being drunk and disorderly, not doing what he was supposed to do. Brett, essentially, he was being executed for being a human being. And that was the introduction to military service for riflemen Harris Riflemen Harris, his full name was Benjamin Randall Harris. He enlisted in 1803 he fought all over Europe in the peninsular war, which posed bourbon, Spain, the Kingdom of Portugal, and the British empire against Napoleon's French empire and boat apart just Spain. And also the Duchy of Warsaw, and this is a war

Speaker 3:          00:05:59       where they have daggers and swords and Bay and nets and mounted cavalry charges. They have cannons and they used a lot of muzzle loading rifles, which a skilled rifleman could load and fire about three times per minute. Hmm. Accurate out to about 200 yards. Very different from the weapons that we have now, which can fire three rounds in a second and are very accurate out to 800 yards, a thousand yards and some sniper weapons way further than that, but even though these weapons are different from the weapons we see in modern warfare.

Speaker 2:          00:06:50       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:06:51       As always, in the end it is men.

Speaker 2:          00:06:57       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:06:57       It is. Human beings on the battlefield, bleeding, sweating, starving, suffering, killing and being killed.

Speaker 3:          00:07:13       Let's find out a little bit more about rifleman. Harris. Going back to the book, my father was a shepherd and I was a sheep boy from my earliest youth. Indeed. As soon as almost I could run, I began helping my father to look after the sheep on the downs of Branford endorsed it. Sure. Where I was born. Whilst I continued to tend the flocks and herds under my charge and occasionally in the long winter nights I learned the art of making shoes. I grew a hardy little chap and was one fine day in the year of 1802 drawn as a soldier for the army of reserve. Thus, without troubling myself much about the change which was about to take place in the quiet of my routine days, I was drafted into the 66 the regiment of foot bid good bye to my shepherd companions and was obliged to leave my father without an assistant to collect his flocks just as he was beginning more than ever to require one nay.

Speaker 3:          00:08:22       Indeed, I may say, to want tending and looking after himself for old age and infirmary. We're coming on him. His hair was growing white as the sleep of our downs and his countenance becoming as furrowed as the plowed fields around. However, has I had no choice in the matter. It was quite as well that I did not grieve over my fate. My father tried hard to buy me off and would have persuaded the sergeant of the 66 that I was of no use as a soldier from having maimed my right hand by breaking the fourth finger when I was a child. The sergeant however said I was just the sort of little chat he wanted and off he went carrying me amongst a batch of recruits. He'd collected a way with him.

Speaker 2:          00:09:14       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:09:15       Sheepherder Dad's getting old army comes and gets you. That's the way it works. England 1802

Speaker 3:          00:09:31       now he travels around a little bit and eventually ends up in Dublin and here we go back to the bulk Walston Dublin I one day saw core of the 95th rifles and fell so in love with their smart dashing and devil may care appearance that nothing would serve me until I was a rifleman myself. So on. Arriving at Castle one day and falling in with the recruiting party of that regimen, I volunteered into the second battalion, this recruiting party, we're all Irishman and I had and had been sent over from England to collect amongst others, men from the Irish militia and we're just about to return to England. I think they were as reckless and devil may care. A set of men I had ever been beheld either before or since. So these, these riflemen I would say from what I read about them, they're, they're almost like a special ops unit.

Speaker 3:          00:10:29       And one big difference is they're wearing, instead of wearing red jackets like the, the Brits would wear it this time they wore green. So they were a little bit different and they had more accurate rifles and they would fight, they would do what they called skirmishing, which is, is fundamentally cover move. They'd shoot and they'd maneuver and they'd, they'd, they'd act like little special operations troops out there. And of course it's interesting to me and when I hear this guy talking about the first time he saw someone that looked a little bit like a special operations troops, he said it. He actually says, I fell in love with it. You know, that's, that's very much how I felt as I was growing up. The more I saw, you know, the special ops, he's, he actually didn't even need to be special ops. For me. It was just someone in the military, but then he was already in the military.

Speaker 3:          00:11:23       So now he's looking for the next thing. What's the next thing going to be? And here he ends up as, as a rifleman. So he's now a right from an, he joins, he moves over to their regimen and here we go back to the book. The next day we marched for Ashford and Kent where I joined the 95th rifles and about six months after my joining for companies of the second battalion were ordered on the expedition to Denmark. We embarked it deal and sailing for hostile shores landed on a little place called I think scarlet island. The expedition consisted of about 30,000 men and at the moment of our getting on shore, the whole force set up one simultaneous and tremendous cheer. A sound I cannot describe. It seemed so inspiring. This indeed was the first time of my hearing, the style in which our men give tongue when they get near the enemy. Though afterwards, my years became pretty well accustomed to such sounds.

Speaker 3:          00:12:25       As soon as we got on shore, the rifles were pushed, pushed forward, and he says the rifles, he's talking about his guys, the rifles were pushed forward as the advance in chain order through some thick woods of for and when we had cleared these woods and approached Copenhagen, centuries were posted on the roads and openings leading toward the town in order to intercept all comers and prevent all supplies. Such posts were occupied for about three days and nights whilst the town was being fired upon by our shipping. I rather think this was the first time of the con grieve rockets being brought into play and they rushed through the air and the dark. They appeared. So like so many fiery serpents creating, I should think, terrible dismay among the besieged, the con grieve rockets. They basically look like giant bottle rockets in a way. [inaudible] they got at this time they were getting their range out to 1500 2000 meters.

Speaker 3:          00:13:22       So it was a pretty crazy weapon and, and I can tell you rockets in this day and age have become fairly accurate, but in those days they'd probably about as accurate as a bottle rocket is. My guests back to the book, as the main army came up, we advanced and got as near under the walls of the place as we could without being endangered by the fire from our own shipping. So what's happening right there was covered move. The shipping is bombarding and these guys are advancing as close as they can where they are not going to get killed by their own, by their own fire from the ships. We now received orders ourselves to commence firing and the rattling of the guns, I shall not easily forget. I felt so much exhilarated that I could hardly keep back and was checked by the commander of the company who called me by my name to keep my place about this time, my front rank man, a tall fellow named Jack Johnson, showed a disposition as though the firing had an effect on him. The reverse of what it had had on many others of the company for he seemed inclined to hang back and once or twice turned round in my face, I was a rear rank man and porting my piece and the excitement of the moment I score that if he did not keep his ground, I would shoot him dead on the spot

Speaker 3:          00:14:42       so that he found it, he would go on so that he found it would be quite as dangerous for him to return as to go on. I feel sorry to record the want of courage of this man, but I do so with the less pain it gives me the opportunity of saying that during my many years of arduous service is the only instance I remember of a British soldier endeavoring to hold back when his comrades were moving forward. Indeed Johnson was never held again. An estimation among the rifle core for the story got wind that I had threatened to shoot him for cowardice in the field and Lieutenant Cox mentioned to the kernel that he'd overheard my doing so and such was the contempt the man was held in by the rifles that he was soon afterwards removed.

Speaker 3:          00:15:34       There you go. The first time under fire, it's, it's interesting how rifleman Harris first time under fire, he wants to get after it. He is ready to charge and only one guy out of their whole crew is looking like he's going to hold back and they talk about reputation here and that's definitely something that is when you get to the seal teams, as you're a new guy, someone tells you, they'll say, hey, your reputation is everything. And it's totally true. And it's the same in any military organization, what your reputation is because, because in the military, you think ranks all important, right? Yeah. But, but the reality is there's something that completely Trump's rank and that's reputation. And if you're, I mean, I always talk about the fact that relationships are more important than chain of command, but you're not going to have a good relationship with people if you don't have a good reputation. It's not happening. Yeah. So it makes sense. The same thing back in 1803,

Speaker 2:          00:16:33       yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:16:35       Back to the book. Whilst in Denmark we led a tolerably active life. The rifles being continually on the alert ordered hither today and countermanded the next occasionally. Also we had some pleasant adventures among the Blue Wide Danish lasses for the rifles were always terrible fellows in that way.

Speaker 2:          00:17:01       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:17:03       That doesn't need too much explanation. They, I'll say this as I always say, I have to fast forward through this book. I'm not reading the entire book, even though the entire book is awesome in this point. This point here, they're embarking for pers, uh, Portugal. We have another,

Speaker 3:          00:17:25       another campaign to go on back to the book. I wish I could picture the splendid site of the shipping and the downs. At the time we embarked with about 20,000 men. Those were times which are sold, which the soldiers of our own more peaceable days have little conception of. So this book was written before World War One and, and really this was the, the last big war is the boards that he went through the Napoleonic wars. So he's kind of, he's kind of saying, you don't even know what this is like anymore. You don't know what it is. Like you don't know what the, the, the, the soldiers of our own more peaceable days have little conception of what it's like to embark 20,000 troops to get ready and go get some,

Speaker 2:          00:18:07       hmm.

Speaker 3:          00:18:09       Back to the book. We sailed majestically out of the cove of Cork for hostile sure. Where we were safely arrived and disembarked at Monday go bay. The rifles were first out of the vessels for we were indeed always in front of the advance and always in the rear in retreat like the Kentish men of old, we claimed the post of honor in the field. I tried to figure out what that Kentish man can't is obviously a place and and the as far the best I could figure out was that the people in Kent stood up hardcore against the Norman invasion. I think that's what that reference is too. I'm sure somebody will correct me and I hope somebody does. Back to the bulk of being immediately pushed forward up the country and advanced the main body. Many of us in this hot climate very soon began to find out the misery of the frightful load.

Speaker 3:          00:19:04       We were condemned to march and fight under with a burning sun above our heads and our feet sinking every step into the hot sand. The weight of the weight I myself toiled under was tremendous and I often wonder at the strength I possessed at this period that which enabled me to endure it for indeed. I'm convinced that many of our infantry sank and died under the weight of their knapsacks alone. For my own part being a handicraft handicraft, I marched under the weight sufficient to impede the free motions of a donkey for besides my well filled kit, there was the great coat rolled on its top, my blanket and camp cattle, my haversack stuffed full of leather for repairing the men's shoes together with a hammer and other tools, ship biscuit and beef for three days. I also carried my canteen filled with water, my hatchet and rifle and 80 rounds of ball cartridge in my pouch. This last, except the beef and biscuit being the best thing I owned and which I always gave the enemy the benefit of when the opportunity offered.

Speaker 3:          00:20:15       It's interesting, he knew how to work on shoes and so he carries stuff to repair shoes in the field. Mm Eight think about that. That's just a lost art, isn't it? But think about where you are in the field when you have to March 15 miles a day and you have no shoes. If there's someone that can fix your shoes, that's, that's a godsend. Yeah. Back to the book the next day. We again advanced and being in a state of the utmost anxiety to come up along the French, neither the heat of the burning sun, long miles or heavy, we're able to diminish our Arbor. Indeed. I often look back with wonder at the light hearted style, the agility and the reckless indifference with which men who were so destined in short time to fall, hurry, dawn words toward the field of strife seemingly without a thought of anything but the sheer love of meeting the Foa and the excitement of battle.

Speaker 3:          00:21:14       He wrote this book 20 something years after this happened. After this experience. I want to say he wrote it in 1930 something 1938 maybe is when it came out and you can see that the so, so my point in saying that is that looking back he knows because he's, he's, he's going, he's going to go through hell. He's going to go through hardcore combat. But even even knowing how horrible combat is, he still looks back in, is, is amazed at how they were ready to go. Going back to the book. The 29th regiment received so terrible a fire that I saw, the right wing almost annihilated and the colonel, I think his name was Lennox lay sprawling amongst the rest. We had caught ourselves in it pretty handsomely for there was no cover for us and we were rather to near the living skirmishers. We're laying beside heaps of their own dead, but still we had her own till the battalion regiments come up.

Speaker 3:          00:22:24       Fire and retire is a very good sound, but the rifles were not over fond of such notes. We never performed that maneuver except when it was made pretty plain to us that it was quite necessary. The 29th however, had got their fairing hair at this time and the shock of that fire seemed to stagger the whole line and make them recoil. At the moment a little confusion appeared in the ranks. I thought Lord Hill was near at hand and saw it and I observed him come galloping up. He put himself at the head of the regimen and restored them to order. In a moment. There's some leadership just full on leadership and action. So there's also fire and retire. What that means is covered move. So you have some people shooting and some people falling back. That's how they retreat and there they use that whenever they have to retreat, you'll hear that and in, I dunno if I did this, made this clear enough, but it's a bugle. It's a bugle signal. So the bugle would play some certain number of notes or some pattern of notes and p and everyone would know, okay, that means firing, retire. So now we're now we get that broad, that broad.

Speaker 2:          00:23:31       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:23:33       the broad plan out to everyone at once, which is instead of advancing, which is what we were doing, now we're going to, we're going to retreat and as soon as you get everyone that information, now little elements can start to make it happen. That's decentralized, but you have to give good communications in order for that to work. And what you need to communicate is the broad plan and that's what they get done with a nice little bugle signal back to the book pouring or regular and sharp fire upon the enemy. He galled them in return and remaining with the 29th until he brought them to the charge. Quickly sent the foe in the right about, it seemed to me that few men could have conducted the business with more coolness and quietude of manner under such as storm of balls as he was exposed to.

Speaker 3:          00:24:19       Indeed. I have never forgotten him from that day. So yeah, it's important to also recognize that you have a, you have a group of men that are about to fall apart and there's confusion. And one guy, I talk about this all the time, one guy steps up, takes ownership of the situation leads, and it changes the entire outcome of the battle. Think about that one person. You got thousand men versus a thousand men. One person makes the difference. So if you're in a leadership position, think about that. Thinking about what you're doing, are you leading? Are you stepping up? Are you galloping up on a horse and setting things right? Do you need to be doing back to the book? At the time I was remarking these matters, loading and firing as I lay another circumstance, divided my attention for a while and made me forget even the gallant conduct of General Hill, a man near me uttered a scream of agony and looking from the 29th who were on my right to the left once the screen should come, I saw one of our sergeants named Frazier sitting in a doubled up position and swing backwards and forwards as though he had got a terrible pain in his bowels.

Speaker 3:          00:25:30       He continued to make such complaint that I arose and went to him for. He was rather a crony of mine. Oh Harris said he, as I took him in my arms, I shall die. I shall die. The agony is so great that I cannot bear it,

Speaker 2:          00:25:46       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:25:46       It was indeed dreadful to look upon him. The froth came from his mouth and the perspiration poured from his face. Thank heaven. He was soon out of pain can laying him down. I returned to my place. Poor fellow. He suffered more for a short time that he was dying than any man. I think I ever saw him in the same circumstances. I had the courtesy to return and look at him after the battle. The Musket ball I found had taken him sideways and gone through both groins.

Speaker 2:          00:26:23       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:26:24       Within about a half an hour after this, I left sergeant Frazier and indeed for the time how'd as completely forgotten him as if he had died a hundred years back. The site of so much bloodshed around will not suffer the mind to dwell long in any particular casualty. Even though it happened to one's dearest friends. There was no time either to think for all was action with us. Rifles just at this moment and the barrel of my peace was so hot from continual firing that I could hardly bear to touch it and was obliged to grasp the stock beneath the iron as I continued to blaze away.

Speaker 2:          00:27:11       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:27:12       Doesn't even have time to think about it. Yeah. James Ponton was another crony of mine, a gallon fellow. He had pushed himself in front of me and was checked by one of our officers, rap for his rashness. Keep back, you Ponton. The lieutenant said to him more than once, but Pontin was to be restrained by Ponton was not to be restrained by anything, but a bullet went in action this time. He got one which striking him in the thigh, I suppose, hit an artery for, he died quickly. The French man's balls were flying very wickedly at that moment and I crept up to Ponton and took shelter by lying behind and making a rest from my rifle of his dead body.

Speaker 2:          00:28:00       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:28:00       It strikes me that I revenged his death by the assistance of his carcass.

Speaker 2:          00:28:06       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:28:06       At any rate, I tried my best to hit his enemies hard. There were two small buildings to our front and the French having managed to get into them, annoyed as much from that quarter. A small rise in the ground closed before these houses also favored them and our men were being handled very severely. In consequence, they became angry and wouldn't stand it any longer. One of the skirmishers jumping off, rushed forward crying over boys over, over. When he instantly, when instantly the whole line responded to the cry over, over, over. They ran along the grass like wildfire, then dash at the rise fixing their sword bayonets as they ran the French light. Bob's could not stand the sight but turned about and fled and getting possession of their ground. We were soon inside the buildings. After the battle was over, I stepped across the other house.

Speaker 3:          00:29:04       I have mentioned in order to see what was going on there for the one I remained in was now pretty well filled with the wounded, both French and English, who had managed to get there for a little shelter. Two or three surgeons also had arrived at this house and we're busily engaged in giving their assistance to the wounded. Now also here, lying is thickly as in the building, which I had left, but what struck me the most, but what struck me the most forcibly was that from the circumstance of some wine bots having been left in the apartment and having their engagement been perforated, having in the engagement been perforated by bullets and otherwise broken, the red wine had escaped most plentiful and ran down upon the earth and floor where the wounded were lying so that many of them were soaked in the wine with which their blood was mingled.

Speaker 2:          00:30:00       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:30:01       Aye. Aye. Aye. I hate to even think about the medical care that these guys are getting. Yeah. In any the Ma, the medical care that that we had in Iraq was unbelievable. Not only from the speed that you would get assistance, but also the quality of care that you would get on in the field from our own medics and how quickly they would get you to get to you and then get you taken care of, I think get you evacuated to a full medical facility. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:30:35       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:30:36       And that, that actually changed during my time in the teams. For instance, the biggest, the biggest change it when, when I first gotten the teams, it, the, what we were taught was if someone gets shot, you immediately give them an ivy, meaning you know, a bag of fluid because they're bleeding. You got to replace that. And now the, they don't do that automatically because your body has its own mechanisms. When it loses blood to stop the bleeding, it pulls back in the, the arteries and veins and it constricts them and clots the blood that's there. And so, and when you give someone an ivy, the body thinks I don't need to do that. So it opens up the arteries, it opens up the veins, it doesn't constrict anything. It doesn't get clots slower. So there's like one example and that that's during my time. So that's the last 25 years that that change has taken place. So now you go back, you know, 102 hundred years, it's totally different. Totally different. And they'll talk more about that. And the, the basic, the basic plan was if you get shot in the limb, you're losing the limb. Yeah. That. That's basically what's going on. Just amputations

Speaker 3:          00:31:50       Kinda and nowadays they do an incredible job of saving, saving limbs if they can be saved, they saved them. I mean they do an incredible job.

Speaker 3:          00:32:02       All right, back to the book, it was on the 15th of August when we first came up with the French and their skirmishers immediately commenced operations by raiding a shower of balls upon us as we advanced, which we returned without delay, and I haven't said this yet, but the reason they're saying balls instead of round is because these guys are shooting the balls, the round balls of led and at this point there was some rifling had started to come about, but what they basically just consider everything to be a ball, a lead and that's why they're not accurate. That's why they're only accurate out to 200 meters because they're not rifled like we have the tight rifling spinning bullets today. Back to the book, the first man that was hit was Lieutenant Bunbury. He fell pierce through the head with a musket ball and died almost immediately.

Speaker 2:          00:32:54       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:32:54       I fought. I never heard such a tremendous noise as the firing made on this occasion and the men on both sides of me. I could occasionally observe. We're falling fast. I do not pretend to give a description of this or any other battle I have been present at. All I can do is tell the things which happened immediately around me and that I think is as much as a private soldier can be expected to do.

Speaker 2:          00:33:21       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:33:21       Soon afterwards, the firing commenced and we had taken, we had advanced pretty close upon the enemy taking advantage of whatever cover I could find. I threw myself behind a small bank where I lay so secure that although the Frenchmans bullets fell pretty thickly around, I was enabled to knock several over without being dislodged. In fact, I fired away every round I had in my pouch waltzed laying in this spot at length after a sharp contest. We forced them to give ground and following them up, drove them from their position in the heights and hung up their skirts until they made another stand and then the game began again.

Speaker 2:          00:34:04       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:34:04       The rifles indeed fought well this day and we lost many men. They seemed in high spirits and delighted at having driven the enemy before them. Joseph coach and was by my side loading and firing very industriously about this period of the day. First thing with heat and action, he lifted his canteen to his mouth. Here's to you, old boy, he said is he took a pullet its contents.

Speaker 2:          00:34:32       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:34:32       As he did so a bullet went through the canteen and perforated his brain, killing him in a moment,

Speaker 2:          00:34:39       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:34:39       Another man fell close to him, almost immediately struck, struck by a ball in the thigh,

Speaker 2:          00:34:47       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:34:47       I saw a man named Simmons struck full in the face by around shot and he came to the ground, a headless trunk.

Speaker 2:          00:34:59       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:35:00       When the role was called after the battle, the females who missed their husbands came along the front of the line to inquire of the survivors, whether they knew anything about them so the wives could travel with the soldiers. And again, that just seems crazy to me right now. But that's, that's the way they did it and not all of them. But if, if they made that decision, I guess as a family to stick together, they'd get right on board the boats and they'd, they'd March, they marched, they cover it in this book, they'll get there, they wouldn't carry the weight, but they'd marched alongside and go from place to place and when the battle is about to take place, they'd hang back and then you have the situation. Once the battles over that I'm talking about right now amongst other names, I heard that if coach and called and a female voice without being replied to the name struck me and I observed the poor woman who had called it, as she said, stopping, sobbing before us and apparently afraid to make further inquiries about her husband. No Man had answered to his name or had any given account to give of his fate.

Speaker 3:          00:36:10       I myself had observed him fall as related before whilst drinking from his canteen, but as I looked at the poor sobbing creature before me, I felt unable to tell her of his death at length. Captain Leach observed her and called out to the company. Does any man know what has happened to coach and if so, let him speak out at once upon this order, I immediately related what I had seen and told the manner of his death after a while and this coat Mrs. Coach and appeared anxious to seek the spot where her husband fell and in the hope of still finding him alive asked me to accompany her over the field. She trusted not withstanding what I had told her to find him yet alive.

Speaker 2:          00:36:56       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:36:57       Do you think you could find it said Captain Leech upon being referred to? I told them I was sure I could. As I had remarked, many objects waltzed looking for cover during the skirmishing go then said the captain and show the poor woman this spot as she seems so desirous of finding the body.

Speaker 2:          00:37:15       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:37:16       I accordingly took my way over the ground. We had fought upon she following and sobbing after me quickly reaching the spot where her husband's body lay pointed out to her.

Speaker 2:          00:37:27       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:37:27       she now discovered soon all her hopes were in vain. She embraced a stiffened corpse and after rising and contemplating his disbelief, disfigured face for some minutes with hands clasped and tears streaming down her cheeks, she took a prayer book from her pocket and kneeling down, repeated this service for the dead over the body.

Speaker 2:          00:37:53       Poor woman,

Speaker 3:          00:37:55       I pitied her much, but there was no remedy.

Speaker 2:          00:38:04       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:38:05       Whole new dynamic right there.

Speaker 2:          00:38:07       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          00:38:12       Continuing on back to the book, it was on the 21st of August that we commenced fighting the battle of Ramiro. The French came down upon us as a column and the rifleman immediately commenced a sharp fire upon them from whatever cover they could get a shelter behind while star Canon played upon them from our rear. I saw a regular little lanes torn through their ranks as they advanced, which were

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       immediately closed up again as they march steadily on. Whenever we saw a round shot, thus go through the mass, we raised a shout of delight. That's a savage image, right there. Ranks of men and there's cannon balls that are cutting lines through cutting lanes through them and you, you'd probably talking 2030 people killed each one and the ranks just close in around them and that's what these guys are seeing is this advanced takes place there. Continue through that battle. They get into a position for another battle. Going back to the book, as I looked about me whilst standing and ranked and just thought, and just before the commencement commencement of the battle, I thought it the most imposing site the world could produce our lines glittering with bright arms, the stern features of the men as they stood with their eyes fixed on alternately upon the enemy, the proud colors of England floating over the heads of the different battalions and the dark cannon on the rising ground and all in readiness to commence the awful work of deaf with a noise that would defin the whole multitude. Although the site had a singular and terrible effect upon the feelings of a youth who a few short months before had been a solitary shepard upon the downs of Dorsal pitcher and had never contemplated any other sort of life than the peaceful occupation of watching the innocent sheep as they fed upon the grassy turf.

Speaker 1:          00:40:13       Talk about a dichotomy. No fought in his mind other than watching sheep eat grass. I would think that that'd be kind of a good little escape, you know, from time to time to notice those types of things. Yes, I think you're right. And I think that happens in, you know, there's a movie called the thin red line and that's portrayed very well in all this chaos. He'll take cover and he'll be face to face with a flower or he'll notice a burger, a bug. And that's definitely, that's definitely something that people notice. I mean I noticed there's the sunset no matter where you are in the world. And actually the sunset and the deserts have very beautiful thing and same with the sunrise. And so those are little things that you notice even though you might not be in the mindset to notice them, you still notice them. Back to the book, the battle commencing immediately. We were all soon so hard at work, the rifles as usual or pretty busy in this battle. The French in great numbers came steadily down upon us and we pelted away upon them like a shower of led. Inhale under any cover we could find in lay firing. One moment, jumping up and running for it. The next and

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       when we could see before us, we observe the cannon balls making a lane through the enemy's columns as they advanced as they were [inaudible] and shouting like mad men.

Speaker 2:          00:41:47       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:41:48       The battle soon became general, the smoke thick into round and often I was obliged to stop firing and dash at aside from my face and try in vain to get a sight of what was going on whilst groans and shouts and annoys of candidate and musketry appeared almost to shake the very ground.

Speaker 2:          00:42:07       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:42:07       It seemed hell upon, or if I thought a man named John Lowe stood before me at this moment and he turned around during a pause in our exertions that he addressed me. Harris, you humbug. He said you've got plenty of money about you. I know for you to always staying about and picking up what you can find on the field, but I think this will be your last field day old boy. A good many of us will catch it, I suspect today.

Speaker 2:          00:42:34       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:42:34       you're right. Low. I said I've got nine guineas in my pack and if I am shocked today and you escape yourself, it's quite at your service. In the meantime, however, if you see any symptoms of my wishing to flinch in this business, I hope you will shoot me with your own hand.

Speaker 2:          00:42:54       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:42:55       blow Pitsa the, so let's think about that. That's, that's pretty awesome. First of all, the attitude of they're basically talking smack to each other. Yeah. Classic. Hey, I don't think you're gonna make it. I know you got a lot of money on you and if you don't make it, what do you say? Is that mine? Yes. If I die, come and get it. I got nine guineas and my pack. They're all years and then this is classic by the way, if you see me acting cowardly in any way, you better shoot me. Yeah, that's a legit low as well as myself survived this battle and after it was over, whilst we sat down with our comrades and rested amongst other matters, talked over low, told them of our conversation during the heat of the day and the money I'd collected and the rifles from that time to time had a great respect from me. It is indeed singular how a man loses or gains cast with his comrades from the behavior and how closely he is. He is observed on the battlefield. Again, talking about reputation. Once again, the officers to our commented upon and closely observed. Everyone's watching the officers. The men are very proud of those who are brave in the field and kind and considerate to the soldiers and under them.

Speaker 3:          00:44:14       An act of kindness done by an officer has often during battle been the cause of his life being saved, got a little relationship going. Hmm. Nay. Whatever folks may say upon the matter. I know from experience that in our army, the men liked best to be officer by gentlemen, men who's education has rendered them more kind in manners. Then your course officer sprung from obscure origin and who style is brutal and overbearing. So as I was reading through that, I at first I, I kinda got a little bit taken aback because I said, oh, what are you trying to say if you haven't been to college or a year that that's what you need. You need to be from this good upbringing. But that's not well that, that might be what he's saying at that time. But the important part is it's how you treat people.

Speaker 3:          00:45:05       It doesn't matter what background you came from, you know, he, he says men who's education has rendered them more kind of manners. And rather than someone that's from a, an obscure origin, what I'm telling you is it doesn't matter where you're from. And he would agree with this. Now if he was here to talk with me, of course, but it's not. He's talking about the p the men like to work for officers that aren't brutal and overbearing. No one likes that. Yeah, and you don't perform well. You want to build the relationship with your troops. The kindness done by an officer as often during the battle been the cause of his life being saved. That means guys are trying to win.

Speaker 2:          00:45:44       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:45:48       Back to the book and let me bear testimony to the courage and endurance of the, of that army under trials and hardships, such as few armies in any age I should think, endured. I've seen officers and men hobbling forward with tears in their eyes from the misery of long miles, empty stomachs and ragged backs without even shoes or stockings on their bleeding feet. And it was not a little thing that would bring a tear into the eyes of a rifleman of the peninsula wars youths who had not long been removed from their parents' home and care officers and men have borne hardships and privations such as in are more peaceful days. We have little conception of

Speaker 2:          00:46:37       okay,

Speaker 3:          00:46:38       and yet these men faint and weary with toil would brighten up in a moment when the word ran amongst us that the enemy we're at hand. Once again, he's ragging on you haven't really been to war lately. Peaceful days and

Speaker 2:          00:47:00       brutal

Speaker 3:          00:47:02       privations that these guys go through and yet they're still ready to step up. Back to the book. It was just at the close of the battle. The dreadful turmoil and noise of the engagement had hardly subsided and I began to look at the faces of the men close around me to see who had escaped the dangers of the hour. I saw that the ranks of the rifleman looked very thin. It seemed to me that one half had gone down.

Speaker 2:          00:47:27       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:47:27       We had four companies with fifth and we're commanded that day by major Travers. He was a man much liked by the men of the rifles and indeed deservedly beloved by all who knew him. He was a tight hand, but a soldier likes that better than a slovenly officer.

Speaker 3:          00:47:47       Pay attention to that one. Don't be a Slovenly leader. They the troops prefer the tight hand. Back to the book. I'd observed him more than once during this day, spring here and they're keeping the men well up and apparently in the highest spirits he could not have enjoyed himself more. I am sure if he had been at a horse race or following a good pack of hounds. The battle is just over. A flag of truce came from, came over from the French. We threw ourselves down when we were standing. When the fire ceased, a Frenchman Lake close beside me, he was dying and called to me for water, which I understood him to require more from his manner that his words.

Speaker 2:          00:48:29       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:48:29       I need not say that I got up and gave it to him whilst I did so down Gallup, the major in front Justin, the same good spirits he'd been in all day plugging along, avoiding with some little difficulty, the dead and dying, which were strewn about.

Speaker 2:          00:48:46       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:48:46       He was never a very good looking man, being hard featured and thin, a hatchet face man as we used to say, but he was irregular Gooden, a real English soldier, and that's better than if he had been the handsomest ladies man in the army.

Speaker 2:          00:49:06       Legit, totally legit.

Speaker 3:          00:49:13       Back to the book of French, a French soldier was lying beside me at this time. He was badly wounded in hearing him Moen as he lay. After I had done looking at the cavalry, I turned my attention to him and getting up, lifted his head and poured some water into his mouth. He was dying fast, but he thanked me in a foreign language, which although I did not exactly understand, I could easily make out by the look. He gave me Mullins of the rifles who stepped up whilst I supported his head. Dammed me for a fool, for my pain's better. Knock out his brain's Harris. He said he's done os mischief enough. I'll be bound for it today. So right from the Harris is still a pretty sympathetic dude.

Speaker 2:          00:49:57       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          00:50:00       Back to the book towards evening I posted upon arising ground amongst a clump of tall trees. There seem to have been a sharp skirmish. Here is three French men were lying dead amongst the long grass upon the spot where I was standing, as I threw my rifle to my shoulder and walked past them on my beat, I observed they had been plundered and there have her sacs having been torn off. Some of the contents were scattered about

Speaker 3:          00:50:25       war is a sad blunter of the feelings. I have often thought since those days the contemplation of three ghastly bodies in this lonely spot failed then in making the slightest impression upon me, the site had become even in the short time I had been engaged in the trade, but too familiar and now they're another truce kind of happens and he's observing the scene in this churchyard. The scene in this church yard was somewhat singular. Two long tables had been procured from some houses near and were placed end to and amongst the graves and upon them we laid the men who's limbs it was found necessary to amputate both French and English. We're constantly lifted on and off these tables. As soon as the operation was performed upon one lot, they were carried off and in. In those waiting behind, we're always stood up. The surgeons with their sleeves turned up and their hands and arms covered in blood looking like butchers in the shambles.

Speaker 2:          00:51:34       Okay?

Speaker 3:          00:51:34       I saw as I passed, at least 20 legs lying on the ground. Many of them being clothed in the long black gators then worn by the infantry line.

Speaker 2:          00:51:44       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:51:44       The surgeons had plenty of work on hand that day and not having the time to take the clothes off the wounded. They merely rip the seams and turn the cough back proceeding with the operation as fast as they could.

Speaker 2:          00:51:58       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:51:58       Many of the wounded came straggling into this church yard and search of assistance by themselves. I saw one man faint with Ross of blood staggering along and turned to assist him.

Speaker 2:          00:52:09       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:52:10       He was severely wounded in the head. His face being completely encrusted with blood, which had flowing during the night. Now dried one eyeball was knocked out of the socket and hung down upon his cheek.

Speaker 2:          00:52:24       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:52:24       But another man I observed who had been brought in and propped up against a grave mound, he seemed very badly hurt. The men who had carried him into the church yard had placed his cap, filled with the fragments of biscuit close beside his head and he lay and the and occasionally turned his mouth towards it. Got a hold of a piece of biscuit and munched it.

Speaker 2:          00:52:46       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:52:47       As I was about to leave the church yard doctor Ridgeway, one of the surgeons called me back to assist with holding a man he was endeavoring to operate upon.

Speaker 2:          00:52:56       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:52:57       Come and help me with this man. He said where I shall be all day cutting a ball out of his shoulder.

Speaker 2:          00:53:03       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:53:04       The patient's name was doubter, an Irishman. He disliked the doctor's efforts and writhed and twisted so much during the operation that it was with difficulty. Doctor Ridgeway could perform it.

Speaker 2:          00:53:16       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:53:16       He found it necessary to cut very deep and doubter made a terrible outcry at every fresh incision. Oh, doctor dear doctor said, it's murdering me. You are blood and hounds, I shall die. I shall die for the love of the Lord. Don't cut me all to pieces. Doubter was not altogether wrong for although he survived the operation, he died shortly thereafter from the effects of his wounds.

Speaker 2:          00:53:49       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:53:49       Again, you just got surgeons mixing blood and not clean and not even cutting off clothes or sterilizing. I mean the, the amount of people that must have lost from the infections after the fact is just crazy

Speaker 3:          00:54:09       now. They weren't fighting all the time and at this point they are quartered in a house in Spain. And again, Spain was divided at the time and there was friendly and enemy span Spain. And so they're quartered in a house and there's a family there. And here we go to the book, the mistress of the house. Seeing that I was the head man occasionally came down and sat beside me as I worked, bringing her daughter, a very handsome, dark eyed Spanish girl. And as a matter of course I fell in love. We soon became better acquainted and the mother one evening having sat and chatted to me, serving me with wine and other good things on my rising to leave the shop, made a signal for me to follow her. She had managed to pick up a little English and I knew a few words. It's Spanish language so that we could pretty well comprehend each other's meeting. And after leading me into their sitting room, she brought in her handsome daughter and without more circumstance offered her to me for a wife.

Speaker 2:          00:55:11       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:55:12       The offer was attempting one, but the conditions of the marriage made it impossible for me to comply. Since I was to change my religion and dessert, my colors, the old Dame proposed to conceal me effectually when the army marched after which I was to live like a gentlemen with the handsome Maria for a wife.

Speaker 2:          00:55:32       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:55:33       It was hard to refuse. So tempting an offer with pretty Maria endeavoring to back her mother's proposal.

Speaker 2:          00:55:40       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:55:40       Hi. However, made them understand that nothing would tempt me to dessert and promising to try and get my discharge. When I returned to England, I protested. I would then return and Mary Maria.

Speaker 2:          00:55:54       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:55:54       Soon after this, the army marched for Spain.

Speaker 2:          00:55:57       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:55:58       The rifles paraded in the very street where the shop I had so long worked at was situated. And I saw Maria at the window as our Buechel struck up, she waved her handkerchief. I returned the salute.

Speaker 2:          00:56:15       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:56:16       And, and a half an hour had forgotten all about her

Speaker 3:          00:56:19       so much for the soldiers. Love that. I read that and I said, I have to read this. This is to every 18, 1920 and 21 year old service member out there that you meet the girl your dreams and you've, you've do you think you're gonna do some dumb stuff? Don't do the dumb stuff. Go back to your platoon and in a half an hour you'll forget about her because that's what happens. Yeah. Such so much for a soldiers. Love [inaudible] back to the book. Every man in the rifle seemed only anxious to get a wrap at the French again.

Speaker 2:          00:57:00       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:57:01       on and on. We toiled. I love to remember the appearance of that army as we moved along at this time. It was a glorious sight to see our color spread in these fields. The men seemed invincible. Nothing I fought could have beaten them.

Speaker 2:          00:57:17       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:57:18       Now he's talking about a guy named Cardo. He was found to be most gallon officer when we were engaged with the enemy in the field. He was killed whilst fighting bravely in the peer knees and amongst other jewelry he wore. He had a ring on his finger wharf, 150 guineas as he laid dead on the field, one of our rifle rifleman named or observe the sparkling gem and immediately resolved to make a prize of it. The ring, however, was so firmly fixed that or could not draw it from the finger and whipping out his knife, cut the finger off at the joint after the battle or offered the ring for sale amongst the officers and on inquiry. The manner in which he had obtained it transpired or Wisconsin or wasn't consequence tried by court marshal and sent us to receive 500 lashes.

Speaker 2:          00:58:13       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:58:13       Which sentence is carried into execution? There's some significant corporal punishment going on here with the, with the lashes and that's one of the cases mean what do you know when you're executing someone for being drunk and disorderly, you're going to get some pretty severe punishment for cutting the finger off of one of your officers so you can steal their ring.

Speaker 2:          00:58:35       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:58:39       Back to the book, it was during the heat of the day. We were rather hotly pressed by the enemy after having advanced somewhat to near their force, give and take is all fair enough. But we were getting more kicks than half pence as the saying is. And their balls stung a so sharply that the officers gave the word to fire and retire.

Speaker 3:          00:58:58       Doubtless many got a leaden messenger as they did so, which saved them the unpleasant necessity of retracing their ground altogether. Jock Gillespie and myself wheeled about and obeyed the order just as we had done. So I saw Gillespie limp along as though someone had bestowed a violent kick upon his person. However, he didn't give up at first, but continued to load and fire and make off with other skirmishers skirmishers till we halted and made another stand for. We never went further from them when once engaged than we could possibly help. I'm going to read that again.

Speaker 2:          00:59:41       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:59:42       We continued to load and fire and make off with other skirmishes till we halted and made another stand for. We never went further from them when once engaged than we could possibly help. And what that means is cover move. Hmm. So if you are out on the battlefield and you get too far away from the other element where you can no longer support them, you've made a big mistake. So that's why they have doctrinal terms. That mean I am in supporting distance. I won't go further away from you then. Then we're going where I can't help you. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:00:26       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:00:27       All right. Now speaking of lashings, there's another situation here. There was sort of a a ceremony where they were gathering and standing in the parade sort of in a, in a town square and somebody basically through, I think like a brick at, it's one of the soldiers from one of the windows that was watching the other regiment. So there's one regimen standing on the parade field handing out awards or something. The other regimens sitting up in the various rooms around looking down and at some point this this someone hawks a brick down and it hits the kernel. So this Guy Liston was the guy that they, they grab and they think it's this guy list back to the book and was sentenced to receive 800 lashes. The whole brigade turned out on the occasion and I remembered that the drummers of the Ninth Regiment where the infliction of the lash list and list and receive the whole sentence without a murmur.

Speaker 3:          01:01:35       This is the him talking about as he goes on to talk about how this strict discipline about it and how it kind of fits in with the English mentality back to the book. They are strange set the English and so determined an unconquerable that they will have their way if they can think about that. You got your soldiers there, so it's a great quality to have, right? You're, you're determined and unconquerable but what does that mean? It means you're going to have your way if you can and if you let them, they're going to get after. It may be that the way you don't expect. Yeah, indeed. Back to the book, it indeed it requires one who has authority in his face as well as add as back to make respect and obey him. They see too often in the instance of sergeant majors that command does not suit ignorant and course minded men and that tyranny is too much used even in the brief authority which they have. So again, he's going back to the fact that even though you have to have these talking about the dichotomy of leadership, even though you have to have discipline, you can't have tyranny back to the book. A soldier I am convinced is driven often to insubordination by being worried by these little minded men for the various, the various trifles about which the gentlemen never thinks of tormenting him. So the this, the, the,

Speaker 3:          01:03:02       the little minded person that harps on these little trifling things and that's what actually creates insubordination whereas the gentleman never thinks of tormenting him with these little things like these little things don't matter. The, and then he goes on to balance this dichotomy of leadership. Back to the book of the moment. The severity of the discipline of our army has relaxed, in my opinion, farewell to its efficiency. But for men to be tormented about trifles as I've seen it many times, is often very injurous to the whole core. So this is the perfect talking about the balance of the dichotomy of leadership. If you're to ultra strict, you're guys are going to rebel against you. And if you're not strict enough, if you don't impose enough discipline, they're going to not have any control. So you got to balance these two going forward. Back to the book. War is a sad blunt or of the feelings of men. He said that before and he's saying it again. We felt we felt eager to be added again. Nay. I am afraid we longed for blood as the chair of our comrades sounded in our ears and yet amidst all this softer feelings occasionally filled the breasts of those gallant fellows even whilst they were thirsting for the site of the enemy.

Speaker 3:          01:04:26       Some of the men near me, suddenly Rico recollected as they saw the snow line physically on our pass path that this was Christmas Eve. The recollection soon spread amongst the men and many talked of home and scenes upon that night in the other days of old England shedding tears as they spoke of the roulette relatives and friends never to be seen again by them. As night approached, we became less talkative. The increasing weariness of our limbs kept our tongues quieter and we were many of us half asleep as we walked when suddenly a shout arose in the front that the French were upon us.

Speaker 2:          01:05:06       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:05:07       so guys are missing home. It's Christmas Eve. Nice little dusting of snow on the ground there. They have this skirmish with a French there and now they're continuing continuing the first march. And if you remember the march that the, that we talked about with Napoleon's troops going into Russia and back, these guys are under the same basic conditions of if you want to move the army, the army's going to walk back to the book of Sergeant of the night. So the, so he's now on this also. He not only, they are forced marching right now, they're starting to retreat. They're starting to do, they, they're starting to take heavies and they start uh, uh, uh, retreat back to the book. A sergeant of the 92nd highlanders just about this time fell dead with fatigue and no one stopped as we pass to offer him any assistance.

Speaker 2:          01:05:58       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:05:58       Knight came down upon us. So those, think about that and this, I highlighted that one, but throughout this book he talks about people just dying and he says they died a fatigue. I don't even know what that means actually. Maybe they're dehydrated. I don't know. But if you think about these guys who are risking their lives for each other, how exhausted are they that when someone falls out during this first march, the forced march, they just leave them there back to the book night came down upon us without our having tasted food or halted. I speak for myself and those around me all and all night long we continued this dreadful march. Men began to look into each other's faces and ask the questions, ask the question, are we ever to be halted again? And many of the week restore, we're now seeing to stagger, make a few desperate efforts and then fall perhaps to rise no more.

Speaker 2:          01:06:51       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:06:52       Most of us had devoured all we carried in or have or sacks and each and and and endeavored to catch up. Anything we could snatch from a hut or cottage in our route. Many even at this period would have straggled from the ranks and perished had not. Crawford held them together with a, from rain, one such bold and stern commander in the east during a memorable disaster and that devoted army had reached its refuge on broken. Thus we staggered on night and day for about four days before we discovered the reason of this forced march.

Speaker 2:          01:07:30       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:07:31       And they find out that they're marching actually towards England. They're trying to get away. And this a guy that I talked about, Crawford, he's pretty significant. And here's a little talk about Crawford. Crawford seem to sniff the sound of battle from afar with Pq your feelings. He halted us for a few minutes. Occasionally when the distant clamor became more distinct and his face turned toward the sound and seem to light up and become less stern, it was then indeed that every poor fellow clutched his weapon more firmly and wished for a site of the enemy before long they had their wish. The enemy's calvary. We're on our skirts that night. And as we rushed out of a small village, we turned to bay. So even though they're retreating, they're still having to fight. And this again, this guy, Crawford, is definitely a powerful leader. Back to the book, I remember one evening during the retreat, he detected two men straying away from the main body. It was in the early stage of that disastrous flight. And Crawford knew.

Speaker 2:          01:08:41       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:08:42       and Crawford knew well that he must do his utmost to keep the division together. He halted the brigade with a voice of Thunder, ordered a drum head court martial on the instant and they were sentenced to a hundred a piece. Whilst a hasty trial was taking place, Crawford dismounting from his horse stood in the midst looking stern and angry as a worried bulldog.

Speaker 2:          01:09:06       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:09:06       he did not like retreating at all. That man. They march a little bit further and then back to the book ordering a square to be formed. He spoke to the brigade as well as I can remember in these words, after having ordered the three before named man of the 95th to be brought into the square.

Speaker 3:          01:09:28       Although he said I should obtain the goodwill, neither of the officers nor the men of the brigade here. By doing so, I am resolved to punish these three men according to the sentence awarded, even though the French are at our heels, begin with Daniel Howard's. So these guys were looked like they were going to dessert and they got caught and he got a court martial on the spot and going to give them a hundred lashes or whatever the number was, and even though they're running and retreating, he's all right. We're going, we're going to administer this punishment now, even though it's not popular. I got to do it back to the book. This was indeed no time to be lax and disciplined in the general knew it. The men, as I said, where some of them becoming careless and roughing and Lee and their demeanor whilst others, again, I saw with my, with the tears falling down their cheeks from the agony of their bleeding feet and many were ill with dysentery and from the effects of bad food they had got ahold of and devoured on the road.

Speaker 3:          01:10:34       Our knapsacks too. We're a bitter enemy in this prolonged march. Many a man died. I'm convinced who would have borne up well to the end of the retreat, but for the infernal load we carried on our backs. My own knapsack was my bitterest enemy. I felt it pressed me to the earth almost at times and more than once felt as if I should die under its deadly embrace. The knapsacks, in my opinion, she have been abandoned at the very commencement of the Retro Gate Movement as it would've been better to have lost them all together. If by such loss we could have saved the poor fellows who as it was dyed strapped

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       to them on the road. There was some difficulty in finding a place to tie how ends up as the light brigade carried no Halbert's. However they led them to a slender ash tree, which grew near at hand. Don't trouble yourselves about tying me up. Set Howland's folding his arms. I'll take my punishment like a man.

Speaker 2:          01:11:37       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:11:38       he did. So without a murmur receiving the whole 300. His wife who is present with us, I remember was a strong hardy Irish woman.

Speaker 1:          01:11:51       So don't worry about tying be up. You hit me 300 times. We add, uh, you know, they do the whipping thing with the, when you get your belt, do you remember? Do you remember Irish? John, can you tall? Pretty lanky and real good at Jujitsu and he got his blue belt and he walked through the whipping hallway to get his belt, but got the gauntlet. He Wa he walked through the gauntlet. He just walked and stopped at each person and gave them the opportunity to give them all they got. Yeah, that was pretty legit. He sounds like he sounds like he sounds like my boy. Howland's right here. More about Crawford right here. This is classic. They're, they're getting to a river. They got across the river on their retreat back to the book. Presently, he spied an officer who to save himself from being wet through I suppose and wearing a damn pair of breaches for the remainder of the day had mounted on the back of one of his men,

Speaker 1:          01:12:57       the site of such a piece of a feminist. He was enough to raise the color of the general and in a very short time he was plunging and splashing through the water. After them both put him down, sir, put him down. I desire you to put that officer down instantly and the soldier in an instant, I dare say loft dropping his burden like a hot potato into the stream, continued his progress through, returned back, sir, said Crawford to the officer and go through the water like the others. I will not allow my officers to ride upon the men's back through the rivers. All must take their share of like here. You can just go ahead and note that down is how to lead. That's just the, that's a metaphorical and literal example. Hey, I'm going to ride on the back of my enlisted man so that I can stay dry. What a savage. I think that that guy should have guns will ashes back to the book. General Crawford was indeed one of the few men who is apparently created for the command during such dreadful scenes as we were familiar with in this retreat. He seemed an iron man. Nothing daunted him, nothing turned him from his purpose. War was his very element and toil and danger seemed to call forth and increasing determination to surmount them.

Speaker 2:          01:14:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:14:21       Would you yet? Now they are continuing to March and again it's, it's a story we've heard many times on here and how harsh foot marches can be and at this point, rifleman Harris, he's, he doesn't think he's going to make it. Hmm. And he's fading fast. He's marching with a guy named Brooks. They're kind of broken up into pairs to try and stay together a little bit and he's trying to maintain back to the book. I remember Sir Dudley Hill passing me on a mule this day. He wore a Spanish straw hat and had his cloak on. He looked back when he had passed and addressed me. Harris said, he,

Speaker 1:          01:15:05       I see you cannot keep up. He peered very sorry for me for he knew me well, you must do your best. He said, my man and keep up with us or you will fall into the hands of the enemy. As the day wore on, I grew weaker and weaker and at last spite all of my efforts I saw the main body leave me hopelessly in the lurch. Brooks himself was getting weaker too. He saw it was of little use to urge me on and at length assenting to my repeated requests to be left behind. He hurried on as well and he was able without a word of farewell.

Speaker 2:          01:15:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:15:47       I now soon sink down in the road and lay beside another man who had also fallen, was apparently dead and whom might recognized as one of our sergeants named Taylor.

Speaker 2:          01:16:03       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:16:06       Whilst we lay exhausted in the road, the rear guard, which was now endeavoring to drive on the stragglers approached and a sergeant of the rifles came up and stopped and look at us. He dressed himself to me and ordered me to rise, but I told them it was a useless for him to trouble himself about me as I was unable to move a step further.

Speaker 2:          01:16:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:16:28       Whilst he was urging me to endeavor to rise up, the officer in command of the rear guard also stepped up. The name of this officer was Lieutenant Cox. He was a brave and good man and observing at the sergeant was rough in his language and manner towards me. He silenced him and bade the guard proceed and leave me.

Speaker 2:          01:16:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:16:48       Let Him die quietly. Hicks, he said to the sergeant, I know him well. He's not Amanda lie here. If he could get on.

Speaker 2:          01:16:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:16:56       I'm sorry. Harris Harris. He said to see you reduced to this for I fear there is no help to be had now.

Speaker 2:          01:17:05       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:17:05       He then moved on after his men and me to my feet.

Speaker 2:          01:17:12       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:17:14       Lot different than never leave a man behind. You've actually got people just saying, hey, you're not going to make it do. I can see you're not going to make it. I know you're a tough guy and if you're not, if we're not walking right now, there isn't. We've got nothing for you on now. He lays there for awhile and he actually, once he rests for awhile, he regains a little bit of strength, eventually crawls to a house, gets in the house and gets a little bit of food, gets a little bit of a, I would love to say water but isn't get water. He gets food and wine and he recovers somewhat. He pretty much recovers. Um, sleeps for awhile. Wakes up, recovers and now he can now he can walk again. And what do you think would happen now? Like in a case as similar to this as possible?

Speaker 1:          01:18:06       You know, but just now we're at, I can't make it. What do you do? Carry him? Yeah. I mean you'd try and carry him. Of course. Other guys. Got It. Yeah. And I mean it's horrible to think of these situations where if we have to move these all these men and to sit there, if we start, let's, let's weigh this. You'd have to weigh this. If we try and carry all over wounded out, none of us are going to live. Right. So that, that's what the, that's the situation that they're likely facing. Hey, you're either gonna get Outta here yourself and people don't understand how hard it is to carry it down, man. It's, it's a very, very difficult to carry it down, man. Especially across terrain. Then you know, sometime in wrestling practice you pick up and you pick up your partner and you do a couple laps.

Speaker 1:          01:18:53       Right. And Yeah, you know, it's all good. You're honest, nice smooth surface. The guys cooperating, cooperating is not just dead weight. It's, yeah, when you start carrying bodies around, it's really, really difficult. Yeah. So you don't, it's not a one-to-one either. So if one guy's down you can't, it's not just one person carries that guy. It actually has to be two or sometimes three when you have gear on. Yeah. And we have methods of carrying guys. I mean, well I can carry you a little while, right? Yeah. But after a little while, you know, be that 500 meters, a thousand meters, you're not going to be your, and also your combat ineffective. You can't, you can't utilize your weapon properly. Not for, not for any length of time. So you know, in a situation like this that the decision that these leaders are making is, hey, guess what, if we don't just keep walking, we're going to get overrun, the French are going to catch us and we're all going to die. So Harris, he got nothing for you. So in countries like now we'll say if there was a circumstance like that where we're going to lose more guys, if we bring this guy with us or one big luxury that we have now is we have f air support. Yeah. So, oh, the enemy wants to keep coming at us.

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       Cool. We'll sit here and call, drop bombs on them all day. Situations like that have happened over and over again in the modern wars. And when in the eight, Iraq and Afghanistan were small elements are out there in the field. They're about to get overrun and the aircraft and air, air, fire, uh, air power comes in and completely saves the day and keeps the enemy at bay for extended periods of time. So we have, uh, an option, another option, but in the, I guess ultimately it'd be a hypothetical then the case hypothetically, we then, then you got to put someone in that situation and see what they're gonna do. And that's a decision you've got to make as well as a leader and an on the spot. I mean, you, you'd be weighing all these micro micro facets that are happening. How far away are the bad guys? How many of them are there? Do I have reinforcements coming? Is there any terrain I can take is or what, you know, what can I do? How many people are down? Yeah. You have to weigh all these things out and make a decision and it's going to be a hard decision for sure.

Speaker 4:          01:21:07       So you don't put like the, the, the concept or should I say, um, like the action of at least trying to bring the guy with you ahead of like other guys lives. So you need a circumstance like this where you hypothetically, you don't have any content, you don't have any support, you don't have any other options. It's either other guys die or the where we leave this guy behind. The fact that you tried to bring the guy doesn't Trump like the lives of other guys where if the decision is to be made where it's understood like other guys would have died if we didn't leave this guy here, that would be okay.

Speaker 3:          01:21:52       It's not going to be okay and you're going to have to live with one horrible, right thought or the other. Right, right. The the thing that's powerful about, we're not going to leave everything anyone behind. The thing that's powerful about that is if that's your, if that's your default mode, your default mode is to fight. And that's what, that's, that's what we train. That's when I say we, I mean like America trains, we're not going to leave you behind. And so when that's your goto attitude, that's your go to attitude and all the thoughts about, hey, we'll weigh it out and all of a sudden there's like, no, we're going to fight. We're going to kill everyone and we're going to, we're going to do everything we can to, to bring everyone back. That's what we do. And that is a powerful thing. Yeah, man, these are savage times. These are savage times. Savage Time's going. So like I said, he does recover though. Luckily before the French get to him, he recovers enough to get out, start walking again, and he talks a little bit how he was clinging. I mean he was clinging to survival back to the book. It is however, indeed astonishing how a man clings to life. I am certain that had I laid down at this period, I should have found my last bill on the spot I sank upon.

Speaker 3:          01:23:08       Suddenly I heard a shout in the front, which was prolonged in a sort of hub hub. Even the stragglers whom I saw dotting the road in front of me seemed to have caught something like hope. And as the poor fellows now reached the top of the hill we're sending, I heard an occasional exclamation of joy. The first note of the sort I'd heard from any days.

Speaker 2:          01:23:30       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:23:30       When I reached the top of the hill, the thing spoke for itself. They're far away in our front. The English shipping lay in.

Speaker 2:          01:23:40       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:23:40       It's a view had indeed acted like a restorative, uh, to our force and the men at the prospect of the termination of such a march had plucked up spirit for a last effort.

Speaker 2:          01:23:56       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:23:56       Fellows who like myself seemed hardly have strengthened their legs to creep up the ascent seem now to have picked up a fresh pair to get down with

Speaker 2:          01:24:07       okay.

Speaker 3:          01:24:07       Such as hope to us pour mortals. So they obviously see the uh, see the ships and that inspires them and they start moving a little bit faster. Back to the book, there was I recollect a man of the name of Belle of the rifles who had been during this day holding a sort of creeping race with me. We had passed and repassed each other as our strength served. Bell was a rather discontented fellow at the best of times, but during this retreat he had given full scope. Two is ill temper, cursing the hour he was born and wishing his mother had strangled him when he came into the world in order to have saved him from his present toil.

Speaker 2:          01:24:51       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:24:51       He had not now spoken for some time and the site of the English shipping had apparently a very beneficial effect upon him.

Speaker 2:          01:25:00       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:25:01       He burst into tears as he stood and looked at it. Harris. He said, if it pleases God to let me reach those ships, I swear never to utter a bad or discontented word again, appreciation. And he did make it to the ships and Harris Rifleman. Harris made it to the ships and

Speaker 2:          01:25:25       okay,

Speaker 3:          01:25:25       they got embarked on those ships and they sailed back to England.

Speaker 2:          01:25:32       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:25:32       For a few days and then get off the English shore and then finally back to the book. One fine morning received orders to disembark and our poor bare feet once more touched English ground.

Speaker 2:          01:25:46       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:25:46       The inhabitants flock down to the beach to see us as we did so. And they must have been a good deal. Surprised at the spectacle we presented.

Speaker 2:          01:25:56       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:25:56       Our beards were long and ragged, almost all were without shoes and stockings. Many had their clothes and accoutrements in fragments with their heads. Swathed in old rags and our weapons were covered with rust whilst not a few had now from toil and fatigue become quite blind.

Speaker 2:          01:26:16       Okay,

Speaker 3:          01:26:17       let not the reader, however think that now we, we were to be despised as soldiers, long marches, inclement weather and want to food had done their work upon us, but we were perhaps better than we are appeared as the sequel showed under the gallon. Crawford, we had made some tremendous marches and even Gal Dar enemies so severely making good our retreat.

Speaker 2:          01:26:43       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:26:44       But our comrades and adversity who had retired by the other road under general more turn to bay there and show the enemy that the English soldier is not to be beaten even under the most adverse circumstances, the field of death and slaughter, the march, the BIVOUAC and the retreat are no bad places in which to judge men. I have had some opportunities of judging them in all these situations. And I should say that the British are amongst the most splendid soldiers in the world. Give them fair play and they are unconquerable.

Speaker 2:          01:27:25       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:27:26       For my own part, I can only say that I enjoyed life more whilst on active service than I have ever done since.

Speaker 2:          01:27:35       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:27:36       And as I sit at work in my shop in Richmond Street, so Ho I look back upon that portion of my time spent in the fields of the peninsula as the only part worthy of remembrance it is at such times that scene's long past come back upon my mind as if they had taken place. But yesterday I remember even the appearance of some regiments engaged and comrades, long molder to dust. I see again performing the acts of heroes, acts, heroes, and I think it's

Speaker 2:          01:28:39       okay.

Speaker 3:          01:28:39       Safe to call riflemen Benjamin Randall Harris I hero as well.

Speaker 2:          01:28:50       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:28:53       And at the same time,

Speaker 2:          01:28:56       yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:28:57       I think it's important to remember that these,

Speaker 1:          01:29:00       Yep. These men, these heroes, they're not superheroes like we see today in movies. They don't wear a cape. They don't have any super human strength. They have no special powers. What they do have is they have will.

Speaker 2:          01:29:23       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:29:24       The will to fight the will to drive on the will to live the will to win. And I think that's the superpower. They knew. It never ceases to amaze me. These aren't normal people. Riflemen Harris was normal guy.

Speaker 4:          01:29:54       My costs,

Speaker 1:          01:29:58       but when called upon to March, they march and when called upon to fight, they fight and when called upon to rise up and overcome, they do just that they rise up and overcome.

Speaker 2:          01:30:19       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:30:22       And that shows us that we can do the same thing in the Fallon, in the challenges that we face. We can do the same thing.

Speaker 2:          01:30:37       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:30:38       Briars and overcome. And I think that's all I've got for tonight. So Echo perhaps if you could let people know how they can support themselves and maybe if they want to support this podcast as well. It's crazy. Huh?

Speaker 4:          01:31:07       These marches, right? Brutal. Yeah. And this is, uh, I dunno, maybe no. From what I can remember, the, the worst one that when you, especially how they talk about it with no shoes to shoes, their shoes probably just fall off within the first, you know, a little bit. And then they're walking with no shoes or barely any shoes or whatever. Crying straight up just from the march, by the way. Yeah. Not the, not the war or anything like that where the marches yet

Speaker 1:          01:31:36       just as big of an enemy. He said his pack was his biggest enemy. He had literally though the kind of work guys are strapped, killing them, killing them, killing them.

Speaker 4:          01:31:48       So we, we just got back from Utah obviously and um, you know, after every we're doing that training where we brief debrief reco down, exercise B and then, you know, we've walked back and forth. Right. Okay. So, okay, so echo, I'll just tell people these people have no idea what you're talking about, which is fine. Echo, we just got echelon front, did a FTX field training exercise with the company we were in Utah. We brought echo out so that he could get some footage and whatnot. And so then, so that's what we're talking about. So we're in the field, we're doing basically urban combat with a group of, let's call them regular people, business people that are learning leadership through experiential environments. It's an interesting one is a good one. It's like the, it's like a con, you know how if you don't communicate with someone effectively, right, things fall apart.

Speaker 4:          01:32:49       I know exactly what you're going to say is drawn out situation in life. But this is like a condense version of that. Yes. So if you don't communicate with someone during an Ftx, it do, you know, within like 30 seconds that something just went wrong. And now we're getting shot in the face with a, with air soft rifles. It's just fun. It's really fun to watch from the outside cause do you see it? And I've been to another one too. Um, and yeah, you see it. It's right. And it's interesting how in the beginning it's like, it's almost impossible. Like he don't, right. And immediately communication breaks down immediately and then towards the end you start to see people communicating, getting it. You know, like when you kind of got to overcommunicate. Yeah, for sure. But the more you do that, the more effective it is.

Speaker 4:          01:33:36       You know, it's so crazy to watch. It is an, I don't know if you remember Dave saying this, Dave told them, he said, Jocko just told you the mistakes that you're going to make. You told you what you're going to do and you're going to do it. And then sure enough, every single one of them, the funniest was the one individual that said, they came up with a plan for something and we said, you know your risk and get a blue, a blue on blue there. Yeah. And she said, she said, listen, I understand what you're saying, but it's not like we're going to walk in there and start shooting each other. That's not going to happen. And, and sure enough, that very girl was in a stressful situation and they entered a building from two different sides at the same time. And sure enough, she, she dusted one of her, one of her teammates and it was, you know, it's one of those things I said, hey, remember what you said yesterday? She said, Oh yeah, I remember.

Speaker 4:          01:34:32       And I had the luxury of seeing it from the outside. You can feel it though. Oh yeah. But you're in a different situation position than me. Anyway, the point is, um, so the terrain there was, um, where the field and where you, where you actually do the, the field training part of it is like, well what would you say 100 yards away from the pre where you do the brief and debrief has about 400 yards. Yeah. Yeah. So it's, it's a little bit of three, 300 yards out. If you're doing it again in the animal, we're going brief exercise, debrief, brief exit, you know, kind of all day. Really. So, and this was a situation where there, it was a hill and rocky, you know, so I'm walking right and I have my camera the whole time and it's not, it's lighter than my other accountant, but you know, it's something.

Speaker 4:          01:35:23       Um, and so I'm walking back and forth all day, all day, where my feet are starting to get kind of tired, more tired than normal. And I'm thinking every but every single time. Now, every single time I'm thinking, this is nothing compared to what you guys was going to do. Nothing. How nothing it was. I didn't, that didn't even go into my mind at all in any way, shape or form. You don't, what's interesting about that is while I'm walking, this was like after lunchtime, I'm thinking, I'm seeing you guys and everyone's Cruzee and, and I'm thinking is everyone tried to act like this isn't like Kinda kinda tired. Literally didn't think of it until you said this to me right now. The biggest I was, I was wholly acting like, fuck, this is nothing. And I wasn't going to mention it. I was going to brought, that's how I handle a lot of stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:36:05       That's good. And it helps him. But the fact is true. You do actually better when you pretend that it doesn't bother. Yes. I remember that night and day and night and night and day. So we started acting all tired and accepting it and showing everyone. Yeah, it's true. But nonetheless, the fact is it wasn't nothing. It wasn't nothing. I felt it and you know, um, so it's funny, I'm looking at you guys something like, Hey, I wonder if these guys are, you know, um, but no one said anything. Nobody said, Dang, these tracks are getting long, 300 meters bro.

Speaker 4:          01:36:44       But nonetheless, so every time I feel anything like that I think of like you guys first and you guys are doing it in like crazy heat to gear and like all this stuff. And I think that this kind of guys, these gang guys, yeah. Riflemen Harris Riflemen Harris feet all tore up starving, starving, starving, no sleep, no water, no water. And people are trying to kill you. Oh yeah. So that's the point, man. If these guys can rise and overcome that, what figure your personal potential. Yeah. Right. Yeah, take of it. I think of what more you could do. Yeah. That bothers you a little bit. I just saw the look and bothersome you guys. That looks like I made some dope videos though. I'm about to make a huge excuse right now too, which I don't even know if it's an excuse, but it's a factor where these like hard, actual hard times kind of call on you to, to exercise this kind of will, you know? And I think a lot of times we're not like hard times, don't call on us like this anyway. I mean hard times do you know? But you know what though? You know what though it,

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       you should put, I mean technically and potentially you should be able to exercise as much. We'll as it takes really now when you consider kind of the limit, because these are the lemmings are the limits. This is interesting. This is the, this is one of the stories where the guy's like, I'm done. Yeah. He said, okay, I'm done. Guys are saying, Hey, if you stay here, you're going to die. He's like, yeah, I cannot move anymore. Then when you think about, you know what, what point are you at when you cannot save your own life by walking, you can't walk, can't take another step. And he came back from that. Yeah. Yeah. And they told a really good job in illustrating it. Cause you were talking about it where, cause you mentioned the no shoes thing a few times. Yeah he did. But again, I bet if, yeah, yeah, he's, he does a great job, but you can't even begin to, can't even begin to really get the point across because the way it is as the leader, I was talking to a guy the other day that went to buds and didn't make it through.

Speaker 1:          01:39:04       Yeah. And I known him for awhile and I just said like, hey man, you know, you're a good dude. You know what, why did you, why did you quit? And he said, you know, it just sucked. And I was like, okay, but didn't, you know it was going to suck? And he said, yeah, I knew it was going to suck. But at the same time, you know, I watched it on TV and I thought to myself, okay, yeah, that's going to suck. He said. So I, I thought I understood how it was going to suck, but I didn't understand how it was gonna sound. And there was there, I said, this really sucks and he quit. And again, a good dude, that debt. I'm kind of, you know, thinking myself, why? I'm trying to figure out why people quit. Yeah. And that was what he said.

Speaker 1:          01:39:50       He said much like we're saying like as much as you could imagine and you say to yourself, all man, never. Yeah, but I think I can cook. I could make that one more step. You don't know. You don't know until you've been dehydrated. Having people trying to shoot you, cleaning up your buddies, brains off your jacket for weeks, months on end, you're dehydrated and now you have no shoes, no stockings. And your march or doing a forced march on this road for this may march for days without stopping. What even is that Tang? Yeah. Yeah. That's it. I mean, this kind of, that's not to mention like no medical care. No. Like no one's coming to save you. You know, it's really jacked up is thinking about this. Think if you have an ingrown toenail. Right, right. Like a little thing that is Bob, it actually bothers you in actual life.

Speaker 1:          01:40:49       Yeah. Thank. If you had that here or you have a, or you have, say you got a sprained ankle. Yeah, a bad sprained ankle. I sprained my ankle really bad before. Sure. You can't walk on it. Well now you don't have a choice. You either walk on it or you die. I think about the little things that are, that caused you an inconvenience right now and think about what an inconvenience that is in this situation. Think about you get a little infection in your fingers, your fingers year. You ever had one of those little stupid like where your fingernail is, get a little infection there. Think about that and that you don't have no medicine. You don't have any way of, yeah, that's the things you're going to turn into in giant infection. You Die. It's the little, little tiny things that annoy you are will kill you back in the day check. So what we have to do is prepare for these hard times. Do you have any advice on how we could help prepare ourselves for these hard times on top of references,

Speaker 4:          01:41:49       seeing these scenarios? I referenced your guys' scenario. Like basically everything that you guys guys tell me and talk about like how it's super hot, you don't sleep as much. I'm not talking about them talking about like Ian Ramadi, like all these stuff. I kind of imagine that helps. Totally helps. That's good because it, it helps me to think about rifleman Harris. Yeah, for sure. You too. Speaking to help. Speaking of help, help being yourself. All right, so you're just in the way, this is kind of a dichotomy here cause you know like when your joints get sore, I'm talking about Krill oil. Joining her for a real quick

Speaker 1:          01:42:29       that you can be spelled in dream luxury. Yeah. You recommend Harris who would've had Kerlan Jobe warfare. Who knows? Maybe it wouldn't have stopped that day. That time. This is pre luxury.

Speaker 4:          01:42:41       Yeah. Supreme luxury where now it's like, hey my joints, I'm getting older. My joints kind of hurt. I kept, I can't work out at the gym, you know, at my leisure as good. Let me take some joint warfare, you know, improve my comfort while I work out. Function for sure function. But Comfort has has a lot to do with it. Working out with sore joints is way less comfortable than not sore joints.

Speaker 1:          01:43:07       Yeah. I'm going to say though, there's exercises that you cannot do when you, when your joints aren't ready to rock and roll. Yeah. So you can push yourself harder and be better prepared for the hard times if you're working correctly, if your joints are working correctly. Yeah. That's the dichotomy. And there also is no

Speaker 4:          01:43:27       like concession. There's no, there's no reason to say, hey, my joints being less healthy is a good, is fine, is good. That's a good thing. You know. So you have a choice. Shouldn't, should I maintain or improve this joint, my joint health, the health of my body including, but not limited to joints or should I not? The decision should never be, I'm not, never be, I think this was my opinion anyway. So the point is, so jock, Lizzie them supplements joint. So it's for your joints to me, best kind of supplements as, as someone who with a level head. Now as far as supplements goes. So I think the joint for your joints, um, you know, bones, maybe stuff that's going to base structure, structural, structural support. Because again, and I said, I said this before, like if you're like going for super cool protein powder, a lot of people that say, Hey, what's a good protein daughter?

Speaker 4:          01:44:31       Here's the thing you don't stake. Like how much protein do you like not get to need supplemental protein. You know, people want that cause it could even convenience. That's why people like those very, very few. I'm going to make one that's going to be both convenient and tasty and good. Alright, there you go nonetheless. That's cool. I'm not saying that's a bad thing. I'm saying as far as like the importance of focusing on a supplement, the most benefit. Okay, so your sound lamenting your convenience then really for sure not supplementing protein, you're supplementing convenience. Nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with that. We've got a lot to do. I understand. But as far as like the, what do you call it, the hierarchy of suppler Jordan B. Peterson supplements or the house. It's hierarchy of supplements, like the Krill oil, Omega threes, like these kinds of things that help you directly. That's the, that's the main ones. Anyway, so your point in all this is Josh also supplements, legit supplements, Super Krill oil. Jocko super is what's called Krill oil, free joints and joint warfare.

Speaker 4:          01:45:47       Where do you get them? Or Gin main dotcom kit. Thank you, Bro. I'm telling you it. I feel like you're drawing this out way too much. Just if I was doing this and be like, hey, if you want to have good, healthy joints, get some krill oil, Krill and get some joint warfare from origin main.com m. A. I. N. E. Yeah, but and then we'd be good. We'd been moving on the next thing. Yeah, no, I dig it and I got the hierarchy. Here's the thing though. Dominance. No, this makes sense. This is relevant because you're not doing it on a proof point because it needs to be proven. No, because back out of your element again, again, when I was, we'll say 23 and I'm going to take some phosphorous something. Yeah, so what if someone listening or group people listening who have that same mindset because not because I knew both things, I would just just didn't know.

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       Okay, so I'm going to say no. We know. Yeah. Well that's good. If there's someone that doesn't know that, maybe they turned this off like eight minutes ago, maybe, maybe not, or maybe they're more educated now and maybe boom there. Now they're looking into the joint situation. That's what I think is happening. That's my opinion. Hey, that's my prediction. I'm sure Twitter will let us know any way. The origin main.com on the top click labs. Actually three in the front page. I keep forgetting this phrase on the front page. Boom. Supergirl, Supergirl and joint warfare kid on it. There's also some Geezer in rash guards. People been asking me years now what? Gee, should I get? I started. You did to with gee, should I get, we know now we know.

Speaker 4:          01:47:42       Yeah. That's an exciting thing. I'm just saying if you're into that kind of thing, but nonetheless, you know, Pete makes it in Maine, formulates the fabric. Boom. Geese. Other stuff too. By the way. Clothing, he has more of like a stylish kind of twist on his clothing. Yeah. In fact I was, who was it? Oh Dave Burke. Yeah, we're in Utah.

And some, you know how like certain things just apply to you more like if your, your advice on, I dunno, college, that's easy. One to remember about how to approach college, right. Crush college or whatever. It's gonna apply to me more if I'm actually in college, you know, versus just apply that to other things in life would you can easily do for sure, but that's going to apply to me directly. We'll say, oh, you know more than maybe the next guy.

Speaker 4:          01:53:38       So that kind of stuff where that one I want to remember. Okay, I'm going to come back to that one. If I can constantly remind myself of the things that directly apply to me, you can be more, it's going to be more beneficial rather than just linking to all the podcasts and hoping you remember each one. Nonetheless, point there is that it. That's a good reason to subscribe to the Youtube Channel. So if you, in fact, if the excerpts or some excerpts resonate with you, you got them there at your fingertips and you can share. Also, Jack was a store it called Jocko store Jocko store.com that's the URL there there. That's where you can get if you want shirts because you don't even know what you are Alizea anymore. Of course they do. You think so? I think that's common language. No, actually no, I think you're right.

Speaker 4:          01:54:28       Just call it the website. Website. Yeah. The website website, URL stand for to see, well I don't even know. Here's the thing I knew that I forgot. No, I'm actually not a tech guy. Yeah, but you knew it. I knew what it meant. I don't know what it stands for. I Dunno. Universal home. Ask your brother. I know where it's probably not even universal. J Charles. Nonetheless it's Jocko. The website is Jocko store.com. I'm not that creative but easy to remember and that's where he can get the shirts. Hoodies, rash guards, compression rash guards if you will. We're very selective cities where you maintain range of motion. Jujitsu specifically in my opinion, uh, what he's on their hoodies, all the hoodies. They're the same design but the, there are the heavy ones. People have been asking me like, are these the heavy ones are, where's the heavy hoodies ones we saw like the, the non heavy ones, we'll call them.

Speaker 4:          01:55:29       I've got therapy. The first kind of iteration. Exactly. Well, those were all sold out. They sold out last year. And so I did another iteration with your for the heaviest there. They're the heaviest one. Actually I think there might be some industrial heavier one. Maybe. No, because I think that was then he, I dunno, I forget. Nonetheless. These are the heavy ones. Confirm, double confirm. I'm also so women's stuff on there. Uh, I think I'm going to add a few things before Christmas on the store. So if you want, keep your eyes on that. That's a good way to support. If you want something, get something, check them out. Also, psychological warfare. If you didn't know what that is until it's an album with tracks, Jocko talking on these tracks, basically you listen to them when you are, you know, on the path we'll say on the path and you get moments of weakness, days of weakness, you know, those, you're not feeling like it.

Speaker 4:          01:56:39       You know how you always talk about like, it doesn't matter if you feel like you're not, you just do it. Okay, let's do it. Okay. So, uh, and I respect that and that's where we all want to want to be. We all want to be there, but for some of us it's not like that 100% of the time. Sometimes when you really don't feel like it. Sometimes when I really don't feel like it, I just don't do it, man. Sometimes I gotta be honest. We'll put on psychological warfare and you'll do it. Yes, like a spot, you know, especially a spa. This is where it's like a no brainer. Like really easy. When you, you're like contemplating when you're like, he's, I could just do this tomorrow. Right. And you start making deals with yourself. Do you ever do that? Deals with myself. The weak part of it.

Speaker 4:          01:57:26       It's like you don't so straight up Jocko Jocko like I don't feel like it, I feel like it, whatever gain, I get pissed at myself at yourself. If I start leaning towards like, oh, maybe I just won't do anything. No. Oh really? Really how it is. That's how, okay, cool. We're going to go smash. You know? It's real funny. That doesn't surprise. I've witnessed that with you. Like we'll be like, ah, I don't know if we can kind of do that. Then you get this sort of look this kind of way about you kind of like, wait, did I just say that echoes going on vacation and he's going to be gone for a couple of weeks and I've been real busy with all kinds of stuff. And we were talking about if we'd be able to actually get all these podcasts done and I didn't think we could do it.

Speaker 4:          01:58:20       And so I said, hey, echo, you know, we're just gonna have to take, you know, no, no podcast for a few weeks. And then, um, then I said, actually, I, like a day went by and I said, I said, echo a text that said, uh, actually we're going to do it in your corn, all the podcasts. I'm going to prep for them all. We're going to have an all nighter and we'll just get it done. Bring some red bull and get some great some Jocko white tea. Yeah. Well what was interesting about that is when you said that you had this kind of tone of like Dang, like term it like, Whoa, we got to take a break. We've got to take a break after two years by the way, every single week, by the way, we got to take a break. That's what you said. Yeah. And right when you, and I was like, cool.

Speaker 4:          01:59:05       I dig it. I mean I'm not saying good, I'm saying cool. I I totally understand. And you know what? That makes sense. Hbo Big Company takes huge breaks. Everybody takes huge breaks. Everybody takes parent and you're over here two years in, no breaks, no breaks, no matter what. Okay. So they'll come a time when we are forced to for some reason. Yeah. That's kind of part of the point bro. So I'm like, cool, I dig it. I totally understand Jocko. And when I said that, that's when your face kind of shifted, like kind of you went into your own world. Did I just say that? Like, it's almost like you sorta got mad. Real subtle, but it was there and I was like, oh, we're not taking a break. I know docker is going to come back nonetheless. And I'm sure that I'm like, okay, so I dig it.

Speaker 4:          01:59:55       But back to psychological warfare. If you need a spot or even want a spot with those times that you're like, maybe I'll skip the workout, maybe I'll slip in the dive minute. Just listen to any track. And the track is labeled, you know, where if you can skip on the diet, it's like just sugarcoated. Like wait, what is it? Sure. But it's something, something's sugarcoated, lies. Sure. Recording. It's just so, yeah. So he listened to that. And then what's good is it's not some inspirational, Eh, you can do it. It's not that. It's like it's pragmatic here to do that. Here's the thing though, you, but just by nature, your tone of voice kind of, kind of like by happenstance inserts that concept in it. So it's kind of a double double thing as it turns out. But primarily it's just, it's a pragmatic thing. Think about, think about this logical stuff.

Speaker 4:          02:00:51       And then at the end of the truck he kind of conclude that, oh yeah, it's going to get after it. Yeah, exactly right. That's what psychological warfare is. It is on iTunes, Amazon music, Google play, wherever you can get MP, three s mp3s, true story. Anyway, to support. Also, you get Jocko white tea and if you're having trouble dead lifting less than a thousand pounds, if you get Jocko white tea, that would be solved immediately and your, your dead lift will then be 8,000 pounds, including uh, Jordan B. Peterson who can now dead lift a thousand pounds. He broke through his 7,000 pounds. Yup. Cat barrier barrier books. I got some books way the warrior kid number one. Um, don't let your kid be a wimpy kid. Why would you do that? Or why would you let your neighbors could be a wimpy kid? Why would you do that? Get them on the path way the warrior kid

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       path stronger, faster, smarter, better. It gets some extreme ownership. The new edition is out and thanks to you all because we added questions. Your questions from this podcast into an appendix inside. Not every question, but uh, a bunch of them. Oh, good amount. So they're in there. There's also a new Ford and some new color pictures. Color pictures. Interesting. Yeah. Cause I don't like color pictures. I said no dichotomy. They said, well this is more premium. I said, no, black and white is between users. So anyways, if you want to see what I looked like in color then you can get the book. But the w two to offset that, I said okay fine. You want to put color pictures in there, make the whole book black. So that's what they did. Make the whole book black and that was that end. Speaking of black also.

Speaker 2:          02:02:35       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:02:35       the discipline equals freedom field manual is available worldwide. And I told you about that tagline that the publisher wanted to have like the um, this book is a superb differ for the holiday season. And I told them no, the tag line is, there's no better gift than disappointed.

Speaker 2:          02:02:57       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:02:57       That's the truth. You know, it's actually true. If you could give someone the gift of discipline, would you not be giving them the best gift in life? Yes. Now you can actually give them the gift of discipline equals freedom field manual so you can do that. Now this is important because people keep asking me the field manual audio version, discipline equals freedom field manual is it is also on iTunes, Amazon music, Google play, other MP3 platforms. It's available right now. It is not on audible. Audible is not with tracks. No, we wanted an album with tracks. It's why we did it this way for something on top of the books and the podcast.
