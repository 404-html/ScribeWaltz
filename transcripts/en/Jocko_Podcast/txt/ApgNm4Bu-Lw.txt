Speaker 1:          00:00          Jocko. I have a question for you. I know you're very busy guy. How do you find time to read so many books? I have. I have many that I want to read, but I've trouble having enough time. Any advice on how to set aside time to do so? Uh, sure. All right. Lay It on me. Make time. What are you, what are you doing all day the taken? What are you doing all day? Are you watching TV? Are you surfing the Internet? Are you watching youtube videos? That's my question. What are you doing before you go to sleep at night? Are you looking at Twitter? Are you looking at Instagram posts? The Instagram videos. Tell me they're not the like an addiction. Yeah, you get the, you get the Instagram video. Every one of them is funny. They're 38 seconds long. The one minute long.

Speaker 1:          01:01          Get to see people hurt themselves. Get to see people do dumb things and make you feel good about yourself. I didn't do that dumb thing and someone else did. I can laugh at them. How long are you going to look at those videos for? When you could be reading. So, so there you go. Stop wasting a bunch of time. And then what about audio books? What are you doing when you're mowing the lawn? What are you doing when you're trimming the hedges? What are you doing when you're pulling weeds? What are you doing when you're cleaning the dishes? Get some audio books. Get some audio books. What are you doing first thing in the morning?

Speaker 1:          01:38          What are you doing? Are you waking up, checking your email, sitting around waiting, you know, wasting a bunch of time. Are you getting up early enough that you could just get up, get out of bed, go and read for 30 minutes, 30 minutes? That's what you have to do. You have to make time. There's plenty of time to read. There's plenty of time to read. You probably don't want to read as badly as your, as you think. If you wanted to read that bad, you'd make time. You make time to breathe somehow. You can make time to breathe. You can make time to read. Yeah, I wouldn't say it's the best. Yeah, he would be a better one because like, yeah, eat I think because read, you can read while you're doing other things sometimes, especially with just, just kind of like as a, as a, uh, so I'm reading, I'm always have to be reading a book to read a book for the broadcast, right?

Speaker 1:          02:37          Yeah. I had only read the first maybe 10 books that we read that we did on the podcast. We've done a hundred or something now. Probably more than that. I'd only read like 10 of them and maybe it, maybe a few more, but I'd read them so long ago. Maybe I'd read 30, but some of them so long ago that just, I had to reread them. And so then you say to yourself, okay, so when would you know when I read all the time or we'd go to bed greeting, wake up reading, um, uh, going in an airplane, see people, what do people do in an airplane? You Watch a movie, I know you sleep, they do all this stuff. I sleep sometimes in an airplane, but we're from not sleeping, get us. Guess what I'm doing? Reading, prepping for a podcast and I can attest to, yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:19          Uh, what do you think is the, like the biggest ones that people

Speaker 1:          03:23          are, um, you know, that, you know, the, the biggest activities they could, yeah. They could just stop and it just, uh, for me, I think the biggest time sucks. Our Youtube. I think Instagram. Yeah. I think those two are really, um, what's the word? Stimulating to the brain. And you actually get this weird like, well, I actually like, I'm going to learn a little something from this right here. I'm gonna take something away from this. I'm going to veg out. I'm going to escape from my world right now. It's like escapism, right? Yeah. And, and they look, they actually have algorithms that are stat, know what you will click on. They actually know that about you. They mapped your little brain and know that if they put up a video that has, if they put up a thumbnail of a video and it's got a heavy machine gun in it, they, they know they got a good chance. I'm going to click on it. Right. And then they give it a catchphrase title, right? Nope. They give it a catchphrase. Title. Isis gets massacre. I gotta watch that. Yup. I'll click 50 cal vs Taliban. Oh, cool. Click right? Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. And actually know words you're going to click on. And that's, that's so, and what do you get out of it? You Watch it for 20 minutes. Short game. Yeah. You get nothing out of it. You get a book, you read, you learn, you'll write something. That's what you do.

Speaker 2:          05:07          Yeah. That, and actually the youtube thing is, it's funny if that's one of your things, it's worse than, it's not just youtube who's trying to get you to watch the video. It's the video makers themselves. So you do has the Algorithm, oh, they got it all kind of sorted out there. And now the video makers, they make titles like 50 cal versus Xyz and the awful punching those too. And guess what? 50 cal versus you can fill in the blank. You're probably going to watch that video. It doesn't have that motivation speech ever. Yes. Oh yeah. So, so in, so destroys whatever destroys reporter in interview. Exactly right. So once you really own,

Speaker 2:          05:49          cause those are the actual things are actual, so basically doubled, right? When you log on to youtube, once Youtube pops up on your screen, Bro, everyone on that screen is all sucking your attention. Literally. That's their job. Sucking your attention. So yeah man, that's a big one, right? Instagram. So here's the, here's the, here's the one that it really hit me really hard that Graham and I like Instagram. It's like good. But if you're like trying to read, you know, if you want to read more or whatever, consider like even like let's say we start recording just for a second, we're going to look on the bus, on our phones. We're gonna maybe checking email and maybe we got a text or whatever. And the Cha, the probability of Instagram coming up on there, we're going to open it. But the probability of US opening Instagram is, it's pretty significant.

Speaker 2:          06:33          It's pretty high. And you can scroll through there, whatever. Even if you school for two, three minutes, right? You scrolled through there. Maybe you what? You looked at a, I don't know, 1520 people's posts. Read what they had to say. If you have a, what do you, what do you call like kindle or something, but you do that same thing. It's like can the end, like you're saying you can read. Yeah. Read instead. So if you had a camera, like once you said like imagine you're giddy being videotaped. Like what if you're being videotaped all day and all he did was calculate every time you opened up Instagram or Facebook or Twitter and or youtube, all those Ptr, every time you open up at, and he had that scenario in one average day. Then you take all that time and replace it with, you, opened your kindle to read more, busts out a book.

Speaker 2:          07:16          You know, you've bringing books or whatever we do. And that's how to, instead of doing that, you did the book, Brian, you know how much reading you do, right? You'd read so much. Yeah. So it's like the, yeah, those are the time sucks man. Your phone, it's so available, you know? But probably you can read on your phone too. That's a big one. TV Too. He Watch TV. Not really. I watch one show now. It actually to Hawaii, five o and that's it. Sometimes Shark tank. That's it man. 100%. It's weird. What does it, how often does the Hawaii five o on once a week and it goes in seasons. So you got, how long has this season? I Dunno. 13 episodes I guess. I Dunno, I have no, no, no, but on the last, I have watched one TV show recently. It's called billions. Oh Wow.

Speaker 1:          08:04          Little scenario unfolding on billions. All right, well you can actually actually, there you go. Yeah. And keep in mind, it's not like I've never seen any other show ever. It never will. It's not that they're just saying, you know how people they like made watch Tino routinely and actually, um, I will separate the fact that nowadays you can watch TV in a different way. Right? It's not like at eight o'clock on a Thursday night. You've got to sit there and watch it. 30 minutes show with the 30 minutes worth of commercials in it.

Speaker 2:          08:33          Yeah. Right. No, you can. You're, you're

Speaker 1:          08:38          on a flight somewhere. You've read, you've got to take it easy on your eyes a little bit. If you start reading too much, you've read for a long time. Okay. You're going to stare out the window for a little while, listen to this part of a podcast or something. Then you're like, okay, my brain is like barely functioning. Okay. I'm going to watch an episode of billions.

Speaker 2:          08:53          Yeah. On you ever seen ballers? I Dunno, the different, well, I do know the difference. I watched that for a little bit, but you know like people have a routine like tonight, you know, every night for 30 minutes they watched TV with their kids or whatever. It's like that doesn't really happen anymore. Yeah. Next question. Really Sad. How much time you can waste these days with the distractions that are people trying to get that time from you. Yeah. Your discipline. Like when you, when you first started saying disciplining quick. Oh, when I first started hearing it from you, that was like one of the things that popped into my head. Like as being really obvious, like if you are disciplined with your time, you'll have a lot of free time. Like a lot, a lot of free time, way more than you would think anyway. Because you know, even when I'm like real busy, you know, if I can accurately remember my day, I can remember like just like five minutes here, 15 minutes there like that. I did something that was a waste of time. And if you add up all those little minutes you have probably hours proffer, showers for to do, do something for progressive, you know, productive, progressive, progress, your life, valuable, valuable, all those things in check.
