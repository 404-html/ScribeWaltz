Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number one 10 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. All sciences have principles and rules. War has none. The great captains who have written of it give us none. Extreme cleverness is required to even understand them and it is impossible to base any judgment on their relations of the historian historians for they only speak of war as their imaginations painted. As for the great captains who have written of it, they've attempted rather to be interesting than instructive. Since the mechanics of war is dry and tedious, books dealing with it have small success and their merit will not be recognized except after the passage of time. Those writing historically of war have better luck. They are sought by all the curious and kept in the all libraries. That is why we only have a confused idea of the discipline of the Greeks and Romans wore is a science covered with shadows in who's obscurity. One cannot move within assured step routine and prejudice. The natural result of ignorance or its foundation and support. Nothing is so disgraceful as lavishness to custom. This is both a result of ignorance and a proof of it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:42       Chevalier, full lard supposes all men to be brave at all times and does not realize that the courage of the troops must be reborn daily, that nothing is so variable. And that the true skill of a general consists of knowing how to guarantee it by his dispositions, his positions, and those traits of genius that characterized great captains. Perhaps he reserved of this immense disc, perhaps he reserved discussion of this immense subject and perhaps also escaped him. Nevertheless, it is of all the elements of war, the one that is most necessary to study the same troops who if attacking would have been victorious, may be inevitable, invariably defeated in entrenchments. Few men have accounted for it in a reasonable manner for it lies in human hearts and one should search for it. There no one has written of this matter, which is of the most importance, the most learned, and the most profound of the profession of war. And without a knowledge of the human heart, one is dependent upon the favor of which sometimes is very inconstant.

Speaker 1:          00:03:06       So those are some opening words from a book called reveries on war by Marise de sacs. This guy's a character Marista sacks. You do a little research on them. Did you find out how much of a character he was? He was a serious character. There's a couple of things. There's a couple of things. Even in that opening right there that I wasn't sure if I was going to cover this and I was kind of like going back to it to see if it was something we should cover. But I just, when you get right here, all sciences have principles and rules. War has none. That's a true statement. And it's true that there's, you know, there's principles of warfare, but there's no actual rules. Like you can do whatever you want. I mean you can say the Geneva Convention, but then you can just defy it and just, you know, you can do things that are completely opposed to it.

Speaker 1:          00:03:55       So there's no rules. You should do whatever you want to win. Now you could lose your respect and you could act in humane and that might cost you in the long run. But if wars war, there's no other thing like that. Right. There's no other thing like that. Do whatever you want. I guess if you had a, if you had like a street fight with no weapons and someone going to do whatever they could to win. Right. That's the thing. It's, that's war. It's the same thing. Yeah. I'm sure. Yeah. When you deal with like death is kind of the goal and the consequences at the same time, like death. That's the end of the line. So yeah. Anything goes essentially. Yeah. Yeah. Nothing else is like that. Then he says this, nothing is so disgraceful as slavish to custom. That's a bold statement to, I agree.

Speaker 1:          00:04:44       Disgraceful. He calls it, he talks about these prejudices that people have, I think you call them, what do you call them, by biases, right? Cognitive biases. He talks about, he doesn't talk about that, but he talks about them, but this guy was a character. He lived from 1696 to 1750 he started off as a German soldier in the army of the holy Roman Empire, which was like this bunch of territories in Europe that were banded together under that name. And they were around for a long time, from like the Middle Ages until the time of the Napoleonic wars. So the early 18 hundreds and he served also served in the imperial army, which was another kind of army that often fought alongside the army of the whole holy Roman Empire. And if buddy, but the weird thing is is he finished his career as the Marshall General of France. And so he had kind of, I guess you could say kind of switched sides, but he Rose Rose up through the ranks because his military career started at the age of 13 when he fought at the battle of Mal per k.

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       I think that's how you say it, which, and that, that, that war, that battle right there was, that was between the army of the holy Roman Empire and France. So he was on both sides at certain points of his life. And I think the whole time he was, it seems like from what I read about him, he was always kind of looking to go up the social structure, you know, rate rise up in the social structure and become more powerful person in the hierarchy of those times in the dominance hierarchy. So yeah, he started fighting at age 13 which by the way, that's just so cool. I don't, I'm sorry if you think I'm a bad person, but as far as I'm concerned, if I could have joined the military at 13 I would have been so stoked. Uh, sorry, everyone that's, that doesn't agree with that.

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       That's just how I roll. I'm just telling the truth on that one. And actually as I look back on my life, if I could've done that would've been even better. I think they should allow people to join the military. They should have some like a Youth Corp. Yeah, you can go in and just get after it at a young age, but they think they think a 13 year old can't make that decision and the right, the 13 year old can't make that decision. So you'd have to have really benevolent people that were in charge of them in charge of these troops. And you also think that an 18 year old person can make a good decision. But if that's not true either, cause you've got 18 people that are dumber than dirt and make bad decisions and people are worried that you're going to get thoughts put into your head.

Speaker 1:          00:07:24       Yeah, you are. You are. I guess what if they're good thoughts, right on. That's not a bad thing, right? Yeah. I mean do you have to learn everything yourself? Is that the way the world works? You can't have good ideas put into your head. You can't get a little bit programmed. You could get programmed to be a better human being. Would you accept that programming? Yeah, of course. But Hey, I'm just checking you're over there looking like I'm a bad person because I'm trying to brainwash, you know, cause you're just saying the word better. Good and better. Like there's this universal good and better. You know, there is no, there isn't. I mean there is, okay, we have Jordan B. Peterson on here. You can converse that where you could, you could have a conversation with him about that. How do you say that? You don't know that there's universal good and use universal banks?

Speaker 1:          00:08:05       No, no, no. I'm saying, I mean, we could give dozens of things right now that we know are good. I don't know if the child, is that good or bad for you, see where I'm going to take something that doesn't belong to you, good or bad. But those, there's still basic and fundamental that you don't, you don't need a youth corp to, well, there's a lot of people out there that don't get taught that stuff. And that's true too. But that's a whole different issue. Okay. Well I'm just making sure. Yeah. But if you're, yeah, I know. Well, you're saying how you're saying like good ideas and good ideas. You're talking about your way specifically, which I think, no, no, no, I was not. I would not. And I still even, you know, I get in trouble for this because for instance, if people say, oh, you shouldn't wake up at four 30 in the morning. And, and I always say like, yeah, I know. I'm not saying you have to wake up at four 30 in the morning. I'm saying to wake up earlier. Don't be lazy. Yeah. Right. I'm not saying you have to, I say, you know, don't eat donuts. Right? Sure. I'm not saying you can never

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       taste anything that tastes good. I'm just saying it'd be smart, man. Come on. You don't need a donut and donuts are actually on the eval. They might just be pure evil too, by the way. Right. Come on, man. Don't assume Sony, they don't even make you feel, I mean, is there any, do you get any satisfaction from a donut status? Well, it depends on what you mean by satisfaction and you always want to try and parse these things. Well, you can't tell him absolutely. Okay. Of 10 seconds. Good taste in your mouth. Sugar Rush, get SOM and technically pay for that. Health and fitness. You don't seem to care. No. W who me? Oh yeah. Nah Man, I care. I care a lot. Okay. I'm just making sure I'm trying to, I'm trying to look at it from all angles, satisfaction technically and by lucky. But you could come up with some fundamental good things and I'll tell you this, the military does teach some fundamental good things.

Speaker 2:          00:09:41       So if I could have joined at the age of 13 it would have been good for me. I would have been stoked. Actually. I would have missed out on some cool stuff too. Cause I had some fun back in the jury and I did the stuff that actually led to me being who I am today. You know, I learned some stuff but not what I'm saying. The point is, is that your way, not everyone will agree. I agree with you. Okay. And I'm sure a bunch of people do, but I'm just saying there's like different, no, I guess I'm not pro universal brainwashing to mind methods of I'm not, I'm not, which makes 13 year old by the way, which a 13 year old now. I'll tell you, I just said that, that going in the military, I would have missed out on some things, you know, maybe some growing up experiences.

Speaker 2:          00:10:20       Uh, Marista sac didn't miss out on a, on a damn thing cause he was getting after it in many different ways, not only on the battlefield but also as a, a little bit of a maniac. He was, he, first of all, he was like apparently a physically, he was kind of a beast of a man and like physically and he fought, he, he kind of proved himself. He distinguished themselves in some big battles as he was 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 years old. Apparently he could bend a horse shoe with his hand. And, and I, I was looking at that, I was thinking myself. He, they mean hands, right? They must be enhanced. It didn't say that it's at hand and I didn't want to take anything away from him. So apparently he could grab, uh, he was big and can grab a horseshoe and just bend it in one hand.

Speaker 2:          00:11:07       So he had some some serious strength and through his life he commanded companies, which he actually refers to as centuries, which if you can imagine century, we know that means a hundred so a century like the ancient Roman army had centuries instead of companies and they weren't even a hundred people. There were like 80 people, but he led those, he led regiments and he led whole armies and he fought with a lot of success throughout his career. Now with that, that being said, he was far from what anyone would actually consider a role model because he, the way he lived his personal life was not exactly exempt rurally. Exempt, Burley. I didn't say that word right.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       Exam. Blurry. Yes, simpler down. In fact, all the way he lived his life was probably the opposite of role model. So he was forced into marriage at the age of 18 he didn't want to get married because he's, I think he was too much of a womanizer and said, I don't want to get married, but he married this heiress 14 year old Eris with a ton of money. He blew all her money and he was 18 she was 18 she was 14 she was, she was an error with a bunch of money. He took all our money and blew it on horses for his regiment and on women, Mr Cysts. And then he had a bunch of public affairs and everyone kind of knew about it. And the marriage got an old and he continued this kind of want and behavior, I think throughout his life.

Speaker 1:          00:12:39       And a couple times he's hypocritical because in the book he talks about certain types of people. And I don't know if I cover it, but he does come across a little bit hypocritical Buffalo, hypocritical sometimes. Now I think one of this is this one quote I grabbed from this mistress, this kind of famous mistress actually, she's recognized as the chief mistress of King Louis the 15th so did you know that the king had like not just mistresses, we know that, but there's a chief mistress whose known, her name was Madame de Pompadour and this is what she said about Saks. Marista Sachs does not understand anything about the delicacy of love. The only pleasure he takes in the society of women can be summed up in one word, debauchery.

Speaker 3:          00:13:27       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:13:28       so he's a little bit out of control. He might have in fact inherited his,

Speaker 3:          00:13:35       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:13:36       Lifestyle choices or from his dad whose name was Frederick Augustus, who was well known for his personal, unbridled lust. Sure. How do you know that he had on bridal lust? Well, case in point, Maurice was the eldest son reached to Sachs, was the eldest of 354 acknowledged illegitimate children that Frederick fathered. So while we might not want to emulate Marista sacks his personal life, he was an experienced and successful leader of men on the battlefield. And we can learn from him. And with that, let's go back to the book and here's Marista Sachs, a man who has a talent for architecture and Ken design. We'll draw the plan and perspective of a palace with great skill, but if he is to execute it, if he does not know how to shape his stones to lay his foundation, the whole edifice will crash soon. It's the same with the general who does not know the principles of his art, nor how to organize his troops for these are indispensable qualifications in all the operations of war.

Speaker 1:          00:14:57       The prodigious success with which the Romans always gained with small armies against multitudes of barbarians can be attributed to nothing but the excellent composition of their troops. Not that I would infer from this that a man of genius will not be able to succeed even at the head of an army of tartars. It is much, this is the, this is the interesting part. It is much easier to take men as they are then to make them as they should be. It is difficult to reconcile opinions, prejudice, prejudices, and passions. So there's a couple of interesting things. I also forgot to point out that he wrote this kind of on a whim and he actually starts off this, this whole book kind of, he says this work was not born from a desire to establish a new method of the art award. It was composed to amuse and instruct myself.

Speaker 1:          00:15:55       And then one of the last things he says in the book is to the readers, I wrote this book in 13 nights. I was sick. Thus it very probably shows the fever I had. This should supply my excuses for the irregularity of the arrangement as well as the inelegance of the style I wrote militarily to anticipate my boredom. Now on top of those, that excuse right on top of that, he was a big opium user. So we're figuring he was probably right in this and an impaired state. Sure. We're dealing with it. We're not, we're not mad about it, but we're realistic. And the reason I say this is because some of the writing is a little bit tricky and some run on sentences and yeah, so we have to, we have to pull a little bit harder to get some nuggets, but there's plenty of nuggets and I think that's one of them is much easier to take men as they are then to make them as they should be.

Speaker 1:          00:16:51       And where I look at that as a leader, you get people that are good at something and you get someone that's not good at something, but they're going to something else. You put people where you can use them. You put people where their skills are most available and where they can, where they can perform their duties to the highest level because they're naturally good at it. That's all it's saying. I'm not having you proof read my writing at night, right? Yeah. No, no, no, I'm not, and I'm not over here trying to make videos. No, I'm not. Right. You see where I'm going with us. So it would it, it'd be easier if you said, you know what, Jocko, when it comes to the podcast, why don't you come up with a talking a bunch of talking and I'll make cool videos. Right. We kinda did that.

Speaker 1:          00:17:39       Otherwise we, people would be listening to you talking about movies from 1988 and comparing them to stuff very, very clunky, which is, you know, it's fine. Yeah, but, and then wouldn't you have to expend more resources and your part to to coach me up. Yes. So imagine that and, and I'd be trying to make videos, which I can, and I'd have to coach you make me mad. We don't want that. No, it would make me mad because it's dealing with computers and stuff. I don't mind computers, but I don't like them. Sure. No. So yeah. Yeah. But that's a, that's a big part of like why he's saying it though, right? Because it's like, it's like you're going to save yourself a lot of time and headache. Exactly. But when you're trying to coach these guys up and when you, when you get to the seal teams, it's like, oh, you're a small, a small guy.

Speaker 1:          00:18:26       Cool. You're going to be appointment. Yeah. Yeah. You're a big guy. Cool. You're going to carry it at a and m 60 or now to mark 48 that's what, that's how it's happening. We're not going to take the small guy and try and get him up him taller and bigger and stronger and we're not going to take the big guy and starving and send them into ranger school. So he loses 38 pounds and he comes back and like, okay, your appointment now. No, let's, let's use nature. And he's, he talks about that in other places. All right, he's talking about in this section how to uh, how to raise an army basically. How do you make an army? And I thought this one was a little bit interesting because people ask me this question all the time. He's talking about mandatory service and this is his opinion on it.

Speaker 1:          00:19:12       Would it not be better to prescribe by law that every man, whatever his condition in life should be obliged to serve his prints in his country for five years? It doesn't, that's no joke. Sometimes people say two years and that seems reasonable and a lot of countries do that. He says five years, and it's kind of funny, his attitude towards five years back to the book, this law could not be objected to because it is natural and just that all citizens should occupy themselves with the defense of the nation. Concur. No inconvenience could result if they were chosen between the ages of 20 and 30 years. These are all the years of Libertine Ej. When youth seeks its fortune, travels the country, and is of little comfort to parents. This would not be a public calamity because one could be sure that when five years had passed, discharge would be granted.

Speaker 1:          00:20:02       So he's saying like, people couldn't be mad about it cause it's only five years. And he's also saying, look, this is when your kids are out of control anyways. You might as well have them in the military. There's that, that whole idea of the libertine that took place back in the day and these guys were, you know, basically wild morally getting after it or I should. They were, they were. They were. They were partying, wicked heart. I'm trying to think of a good way to say it. They were pardoned. Wicked hard with drugs, booze and women. Yeah, the libertines and they, that was, they called them a rake. Like if a guy, a guy that was out there with a bunch of different women all the time, it'd be called the rakers, a bunch of period novels that I had to read, read when I was in college.

Speaker 1:          00:20:44       That's why I know about it, about these libertine rakes. So he continues on. This method of raising troops would provide an inexhaustible reservoir of fine recruits who would not be subject to desertion in course of time. As a consequence, it would be regarded as an honor to have fulfilled one service. I'd say that's probably accurate, but to produce this effect is essential. To make no distinctions, to be immovable on this point and to enforce the law, particularly on the nobles and the rich, then no one will complain, hey, you gotta if you're gonna do it to one person, you got to do it to everyone equally. Consequently, those who had not served their time will scorn those who are reluctant to obey the law and insensibly. It will become an honor to serve the poor bourgeois who will be consoled by the example of the rich and the wrench will not dare complain upon seeing the noble serve arms is an honorable profession.

Speaker 1:          00:21:44       How many princes have borne arms? Now what's interesting about this idea is that there's some people in the world that aren't really meant for warfare. And so should we let nature, I I more, I'm more heavily agree with the previous point. You should let people do what they're good at naturally. So you're going to end up recruiting people that might not be good at this naturally. And that's not a good thing. But not everyone was aware, right? No, you're right. You can put them into different jobs. Yeah, that's, that's absolutely true. They could put the, the guy that's more, uh, more apt to be like good at writing. He could become a military journalist or something like that. Yeah, you're right. You know, people always ask me that question. And the bottom line is, it's a tough one. I'm sure I don't have like a, some hardcore stance on it one way or the other.

Speaker 1:          00:22:31       We'll do. I think it would benefit everyone every 18 year old, if they join the military, it would benefit them. I'm telling you it would benefit them. Do I think it should be mandatory? I don't really think so because I don't want to have a bunch of draftees in the military and if you don't want to join and you want to miss out on having that part in your life, that's your call and that's fine. This is America. You can do what you want. Yeah, that makes sense. Cause on one on one hand you kind of can look at it as like taxes, right? Where, how it led. Just like Kyle was saying. Um, you know, you have to have the paraphrasing, the, the, the pleasure of the honor to serve in once your country's defendant. You know, like that, that should be obvious. And so it's Kinda like couldn't compare it with paying taxes.

Speaker 1:          00:23:14       Right? Taxes go to public service for all this stuff. And we live in this country. We have public service, we all have to pay for it, not just one person. When we all pay tax, a lot of people pay a lot more than other people. Yeah, exactly right. And not more. Yeah, and some people don't really pay taxes. You just said everyone pays their taxes and not everyone pays. I know that. And if so, what if it was all good? Yeah, perfect. Exactly. Part of my point is, so let's say I'm like, Hey, you just paid you to, let's say it's tax time, April 15th whatever. Some people pay taxes year round, just FYI. Yeah, no, I'm just saying.

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       But at the time were called the quarterly [inaudible]. You don't want none. I actually know about that now. Thankfully weren't nuts to think thing. Oh, but you know, let's just say for this example it 15 that's when everyone knows it's all right. And you're like, yeah, I just paid my taxes, you know, whatever. Like I didn't like giving my money away, but that's it. You know, just like people in the draft situation or military, military, military, I didn't want to, I would rather go be a a rake or whatever and, but I'm doing it and boom, I did it. And then you got me, or maybe not me, someone else saying, Oh yeah, I didn't pay my taxes. And then you're like, whoa, wait, wait. You're saying it becomes an honor to pay your taxes? You know? Wish I could agree with you. No, no, no.

Speaker 4:          00:24:25       There's, I think there's a part of your brain, no matter how much you paid for Texas, it is like you do have that feeling like, yeah, I did my part. Even though it sucked, even though it hurt, even though, you know, I would way rather have spent it on a Disney vacation or something like that, like I'm a citizen from something that was productive, generate more business or something like that, you know? Just little things like that, but whatever. You see what I'm saying? No. All right. I mean, I hear you. It's kind of the same thing. That's one way to look at it though, where you can, but the other one way. Yeah. Yeah. But the other way is just like you said, if you get some people who were in there in the military was certain like jobs or whatever, and they don't want to be there.

Speaker 4:          00:25:01       It's Kinda like, it's Kinda too important to have people like that. But you could have, yeah, what you said is actually correct that you could have, you know, elements that just did other things in the military that d would be more aligned with a person's natural desires of what they want to do. Yeah. And now there's something in the navy called needs of the navy. Right. So you would get the navy, you, oh, I want to go get stationed in Hawaii. Like, okay, what are the needs of the navy? Because the needs of the navy come first, not you, not your family. Nothing. Yeah. And, and so the needs and they would come first. Well, yeah. And of course, same thing with like a tax situation where it's like you're, if you don't want to do it, it's kind of hard to be like, I know you don't want to do it, but hey, now that you're here, do what you want.

Speaker 4:          00:25:46       You know, you Kinda can't say that. Otherwise I'll be like, I don't want to be here so I can choose what I can do. Okay. I'm going to do the the most smallest, most late, least time consuming. Like basically I'm gonna do this the least I possibly can because I don't want to be here to be in the military. This is the vault, this is the mandatory military. This'll go and that'll go for it. So you're going to get, it's kind of like get people that would be not doing very much. Yeah, it's essentially like a draft dodger kind of situation. But within, you know, who didn't actually dage it if it, I'm just saying if it were a scenario, like we'll just put them where their interests lie even though they have to be here. Yeah. See what I'm saying. So I'm just saying that's the other side of the coin where it's like, yeah, it's hard to make, make it work in an absolute kind of way. Check. All right. He talked a little bit about clothing troops, what they should wear, and this is just, I thought this was interesting. Our uniform is not only expensive but very, very uncomfortable. The soldiers neither shod nor clothed

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       nor covered the love of appearance prevails over attention to health. And this is one of the most important points demanding our attention. Hair is a dirty ornament for a soldier in once the rainy season has arrived, has had, is never dry. So it sounds to me like he's basically saying he doesn't care how he looks, he's healing to win. They get, so hair is a dirty ornament for a soldier in place of hats. I should prefer helmets. As for shoes, this was interesting. You know, people were minimalistic shoes with out. We'd zero heel to toe drop if you heard that expression. No meaning it's the same level across. So it's any of the barefoot type shoes. They all say, Oh zero heel to toe drop. Meaning there's not an eight millimeter difference between the height of the heel and then it goes down to the height of the toe.

Speaker 1:          00:27:40       This is what he says. As for shoes, I would prefer the soldiers to have shoes of thin level leather with low heels instead of heavy boots. They would be perfectly shod, would and would march with better grace. Since low heels would force them to turn out their toes, stretch their joints, and consequently consequently draw in their shoulders. It's pretty interesting because everyone's all in the rage of minimalistic shoes, which I actually wear shoes that don't have any heel toe drop. Maybe I'm caught up in that fad, but it's cool. But you know what? When we were kids, right? Chuck Taylors? Yeah. Yeah. They have no heel toe drop people so wearing cause they're good to go. That's kind of all right. Well we'll fill only way I know. Well there you go. You're the big time trend. You're, you're a early adopter. Yeah. Again, I didn't know about, I probably chuck Taylor's a too narrow for me to narrow.

Speaker 1:          00:28:37       Yeah, and they don't sell wide ones. I've looked all right. Pay What you got to pay people back to the book. Without going into detail about the different rates of pay, I shall only say that it should be ample. It is better to have a small number of well kept and well disciplined troops than to have a great number who are neglected in these matters. It is not the big armies that win battles. It is the good ones. Economy can boost p pushed only to a certain point. It has limits beyond which it degenerate into parsimony. I had to look that word up by the way. Parsa Motors. Yeah. Occasionally you get one of those. It means just super cheap. Super cheap. That's interesting because that doesn't sound like that Dabney would fall in that category. Parthenon. If your dad would be considered parsimonious, I guess so. I know that my, my dad liked many dads will drive an extra 18 miles to save

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       3 cents a gallon on gas. Is that, is it all bad to do that? No, I don't know why they don't do that. Well, yeah, you drive 18 miles. You're, you're in the ocean most of the time. But yeah, I've heard of that before. Isn't that like a false thing though? Like cause he just kept driving drunk for sure. It's kind of pointless. You know, you get the APP that has the cheapest gas prices in your area. How much time are you spending looking at an APP that you paid $3 for to find out whether you can save 2 cents a gallon on gas. Now I get it, man. I'm cheap. I inherited that. Right. I don't like to spend money. It's hard for me to part with the, with the money, right. Including the tax man by the way. It's offered. So I get it. But I also have to have some, like sometimes my dad could be irrational about irrational.

Speaker 2:          00:30:32       Just straight up crazy. Hey Wall, you could save 2 cents. Yeah. Hey, if you know I, he gets fired up about that too. That's another thing, you know, he always asks me how much the, how much the gas out there in California. I'm like, I didn't know my pay for it. Anyways, we'll stick the nozzle in there and pull the trigger and rock and roll. I got stuff I gotta do. I'm not driving. How much cheaper is gas on base when I didn't know how much cheaper gas was on base, he was beside himself and then we found out it was 8 cents a gallon. Cheaper all and keep you on. Basically you want to go drive over there, wait in line, show you right knee and then we get on base. You got to wait. Cause know. Yeah, come on. Wait, isn't there because parsimonious. Parsimonious.

Speaker 2:          00:31:13       Yeah. Huh. I'm gonna try it. Use Ellen. But that's because the, because it's like a, it's like a win, right? You get a win when you got the deal. You think you've got the psychological when, yeah, yeah. No, that's, that's definitely, that could be it. A little victory. Yeah. I think because yeah, people like that too. Back to the book. Hope encourages men to endure and attempt everything in depriving them of it or in making it to distance. You deprive them of their very soul. Now, that immediately made me think of Stalin Grad when we were reading about stolen rod and the fact that the soldiers, when something would give him a glimmer of hope, it would totally change their attitude when they thought that the German troops were coming to rescue the guys that were installing Grad in the pocket and solid rock, they are all excited and they were happy and he literally said like, everyone's morale went up and then they find out they're not coming in.

Speaker 2:          00:32:10       Just crushed, crushed to morale. Yeah. We think that's based on hope fully. And that you kind of see that in like in like like a workout for example. Like if you have a, in football we, we'd have like conditioning, right? And sometimes they'd just be like, hey, we're just running sprints, wind sprints. They wouldn't say, Hey, we've got 10 wins for instance, is not like that. And after a while, like guys are dying and you know, not dying, but you know, we're getting tired. So the sprints are a lot slower towards it, but they say two more

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       finish hard for all of a sudden everybody can run fast again. You know what I'm saying? Even though, cause you see that little light thing and tone at seconds. Pretty cool. I was kidding. But I do it. And then you watch the hope. Just go back to being slow back to the book. This is, this is pretty heavy. Truly. The only good officers are the poor gentleman who have nothing but their sword and their cape. But it is essential that they should be able to live on their pay. The man who devotes himself to war should regard it as a religious order into which he enters. He should have nothing, no other home than his troop and should hold himself honored in his profession. So there you go. All in, all in. And when people always ask me, especially when I was in about work life balance and I'm like, Hey, oh I'm not the guy to talk about not the good person, especially when I was in the military because this was me.

Speaker 1:          00:33:47       You know, my number one priority hundred percent was the dames and everything else was just kind of, hey, you're everyone else's along for the ride. But I know where I'm going. So the being that devoted to war and it has a power that has a certain, it made, you know, if you've got a guy that's thinking about all the time, I think it was jade, jade and I were talking about something and he said, the person who cares more wins. Yeah, that's, that's accurate. And I want a lot of stuff in my day just because I cared more. I mean, I'm not going to sleep. I'm not, I'm just going to be thinking about this. You're going to go home and this weekend you're going to go and do a family barbecue and you're going to go play baseball with the kids and blah, blah, blah. And I was just like, no, I'm just going to be doing this all weekend. I'm going to be working on this. We're going to win. I'm, I got, um, I care about this. Nothing else matters. So that's, uh, again, is it healthy for work life balance? No, it's not healthy except for to say, if you're that committed to your work, you're a committed person, then that means you're trying to take care of your family. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Am I reaching maybe? Yeah, I think I'm reaching. That's fine.

Speaker 1:          00:35:02       You know, Marissa, a good independent woman that doesn't need emotional support from you all the time, so that she understands that. That was the big thing for me. I think my wife understood that it wasn't meant as an offensive thing. Yeah. I have a job and I really care about my job. Doesn't mean I don't care about you, but my job is right now and I need to do that. Yeah, and even the work life balance. My just a bad husband. No, no, because no, because there is no templated time allotted. You know that you need to spend with these people or those people are at work versus fat. There's no like thing. You know, sometimes if you're like, hey, I need to spend more time with my wife. Your wife's like, Bro, go do leave me alone. You know? Like we, we spent the weekend again, calm down, you know, go to work or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:35:50       Some people like that and it's a spectrum. So work life balance is like, it depends on your wife and you know, in a husband wife situation I suppose instead of instead of trying to take a life work life balance lesson out of this, I think the most important thing to take out of this is, is the level of commitment, right? If you really want to be successful and not just talking about Warren, I'm talking about business, I'm talking about life. If you really want to be successful, you got to, you got to get after it. Yeah. And you see this set the other things aside for now, just the way it is. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. All right. Back to the book. Training drill is necessary to make the soldier steady and skillful, although it does not warrant exclusive attention among all the elements of war is it even is the one that deserves the least.

Speaker 1:          00:36:36       If one accepts those which are dangerous, I tried to figure out what that meant. I just thought opium. That was an opium hit right there. The last part, the foundation of training depends. Oh, this is good but, but okay, so drill. If you know anything about the military drill, especially back in those days, it was a really was a necessary thing because you had to function together as a team and the way you do that, and we still do what's called close order drill in the military now you've seen it go watch the US Marine Corps close order, silent drill team. They do all these really specific maneuvers and they have competitions in high schools between the ROTC classes where you know you're carrying the rifle, you spin, you do that, all that stuff. That's called drill. Yeah. The reason it originated is because you needed to for two reasons.

Speaker 1:          00:37:21       Number one, you actually had to do those motions on the battlefield, raise your rifle, you know, load, remake, ready, aim, fire, and then the next rank will be doing the same thing you had to do in a coordinated method. And the other reason that they kept doing it, according to my drill instructor in officer candidate school, Gunnery Sergeant United States Marine Corps, all the enough last name was seals. That was his last name. Great Guy. Yeah, layers, gunnery sergeant seals, my drum instructor from the United States Marine Corps at officer candidate school. He said, the reason that you're learning this drill is because the reason that we do drill is it because people need to act instantly upon orders. So it, it drills into you a level of obedience when you get told by the left flank march, everyone goes by the right flank, March, everyone goes, you know, so it teaches you that hey, I'm going to go.

Speaker 1:          00:38:13       And that's what they used to use it for. But they still use it now too. So that people get used to the immediate obedience of orders. Now does that get contradicted by things that I talk about all the time on here, but questioning orders and making sure you understand why you're doing. Yeah, it does. Absolutely. But there is a, that's why. That's what it exists for. Yeah. Yeah. And at least the capabilities and the capability is there. Yes, the capability is there. Back to the book, the foundation of training depends on the legs and not the arms.

Speaker 1:          00:38:43       All the mystery of maneuvers and combat is in the legs and it is to the legs that we should apply ourselves, whoever claims otherwise is but a fool and not only in the elements of what is called the profession of arms. So interestingly your personal problem with people that talk about skipping leg day, the, it goes back, it goes back to here. The big guns, the big arms, they didn't want to help us in the, in the art of war, according to Zach's in Hawaii they call it big for nothing, actually big for nothing in Hawaiian means like I guess here they say all go no shell. Right. So that's kind of what having big arms and small legs kind of is as well. Right through. Now you're on board with that. Well yeah. No I never was skipping legs day. You're the one teasing me and I was wondering why is that so funny?

Speaker 1:          00:39:38       But I guess, yeah, that that's fine. Cause you look like a fool. That's it. That's the answer. Dang it goes back. It was back a long time. Even back then people were skipping leg day. Yeah cause they were fools. I'm focusing on the wrong thing and it makes sense. Even like in those terms, it makes sense today. Let me tell you something. The the amount we can, when I was in the team, so I was running training and I still talked guys obviously, but if you think about what's going on the train like people to people, you know, I say all the time, like all of the seal training is not that hard. Right? I say old time, like when I'm talking about buds, I'm telling you the advanced training that you go to, the training that I used to run it, it's, it's freaking really hard.

Speaker 1:          00:40:23       It's really hard. You're in the desert. The desert. No, don't think of sand. Think of rocks. Think of jagged, uneven terrain up and down hills. Then think about you're on night vision, so it's at night. Think about, you have, let's call it about 80 pounds of gear on just on average. That's like the average guy's got 80 pounds of gear on. You're going to get dropped off in the middle of the desert. Again, not the desert, but the rocky, what's it called? Sub? I forget. It's, it's the rocky crazy terrain. It's hard to walk on in the daytime. It's hard to walk on. Now you're at the yard at night. Now you have night vision on, which is great, but my vision is looking far away and you can adjust one of your night vision side. So you have to, and you can adjust one to foreign, one to close, so you can see a little bit, but still your peripheral vision isn't there.

Speaker 1:          00:41:16       Your peripheral vision is gone because there's a tube in front of your head, so you can't really see what's actually underneath your feet. You can look down and then you can see it for a second, but you can't walk around looking down the whole time. You got to look the guy in front of you got to look at your field of fire. So as you're walking, you're making these micro adjustments all the time, adapt to your foot, hitting the ground in some weird spot. And so you get that and then you have that weight on your back and so you get dropped off. Then you patrol 10 kilometers, 10 kilometers maybe. What's that? That's six miles. So, so you're going six miles, then you get six miles. You get to a target area, you get to the target area. You got to get eyes on the target area.

Speaker 1:          00:41:53       You know you'd get eyes on, you climbed the biggest halo round at night, being as quiet as you can. You get to the top of that hill, you look at it, then you go and assault the target. Once you assault the target, guess what you're going for? When you're and the target you are now like almost running. You're running through the thing at night. You're shooting machine guns. Guess what, guys? Get hit. Guys go down. This. Even in training, guys are going down now you're going to carry him. Well, who are you going to carry him? Who's gonna carry him? You are. What are you going to do? How are you going to carry him? You're going to, there's only one way. Sure. Okay. There's stretchers. There's you can be, you can bring litters and we certainly bring litters in the field, but they take some time to set up and you've got to get organized to make that happen.

Speaker 1:          00:42:27       What's going to happen initially is somebody is going to sling that dude on his back. And by the way, that person that weighs 200 pounds has 80 pounds of gear with them. So now we're talking 280 pounds. You're going to put that person on your back and you're going to walk at a high rate of speed through this rocky terrain and you're going to do that for another two to three miles to get out. It's hard. That kind of training, and by the way, this whole time there's no like who are, there's no, hey, come on. There's no, there's no, there's no, you don't even speak it just in silence and just going and everyone knows what you have to do. And so that's why you got to do leg day, not skip leg day because your legs, your legs got to carry that weight. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:43:17       Going back to the book to return to the march about which everyone bothers themselves to the death. But we'll never reach a conclusion unless I reveal a secret. So he's got a secret about maneuvering troops. This is this, I found this interesting, some wish to march slowly, others would march fast. But what about the troops whom no one knows how to make march fast or slowly as the desire or as necessary and who require an officer at every corner to make them turn like some snails and others are running. And this is to advance this column, which is always trailing. It is a common unit to see even a battalion to commence movement. So what he's talking about, if you're moving with a unit, and this happens with even happens with a platoon, but it definitely happens when you get bigger elements, you know, a company sized element where you've got a hundred people that are moving, it's, it's uh, the caterpillar effect, right? Like the front moves. And then it takes a little while for people to catch up and then when they stop, everyone bumps into him and you end up with this just thing that's really, really hard to move. Yeah, and this is so, this is how he says, this is his big secret, shall I say it, this great word which comprises all the mystery of the art and which, which will no doubt be seen as ridiculous, have them march in cadence.

Speaker 1:          00:44:43       That is why these musical marches were instituted and that is why one beats the drum. It is this which no one knows and no one has perceived with this. You can march fast or slow as you wish. The tail will not lose the distance. All your soldiers will start on the same foot. The changes of direction will be made together with speed and grace and the legs of your soldiers will not get tangled up. You will not be forced to halt after each turn in order to start off on the same foot. Your soldiers will not exhaust themselves at quarter as much as that presence. Now, what I thought was interesting about that is it's an obvious answer, right? And now, clearly you're not going to do that in the modern day military in the field. You're not going to play music. So guys could march to it so you can stay in Caden's.

Speaker 1:          00:45:30       But I think it's more important to that. Sometimes we lose things, we lose methods who they're in front of our face, but we don't understand why they were there. And I'll say, I'll tell you, I was thinking of a story. I was running training and one of my guys who was, uh, one of the assistant platoon commanders, Entu bruiser great guy. Hard to choke, real long neck, you know, you can make it happen. You're going to work for it real. Is it some people you might think long neck, easy to choke, right? Yeah, no, this was, his neck was so long and he was strong too. He is dark long and strong Max. So his neck would like band and the gaiety keep breathing. Yeah, it was that long. It was a long neck. So anyways, we were out at this training site and we were doing, he was his, it was his platoon now he was a platoon commander and they were coming over the beach and meaning swimming over the beach and then you go do live fire and this really, so, so they're doing it, they're doing iterations and he's coming up on the beach and is a weapons, you know, you, you, when you get to the beach, your weapons Wet Sandy, cause you go through the surf and it's all jacked up and then you try and shoot your gun and it doesn't work.

Speaker 1:          00:46:47       You've got to clean it and it's just a pain. And he says, Hey man, do you have any like suggestions on how to get my weapon firing once I get over the beach? And I go, yeah man, don't let it get wet. And he was kind of, you know, like really? And I said, yeah, don't let it get wet. Because when you're swimming in, you've got a rucksack. But the rucksack isn't, it's, it's waterproofed. So it kind of floats. And so you can put your weapon on top of your rucksack and you can kind of keep it try there. And when you're just swimming, you just keep it. Now you're not going to keep your weapon completely dry. It's not going to happen. It's going to get wet. But the attitude, if you have the attitude that you're trying to keep it dry, you'll keep it 90% more dry than you would otherwise.

Speaker 1:          00:47:33       And most important when you come through the beach, when you come through the waves, you won't let it get the sand in it. And he kind of looked at me with a funny face of like, are you seriously? How can you keep it dry? And I said, keep it dry. Next time I'm watching him or on night vision, I'm watching him and sure enough way is his weapon barely went in the water and he got up on the beach and boom, it works. Guess what? That's an obvious answer, but sometimes people, we know we just need to have somebody share the obvious answer with us so that we can execute. Yeah, no, that makes sense. The thing is that day. And that's crazy. I didn't know that that marching thing like that's why he marched the cadence that caterpillar affects shuts down. Why there's traffic by the way, traffic exists because of that little effect.

Speaker 1:          00:48:22       That's exactly true. You know one guy, one guy going and the reaction time and the other funny thing he said in here is he says, go watch people dance. You see a soldier dance all night but he can't march for more than an hour without being tired. Why is that? Give him some music. Kind of funny. I didn't want to say that part cause then people started asking me about dancing today. Then we'll see you Dan. No, no talk of dance on the podcast. Back to the book. If the previous war had lasted a little longer in do boobly, everyone would've fought a hand to hand. This was because the abusive firing began to be appreciated. It causes more noise than harm and those who depend on it are always beaten. So what do you mean? I can encapsulate a lot of stuff? What he was talking about was how everyone was so excited to shoot their rifles.

Speaker 1:          00:49:13       And at this time period, the rifles weren't all that accurate. And so it was a bunch of noise, but they weren't always that effective. And it would be better. And by the way, when you, when you had to shoot your rifle, you had to stop. So now instead of charging, we're stopping, we're loading, we're firing, the other rank is firing. And if the other people are moving on you, well they're going to get close enough and they're going to have no now momentum and they're going to overtake you or they're going to overpower you with what? With bayonets and hand to hand combat. So what I thought was interesting about this is he saying, hey, all this noise, it's basically noisemakers for PR for all practical purposes. Their noisemakers and he's saying, and what I was thinking was, it's, this goes to be, this to me is very similar to people that yell a lot, right? You yell a lot, you are someone that's loud, someone that's always talking to him. And he says that people who depended on that are always beaten. And I thought to myself, that's a very accurate statement. Very accurate statement.

Speaker 1:          00:50:11       So don't just talk for the purpose of talking, right? Don't. If you don't have anything to say, that's fine. Be Quiet. Don't say anything. It's actually good here. He talks about the Roman legions. The Romans vanquished all nations by their discipline.

Speaker 5:          00:50:30       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:50:31       no big deal. No, they meditated on war constantly, continually, and they always renounced old costumes whenever they found better. In this respect, they differed from the Gauls whom they defeated during several centuries without the ladder thinking of correcting their errors. So this is clearly the Romans. Okay? We know discipline's important. Talk about it all the time. But more important lesson here is they always renounced old costumes whenever they found better. Boom.

Speaker 5:          00:51:05       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:51:06       Renounced the old customs. When you find better ones, this is something you need to do in your life. It's something that needs you and your business. It's something you needed to do on the mat.

Speaker 1:          00:51:17       Okay? And I'll tell you, going back to the other part, sometimes there's things in Jujitsu that you find a better way and they work for awhile and then you go back to the old way and it works because people are expecting the new way the dean talks to you and say this is a new old move. Yeah, yeah. He just said that the end of the day is a new old move. It, it worked 10 years ago. It wouldn't work five years ago because everyone knew it. Now it'll work again cause everyone forgot it. Yeah. And that's kind of like everyone forgot why, why we use cadence, why we use music. Yeah. We forgot why. We don't know how to March now. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:51:53       Yeah. It's, and it's essentially the same reason why the new move will work because people are unfamiliar, you know, cause you know, you have a certain attack or whatever and then the more people know about that attack, the harder it is to, to be successful with it. And then you find some new variation then that not everyone knows. The football game kind of was like that too, for a little bit. Uh, and then after awhile, all those fundamentals which work essentially the early version of the, of the move. Yeah. Whatever. That's still there. But we've got this new unrevealed move that's getting everyone because they're unfamiliar. It's like us, a surprise kind of where they're just unfamiliar. And then now everyone gets familiar with it and it's like, cool. It was okay. Move. Yeah. But the real good one was that original though. Do you want yeah, but everyone just got you

Speaker 1:          00:52:40       do it. Yeah. And then once everyone gets used to the new one, they'll forget about the old one. Yeah, for sure. Correct. And improve.

Speaker 1:          00:52:50       Renounce your old customers whenever you find better. Now he talking a little bit about peace time and how you maintain your army during peace time. He says, as for the cavalry, it should never be touched, meaning you shouldn't, you shouldn't get rid of any cavalry people. The old troopers and the old horses are the good, and the recruits of either are absolutely useless. It is a burden and it is it an expense, but as indispensable in regard to the infantry. As long as there are a few old heads you can do what you want with the tails. So a horseman is you got the skilled horse and you've got the skilled horse rider and he says in this, I dunno if I'll read it, but then he says he also in here it takes 10 years to make a good a good cavalryman good guide.

Speaker 1:          00:53:38       It's really good on the horse with a really good horse, takes 10 years to make them. So you can't just get rid of that person. But an infantry man, if you've got some good, this is what I liked about it. If you've got good leadership, good leadership with infantry men, hey man, there's some fundamental skills you're gonna need to learn. It will be ready to rock and roll, which is, which is awesome. Good leadership goes a long way. I mean, and again, you have to have, it takes a lot. It takes the same amount of time to make a good at infantry leader because those are skills that take a long time to develop to become a leader of infantry troops. But your basic combat rifleman, you can make them pretty quick, not like it's all, it's a hell of a lot easier than making someone that can ride a horse.

Speaker 1:          00:54:24       So, and then your leadership's gonna go a long way back to the book. In attacking infantry, the two rear ranks are to lower their pikes in this position, the pikes will extend from six to seven feet ahead of the front rank. The front ranks being sheltered in such a manner will I am sure aim with more confidence than if they had nothing in front of them. Besides this, the third rank can ward off blows and defend the first rank, which we'll do, which it will do much better since it is covered by the first two ranks. The second rank, which is armed with muskets, can fire and defend the man in front of him in the first rank. Without the ladder being obliged to stoop. This avoids a serious disadvantage which has incurred in kneeling a dangerous movement because men who are afraid prefer this position, they cannot be made to get up when wanted and is always necessary to halt, to kneel according to my formation.

Speaker 1:          00:55:30       All the men are covered each by each other with reciprocal confidence. The front presents a forest of spears that are parents is formidable and gives confidence to your own troops because they feel its power. So a couple of interesting things there. Obviously it's a cover moves situation and, and, and we're going to work that out. But I thought beyond that, it was interesting that if you've got, if you're going to take a knee, well there's two things that are happening. Number one, you have to stop to take a knee. We're not advancing on our knees. And number two people that are afraid they want to be down there and it can be hard to get them back up. So don't even let them get down there, keep that momentum going. We're looking to keep that momentum going back to the book, those who imagine that, and I think I stayed this every time, usually around this point in the podcast, I'm skipping a lot of the book. Sure. It's just the way it is. We're not going to read the whole book on here. You have to order it yourself. If you want to hear every secret of sacks,

Speaker 1:          00:56:33       those who imagined that the Roman legions were composed of Romans from Rome are very much deceived. They came from all the nations in the world, but their composition, their discipline, and their methods of fighting or better than all those other nations. This is why they conquered them all. Neither were they conquered in their turn on until this discipline had to generated among the Romans. Discipline. We'll get you a long way and lack of discipline will get you killed. Disintegrated. It disintegrated. Talking more about cavalry here. The cavalry should be active and mounted on horses in nerd to fatigue. It should be encumbered with as little baggage as possible and above all should not make the common error of having fat horses.

Speaker 3:          00:57:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:57:29       If they could see an enemy every day, it would only be better for this. Would soon put them in condition to attempt anything.

Speaker 3:          00:57:37       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:57:38       It is certain that the power of power of cavalry is not understood. Why? Because of we have love for fat horses. I had a regimen of German cavalry in Poland with which I marched more than 1500 leagues in 18 months. I maintain that this regiment was more fit for service at the end of this time than another supplied with fat horses. But to reach this condition, they must be gradually accustomed to hardship and hardened by Hans and violent exercise. This will maintain their health and increase their endurance. Likewise, it will make cavalry men of the troopers and give them a Marshall bearing. So you got to train hard. Hmm. I just read all that to basically say, you got to train hard. Even want to be ready to fight. You've got to trade how your fight and don't get on a fat a horse. Apparently.

Speaker 1:          00:58:35       We'll have to ask my wife about that one. She knows more about horses than me or Lafe. Lafe knows about horses. He's from Texas. Everyone from Texas rides a horse. Yeah. Is that the image? Yes. When I go, when I would go overseas, people for everyone in America is basically carrying a pistol on him at all times. That's, that's the, that's the image that people have of America. I liked that image for people to have America too. I mean, I'm sure some people don't like that image, but yeah. You know, be nice when you come here, you can want to come and visit. That's cool. We welcome visitors. Just be nice. Everyone's, everyone's carrying a 45 in their back pocket. Yeah. Can you carry a 45 in your back pocket? You could. I mean, would it recommended no one recommended you get a holster? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, but it's more of an expression. No, no. It's not even an expression, but if you go to another country, they think that we've just got them in our back pocket. Like you carry your wallet and a 45 yeah. What? You see where I'm coming from here? Yes. Is how we roll Miz America.

Speaker 5:          00:59:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:43       I do not. Back to the book. I do not know why armor has been laid aside for the for nothing is either so useful or ornamental. If it be considered, how many troopers perish by the sword and how many are are? How many? Many are dangerously wounded by random and weak shots. Accident accidents against which armor guarantees protection. One cannot avoid acknowledging the benefits of it. It is nothing but indolence and relaxation of discipline that caused it to be laid aside. It is worrisome to carry a queer ass and I'll trail pike and trail a pike half a century to use it a single day, but as soon as disciplined as neglected in the nation. As soon as comfort becomes an aim, it needs no inspiration to foretell. That ruin is near the Romans conquered all peoples by their discipline in the measure that it became corrupted, their success decreased when the emperor Gracian permitted the legions to quit their cure asses and helmets because the soldiers complain they were too heavy. All was lost. The ball bearings whom they had defeated during so many centuries vanquish them. Well, that's all. That's all. People stop wearing their armor because it's heavy. Body armor is heavy.

Speaker 5:          01:01:16       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:18       Helmet your helmets heavy. Yeah. You want that? A little tiny helmet. You want the whole, the take out the back plate of our body armor. Oh, probably won't get shot there. No. Yeah. Was it, who was taught was that Jody thought talking about that like, oh my God. Yeah. Though those guys going into that, they will, they were going into an operation. They didn't wear their body armor. Yeah. Cause they were like, Dang it, we're not going to happen. Oh, pasta we plus we w we light and maneuverable. Hmm. That's the thing you say. Yeah. Yeah. It's like skipping your workout and saying, well I need to rest it. Like recovery today. Yeah. Kind of the same thing. Very similar. Yes. I'll give you that one where I go. Yeah. He obviously, um, as soon as discipline is neglected in a nation, guess what's the same thing with your personal life?

Speaker 1:          01:02:03       Obviously back to the book or the trooper should have a goatskin bottle like those used in hot countries instead of a canteen or a barrel to hold liquors in. Traded this with his linen stockings, cap a cord and a other necessities is to be putting the bottom of a sack which will roll up with his coat and can be fastened with two straps behind him. This will reduce the monstrous load which has now carried by the cavalry. It is necessary from time to time to inspect the baggage and forced the men to throw away useless items. I have frequently donut one can hardly imagine all the trash they carry with them year after year. The poor horse has to carry everything. It is no exaggeration to say that I have filled 20 wagons with useless rubbish, which I have found in the review of a single regimen.

Speaker 1:          01:02:53       So people will tend to carry a lot, a lot that they don't need. And that weighs down on you. I think I've talked about this before, but the backend broken to do. We had these winter paltunes tunes, which I never did one, uh, out on the east coast, they had these winter platoons and you're going long distance on cross country skis. Right. You know what those are? Yeah. It long, long distances and that is a very, you're basically like running a marathon. And so the guys were super anal about the weight that they carry to me. Yeah. So like they would, you know how the backpack, a backpack has, you know, a strap that you pull, you pulled a tightknit, they'd get it to the port where it was supposed to be, give it a little bit second and cut director, cut the rest off. And so it's, they don't want to carry that little extra four inches of nylon, not going to do it. They had every piece of gear that they had would be like that. Yeah. Dope to warriors at team to truth. Here's an interesting thing in passing through water, the horses must never be allowed to drink.

Speaker 5:          01:03:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:58       A man who holds to water, his horse will stop a whole army. When this happens, the officers should hasten to the spot and instead of fruitless reprimands and ill timed mercy, they should instantly chastise the offender.

Speaker 5:          01:04:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:12       Nothing is of such importance for the preservation of the cavalry.

Speaker 5:          01:04:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:16       Otherwise, the affection the men they have for their horses, we'll have them halting little or much, and then it is impossible for them to recover their ranks without gallon discipline. People get that little affection further for not just, you know, I wasn't thinking horses here. I was thinking about like being on a long patrol or in the workplace. You want your team to go and every time you, you grant that little bit of mercy. Right? Am I saying be merciless straight? Same driver? No, but when you do it, you start develop that trend and now it throws other things off and sometimes you just gotta be, Hey, no, be quiet and execute. Yeah, got to go.

Speaker 5:          01:05:00       Got It. Go

Speaker 1:          01:05:04       in time of peace. And in winter quarters, in time of war, their horses should be kept in conditioned by violent exercise or runs at least three times a week. I like this idea of violent exercise. I'm going to start doing violent exercising. Yeah, that's good. Like violent. Exercising the same. Severe usage is also proper for the heavy cavalry charge at those times. It is in the field. It is only in the field, but they must be managed carefully to keep them in flesh and the squadrons complete and strong, and this is interesting, the best chance of teaching them to stand fire is when the infantry is practicing. They should advance on the fire and walk and be kept calm. Accosting accustoming them to go closer and closer. They should never be beaten but stroked and encouraged, encouraged in the space of a month. They will be so accustomed to it that they will even put their nose on the muzzle of the muskets without any fright or surprise.

Speaker 1:          01:06:08       Then they are all right. Nevertheless, they should not be allowed to approach to close for once they get burned, you will not be able to bring them near again. This ordeal must be reserved for the day of battle. That was good. That to me reminded me of what Jordan Peterson was talking about Ed way or the warrior kid. How you slowly inoculate people. You don't throw him into the F, you don't bring them right up to the firing line and start shooting the guns and let them get freaked out horribly. You bring them a little distance. He let them listen from afar and then bring a little bit closer and then next thing you know they're good to go. They're standing in the line. What do you call that? What did Jordan Peterson call that? Exposure? Yeah, gradual exposure. Therapy exposures. Graduated exposure therapy. Something. It's something, yeah, it was something like that until it cover, move a little bit of that.

Speaker 1:          01:06:59       I am convinced every unit that is not supported is a defeated organization. Infantry should always be supported by cavalry and cavalry by infantry covered move work together. Support. Here's a little note back to the book. The general or commander in chief of an army should have a standard to be carried ahead of him as a mark of his rank, so he's talking about flags. This is, this also has a purpose. Anyone searching for him will know instantly where to find him, especially in battle and the troops seeing the standard will know that the general is observing them. So one thing we did and they do in the military as they, you, when you're giving your brief on how the mission is going to go, you brief location of leadership, there's a, Oh guys, we're going to take down these eight buildings. I'll be here in this building, uh, on the top floor.

Speaker 1:          01:07:53       Boom. So if you need me know where to come find me, something happens. Hey, where's this platoon leader going to be yet? Once we get our targets here, I'm going to come over here. I missed out on the backside with a breach took place if you need me, that's where I'll be. So everyone got it. So you know where everyone is and is he talking about like having a a standard that's like a, like a symbol. It's a flag. Yeah, the actual flag. An actual flag he's wearing. Matt wouldn't really know we didn't do that because isn't there like

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       a thing? Yes. That's saying like, Hey, you don't want it. Like, what was it? I want to say saving private Ryan. He's like, don't salute. Yeah, year, whatever. Cause I don't want the enemy to see where. Yup. Yeah. You definitely don't want to mark your position when these guys are general. And as a matter of fact, and I'm trying to think of what book we recently did, where he was talking about like, yeah, if you're seeing running around, if you're a radio man or you're seen running around giving direction, you're going to get shot. Yeah. Yeah. The officer that was, he was Vietnam, I think it was a, I think it was the battle I drank. But yeah, they're talking about that. Oh yeah. It definitely was a battle of wide drank. It was, cause when they were leaving they said like within, within minutes the leaders had been killed in a radio man had been killed.

Speaker 2:          01:09:01       The ones that were still with their elements. So yeah, that's not something you want to do. But what we would do is brief where we are going to be so that everyone on the team knew based on a terrain feature. Yeah. You know, hey, here's this. Here's this building, or here's this knoll of this mountain, or here's this intersection's road. That's where I'll be. That's where I'm, that's what I'm planning to be. So now people know where you are. It makes sense. I mean he had an additional thing there when when he said, um, so that, you know, the general watching kind of thing. Yeah. I guess that wouldn't really apply to your situation. No, it wouldn't apply. Although like in the military when the general is visiting and as a two star general, they've raised a two star flag. Everyone knows it so, okay.

Speaker 2:          01:09:48       So I guess, yeah, you're right. So it will be real circumstantial like during the war combat situation. Gotcha. Now he talks about the companies and again he calls them centuries, which is basically a company sized element of around a hundred guys. And he's saying that they should have their own little symbols as well and their own standards back to the book. If the standards are distinguished by their different colors, the actions of every century will be conspicuous. This will create the greatest emulation because both officers and soldiers will know that they are seen and that their countenance, conduct and behavior are not ignored by the rest of the army. The men as well as the officers will tell of it in the field and in garrison there exploits will be constant. The constant subject of conversation. I thought that was kind of a cool idea. You know, if you're, if you're flying the flag then people are watching you and so you better act. You'd better come correct or represents. Yeah. You better represent actually I like come crack does come correct. Back to the book after the Organization of military troops, military discipline is the first matter that presents itself. It is the soul of armies that is such a nice ring to it is the soul of the as well,

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       but I suppose we'll talk about that later. Back to the book. If it is not established with wisdom and maintained with unshakable resolution, you'll have no soldiers regiments and armies will be only contemptible armed mobs more dangerous to their own country than the enemy. It is a false idea that discipline, subordination and slavish obedience, debase courage. It has always been noted that it is with those armies in which the severest discipline is enforced, that the greatest deeds are performed. Many generals believe that they have done everything as soon as they have issued orders and that they are and they order a great deal because they find many abuses. So he's saying they're like when a general feels like he's talking about a bad general, what a general feels like. They've done everything as soon as they've given their order and since that's what they do, they give all kinds of orders or ordered you to do this and I'm already to do that.

Speaker 1:          01:12:12       I'm going to order you use something else. Here's what he says. This is a false principle proceeding in this fashion. They will never reestablished discipline in an army in which it has been lost or weekend. Few orders are best, but they should be followed up with care. Negligence should be punished without partiality and without distinction of rank or birth. Otherwise you will make yourself hated. One can be exact and just and beloved at the same time as feared severity must be accompanied with kindness. But this should not have the appearance of pretense but of goodness. And this is just a little note, I thought everyone should know whippings need not be severe. The more moderate they are, the more quickly we'll abuses be remedied. Since all the world will join in ending them. So even when you're whipping your people, you know, be a little bit more judicious.

Speaker 1:          01:13:21       We have, uh, this is, this is good too. We have a, a pernicious custom in France have always punishing with death. I'll soldier caught pillaging is hung the result. Now what do you think the result of that would be? That he's going to say, I'm quizzing you. What's your guess if you, if you, um, are pillaging called pillaging, you're going to get home. What do you think the, what do you think that happens because of that happens to who? What do you think? Why should we not hang people for pillaging? Do you think there's a lot of pillage and going on? If you get caught pillaging, they hang you or your fellow soldiers. Do you think they pillage? I say, no. Okay, you're wrong. The result is that no one arrests him because they do not want to cause the death of a poor devil who is only trying to live if instead we were only turned him over to the guard to be putting chains, contend to bread and water for one, two or three months or put to work in, in at any of the labors that always have to be done in any army, and then they were sent to his regiment before a battle or when the general wished everyone would agree with this punishment and the officers of the patrols would arrest them by the hundreds.

Speaker 1:          01:14:30       Soon there will be no pillaging because everyone would join in putting it under control. So it makes sense. That is the reason I asked you that, which I don't normally do is because I thought the same thing. I was like, well, what's, where's he going with this? Oh yeah. It's obvious. Why don't you think about it? You're not going to report one of your guys for stealing something if the punishment was death. Right. You know what that is? That's like that's like small picture versus big picture. Small picture. The small picture is like yeah cause cause you just look at it as yourself, right? You get your bubble in your head. You're like I wouldn't pillage if it, if it, if it was death, I wouldn't pillage and that's how you're looking at it. But no big picture is like hey apply that to everyone applied to the whole community.

Speaker 1:          01:15:08       Exactly right. If you tell him this guy pillaging, you just sentenced him to death. If you tell on him, maybe you turn them in and whatever. That's what you did. Good point. And it's, I just remembered somebody pointed out to me, you remember rifleman Harrison. It starts off when my rifle and Harris has to execute a guy and I said, I said on the podcast, Hey, this guy's getting executed basically for desertion and being drunk. What I didn't realize is if somebody sent me an email or a social media message, they said, hey, the reason that guy was getting executed was because he had taken the money for like 16 enlistments and kept disappearing. So when you do get a signing bonus, hey, here's here's, it was probably nothing but you know, here's, here's 10 quid or pound sterling or whatever, here's 10 pounds sterling, oh you're joining the army, cool, here's 10 and then you take that money, go get drunk and get crazy and then you do it again and then you do it again in a different area because they have no internet.

Speaker 1:          01:16:04       They have no way of knowing that this is the guy when they finally catch him, he's getting sentenced to death. Now do I think as you get sentenced to death either for that? Not really, but he was doing something more severe than what I had mentioned on the podcast. So I just wanted to, while I'm thinking about that, set the record straight, but the, the main point here for me, it's the secondary effects, right? You think you're going to have? The primary effect is, Oh, if we do this, no one's going to, if we're going to kill you, if you get caught pillaging, no one's gonna, no one's gonna pillage anymore. No, actually no one's gonna report it anymore cause your punishment is too strong. This is also how, this is also how and why. When people think that, oh, if someone's in the military, the soldiers just do what they're told wrong.

Speaker 1:          01:16:46       The soldiers actually there, there's secondary effects. Oh, you're going to kill the guys. No, we're not going to report it then. Yeah, so there's, there are secondary effects. Even though they'd been ordered to do that, and they're soldiers and they have disciplined, they've been training, he's bragging about discipline all the time. Guess what? They don't Paul that order because the order sucks. That's what we got to remember. Not just about the military, but about business too. You give people dumb orders or you give people things that don't make sense, they're not really going to execute it the way you'd want them to, and I'll tell you something else. You don't want them to execute that way. Cause if they got hundreds of people pillaging and you now end up murdering hundreds of own your own people, you're affecting your own army, you're going to get deserters were working in army like that. It's the same thing with a business. You start laying out severe punishment, punishment that doesn't make sense, isn't reciprocal to the crime that was committed. I mean you pillage. Think about what pillaging is. I took some bread from the store. Cool. We're going to shoot you the head. Dang. The punishment did not fit the crime. Yeah, in that case.

Speaker 1:          01:17:41       All right. [inaudible] he's talking about where to build, where to build tactical positions and he says, and this is just the same thing you said earlier about people, but he's talking about basically talking about terrain. Now nature is infinitely stronger than the works of man. Why not profit from it? Meaning use a river, use a hill, use use terrain to build your defensive positions. Don't just use a shovel. Same thing that he talked about earlier with with human beings. Now another piece, many persons believe that is advantageous to take the field early and this is coming right back. Sun Tzu art of war, be there first. Yeah, Saks maybe doesn't agree with that a little bit. Here they are. Right. What does the question of seizing an important post? Otherwise, it seems to me that there is no need to hastened and that one should remain in winter quarters longer than usual.

Speaker 1:          01:18:43       So he goes on to talk. Winter quarters means you're, you're gonna go out in the field. Well, we're gonna go out in the field now and we're going to be cold, wet and miserable for the next three days while we wait for the enemy to show up. And now they show up fresh. Who's going to do better in the battle? Yeah. So just to think about, I used to say the, the military used to say all the time, you know, you've got to be forward leaning. You ever heard that expression? [inaudible] yeah. Got To be forward leaning. And I would say, let's not be so forward leaning that were in the leaning rest of leaning rest is the pushup position. Which they would leave you in for a long periods of time. A lot of different training situations. So sometimes you get so proactive gets so leaning forward, a forward leaning that you're in leaning rest and you're wasting energy. Just trying to be all prepared. Like you'd see some guys warm up. You do such a good warm up that you're tired. Yeah. You went so far forward leaning in the leaning rest and then the other thing is to not warm up at all. Now you're not ready, so you've got to find what you got. That's the dichotomy of leadership. You got to find a balance between those two.

Speaker 3:          01:19:40       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:19:43       Another good point here. Back to the book, it is absolutely necessary to accustom soldiers to labor. If we examine Roman history, we find we shall find that republic looked on ease and indolence as the most formidable enemies.

Speaker 3:          01:20:02       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:20:03       The console's prepared their legions for battle by rendering them indefatigable rather than have them idle, they employed them on unnecessary works. Continual exercise makes good soldiers because it qualifies them for military duties. By being habituated to pain, they insensibly learn to despise danger. The transition from fatigue to rest. Enervates them meaning weakens them. They compare one state with another and idleness. That predominant passion of mankind gains ascendancy over them. They then murmur at every trifling inconvenience and their souls soften and they're emasculated bodies. Yeah. So what he's saying is people get used to the soft ways people get used to the easy life. And if you let them get used to it like you, you, when you want to do something hard, when it's time to do something hard, you're not ready for it. Yeah. Every minute that Charlie's out in the bush getting stronger, every time, almost every day at night I'm spending in this hotel, it's apocalypse now.

Speaker 1:          01:21:15       Every night I'm sitting in this hotel getting softer. Every night Charlie's out in the bush getting stronger. That's what he's talking about here. That's what he's talking about. But now do I agree with having people do unnecessary works? No, I don't. Because people see right through that and it just, you're just being stupid and taking are going to see that. They're gonna say, why are we doing this? Dig The hole, Phillip. Back up, dig the hole, fill it back up. No, don't do that. But you know, we're going to a training exercise. When you're training exercise, we're going to get stronger. We're going to get, we're going to dig a hole, we're going to put, you know, set it up for a perimeter. Then we're going to move to another situation is if we have to back away or, or collapse our perimeter. Cause when you collapse a perimeter, you've got to fill that whole back end.

Speaker 1:          01:21:56       Otherwise when the enemy comes to attack you, they use it. So you got to fill that whole back end. So let's run a real drill. And by the way, let's make it into a little contest and see how fast we can dig in. And then once we get it dug in, we're going to set up when see how fast we can collapse and get it filled back in. We're doing it at the end of it, we're going to give out some prizes and have a beer. Right? That's a good tactic by the way. I like to make a, um, whether it be a game or, yeah, you told her is Charles gamified Chelsea us the game of hockey game of vacation. Like if you're moving, you know, you don't when you're moving your house or whatever and how fast can I get this stuff packed up or let me use it as a little workout, little metcon.

Speaker 1:          01:22:36       We got to move all of these boxes upstairs, two floors, whatever. Let me use it as a workout. It kind of makes it more enjoyable as well. But at the same time you get the results of a, of a little workout right there. Here, let me ask you this about that. When you said you didn't agree with the, the unnecessary, unnecessary works, this is, what about um, like pushups as punishment for example, or a Kettler exercise? An interesting one. Cause, cause I think, I think like with kids, if you make burpees a punishment, they don't like it. Or if you make it a reward,

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       they liked them, then you're better off clear it. Yeah, I agree. I do that by the way. Yeah, that's good. You make it a reward. Yeah, like a we'll need the cool people do burpees. That's what it is. They see dead doing burpees, Dead Dune, the end of these whatever exercises or whatever. Only cool people do it. I kind of pushed hard on that too, but it's unfair. But no. The question is though, in the military, in the military, not kids, no calisthenics or definitely punishment in the military. Yeah, straight up. It's not until you transitioned out of the boot camps that you get away from that now in the seal teams, like they don't, you don't do calisthenics as punishment. I will say that if you mess up, like for instance when I was running training, if the guys performed poorly, they were going to have more down men getting, this is a training, I'm talking about fake down men, but they're going to have more men that couldn't walk.

Speaker 2:          01:24:01       That's more men that have to be carried. That's punishment in its own right. That's a punishment. If you, when I was running communications course when I was a younger enlisted seal, if you missed a communications window, you had to walk a longer distance. If you missed multiple, you're going to have to walk tragic distances. Now. It wasn't just a natural result of you missing missing. Did you impose that? Fine. Just imposed yesterday was imposed and they knew it was imposed. Okay. And and so, yeah, you, if you miss in the seal teams, if you miss the extraction point with a boat's coming to pick you up after a dive, well now you got to swim to the new exotic, new, the pickup point. Guess what? The new pickup point isn't close because you've compromised. Now you're above the surface. Do you need to get away?

Speaker 2:          01:24:52       And so that means you got to swim an extra, you know, maybe it's an extra hour of surface swimming with a rig on it, which is not fun. But it doesn't sound fun cause you can't, you're, you're not just, you're not just having fun. Right. It's called turtle back. You're laying on your back cause it's really awkward. It's, it's, it's comfortable to dive with our dive rig. We have a dive rig that's, it's called a rebreather and it goes on your chest and it's small. It's not, it's not tiny. Closed circuit. It's closed circuit. Yeah, look at you look at you big time. So it's a closed circuit dive rig, but when it runs out you can't, it doesn't work anymore so you have to swim and we do something called turtle back generally, which is basically you're laying on your back and you're just fending and it takes a long time to move very far and it's not comfortable. So the punishment is in training. If you miss your extraction point, that's fine. You just got to swim to the alternate extraction point. The alternate extraction point is not going to be close by because you screwed up. Same thing with if you miss your helicopter extraction because you took too long on target and then you got bogged down and it took you a long time to move all these down people. That's, I mean it happens. Understand that,

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       but now you have to walk to the secondary extraction point, which happens to be six kilometers up a hill. Yeah, see, but that's, to me, and this is me pinking whatever, 10 seconds about it. That seems like that makes perfect sense. In fact, that seems like a cool little strategy because in real life that's how it works. You use the bus, you ride the bus to school, you miss the bus, you're walking to school or riding your bike, whatever. It's kind of that thing that's, that's how life deals it to you a lot of the time. Like these types of things, what you're saying. But let's say, hey you, you know, your shoes aren't shined or whatever. I Dunno, aren't shying, give me 50 push ups or they don't do it in the seal teams. They definitely do it in the army. They definitely do it in the Rangers Rangers that they're dropping down all the time and, but no, we don't do that.

Speaker 4:          01:26:54       And so that's the question though. Do you, do you agree with that or do you even think about that kind of stuff? I don't think about that kind of stuff. Yeah. I think being, I would say that I, that I would not do it when I was in a military leadership position just because I would rather, I dunno. Yeah, it's weird. It feels like it just makes sense when I know that the army runs it that way. It makes sense. And by the way, when the army does it, and I, I shouldn't even say anything else about the way the army does it cause I'm not, I don't know exactly how they implement that strategy. So next time we have Tim Kennedy on, we'll get them to give us a full debrief on that and we'll get another, another, a range around here to give us a full debrief on that.

Speaker 4:          01:27:35       Here's something, so I was watching the show, ran this random show me my wife before we were married, when we were just dating whatever. We'd watch these random shows and it was a kind of like a reality show, kind of like a competition show. But it was, I think army, like you know, you grab regular people, put them in army scenario, you give them like missions and it's like, cause they have a ranger, they have a best ranger every year. They have a best ranger competition, which are really hardcore competition. Well, it was, it was, you know, it's a lot like the FTX a lot like that, but it's a whole like, you know, you're there for like a month or whatever and same but a lot of drill sergeant type situations dropping, give me 2050 whatever. Right. So it was towards the end of the season or whatever and this girl was like, she was like, Dang, look how strong and like muscular my arms are now.

Speaker 4:          01:28:24       This is just from all the push ups we had to do and stuff like that. Just by happenstance. Sure. She was getting punished. Sure. She was learning to you follow directions more meticulously and all this stuff that you learned from, you know, the whole, you know, orders versus punishment situation, but as kind of a byproduct if you will, she has some physical strength. No. You know, wonder if that has something to do. Maybe you're definitely, you're definitely making people stronger. There's no doubt about it. Yeah. So that's all positive for sure. Yeah. There's no doubt the great bright biproduct of, of calisthenics as punishment is you get stronger. But like

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       in the, in the seals it's weird. It's weird. It's not a thing. It's not a thing. Okay, you're going to drop down and give me 50 like that deliberately. I never saw that happen. A single, it might've happened with new guys sometimes like occasion, like a new guy that you're not getting through to him. Okay. Guess what? But even with new guys, if you really want to get through to who got what, you want them to be good at his tactics, not push up to people in teams. You're supposed to do pushups on your own. Man was like, we're not in here to teach you how to do pushups. Like you need to, you need to be in shape. But we want to make better things to do what I was going to say. But here, but at the same time you can't help but wonder.

Speaker 2:          01:29:41       Maybe that's just like, that's a certain way of looking at it, which is good. Seems obvious. Seems effective to me. But what if there's something like that, you know, like something from back in the day, some old school fundamental principle that that's kind of why you do it. That's super innovative. Maybe that's why in the teams they don't do it because they want you to be self disciplined. Not like specific, yeah. Not, not self. Not disciplined by the group but in post. But yeah, you don't want to impose discipline interest so well regardless, I think that you should train hard because you don't want to have your soul gets softened inside of your emasculated Bhakti. That just sounds like something, I don't want to be a part of that, so I'll keep training back to the book. There is more skill in one might think. Then my then one might think and making poor dispositions intentionally, but one must be able to change them into good ones in an instant.

Speaker 2:          01:30:41       So he's talking about how you set yourself up in a bad position only to let the enemy try and maneuver on that. Put your waiting for me when you're ready and do something. You change your position and do something good like in Jujitsu when you're getting let someone set up a triangle, but you're just trying to pass their guard. Gotcha. Yeah. Nothing is more disconcerting to the enemy. He has counted on a certain thing, has disposed himself accordingly and at the instant of attacking it has changed. So, so this is, this is pretty cool, right? This is a good thing to remember. I like when you talk about us is psychological effect that it has on the enemy. So the enemy sees something, they expect something, they want something to go a certain way. So they arrange themselves for it. And then right when they're getting ready to execute it, they realize it wasn't what they thought.

Speaker 2:          01:31:34       And he says, there's nothing more disconcerting. And I'd say that's true with a person to the unexpected is what disturbs people. Especially you see this all the time in MMA where a guy gets close to a submission and then he'd get, the other guy gets out and he expanded on gender, genders. You can see the, you can see the, the, the moral draining from their face when it present. It's bad sometimes. Dude, sometimes he go, he goes on, I repeat. Nothing confuses him so greatly and leads him into more serious faults. If he does not change his disposition, he will be defeated. And if he changes them in the presence of the enemy, he will still be defeated. Human Spirit cannot meet it. I'm trying to think of how that affects someone's psych. Oh yeah. It affects, it definitely affects you psychologically. Like you throw the, you think it would get this person, that triangle, you put it on there and then all of a sudden, boom. You realize it's not just that you missed the triangle, it's so you realize that you got played and that doesn't feel good and that can definitely hurt your morale. Yeah. Big Time. That's a little different than just missing the move when you realize you got set up actually,

Speaker 4:          01:32:53       that it messes up your whole game. So, okay, so you wrote with stilts, right? Yeah. Okay. So that's, that's a, I don't want to say that's his whole game, but that's his game right there. So like if you go, you know, side control or mount or whatever, he has dangerous, we wants to there one. Yes, exactly right. So it's like, and every once in a while you get rolling with them like kind of hard. It'll seem like he's trying to defend them out, but he's really letting you think that you got the mountain right. You know, cause even if you're like, if is letting you mount, you know they're letting you mouth and if they're going to spring some sort of a trap, it's going to be more obvious if they're letting you do it. But you get them where he kind of lets you do it to the point where you don't realize he's, yeah, you just got, and then from there after a while he keeps doing stuff like that too. You're like, Bro, I don't even really want to do anything to him because he's just going to send me, this is just a bunch of traps right now. So it messes up your whole game. You can't do anything on your own accord though. It's not like he's preventing you from doing anything. It's like you're preventing yourself now that's a, that's a situation he has to deal with.

Speaker 4:          01:33:54       But actually actually I figured it out. I figured out, I didn't figure it out. I figured out a method to deal with just that whole scenario with him, by the way. And he even asked me afterwards, so I was like, oh, let's, I was going hard. And I was, you know how you get real like weary like okay, I know he's gonna send me. So it was real uneventful role. So I was like, Hey, let's go roll again. And then I just loosened up and basically allowed him to spring whatever trap he wants, I need. Danny did all this stuff and he was like, Hey, you were rolling a lot lighter in that time. I was like, no bro, I'm just trying to, I'm trying to turn on the lights to all your traps that you sit, you know? So it's Kinda like that thing just comes with like the type of training. Like you can't regard the training as a competition. Yeah. You got to go in and be like, you are not learning anything. Yeah. But man, you know, in a war battle or in a competition scenario, it's like, I'm trying to think if I ever got played like that on the battlefield. You know, sometimes we'd hit a target and it was real obvious that, you know, we had,

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       I wouldn't say set up, but like there's no one there. Like clearly the information that we got was wrong and you'd be kind of like Dang, you know, be like man that that wasn't good. And it really, on a real rudimentary level it, that's what an IED is. You know, it's like they want to make it look like a trashcan or a regular, there's something you have to address or something like that. You know, some, a place where you have to go anyway, the road, I don't know what a, on a real simple level, that's kind of what that is. So now you're like shooting all, we've got to be weary of everyday things, normal protocol. We've got to be weary of that. That's a, that's a, that's a digger on the psychology for sure. Back to the book. I do not care for either one. Oh sorry. It's his lines and entrenchment. So he's talking about lines and entrenchments meaning defensive positions. I do not care for either the one or the other of these works. When I hear talk of lines, I always think I am hearing of talk of the walls of China. The good ones are those that nature has made and the good entrenchments are good dispositions and brave soldiers.

Speaker 2:          01:36:07       Again, just capitalizing on nature and saying that brave soldiers are more important than your position. Man always fears the consequences of danger more than danger itself. Totally true. When, and I'll tell you what's equally or you could throw in there as the w the anticipation of danger is probably the worst thing. You know, I see this, I see a lot of kids on the wrestling mat right now cause it's wrestling season and you can see kids get nervous before they get on the map, but then once to get them the math during the game and now you're, now you're doing your job. But the anticipation of what could happen. Yeah. Drives people crazy. When is that like, you know, cause you gotta you felt that before bringing it back to the day when we were competing. Yeah. That like Jujitsu tournament. Civil war especially back actually your, one of your last competition was my first competition or way?

Speaker 2:          01:37:05       Yeah. Where was that in la? It's called like the Pan Am's of submission grappling. It wasn't the Pan Am's Pan Ams. It was like I think like submission grappling and it was, no, how did I do? Uh, I dunno. I Dunno. I remember, remember I remember seeing all the pictures cause one of the, it's funny, one of the like tournament, it was a tournament. Yeah. So I remember Alicia photos. Remember that Anna who ran it? Who ran the tournament? I have no idea. I didn't even know there was tournaments and I saw one hour or brand at the time was like, yeah, the term. I was like, oh we can have tournament. I was like boom. So I just jumped on it real quick. What was the iconic photo? I say it's iconic because it's a kind of a much strong word, a very strong, it's not a clinic at all actually, but it's okay. I'm so, I'm, we, I have this guy, his name is Jim. You'll probably know Jim. He, uh,

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       I have him in a, it's not an American, it's a straight arm lock and I wound up tapping him out. And Alicia photos though. That was the photographer at the time. The main one really good picture of it. It was such a good picture. It was in the front of her website. The picture. Right. That's why I call it iconic photo full on this. Everyone knows that photo. Everyone, they probably do if they're competing back in the day, if they know Lisa Phillips Anyway, um, the full on like novice division. Right. I was like, I had been trying for two months, twice a week, by the way, for two months. Boom. Enough. I'm still just dominating out there right now. I actually lost, I lost my first match. Took third. Nonetheless, it doesn't matter. Um, so I know that you did it because when I was looking through the pictures, it was you compete, I think you were competing against like, so could you or somebody I think, but I remember [inaudible] yeah, well it was maybe, I don't know, some other black guy, but I don't know. I remember it was you, cause I remember like you, I'll have to check that out and then the last to explore that. But what was the point that, oh yeah, waiting for the match is like, that's the nerve wracking part. Like growling, even when you step on the match and you see the guy in front of you getting right by, that's not nerve racking at all. That's like everyday you see that

Speaker 2:          01:39:14       iconic picture of Sarge is a pretty iconic, and he, it was going against one of the Gracies kids. So it was Henner or I think it was Hallock was at Holland and he's, but he's double like him. You know what I'm talking, sergeants got like the sadness double heck, which sergeant has a savage is another thing. When I see these, by the way, talking about Brian, sergeant, uh, one of my buddies who has a Jiu Jitsu school in Connecticut, it's called Jujitsu life, but he is, he's a good wrestler. But when I see these kids and he, he wrestled a Poway high school, which is, uh, one of the best wrestling high schools maybe in the country. I mean, it's definitely incredible program. And he went there and wrestled there. And I see occasionally I'll see a kid that's just has sergeants attitude. And I saw one of this last tournament, this kid was just all over it and go, I mean, it looked, it didn't look fair, right?

Speaker 2:          01:40:18       I mean he was just murdering this kid from Poway was getting after. It was pretty awesome to watch and you could see just boom, boom, boom is hitting the devils. But it reminded me of the iconic picture of Sarge. Oh, there's a picture of it. So yeah, there's a picture of sergeant. They put him on. They, it was, it was, it was one of those pictures that was so good that they put it like on the covers, I think. I don't know if it was that one or if it happened later in the match. He was double liking him out of bounds, like he was into the table.

Speaker 2:          01:40:52       So you gotta, you gotta Watch out for sergeant double legs, they'll put you on your, I asked quick. Yup. And he wants to start one. Hard to submit. So like you just got taken down. That's two points, right? And now what are you going to do? Because you can't sweep sarge right card. I mean, of course you can, but it's hard. Yeah. You only have a few minutes and it's hard to submit. Oh, but you got back to your feet. Cool. He just got taken out of. Yeah. Yeah. That's the rub with the real good judo guys are wrestling guys. That's the rub. What's the rub? Oh, how do you solve that problem? Me become a better wrestler, typically. That's not it. Yeah, Tyrone Woodley, Tyrone Woodley fought Damian my year and Damien. Damien is an incredible Jujitsu player and he couldn't get tiring down to the mat.

Speaker 2:          01:41:43       And every time he shot I would hit my son. And because every time, every time Damian shot, he would s tire and would just stuff the shot and I hit my son and go, that's why you wrestle. That's where you Russell boy, because you are going to be able to take people down. And then once you get to the ground, if you have the Jujitsu, well now you've got problems because the tire and didn't want to go to the ground with Damien. No, because that would have been very problematic for him. But Tyron Woodley is a wrestler. Oh you know, was that you who said that the difference between someone who can wrestle versus a restless wasn't mean laser. And that's why I say that's not the problem. That's why I say that's not the solution. If you have a wrestler, all of these taking you down and the solution is to get better or ethylene the sound solution because you want to get better at something that this guy is probably getting better.

Speaker 2:          01:42:33       And this is just, chances are, I'm not saying it's an absolute, but he's probably a getting better, be already super good at it. So it's like the solution is that you say something and he's 12 years ahead of you. Yeah. He's eight years ahead of you in a wrestling. Yeah. Yeah. So that's not the solution. I don't know what to do. I'm not saying don't wrestle. Well I think I'll tell you what the s what I think the solution is off the top of my head. You learn enough wrestling and then you figured out how to incorporate your Jujitsu into the wrestling. So that, and I say this all the time and, and dean will tell you the same thing. Dean will, a dean will hesitate to shoot on me because he knows there's significant threats there. He'll shoot all day on a good wrestler because he doesn't care what happens.

Speaker 2:          01:43:12       They're not going to, they're not going to catch him most likely. I mean, obviously I did Jujitsu wrestler, it's can happen, but, and I feel the same way. I'll shoot, I'll shoot all day on a, on a good wrestler cause I don't care. They're not going to catch me anything. And if they do, I'll be able to do the proper defense and escape it. But Dean, no. Like no, that's a real problem. Same with Andy. You shoot on Andy, you're, you know, it's like okay that can be problematic and not even just pay for it. You can lose right there. Yeah. Yeah. Andy and I have been a problem. Whoever shoots Lou, whoever shoots loses. Yeah. Cause we're both have good anti wrestling. So yeah, that's it. That's the pro. That's the solution there. You've got to figure out that the counter, the Kryptonite to the wrestling, right.

Speaker 2:          01:43:55       In whatever way. Cause that's not just, Oh yeah, just do that. That's not how it is. It, it's, but that's the direction. That's the solution. There's problems with that. Well there's not problems with that. One of the easiest ways is to be very, I guess this is a problem, is to be very non aggressive because if all you're trying to do is avoid getting taken down, you already are, are a lot harder to take down than if you're like, if I go in and start trying to take down a wrestler, they're going to put me on my ass because I'm trying to take them and they know their counters that much better than timings that much better. They hit the switch phone. I'll also, I'm down, you know, but if I'm just trying to avoid you, it's the same thing with somebody that's a really good striker.

Speaker 2:          01:44:39       If you're just, if your goal is to, if you start striking with the Stryker that's better than you, you are more likely to get knocked out. You're more Luton like to get hit because you're playing there. That's the point. You're playing their game and you don't want to play their game. Now what sucks about that, and it even happened to Tyron Woodley fight. It was a boring fight because it was shots getting stuffed. Stand up just a little. Some striking shots, getting stuffed, stand up to play, striking shots, getting stuff. That's what the fight was. It was a very boring fight because his goal is to not get taken down and he's a wrestler, so he had the capability of doing it and that was that. I'll tell you what it does, what you do for, for wrestling situation, one of the simple, it's not easy at all, but you find a way to get to the back from the bottle.

Speaker 2:          01:45:28       Well, yeah, that's great. Yeah. You find a way to submit mum, submit them. That's great to get to the, because depend told me them to their band, get on their back. So for sure on their back he was, he told me this when he was going to fight Chael Sonnen [inaudible] a [inaudible] and he was like, he was like, yeah, it's interesting. Fighting wrestlers or whatever. It's like they can provide like that. I'm totally paraphrasing. They can provide these really hard situations for you in Jujitsu for many reasons of super hard and hard people to fight. But if you can figure it out, you got to figure out ways where wrestling provides weaknesses in an in, in a Jujitsu scenario. Yeah. And then if you watch the match, sure enough, like he was [inaudible] was really good at stuffing stuff in stuffing, stuffing and then you could see golf.

Speaker 2:          01:46:16       I was like just slowly and then he got to the guts of the bat and I used to coach Dean with the same idea of do you know if he was going against a good wrestler? I'd say use your Jujitsu if he's going against, get good Jujitsu guy, guide, say use your wrestling. Dean would have a tendency because of his personality to want to go against them in their strength. So he tried out wrestle wrestlers. He tried out Jujitsu attributes, you guys? He would, he would, that's his natural tendency would be to go at people's strengths and I'd have to like say no, do Jujitsu against this guy and then he'd do it and get what he needed to get.

Speaker 2:          01:46:57       All right back to the book. When one is obliged to defend entrenchments, one should post all the battalions directly behind the parapet because if once the enemy sets foot upon that, those in the rear we'll think of nothing but to save themselves. This is because of the consternation in men when something happens that they have not expected. Again, conservation is shock, so he's again emphasizing the fact that when people aren't expecting something, it is a major down her for it's a major down for Macquarie. It interrupts what's happening and that's why you got to think of contingencies. That's one of the biggest things that, well, one of the best things about thinking about contingencies is just that you're aware of. It's going to have that you've thought about it for half a second big tip that makes you so much better off getting caught complete, getting caught completely off guard.

Speaker 2:          01:47:54       I mean this happens in Jujitsu. The thing that you get caught with is the thing that you didn't see coming. Yeah, that's, that's the thing that catches you. The thing that surprises you and you're like, how'd that happen? It surprise you. That's what you get caught with. Even like in your house? Like that's the one I think of a lot where you know when you're in your house and, and if you think of like what if there's someone in here? Oh yeah, right now you're not even necessarily of how scary that would be necessarily, but it's like, okay, what if there's someone in here, at least I'm ready for the fact that someone's in here, my daughter, my eight year old daughter will try and scare me. Yeah. And she'll hide somewhere and if I don't expect it, I get started get and then, and then what I do is I just, you know, you're talking about punishments?

Speaker 2:          01:48:40       No. What? I know I punished myself. So she's shows she scared me twice last year. Like that actually made me a little bit startled. She tried to 98 times 96 of them were ineffective, but I'll tell you what, I, I punished myself burpee school and then, but I really enjoy scaring people. It's sure a lot. I don't know why. I find it very entertaining and funny and satisfying. So I do, when I scare people, like makes them cry. Have you scare him? Do you do the like the loud noise one or do you think, yeah. You know, cause a lot of times the loud noise isn't the scary thing. Right. And sometimes the scratching at the window is a lot. Yeah. Sometimes you think you're home alone, you think your dad's calling and then all of a sudden there's like scratching at the window and then there's a noise of the door opening and you start calling out for your dad but he doesn't answer. And then there's more scratching at the window and then all of a sudden there's someone with a mask on the coating. You can do that. That's a violation. You can't do that with. But I do do that. Yeah. Yeah. So anyways,

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       that's that. Back to the book, he said, well let me catch us up to where we, we're talking about the shock that happens when people don't expect something back to the book. This is a general rule in war and decides all battles and all actions. It comes from the human heart and he's what induced me to compose this work. I do not believe that anyone yet has attempted to find their, find their the reasons for the poor success of armies. Thus, when you have stationed your troops behind a pair of put, they hope by their fire to prevent the enemy from passing the ditch and mounting it. If this happens in spite of the fire and they give themselves up for lost, lose their heads and fly, it would be much better to post a single rank. There aren't pikes whose business will be to push these st went back as fast as they attempt to mount, and certainly they will execute this duty because it is what they expect and what they prepared for. If with this, you post infantry formed according to my method into centuries, at a distance of 30 paces from the entrenchment, these troops will see that they are placed there to charge the enemy as fast as he enters and attempts to form. They will not be astonished to see the enemy enter because they expect it and we'll charge vigorously. Instead, if instead they had been placed on the parapet, they would have fled. That is how a trifle changes everything in war and how human weaknesses cannot be managed except by allowing for them.

Speaker 1:          01:51:26       That's, that's heavy right there. Human weaknesses cannot be managed. You have to allow for them. Think about that, that, you know, you have to do that all time as a leader, you have to, well you have to try and do it as a leader because if you don't try and manage these weaknesses, you, you, you don't allow for them, then they're going to, they're going to jam you up as you would say. So you've got somebody with a big ego, you, you to put, you gotta put them in a situation where that ego's gonna flourish and not be offended. And, and when it does get offended, you got to allow for that and how you're going to adapt to it. It's like expecting perfection, you know? You know, like if you expect perfection, yeah, well you're going to be let down a bunch. This is what I'm saying.

Speaker 1:          01:52:08       So if you allow for imperfection is going to, you can, you can just manage better. So there's two major points, you know, number one, if you set people up so that what they expect, what they expect to happen happens, they're going to have a better chance of achieving what it is you want them to achieve. Because if these guys are in the parapet and all of a sudden they get run upon and they're surprised by it and their mission was defend the pair of pit, well now they're, they're getting overrun. Whereas if you say no, once they pair up, it gets taken, you attack. Now they're, they know the parapets going, it's not going to be surprised them they expected to happen and then when they, they get the opportunity, they're going to get in there and get after it. But man, allowing the, the manage managing human weakness, Oh, you only way you can do this by allowing for it.

Speaker 1:          01:52:54       At least some measure of it. Yeah. Good. Good lesson learned. That's something you can think about as you lead people. You can think about, hey man, this is a little weakness here and if I don't allow for that, I don't give that some room and I count on, you know, uh, Flynn Flynn from echelon front, newest member of echelon front, but he just wrote an article about a guy, he was stationed on a ship before he got to the teams and he was saying this guy had been late for work and, but he was trying to bring the guy along. He had a lot of potential, blah, blah, blah. Anyways, they go to actually do a, uh, important training with their weapons on the ship that they were on. And the guy missed the ship leaving port and he says, you know, I should have fired the guy before this and now I'm out here.

Speaker 1:          01:53:45       I don't have this primary guy and he let down me and let down the ship and everything like that. But he didn't account for human weakness. He, you know, he fought that he could bring this guy along, but he just, you know, it's one of those things if you don't allow for that human weakness in there, you might be, you might be getting left high and dry, which is not good. That's on the made that thing on the echelon front webpage, which is called the platoon hut. And it was just like writing little, I guess it could be referred to as a blog. It's not really a blog or the blog to me seems a very, you know, just hey, we're going to write whatever blog. So this is, this is some little, I guess you might want to call them articles. Yeah. And there's like let like let little lessons.

Speaker 1:          01:54:29       Yeah, yeah, of course. Little lessons I, yeah, I liked, I didn't enjoy platoon hut the whole, the whole time. And the reason we call it a platoon hood is because that's where you'd sit around and talk shop. I guess we were talking about other things, but when you get back from a training op, because when you're overseas you, you still have a platoon hub, but it's not the platoon and I guess it is the platoon not, but anyways, yeah, even there. So when you get back from an operation, you'd come into debrief, debriefing you, you get done with the official debrief, but then you go into the platoon hood, Hey, you should do this. And so, yeah. So that's one of those, he as a young surface warfare officer in the Navy didn't allow for the human weakness of this young sailor and in costume going back to the book, the Greeks were very skillful in the art of war and well disciplined, but they're large Phalanx was never able to contend with the small bodies of Romans dis disposed in this formation.

Speaker 1:          01:55:29       Now he goes on to, there's a guy named [inaudible] and he goes on to quote a huge chunk of text from police because police was a Greek historian. And [inaudible] actually talked about why the Roman armies could defeat the failings and pretty interesting. So here's what he said. It is easy to demonstrate by many reasons that while the failings retains its proper form and full power of action, no force is able to stand against it in front or in support of the violent attack. So while the Phalanx is in order, you're not going to be able to defeat it. So the Phalanx is a military formation and he talks a little bit about what it's made up of here. When the ranks are closed in order to engage each shoulder as he stands with his arms, occupies a space of three feet. The spears in their ancient form, we're 17 cubits long.

Speaker 1:          01:56:32       A cubit is about 18 inches, but for the sake of rendering them more commodious and actions, they have since been reduced to 14 of these four cubits are contained between the part which the soldier grasps in his hands and the lower end of the spear behind which serves as a counterpoint to the part that is extended before him and when and the length of this last part from the body of the soldier. When the spear is pushed forwards with both hands against the enemy is in consequence 10 cubic cubits from. Hence it follows that when the Phalanx is closed and it's proper form, every soldier pressed within the necessary distance with respect to the man that has before him and on his side the spears of the fifth rank, our extended to the length of two cubits and those are the second, third and fourth two is still greater length beyond the formal strength.

Speaker 1:          01:57:26       It is manifest manifest then that several spears differing each other in the length of two cubits are extended before every man in the foremost rank and when it is considered likewise that the Phalanx is formed by 16 in depth, it will be easy to conceive what must be the weight and violence of the entire body and how great the force of its attack. So you got guys 16 people deep, 16 people deep and they've got these spears and they adjust the spears depending on where you are in the ranks. So the guy that's five ranks back still has a little bit of his spear sticking out. And by the way, if one of those guys goes down, there's another 14 people there ready to take his place. So the Phalanx was locked together. The shields protecting the person to your left and it's like a porcupine of death locked together and obviously the the Greeks were hardcore warriors and this is what they use and they use to crush people.

Speaker 1:          01:58:36       Would this Phalanx crush them? Spears and shields, that's all you see now plebe IOUs talks about what the Romans did and what their setup was. Back to the book to each of the Roman soldiers as he stands in arms, is a lot of the same space of three feet. But as every soldier in time of action is constantly in motion, being forced to shift this shield continuously so that he may cover any part of his body against which a stroke is aimed and to vary the position of his sword so as to either push or to make a falling stroke. There must be also a distance of three feet. The least that can be allowed for performing these motions with advantage between each soldier and the man that stands next to him, both on his side and behind him. So the Romans are in the same similar position, but they're moving individually inside these little positions so they're not working together.

Speaker 1:          01:59:31       They're, they're more mobile. It will be easy therefore to conceive that wall, the Phalanx retains its proper position and strengths. No troops, as I have before observed can, uh, support the attack of it in front. So if you're going to get the Phalanx, you're going to lose if you're going in front to what cause then is it described that the Roman armies are victorious and those defeated that employed the Phalanx. So how was it that the Romans were able to beat the failings? This is the cause in war. The Times and places of action are various and indefinite, but there is only one time and place one fixed and determined manner of action that is suited to the failings. In the case of a general action. If an enemy be forced to encounter with the failings in the very time and place, which the latter requires, it is probable in the highest degree that the failings must obtain victory.

Speaker 1:          02:00:34       So if you fight the Phalanx where the Phalanx wants you to fight it, meaning on a big open area, you're going to lose. But if it is possible to avoid an engagement in such circumstances, and it is indeed easy to do it, there is nothing to be dreaded from this order of battle. And here's where it gets to the nitty gritty. It is well known and acknowledged truth that the Phalanx requires a ground that is plain and naked and free from obstacles of every kind such as trenches, breaks and browse of hills or the channels of rivers, and that any of these are sufficient to impede it and to dissolve it the unto dissolve the order in which it was formed. If the enemy coming down down on it should lead their army through the country, plundering the cities in ravaging the lands of what use, then we'll be the Phalanx.

Speaker 1:          02:01:28       So all you have to do is get them on some rough terrain. You get them on some rough terrain and that Phalanx, I mean it's, it's hard to march already. We know that, but now we're marching against weird terrain and the guy in front of you trips and falls while heat. What does he hit? He hits a rock and how that makes this guy fall and all of a sudden we got a big disaster on our hands back to the book. When the Romans attacked the failings in the front, they never employ all their forces so as to make their line equal to that of the enemy, but lead on only a part of their troops and the rest they keep in reserve. Now, whether the troops, the Phalanx break the line that is opposed to them or whether they are broken themselves, the formation peculiar to the Phalanx is alike dissolved. So even if they win that initial onslaught, even if the Phalanx wins, that the Phalanx is out of order.

Speaker 3:          02:02:17       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          02:02:19       If they pursue the fugitive or if on the other hand they retreat and our pursued, in either case they're separated from the rest of their own body and thus there is left some space which the reserve of the Roman army takes care to seize and then charges the remaining part of the Phalanx. But the charge is not made against the front but in the flank or the rear. Since it is easy then to avoid the conditions that are favorable to the Phalanx and since those on the contrary that are disadvantaged, disadvantageous to it can never be avoided. It is certain that this difference alone must carry with it a decisive wait in time of action. So let them get a little bit disrupted once they're disrupted, flank them.

Speaker 3:          02:03:01       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          02:03:04       The troops of the Phalanx lose all their strength when they engage in separate companies or man on man. The Roman order on the contrary has never attended even on such occasions with any disadvantage among the Romans. Every single soldier when he is once armed and ready for service is a like fitted and engaged, fitted to engage in any time or place on any appearance of the enemy and preserves the always the same power and the same capacity in action, whether in separate companies or man to man. So big destructive element in front of you. Don't go head on head with it. We've learned this over and over again. You might want to distract it. Sure, but then you hit him from the flank and don't face people on their best category, right? Don't wrestle against the rest of their, don't you just threw against the Jujitsu guy. Don't box against the boxer. Don't go at them and don't do it where they want to do it. That's a real important, disrupting the Phalanx.

Speaker 3:          02:04:10       [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          02:04:14       Now we talks about attacking entrenchments, which again, these are defensive positions. When an entrenchment is to be attacked, an attempt should be made to extend the lines as much as possible. Makes Sense, right? I just don't want to, I want to let make the person think that we're going to tack them on the whole, the whole line that he's got. This will make the enemy fearful everywhere so that he will not withdraw troops from any point to reinforce that what you intend to attack. Even after he discovers it, this makes many of his troops. Uselessness was d day, so what we did on d day, you know, they did those massive deception operations. The Brits, the Americans have built those fake tanks and fake planes and put them all there. They were inflatable. You've seen that stuff right there. You seeing that? Oh yeah. The Americans and the Brits. When we were trying to to confuse Hitler about where we were going to attack d day, they made these, we made like fake airplanes and fake tanks and they put them in different locations that indicated that we'd probably be attack in this spot instead of that spot and it all works and so he had to defend the whole line. He actually defended those areas where they fought. The attack was coming more than they defended the area or d day was cool. Little deception operation. No.

Speaker 5:          02:05:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:05:31       Back to the book. Too much attention cannot be paid, despise and guides. They are like eyes and are equally necessary to a gen general. He is uh, too much money cannot be spent to get good ones. These men should be chosen in the country where the war is being fought. They should be intelligent. Cloning and discreet spies.

Speaker 5:          02:05:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:05:59       The commanding general, I have formed a picture of a commanding general, which is not CIM miracle. I have seen such men. The first qualities, the first of all qualities is courage. Without this, the others are of little value since they cannot be used. The second is intelligence, which must be strong and fertile in expedience. The third is health. He should possess a talent for sudden and appropriate improvisation. That's a good, you don't expect that a talent for sudden and appropriate improv improvisation. If I didn't make this clear enough, he's kind of going through the characteristics that he believes a good commanding general should have. He should be able to penetrate the minds of other men while remaining impenetrable himself.

Speaker 1:          02:06:54       He should be endowed with a capacity of being prepared for everything with the activity, with activity, companied by judgment, with the skill to make proper decision on all occasions and with exactness of discernment, good lists. He should have a good disposition, free from from caprice, and be a stranger to hatred and caprices like you're just going to change your mind all the time. He should punish without mercy, especially those core dearest to him, but never from anger. Okay. You remember earlier he was talking about be kind of chill with it, with the lashings, but he says you should punish without mercy, especially those who are dearest to you. And I think that goes to what you were saying about troops. Hey, you're going to draft people. You've got to make sure you draft the rich people too. And I think you saying you've got to treat people fairly, right, even when you're, even when it's in your voice. Yeah. He should always be grieved when he is forced to execute the military rules and should have the example of moneyless constantly before his eyes and Manlius actually actually Manlius he was like a Roman a hero during, during the Golic siege and he, but beyond that, he was sort of like a, I want to call my human rights advocate, but maybe that's too strong of a word. But anyways, he ended up getting a crucified, not crucified, thrown from him,

Speaker 3:          02:08:37       okay.

Speaker 1:          02:08:37       From, from a great height and killed as Zach execution. But he's sort of seen as a guy that stood up. He almost was in like an Alamo scenario, like in Texas when the, when they, when they stood and were killed, he was in one of those situations, but he wasn't killed during that galaxy. Jerome. Anyways, back to the book, Kesha Discard the idea of that is he who punishes and should persuade himself and others that he only administers the military laws

Speaker 1:          02:09:06       with these qualities, you'll be loved. He will be feared and without doubt obeyed the functions of a general are infinite. He must know how to subsist his army. And how to husband it, how to place it so that it will not be forced upon to fight, except when he chooses how to form his troops in an infinity of different infinity of different dispositions, how to profit from that favorable moment which occurs in all battles and which decides their success. All these things are of immense importance and are as varied as the situations and dispositions which produced them.

Speaker 3:          02:09:50       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:09:51       In order to see all these things, the general should be occupied with nothing else. The day of the battle, the inspection of the terrain and the disposition of his troops should be prompt like the flight of an eagle. This done, his orders should be short and simple as for instance, the first line of attack, the first line will attack and the second will be in support. Boom. That's it. Keep it simple. The generals under his command must be in competent indeed if they do not know how to execute this order and to perform the proper maneuvers with their respective divisions. Thus the commander in chief will not be forced to occupy with it nor be embarrassed with the details. For a fee temps to be a battle sergeant and be everywhere himself. He will resemble the fly in the fable that thought he was driving the coach with us on the day of the battle.

Speaker 1:          02:10:52       I should want the general to do nothing. His observations will be better for it. His judgment will be more sane and he will be in a better state to profit from the situations in which the enemy finds himself during the engagement. And when he sees an occasion, he should unleashes energies, hasten to the critical point at top speed sees the first troops available, advanced them rapidly, and lead them in person. These are the strokes that decide battles or and gain victories. The important thing is to see the opportunity and know how to use it. So what are you saying? There's got to be detached. Hmm. He's saying you got to be detached and then you've got to stay back or you've got to look around. Now he also says, once you see the critical moment, you've got to get up in there and make it happen.

Speaker 3:          02:11:40       Okay?

Speaker 1:          02:11:41       But he's saying, you definitely can't get laid down in the weeds. You can't be the sergeant that's trying to do everything

Speaker 1:          02:11:48       back to the book. Many commanding generals only spend their time on the day of the battle and making their troops march in a straight line in seeing that they keep their proper distances in answering questions, which their aids the camp come to ask in sending them hither and thither and in running about incessantly themselves. In short, they try to do everything and as a result do nothing. So this is a great, this is just, you're in a leadership position, you try and do everything yourself. You're not going to do anything at all. Then it's the same. That's the same thing as prioritized. Next, give me, if you try and solve all the problems that are happening at the same time, you're not going to solve any of those problems. Hmm.

Speaker 3:          02:12:27       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:12:28       They appear to me like men with their heads turned who no longer see anything and who are only able to do what they have done all their lives, which is to conduct troops methodically under their orders up under the orders of a commander. How does this happen? It is because very few men occupy themselves with the higher problems of war. They pass their lives drilling troops, and believe that this is the only branch of the military act. When they arrive at the command of armies, they are totally ignorant and in default of knowing what should be done, they do what they know. That is so classic. It's so classic. When people don't know, they don't understand something, they do what they know how to do. They they always default into what they know how to do. Hmm. Their minds are closed. One of the branches of the art of war, that is to say drill and the method of fighting is the other is intellectual for the conduct of the ladder, it is essential that ordinary, ordinary men should not be chosen.

Speaker 3:          02:13:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:13:42       Unless a man is born with a talent for war, you will never be on other than a mediocre general is the same with all talents in painting or music or in poetry. The talent must be inherent for excellence. All sublime arts are alike in this respect. That is why we see so few outstanding men in science centuries past without producing one application rectifies ideas, but does not furnish us soul for that as the work of nature. You know, I just answered a question on Twitter. I think it was, um, and I basically said, well, you know, you can't do whatever you want.

Speaker 3:          02:14:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:14:29       Just because you believe in it and you have hard work and discipline like that, that doesn't mean you can do whatever you want like as a career or something. Yeah. Like, and I always use the example like I couldn't be on the Olympic, let's say an Olympic weightlifter or the, in fact, I don't know that there's any Olympic sport that I would be, that I have the, um, genetic makeup to be able to, to be able to compete at the Olympic level. I, of course we could go back and maybe that's possible from a child, but I don't feel like it. But even right now w you know, if you take that to the extreme, that means, hey, you know what? If I have the focus and I have five, the discipline, I can become an Olympic wrestler now. High Jumper, Olympic high jumper, right. How's that vert looking?

Speaker 1:          02:15:18       So you see what I'm saying now my opinion is that is not true. And some people are not going to achieve certain things that they may want to achieve no matter how hard they want to do it. And I, you know, most people are like, yeah, that's a realistic. Some people were like, no, you can, if you believe that you can achieve it. It's like if I could believe it, if I could achieve it because I believed it, dude, I'd be like, I'd be, I'd be, I'll just all winning. Sure. Everything. Sure. It's not that easy. Yeah, you got to believe it. You got to work hard at it. You got to have some natural capabilities. So the way it is, I'm sorry to let everyone down. What was your line? Is One of those lines that you can kind of take with, you said belief something odd. Is it? So you said it, it belief is not going to make anything happen, but at the same time without belief, nothing's going to happen. Totally true. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, you've got absolutely. So yes, belief by itself won't make anything happen that, you know, some people sit around, I believe I can do this, so I'm going to achieve,

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       no, no, no. You want to achieve, you've got to do something. Yeah. And the same token that is also correct is that if you don't believe in what you're doing, then yeah, there's no way you're going to achieve it. You won't be able to gut through it when it gets problematic, which it's certainly going to, so sacs agrees with me that hey, the work of nature, it has to be in play. Otherwise it's not happening. You might get to some level, but yeah, reality is

Speaker 4:          02:16:58       the thought. I think that's a hard one to admit you. You don't seem like you want to admit this. I think you're over there like you. If you wanted to go the distance, put it this way, it seems really like that's not true. It seems like you know, you maybe you just didn't work hard enough even though you thought that you worked as hard as he possibly can and maybe the fact that this is what it seems like, but at the end of the day, I do agree with that. I mean it's, it's way clear with physical stuff. Physical limitations are way more obvious and there's, yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:17:27       there's, I don't know. Well, let's face it. Let's say playing guitar because I play guitar and I also now kind of play Ukulele. Yeah, but let's say playing guitar, even if you practice and you can mechanically play guitar, that doesn't give you the natural spark of creativity that is demanded. If it did, then every person that worked hard and play guitar would become a rock and roll star with great creative songs, but it just doesn't happen. Yeah. There's hundreds of thousands just in America. There's hundreds of thousands of people that play guitar. At a incredibly capable proficiency. Right? They can play every song that you hear on the radio, but you know what they do for a living cover cover songs. Will they play cover songs? They're also working as a banker somewhere because they didn't have whatever creative thing that would give them to be able to create something that was new in that people want and ruin and listen to that, that needs to come from somewhere else in practice isn't gonna get you there. Some people learn it in the schools, some people learn it on the streets, but I think you kinda gotta be born with it, man. And that's a little tenacious d for everyone.

Speaker 4:          02:18:41       Yeah. Yeah. And again, like can you teach creativity? And even then it's like, yeah, but now, yeah, really. Exactly. I mean, compared to the diagnosis and then where do you get it really? You know, it's uh, yeah, it's weird. It's just, I think that's really the reason that it is true is because you can't put your finger on it. You can't be like, yeah, just work as hard as you possibly can. Sure. That's going to improve your other

Speaker 2:          02:19:07       classic example is look at the people. You know what if I go to an academic, a high level academic environment where everyone is, you know, incredibly intelligent, but not all of them are able to do something that not all, all of them are able to succeed at the level that their, that their heritage would point towards. So just because you got a 1600 on your sats and you did this and you went to this great college, there's a lot of people that did all those things and they're, they're not what they themselves would consider a successful. Right. And so the reality is there's something not there. And like you said, I don't know that you can actually put your finger on it because there's some other kid that didn't do any of that and made stuff happen and was extremely successful. There's thousands and thousands of examples like that too.

Speaker 2:          02:20:08       So it's Kinda like when you compare it like the proverbial person with all the potential versus someone with not that much potential. And maybe the guy with the, with Le less potential, there'll be exceptions where that guy made it. And then there'll be obviously like all these other scenarios where the guy with the potential doesn't, doesn't make it. So it's like, all right know this guy's born with it. What kind of, let's take it to a new level, not just making it, but actually being a, the highest level for that person. You got to have the talent and you got to have the work. You gotta do both tends to be the case check.

Speaker 2:          02:20:49       And he says the same thing here. I've seen very good colonels become very bad generals. I have known others who were great takers of villages, excellent for maneuvers within an army, but who, outside of that, we're not even able to lead a thousand men in war who lost their heads completely and now we're unable to make a decision, any decision. So he sees the same thing. And, and you know, I see that with business leaders, the business leader that you need to be the, at the beginning of your business is not the same business leader that you need to be. Once your business is more successful, you got to have this. Some guys are good at street fighting, right? They're good at street fighting. They're not good at planning a war, planning a campaign, and so you might win as a company. If you're a leader at the street fighting level and you do good, you scrap it out. Then as you grow, if you don't transition mentally and become a different kind of leader, not a different person, but a different kind of leader, you may not be able to win at the higher levels. So that needs to get paid attention to back to the book one should once and for all established establish a standard combat procedures which the troops as well as the general who leads them. No,

Speaker 2:          02:22:11       I'm not the first person to talk about standard operating procedures at all. These are general rules such as preserving proper distances on the march when charging to charge vigorously to fill up intervals in the first line from the second no instructions

Speaker 1:          02:22:25       are required for this. It is the a B, c of the troops and nothing is simpler standard operating procedures. He also says that the general should preserve an unfettered mind and not occupy himself with trifles. I am convinced that a skillful general could make war all his life without being forced into one. That's the old, the real martial artist doesn't have to fight the art of fighting without fighting. This war can be made without leaving anything to chance. And this has, and this is the highest point of perfection and skill as a general,

Speaker 1:          02:23:18       so he now are there things that are left to chance in war? Yeah, there's a lot of things that are left to chance and warp, but can you mitigate a lot of those? Yeah, absolutely. Back to book. The words of the proverb, a bridge of gold should be made for the enemy is followed religiously. Meaning I'm going to give, if the enemy wants to run, I'm going to build them a bridge. A goal to run on. No, not you want to run away. That's great. Warren is over. This is false. On the contrary, the pursuit should be pushed to the limit and the retreat which had appeared such a satisfactory solution will be turned into a route. A detachment of 10,000 men can destroy an army of 100,000 in flight. Nothing inspires so much terror or occasions. So much damage for everything is lost. So he's saying, no, you don't let the enemy get away when they're running. That's when you destroy them completely.

Speaker 1:          02:24:24       This is not to say that it is necessary to give yourself up totally to the pursuit and fall the enemy with all your forces, but if the officer you have ordered in pursuit prides himself upon the regularity of his formation and the precautions of his march, there is no use in having sent him. He must attack, push and pursue without cease. All maneuvers are good, then it is only precautions that are worthless. A yeah. And that right there kind of wraps up the highlights of this book attack, Push, pursue without ceasing. And I believe that is also known as getting after it. It. What's interesting is I think it's clear that as we continue to see these leaders throughout history that we're able to lead through the harshest of conditions. There's obviously a lot of common principles that they share in. So the question is, okay, why do we keep breeding them? Hmm, why do I keep trying to confirm the same things? Why am I always looking actually for counterpoints as well that offers some kind of different solution? Like the one about Sun Tzu today, no need to be early on the battlefield. If it's cold out there and it's going to wear down your troops don't be early.

Speaker 3:          02:25:58       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          02:26:00       But from my perspective, the more different angles that you see these things, the scene, the, the, the more different ways that you learn the same lesson, the more clearly you understand if you learn an arm lock from three different people, they're all going to give you something different. And it's the same thing. We get something slightly different from all these strategic thinkers.

Speaker 3:          02:26:23       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:26:24       And we get better understanding of it. And there are differences in what people say.

Speaker 3:          02:26:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:26:34       And I think it's good to look at the way those differences manifest themselves on the battlefield and throughout history, because maybe there's one solution that's a little bit better than the one that I know right now. So for me, I'm going to continually try to reinforce, try and fortify, try and stay humble as sacs talked about, continue to learn and relearn and discard what doesn't work. And always try and get better.

Speaker 3:          02:27:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:27:12       And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

Speaker 1:          02:27:18       Yeah, I guess it better be. I thought this was going to be a quick episode. All good. All right. I guess we should move quickly now. What do you think? Do you agree with me or no, it doesn't sound like it. We'll see what up. So getting better. Yeah. Speaking of getting better duck wisdom supplements, they're Jocko supplements. We know you're going to get better. And I, there's the case, so Super Krill, the Krill oil supplements, good one super and joint warfare and disciplined castle. Let's say those three songs. If anyone's wondering if you're watching on youtube and you're seeing me drink two things, I'll drinking two things. One of them is it a smart water bottle and it is. I'm drinking discipline. The other is in a Poland spring bottle that I brought back from Maine to remind me of Maine and I'm drinking that one Jocko white tea. So it was vital to be in New York to put away, every, all in the northeast will say, yeah, yeah, but you won't get, you won't find Poland spring out here.

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       No, no. That's when he brought it back. Just don't nonetheless. So the Super Krill Krill oil better than fish oil factually, factually. And then there's Jocko Super Krill, which is better than regular Krill oil factually. And then there's, there's, there's people out there not taking Krill oil and I'm not saying they should take real oil. They should take krill oil. That's not what I'm saying right now. I am saying if I will argue, I'll actually

Speaker 2:          02:28:54       pretty much guarantee pretty much, I know that defeats the purpose of a guarantee, but I'll pretty much guarantee that if someone's not taking Krill oil, whether you Jocko crew horror or not and they take krill oil, there'll be like, Dang, I should have started taking this krill oil before. Is it like learning Jiu Jitsu when you started you just, you go man, I should have said I wish I started this when I was 13 it's just like that on a smaller level, on a joint maintenance level, joint warfare is what I'm feeling is for me that's kind of, it's new. Right. You know and I'm like man I wish I can get this for a long wait. The joint warfare. Yeah, cause you can feel, it's like you're getting maintenance. Well you should've came up with it earlier. I know, I know. Next time that's what you're going to do. You can come up with it earlier. That's what I think you should do nonetheless, there for your joints. It's a good and we're all working out. They were making something. We're making a new product, we'll say sure. And it is

Speaker 3:          02:29:54       okay.

Speaker 2:          02:29:55       It's going to be good. You're going to like it. It's, it's a, it's a protein drink and it's going to be, oh it's, I've had, we've done two samplings given the ingredient. So we give the ingredients to the supplement factory, they mix them and we've gone through to the F two we've gone through two iterations. The first iteration I was like, oh my God, this tastes good. Wait, wait, what? Talking pure taste or taste? The first one I was like all this, this, this tastes good. Really good. Like the kind where you think this is a whole new thing, you know what I mean? Wait. Yeah cause yeah cause protein, tea tastes like protein powders. That crap. Yeah. And that was one of the things we research to figure out how we could make it taste legit. Good. Where you were not, you're holding your nose enforcement down between the first sample that we got, which I was in Maine when we tasted it.

Speaker 2:          02:30:59       We stood there with me, Brian and Pete and we were standing there and we, we all mixed it up together and import it into three separate cups. Sure. Anne and everyone, when we drank it, everyone's like quiet for a second. They did. It was, oh my God, look what time is it? Well this one was meant chocolate and, and, and it's just really good and obviously the protein and is awesome and we've got some other things in it that are going to make it more complete. But yeah. And then I just got the sec, but you know, there was a couple of adjustments that I wanted to make to the taste. Just the pure taste. Yeah. So we just made those adjustments. I got the second iteration and it tastes even better than the first one, but I still, I've sent them back for one more, but hopefully to only be one more iteration before we can start producing.

Speaker 2:          02:31:46       It's going not going to come out for awhile. Uh, it takes a long time to get everything rolling. But yeah. Anyways, we have that in the future. That's interesting cause I don't, I'm not into protein powder. You will be there is this one I'm telling you you will be moved for protein. It'll be for like a dessert. It'll be like someone saying they're not into. This is going to be like someone saying I'm not into ice cream. That's how tasty it is. Good. I guess we'll see. I guess that's kind of the test in a way. In a way to test. Well good. Nonetheless. Krill oil, joint warfare and discipline. Those are already out. Yup. Doing work discipline tastes good too. That's another thing. You don't have to drink something that tastes like crap just because it's awesome for you. You can do something that tastes good and I'll tell you one thing I've noticed, and I don't know if this is, I don't know what this means, but when I drink discipline cause I work out in the morning, as I say all the time, I don't do a pre workout thing.

Speaker 2:          02:32:43       It's not my thing. Right. I work, I work out in the morning on an empty stomach and there was this old rock climber and I can't think of his name right now, one of the famous old rock climbers. And he would, I read an article one time about him where he was, he would climb while starving himself and wearing a weight belt who was harder. And I was like, yeah, but if do that, I've done that all the time. Don't ever since anyways the D if you have some discipline the drink, then you will feel like, so when I got done working out maybe like let's say, you know, I always say, oh, I usually have some nuts around mixed nuts just to kind of get in my gut a little food. I've been, I've been having some some, you know, a couple handfuls of mixed nuts and then having some discipline and I still feel so light.

Speaker 2:          02:33:32       Super good that then I'm just firing through the day. And so basically what I'm getting at is this is I've been eating even cleaner because I'm eating like I'm eating basically right now. I think I'm eating a once a day meeting, discipline, drink, it's discipline. And then I'm going once a day with a good solid meal. And then yeah, it's man, it's good. It's good stuff and that's good. And that works for you. It was working good for it because I'll tell you why. When I eat less, I feel better. When I eat less, I feel better. And so this is making me eat less now. I'm not saying now, believe me, when I eat dude, I get it on. That's how I roll. When I eat, I get it on. And, but this is just, yeah, it's nice to be able to get to feel energized and sharp mentally without getting crazy.

Speaker 2:          02:34:23       Um, think that, cause you know that idea that when you eat less than you feel better. And I found that to be the case and this is what I realized. I found that to be the case only sometimes. And I was thinking, why is it like that? Sometimes if I'm doing something like, you know when we go to the muster or something like that, I'll for sure FTX I were doing something all day and I wasn't eating. Yes, but if you eat, it's kind of like your body goes into this like kind of wrestled for sure. But if you eat a little bit or like just, you know, just like going to stand at all, it's time to eat. Oh, could we, could we cruising now you in your body, you're basically telling yourself you're going into level seven, echo cruisey recruiters technically recover mode.

Speaker 2:          02:35:06       It's really kind of what it does and that's really what it felt like. So yeah, I found that that, yeah. So you probably have a bunch of stuff to do. Oh, all the time. But when I'm for sure, when you're like, when I'm doing a fast, I want to be doing something. Yeah. You sit around and think about food yet horrible. You feel like? Like when Charlie plumb was talking about being at the Hanoi Hilton and he's just thinking, they were just literally sitting around thinking about food all the time because there wasn't even anything to do. Yeah. And eating food is actually a little bit of a cure or relief from boredom. You're, you know how when you're a kid you're just bored. You look in the fridge, you're not hungry, you're bored. Yeah, exactly. It's funny because right now I got my, you know my, it's wrestling season.

Speaker 2:          02:35:50       So the, the weight cuts are on and they're not, neither one of my kids that are resting are cutting a bunch of weight. But it means that you don't, you're, it means that there's times when you don't eat for a day right. Thing. So you get to see the effects of that. And my daughter's like, oh, I feel, she's like, yeah, I feel fine. She's just to get hangry or nothing. Yeah. She doesn't get hangry. I warned my wife, I said, hey, you need to watch out cause it won't people cause you when you're cutting weight with fighters they're cutting much more severe weight and they start getting in bad moods. Oh fighters. They start getting in bad moods cause they can't eat. They get hangry. Yeah but neither one of my kids are cutting that much weight. They're just kind of maintaining through the season.

Speaker 2:          02:36:29       Dude, I dunno if we talked about hangry like that's a for real thing because this is what it is. When you, when you, I mean Bilat physiologically your frontal cortex or the prefrontal frontal, I dunno, whatever the front of your brain, the part that's a scientist makes decisions. Oh an empathy and like all these things get compromised one year when you're, what hungry. I'll come on man. Listen to me because I believe that if you, if if he made all those things less effective than we wouldn't be here as a species. Cause every time we got hungry in the past we would have gotten all confused and frustrated and we are going to be able to duck hunt. But the bottom line is the opposite, I think is true. Back in the dairy, if needed a hunt something down, you had to be sharp. So when you didn't eat it made you sharper and more attuned. That's how I feel. Okay. That's not what, you know what I read and heard, but hey, I'm not saying that word that you can go on the Internet and find an r two scientific articles that say the exact opposite.

Speaker 4:          02:37:30       Just follow me. So hangry from what I read. Correct. Well, they didn't use the word hangry, but empathy. And this is with like if you get hungry or I'm sleep deprived, whatever. Yeah, just a part of your brain kind of. It doesn't shut down completely. It just yesterday, yesterday I went to sleep. I went to bed. Sure.

Speaker 2:          02:37:56       Eight 30 at night. Hey, yeah, I woke up at like three 50 and I was Kinda, I was like, Dang, that felt good. Yeah, I was, but I didn't sleep almost at all the night before. So I was recovering. I needed to put some more back in the bank. And everyone says you can't do that. You can't catch up on sleep. I just did it. Yeah. I don't know. Just did I caught up on sleep. I never let your finisher, your scientific explanation. So what was the deal? It just pre frontal cortex or whatever

Speaker 4:          02:38:25       the um, so you know, you'll treat people were technically, um, so yeah, hangry. That's apparently

Speaker 2:          02:38:33       roof from what I read is, is it an actual thing? Maybe not. So maybe I'm sure. Aggression, aggression, maybe it does make you sharpen when you're sharper, you're not taking any crap from anybody, so you're more aggressive towards them because you want to go out and hunt and kill something. Maybe. I do agree with you. Weird Science. Say Tomato. I say tomato. You know, you'd be aggressive, but nonetheless,

Speaker 4:          02:38:49       um, yeah, it's a real thing apparently. Okay. Who knows? I don't know. Not to say that everyone's going to behave in a certain way. I'm just saying that's what happens internally. Maybe. Maybe not nonetheless get disciplined. It'll cognitively enhance lift your prefrontal or frontal cortex. I forget. We just, both of them both though Acre frontal thing in your brain is shutting down. Boom. Take that discipline. The cognitive enhancers is going to help it out a lot. Don't be hangry even if you're hungry. Guess where you can get these things@originmean.com it's a lot of cool stuff on there or Jen Maine also has geese.

Speaker 3:          02:39:26       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:39:26       rash guards, various clothing items all made in America. That's a good spot. Just check it out. Look on there. It's a lot of cool stuff on there. If you want something, get something. Also, if you're into workout equipment to populate your home gym, it's good having a home gym. By the way. One of my friends is coming into town and he's like, yeah, let's catch a workout. I'm like, we don't have to go to a gym and catch work. I work at at home to do something else. Nonetheless, it made me think of how good it is to have a home gym. Nonetheless, if you have your home gym, you want to populate it even a little bit. Get your workout stuff from on it. That's what I think it's the cool one. You can do various interesting workout routines with the equipment. Unlike Jocko Jocko,

Speaker 2:          02:40:15       his workouts are super boring. Even though you do have kettle bells, which I respect. Yeah, and anything you want to add on that? No Man, that's it. Are you sure if that was the workout? The kettlebell, you're good, you're good, you're solid and I'm sure you're getting very strong and I'm sure you know in case everyone doesn't know and and running his mouth, and I use that term like with, I'm not just throwing it out there are really was running my mouth and you're really pissed off that you have a what? How much is your heaviest? Kettlebells? 90 90 95 foot boom. And my heaviest kettle bell was 88 pounds. This is no longer a problem. Now my heaviest kettle bells, plural, because I have to do is 48 kilograms or 106 pounds commonly referred to as the beast. So nonetheless minor from audit. They're the cool ones.

Speaker 2:          02:41:12       And you can get other cool exercise stuff. They're still go on it.com/jocko check all this stuff there. Do you want to get something? Also, when you get your copy of reveries on the art of war by Maurice, it's a good one. I like those manual kind ones. You know the one that goes, I know is, if you think about it, there's really three types of podcasts that are happening. One is a to is manual strategies about war. Three is human nature inside war. So those are kind of, when I'm reading a book I'm like, Oh yeah, I just kind of like one of those. Yeah. Yeah. So this would be with Napoleon's maxims or something like that. The Art of war by Sun Tzu. So we've done quite a number of books like that and you know, I get a little something different from each of them because if you think about it, he says that you have to pay attention to the human heart.

Speaker 2:          02:42:15       Well, where are you going to learn about the human heart? And he didn't say much about it. As much as he said you need to know about it. He didn't say much about it. Where are you going to find it? You're gonna find it by reading people that were actually in war and start to understand where their heart was in this whole gig. Yeah. It's interesting too because they're laid out in these specific contexts, you know, like, um, like Sun Tzu that he's, he's talking about, you know, a certain time period, a certain place, and then Vietnam one and then a world war and they're still, they're talking about, okay, these principles at this time and this is why they work well, it was interesting to do I drang and how more because it was his battle to podcasts on his battle and then his book that he wrote about leadership.

Speaker 2:          02:42:56       So you kinda got to see maybe, I don't know, I don't know if there's anything now we've seen some of that when for instance, you got Napoleon's maxims, right? And then we got to hear from a Napoleonic foot soldier. So you get to kind of see, see the, what the world was like, what the human heart was, was going on with the human heart, and then what was going on with the minds of the stratus Titian or even know if that's a word. It's tragic. Sure. I think so. Just be kicked. You know what's cool is the English language, you can words vague, vague, vague. They come about, you just get formed. Yeah. That's a catch. There's a time where there was no word and that word is there yet. If you look at the OED, which is the Oxford English dictionary, it tells you where the f w, w word came from and then it has like first usages.

Speaker 2:          02:43:46       So there's some words. This word is this for this word was first in print in 1622 in this work of art or this work of literature. Yeah. It's crazy to like words. We'll go in these cycles where there'll be used like eight, right? If you say ain't, that's a game. That's an improper thing. It's not really a word level by ain't was actually used by like high upper class people back in the day, like long time ago and like ain't and Shan't and all these like words like I Shit, you know, all this. And eight was one of them. There's one home and I forget the deal, but someone in the lower class started using it and they're like, oh, they're using it now, or something like that. So it went out and now it's like, oh, that's not a word that it is a word, the ink, the language in general.

Speaker 2:          02:44:35       But definitely the English language. I studied English in college and, but the, the classes that I took, some of the classes that I took where I would focus on that, which was pretty, which is always very interesting to me. Very interesting to me. And I think the reasons it's interesting to me is because language is how we communicate. Communication is how we lead. So if you don't know what words you're using or you can't find the right word to articulate what it is you're trying to say, you're gonna have a harder time getting your message across. When you have a harder time getting your message across, it's harder for you to lead. Yeah. So, and then if you kind of look at the big picture of that, it's kind of like you have been, then you kind of in a way should know slang and stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          02:45:20       For sure, for sure is if you're over here talking to quote unquote all proper to people who aren't used to hearing sure property, they can be like, what's this guy talking about? Or whatever. That is definitely true. And it's not just about language there, it's about culture as well. And, and you know, one of the cool things that when I grew up and I was kind of, you know, getting into the heart and I was in the hardcore scene, right? It exposed me to people and things that I wouldn't have seen if I would've stayed in my small, New England town. So when I got to the world, meaning got out of that small town in an hour, I was in the military, I was able to understand better than I would have if I didn't. Yeah. And I think that's important. Yeah. Yeah, it helps for sure. You have, okay. How's this word? Irregardless. Right ear regardless.

Speaker 4:          02:46:10       It's not even a word, right. That's what they said. So I had this bet, this is a long time. It was like over 10 years ago. I just bet cause coworker of mine and I, for whatever, I think my dad taught me like, you're a girl, this is not a work, you know, and he'd always like correct to you so you don't have any imprints in your mind. Like someone uses the word irreguardless, they should be corrected. That was kind of imprinted in my subconscious. So it happened at work, Charles Grammar Nazis for a little bit. It was more just, that was fun. But nonetheless, he, um, no, she was a girl, I said in regardless and word and she was like, yeah, it is. I was like, no, Irregardless is like a misuse, misuse of a word. Is that regardless, regardless, Irregardless is a misuse of war.

Speaker 4:          02:46:57       It's not a word. She was like, well, if it's a, if it's a word, if it's a misuse of a word, it's the word for the misuse of this specific word. And I'm like, it's not a word that hell did that just mean she's saying. She's saying basically if you can say it and you can spell it and it's like if it's a little name for something, it's not the name of anything. Name for a misuse of a word is what? That was her argument. That's what I, that's what I was saying. Did you win money? No, I did not win the myself money. No. So we're, we, it never got resolved between me and her. We hated it. I think we kind of hated each other. I would cause it got heated. We actually didn't hate each other. It was cool. But nonetheless, that was her stance.

Speaker 4:          02:47:34       My stance is you can't just invent a word. You can't just use a word wrong, invent another word because you're wrong. And then be like, oh, now it's a word, now I'm right. All of a sudden you can't do this. Not how it works. And then, so I look it up in the dictionary. Yeah. It was haunting me. So when I went over, I looked it up in the diction. Sure enough, the thing was there and it said the misuse of the, or the common misuse of regardless. So I'm, but I'm still confused. Like is that a word? And here's the thing, I talked to Jane about it. Yeah. It bothered me a lot. Yeah. So I talked to jade about it and he was like, Bro, that's kind of how the language is getting enough people misusing regardless, saying Eric Irregardless list, boom. All of a sudden he gets shuffled right into the rotation as a legitimate words.

Speaker 4:          02:48:16       What is that a good thing or is that a bad day? It's a beautiful thing. It's a beautiful thing. It is. Language is always evolving and that's what allows the language. Just like, just like Jujitsu, just like a mixed martial arts. You want it to evolve. You want it to new words to come out that can articulate something a little bit better. He's like, for instance, it regardless articulates its, you don't have the English language very well, but, but yeah, at some point a hundred years in the future, regardless will become a word that has a little bit of a different meaning than regardless. Like it's maybe it's more regardless ear, regardless of what you're saying. And it will say first used in the, you know, somebody is gonna write an article in online or, and it's going to, the guy's going to misuse it, but everyone's gonna understand it and it's gonna say first used here.

Speaker 4:          02:49:08       Yeah. There's all kinds of arguments you can have about language, but you have to remember that it's evolving all the time. Our languages are evolving all the time and it should, in France, they try not to let their language evolve. Yeah. The try and keep that language since you're seeing, or the ultimate result is something like that would be the word. I think it's the same result. If you try and not not evolve your martial arts, eventually, if you don't evolve your martial arts, you're going to lose. It's the same thing with language. Yeah. You become less effective communication with in language as far as that goes. The word literally now. Okay. Literally, we know at Lahey, here's the hard part about accepting this, because literally means something very specific. There's no ambiguousness. If it started to be ambiguous, you wouldn't say literally, say figuratively or are, you just won't say anything.

Speaker 4:          02:49:56       That's what I did. That's, that's the defining characteristic of the word, literally. But here's the thing. Now literally doesn't mean literally, literally means just re almost a lot. Oh yeah. Just really strong. Not even, almost literally. It's just really strong. So if I was like, man, this guy joke was so funny. I was literally dying, right? I wasn't almost dying is not what it means. It just means it was super duper duper funny. You know what's changing? Yeah, man, that's a hard one to accept. Like and all. I think there's another word, but in America, in California, this is a recent one, so maybe the 80 [inaudible] everyone's to in order to say said, said like, or all echo was like, you gotta stop doing this. And I was all no way we're going to do that. And that's just the way the language of orals.

Speaker 4:          02:50:48       Dang. That's cool. Hey Man, I dig it. It's all nonetheless fifth, you want to buy this book regardless, regardless of the language in it. It don't do that.

It's like just it's, yeah, it's like the Internet in general. You know, a lot of good stuff like your whole like pursuit can be on the Internet and it can be very beneficial at the same time. Your whole pursuit can be in the internet or you do, and it can be detriment.

Speaker 4:          02:52:51       Do you mean your pursuit?

You get caught up watching some nonsense and not even take one step towards three d modeling. I spent what I'm saying, it's the dichotomy of the Internet.
