Speaker 1:          00:00          How do you control rumors and gossip within an organization?

Speaker 2:          00:05          That's pretty easy. You just, you just talked about being, you know, getting out there for the truth and your propaganda arm to outside your company. It's no different inside your company. You've got to make sure that people [inaudible] I, it's interesting that when you were, we work with leaders sometimes you see people that are like, well, I don't want to share those with my people. You know, cause I don't know what they might think. Like they're, they're thinking something that may be totally not true. They're, they're not just sitting there not thinking anything because you're not sharing it with them. They're coming up to their own conclusions, which may be completely false or opposite. But like we say in the, in the, in the navy all the time, you know, perception is reality. That becomes reality. So you've gotta, you gotta you can defeat the gossip and rumors by actually just sharing the truth.

Speaker 2:          00:44          Be Open with people and uh, and, and, and be in first out there with a message so people get an understanding. And even when horrible, bad things go wrong, extreme ownership, right? If, if you take ownership for that and say, Hey, listen, this happened. Here's what we're doing to fix it. Here's what we're doing to turn things around. Um, it, it's kind of people, people are not going to lose respect for you and the organization. They're actually going to gain respect for you as a result. Something we talk about all the time. So don't be afraid to do that again, just get the message out there and, and, and be transparent and talk to folks.

Speaker 1:          01:21          If you don't tell people what's going on, they're going to make up their own ideas of what's going on. And the thing that I have to, I have to, we have to, we have to take this just a little bit further, right, just a little bit further because we talk about transparency, right? And that word gets thrown around all the time. And uh, of the idea that you're just going to you that the idea that you're just going to tell everyone exactly what's going on and that sounds great. And it's like, Hey, I'm a fully transparent leader and I'm gonna tell everyone's going on. But there's times where you actually don't want to do that. There's times where you have to maneuver and you have to be tactful and some of the things that you might tell someone actually is not the right thing to do.

Speaker 1:          02:03          Now I'm, I'm, I, I'm not saying we're, we're, we're going to be dishonest with our people. I'm not saying that and I'm saying that transparency is a great thing, but I mean, just on a personal level, if laughs, laughs, uh, working for me and he's not doing it, he's doing something horrible is the best way to go about that to fully true. Full transparency is [inaudible] you're doing horrible at this. Is that the best way to do it in front of the entire team in front of the right is that, is that it's full transparency, right? Hey, I'm fully transparent. Okay, everyone welcome to the meeting today by the way. I just wanted to point out that life mrs numbers again and he's a loser. That might be what I'm thinking. That's fully transparent. Hey guys, I knew love lists too, right? Just being transparent. Laughs and laughs a loser.

Speaker 1:          02:45          He missed his numbers again. And you know what I'm actually thinking about firing him just in case anyone was wondering. So that's not going to wait to close the business Friday. Did I do a good job? Right? So, so let's not get carried away, right? You know, is the smart way. This smart ways to maneuver the smart way is to say, okay, lace not doing what he, what he wants to, what he should be doing. If I go and accuse him of failing, what's his reaction going to be? How's it? So what I do instead, instead I go, I want to take ownership of it. And so instead I say, hey leaf, you know, hey, come to conquer my office. I want to talk to you about a couple things. So he comes to my office or not in a public place and now it's, hey leaf. Hey Man, I noticed that you, you know, you, you, you missed your numbers and I'm thinking that maybe I'm not giving you the kind of support that you need to, to get where you need to be. Is there anything that else that you need from me so that you can win again inside? Sure. I'm thinking Lafe you pathetic loser. You missed your name.
