Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number one 45 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. The primary mission of the Marine Rifle Company and platoon is to locate, close with and destroy the enemy by fire and maneuver or to repel his assault by fire and close combat.

Speaker 2:          00:00:29       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:00:31       The primary mission of the weapons platoon of the rifle company is to provide supporting direct and indirect fires including clothes in anti tank fires and demolitions for maneuvering or defending elements of the rifle company.

Speaker 2:          00:00:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:49       Boom. It does not get much more straight forward than that. That is taken directly from FM FM six tack for Marine Rifle Company. And this is a, this is a solid manual, a very solid manual. Very solid field manual. Huh. And one of the reasons that I pulled it out again, because I wanted to look at the general principles of war and this has, so the the U s military, all branches talk about the principles of war as the Amir as America sees the principles of war. For whatever reason, the FM FM t six tack for has sort of the best descriptions of them that I like, I should say maybe they're not the best. They're my preferential once the ones that I prefer. So the principles of war pretty straight forward, but I wanted to talk about them and this kind of led me down a little rabbit hole, which I sometimes go into when it comes to, you know, military strategies, principals, tactics. Sure. And I ended up in a place that I, that I thought was very interesting. It kind of brought me back to something that I had uncovered years ago. One of those early things that started to

Speaker 1:          00:02:12       Gel. My thought process started to, started to see little, little, little connections in the world. Yeah. So it started with this. So the principles of war, so they talk about just these broad principles of war. Again, everyone in the military covers these prints are ever in the u s military covers these principles of war. Here's how the Marine Corp in the Marine Rifle Company manual discusses them. Okay. Principles of war general. The principles of war are fundamental truths governing the prosecution of war.

Speaker 1:          00:02:52       That's so legit. Anyways, I'm going to read that again. The principles of war are fundamental truths governing the prosecution of war. There you go. The principles of war are guidelines to be used by a commander to effectively apply the combat power of the marine company or platoon to aid in the accomplishment of the assigned mission. The effective application of these principles is essential to the proper exercise of command and the conduct of war. Although combat leaders have studied the principles, it is not enough to name them in sequence, but rather to know when and how to relate them to the combat environment. The principles of war are included here to provide a review for the commander to be used when applying doctrine contained in this manual. Now, the important parts of remember is, and you're going to see this, that these principles do not only apply to war at all. In fact, they apply to everything.

Speaker 2:          00:03:56       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:03:56       Principle number one objective. The objective of a military force is the goal or aim usually expressed as a mission for which the force was constituted. This principle is overriding, it's, it is the apple. It is applicable to any operation at any level of command. The objective of a force can be stated in either broad or precise terms, depending upon the nature of the goal. Each element of an infantry unit contributes to the attainment of the objective of the larger unit of which it is a part. For example, when the objective of a battalion has been defined, all elements of the battalion must be assigned objectives that facilitate the attainment of the battalion. Objective success in combat is measured by the accomplishment of the mission. So this is important to remember from a leadership perspective. When you come up with a mission and it's a broad mission for your company or for your team, then the smaller teams within your team have got to redefine that mission as it applies to them and make sure that what they come up with for mission is aligned with and supports the broader mission of the team.

Speaker 1:          00:05:10       So when you own a manufacturing plant and your goal is to manufacturer x amount of widgets a month, well then the people on the line, they have their little portion of that widget that they manufacturer and they got to make sure that they can fulfill their part of mission that allows you to do this overall success. Also, there's like supply people that are bringing the supplies in for the widget. Their goal, their mission is to provide the supplies needed to make these things and so that's what it is. You've got to make sure that the, the mission of the sub subordinate units are in support of a nested inside of the broader mission, but sometimes we forget as leaders that the f the front line or the subordinate people below you and the chain of command, they might not understand that they need to do that might not happen, so you need to do it for him. Sometimes you need to spell things out. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:06:09       next or offensive

Speaker 1:          00:06:14       by the offensive, the commander can impose his will on the enemy, set the pace and course of battle, exploit enemy weaknesses and meet unexpected. Develop a developments. Boom, be on the offensive. What do, what do we call this? We call this default aggressive, right? That's the, that's the similar not, and I will continue to make the comparisons between what we talk about w what I taught, what I came up with, the original four laws of combat and how they are intertwined with these

Speaker 2:          00:06:52       principals. Back

Speaker 1:          00:06:56       to the book. Even in the defensive, the commander must be alert to regain the initiative by offensive, counteractions aggressiveness, flexibility of mind, and the ability to make rapid reasoned decisions are required to apply fully the principle of the offensive. In defense, the commander can often best accomplish his mission by office of action. So even when you're on defense, you should be, you should be looking to go on the offense. And there's some other definitions that talk about, and this is very, very clear. When you're training Jujitsu, have you ever trained with someone? Well, I know you have. When you're training with someone that's constantly attacking, yes, that's, that's you're going to go down. I mean, you're going to, when someone, that's how someone gets the upper hand. They're attacking here. They're attacking. They're, they're attacking over here. They're attacking back there again and you're constantly on the defense, defense, defense, defense, and eventually they get the upper hand and crush you. Yeah, very clear. In Jujitsu.

Speaker 2:          00:07:54       [inaudible] next simplicity.

Speaker 1:          00:08:03       Simplicity. Demands that detailed a simple plans be adopted in every military operation. It's interesting dichotomy, detailed and simple. It is of course a relative term because all actions in war are essentially complex. That's a great point. And I talk about that too. I talk about how easy it is to like how these, how a mission, hey, so easy to see a seal mission is not rocket science, right? It's not brain surgery. You've, you know where the bad guy is, you know where you are. You're going to load in some helicopters are some vehicles, are some boats. You're going to go to where they are and you're going to get them and you're gonna come back. There's the mission that's a little over simplified. To me it'd be, and it's not that much over simplified, but you know there's things like fuel, there's things like load load plans. There's thing about weight, how much each vehicle can carry or how much each helicopter can carry this. So there's there are and how you're going to put cover fire down there. A, there are more detailed things. So like the statement says, all actions in war are essentially complex. And I will say that all actions in war are also essentially simple. Hmm. Because what are you trying to do? You're trying to close with and destroy the enemy. That's it. I've had that happen with companies where I go into a company and

Speaker 1:          00:09:16       they've lost sight of the simplicity of their mission. Yeah. The simplicity of the mission is to make something and they get all wrapped around all these other things, but what you're supposed to be doing is making this thing and everything that you're doing should be lead to supporting the making of this thing. And people go down, they focus their efforts in other areas. So it's good to think about. Yes, there's complexities. It's, it's, it's a total dichotomy. It's a total dichotomy in business too, right? There's a total dichotomy. It's, it's very complicated, but at the same time it's actually very simple. Hmm. So when you feel things getting too complicated, that's when you take a step back and go, okay, what is we, what are we actually trying to do here? That's the question. Back to the book. Simplicity will be especially important on the new Keeler battlefield.

Speaker 2:          00:10:06       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:07       Where the full use of available means will require close control and coordination and where plans must be simple, as simple as the situation will, will permit detailed simple plans lead to coordinated timely execution. So what's interesting at the copy that I'm using of this, and it's going to lead to the rest of this whole podcast, which award, which is when we're going to start talking about the Soviets and which goes back to the eighties I think the date on this book, on this particular version is the eighties which is cold war, prepare for nuclear combat. That and when are we getting to the Soviets and what they're thinking you're gonna see nuclear combat was absolutely part of it was part of their planning. Yeah. And so same thing here. I don't even know that I have a comment about keeping your nuclear war simple. I don't know if I have a comment on that.

Speaker 1:          00:11:06       Hey, we're going to drop bombs and everyone is going to die. I don't know how we simplify that anymore. And clearly laws a combat simplicity, simple. That's one of the primary laws. That's actually law number two in my laws of combat that we put an extreme ownership. And why is that? Because I would see over and over and over again what would jam up to use your term, what would jam up? A seal platoon is a complicated plan. You would do it every single time so you have to keep it simple. That's one of those ones. Before I really started diving into sort of the broad canon of military theory, I, I had told everyone, hey, you got to keep it simple. You gotta keep it. And Anna, I'd been told, you know, the Vietnam guys would say keep it simple, stupid, you know, Kiss. But I, I was a little nervous that I was maybe overboard with that. And, and as soon as you start looking at it, keeping things simple is a broad military principle that's been around forever. And there's a reason because it's true. Next up, unity of command, unity of command is the establishment of a single authority. This is the best means of ensuring unity of effort, which implies a singleness of purpose and cooperation by all elements of the command.

Speaker 1:          00:12:34       That one seems obvious. I'll tell you what prevents this from happening. Most of the time it's ego. Most of the time in the business world, it's, no one wants to say, hey, you know what? We're putting this other guy in charge. Give them the support that he needs most of the time in the business world. Why? Like, you know, we don't want to make Billy feel bad. So you know what? You run this part of it and then you run the other part of it and then, and then Jennifer over here, she can run the, so it's all, it's actually all three of you are going to coordinate together to, uh, to make this happen. Well, who's in charge? You're all in charge. How's that workout? Not Good. The only way it works out good as if one of those people or or two of the three people are exquisite leaders with no egos and can prop up the other person that's an egomaniac and make them feel good and let it happen. Otherwise it's going to be problematic. You'd see this. So in the military what they do is they designate someone as the main effort. So one, one company or one battalion will be designated, okay, you're the main effort. We're all here to support you.

Speaker 1:          00:13:39       That's it. That's something you definitely have to be careful of. And I'll tell you, I'll give you a little hint, a little help. The best way to do this is just to do it. The best way to do it is be like, Hey, you know what? I need one person running this. So Billy, you got this one, Jennifer, I'll probably give you the next one, but Billy, you, you need to, you need to take command of this one. I know you know this terrain a little bit better. You run this one. Jennifer, if we go over to your your market area next time you'll be running it. So do what you can to support Billy right now cause you he'll be supporting you in the future. Boom. Done what we what people do. They want to have the harder conversation. They don't want to just tell Jennifer that she needs to take the back seat on this one. That hurts too much. So they put everyone in charge and now you've got no one in charge. Now you've got a disaster on your hand. Unity of command. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:14:32       next mass mass depends or sorry. Mass demands that superiority of combat power be attained at the critical time and place for decisive purpose. This superiority is both qualitative and quantitative. Combat power is primarily a combination of firepower and maneuver, which is applied at the right time, at the right place for decisive purpose. So what does this mean? Focus your efforts. This means prioritize. Next, execute. This is the same thing. This is the same idea as prioritize and execute, which is pick where pick what the biggest problem is and that's what you're going to attack. Focus your resources on it.

Speaker 1:          00:15:22       Back to the book. The use of nuclear weapons by enemy forces will require greater dispersion for passive defense. Therefore, a greater stress must be placed on the application of mass from the point of view of time rather than space. Violation of this principle exposes the command to the risk of piecemeal defeat. Even buy an inferior your enemy. Let's hope we don't have nuclear war. Next economy of force economy. Oh, before we get there mass. Another. Another way that this relates to Jujitsu is that when you get an arm lock, what are you doing? You're focusing all your strength on the one weak point of the enemy. When you get to choke, what are you doing? You're focusing all your force on that one weak point of the enemy, their neck, you know, next number six, economy of force. Economy of force requires that sufficient force be applied at other than the decisive time and place to permit mass to be applied at the point of decision.

Speaker 1:          00:16:40       These two principles, economy of force and mass are so closely related that they cannot be considered singly application of the two principals requires a sound estimate of what is sufficient elsewhere to permit the attainment of decisive superiority at the decisive time and place. Sufficient is the key. It connotes the application of force necessary to accomplish the purpose and not the application of as little force as possible. So economy of forced, this is, we heard a lot about this in judo, right? When we, when we talked about judo in depth, it's all about economy of force. That's sort of the underlying principle of judo, which therefore makes it one of the underlying principles of Jujitsu depending on what kind of game you got. That's what it's going to say. I mean, that's cool in theory, but you know, again, on the mat it's not going to be like that all the time. I mean, yeah, if you can perfect it. Good. So that's what, there's some people that have the kind of game where they're going to use an economy of force to their advantage because they're going to wear the other personnel. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       I would say I actually do that. I do that. I don't, I will, I will allow people to move around and get tired and that's sort of a good thing for me to do. I don't do it all the time and I can't do it to everyone. You know? I can't, it's right now, I can't really tie around Andy. He's, he's, he's not getting tired right now. And the, yeah, the um, that's the general principle, you know, like it's just generally that's what you're doing, whether you're perfecting it or not. Generally that's what you're doing. So like, you know, when you're a white belt and someone mounts you, or even if you mount somebody, you're like going for stuff and you're trying to get out immediately and all this stuff. Even though, Bro, that's not the best time to get up and you can kind of use timing.

Speaker 3:          00:18:31       Actually, I understand your point where they said, okay, the best time to get out is right when they get through it. By the way, that's the best time. That's the best time to disrupt any situation. Yeah. Like if you've got a situation like a self defense situation, you just disrupted immediately as soon as it starts. Right. And you just poke some, you know, stick a pen in their eye and run away. Right? You don't wait for them to grab you and how you do. You don't do that. An active shooter situation. No, you don't think, oh well I'm going to see where this is going. No, you immediately disrupted get out of there as fast as you can wait around so you don't let the enemy settle in their position. Because once they settle in their position, they're there. Now they can now focus on what's happening because they're no longer having to focus on settling.

Speaker 3:          00:19:22       Right. They've, they've established position. When you, when you were fighting against an established position, it's problematic for the, and I guess, you know, maybe it's little bit different, but technically it's in the transition space, isn't it? Transits. The Dean does a really good job of teaching where as the person gets into their final movement to get in position, he teaches where the gaps are because there are definite gaps there. And in the middle of a term transition, for example, that's, that's a huge gap. But in a way, since they don't necessarily have whatever the position they're going for, like the amount, for example in the transition to the mountain, they don't really have them out. So that's a huge gap. But it's not technically escaping them out technically because they don't have it. When you go to the other side of that, that transition still in the transition though, maybe the site, we'll call it the second half of the transition.

Speaker 3:          00:20:14       It's be way before they settle for sure. Yeah. That's where it's going to be 100% but when you're a white belt though, let's say they, they settle in and you don't want, someone gets like, okay, we're gonna use the mountain as the example. The guys mounted right. Hooks it or feed established and wait to establish holy mountain, the mountain, God established whatever. If you're in a tournament, oh, and the early, the earlier on you and you're just, you're going to be trying to get out of there. He immediately getting guns. Yeah. And that's not economy of force right there because it's like person is fully established. Yeah. In fact I'll go ahead and tell you you're,

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       you're wasting energy. Exactly. That person is fully established, very lost your opportunity when, during that transitional period. Right. So the point there though is indeed you too. The more you learn, the more you kind of learn about Jujitsu, the more you, you realize that yeah, this, this, that's a general purpose. Like your hold you get to game is economy of force, right? Your whole game, you're not going to perfect it every single split second of the year you get to know sometimes you'll even step outside of the rule to make something specific happen or when it's arts dean will be like, oh that was a spazz defense. Like I'll just could get nuts for a few seconds because you, you know, in hopes that a opening opens up and oftentimes it does when you're stronger than that guy for a second or whatever. I condoning or encouraging the spazz as the premier escape situation.

Speaker 1:          00:21:35       Cause it's not, cause there's plenty of times, especially against an unskilled opponent, they can spousal, they want, they're not going anywhere. Yes, correct. Yeah, exactly. Right. And now I got something, you know, I talked to, uh, I was talking to Dave Burke about this good deal team and from a leadership perspective, there is also something very similar that happens from a leadership perspective as a leader, let's say, okay, when you're a black belt or a brown belt, you have someone that's a white belt right there. You're mounted on them and they're grabbing whatever they're grabbing. They're grabbing it with full, like craziness. They're grabbing your belt or they're, or they're grabbing your sleeve like as hard as they possibly can or they're grabbing your neck. It is no factor, right? I mean it's literally no factor to you if you make it a factor that me just means you're not experienced enough.

Speaker 1:          00:22:31       That means you, if you're only, if you're only an a blue belt and you're going against a lower blue belt and you might start getting concerned about this, but when you're a black belt, you're like, oh, this doesn't matter. From a leadership perspective, there's things that are going on with your team, with individuals on your team. And if you don't know what you're doing, you're concerned about them and they freak you out and they make you react. And yet if you're a black belt, these things happen and you just, you just realize what they are. It's just wasted energy for them and it's going to have no impact on longterm deal that you're, you know, where you're going. So it's a, it's a clear indicator to me when I'm working with a leader and they're spun up about little things, I, for some reason, I always think of like they're spun up that the person's grabbing their, their belt, right? You're mounted on them and they're grabbing your belt, like they're gonna do something with it. They can't do anything. That happens all the time. From a leadership perspective, someone, you know, some of your subordinates or scope doing something crazy, it's like, okay, does it really matter? Most of the time it doesn't even matter. Occasionally you've got to address it. Like if a guy, if your guys, if you're mounted on a guy and starts to lift your knee,

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       you reached down and address it. No big deal. You don't panic. You don't give up the mount. Yeah, you just address it and then you, you take it back to normal. So as a, and what this has to do with really is, has to do with detachment because you, if you're detached, you'll see that whatever the situation is is not that big of a deal. But when you're all up in the fight and they're grabbing your belt or grabbing your sleeve and you're freaking out, you're not doing a good job of detachment at all. Feels like, right? I don't know what it is. I don't feel right about it. I see it all the time. And by the way, here's another important piece. If they're doing something, if they're grabbing your sleeve and now you expend energy to stop that, well, you're expending energy. You're not following the idea of economy of force.

Speaker 3:          00:24:35       And what you're also doing is you're giving up leadership capital because you're wasting time trying to stop them from doing something that doesn't even matter. So why are you worried about that? Let that thing go. Just let that thing go. Focus on the wrong thing. Yes, yes. Yeah. In one when I was a bouncer, they, this was part of the training, but they did call it minimum. The minimum minimum of course. Yeah. Which kind of when you're training could kind of, it's kind of like, especially if you've been in like breaking up like a significant fights situation, you start telling me I gotta use minimum, it just sounds off. I know what they mean and this is what they mean right here is sufficient. They made sufficient. They basically do, they don't want you over doing it. Yeah, they do mean they do mean minimum, but they also mean sufficient cause the minimum, well if you use the minimum force required and it works, then that was sufficient.

Speaker 3:          00:25:23       Yeah. Yeah. And I, and I understood it when they said it. Of course like it's a one, one we're not in the situation and like, yeah, that's true. We'll use it. Just I like how they use sufficient though because it one one you hear like especially if you're talking about warfare or in my case bouncing when you're breaking up guys fighting with you know, bottles or whatever and they're saying, hey, use the minimum. You're like, no man, we're going in there. We get it done as quick as we can. But the thing is it's like no Bruh. Like you're not to use maximum. Yeah, you're not going in there swinging punches, you're breaking it up, you know kind of thing. And it makes sense because guys will do that. They'll be like, well you're, you know, kind of thing. And then they'll like injure somebody or something like that when they don't have to. Yeah. Not Good. And then efficient. Sufficient, sufficient force check. Alright. Next maneuver. Maneuver requires that all military resources be brought to bear in the accomplishment of the objective. Correct. Application of the principle of maneuver requires not only the full use of combat power at the decisive time and place, but includes the movements of elements of combat power, including combat service support to the area of operations. That's pretty straight forward. You have to move your people in the right positions,

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       including the support people that need to get there to keep the logistics lines open, to keep the intelligence flowing, to keep the radio is working on all that application of this principle is a function of command at all levels. At the highest level, it usually means the movement of men means and supplies to an area of operations and at the lowest level it means the positioning of troop units and fires to destroy the enemy straightforward. That's what that one is next. Surprise. Surprised connotes striking the enemy when, where or in such a manner that he is unable to counter effectively. The achievement of surprise is not necessarily dependent upon misleading the enemy as to intentions such as, for example, concealing from him an intention of attacking. He may know from the situation that he will be attacked. Yet the attacker may achieve surprise by the time place, direction, size or composition of forces or tactics employed.

Speaker 1:          00:27:50       Yeah, that one's pretty straightforward. That one's pretty straight forward. That's the, that's the difference really. That's the difference. That's one of the differences between like a white belt and a blue belt. I mean it's actually, it's, it's not even two blue belt yet. You've got to be able to surprise the person. They can't know what's coming in Jiu Jitsu if they know what's coming and they know any Jujitsu that are going to defend that thing. So surprise comes when you are baiting him with one thing and you hit him with something else. And when for I've told them, I told you that story. Like when the first, when I was like a white belt, I'd probably been trained in for like four weeks. And this seal buddy of mine who had been training for a while but kind of off and on and, and he was a friend of mine and as soon as I was training for like a week, I was like, hey, let's train incident.

Speaker 1:          00:28:41       So I was kind of roughing him up. Right. Cause he, he's training off and on and, but he's a good dude. He's a great dude. And I said to him, so after like three weeks, I said to him, you don't, here's the thing in Jujitsu, you can't just do one move. You gotta like set it up with something else. And the next time we were old, he was going for a choke hard on me. And I was like, dude, this guy's man, I don't want to talk to this guy. I can't let them. Boom, here are mocked me. And I was like, whoa. Yeah, yeah. And I, that was the last time that happened. You didn't like that was awesome. Was, he took just, he took just my words of what I told him and this, this guy's a frigging awesome seal. He took just my words of what I told them and apply them to what he already knew physically about how to do a choke and how to do normac. Yeah. And he'd are mocked me. Yeah. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:29:43       Surprise, surprise. You go through these just kind of naturally too, because they're like, since they're grappling movements, like unless you're one of these super duper quick guys, you know, like everything's going to be more or less telegraph. Do you know if like if I say, Hey Jocko, um, if I know you love the arm lock and you don't go for arm locks, I know that's coming. Yes and no. I, I agree with you. There's sometimes when I submit people, when they'd completely know that it's coming and they can't stop it, Dean does that to me where it's like he's getting an arm lock and I can't stop him. He couldn't say like, here it comes. And I'm like, oh, I know it's coming. I can feel it coming. I can feel it and I can't stop it. Yeah, but here's the thing about that technique too.

Speaker 3:          00:30:25       That's like their will. There's two elements that go on in here. One, there's like, Okay Dean, cause we talked about this before. Well Dean, he's going to say, Okay Dean, I'm a thing that the surprise came earlier. Yes. Position. We're not either he was ahead of you now or he's in a position where all your defenses that he knows have to comfort for you to stop him. He knows the defense and all that. He put himself early on into a position where he can shut down those differences before to the point of this, he did through surprise, there's some little movement and all of a sudden he's mounted with my arm exposed and now I know how to get our unlocked. I kick it, kick it out of exactly right. But sometimes so, but so sometimes you do submit people like that where they know it's coming, but you're right.

Speaker 3:          00:31:10       You got to get that surprise movement to get insufficient in position. And they're also, the second part is, uh, Mike, like little for lack of better term Mike Crow surprises. So it's like, you know how it's like, Hey, I'm going to go for this arm lock and I know your arm luck is coming. But just even for like a half a second split second, I'm going to like tip you off balance and just for that split second you're like, oh, your mind goes okay, are you just your body reaction? Like your reaction. Oh I gotta put my, you know, you know that it's like our early movie learn and um, Akbar used to do this all the time where, you know, the setup sweep from the card sit up suite for the guard and when you base you go straight, you go back to the triangle.

Speaker 3:          00:31:46       That's what cause two to basically put your arm down. You can get your leg over like that. For example, like if someone likes to do triangle, Jill tutor used to do that stuff to me all the time because he liked to triangle and yet he do these little things that you got to put your arm down just real quick. Even if you're like, yeah, just real quick, I'll just put it down real quick to base or whatever and I'll put it right back into the defensive position. Like Bra. That's a little micro surprise. Even though you weren't dressed in the dark the whole time and where did that triangle come from? It's not that, it was just for that little little split second he split second surprise. It's a surprise that works. Hey, back to this, um, maneuver like I feel like that's like, and I learned this from you, where put simply you say, hey, build the relationship with people. Like you're like, Hey, my boss won't listen to my input or my coworker won't, you know, listen to my, my strategy, which is awesome. And all this stuff. You're like, hey cause you're just going to straight. You got to, you

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       got to create a relationship. You've got to get into the position. You know, I just got this question today, I was getting interviewed and the guy's like, you know, that guy's like, well, I mean, what happens when I even see it's already, it's like, it's like when someone says, well, you know, it's like in Jiu Jitsu when someone says, well, you know what it was the guy does this and say, well, yeah, so the guy says, well, you know what happens if you get told to do something by your boss and you don't agree with it? And he just says, do it my way anyways. Right. And I'm like, well, I don't get in situations like that. Why? Because I've spent the last six months, eight months, one year building a relationship up with my boss where my boss tells me to do something that I don't believe it.

Speaker 1:          00:33:21       And I say, Hey boss, I don't know if this is a good idea. How about we do this a different way? My boss says, oh, thank you John. Thank you for not allowing me to tell you to do something. It doesn't make sense. Yeah. So you're right, it's a preemptive, a preemptive maneuver to be in the right position so that you will not get told to do something. Now, does that mean I haven't done a bunch of things that I didn't want to do leading up to that point? Yes, absolutely. That's called building leadership capital. I'm going to make my boss when over and over and over again. No one wants to hear that. I just got to when when Lafe and I were out in Staten Island guys like, you know, what can I do to lead people that are that debt don't want to do, you know, do what I want him to do.

Speaker 1:          00:34:03       Tech man, you got to build relationships with those guys. You can't bark orders at them. It's not going to help. It'll help for a minute. Like they'll load that truck up, but they're looking for another job. You know what I mean? You've got to build relationships with these people up and down the chain of command and you know what that is? That's maneuvering. You are correct. Yeah. Yeah. I thought that was critical or critical. Yeah. But really helpful because again, that's one of those things where you gotta do, you got to detach, you've got to, you got to kind of step outside and be like, hey, cause that okay to build a relationship with your boss, no one thinks like that. That's the solution to the problem because directly it's kind of not even though a huge, huge, yeah. Why would you say it directly?

Speaker 1:          00:34:46       It's not, cause it's straight up is, well it doesn't seem like it put it that way. Well if you just think kind of, I don't know, for lack of a better term, linearly, like if I'm like, Hey, I want Jocko to loosen to my input, right. A direct approach to would be like, hey Joe, go take your headphones off. Listen to my input. That's like a direct, so if I go indirect, right, that's more like, hey, I got to build a relationship first, then I can, it's basically adding another step. But that step is like this straight up requirement and, and, and the thing is this, it's not a step, it's a broad underlying fundamental situation that you set up for success. Yeah. And, and then there's this whole thought that, cause I, and I've said this on here many times to say it all the time, I built relationships with bosses that I didn't like.

Speaker 1:          00:35:36       Right. And People, oh well Jockos at an ass kisser. Yeah. And Jack was a brown noser cause he just tried to build a relationship with his boss. And I always say, no, I'm not a brown noser a known on an ass kisser. I'm winning. I'm here to win. That's what I'm here to do. If you know what I'm here to do, take care of my platoon and make sure that they can have what they need to accomplish our mission to the best of our ability. If my, if I have an antagonistic relationship with my boss, can I truly support my platoon? The answer is no. All Day long. He's not going to give me the gear that we need because he's unlike me. He's not going to give me the training that I need because he doesn't like me. So why is he going to give me what I need?

Speaker 1:          00:36:12       He's not. But if I have a good relationship with them that I built, then guess what he's gonna do. He's gonna let give me what I need to accomplish my mission and he's going to give me what I need to be the most effective platoon we can have. Now where does it cross the line? Where does, where does, where does Jocko become a brown noser and an ass kisser. Cause we know these people exist and I'll tell you exactly where the line gets crossed. The line gets crossed where I'm kissing my boss his ass so that I can get promoted or I can get taken care of her. I can take care of myself if that's what game you're in. Yes, you're an ass kisser. I don't like you because you're doing it for you. It's like the difference between manipulation and leadership, right? If you're doing, if you're, if you're influencing people so that they do something that's gonna help the team and help the mission and help them, that's influence.

Speaker 1:          00:37:02       If you're doing something, if you're influencing or that's leadership, if you're influencing people so that you can help yourself and benefit yourself. That's, and it doesn't help the team and it doesn't help to mention that's the manipulation leash. Yeah. Yeah. Fully. Yeah. And when you go outside of the scope of like the broad goal, you know, and I can see it by the way everyone, everyone can see it. Everyone can see it. Yeah. Everyone can see it. And what's really jacked up or, and it's not even jacked up. What's kind of cool is if you're looking out for the boys and you're looking out for the mission and you're doing everything for their, for their, for the best, for their best, that shows through to, yeah. And when that shows through, guess what your people, your boss wants to take care of you. Cause you're trying to win for him, you know, not for you.

Speaker 1:          00:37:58       So yeah, but the way you say it, I mean obviously you're, you're, you're not new to this concept, but you know, and you're not new to the concept of one year in the situation if you don't like the person. And now Jocko wants me to build a good relationship with this person that I don't like or whatever. But I'm not keeping it real. That's what it's like, what it be like this to face guy. You think I'm going to be give him my respect, my valued, coveted respect and man, that's, I'm, I keep it real. I keep it to reel to reel for that. I'm not gay. I'm not bowing down to that guy can do it. Cool, so you're going loose. Yeah. So you'd rather lose. Yeah. See, but when

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       you put it into perspective again, that perspective that you put it in, which is, which I did, what's, what's, what's interesting just to, just to take that to one more level. If you're the guy that's like, Hey, I've got too much pride to do that, I'm not doing that. I'm not bowing down to him. Okay, so you're going to lose. Because to me, I look, I don't just look at it like one hit. That's the end of the game. The game doesn't end there. The game ends when I'm on top with the big win. And you know what? My Ego, my ego won't allow me to let my ego interfere with the fact that I want to win a big game. The long game, I play the long game in this one. In all of them maneuver. Yeah. A little bit of maneuver. Maneuver. Yeah. If he can get into a habit like you kind of nuts.

Speaker 3:          00:39:19       You surprised straight up surprises me because I forgot by the way, cause it's not as, doesn't come as natural with one of your answers at roll call when you were like, hey, build a relationship. Oh like you're, you know this person is when you know, you remember the situation and the person didn't like you didn't follow through as much as he should have. And because he's so good you can't tell him anything kind of thing. And then it's like, no, you gotta you can't like harp on this guy. You got to build a relationship with him. I was like Aww Dang. Cause that's a lot. Most of the time that's the answer. If you ever have a problem with somebody like not doing it, you know, like just like I said, most of the time, most of the time what people think they should do. How should I confront this person?

Speaker 3:          00:39:59       Should I care them to do what I wanted to do? How can I confront them? Should I fire them? Which it's like, oh, you know what you should do? Build a relationship with them. Make them understand. Make you understand where they're coming from. Can you lead someone that you don't understand? Not really. Here's another one. You get someone if, if you're, oh, oh, this person that works for me, thanks. It's all about him. What should I do? You should make them think it's that everything's about him. Yeah. That's the, that's the black belt. The black belt movies like, yeah, you're damn right. This is all about you and here's how you're going to win. And by the way, the whole team's going to be winning because you're winning, but we don't worry about that. We're worried about if your perception is that, oh, echo, echo thinks this is all about him, guess what?

Speaker 3:          00:40:43       I'm going to make echo think he's writes and he's going to be busting his ass cause it's all about him and the team is going to echo is going to win, which means the team's going to win, which means I'm going to win. Yeah, it's a no brainer. All you gotta do is step back six to eight inches from the, from the, from the front line to take a look around and see that pretty far, six to eight inches. When you need to know this is the other thing. No one wants to hear those answers. No, no they don't. I shouldn't say no one, but most people don't want to hear those answers. Yeah, because the fact of the matter is is it's your fault. Yeah, it does. When your, when your person is not doing what they're supposed to be doing, it's your fault. Hey, do you get the person that just has a totally negative attitude that shouldn't be on the team? Yes, they exist. I get that. Whose responsibility is it to get rid of them? You get two years here, the boss, if they're not that person, whose responsibility

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       is it to get everything you can out of them? It's you. You're the boss. Yeah. People don't like to hear that answer. No. It's a hard answer because you want to throw whatever you know, all the millennials, the big one, right? The millennials are, oh, well, maybe if maybe if maybe if you were a better leader, the millennials would be on board. It's a hard thing to face, but if David Hackworth and Jim Mooky Yama can get draftees in Vietnam to go and risk their lives and fight the enemy and possibly get wounded or killed in a war, they don't believe in. If they can do that through good leadership, I think you can get a millennial to get get after it, and by the way, there's millennials getting after it everywhere. I meet him all the time. Yeah. They're not like, Hey, I did. Hey, it's good to meet you. I'm glad you're putting out word about how to be lazy. No. They're like, I am going to crush the world. They're out there. Yeah. It takes a little bit. Yeah. What it takes, it takes leadership. That's what it takes. I'm sorry. Leadership is not easy to people do. The millennials don't want to listen. Who wants to listen? I was more rebellious than any millennial off Matt.

Speaker 2:          00:42:49       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:42:50       Let's see. Anyways, so next security security provides readiness for action or counteraction and is enhanced greatly by flexibility. Flexibility in mind, organization and means contributes to security. It's attainment embraces all measures designed to avoid being surprised or interfered with seriously. And the retention of freedom of action.

Speaker 1:          00:43:24       Security is not imply. Undo caution and avoidance of all risks. Important security does not imply undo caution. So there's a dichotomy here. It doesn't imply the avoidance of all risks for bold action is essential to success in war. And what does bold action requires? Requires risks. Otherwise it wouldn't be bold when security is provided. Unexpected developments will not seriously interfere with the attainment of the mission check. So I've got to maintain security. That makes sense. So those are the nine principles. This is the nine principles of war. That's as they existed. Now they also talk about, and there's a debate right now going around of weather, weather flexibility should be the 10th principle. Some people think it should, some people think it shouldn't. And then in 2011 they added some principles to joint operations and here are those principles. Number one is restraint to limit,

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       correct collateral damage and prevent unnecessary use of force. So now we're getting into the minimum force, right? Restraint requires careful and disciplined balancing of the need for security, the conduct of military operations and the national strategic end state. Make sense? That's where they came up with us. You have to put that minimum force. That's what that is. That's the same thing. Right. And I think the key to that, they put on the end, the national strategic end state. So what does that mean? Sometimes if you use too much violence, if you as a bouncer use too much violence, you're, your goal of your mission is a bouncers to keep the place safe. Yeah. If you use too much violence, people don't want to go there cause the bouncers are, are, are assholes, right? They're beating everyone up. That's a problem. Yeah. So what's our strategic end state is that we keep this place safe.

Speaker 3:          00:45:23       So that's why they, they're talking about that same situation. They actually changed our name from bouncers to, uh, fursuits host. Wait, Whoa, whoa. They call it there. You're not bounces your hosts and then with the change it to a door host. No, no, no. Okay. They went, bounces the to know you're a doormat. No, you're just adore the dormant and they're like, no door hosts fits like the personification of this place. You know, like you're just, yeah, that was a good trial. It's interesting. Yeah. It's interesting though, because that's a little leadership maneuver that they're doing. They're trying to, they didn't do a good job because you're joking about it. Right. You thought it was a joke. He liked us and ridiculous. The thing is, I actually wasn't men and it ultimately, I was like that. That totally makes sense because when you think bouncer, you think dive bar guys, beating up guy, you know, bouncing these guys out the on off the wall.

Speaker 3:          00:46:14       I'd roadhouse talks about minimum force though, right? And boy. Yeah. Dalton. Well, what does he say? He said be nice. Oh, that's like the rule, right? He nice and he's like, uh, ask him to walk, but be nice if he doesn't walk, walk him. But be nice if he, if he still won't walk, get another guy to help you walk him and you will both be nice. And he said you be nice until it's time to not be nice. Oh, that's super bad ass. Right. Good. Hold it back. You're good. All their back. Right. That's like the, the, the to hold it back. That smile like the Bio, what do you call it? Not The Bible, but the movie version of the, you know how you have like what do, what's the navy seal movie? But when you got to, you know, for, for pilots it's top gun. You know, if there's a seal on the one with Charlie Sheen. Yeah. But I don't even know if that's the iconic, not as iconic as roadhouse. If you're a bouncer and you watch in front of, that's your thing. Yeah, for sure. No, it's the iconic belter I don't even, is there even another bouncer movie? I don't know. Shouldn't be as it doesn't even exist. Nope. Exactly right. Check. All

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       right. Next. This is one of the new ones. One of the new principals. Perseverance. To ensure the commitment necessary to retain the national strategic end state. The underlying causes of the crisis may be elusive, making it difficult to achieve decisive resolution. The patient resolute and persistent pursuit of national goals and objectives often is essential to success. What I don't like about that one

Speaker 1:          00:48:01       is it it, it, it kind of, it kind of says it's, it's saying like, well, what's the number one rule objective? Like you've got to know what your mission is. You got to have an objective, and this one is saying, look, the underlying causes can be elusive. It can be difficult to achieve decisive resolution. So I guess the theory or the principle of perseverance means we're going to continue to do this. My problem with that is that is how do you end up then or do you end up then with a Vietnam, we're continuing to fight even though we're not quite sure what our end state is, what our objective is and it's so elusive that we're not sure where to go. That one makes me a little bit hesitant. Do I believe in perseverance? Absolutely. You keep going, but as I've talked about before, don't quit. Doesn't mean never give up on the the plan that you came up with and just keep going until you freaking either die or you achieve your goal. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49:04       Next legitimacy to maintain legal and moral authority in the conduct of operations legitimacy, which can be a decisive factor in operations is based on the actual and perceived legality, morality and rightness of the actions from the various perspectives of perspectives of interested audiences together. These 12 concepts form principles of joint operations. Now I'll tell you what's interesting about legitimacy. Obviously you have to have it. You have to have, you know, moral and legal authority. The Prom I, the problem I have with that is who gets to judge that? Because the per the people that you're fighting, they don't agree with what you're doing. You're not legitimate in their eyes. So how were we coming up with that? I think, I think we can, but I think we have to do that decisively and say, look, this is what we're trying to achieve. This is why.

Speaker 1:          00:50:06       And if there's a bunch of people debating about it, okay, well we're going to hold off then until someone says, oh, you know what? This needs to be stopped. Or the situation situation needs to end because you do need legitimacy and if you don't have legitimacy, you're going to have problems really, truly accomplishing the mission. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean kind of in a way, I mean, I'm sure there's obviously, but in a way there's always going to be like some deep date. You know, how like, they'll be like, hey, you know, I'm going to make a generic example, but like you, you know, if they some turmoil in this country because of the way these people are treating these other people in this country, right? Boom, US steps in and all this stuff. Some, there's going to be somebody debating, hey, like that's their country.

Speaker 1:          00:50:47       That's how they roll. You know? It's like who are we to step in and call them, you know, immoral or whatever when that's how they'd been living for thousands of years. Yeah. That's my point. So yeah. Who gets to make his decision? Yeah. Well it's a tough one. Yeah. Like almost like a, like a global standard needs to be established, you know? And I think that's kind of the end. And I think you, I think it is actually possible to do that. I think so too. I think it is actually possible to do that. And I think the fact that we sometimes decide that, hey, it's not our place to make that decision. Like I'll give you an example. Isis, hey, if you're systematically raping eight year old, nine year old, 10 year old girls and boys, you don't get to do that. Right? We will come and stop you.

Speaker 1:          00:51:35       Yeah. That's the way it's going to be. Yeah. And you need, if you need a documented argument for why that is, I think, I don't think that'd be a problem to produce. I think if you need a documented argument for that, you just made the list as well. We're coming after you. I think I agree with you sir. So yeah, Nazis, guess what? You don't get to do that same dealio imperial Japanese army rolling into China. Rape of Nan King. Nope. You don't get to do that. That doesn't work. We're not okay with that. You just made the list.

Speaker 1:          00:52:14       We seem to have a harder time doing that. We seem to think these days that evil doesn't exist. Yeah, and that's wrong. It's wrong. Next, next it talks about the application of the principles application, the principles of war. So that's, that's the, well, it's now the 12 principles, but now I'm going from the new principals that were added on back to the 1984 Marine Corps Field Manual Fmfm six TAC for rifle company application. The principles of war act as a checklist for the commander in order to apply combat power effectively and reduce his units of vulnerability. A review of military history will demonstrate that those commanders who have adhered to those principles have most often enjoyed success on the battlefield. There you go. I like the fact that they're taking these principles and broadly applying them to the past and saying, look, when this happened, historically you will have victory. Most of the time there have been, of course, exceptions to the rule. However, these exceptions prove the rule that any attempt to rigidly apply all the principles to all battlefield environments may lead to defeat. We got to, we got a little chapter in the dichotomy of leadership. It's called disciplined, not rigid. Yeah. Why? Because of what that just said.

Speaker 1:          00:53:49       The commander should recognize the need to apply the principles as flexibility as all other tactical principles, oh, sorry. As flexibly as all other tactical principles based on the circumstances with which he is confronted, flexibility in the application of principles is as important as flexibility in the application of combat power on the battlefield. Isn't it cool to come up with principles and then just say, yeah, you got to apply. I'm like, as needed. It's interesting. There's a, there's a, there's a, it shows how much you have to think as a leader. Yeah. You have to look at things all the time and sometimes your principals getting ready to back off though. And that's Kinda what we did in the dichotomy of leadership because can you make things too simple? Yes. You can cover and move the number one principle. Can you cover and move too much? Yes. You can prioritize. Next. Cute. Can you prioritize and execute too much? Yes you can. What does that look like? It looks like target fixation. What is, what does cover move too much look like? It looks like you're stepping on the toes of other elements. What is too simple? Look like? You haven't covered all the contingencies. What is too much decentralized command look like? It looks like your people don't even know where you're supposed to be going because you've haven't made it clear. You've let them go too far

Speaker 1:          00:55:14       back to the book. No commander can rigidly follow the examples provided by doctrinal resources but must modify them according to his mission, the situation and the terrain over which he is fighting.

Speaker 1:          00:55:30       So there you go. Now what was interesting is I found this in an air force manual. So that's, that's what I covered from that Fmfm six tech for, which is just really good broad principles of combat principles of war. Now it was interesting, I was looking at an air force to kind of get their perspective, similar perspective, not as detailed, but one thing that they did that was interesting was they put the other countries principles of war and compare them to our principles of war. And a lot of them are very, very close. But one of them that stood out was the former Soviet Union. And, and this is where we get into, you know, I was talking specifically about the USSR back in the day, back in the eighties back in the 70s you know, this is the other superpower in the world. And they have some interesting theories. And, and again, there's a little chart that I found it kind of laid out, you know. So in America we have objective in Great Britain and Australia, they say selection, maintenance of aim, right? So understand what your aim is. We have on offense offensive in Great Britain, Australia, they have offensive action.

Speaker 1:          00:56:54       We have mass meaning we're going to use our concentration of force. What does Great Britain and Australia call it? Concentration of force. We both have economy of force. We call it maneuver. They call it flexibility. We call it unity of command. They call it cooperation, which is interesting. Cooperation is very similar to cover and move. Yeah. We both have security. We both have surprise. We have simplicity. They don't have simplicity, but they have another one called the maintenance of morale, which is an interesting, important thing that maybe we left out. Why do we leave that out? It's an important one. France, they have three concentration of effort. That's the same as mass surprise. That's another one and then their last one, liberty of action, which is interesting. That's decentralized command, right? Hey, you've got to go out and make things happen. Yeah. China, they have some similar ones. Objective, they call it selection and maintenance of the offense. They call it offensive action mass. They call a concentration of force maneuver. This is an interesting one. Maneuver. They call it initiative and flexibility.

Speaker 1:          00:58:03       Again, a little bit of decentralized command sprinkled on that unity of command. They have coordination, they have security, they have surprise and their last one is morale, mobility, political mobilization and freedom of action. Interesting dynamic from China and then they, they listed out the Soviet, the former Soviet once because this is one of the largest armies that ever existed. This former Soviet Armand Army. And as I was reading that little, this little, this little chart about what the Soviets had masking and correlation of forces economy and sufficiency of force initiative, Surprise Mobility Temple. I was, I was going to, there's, I remembered reading an old assessment of the Soviet style of warfare broken the dude and I remembered it had some interesting takes and I was able to find this field manual from the 80s I want to say again, this is, these are like from the same time period as the FM that I just read from the Marine Corps, the FM, there's updated ones which we can cover as well.

Speaker 1:          00:59:08       But these are the old school ones. And again, it's in the 80s I mean you wouldn't assess the Soviet Union the same now as you would then. So this, we had a manual, America had a manual FM 102 tack one the Soviet Army and I thought it was kind of worth reviewing some of what, what they talk about principles of war because again, this was like one of the largest standing standing armies in history. It was our major foe. It was well experienced from World War II. So figure with all that, you know, we probably could learn something from them. So here we go. Getting into the Soviet Army a little bit and some of their principles, how they, how they rolled the introduces it by saying the Soviet ground forces. This field male describes the operations and tactics of Soviet general purpose ground forces. The content is based on information in Soviet writings and other open source literature. Most available information is focused on potential battle in central Europe. This is when this was the reality. Folks, this is in the 80s.

Speaker 1:          01:00:25       The Soviets believe that any future war could involve the use of nuclear weapons and that the initial stage of the war will be decisive. This is crazy. Tactical nuclear, tactical, nuclear weapons have been assigned at all levels from division up. That's crazy. Wait, so what does that mean? Everybody has new, well, at the division level, so yes, a lot of people have, a lot of people have nukes. Uh, the Soviets have the largest and most effective array of chemical weapons and equipment in the world. They are capable of employing chemical agents from battalion level upward. That's crazy. So a battalion is like the lowest fighting unit that we have. It's, it's, it's, I don't know, 500, 600 maybe 700 guys generally. And imagine 700 guys with a, with an o five. This is a probably a 35, 40 year old guy in charge of it. They got chemical weapons on the battlefield ready to employ. And by the way, two levels above them. At the division level. That's what we're talking about. Nuclear Weapons.

Speaker 1:          01:01:42       Not exactly what I love. Okay. The Soviet front, I had to put this in here. The font is the largest field formation in wartime. It is an operational administrative unit and its size and composition can vary widely depending on the mission and situation. Roughly equivalent to a US or NATO army group of front. It could be composed of three to five armies with organic artillery, missile layer defense engineer. The reason I found that funny little layer, there's, I often refer to Ashkelon front simply as the front, but what what is also interesting, I looked up front to see if that was a commonly used, if to see if that definition and it did. They didn't have it listed. They didn't have a, this is a, this is a group, an army group. They didn't list it that way. So That's interesting. Learn something new. All right.

Speaker 1:          01:02:42       Um, at this time they're saying that the Soviet ground forces were like 1.8 to 2 million people and 191 maneuver divisions. So to answer your question, 191 divisions and each one of those hundred and 91 divisions had tactical nukes. Get some man, and now we get into, so just that just kind of lays out how this came together. Okay. The Soviet concept of war to the Soviet's war is a manifestation of the class struggle. It is an expression of the conflict between progressive forces of socialism and the reactionary forces of imperialistic capitalism, which they feel will ultimately raise B, which w which they feel will be ultimately resolved in favor of socialism. The Soviet concept of war represents, represents a continuation of politics. Same thing that we have. We, you know, we think of war is when, when politics don't work, that's when war happens, unfortunately. But yeah, reactionary forces of imperialistic capitalists. You know what that is? That's America boy.

Speaker 1:          01:04:03       Uh, that's how the, that's how parts of the world view America. All right. The Soviet military doctrine is officially accepted. The Soviet military doctrine is the officially accepted set of concepts that delineate the ways and means to achieve military objectives in the interest of politics. The formulation of Soviet military doctrine is a continuous evolutionary process based on number one communist ideology. Number two, Soviet foreign policy. Number three, economic and military strength of adversaries. Number four, Soviet resources in geography. Number five, history. Number six, science and technology. Soviet military doctrine is based on an elaborate integrated system of thought and then it breaks it down a little bit more. And I kind of had to build that in there cause it talks about military doctrine and then it talks about military science is the study and analysis of the diverse psychological and material phenomena relevant to armed combat for developing practical recommendations for the achievement of victory in war.

Speaker 1:          01:05:09       Pretty straight forward. But the reason I had to say or talk about military sciences because I wanted to get to this point, which is military art and a lot of times we don't think of the Soviets. Right? What do you think of the Soviets? What do you think of? I, I know what you think. What do you think of when you think of the Soviets? Come on. When you think of the Ussr, what do you think of? You're going to let me down, Bro. What? What do you think of when you think of like the, the Russians, what do you think of these? They're strong wrestlers. Okay. As a whole. When you think of the Russians, what do you think of, if you had to characterize the Russians in one individual, who would you think of? Stalin? Ah, close. I thought you were going to say Drago. Okay. Ivan [inaudible]. Ivan Drago the machine, right? Sure. This is what this is. That's what I think of. You know, I think of that. That's what the Soviet Union is. It's like the, you know, no emotions, no religion. It's just raw machine. Cold. Right? Actually fairly accurate. Yeah, but they go here. Military art is the most important and primary field within military science and is the basis for strategy, operational art and tactics is the theory and practice of conducting armed conflict. So they put this high hide.

Speaker 2:          01:06:22       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:06:23       Respect to the art. Art. Probably interesting. Possibly higher than we do. Maybe you know it is possible. All right, so now we get into it. And principles of military art. Soviet military theorists consider the following points to be the general principles of military art. So that's what, that's where I'm going with all this guys to get their principles. Gotcha. They do not represent any special revelation of truth or radical departure from traditional male military thought. However, by their emphasis on these particular points, Soviet military leaders reveal their character, the character of their military thinking and predict the basic characteristics of future Soviet military operations. According to the Soviets, they're armed forces must, and here's the list before we prepared to accomplish the mission, regardless of conditions under which war begins or must be conducted.

Speaker 2:          01:07:22       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:07:23       next, achieve surprise whenever possible. It sounds familiar. Military operations must be characterized by decisive descent, aggressiveness forces must strive continuously to seize and to hold the initiative. That's good information. Next, make full use of all available military assets and capabilities to achieve victory. Next, ensure that major formations and units, all of all services, branches and arms effect through thorough and continuous coordination. Got To work together. Cover, move, select the principal enemy objective to be seized and the best routes for attacking it. Make a decisive concentration of combat power at the correct time, right? Same thing. Next, maintain continuous and reliable command and control. Interesting. The reason that's interesting is that's like a little bit leaning towards centralized control, right? Centralized Command as opposed to less committed, but they're going to reverse that later. Next, be determined, decisive in achieving the assigned mission. Next, maintained complete security of combat operations. Security, right? Same thing. Next, reconstitute reserves and restore combat effectiveness as quickly as possible. Makes Sense. Next. Well now it continues on. These are general principles that apply to all three levels of military art, strategy, operations, and tactics at each of these levels that are more specific detailed principles. Soviet military fought, subscribes to certain laws of war at the strategic level and principals of operational art and tactics which apply to the actual conduct of combat. So here are the laws of war

Speaker 1:          01:09:10       first law, the course and outcome of war waged with unlimited to employment of all means of conflict depends primarily on the correlation of available strictly military combatants at the beginning of the war. Second law, the course and outcome of the war depending on the correlation of the military potentials of the combatants. Third Law, the course and outcome of war depend on its political content. Fourth, law, the course and outcome of war depend on the correlation of moral, political and psychological capabilities of the peoples and the armies of the combatants. Now, I didn't break those down because they actually do it for you in the manual. Here's what in simpler terms, what these things mean. First law, be prepared, prepare in peacetime for the next war. Forces in being are the decisive factors. The side with the most and best troops and equipment at the start of the war will win the war. That makes sense. Barring any major strategic blunders, second law, the side which can best sustain a protracted war will win the war. Makes Sense. Third Law, the higher the political stakes of a war, the longer and more violent it will be.

Speaker 1:          01:10:29       That's a good one. That's a good one. And you got to think about that one. From a leadership perspective, when you start getting involved in things that have higher stakes, this is when people start stabbing each other in the back. So people get ruthless. So when there's more at stake, there's going to be more violence,

Speaker 2:          01:10:49       Huh? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:10:54       We don't recognize that sometimes, hey, this guy's always been cool to me, but all of a sudden the stakes go up. All of a sudden we're getting stabbed toward the dirts coming out. Right. The claws come out. It's always interesting. You get to see people's real true colors, right. When things are at stake, when more at stake, people's true colors come out, the violence occurs.

Speaker 3:          01:11:17       Yeah. Yeah. Can I like when the, you know, the detective shows up at your door, hey, let got some questions for you. Ah, I don't have time. Whatever. All, we could do it here, or we could go back to the station. All right. All right. You know? Then they start revealing little bit more. Then they're like, hey, they don't want to cooperate that much. They say this thing. They say, yeah, I was there, but I don't remember all this stuff. And they said, well, hey, if you don't tell us the truth, you could be going to jail. All your freedom. Now the stakes go up off. They start talking more. See what I'm saying? Then they say, hey, your friend, was he involved in what I'm saying? And you're like, oh no, no, no, you're right. Hey, if you're lying, not only do you go to jail, then you know, and they raise the stakes a little bit. Odd. They ran on their friends.

Speaker 1:          01:12:01       No mm clinic where the stakes go up. Go Up. Yeah, man, the violence increases. Next fourth law war aims must be seen as just modern war cannot be waged without public support. Very important. Yeah, very important. So Viet Planning and preparation for war reflected dominant feeling that war is inevitable. This is not to say that the USSR wants war, but that is preparing for it continuously. The Soviet state is autocratic, militarized, and centralized. It's political and economic systems give priority to military requirements. The state allocates resources and directs production for preparation and maintenance of a war footing. The Soviet Union is prepared to exert itself at great expense to achieve its goal. It is a nation which through civil war, collectivization attendant famine and purges inflicted more than 20 million deaths on its own citizens from the Russian revolution to the start of World War II. It is a nation that endured the loss of 20 million people during World War II. It's tolerance for sacrifice is high. Yeah. That's a little something to think about. Now what's interesting is what's stronger that or the core desire and mandate for freedom that we have here, and actually I can answer that question because history has answered that question. Freedom will win.

Speaker 2:          01:13:54       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:13:56       Next, as the laws of war dominate strategic planning for war, so do principals of operational art and tactics govern the conduct of warfare within a given theater of operations. The popular Western version of these Soviet and tactical principles is very brief. Objective offense, surprise, maneuver, and mass. This list is not fairly characterize the basis on which Soviet military leaders plan and conduct operations and tactics. Just as they add new equipment to their forces without abandoning older equipment. The Soviets have modernized operational and tactical principles without fully abandoned, abandoning their earlier ones. A good place to begin is with those classical principles that were taught by the czarist at general staff. So these are the classic Russian military principles. Here they go. First, extreme exertion of force at the very beginning of the war.

Speaker 2:          01:14:55       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:14:56       next simultaneity of actions. Next economy of forces. Next concentration. Next chief objective, the enemy's army. Next surprise. Next unity of action. Preparation, energetic pursuit, security initiative and dominance over the enemy's will strength where the enemy is weak and that's the list. That's the old classic list and it breaks it down a little bit. The most significant points of this list are

Speaker 2:          01:15:29       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:15:29       First, he who gets to the initial battle with the most wins. That's sun sued. By the way, the enemy must be confronted with more than one situation to deal with. Oh, that's, that's how I got are locked all those years ago. I was dealing with that choke and there came me arm lock. Next one should not be diverted by geographical objectives, but should concentrate on the destruction of the enemies. Military forces. Next, detailed, exacting preparation must precede and attack design actions to preempt your opponent and keep him reacting to situations that you control. Concentrate on the enemy's weak points rather than his strengths. Contemporary military, contemporary Soviet military theory just hold that nuclear weapon tree and other means of modern warfare have modified these basic principles. By the early 1970s the following principles dominated Soviet operational art and tactics.

Speaker 1:          01:16:37       So they literally made these adjustments for nuclear war first mobility and high rates of combat operations. Next, concentration of main efforts and the creation of superiority and forces and means over the enemy at decisive place and at the decisive time. Next surprise and security. Next combat activeness. That's a good one. Combat activeness. Next, preservation of the combat effectiveness of friendly forces. Next conformity to the conformity of the goal to the actual situation. That's a good one. Conformity of the goal to the actual situation. Know what that means is your goal can change and it can change based on the situation you're in. Yeah, that is important. And the last one is coordination, which is basically covered move. Now it goes on a melding of contemporary writings and those of the recent pass plus an influence of significant classical Russian principles results in the following specific Soviet principals of operational art and tactics. And we'd go into a long list. The offensive is the basic form of combat action only by a resolute on offense conducted at a high tempo and to great depth is total destruction of the enemy achieved. So we need to go hard. We need to go fast. Next combat maneuver units must be mobile and capable of rapid movement. Next fire support, command and control and logistics must be as mobile as maneuver units. That makes sense. Conduct or conduct thorough and continuous reconnaissance. Find the enemy's weak points. Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:18:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:18:26       Perform a thorough estimate of the situation and make timely analytical decisions. Be Realistic.

Speaker 1:          01:18:35       Consider the mission enemy, your own combat power, terrain, weather and light conditions and time. So yeah, you got to look at this situation. You've got to look at it. Best thing about that and you don't hear this very often. Be Realistic. How good advices that it's damn good advice. Yeah, be realistic. You don't hear that often enough. Next plan and prepare extensively and in detail. That's a good idea. As we know though, you can go to the extreme with that. You can overdo it. The planning and conduct of an operation must involve the full coordination and cooperation of all commanders involved. That's important. If you're coming up with an operation, you got to involve the commanders that people that are going to be in the operation with you. You can't just send them an email of how you want it to go down. That's not going to work. There must be unity of command, a signal commander for every operation. Boom. We already talked about that. Fully orchestrate all of the all available combat means in coordinated, cooperative, combined arms effort. Makes Sense. Next to deceive the enemy. Attack from an unexpected direction at an unexpected time. Check. Use terrain and weather to your advantage. Check strike early with great force check.

Speaker 2:          01:20:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:20:00       Constantly strive to preempt and dominate the enemy. Again, I was thinking when I hear that, I always think of Jujitsu when someone's getting the upper hand on you and you can't dig your way out of it, attack the enemy violently and simultaneously throughout his depth. Carry the battle to the enemy rear with swift penetrations by maneuver units, fire aviation, airborne and Hella born assaults. And by unconventional warfare means be bold and decisive, seize and hold the initiative. Isn't it amazing that just being aggressive goes so far? If you are just get the upper hand. I mean if you get the upper hand you just have it and you just need to maintain it. How do you maintain it? It's by be continuing to be aggressive and not sitting back on your haunches when you got the upper hand. I do that and you just do some time. What? Sit back on your haunches or yeah, get a little bit of a advantage. Relax too much. Let let a little, you know, let a little time give that person to, you know when you see it as an MMA, when somebody gets dazed, right. And the person lets them recover, takes him a minute, takes them a minute and 30 seconds. They don't get on that person. Yeah. Got To do that. Prosecute and operation relentlessly without pause under all conditions of visibility or NBC contamination. That's nuclear, biological and chemical contamination. Doesn't matter. Keep going.

Speaker 1:          01:21:33       The Russians, this is good. Keep the enemy under constant pressure and off balance. Do not allow them to react effectively. Obviously Jujitsu, fully exploit the effects of nuclear or chemical strikes with deep attacks by all available forces. I wonder what these guys were thinking. They're thinking about how they're going to follow up the nuclear assault bro. Whenever possible achieve mass by concentrated mask nuclear or non-nuclear fires rather than by massing maneuver forces. What that is actually saying is instead of using your troops, use nukes instead to get the upper hand. Good Lord man, how did he get to this? I mean we, we can look back on it now. I hope. I mean, cause there's obviously new cars everywhere still, but man, I hope people aren't sitting around plotting right now coming up with the tactics. I mean obviously we have to. You have to, you have to game it out.

Speaker 1:          01:22:49       Yeah, it makes sense. But man, I hope we got some other avenues of approach before jumping into the wall. New quantia's next. If maneuver forces must be mass, do so rapidly, disperse them as soon as possible after the task has been achieved. Maneuver first with firepower. Firepower is maneuver and move gets some maneuver forces should attack the weakest points in the enemy defenses. Yes. Sun Tzu. Thank you. We agree if necessary, create weak points are holes with nuclear or non nuclear fires. Bypass enemy's strong points of strike and is, yeah. Hey, you know what? We were going to create a wake weak point with nukes. Get some, it's funny to hear that. How like nukes is just sort of one of the, I'm just throwing it out there, just throwing it out there. We're not talking like, hey, is anyone going, hey by the way, that's the end of the world.

Speaker 1:          01:23:41       Hey, hey kernel. Hey Kernel I got, I just want to bring something up. You realize that we all die when this happens, right? Like this isn't, this isn't like a good plan. You're planning socks. Yeah. Like hey we get it. Hey there's a little, we had to create a weak point like right over there. Hey we should send like, like you know like maybe 12 guys or something maybe over it or we could just use this new cause it's here or maybe I'm going to send this document to a Jordan Peterson cause cause you know, you know how we use all paranoid about new nuclear war when he was in college and that's kind of what sent him down this path of how could we get to this situation is going to really disturbing. It's like hey boss, look, check this out. When you guys were playing.

Speaker 1:          01:24:22       Yes. How we're going to create a little weakness where the nucleus Newcomb man, scary. It's very scary. Avoid frontal attacks wherever possible. Strike the enemy in the flanks of the rear. Obviously we're all about flanking. Maintain security rule and flanks. Maintain sufficient follow on, forced to assure achievement of the mission and to end to deal with contingencies, maintain a uninterrupted combat support, maintain effective continuous command and control and communications. That's getting a little bit, you know, that's important, but sometimes I think that they were very centralized and you can see that from when they fought in Afghanistan that they definitely had some centralized command going on and the units that perform well with a few that would have the most decentralized, which was generally their special operations units maintain redundant communications at higher levels, rely rely on audio and visual signals and well-rehearsed battle drills at lower levels.

Speaker 1:          01:25:17       Staffs at every level must have equipment and skills necessary to collect and analyze information quickly employ radio, electronic combat to deprive the enemy of effective command and control of his combat forces. That means they're going to use jammers and whatnot at here. Now this is where it's interesting, so as much as I talk about centralized command, adhered to the spirit and letter of a plan, if the plan fails, use initiative to accomplish the mission check, that's decentralized command. You can only do that if you actually know what the mission is. Next, to be prepared to react effectively to a rapidly changing battlefield. Check, develop procedures to deal with numerous contingencies, check, think quickly and be decisive and resourceful in accomplishing the mission. Check, conserve fighting strength through the use of combat vehicles with collective NBC protection. Again, that's nuclear, biological and chemical protection. Disbursable forces minimum combat power necessary to accomplish the task. The use of captured the enemy equipment and effective logistics and then that's the end of the list. Obviously it's a pretty broad list, but very interesting. You can see the parallels. You can see how the same themes come up over and over again and it says this, these principles are idealistic. They are what the Soviets strive to achieve. They show what the Soviets would like to do, but not in all cases what they may be capable of doing. However, the principles serve as a basis from which any examination of Soviet operations and tactics must start

Speaker 1:          01:26:57       and it can't. It's just crazy to read about this nuclear warfare implications. The advent of nuclear weapons caused Soviet planners to go through a long period of rethinking and revising their combined arms doctrine. Modern, totally mechanized armed forces supported and threatened by weapons that can change the face of the battlefield in a matter of minutes, gave a whole new meaning to the high speed combined. Our operations in depth, uh, when we talk about can die combined operations are combined arms in, in the military. We talk about, you know, we're going to use mortars or we're going to use artillery. We're going to use your air sport. Where do you use, you know, heavy machine gun fire. We're going to use all those together in coordination to, to catch our enemy in the combined arms dilemma where there's no way to get out of it. It's like checkmate, right? Yeah. I never ever thought about, hey, let's get him in the ultimate checkmate over here on this one. Bring in, bring in the tactical nukes again, just just to point out that,

Speaker 2:          01:27:59       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:28:02       under nuclear threatened conditions, the Soviet offensive concept would have the following features, avoid concentrating, forces, concentrate fires, but not firing weapons. Attack across broader frontage is on multiple axis. Avoid enemy's strong points, probe for enemy, weak points, penetrate where possible, commit, follow on forces when and where they can best contribute to success, drive rapidly and deeply into the enemy rear to destroy nuclear weapons and enemy forces.

Speaker 2:          01:28:36       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:28:37       and just to wrap this up because I thought this was an interesting, we're not covered a bunch of this book, just like we barely covered any of the marine corps rifle. Uh, manual. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:28:48       Norms, initiative and flexibility as Soviet military doctrine includes a system of performance standards expressed in numerical forms called norms. Norms defined the ideal performance in a multitude of tasks and conditions. I've talked about task conditions and standards on here before. They are used to determine such things as intervals. Rates of March frontage is logistics requirements, fire support and training drills. Norms provide a mathematical prescription for proper action. So this is where we get to, you know, I started thinking of that Soviet stereotypical like, hey, we're just going to, here's the numbers, plug them in and that's what we're going to do. They are formulated by historical analysis, training exercises, requirements and gaming models based on norms. A given situation has an approved response. The correctness of commanders action or his troops response is often measured by their adherence to the established norms for that situation.

Speaker 1:          01:29:52       The advantage of this system is that it provides a high degree of combat readiness, at least in the initial stages, drills at the sub unit level, battalion or lower our well-rehearsed, the tactical level commander is aware in advance of how well his troops can cope with time and space factors. The and so there's, there's what's good about it. You have everything like laid out like this is what we do in these situations. Back to the book of the obvious disadvantage to strict adherence to norms is less provision for the unexpected. If a situation arises for which there was no established normative response, a lower level commander might find themselves in peril, which I totally agree. That's why I made the training super hard and crazy for the guys that I put through training so that they were ready for non normative situations. The topic of initiative receives much attention and Soviet military writings.

Speaker 1:          01:30:45       When a plan fails, commanders are strongly urge to use initiative as a cure. All the Soviet perception of initiative involves finding a correct solution, following normative patterns. If the commander adheres to norms and a successful he is praised. If he violates normative patterns and fails, he's condemned. So what, what kind of a decentralized command do you end up there? No one wants to take any risks. Success, however, is most important. If commander solves a problem by his own devices, he is lauded. So that's cool. But if you're afraid that if you make a call and it doesn't go right and you're going to get in trouble for that, you know what you're gonna do, you're not gonna make a call. And that's what crushes your decentralized.

Speaker 3:          01:31:30       Yeah. Isn't that like a good tactic or whatever for like kids were, you know, like if they make an honest mistake, you don't just hammer him, you know, you can correct them or whatever. Um, otherwise, yeah, they're not going to want to like venture out and do things, you know? Yeah, totally.

Speaker 1:          01:31:48       And, and this, yeah, you have to, you have to allow your kids to make some say. I I've been saying lately, you've got to allow your kids to brush up against the guard rails of failure without smashing them. Yeah. The bumps and bruises or when a good are what are, what go is going to make them formidable in life. If they never got a bump or a bruise, life's going to hit them hard. They won't be conditioned for it. And this thing wraps up just saying these concepts are not descriptive of a rigid or offensive doctrine, but one that is both mobile and flexible. So there's a little something from the, from the Soviet army in, and obviously, like I said, the principles of warfare, while they're nuanced and their stated differently, they're the same. I mean you see the same patterns over and over again and they apply to war and they apply to life. And so I think it's important to see him from different angles so that you can understand them. Because if you understand them broadly, well then you can see him in all things. And if you see him in all things and you can actually apply him in all things, which is important, cause that's what's gonna make you better, it's gonna make your Jujitsu better. It's gonna make your business better, it's gonna make your team better, it's gonna make you a better leader, it's going to make you better and it's going to make your life better.

Speaker 1:          01:33:07       And he's, these principles have been around for a long, long time. So that's the,

Speaker 2:          01:33:14       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:33:14       that's the Soviet maneuver warfare doctrine. And you know, I also recently had to do some maneuvering myself. Sure. A little bit of maneuvering and I, I wanted to, uh, bring it up because it's an interesting little bit of aggression. Yeah. A little bit of maneuver warfare. So I wrote another book and the book is called Mikey and the dragons. Right. It's another kid's book. It's for younger kids, maybe a tad younger than the warrior kid crowd. Right. So we're talking like four, five, six, seven, eight ish, something like that. However,

Speaker 2:          01:33:55       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:33:56       Like the warrior kid books, there's lessons for everyone in there. Yes, there is. Yeah. And so what's interesting, so I wrote this book, I had to, I had like a vision. Does that sound too much? Oh yeah, when you say it, but you know, I dig it. Okay. I had the vision of this book, what the story was. Right. And I wrote it. I wrote the first half, the original idea just like hit me and I just wrote it. Yeah. Like the first half of the book and then a couple of weeks went by because I wasn't quite sure about the ending. Exactly. And then one night I woke up before three 30 in the morning, I had the whole thing, the rest of it. And I sat down and I just wrote the rest of it.

Speaker 1:          01:34:38       It was like overflowing from my brain and I just literally, I just woke up and I wrote the, they took like two hours to finish overflowing from your brain and your heart and your soul. Yeah. I don't know about all Monroe wake up three 30 in the morning, come on. And that's like a, what do you call it? Like an inspired creative genius types. I don't know about all that. Come on, come on, come on, come on. But when I got done I was, I could, I really like, I liked it. Like I realized it was something new. It wasn't nothing. And as soon as my wife and kid, my wife and my youngest daughter woke up that day and I was like, Hey, let me read this to you. And I read it to him and I could tell because as soon as I got done reading it, my daughter was like, read it again, but was even funnier was my wife was looking at me and the look on her face was basically a look of like, I can't believe that you actually wrote that.

Speaker 1:          01:35:33       She looked real suspect and I was like, you know, I was waiting for it. It's like, Oh, where'd you find that? Right. That, and so it was like, no, I actually did write and I, and I, I read it to one of my seal buddies who's got like really monotone voice, but he's got young kids and I'm awesome friends with them. And I got done with it and I was like looking at it as I was looking, I'm, as I'm reading, I'm not looking at him, I'm looking at it right. And I get done and he's got this like classic monotone voice and he's like, how did you even do that? And I was like, okay. So that's kind of, you know, he was stoked on it. And then I read it to you. Yes. And well, you heard it, Mikey and the dragons. And when I first read it to you, cool.

Speaker 3:          01:36:20       You read me one, it wasn't even done yet. Oh. And it was like, I was like, Dang, I was in first, I kind of want a superficial level. I was impressed with your ability to like actually rhyme stole. That's right, cause it runs. Yeah. Cause you don't have some, you know, one time like I dunno me how I'm going to bust out some rhyme I made up. It's gonna be so far fetched. Fred just do better with that. But yours is like, it all fits. It's like yeah, I understand how your friend was like, like how did you do that or whatever. You know, cause it's just not, you can't just throw words together that rhyme. But um, yeah. So here the first version without the big, without the ending kind of thing. I read that in the beginning and you were like, hey there's more and there's an ending or whatever that I didn't quite know.

Speaker 3:          01:37:00       I was like Dang, that's good. That is real good actually because, and you, you up. Cause you always have this little message that's like real deep. You know, that kind of applies to like a huge message and it like it applies to kids directly and then it applies to adults directly though. That's the thing. So you know how like, okay, so I read kids book, I got kids, we all know that. And there's kids book, but the messages is real simple mess. I don't know. There's like a, I don't know, whatever the little kid message, but it's like as an adult, I'm not going to read that and be, I learned that a long time ago. I learned that when I was a kid. But these ones, even all the worrier, kid books or whatever, the bread, these are adult messages for kids. So that's what, that's another thing I was like, Dang, I was thinking that too bad. How do you, how do you do that? You know? And then I'm thinking, you know what happened? You were like scared of something like bugs or something when you were living as this what I was thinking in my head, I don't know, maybe we're maybe your, anyway, so

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       yeah, so the finished one, I think I told you this year, when you read the finished one, I was like, holy cow. That is, that is gold on so many levels. So what I did was I stole the story, borrowed it, I borrowed, this is what you do, but it works. So I borrowed the story. Obviously, I can't remember eyes, the rhyming parts of it, but I understand the story and story. Yeah. I told the story to my daughter has a bedtime story and like she's like, oh, she's like, oh are they show all these questions. You know, cause she thinks it's real. But man, the lesson is so good. So good. Well from your reaction from act actually read to them all of my older kids as well. And the same thing. Super just like stoked on it and a little bit of like, did you actually write them, you know, back kind of attitude. And when I, when I, when everyone kind of had the same reaction, I was like, okay, I need to get this into kids' hands as quickly as possible because you know, it's the arc, typical story of a, of a kid that, as you said, needs to overcome some fears. And it's also a story within a story. Right? So basically the fundamental thing is there's a, there's a boy, his name is Mikey. He's scared of everything. That's his basic situation. And here's how he gets introduced in the book.

Speaker 1:          01:39:12       It goes like this. There once was a little boy named Mike and there were many things in the world that he didn't like. He was scared of spiders and beetles and bugs and always thought they hit under the rugs. They were creepy and crawly and nasty and mean. And he ran from every bug he'd ever seen. But it wasn't only insects that gave Mikey a scare. There were many other things for which Mike didn't care. And that's sort of the opening. So you learn a little bit about Mikey scared, scared of some stuff, and eventually after you learn about all the things that Mikey scared of and how he kind of is sad that he's scared of so many things, you can do anything. And he kind of wonders why is he so scared of everything? And eventually he stumbles upon this book and the book is that there's a book that Mikey calls the Dragon Book.

Speaker 1:          01:40:02       Yeah. Even though the book itself is called the Dragon Prince, but he flips us book open for a second and he sees pictures of dragons and the dragons are all crazy. And so he's a little bit scared, but there's also pictures of like a young boy in there that kind of looks like he knows what's up. And so Mike, he decides that he's gonna read it. And so this is where you get the story within the story because then you, you turn the page and you see the cover to this other book, Different Font, different voice, different situation. The pictures look a little bit different. That's cool. Cause I saw, I only saw some, I need to see the completed just some of the pictures and you know Zach, you know, he knows what he's doing in there. And anyways, the story that's in within the story is it turns out that there's this little prince that loves nick, where the king, who was the prince's dad has died. And of course everyone's all sad because of that. But even more than being sad, they're actually scared because it was the king that always protected the kingdom from the dragons who lived over the hill in the dragon cave. And with the king gone, there's no one to protect the kingdom. The knights are scared. The guards were scared. The only one that everyone is looking to to protect the kingdom is this young prince. And here's how you get introduced to that, to that. But now

Speaker 1:          01:41:27       that the king had died in, was gone, there was only one person to fight and carry on and that person wasn't big or mighty. You are strong. In fact, he hadn't been alive that long. Now the person who had dragons to chase was just a little boy with a smiling face. Yes. The person that now must stand up and be bold was just a little prince who was only seven years old. So the boy eventually realizes he's gonna have to stand up and face the dragons. He goes to his father's war chest and opens it up. And of course the shields super heavy in the store is massive. We can barely pick them up and now he's even more scared. But then he sees at the bottom of the war chest, he sees a little note, little note from his dad, the king, the mighty king, and the mighty king explains to the son what he has to do to stand up. And face the dragons

Speaker 1:          01:42:27       and the notes pretty powerful in my opinion. And the prince goes forth into the fray and through those lessons from his dad and he faces the dragons and we get a result from that. And then the original character and story, right Mikey, he learns also how to face his fears. So that's the basic fundamental story. And the way it came together was pretty cool. Other than the reactions from everyone was pretty cool. So like I said, I wanted to get it into people's hands as quickly as possible possible. So I talked to my publisher about this and I told him about it and I was in the middle of negotiating some other books with them and they of course were like, Hey, we've already got these books that we're looking at. So you know, we'll put this one on the back burner and maybe we'll put it out in a year and a half.

Speaker 1:          01:43:18       It was actually wasn't going to 14 months. You didn't let me down. I didn't like that. I didn't like that. So I said, no, you know, hey, it's all cool, but I really want to get this one out very quickly. I want to get this one out. This was in the summertime. I said, I want to get this one out by, I want to get this one out by let's get the gift, get it to kids by Christmas, right? This is an important lesson for kids to learn. Let's get it to them by Christmas. Get Out November. Kids can get it for Christmas and learn.

Speaker 1:          01:43:43       And they're like, no. And, and if I go back and forth, and finally the message I get is I get message from my children's publisher because they're focused on other things. It's the way it is. They come back and say, look, there's no scenario, no scenario where this book comes out in November. There's no scenario where that happens. And I said, Roger, that. And then I immediately formed my own publishing company called Jocko publishing. I talked to John Bozak who did the art for the warrior kid books. And he was like, okay, we're going, this is due now. And he went into hyper creation mode. And did the, the images are a lot different than warrior kid because of their full color and their take up full pages and their dragons and Crispin awesome this. And he laid out the entire book and did the art and colored it in about a month and a half.

Speaker 1:          01:44:42       And now the book is in fact coming out in November. So in the past when I would talk about preordering book with, you know, so you get the first edition whatnot. And I would always say the publisher doesn't know it needs to know how many books to print, which is true. Now the person, the publisher, the person that needs to know how many books to print is actually me. So if you want to get some, you need to order it. Uh, people might think that this is dumb on my part, which is fun to do this. This is, it's like a lot of taking on a lot of extra work. Probably won't make as much money, should've done it on the normal polishing release cycle so you can get more. Like they have a whole cycle. The way they average. There's a whole thing. There's a whole thing to make the book more popular in all of this stuff. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:45:35       And I just had to look about it. The bottom line is, is I don't really care about that and I'll tell you what, after doing book signings and you see what the warrior kid book does for kids, I don't care about anything but trying to get this book into as many kids hands as possible. If I make less money, whatever, if it doesn't make the New York Times best seller list, whatever, because this isn't about making money or it isn't about making the list or whatever it's, it's about these kids. It's about teaching kids a core lesson at a young age so that they can have a better life. Pretty Sturdy, pretty straightforward aim goal. Mission. Yes sir. So if you've got a kid or you know a kid or you just want to get after it and support the cause over here of discipline and justice and strengthen of overcoming fears because that's what the book is about, then jump on Amazon or this book, it's called Mikey.

Speaker 1:          01:46:38       And the dragons and I appreciate that cause it'll help a lot of kids out and that is no matter what a good thing to do in this world, no matter what kind of judgment you want to put, if you can help out of five year old, a seven year old, a four year old little kid, man, that's worthwhile to me. So Mike in the dragons, do you get get some now obviously we're going to help some kids get on the path with that one. Um, maybe echo you could recommend some ways to get the, you know, basically the masses a little bit tighter on the path. Yeah. Can you tell me and keep us on the path really when it comes down to it, I liked it. Yeah. So yes. So obviously well it is obvious. Like I said last time when we talk about origin, you know, why?

Speaker 1:          01:47:45       Cause what, when you think of path we're thinking what fitness or how should I say capability. I don't want to see fitness or whatever. Not just fitness. Yeah. It's like it's like capability. That's what it is. Capability and Jujitsu, which is essentially it under the umbrella of capability. Somebody asked me today another interview, I'm sure, how do you recommend men? It was like one of those men centric interviews. How do you recommend men increase their confidence? Yes, and I thought about it for a second and I, I was at first I was kind of like, um, you know, I don't know that I need to answer this question. This is kind of one of those things. And then I just thought to myself, okay, realistically, how do you increase someone's confidence? Cause it's kind of a throwaway question in a way, right? Isn't it? A little bit of a throwaway question.

Speaker 1:          01:48:40       It's like, Hey, what magic pill do you have to increase revenue? That's the answer that I think was, was being hoped for. Yeah. Let's hear Jockos version of it. How do you increase your confidence? And let's put that as a, as a damn bullet point on the Click Bait, right? Navy seal tells you how to increase your confidence. Right? Right. It's a click bait all day long. So I don't like those kinds of things. But I thought about it for a second. I thought to myself, okay, where does confidence come from? And then I rattled off. I was like, well, first of all, if you want to be confident, then you should do things like exercise and be physically fit. If you're physically fit, your confidence will increase. You. Tell me Echo, Charles, is that factual or or wrong? That is factual. Okay, so if you increase your physical capability, you'll be more confident.

Speaker 1:          01:49:36       If you learn how to fight, if you learn Jujitsu, Muay Thai boxing, you will become more confident. A, does that sound like I'm a meathead? Maybe? Guess what? It's actually true. Yeah, it's actually 100% true. If you're physically capable and you actually know what to do with your physical capability in a confrontational situation, you will become more confident. Okay, so there's next. What else? Okay. How about we learned to articulate ourselves well. Go. Okay. Yes. Will you be more confident? If you can speak clearly and concisely and people can understand it? Yes, you will become more confident. How do you do that? You practice, you rehearse, you carry on conversations, you read a lot so that you have a better vocabulary once you're done with that. What comes next? Well do we lack confidence if we are in the unknown? The answer is yes. How do you get more knowledge?

Speaker 1:          01:50:34       You study, you read you, you, you do your best to learn as much as you can possibly learn and that will increase your confidence because you'll be more comfortable and more different situations cause you have more knowledge. Yeah. And the final thing is if you, one way of getting this as like a self licking ice cream cone, what I'm about to say, but if you have the confidence to say, I don't know, your confidence will increase so I can go and get interviewed by anybody because worst case scenario I'll say, you know, I don't know about that. I'm not, I'm not, I don't actually don't know anything about that. I'm going to have to pass on that question cause I'm not sure. Am I s is everyone in the world's supposed to think that Jocko knows everything in the world or am I, can I keep, can I get in my humble enough to admit that, you know what, if you quiz me about every subject in the world, I may not know it.

Speaker 1:          01:51:34       Is that okay? It's fine. No one expects me to be an expert in anything in definitely not everything. Like I'm pretty good at a couple things, but not an expert in anything. And so if you do those things, you will become more confident. Yeah. I thought that was pretty straightforward. I think so too. I think that's very, uh, uh, she's an informative, they kind of get that kind of makes it less impactful if I say informative, but yet, yeah, no. Yeah. There's also another aspect, and I guess this is covered by the other ones, but like just stepping up and leading sometimes. Yeah. We'll get you better at it. Right. Stepping up and talking in a group of people, you'll get better at it. Yeah. So when you say like basically like practice, rehearse, rehearse. Absolutely. So the, the talking to people, that's a big one. Like you know how someone will, you'll have like, I don't know, social anxiety and there's this, it's a spectrum. Some people have massive social anxiety, some people just prefer not a lot of people be there, you know, kind of thing. And it's a spectrum. Um, and, and obviously real comment, right? So yeah, if you want to increase confidence, you say, okay, in regards to the talking part, right? In articulation practice, talking to people,

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       like if you go to the store, this is kind of a little mental exercise. They do. Do you get a lot done in the grocery store? Let's hear the mental one. There's a few things I actually do. How do we increase confidence as a drill in the grocery store? Okay. So, and I kinda got it from like being in like Oregon and sometimes in Hawaii where, so in Oregon, right. Okay. So we'll compare the two scenarios right. In, in San Diego compared to Oregon in San Diego. If I go in in the, I dunno, frozen foods and someone else, they're kind of in front of the peas, whatever I'm getting and I'm going to, I'm going to politely, hopefully politely wait for them to finish and leave. But put bluntly, that's like, I'm going to wait for them to get out of my way and so I can do what I have to do.

Speaker 3:          01:53:28       And then I'm going to, you know, in Oregon you go to the frozen food section and someone else's there, they're going to look into, hey, it's almost like an attitude like, hey, here, here to shoot. What do you get? You're getting piece to write on like kind of like, it's like they acknowledge for lack of a better term, celebrate the fact that you're sharing space. You know, like almost at the grocery store, you don't kind of just put it, this is my interpretation or the field. Right. So I kinda got that lesson and I'm quite like that too. But it's more because everyone kind of knows each other, you know, or you know, you seen the guy, your AA and they say hi, that's the, so what I did was kind of try to bring that, um, I really liked it by the way, the loss, the law spirit.

Speaker 3:          01:54:13       Um, so now you go in the store and you're just kind of sharing the same space. So I'm not saying every single person you pass, you're bothering them in, hey, how's your, you know, that stuff. I'm not saying, I'm saying if you're sharing their space, say something to them, acknowledge them politely. Right. Where were you have to actively expend energy to say something? Yes, but it's not, there's this straight from Dalton what I'm saying, like actively like engage in their world right there, you know, so, and that goes for like kind of everyone who's sharing space with you and you know how like you're standing there in line and you guys are just sort of avoid eye contact because you're just on your, your thing and they're on their thing and we're going to stay out of each other's way. It's not like don't play it like that.

Speaker 3:          01:54:53       Play it like hey like you make eye contact say is say hi, you know, kind of thing. It didn't try to do as genuine as possible obviously cause you don't want them to think you're going to catch them outside and sell them something or something like that. And then same thing goes for like the cashier. Especially if you see him all the time you use, you don't say the generic, hey, how are you? Like that kind of yeah, I dunno. Like make it for real. Like you care about like, hey, so how was it today? You know, cause you know when you're a cashier you see people after people. If it gets crowded, that's something. If it's real debt, that's something. So you can say, hey, how was it tonight? Wasn't a crowd. I do that more than just a random people. I don't, I usually leave people alone because I want to be left alone in the store.

Speaker 3:          01:55:33       Don't, don't, don't mess with you. Yes daddy your way, Bro. Stay out here with no about the cash register, the, you know, the waitress, the person behind the whatever coffee thing or you know, like I always try and just be nice to them because I know that they're probably having a not nice day because when you're the cash register people are mad at you already just cause there was a line and you couldn't find the chocolate chip discounted coupon thing. And so, you know, I like to give them a little acknowledgement that all good and that there's actually humans out here that are in the world and yeah, well it's the same concept and I'm just in the, my point is that, that's just where it Kinda came from. So the whole point of this is just to increase your confidence in communicating with other humans.

Speaker 3:          01:56:15       So when, when you, when you do that, the more and more you do that, the more just, I would say comfortable. You get just talking to random people, you know, like just people. It doesn't have to be your best friend. And to start opening up a little bit. Obviously not everything, but just, just a little bit. So now you go into a public place it Brian, you're no stranger to talking to strangers anymore, you know, in the morning where you do it. So yeah, you get more confident kind of like, Oh, if this guy what rolls up to me? Yeah. I have no problem talking to this guy. I don't have social anxiety. Yeah. What up, bro? You want to know how my day's going? But I'll tell you. How's that? You know? So it's that feeling and it helped me while I'm over here.

Speaker 3:          01:56:50       Why are you looking at me all I my way? No respite. The low spirit. Oh cool, cool. And speaking of Aloha Spirit, what were we talking about Jujitsu? Well, we weren't our confidence because in order to increase your confidence, one absolute 100% way to increase your confidence is to train Jujitsu. Yes. All Ages. All genders. Let's just say to say safe for age four and up age four and up. Yes, correct. Age for now. Below that is like, there's exceptions from below. It's play time. Yeah. Yes. Which just part of what you just said too, by the way, as a kid. Yeah, for sure. It should be fun, right? Think about this as you do this right, you'll be able to relate to this. So you know, like with your friends when you're young, right? A kid, I don't know, maybe eight nine, 10 1112 when you 1819 2023 whatever you do when you're drunk at a party with your friends, it's all the same deal.

Speaker 3:          01:57:45       You guys get in little friendly arguments and it's go time. You wrestle in the yard or in the living room. Then you went to in a seal platoon, so you want to, it's on. Exactly right. And your parents say, hey, take it outside. It's all this thing he gets from fight. I'll sit in the grass or the dirt, whatever. And you know who big fights usually. Sometimes. Yeah, usually the bigger brother or you know your friend who's bigger, usually he's going to get you right. But it's fun. That's how it always, it's all fun and maybe you lose your temper, maybe fight whatever, all the little brother that can't take care of the kids and he tries to like kick you in the nuts, like, you know what I mean? And you know what I mean? That kid, I didn't know. It gets all red in the face, bad temper, got to look out for himself, wants to project the power, even though he's smaller than everyone else because younger, sure. That happens occasionally and which actually fits into what I'm about to say. So what Jujitsu is, it's basically that, but the skill that, that that's required to win it, that, you know, so we still have that need like me and you right now, your whole point is to say that just do fun. Yes. Yeah. Agreed. Okay. So now you've got to unpack it because it's like, you can see there's a lot of things that are fun.

Speaker 3:          01:58:56       The thing is, but they didn't know what kind of fun, you know. So if I say, hey, um, you know, actually it's more fun than that. Well, here's the fun. It's fun in a whole different level. Right. Well hear this though because it's fun because you're connecting things together that are part of a like grand, right? It's like being a musician. It's like, Hey, here's the ref. Well, yes there's that 100% but I think just as a fundamental kind of, I don't want to say need but want is like bro, like see how you're even looking at me right now, like where I kind of want to fight you right now.

Speaker 3:          01:59:30       I don't want to like fight you like, but I kind of want to fight you as a friend. Like do you want to take it on the match right now? Kind of thing. Like if we're like 10 years old, he'd be like, what? You want to take it outside and throw you as friends? But that's all did you get to really is that's really what it is. It's like, yeah, let's go on the mat and let's basically fight in a way that we don't burn our each other's bridges and not be friends anymore. And then, but on top of that, it's like they teach you the skill to do that. That can literally save your life. Oh yeah. Literally at a minimum it will increase your confidence as a human, as a human being. Yes sir. Sometimes it gives you too much cost. Too much.

Speaker 3:          02:00:10       Yes. Especially early on, especially if you're 13, 15, 21, 20 [inaudible] you start thinking you could just smash everybody nonetheless. So if you're training Jujitsu when you change it, well if you're on the path, that might be good too. If you need you to gear, which you do need some Jujitsu gear, you need it what's called a [inaudible]. If you need to g you can get a [inaudible] from our company, which is based here in America. And we make gies all American from the ground up from the dirt through it's called origin main, best [inaudible] ever in the world to ever, ever in the history. And if you need rash guards, which you can use for Jujitsu, you can also use them for weightlifting. You can use them for running and cycling, cycling, surfing, uh, guitar playing. It might not have, might not be necessary. I do not wear rash guard when I play guitar.

Speaker 3:          02:01:10       Maybe I should maybe and those are also made here in America along with what else? Just regular clothes too, like shirts and you know some athletic wear but the shorts that I wear, I only wear, well I have one pair of like random, I'm old shorts. Oh by the way, I'm going to get you some, we got some new shorts coming and you're going to be very excited about these shorts. Well I already am because every sin, even the error, the mistake shorts that they made when they were my favorite shirts literally ever. And then they came out with deliberate that they can actually

Speaker 1:          02:01:39       sell. Not No, those are my favorite shorts. So yeah you say it or because he know, I bet Pete he cares. You don't care about the fashion stuff but they fashion subtleties. Nothing to do with fit, fit style. But it's subtle though. Anyway, they got a bunch of stuff on there, a clothing wise as well, like joggers and and you like the joggers and then they got supplements. We got supplements. Sure. We got supplements. We've got joint warfare. We got do you want word for is good. If you're working out, if you're on the path, your joints are going to take a beating. Joint Warfare will protect them and heal them. A krill oil. Another good one. Discipline. Good. Pre-Operational get some, get your mind right real quick. Get your body right. And then of course we have a little something called Malke. Yes sir. We do.

Speaker 1:          02:02:29       What is milk? Really simple. It's smoke. Smoke. Yeah. So you know, um, you know, coa. The kid, yeah. Happens to be my cousin. He's on the path. Oh, the beginnings of the path taking the first step. Trustingly got on the multi train as the first step. That's an interesting, interesting. But here's why though, when you're not really technically on the path and you just drink Mulkey just think you're drinking a milkshake. See what I'm saying it for the taste. And that's a point. Which is good though because it will keep you on the path in regards to that additional protein that you're going to get. The original flavor was mint chocolate. My favorite. We went to peanut butter from there available then vanilla gorilla. I don't like plain vanilla. I don't, I just don't like, I don't want to, I don't want to eat vanilla anything like you unless, unless I'm meeting with some damn chocolate cake.

Speaker 1:          02:03:26       I'm not going to order vanilla ice cream ever. The other day when you had a cake situation, cake scenario in some ice cream and ice cream, it was vanilla. There you go. And that whole scenario, just on the folded wrong, it really did. I just rationalized the whole thing. Lied to myself. Just again, just got after it. But what? Well here's what bummed me out. As soon as I was done I was like, well I was on the road, no milk. So when you don't have dessert, sometimes you get that little, oh, I'd like a little something that tastes good too to wash down the stake. That's a good state. And then, and then there's no milk cause I'm on the road. I got to figure that out. I got to figure that out. People give me good suggestions. I know I can put a little baggy in the thing.

Speaker 1:          02:04:09       And just grab some milk somewhere, mix it up, no factor. So I need to start doing that. Uh, nonetheless. You don't like vanilla, so no vanilla is not my favorite flavor. The Vanilla tastes good. I was not the judge on the vanilla. You know, Pete and Brian were like a, the is awesome. I said I'll try it. It tastes fine. I'm not the judge cause I don't want to judge something that I don't fully comprehend. I'm not deserving of being a vanilla judge. So therefore I didn't do it. And, but the darkness, which is chocolate, the darkness that is also freaking delicious. And when you're getting this stuff, you'll be getting it from origin main. You got to Cindy up there. You met Cindy. Of course she's fired up. So when you're getting your stuff packed, it's not just being, it's not just being randomly placed in a box by a robot.

Speaker 1:          02:05:05       No, Cindy's up there. She's getting after it. And I'm going to say one more thing. Little announced announcement. Little announcement. So you, you remember when you were a little kid? Yes. And you loved chocolate milk? Yes. And he loves strawberry milk being loved it so much, whatever, whatever little brand name that you got. And there was a couple of them that were prominent and they tasted delicious and it was like desert. And for some reason you didn't really understand why, but your parents would actually allow you to drink it all the time because your parents thought, well you know, it's kind of milking it so it's gotta be good to go. It'll make their bones strong and just a little protein in there, so we'll just let them drink it. What they didn't realize is that little chocolate and strawberry milk that you were drinking as a kid is completely filled with sugar and high fructose corn syrup and a bunch of other chemicals that they couldn't even pronounce. And so the milk that your parents, my parents were allowing me to drink was actually a freaking net loss overall to my health because it was filled with poison, but it tasted good and you loved it. It was like a dessert you could have all the time, but it was filled with poison. So you know, we did, we fixed it. We fixed it and we now have available at this time warrior kid.

Speaker 1:          02:06:31       Yes, Warrior kid milk. We made chocolate and we made strawberry. Just like you remember when you were a kid only instead of having a bunch of garbage in it, it's got protein, extra protein, 12 grams. It's got vitamins that you need. It's got probiotics because kids are getting told all the time they, their parents are getting told they need to take probiotics and here take this pill and that pill, no take warrior kid moke and there's no sugar in it and it tastes freaking amazing. So it's better than any other of these flavored whatever chocolate milk you grew up on, this taste better. So now your or your kid out there can get on the milk train. It's awesome. And again, for me to see kids and be able to help out kids that are four years old, six years old, eight years old, to give them something that's healthy, that tastes good, that's going to make them stronger and healthier. I mean this is what it's all about. So

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       order up some warrior kid milk for your children available. Now my kid's going straight on the mock trial. Yeah, for sure. One way ticket. Does that apply when we take it on? Yeah. Yeah. You understand what it was to totally fully the Vanessa. Speaking of which my son, two years old, by the way, I liked the vanilla as more. I didn't know. I'm like, should I give my son that much additional protein? You know, you even questioned that. I just don't know a lot of things, you know as far in regards to either way, so, okay. Yes. Kids on milk train on the path. Kids are on the path. Yes. Straight and want to be at that book signing there. There wasn't many. There weren't many kids. They're the ones that I did on the east coast. Lots of kids in, tons of kids. All of them on the path fired up, man.

Speaker 3:          02:08:28       It was, it was amazing. Every kid there last night at was not in the path. Huge time. One kid literally tried to challenge me to a Jujitsu match on more than one occasion and I'm not even joking like for real attitude, which I dug by the way. I mean I couldn't engage them cause you know, I mean you're getting all this challenge me double get away. Okay. Kids on the vessel, which brings me to our uh, store Jocko has a store, it's called Jocko store. Right. Pretty straight forward. Anyway, there is, there are where your kid rash guards for when they joined Jujitsu. No Geek part of it. Rash guards on there. There's obviously where he could shirts if they're in the geek part of it. That's cool. You got to origin main.com and you get him, you get him the warrior [inaudible] get some boom and also new edition for where are your kids patches on there right now if you went literally right now you live eye patches for your g for your backpack, obviously, wherever you want to put it.

Speaker 3:          02:09:30       But yeah, the little round one and long kind of Jujitsu and made kind of four digits you, but you can put it wherever want anyway. Yeah. It's on [inaudible] dot com also on Jocko store.com is where you can get your shirts, disciplining freedom. This is one of the thing about shirts is everyone wears shirts. Yes. Even if you don't want to wear one, which I don't like wearing a shirt. Hell no, but I you sometimes you got to wear a shirt. Everyone needs a shirt. Might as well be you. Kind of a cool one. Might as little reminders. Yeah, big time and truckers hats. Chuck has hands on them. Just completely stoked on my discipline equals freedom hat or the def core hats out yet the difficult cats are should be done. Are they live? I don't know. Okay. I got there was, there was a technical thing where like the logo and get, you know, cause hats have panels, a certain amount of panels and you know the logo. Does it fit on this dis, does it go on the scene or do we need a different panel hat now anyway, it's very tactical. Well, but nonetheless the DEF core hat is out soon. That's deep representing right there.

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       What about the deaf court shirt? Is there a pure def course shirt? Black cops. Ah, yes. And then

Speaker 3:          02:10:41       I was thinking a one called def core declassified. It's just white on white, whatever. Black out. You see what I'm saying? Anyway? Well, you know. Yeah. You know, I'm going to have to ask that. We all kind of just kinda checked back on that one. Maybe it's like maybe it's not none the less. If you go there and you want to represent hardcore, that's where you can get your shirt or Hoodie new hoodie on the way, by the way. Oh yeah. Duty heavy duty, heavy duty techniques.

Speaker 1:          02:11:11       This better be good. That's the thing.

Speaker 3:          02:11:14       Anyway, hoodies on there. A lot of cool stuff on there. Oh, and I did the research. Who, what? What's better? What do people literally, what do people like better? Flex fit hat. Oh, trucker hat. Even even Steven. Okay, cool. Actually there's like, I think two more people historically speaking like the snap back,

Speaker 1:          02:11:32       so technically you're right. Yes. Nonetheless. We've got some rash guards in there as well. Also, we got on the podcast, subscribe to it wherever. No, don't forget the warrior kid podcast. A lot of people don't know about that yet. So spread the word on the warrior kid podcast will questions from uncle Jake for Uncle Jake and little stories from Uncle Jake about how he developed his sort of values in the world. That's the warrior kid bond cast, the warrior kids soap from Irish oaks ranch.com at young Aden, the warrior kid milking goats, making soap, getting after it, order some of that so you can stay clean. Also youtube checkout echos, legit enhanced videos, which some people like some people like them. Most people I'd say like you don't get a lot of thumbs down on your videos. Yeah, the annual, what I like is when someone funds down your video, there's, there's multiple people in the comments that'll be like, Ooh, well down this aisle communist.

Speaker 1:          02:12:43       So that's good. We've got some plans for the youtube going to step it up a little bit. Yeah, a little bit more I should say, cause he was stepped it up a little bit. Yeah, we're gonna step it up a little bit more. Yeah. I think videos just in general are like fun to watch and it could be just speaking for myself, but I would tend to agree with you and also psychological warfare working on album number two, psychological warfare. We're aiming for a Christmas release. If you have any suggestions, hit me up on Twitter. In the meantime, you got the psychological warfare one album, which can help you get through whatever little moments of weakness. I wish I had it the other day for that cake and my brain with ice cream to watch out for that.

Speaker 3:          02:13:22       It was good about that. You learn, it seemed like anyway, according to your post and you that you learned a little lesson and you're open about it too. Yeah. That's good. Yeah. It can't be like hiding your failures in an actor like no, cause I'm saying because I'm human. Yeah. Yeah. Anyone that thinks I'm not human, you're wrong. I'm all too human. I get tapped out in Jujitsu I get and what? You know what I mean? I mean it's like, yeah, hey and you pound huge pieces of the cake. We every once in awhile cake with ice cream. So disappointed in myself any way. Stay on the path is what I'm saying. I'm also, if you're, if you're incorporating kettle bell workouts in various ring workouts, I'll tell you where you can get them. Get them from on it on it.com/jocko by the way, I incorporate rings every single day.

Speaker 3:          02:14:14       Every single day. You're all on the ring for ads and core power. It's good and I can't quite, I can almost do pull ups again. Oh look my bicep or whatever. But muscle ups coming to Muslims coming in action. Know that honestly my shoulders getting back up to speed. Yeah. Cause it went through a little down period. Then it got, then it got the healed. Now that I tweaked it again doing something stupid. You know what I did? Yeah. I eat ice cream. That's good. You know I didn't do that. I edit a massive numbers of weighted dips super deep and in a mess up you shoulder messed up my shoulder. Oh okay. That was, that was like six months ago or something. And he was a long time ago dealing with it. But finally it's coming back around. Yeah. And shoulders pain in the ass, man.

Speaker 3:          02:14:53       Yeah. You've got to make do the maintenance man and you've got to do the maintenance and I don't do enough of it. Need to do more of it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, go there. That's the, you can get some cool workout stuff and actually good travel workout stuff too. Like those written, well you already said this. I know, but I'm slowly come to the realization that you, when you travel with rings but opens up your whole travel game changer. Game Changer. You know if you're working out too, when you're working on that dead lift, one thing you can do is if you probably, if you're stuck at like a 4,000 pound dead lift plateau, no, we can't accept that. Get Jocko white tea and it comes with a guarantee. I don't know what kind of guarantee. So you can deadlift 8,000 pounds immediately. Probably take you like four sips.

Speaker 3:          02:15:36       Yeah. If you can't define, if you can't deadlift 8,000 pounds after drinking Jocko white tea, either the ones in a can or the ones in a teabag, uh, that you can get them on Amazon. If you can't think your deadlift isn't 8,000 pounds after that, just drink more and you'll get there. Yes. Also got some books. Obviously the way the warrior kid books that the first one way of the warrior kid. The second one is Mark's mission, which is the best book. And I'm going, if I'm going to say it, I'm going to say it's a bold statement and in fact I was debating whether or not to actually say it out loud. That's the best book in the world. Straight up March mission mission. The second one.

Speaker 3:          02:16:16       You okay. So I'm reading it to buy, we've just finished it a week ago. Oh is this your first time finishing it? Finishing it yet. Okay. Well we could. Interesting. Interesting. So, um, well cause we jumped around to another book and it's a long story, but nonetheless. Yeah. So finished it. Right. So you know why though now that I'm searching my feelings, it starts to address a little bit more sophisticated issues that you can go through. You know, even though when you think you got it figured out, you know, you're taking Jujitsu now and you can do pull ups and all this stuff or what are you sort of address those a little bit more advanced issues. Sophisticated but like the depth of which like these issues go and the way you got to solve them or like the way it's simplified in broken down to kids or to whoever's reading it because quite frankly it's broken down to me in this case, um, is like, it's pretty, we'll just say it's pretty interesting, but at the same time it, you glorify things like hard work, right?

Speaker 3:          02:17:15       In a way that it actually makes the kid want to work hard. You know what I'm saying? So it's like, yeah, getting a job, like go mow lawns and pull weeds by the way, which if we, you know, we all know that when you did that as a kid, you're like, no bro, we don't want to do that. Is a form of punishment. Yeah. And my house exactly right. This time after reading that part, um, my daughter, by the way, she wants to pull weeds. She's, she's salty cause she doesn't have a job mowing lawns and pulling weeds. Yeah. And he makes work for, he's like, he's like $40. I made $40. Right. Like exclamation point. She's like, oh my gosh, you made $40. I want to make $40. You know, just the way it's laid out, how simple. But you know, I'm really, I'm getting into it and it, I see it affecting it, um, my daughter.

Speaker 3:          02:17:57       So then it moves onto the Jujitsu part and this part affected me. You know, it's like, well let's face it. That's why when you get nervous in Jujitsu with tournaments or whatever, like there was a, I remember when I was competing and strangely I was competing a lot too. Like maybe two, three weeks. There was a tournament back then. Wasn't as often as no, but, um, and I would be competing, but every single one seems like we're driving there. And if like my wife who was, I think my girlfriend at the time, um, and my brother, whoever was driving it was, if they're talking about other stuff, I'm like getting mad at him cause I'm like told, you realize man, it's like that idea, you know? And I'm like, I don't behave that way. But that's what's been on my mind and tangible. Small but tangible part of my mind is like hoping that like the Jim Burke down when we got there, like I just don't want to, you know, it's like that, it's weird.

Speaker 3:          02:18:46       But then the way like you lay out because mark didn't want to compete in a tournament. Right. And the way you lay out and you really, it's a call out is what it is. It's like you're calling out. He's like, I'm afraid. But it's like you're not afraid of Jujitsu. You do Jiu Jitsu every day, full speed by the way. And you're not afraid of juice. You're afraid of losing. And guess what? Those things, okay. It really hit me anyways. And then from there to me from then on it was like, and how it culminate has good man. It's straight out the best book in the world. I'll give it to you. Don't want to, but nevermind. Cormac McCarthy, nevermind about where the warrior king, they also got the discipline equals freedom field manual. How to get after it for adults.

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       And actually a lot of kids read this book. That's where they graduate. They graduate from Warrior Kid. I talked to a lot of parents and they're like, oh yeah, once you know, now he's 14 he just read discipline equals freedom field manual. So that's the, that's the graduate. Can Imagine if you had that book when you were 14 game changer, game changer. Right. Anyone, and I'll tell you right now the warrior, that one, yeah, yeah. No, the feedback that I get from it, but the, it's the same kind of feedback I get from the kids, from the field manual of people that are like, hey, I read this every day. I read two pages this every day so I can keep my mind right. Yeah. That, and that's how that works. Like that's the one you refer it back to everyday or every other day or whatever. That's their guy.

Speaker 1:          02:20:14       Hit me up on Twitter. Remember that story I told about being a Yosemite and the dude was in the river and he's like, I was like, oh. He recognized me and I was getting all fired up with him and he was like, I'm here to get my mind right. I was like, year. Anyways, guys, friend hit me up on Twitter and that dude's name is meth. That's his name. His name is math. Math, math. I. M. E. T. H. Like the dried up. Yeah. Got It. Well, he was not a meth user. It just happens to be his name. Gotcha. Uh, okay. Then also extreme ownership. Obviously that's the first book wrote with my brother Leif Babin and we followed that book up very recently with a book called the dichotomy of leadership.
