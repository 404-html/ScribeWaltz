Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 48 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink.

Speaker 2:          00:00:10       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:00:13       We found general Custer on the bluffs and near him lay the bodies of 11 of his officers as a tribute to his bravery. The Indians had not mutilated general Custer and he lay as if asleep, but all the other men had been most brutally mangled and had been stripped of their clothing.

Speaker 2:          00:00:37       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:00:38       Many of their skulls had been crushed in eyes, had been torn from their sockets, hands, feet, arms, legs, and noses had been wrenched off. Many had their flesh cut in strips the entire length of their bodies and there were others whose limbs were closely perforated with bullet holes showing that the torture had been inflicted while the wretched victims were yet alive. There were 29 enlisted men missing from the field of blood and they undoubtedly had been taken prisoners and perished at the steak while the Indians were celebrating their scalp dance on the night of the 25th in sight of my camp, mine almost at Custer's feet was young. Read a nephew of the generals who had been visiting him at Fort Lincoln and who had pleaded to go on the campaign where this handsome lad of 19 met such an untimely fate within a few feet of the general lay, his two brothers, Boston and Tom. There wasn't a whole army, no more popular man than gallon. Tom Custer. He was young, handsome, a prince of good fellows and full of that bravery that even characterized the coasters.

Speaker 1:          00:02:05       He had served with distinction during the war and it fought frequently before, been engaged in Indian fights. As we approached him, we were horrified to see that his body had been opened in his heart torn out. Thus, I know that the vengeance of rain in the face had been at work several years before. Rain in the face had murdered two white men on of our forte and afterwards boasted of it in the reservation. He was arrested and brought to trial by Tom Koster, but before the time appointed for his case at arrived, the wily Indian had escaped sending back word to captain Tom that he would be revenged by cutting out his captors heart.

Speaker 2:          00:02:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:51       Rain in the face kept his word by literally tearing out the heart of young Tom Koster near these three brothers and they're boyish nephew lay there brother-in-law, lieutenant Calhoun, who had fallen on the skirmish line. Costumers command was completely annihilated, not one of his men escaping. Good Evening Echo. Good evening, not right. There is an excerpt from a book called, I fought with Custer, which is the story of Charles Wind off who was a young private that fought with one of the other companies in the same Seventh Cavalry Regiment. That general George Custer led general George Custer, who was killed at the battle of little big horn where he fought the native Americans, including our friend wouldn't leg or we heard from on podcasts 45 but the opening section that I just read wasn't actually written by pro private wind off it is a section of an account that is written by a guy named major reno who was one of the leaders of one of the other companies have men at the battle that they include in this book. This book called by fought with customer and this was obviously a brutal battle. And my goal as always, I shouldn't say is always put my goal.

Speaker 2:          00:04:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:41       Well where I like to focus is not so much on what details happen in the battle, but what details happened with the human nature in the battle, the people, the leadership, the decisions. And we got some good understanding about the native American perspective from wooden leg. But now let's hear a little bit of what it was like for the troopers. And I know I use that term on a fairly regular basis, but that is a very specific term.

Speaker 2:          00:05:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:22       In a cavalry unit,

Speaker 1:          00:05:25       this, and at this time a cavalry unit was literally units that they ride horses, you know, that's what it is. Mounted Cavalry, a soldier in a calvary unit is specifically called a trooper. And the word nowadays, it, it actually is used to cover a lot of different people. You know, armored units use it, airborne units. You know, when you think of an airborne unit parachuters, you think of a paratrooper, trooper being the key word there. Obviously there's police state troopers. And then obviously there's people that listen to this podcast, but that is what we have here. The cavalry unit, and this in particular was the Seventh Cavalry Regiment and the trooper, like I said, is this guy private Charles wind off who's actually born in Germany and emigrated to the United States. He became a cobbler like his dad knew what a cobbler is. People fix shoes. People who fix shoes and you know what, he fixed shoes for awhile, but he didn't like fixing shoes, so what do you do? Join the army and he ended up fighting in some of the Indian wars. He actually received the medal of honor for his actions at little big horn and we'll get into those, but let's hear what private wind off has to say.

Speaker 1:          00:06:59       I'm going to the book, June 25th, 1946 was the last time I saw him alive. Two days later I looked down on him lying in the white in the Montana son. That would have been June 27th, 1876 and the following day I helped him. I helped bury him and his brother, Captain Tom Koster. They were putting in graves alongside one another. It was hard digging there on that high ridge that bordered little big horn. It's a long time to remember details and little things, but when you've been thinking back on them all those years, they don't fade away as easily as you might think. They're like burrs. They stick in your mind. People call it the Koster massacre. It wasn't any massacre. It was a straight hard fight and the five troops who were with Costa simply got cut to ribbons and every last white man destroyed. I say every last white man because there were one or two crow scouts who claim they saw the start of the fight and then skedaddled a crow Indian named curly said he escaped from the battlefield by putting a blanket over his head and pretending he was a wounded sue.

Speaker 2:          00:08:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:26       I don't know whether there's any truth in that or not. I never quite believed it. There's been all kinds of stories about that battle. Even the men who were with Ben Teen and Reno and live to tell the tale didn't come anywhere near telling the same stories about what they did and what they saw. Some of them wanted to make heroes out of themselves or of their officers. I only had one pair of eyes, so of course all I can tell is what I saw myself. If it is something that I only heard, I'll be sure to mark it down as that.

Speaker 1:          00:09:04       Interestingly, this is something that we used to see all the time in that you go out on an operation and when things happen to guys, almost nobody will see the same thing. Everybody sees some things a little bit different and it can be difficult to figure out what's actually accurate. So that's, and he's, he's going back when he's writing this book, I think it's been 70 years. So when he's being interviewed and he's writing this book, it's been 70 years and he's saying he still remembers the details, but 70 years is a long time, long time. And the characters that he just brought up, Ben teen is a guy that he worked for and Reno was one of the other majors. And another word that they use here is truth. Now this is a word that's, we think of it as an individual. Hey, there's a trooper over there or that there's a troop.

Speaker 1:          00:09:55       It actually, it actually is another term that means basically like a company of guys. Now you can see it small and this is more like a platoon. What they're talking about would be considered a platoon, I would say from reading. Um, he had five troops with him. Koster did that got killed, you know, call. How about 200 guys? And so we're not talking about a massive group of people in each troop, but that's what they're talking about. 20 guys per trooper actually. What'd that be? 40 guys per troop for five. And so that's what they're talking when they refer to the troops. And even they use the word interchangeably and sometimes they'll refer to as companies and sometimes they say troops. Yeah. So um, guilt going back to the book here when he's an initially in the army and what they're doing and he talks about what they were doing at this time. It was pretty dull soldiering down there in the south, the regiment was broken up into companies or small battalions and our job was to smash the Klu Klux Klan and run down elicit whiskey distillers. It wasn't much fun for energetic spirited young men.

Speaker 1:          00:11:08       And now he's going to talk a little bit about the seventh cavalry. As I say, the seventh cavalry was only seven years old in 1873 but it had a fine reputation. Everybody in the country knew general Custer

Speaker 1:          00:11:22       and Andy and he was always bragging about what a fine fighting regimen he had. He was supposed to be the best Indian fighter in the American army in the civil war. They'd called them the boy general and he'd been a dashing, popular figure. The regimen had spent its first four years of its life on the Kansas Plains and an Indian Indian territory. The old timers in the outfit could sure tell some blood curling Indian stories. They used to say that it was worse straight death to get captured by the Indians because you would be slowly tortured until you gave up the ghost. They told all of us young soldiers, if we were ever wounded in an Indian fight and left behind and endanger of being captured, that we must save our last cartridge to blow out our brains. So that's an interesting point. When we remember, wouldn't leg said that all the guys in costers group ended up killing themselves and maybe that's that. That very well might have happened or at least some of them. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:34       Back to the book. By the spring of 1873 the plains Indians had been largely debased, beaten, and driven to the great reservations that have been allotted to the various tribes. It had not been a deliberate government policy, but it had been cruelly, but had been a cruelly effective one. Treaty after treaty had been broken by the relentless pressure of white men and their civilization constantly pushing against the ineffective resistance of the red men. Now, when again, the Indians had struck back and as a rule, they're angry, angry, flare ups were put down by the army, and then new and drastic treaties would be made and more land taken from them in punishment. The ink would hardly be dry on these new government commitments before the white pressure would be resumed. Intrusions made. And once again, the bewildered, enraged Indians would strike back only to be subdued by the army and harsh penalties imposed on them. It was a deadly and vicious cycle. The Indian found himself whirling endlessly in.

Speaker 1:          00:13:41       So that's reminds me of a lot of conflicts where you have, you have these things happen. You know the, the, the white man is putting pressure on the Indians. The Indians don't know what's going on, so they lash out a little bit. What are the white man do then go in there, smash them, take more land from them, compress the more. Eventually there's another lash out and you just get this vicious cycle, vicious cycle. In 1864, uh, uh, certain kernel Shillington with a regimen of volunteer Colorado Cav cavalry had suddenly moved against a large encampment of Cheyanne's and indiscriminately killed some 300 Indians. The massacre unquestionably had turned many Luke warm Indians into out and out hostiles. This bitterness of the Cheyanne's was inflamed. Two or three years later when costs are led, his newly formed seventh cavalry against the black kettle and his band in a sudden attack against their sleeping village on Washita in Texas, the Cheyanne's who are recognized as the most brilliant Indian fighters of the planes never forgave either Custer or his seventh cavalry for this whirling attack on their sleeping village in the dead of winter.

Speaker 1:          00:15:11       Oh, another big. Yeah. So, uh, you know, atrocities on both sides, clearly, I'll talk a little bit about those as well. But one of the biggest atrocities beyond the killing of the Indians themselves, that native Americans themselves and those types of atrocities was what they did with the buffalos because the white man was coming and killing all the buffaloes. And I'll go to the book here. Once the buffalo around whose existence the whole economy of the Indian was based, was killed off the nomads, had nothing to do but submit to government control and become agency Indians, degraded whiskey crazed and beaten only the various tribes of the Su and the fighting Cheyenne is refused to be broken on the wheel of civilization. A few determine leaders such as sitting bull, crazy horse, gall American horse to moon, white bull spotted eagle and chief honk. Stubbornly held out against the threats and blandishments of the whites.

Speaker 1:          00:16:17       But by the spring of 1873 they were beginning to be branded as hostiles. So that's something that I didn't focus on enough. When I talked about how the Sioux and the Cheyenne kind of faded well, one of the main reasons that they faded was, you know, again, they gave up their guns at a certain point, but we, the white man had decimated the buffaloes. And so that was their main way of survival. If you remember from wooden leg, that's where they lived. They lived in shelters that were made from buffalo skins and obviously they ate buffalo all the time. They hunted buffalo, they ate them. They made their weapons out of Buffalo. Everything that they did was with Buffalo. Yeah, so when the white man came in and killed all the buffalo, that put them in a, in a real precarious situation.

Speaker 1:          00:17:08       Now we go back to the book talking to a little bit about what it was like being the cavalry at this time. Each man would look after his own horse and we'd usually give him a little exercise and a good rub down. A trooper thought a lot of his mouth at a cavalry, men would have to be a pretty mean. It would have to be pretty mean. Who didn't take good care of his horse. If we got a good chance, we'd steal them. A little extra oats or hay for individual mounts. My horse at this time was named pig. That wasn't his real name, but I called him that because nothing could keep him from rolling in a mud hole when he was being watered. After we'd come in from a long ride. He was fast and he could show his heels to most of the horses and the regimen.

Speaker 1:          00:17:52       I fought a lot of them, but the army condemned him after we'd been beaten in the Dakota country. A year or two after we'd been in the Dakota country, a year or two, I'll tell you later about the horse. I rode in the battle of little big horn, but one more thing about pig. Two or three years after the army sold him, I saw him in a contractor, six horse team and the black hills. He looked so porn abused. I'd have bought them from that contractor on the spot, but I didn't have the money. I went up to him and tested him. He knew me. All right. He nickered and looked at me as much to say, come on please Charlie, get me out of here. I had written old pig thousands of miles and more than once, he had saved my life at pretty near cried when I saw him. That time in the black hills. Big Connection and you know, we see that nowadays with the guys that work with dogs and the the military working dogs, which are awesome animals and those guys get major connect, majorly connected to those dogs. So she's like horse where it's just, there's a lot of times where it's just you and him in the, in the first year writing situation, you know, it's just you and him. It's like Dang, you go through so much together, up stones and then for sure you could, I can't even imagine the emotion of that situation. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:15       Back to the book, it was at the Yankton that I first saw general Custer. He was not far from six feet tall. He must have weighed around 180 pounds. He was energetic and it was mighty hard to wear him out. I've heard people say that when he was at West Point, he was the second strongest man there. As I remember him at the time, he was wearing long hair or something like buffalo bill used to where you had a big wide Brynn, western hat and long military mustache, his hair and mustache where yellow Tawney colored. I suppose would be the right way to describe them. He had on high Willington boots, they were the kind that came up to the knees with the front three or four inches higher than the back. They were popular among officers at the time. General customer wasn't the kind to mix freely with the men. In those years there was quite a gulf between the officers and the enlisted men. Some of the officers were friendly and easy going with their troopers, but there was always a Gulf Kuster struck me as being aloof and removed.

Speaker 1:          00:20:25       No did it got to be gossip among the troopers that some of the officers didn't set so very well with the general, my captain, Colonel Ben Teen. So there's something that nurses like, I got to point this out. Some of these including general Custer, these guys had been promoted during the civil war. It's so general become a general during the civil war, but after the war they got demoted. They got put back down in rank cause they shrank the armies, they shrank the army. And so for instance, general Custer at this time was he had been a general in the civil war. Now all of a sudden he's a colonel, so he'd got put down in rank and it's the same with, he's talking about his boss. Um, uh, uh, wind offs. Boss Windows boss was a guy named captain Ben Teen, but they call him colonel bending cause he was a colonel during civil war. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:21:20       my captain Colonel Benton was one of those folks who didn't belong to the generals inner circle, I suppose you could say about half the officers in the regiment, we're close to Costa and the rest were not. I repeat that Ben teen was not distinct, was distinctly not an intimate of Custer. I heard all sorts of reasons why that was true. There was one report that Ben teen, it turned bitter because Costa had pulled out after the battle of the washy, didn't December, 1868 in Kansas and it left a major Elliot and 17 men to their fate. A day or two later they were all found, killed, scalped and mutilated. There was a story that Custer and Ben Teen had some hard words over that, but of course, I don't know how true that old story is.

Speaker 1:          00:22:09       So there you go. Ben Teen thought custard, let some guys hanging out to dry, had confronted him about it and cost or didn't like that at all, and now they got some stuff that they're at odds about. And speaking of that event where these 17 men were killed in this book, they have an exer that's a letter from an army officer that got published in a newspaper about that event, and I'm going to read it. The bodies were found in a small circle, stripped as naked as wind born and frozen, stiff. Their heads had been battered in and some of them had been entirely chopped off. Some of them had the Adam's apple cut out of their throats. Some had their hands and feet caught off and nearly all had been horribly mangled in a way. Delicacy forbids me to mention.

Speaker 2:          00:23:08       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:23:09       they lay scarcely two miles from the scene of the fight.

Speaker 2:          00:23:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:14       Who can describe the feeling of that brave band? As with anxious hearts beating, they strained their yearning eyes in the direction of whence the help should come. What must've been the despair that when all hopes of soccer died out nerve, they're stout arms to do and die round and round rush. The red feens smaller and smaller shrinks the circle. But the aim of that devoted gallon not of heroes is steadier than ever and the death. How of the murderous red skin is more frequent, but on a calm and masses grim with glittering lance and one long loud exalting whoop as if the gates of hell had opened and loose the whole infernal host.

Speaker 3:          00:24:08       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:24:08       well directed volley from their trustee carbines make some of the miscreants real and fall, but their death rattles are drowned in the greater den.

Speaker 3:          00:24:17       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:24:18       Soon every voice in that little band is steel is death, but the hellish work of the savages is scarce begun and their engine newies are taxed to invent barbarities to practice on the bodies of the fallen brave.

Speaker 3:          00:24:40       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:24:41       Some psychological warfare going on there. You clearly, we know that the troopers at this time do. You don't want to get captured by the Indians. And the reason that they think that is events like this mutilated bodies, everyone had killed. No quarter given.

Speaker 1:          00:25:03       Now going to what some of the other officers were like, I'm gonna talk about Captain Ben Teen. Here's what captain Benton was like back to the book. Most of the time we were in the field. Captain venting commanded a squadron. Usually you'd have one or two companies besides his own h company. He was a wonderful officer. He let the first sergeant pretty much run the company. Hmm. Little decentralized command going on. He wasn't always interfering and running the details, so he wasn't getting in the weeds. He wasn't a micromanager. I served under Ben Team for 12 full years, lacking only throws three days. One of the best descriptions of Captain Benton is that penned by the late major general Hugh l Scott on page 454 of his interesting book, some memoirs of a soldier.

Speaker 1:          00:25:57       I found my model early in captain Ben Teen, the idol of the seventh cavalry on the Upper Missouri in 1877 who governed mainly by suggestion. In all the years I knew him, I never once heard him raise his voice to enforce his purpose. Think about that. Never once heard him raise his voice to enforce his purpose. He would sit by the open fire at night, his bright, pleasant face framed by a snow white hair beaming with kindness and humor, and often watched often I watched his every movement to find out the secret of his quiet, steady government that I might go and govern. Likewise, for example, if he to stay a few days in one camp, he would say to his adjutant, brewer, don't you think we had better take up our regular guard Mount Wallen camp? And brewer always thought it better and so did everyone else. If he found this kindly manner, manner was misunderstood, then his iron hand would close quickly down. But that was seldom necessary. And then only with newcomers and never twice with the same person. So this is just complete example of indirect leadership. Hey, don't you hey, echo, do anything to be good. If we're going to stay in this camp, we should put our, our camp guards out. Hm. What do you think? Of course. There you go. So you make it happen. I didn't give you an order. I actually let you get, get some ownership of it. It's actually now your decision. Not even my decision anymore. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:27:36       that's a really good example of some solid leadership.

Speaker 3:          00:27:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:42       Here's what it was like to be in the cavalry. It was wonderful to be young and to be riding into Indian country as part of the finest regimen of cavalry in the world. We, we're mighty proud of the seventh. It just didn't seem like anything could ever happen to it.

Speaker 1:          00:28:04       Now I'm going to go through there. They're riding out there, they're working the plains, and I'm going to go through a little battle on the planes were customers and charge general George Custer's in charge. The general started, so did the Indians. They had a good start in general cost of resolve not to pursue them too far away from his men after a sharp short race. He stopped on the plane keeping well away from the suspicious woods. When he stopped, the Indian stopped. It was evident that they would not be so audacious without a conscious, without a consciousness of strength somewhere for ways that are dark and tricks that are vain. The even sue is almost as peculiar as the heathen. Cheney and I actually had to go in and do a little research on that one. There's a poem that it's about Chinese migrant workers and interested.

Speaker 1:          00:29:05       You can go and read about this poem. It's called the heathen shiny. And if you read the poem, you realize that he's trying to describe that they're playing cards with the, a couple of the people working on the train or plane cars or the Chinese guy, and as they're playing cards, they're, they're kind of treating the Chinese guy like he's ignorant, but he's actually winning. And when they accused him of cheating, there's a fight. And he was actually the white guy that was cheating one of the other white guys that was cheating. So the guy that wrote the poem had the poem with the intention of showing, Hey, these people are smart and they're trustworthy, but because of the name it got red and misinterpreted a lot. The title of the poem. Yep. Yeah. Then shiny, not a very positive positive neighbor. At least that's kind of what I did some very quick research on that just to figure it out what is all about and that's sort of what I gathered after a quick uh,

Speaker 3:          00:30:07       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:08       Quick research meaning I googled it and read a few articles to figure out what was going on in um, in Hawaiian Pidgin. When we see Japanese we say Japanese. Portuguese is put Aggie Chinese, Chinese man, right. Be So maybe based on relationship connection there. All right. Back to the book. This time the trick was indeed vein. They were fighting with no novice. As soon as general Custer saw the Indian dodge, which was to use these men as a decoy to draw them into the woods, he immediately sent his orderly back to Captain Moylan to order a platoon to dismount before the order could get back. 250 mounted Indians drawn up in a line of battle, came out of the woods and find military style. The seventh cavalry could hardly have done it better with painted faces, heads decorated with ribbons. They sallied out with loud war.

Speaker 1:          00:31:04       Whoops. General Custer putting more confidence in the feet of his thoroughbred. Then the voice of his rifle against 250 Indians turned back to his command calling out to his brother to throw out a dismounted line. Lieutenant Custer had anticipated the order and was already dismounting as men. That's awesome. So these guys were worked together. He goes to give the order. His brother's already on it. They ran forward and took places in the grass. The Indians open to heavy fire, which was quickly answered by our men with their sharp carbines, Ena dismounted cavalry fight. Every fourth man is usually detailed to hold the horses. But being short of fighting men and the reserves being several miles back with the train general Custer ordered every six men only to hold the horses and the rest to join the skirmish line. The Indians having three times as larger force and seeing the cavalry dismounted followed their example and dismounted from their advantage of numbers. They were able to extend the skirmish line clear around from river to river so as to enclose the cavalry in a semi circle with the woods and the river at their back. They're getting flanked. Finding though that the horses were exposed to fire. General Custer ordered them to be led further into the timber.

Speaker 3:          00:32:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:26       Now some other things take place and I'm kind of fast forward a little bit through the story. The Indians having lost two men were more cautious in their advance and finding that they could not with their heavy rifles, drive the cavalry into the woods, had recourse to another favorite weapon. They fired the grass in four or five places, meaning they set the grass on fire. So you imagine you're hiding in the grass and then also in their setting the grass on fire. Fortunately, there was little or no wind and the grass was too short and too green to burn well else. This new weapon might have proved formidable indeed. The fire, however, raised a blue curtain of smoke forming a corner segment between the fighting arcs failing in their attempt to raise a great fire. The red skins used this smoke line as a mask for their rifles advancing under cover of this curtain.

Speaker 1:          00:33:21       They would pour a volley at our line and retreat. A little bit of cover move happening. Our men soon discovered the dodge and laid equal claim to the curtain. The Indians abandoning this position began to draw in their men. Now general Custer said to Captain Moylan led us mount and drive them off. The men immediately mounted in advanced as skirmishers on a trot. Finding this was not fast enough. A charge was ordered. The men eager for the order gave a loud yell and put their horses and do a full gallop. Nearly 300 number. The site of 80 cavalry men coming toward them, like mad caps was too much for the Indians. They turned like sheep and scattered in every direction. Battles, battles on the planes, small unit tactics. Very similar to the small unit tactics that are used today. Throw [inaudible] we use smoke, you smoking in Ramadi, throw smoke. We had smoke grenades. What do you use those for? Set up a little curtain so people can't see you when you're moving.

Speaker 3:          00:34:28       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:34:32       And you'll notice also there were some aggressive action. It's that aggressive action. Both, both sides. When they got aggressive, they started doing better. When you start getting, when the other, when your opponent becomes the aggressor, you start getting put on your heels. Just gonna stay aggressive. Default mode.

Speaker 1:          00:34:53       Now, uh, talking a little bit about what it was like when they were back in camp. So they weren't on the road all the time. They weren't out in the plains all the time. Sometimes they'd be back in camp. They had there, they had bams, they had, some of them had their wives there. Uh, they had good food and you know, basically good stuff going on. They had pretty relaxed time, but it was always, let's prepare. We're going back out in the field so they're back out in the field here. General Custer who has used, was writing ahead with a couple of troops, came upon smoldering campfires that showed the three Indian teepees had recently been there. He sent bloody knife ahead with several Indian, so that bloody knife, you're gonna hear his voice throughout here. Bloody knife was costers right hand man. He was, he was an Indian Scout.

Speaker 3:          00:35:40       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:35:42       Soon the Gallup back with the information that they had located the Indians Custer's surrounded the little camp and brought back four bucks with him to our camp. The head was a minor chief named one Stapp who squad was a daughter of red cloud costs or promised them food if they helped him. But they seem to be in a hurry to leave and before they could be checked, they mounted their ponies and we're off. Custer's sent troopers after them, but the only one they could catch and bring back was one stab. He was told he would be given all the bacon, sugar and coffee that two ponies could carry if he'd act as a guide. He agreed.

Speaker 1:          00:36:27       So, uh, again, I guess the reason I wanted to bring that up is it shows that those Indians working on both sides and it was Indians that went from w back and forth between sites, depending on, you know, depending on what the situation is, depending on how they got bribed. But, and also, you know, we know that there was wars between the Indians, you know, so that's why sometimes the Indians teamed up with the soldiers, the American troops and went and got after it with them. Yeah, it is that, is that because they got, when you say bribe, like they got kind of enticed with civilization? Well, no, I'm talking about as a straight up bribe right there. They're talking to one stab and they say, Hey, one step, will you help guide us? Well, I don't know if I feel comfortable at that. Okay, we'll give you all the bacon, all the sugar, and all the coffee that you can carry on two horses.

Speaker 1:          00:37:12       He says, all right, cool, Huh? Yeah. And if they're warring, you know that if that's kind of their enemy and Elaine, right. You know? Yeah, let's do it. Yeah. Maybe he was just, maybe he was just getting, uh, getting some food out of what he would have already liked to do. Yeah. And what is it that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. There you go. There you go. Now in the black hills, they think that they find gold. They think they find gold and the black hills, and this was just a good, a good common here about, I guess you could say it's about material desires. Gold to most men means sudden wealth, big times, whiskey and gambling and women, it means fortune and adventure and all the things they never had. The gold fever is like taking dope. You're helpless when it strikes you. Careful that you know that material greed. I once read about how everyone who touched an Egyptian kings tomb was doomed to die. A violent death. Seems to me that the Indians must have put some curse like that on the white men who first touched their sacred black hills. At this time, Custer got a lot of notoriety from his black hills expedition and the discovery gold, but he never had any luck after that.

Speaker 2:          00:38:43       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:38:44       now we're getting just a cursory look at the politics of what were happening at the time. An attempt was made that summer of 75 to buy the black hills from the Indians and make legal this on slot, but the Indians were no mood to believe anything the commissioners told them and it was impossible to make a deal of any kind of feeling of utter despair and despondency cast its spell over. Even the friendly reservation Indians, maybe the radical thing sitting bull and crazy horse and Gaul and two moons in the other wild chiefs far back in the buffalo lands around the powder and the big horn we're preaching. Maybe they made sense. The free Indian was doomed. They were all to be made reservation Indians. That meant all the colorful old life would be gone forever. The buffalo hunts, the feasts, the sun dances, the visiting, and the pleasant horse stealing wars.

Speaker 1:          00:39:46       All of the old life would be no more. Maybe those radical chiefs were right. Maybe they'd all be better to make one big battle against the whites. It would be better to die a free Indian then live as a degraded helpless treaty. Indian. So evident was the hostile feeling that in the fall of 1875 that an order was submitted by the Commissioner of Indian affairs, Edward P. Smith to the secretary of the interior xe Chandler, who interned submitted to the secretary of war general Belknap. Subsequent communication from the secretary of Interior to the secretary of war dated December 1st, 1875 read as follows. I have the honor to inform you that I have this day directed the commissioner of Indian affairs to notify said Indian sitting bull and the others outside their reservations that they must return to the reservations before January 31st, 1876 and if they neglect or refuse so to move, they will be reported to the war department as hostile Indians and that a military force will be sent to compel them to obey the order of the Indian department.

Speaker 2:          00:41:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:07       There it is to compel them. Yup. There it is and how you know that's that's that you have to be wary of your government having so much power. Yeah. And leaving yourself defenseless in these situations. I think we learned a lot from the Indians, from the native Americans on that. Back to the book general Custer was not at four Abraham Lincoln when we arrived there in late April, 1876 of course that arouse a lot of talk and suspicion. When you juggled all those rumors down, you got about this. We were soon to start a big expedition up to Yellowstone to round up the hostiles and drive them back to the reservations if they would not go peacefully, we were to make good Indians out of them. There was a lot of suspicious talk going around all over the place. Custer was still in the east, so Custer had gone back to the east and you could hear a hundred tales of how he was being kept away from the expedition because he had got under the skin of president grant.

Speaker 1:          00:42:26       A lot of, a lot of the troopers didn't much care for Custer, but it looked as if major reno would command the regimen if custard didn't arrive and most of us didn't know or care a great deal about Reno. Of course, we knew that he had been a kernel of a Pennsylvania Cavalry Regiment at the end of the civil war, but he had never fought Indians and he didn't seem to be very popular with either the men or the officers. If I remember correctly, he was a west pointer and was three or four years ahead of Custer who was pretty clear that there wasn't much love lost between the two men, politics, total politics, and some of those people in the civilian world, they don't realize this stuff happens all the time. It was politics, crazy politics in the military, and then just this kind of stuff right here.

Speaker 1:          00:43:13       Oh your senior to me. Oh you, you made the other guy mad and now we're going to get pulled over to pull you off this operation. I'm going to let this guy go on the operation. This is just so typical of the military, unfortunately. And you know what, it's not just simple. The military, it's typical in any company, any business, any team. There's always going to be these political things that are happening. I mean, occasionally you get to a great organization that really limits that. I shouldn't say it's everywhere, but it's very, very common. And you know, someone just asked me on Twitter, you know, hey, it's really political. I'm not really good at at politics, you know, which is it something that I should actually try and engage in and yes, yes. It's going to, you have to, if you're in an organization that's a political organization and you want to make things happen, you want to implement changes. Yes. Start figuring out how to play those games. Oh, you don't. You're not a political person. Cool. Become one because of what you want to do is you want to do a good job. You want to, you want to do good job and whatever it is that you're doing, and sometimes that requires that you play those games. So play the Games, get good at them.

Speaker 1:          00:44:21       Back to the book, everything was uncertain in those late April and early May days, while the regiment was being whipped into marching shape. We had a few recruits, a bunch, and a bunch of fresh young horses, so there was plenty to do to break in both of them. One thing that people get wrong about the recruits was that about half of the hundred and 50 new men we had were men who either had civil war experience or had already served a five year hitch in the army. Most of the rest were plenty green, a good many of them were German boys. They made fine soldiers. Once they were trained, I think it was about May 10th that general costs are suddenly showed up. General Terry's with him. Terry was of slight build and war whiskers. He was a gentle kindly man who never struggled her ward, nothing at all. Like the quick moving dashing young Custer Terry was a brigadier general of the regular army and so he ranked Custer by two grades.

Speaker 1:          00:45:18       Word ran around camp. The General Terry was to command the whole expedition, but the Koster was to have his old regimen. Costa was as happy as a boy with a new red sled. He put a lot of zip into us now coster this political stuff that he's dealing with, um, it's still going on. It's still happening and I'm not going to go through the details of it, but he who somehow seen as a, as an agitator or an enemy of president grant, and so we actually gets ordered off the two. He goes back out, takes back over the regiment, starts whipping people into shape. He's going to work for General Terry Grant. President grant says, no, actually come back. You're not, you don't get to do this. And Koester decides he writes a dispatch to be sent directly to the president of United States. It's kind of crazy. We didn't do much communications with the president from my task lists. Here we go back to the book and the, Oh wait, here's, so here's what he actually sent. Is that awesome? That's what's beautiful about history. This is what are actually sent and grant grant president grant was a guy that was, you know, went to west point as well. He fought in the Mexican American war. He retired after that, retired from the army, but then the civil war started, so he went back in the army as a general and he fought at Shiloh and Vicksburg and actually general surrendered, surrendered to

Speaker 1:          00:47:03       President Grant. So this guys, you know, a warrior and here's what you're going to hear. Custer kind of appeal to that. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:47:11       Here we go. I have seen your order transmitted through the general of the army directing that I not be permitted to accompany the expedition about to move against the hostile Indians as my entire regiment forms a part of the proposed expedition and as I am the senior officer of the regimen on duty in the department, I respectfully but most earnestly request that I, while not allowed to go and command of the expedition, I may be permitted to serve with my regimen in the field. I appeal to you as a soldier to spare me the humiliation of seeing my regimen marched to meet the enemy and I not to share. It's dangerous.

Speaker 1:          00:47:56       It was too much for the Herro. The hero of App Apple Modix Custer was to have back his beloved regimen. So grant gives in and says, okay, you can go, you're not going to be in charge, but you can go. And so they roll out on this expedition and here's the description of what that felt like. You felt like you were somebody when you were on a good horse with a car, been dangling from its small leather ring socket on your saddle and a Colt Army revolver strapped on your hip and a hundred rounds of ammunition and your web belt and your saddle pockets. You were a cavalry men of the seventh regiment. You are part of a proud outfit that had a fighting reputation and you were ready for a fight or a frolic. So these guys had some pretty good morale rolling out. They did some hard training when they were in camp and now they're ready to get after. It talks a little bit about Costa. He describes Costa, I can almost see him myself in my mind's eye. He was wearing a broad western hat with a low crown and a wide brand brim. It was grayish and color. He'd had his long yellow hair cut just before we left.

Speaker 1:          00:49:18       And he had on a buckskin suit with fringe. He had two short bill barreled, bulldog revolvers and a Remington sporting rifle carried in a scabbard. It's my recollection that he carried a hunting knife in a fringed buck skin case. So, uh, that's, I mean, you know, straight up rock and roll stars of the 70s war fringe on their outfits. Right. So Costa was a, he's a, he's a character, right? He's definitely a character. Back to the book, when the regiment was formed in Kansas in 1866, the general that went, the general went to a lot of trouble to have each troop mounted on distinct colors. I thought this was awesome. So I included it. He's talking about what color horses they had and each troop had a, had a specific colored horse, I can still call them off even at this late date. H my own troop road blood bays, B, d I n l also were mounted on bays.

Speaker 1:          00:50:21       C, G and K had Searles a had Cole blacks and Lieutenant Edge Lilly's. Each troop had graze. We used to call e the band box. Troop m troop was the only truth that had mixed colors. The whole band road, white horses. I remember the drummer had a horse that would run away every time he mounted him, except when he put his drum on it. Then that old horse would stand still as a wooden horse. It was a fine regiment right enough. And it wasn't a man in it who didn't believe it was the greatest cavalry outfit in the entire United States army.

Speaker 1:          00:51:03       That, that, that actually is when I, when I hear about these guys talking about the horses, we actually had little relationships like that with our Humvees. We'd name them. Yeah. We named our Humvees. Yeah. We named our Humvees, various names. Uh, we used to have, when we used to do a lot more water work before the war started, we would, we actually named our outboard motors and they had little by, uh, one of my, the guy that handled the outboard motors in my second platoon. He was all into it. And, uh, his nickname was Zulu, Zulu. He was all into these motors and he had, every motor had a name and he kept these detailed bog books on how many hours and when the maintenance was done, all that. And when we came back from one deployment and we were going to go do another deployment, we came back, they said, hey, you know, you guys, guess what?

Speaker 1:          00:51:56       Good News. We got all new motors and we're going to issue you. Whatever it was. We had an eight outboard motors. Yeah. Hey, well we're gonna give you all new mood or at motors, you know, common turn yours in and we'll send those off to wherever. Get repaired are going to go into the garbage can. And you know, it was lucid. He said, I want the new motors. I got my motors. I know where they've been. I know their personalities. The voters have personalities. Well, the motors at personalities and motor analogies. Yeah, they had personalities. Yeah. Motor nowadays. And he wanted to make sure he had a relationship with those motors. And you want to give them up. Going back to the book, they're, they're starting to be out on patrol. And they're marching up what's called the Rosebud h and the five remaining troops headed down the powder and eventually arrived at the southern bank of the Yellowstone. The wagons had a tough time and it wasn't until Costa had taken a troop and scouting out a good road that the heavy wagons could make it. Custer was mighty good at this kind of work. He had a nose for scouting and finding the best trails.

Speaker 1:          00:53:07       It was June. It was. It was noon on June 22nd when we broke camp and started our march up. The Rosebud.

Speaker 3:          00:53:16       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:53:16       This just before we packed our mules, Benton ordered us to take an extra supply of salt. That meant we might be living on mule or a horse meat before we got back. I suppose we all knew by this time that we'd be hitting it into dangerous country, but as I look back, I don't believe many troopers were very worried. We knew there'd be some hard fighting, but a soldier always feels that it's the other fellow who's going to get it. Never himself that morning word spread about the camp that mail was going to be sent back home and that this would likely be the last chance to get off letters. Of course, I didn't have anybody to write too, but the officers in many of the men hurriedly scribbled letters to their dear ones and as I go to mail off these letters, they are on a boat. The troops are on a boat and they barely gone 50 feet with these letters to get a mailed off. When the boat was overturned and all three men disappeared along with the mail sack.

Speaker 1:          00:54:23       Now here's the orders that they'd go get as they're going up. These are actually the orders to Custer and again, what's awesome is these are documented. This isn't the hearsay. These are documented orders. Colonel, the brigadier general commanding directs that as soon as your regiment can be made ready for the march, you proceed up the Rosebud in pursuit of the Indians who's trailed was discovered by major reno a few days since it is of course impossible to give you any definite instructions in regard to this movement. And we're not impossible to do. So. The department commander places too much confidence in your zeal energy and ability to wish to impose on you precise orders pretty. So he's giving them, hey look, here's my general idea is give them some commanders in tent, but he doesn't want to give them anything too specific because he knows he can't.

Speaker 1:          00:55:16       He hasn't always going to be in two days what's going to be happening up there. He will, however, indicate to you his own views of what action should be and desires that you should conform to them unless you should see sufficient reason for departing from them. So he gives him his orders, but he gives them some pretty good leeway to work through. And that's why there's some, there's some discussion on whether or not custard disobeyed and there's a, it's a, it's a long discussion probably with no one could ever come with a solid conclusion on because there was some, there was definitely some, some leeway in the orders and those that was the leeway that I just read. Then the orders continue to go on, but I'm not going to go into those minor details of them. Back to the book. We hit the trail at five o'clock sharp that second morning. These guys are up pretty early. Probably had to get up like, I dunno, four 30 to get before the to get to get on the road before five o'clock around noon we began past signs of big Indian. As I remember we made around 33 miles that day.

Speaker 2:          00:56:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:28       The next day we rode hard to, there was no foolishness. Custer had a bunch of re and crow scout's ahead with him and he kept them covering the ground far off both flanks of the column. We were in Indian country now. Right enough. So that's, that's very common. We'd still do that today. You have a main element moving in a in a formation and out on the flanks or maybe some high ground. You have other smaller elements that can protect your flanks and see if there's any problems up ahead. In one place, we halted, there had been a sun dance lodge.

Speaker 2:          00:57:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:06       The scalp of a white man was still hanging from the ridge pole getting into Indian country. It was around eight o'clock when we got orders to saddle up, we marched about 10 miles when we were halted in a sort of ravine. We've been told to make as little noise as possible in light. No fires. There'd been no bugle calls for a day or two. The Sun was at our back, so apparently we were headed straight west. Now toward the little big horn, I later learned that the Indians called it greasy grass. I never did know why.

Speaker 2:          00:57:40       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:57:41       About the time. General Custer came back from his scout word run around that the Indians had found a box of hardtack that had dropped from one of Captain Yates is mules, two or three troopers who had been sent back to pick up the box, had reported seeing two hostels trying to open it with their Tomahawks. This meant that the Indians held us, had us under observation.

Speaker 2:          00:58:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:04       Apparently custard figured on hiding the command in the ravine during the day and then attacking the big Indian village on the little big horn at daybreak the next morning. So there, there, there,

Speaker 2:          00:58:20       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:58:20       They know that the Indians know that they're there. This is why I included that. Then you're going to hear that kind of over and over again. Custer's thinking they're going to surprise him and everyone's telling him we're not going to surprise them. They know we're here. It was Sunday morning, June 25th we were still more than 12 miles from the little horn and the Indian village, but the Indians knew where we were and all about us.

Speaker 2:          00:58:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:48       I approached,

Speaker 1:          00:58:51       I approached as near that now. So there he, he's a conversation going on and it's actually coster and Ben teen and they're having a conversation with a couple of people including some of the scouts and he kind of goes over and does a little ease dropping as I approached, as near as seemed respectful. And while I was waiting to catch Ben Teens attention, I couldn't help but overhear part of the conversation. Charlie Reynolds, the famous white scout who is never to see the sunset that day was talking. And I heard him say that there was the biggest bunch of Indians he'd ever seen over there. Finally I heard. But venting state Acosta hadn't. We better keep the regiment together general if this is a big camp, as they say, we'll need every man we have. Custer's only answer was you have your orders. So you can see again, [inaudible] ease, not listening to people, Scouts, reconnaissance units and his other officers that are with him. And this is sort of the classic, you know, Hey, I've got a, I've got an I disagree with your plan. Shut up and do it anyways. You have your orders. That's a classic example of that.

Speaker 3:          01:00:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:07       We were tired and dirty and hungry or horses hadn't had a good drink of water since the day before and we weren't much better off. We knew right enough that this was the day, this was it. This was what we'd been training and working for all these years. Captain Benton used to say, the government pays you to get shot at and I suppose the dumbest, greenest trooper and the regimen figured that this day he'd get shot at plenty. Here was the seventh cavalry with a total of some 600 men split up into four outfits. Apparently the Indian scouts

Speaker 1:          01:00:55       and experienced old guys guides knew that there were several thousand of the hostels, but it was, it is my belief that cost her and most of our officers thought they'd have to whip somewhere between 1,015 hundred and they expected most of these to be poorly armed and poorly led from experience. They figured the Indians would fight only a rear guard action while the women, children, old men and pony herds got away. But in place of a maximum of 1500 Indian warriors, it developed it. There were possibly twice that number about to face costers total of 600 so that's the report that they're getting. And

Speaker 1:          01:01:43       there's a little bit of controversy about what, how many Indians were there, but it was a lot. And here, here we go. This, I'm going to jump forward to another section and talking about Custer and did cost her. The name of the chapter is did Koster and it's sort of a appendix, so it's not part of the story, it's after the story, but it talks about, did Costa refuse advice from his scouts? How many Indian warriors were camped on the West Bank of the little big horn that Sunday morning of June 25th against the real figure, how many customers think he would have to fight? Did customer refuse to believe the estimated number of warriors? Has Scouts told him he would have to fight? Did he fail to follow the advice of his experienced guides? And interpreters. One of the best accounts of what the guides thought about the number of Indians and the chances of Custer closing with them is contained in the excellent book. William Jackson Indian scout by James William Schulz, Willard shots. It is worth careful reading and here's a couple of excerpts from that. On the third day we struck the trail of the hostels, the one that Reno had found several days before said bloody knife. Now remember bloody knife is is customers, you know main scout there, they're tight said bloody knife. My friends, the big this big tree trail proves what we heard.

Speaker 2:          01:03:12       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:03:13       that the Ogallala, the Miniconjou, the sand Sark and the Teton sue have left their agencies to join sitting bull and crazy horse horse. I'm sure that even this trail does not account for all that have left their agencies. There surely are other trails and trails to of the Cheyennes and the Arapahos

Speaker 1:          01:03:40       bloody knife continued. It is as I have told long hair, this gathering of enemy tribes is too many for us, but he will not believe me. He is bound to lead us against them. They are not far away just over this ridge. They are all in Campton waiting for us crazy horse and sitting bull are not men without, since they have their scouts too and some of them surely have their eyes upon us. Well tomorrow we are going to have a big fight, a losing fight myself. I know what is to happen to me. My sacred helper has given me warning that I am not to see the set of tomorrow's son.

Speaker 2:          01:04:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:24       Sad words. Those they chilled us. I saw Charlie Reynolds nod in agreement to them and was chilled again when he said in a low voice. I feel as he does tomorrow will be the end for me too.

Speaker 2:          01:04:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:38       Anyone who wants my little outfit of stuff pointing to his war pack can have it now. Lieutenant Varnum who is in charge of the scouts came over and said that it was general Koster's plan to attempt a surprise attack on the camp of the enemy.

Speaker 2:          01:04:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:55       Said bloody knife. We cannot surprise the enemy. They are not crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:05:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:05:01       Without DME, without doubt, their scouts have watched every move we have made.

Speaker 2:          01:05:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:13       Convinced at last that we could not possibly surprise the enemy. General Custer ordered a quick advance with the scouts and himself in the lead.

Speaker 3:          01:05:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:23       We had not gone far when bloody knife and his to RISD joined us and reported that on the other side of the ridge they had found the day old trail of many more enemy going toward the valley of little big horn. They were excited and said to cost or general. We have discovered the camp down there on the little big horn. It is a big one too big for you to tackle. Why? There are thousands and thousands of Sioux and Cheyenne is down there for a moment. That general stared at him angrily I thought and then said sternly I shall attack them. Classic Ego Maniac right here. Sorry, but that's what this is.

Speaker 3:          01:06:02       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:06:07       Coster gave orders for attack upon the camp. None of the scouts had been foreign. The lead and they all came in. Reason Crows and whites and Robert and I, we were a gathering of solemn faces speaking in English and the sign language too so that all would understand. Brewer described them, the enemy camp, it was, he said all of three miles long and made up of hundreds of lodges, hundreds and hundreds of lodges above it and below it and west of it. There were thousands and thousands of horses that were being close, hurted with his few riders. Long hair decided to attack the camp and we were going to have a terrible fight. We should all take courage, fight hard, make our every shot a killer. He finished and none spoke. But after a minute or two, bloody knife looked up and signed to the sun. I shall not see you go down behind the mountains tonight. And at that I almost choked. I felt he knew his end was near and there was no escaping it. I turned and looked the other way. I thought that my own end was near. I felt very sad. So there's the full account of these. All the scouts, some are, you know, some are white, some are Indian, native Americans, different tribes, and they're all telling them the same thing. This is not a good plan.

Speaker 3:          01:07:35       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:07:36       So back to the book, apparently cost her head planned to stay in hiding in the ravine. We had reached a little after 10 o'clock that Sunday and then attack the village at daybreak the next morning of the 26 that would more or less of dovetailed into Terry's idea of boxing the Indians. But when he found the hostile scouts had discovered his column, he figured there was nothing to do but attack at once.

Speaker 1:          01:08:08       Now we get a little, um, a little report here from a guy named Sergeant Daniel [inaudible] who had barely turned 23 at the time of the battle in canapes own account of the fight published in the magazine of the Historical Society of Montana. He said, when we got to the top of the bluffs, the Indians had disappeared, but we were in plain view of the Indian camps, which appeared to cover a space of about two miles wide and four miles long on the west side of the river. We were then charging it full speed. This camp is two miles wide. That's a mat. Two miles, two by four, two by four miles, and you've got 600 guys. I actually didn't even cost it doesn't have 600 guys to get 200 guys.

Speaker 3:          01:09:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:09:01       Reno and his troops were again seen to our left moving at full speed down the valley at the site of the Indian camps. The boys of our five troops began to cheer overconfidence. Hmm. Some of the horses became so excited that the writers were unable to hold them in ranks. And the last word I heard general Custer say we're hold your horses in boys. There are plenty of them down there for all of us. Again, now we have total overconfidence in the situation. We think we're going to win. This is going to be fun. Oh, there's two by four mile big camp. No big deal. I got 500 guys with me. So this is where the force is split up and Costa goes off to attack any good. It seems like he goes about a mile away, mile and a half away. And again, I'm going to make the same statement that I said when I talked about the battle with w w when we did the wooden leg podcast. I'm not trying to re historically reconstruct a battle right now. There's plenty of books that do that, so I'm just kind of assembling the broad design of what's happening.

Speaker 3:          01:10:07       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:10:08       So now the forest is split up a reno and venting or kind of have troops and holding, but they're starting to get in a little firefight themselves. We saw a second figure in uniform riding towards us. He was Trump, a tier Martini of my company who had been assigned that morning as a special orderly Trump a to general Custer. I learned afterwards that he had a message from or to Ben teen that had been scribbled out on a field order pad and signed by Lieutenant Cook, the adjutant it read Ben Teen. Come on, big village, be quick. Bring packs. Ps bring pack.

Speaker 3:          01:10:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:10:48       That's the note that they get from Custer. Sounds like customer might might've. Uh, once he split off, things started going sideways real quick.

Speaker 3:          01:11:01       They

Speaker 1:          01:11:02       again, Ben Teen and and Reno have their troops start now getting engaged in a firefight. Back to the book we could hear heavy firing now. Before long we passed several cro or re scouts driving a few heads of Indian ponies and they shouted soldiers and pointed toward the bluffs that were rising towards the north. We knew that we were close to the valley of little big horn and that somewhere in this neighborhood there was hard fighting going on. Benton ordered us to draw pistols and we charged up the bluffs that a gallop expecting at any moment to run into hostels. When we reached the brow of the first set of rolling hills, the river valley suddenly opened up below us to our left. It was a sight to strike terror in the hearts of the bravest men down there in the valley, maybe 150 feet or more below us and somewhere around a half a mile away there were figure scalloping on horseback and much shooting farther down the river. There were great masses of mounted men. We suspicioned we're Indians. We were going at it at a fast clip ourselves, and we had no more than caught the swift glimpse of this tragic battlefield below. When we saw mounted and dismounted soldiers on a knoll of a hill onto the north ward, we swiftly road towards them.

Speaker 1:          01:12:19       So these guys are seeing this massive battle take place. They're kind of on the high ground.

Speaker 1:          01:12:26       He talks about here what kind of weapon tree the the Indians had for my part. I believe that fully half of the warriors carried only bows and arrows and lances and that possibly half of the remainder carried odds and end of old muzzle loaders and single shot rifles of various vintages. Probably not more than 25 or 30% of the warriors carried modern repeating rifles. That sounds pretty close to what would leg said. They said they mostly had bows and arrows. Nate, some guys had rifles, but it was mostly bows and arrows and one other port Indian boys from 14 years old up accompanied the warriors and took part, especially in the later stages of the fighting the soldiers. Incidentally, we're armed with single shot 45 70 caliber Springfield carbines and accurate and deadly wrapping up to 600 yards, but when fired rapidly, the breach became foul and the greasy cartridges often jammed. It could not be removed by the extractor. This meant that the empty shell had to be forced out by the blade of a hunting knife. This very fact was responsible for the death of many a trooper this hot Sunday and may actually have been the indirect cause of the great disaster

Speaker 1:          01:13:41       weapons, getting dirty weapons, getting hot and dirty, got to take care of your weapon. It sounds like this was a beyond them just taking care of their weapon. Right. Sounds like it was a design issue as well. Yeah. Renew had crossed the river and had his troops in line of columns of four with the Indian, with the Indian scouts on his left. Soon Indian horsemen were seen writing madly to and fro in the valley and shortly the southern end of the Indian camps came into Reno. Now had his three troops and scouts thrown out in a skirmish line covering possibly the full width of the narrow valley.

Speaker 1:          01:14:19       So there they see the enemy. Now they get online. That's a very common thing. If you can picture this, you've got your guys in a column. How many, if we are, if you're in a column of three, three columns and you see the enemy ahead of you, how many people do think can shoot the three, the three, the three in the front. So that's why you keep hearing this, this idea of a skirmish line and it's the same tactic that we use now. Oh, we got enemy in front of us. Cool. We're going to get online. They call it a skirmish line here. We would call it a get online. Like they'll, they're spread out red on one. Yup. So now they get, they got 50 guys cold. I have 50 guns online instead of three. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:14:58       Realizing that this charge toward the Indian hordes would end in almost certain disaster. Reno now ordered his troops to dismount and fight on foot. Even before this order came, scores of Indians had swung to the south westward and pressed against the cro and re scouts. These were forced to give way. Things were looking bad for Reno and he ordered a skirmish lines to fall back to the edge of a heavy grove of cottonwoods that followed a bend in the river and jutted out halfway across the valley, the horses were led into the woods while a thin line of men held three sides of the Grove, some 90 men were holding not less than 250 yards of line, hundreds of mounted Indians. We're now half circling the skirmish line, riding in close, firing from under their ponies next and then galloping away. Reno's men were now either firing from a prone position or using the bank of a dry creek bed as a barricade and rifle rest. So Reno's guys are now getting basically surrounded in taking up this new position. Sergeant O'hara of troop m had been killed. The first man on the skirmish line to die. Apparently Reno had a fairly defendable position and some people think if he had pulled in his lines and consolidated his position, he might've held out here for an indefinite length of time, or at least as long as his ammunition lasted. But the savage yells, the heavy firing, the smoke and dust all and fear all combined to fog his judgment.

Speaker 1:          01:16:27       Suddenly Custer's favorite scout bloody knife was shot through the head and his brain scattered all over Reno.

Speaker 1:          01:16:34       Then the Scout Dorman fell and Charlie Reynolds was shot through the head Reno figuring that his only chance lay in getting to high ground across the river, shouted for his men to mount up and company formation to troop commanders heard the order and amid the confusion and excitement had their men mount up and line and column of force. The third troop g under lieutenant Macintosh himself, part Indian, who had been adopted by General Mcintosh, was in the woods and did not get the order until the two other troops with Reno riding at their head. We're racing upstream trying to find a place to cross the river. All order and discipline were gone. So they're surrounded, things fall apart. He's basically saying, we got to retreat, we gotta get Outta here. And the assessment was that maybe they were in a defendable position. They could have held there, but who knows? Who knows whether that's true or not.

Speaker 1:          01:17:32       Nobody will ever know how any man escaped alive from this mad retreat. All we are sure of is that the charging troop broke through the cordon of mounted Indians and followed a buffalo Prath to the river here. They somehow manage to jump their horses over a four or five foot bank, plunge across the stream and scramble up a narrow trail to the steep hills, to the east, hundreds of Indians fired indiscriminately into the panic stricken soldiers. And the wonder is that any trooper escaped, no motion picture could be as fantastic as this wild milling of frightened men and horses.

Speaker 3:          01:18:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:18:15       Again, just to remind you that this is what's happening with Reno and his group. They don't know where Costa is right now with his crew of 200 guys back to the book in all 26 troopers in scouts and three officers were killed either in this ride through the Indian gauntlet or back at the edge of the woods of the 19 men left behind 17 cross the river and reached Reno Hill on foot within two hours. Lieutenant Wdo and private O'Neil did not join us until 36 hours later. They came right through where I was on guard. It was now somewhere around three 30 in the afternoon. Reno Shaken and unnerved had reached the hilltop and hear his frightened troopers. We're joining him. He was whipped and completely disorganized.

Speaker 1:          01:19:10       This is a rally point and if you have a predesignated rally point and you say, hey guys, look, you see this big hill over here. If everything goes to hell, can we get all jumbled up? Go to that point. It doesn't sound like he actually pre-brief that cause that would have been a, you could've just said, hey, back to the rally point. You could have given a very clear order if you're trying to not really know where you're going and you're saying retreat while you don't do it in a very organized fashion. So preplan some contingencies.

Speaker 3:          01:19:41       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:19:45       Now they get in this position and Reno, like I said, is in rough shape. Back to the book. Cool, capable Ben teen, more or less assumed command major Rooney Reno had just come through a terrible experience and at the moment was glad to have Ben teen, his junior takeover, quickly venting, dismounted his own three troops and ordered us to form a skirmish line. Reno's men had expended most of their ammunition. So we were told to divide ours with them. We had Ben Teens, hundred and 20 men intact, and there were around 60 men who'd been fighting in the valley with Reno. And even before we got the kinks out of our legs from our long horse hours in the saddle, we were asking each other, where's Custer, what had become of Custer and his five troops? Apparently Custer was now much farther on to the north ward and in this moment was hotly engaged, but no one was certain. All we knew was that he had disappeared with almost half the regiment. We could hear the sound of distant firing echoing through the hills and valleys from that direction. Customer must be down there.

Speaker 1:          01:21:01       So this is happening there in the skirmish position and they're starting to try and get reorganized back to the book. The wounded men who could mount were put on horses, but the others were carried in blankets by details of six troopers on foot. It takes a lot of people to carry it down, man down man. It takes a lot of people to carry it down, man, and in this case it takes six people to carry one down. Man. Nowadays we weigh a lot more. We got, we got all of our guns, we got body armor. It's hard. Guys are heavy. Pretty soon it looked as if the Indian masters were coming towards us. It didn't take long to realize that this was true here. We were stretched out all over hell's half Acre a troop. On this hill mob, another in this little valley and a third and over there, a third troop behind at a slow walk came packed trains the wounded men and the rear guard reno inventing both sense danger and order to withdrawal.

Speaker 1:          01:22:06       The advanced troops were dismounting and fought as skirmishers in the center. In a slight depression, the horses and mules were staked and an inadequate little field hospital was established, but it was impossible to shield the men and stock from the Indians firing from a hilltop off to the east. Indians got some high ground on him. Can't stop them. What do you do? They got to high ground you. You can't hide animal. After animals killed and the men were hit, it was tough not to be able to do something about it. We'd hardly got settled on our own skirmish line with age men posted at 20 foot intervals when the Indians and all but completely surrounded us and the fighting begin in earnest. There was no full fledged charge, but little groups of Indians would creep up as close as they could get. And for behind bushes or little nose open fire, they'd practiced all kinds of cute tricks to draw our fire. Maybe a naked redskin would suddenly jumped to his feet and while you drew a bead on him, he'd throw himself to the ground.

Speaker 2:          01:23:13       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:23:14       They're under this attack for a pretty good amount of time. And then finally the sun went down that night like a ball of fire. Pretty soon the quick Montana twilight settled down on us and then came the chill of the high plains. There was no moon and no one ever welcome darkness more than we did. We felt terribly alone on that dangerous hilltop. We were million miles from nowhere and death was all around us.

Speaker 2:          01:23:45       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:23:46       All through that Short Black Knight, the orgy went on down below in the river valley. It struck fear in our hearts, just as the mystery of Custer's disappearance made our blood run cold each time we tried to solve it, where was coster? What had happened to him?

Speaker 2:          01:24:04       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:24:05       so down there, up there, they're hiding. It's dark, they're scared, they got wounded in all they hear down in the valley as the Indians going crazy. The rhythm of the Tom Tom's the wild victory dance. They can hear all this.

Speaker 2:          01:24:21       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:24:22       back to the book. They're talking about cost or they could not all be killed, not Lucky Koster and those five gallon troops who rolled with him, why did he abandoned us? And those three bloody hours before dark said, save us. We had no less than a dozen men killed and three times that number of wounded.

Speaker 2:          01:24:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:24:40       He's actually saying, man, where was Custer here we were getting crushed on the battlefield and cook cost or is not there to support us. Where do you go? Hmm. Now during the night at reigns a little bit and finally the sun starts to come up and just as the sun starts to come up, it starts getting light back to the book. Joan said something about taking off his overcoat. He started to roll on his side so he could get his arms and shoulders out without exploding, exposing himself to fire. Suddenly I heard him cry out. He'd been shot straight through the heart, minute or two later, another bullet from the hilltop, torn to the Hickory, but have my rifle splitting it squarely into, I was plenty mad because my army carbing wouldn't let me return the compliment, so he just got shot. The rifle stock actually happened. One of my guys and in Ramadi, one of my guys got is his rifle stock, got blown up by an RPG. I seem come, fallen out of a sniper position and he's got his arm. His weapon is in two pieces. I'm thinking how lucky to be alive. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:25:55       Along about this time are 30 or 40 wounded men began crying out for water. H troop held the hill on the south west. There was a draw that ran down the west side of the hill to the river. It was a rough and exposed and it looked like a dead cinch that anyone who tried to work his way down that drug, the river would be killed. Indians concealed in the bushes across the river. We're firing up at us and they had every foot of this draw and river riverbank covered.

Speaker 2:          01:26:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:26:24       But we had to do something for those men who were up wounded, crying for water. Finally bent [inaudible] called for volunteers.

Speaker 2:          01:26:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:26:32       I think there were 17 of us all together who stepped forward. He detailed four of us from h who were extra good marksmen to take up an exposed position on the brow of the hill facing the river. We were to stand up and not only draw the fire of the Indians below, but we were to pump as much lead as we could into the bushes where the Indians were hiding while the water party hurry down to the draw, got their buckets and pots and canteens filled and then made their way back.

Speaker 2:          01:27:00       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:27:01       so we got a little covering move happening. Obviously it just happened that the four of us who were posted on the hill where all German boys, Geiger Mechling void, and myself, none of us for war wounded, although we stood exposed on that Ridge for more than 20 minutes and they through plenty of lead at us. Several of the water party, however, were badly wounded. Although we kept the steady fire into the bushes where the Indians were hiding, each of us was given a congressional medal of honor.

Speaker 2:          01:27:31       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:27:32       You don't think about that. You don't think about it. You, you actually going to need water. You run out of water, you're going to get guys dehydrated and a die. So now you're gonna risk people's lives to go get water. Ben Teen had been walking up and down the line urging men to hold fast, not to waste their firing, to keep cool. I remember saying to him, colonel, you better get down sir. You'll get killed. Don't worry about me. He answered grimly I'm all right. He sure lived a charmed life that day, but things look bad. And finally Benton hurried to the north side of the lines and asked Major Reno for reinforcements. He made it clear that the Indians were about to charge his line and then if they were able to sweep over it, the whole outfit would be destroyed. Reno told him to take as much of an troupe as he could gather.

Speaker 1:          01:28:18       Those men certainly look good to us. Soon after they came up, Captain Benton led the charge, yelling and firing. We went at the double quick and the Indians broken ran when we had cleaned them out for a hundred yards ahead of us. We hustled back to our holes. Once again, we settled back to the business of getting fired at with men hit at intervals with men hit at intervals and with the poor horses and mules taking a terrible beating in their hollow. It must have been a long time. About long about this time that Ben team called me to attention and made me sergeant.

Speaker 2:          01:28:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:28:53       We had one sergeant, two men killed, and 12 wounded and age tree Palone. So once again, we see some and we also see some focus of forces, right. We see some prioritize and execute, hey, we're going to get overrun. There's our biggest problem right now is we're going to get overrun. So you know what? Hey, major reno gave me a bunch of guys and we're going to go do an aggressive assault and take care of this number one priority, so let's focus our forces on that. Here we go, and that's what they did. They got aggressive and got after it.

Speaker 3:          01:29:23       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:29:23       back to the book, the gunfire to almost ceased and some of us left our trenches and student little groups on the brow of the hill. Then something happened that I'll never forget if I live to be a hundred the heavy smoke seem to lift for a few moments and they're in the valley below. We caught glimpses of the thousands of Indians on foot and horseback with their pony hoards with their pony herds, dogs and pack animals, and all the trappings of a gay great camp solely moving southward. It was like some biblical exodus. The Israelites moving into Egypt's a mighty tribe on the march. We thought at first that it must be some trick that the Indians were only moving their families from danger and that the warriors would soon return and try to overwhelm us patiently. We weighed in in our little trenches the long June afternoon, dragged on the firing at all, but ceased the smoke in the valley had blown away and the last Indian had gone. Then Reno ordered the whole camp to move as close to the river as possible. We would get as far as ways we could from the terrible stench of death. There was plenty of water now for the wounded and towards the evening. The company cooks made us the best meal they could. At least. We had hot coffee and plenty of Bacon and so card attack.

Speaker 1:          01:30:46       It was our first meal in 36 hours. Then night came down. We were wary, but while those on guard, we're awake and alert. The rest of the command slept, but it was an uneasy sleep. We still had heard no word from Costa. We began to suspicion that some terrible fate might've ope overtaken him. What it was. We could only guess. The Sun was well in the sky that next morning of the 27th and we saw dust rising slowly from the valley northward, so then they get approached by a young officer. They'd been out scouting what was happening. A young officer flung himself off his horse.

Speaker 1:          01:31:32       He was Lieutenant Bradley Chief of Scouts. Early this morning, scouting in the hills on the east side, a little horn lieutenant Bradley had come across a battlefield dotted with the white bodies of dead men. He had counted more than 190 dead. He was certain that Custer was among them. Apparently no white man had escaped. One or two crow scouts. Notably young curly had reported at the steam or far west at the junction of little big and big horn the day before. There had been no interpreter on hand, but curly had convinced the officer's that all white soldiers who rode with custard had been killed at dawn, Lieutenant Bradley and a few men and a few men. It started out to search for the field of tragedy. Curly was right. No soldier. A white man had escaped a little later. The slight figure of bearded General Terry with his staff and a small escort arrived on the hill. There were tears running down his cheeks when he spoke. I think most of us had tears in her eyes to more than 200 of our comrades and had met a violent death and now naked on buried. We're lying in the hot Montana Cen three miles northward.

Speaker 2:          01:32:51       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:32:51       so they'd go out to recover the bodies or bury the bodies there on patrol back to the book. Suddenly we caught glimpses of white objects lying along a ridge that led northward. We pulled up our horses. This was the battlefield here. Custer's La Loche had finally run out.

Speaker 2:          01:33:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:33:14       From the way the men lay, it was clear that the first one troop had been ordered to dismount and fight as a skirmish line. Then a second troop had been posted a little further on and to the east. Then a third troop and a fourth, and finally they're on the Knob of a hill lace on 30 bodies in a small circle. We knew instinctively we would find Custer. There. We wrote forward at a walk. Most of the troopers had been stripped of clothing and scalped. Some of them had been horribly mutilated. Custer was lying, a trifle to the southeast of the top of the knoll

Speaker 1:          01:33:53       where the monument is today. I stood six feet away holding captain bent teens horse while he identified the general, his body had not been touched, say for a single bullet hole in the left temple near the ear and a hole on his left breast. He looked almost as if it had been piece of we sleeping. His brother Tom lay a few feet away. He was terribly mutilated, scattered over the field where the swollen bodies of the dead horses, but there were not many of them. It seemed clear that the Indians sweeping up from the draws and Cooley's on all sides had stampeded the mounts while the men were fighting dismounted from every direction. Hordes of crazed Indians must have attacked with the wild courage that their desperation and hate gave them.

Speaker 2:          01:34:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:34:42       Nothing could check their mad charges. Captain Dentine found a bit of wood, hollowed out a whole, found an empty shell, wrote customer's name on a bit of paper and placed it in the shell and shoved the deep in hole in a piece of wood. Then he pushed this into the ground at customer's head. He would make sure that the burial party would identify Custer's body. The following morning we went back to Custer hill and buried as well as we could the naked mutilated bodies of our comrades. It was a gruesome task.

Speaker 2:          01:35:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:35:22       Custer may have made a mistake to divide his command that Sunday afternoon of June 25th but the gods themselves were against him. It was the Indians. Day eight I'm going to go back to finish this up to the section of the book that we started at and that is this account from major reno who we know a little bit more about now,

Speaker 2:          01:35:55       but

Speaker 1:          01:35:59       I think that the way he wraps it up and they actually did a massive trial, a big trial for Reno, and they found that the actions that he took were not negligent. He might've made some calls that might not have been the best tactical to calls if you look back on it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:36:17       But he,

Speaker 1:          01:36:20       he was basically cleared of any wrong doing clearly. Clearly I think it's pretty clear that wind off thinks, you know, he broke and he lost control of his troops and then Ben teen kind of took over and got things squared away. Okay. Clearly, clearly wind off was also a huge fan of venting, so he might be spinning that story a little bit in that direction. But I do think that Reno, I think that him looking back on the incident and he kind of wraps up his assessment of what happened and what went wrong that day. And also I think for lack of a better word, that there is a, if there's a warning of sorts in this, so here's Reno. After much reflection, I've concluded that several great blunders where the direct causes of the [inaudible] massacre, it is an established fact that Custer disobeyed the orders of the general in command of the expedition for instead of waiting to meet General Gibbon and General Terry on June 26 at the Rosebud, and then cooperate with them and their concerted plan of action as he had been directed. As soon as he struck the trail of the Indians, he followed it until he came upon the Indian village, June 25th

Speaker 1:          01:37:42       then without attempting to communicate with either Terry or given and without taking the trouble to ascertain the strength or positions of the Indians, he divided his regiment into three separate battalions, an act which nothing can justify and dashed against the Indians thus recklessly driving his own and my commands into an Ambi SCADE of 5,000 sue, nor did cost or take into consideration the unfed and exhausted conditions of the men and his horses, and he entirely ignored the fact that the Indians were key Vva and ready for the attack at noon. Whereas it would have been an easy matter to surprise them very early in the morning. The only explanation for such conduct on the part of so brilliant and officer as cost are undoubtedly was otherwise, was his great personal ambition. He had fought himself partially disgraced because he had been superseded in command of the expedition by General Terry, and it was well known that he was resolved, if possible, to carry off all the honors of the campaign for being in command of the only cavalry regiment attached to the expedition. He knew the brunt of the fighting would necessarily fall on him, and he made it no secret of his intention to cut loose from Terry where there was fighting to be due to be done and to carry on the campaign on his own hook

Speaker 1:          01:39:22       absolutely insensible. The fear. He was so reckless and daring in the extreme and driven by an intense desire to distinguish himself by some brilliant exploit. He made his head long dash two a horrible death without the most causal regard for the maxims of military prudence. Even now after the lapse of nearly 10 years, the horror of Custer's battlefield is still vividly before me and the harling sight of those mutilated and decomposing bodies crowning the heights on which poor coster fell will linger in my memory till death. And I think that's a pretty clear warning. And of course there are military lessons to be learned from this account of the battle of little big horn. Maintain the element of surprise. Keep your forces unified as much as possible, taken, maintain the high ground to rule. We should always follow trust your reconnaissance units. You've got them out there, listen to them, make sure your troops are rested and fed and have water. But beyond those fundamental military tactical lessons, I think it becomes quite clear that there is a another enemy that we must always be on the watch for.

Speaker 2:          01:41:20       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:41:22       then that is ego, our own ego. We have to keep our ego in check. You have to watch out for it and guard against it. Getting control of view and interfering with your decision making process. No, I always say this. This doesn't mean that ego should be banished. It absolutely has a very positive side as well. It drives us to push hard. It drives us to do our best. And a guy like Custer who personally led cavalry charges at the battle of Gettysburg that were critical in stopping flanking actions from confederate troops and an action that no doubt was fueled by courage and bravery, but also was fueled at some level by ego because ego is a driver of our actions and some times it can be a positive driver of our actions, but it has to be balanced, has to be balanced by humility in open ears and an open mind. Keep the ego in check, Anna, I'll tell you something else like your ego on another lesson from this is that you have to keep your emotions in check. And you heard the brutality that was committed in these wars on both sides, both sides, anger and fear and frustration. Those result in an escalation on both sides.

Speaker 2:          01:43:22       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:43:23       And on both sides there were truly horrific acts of savagery. And that's an extreme example. This whole story is an extreme example of both those, both the ego and the emotional. May Him.

Speaker 2:          01:43:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:43:46       That are shown in this example are very extreme, but also think about how they relate toward your every day life,

Speaker 2:          01:43:55       okay?

Speaker 1:          01:43:56       How often do you let your ego get in the way of making the right decision? How often do you let your emotions drive your decisions? How often do you go to war because of your emotions and because of your ego? How often did you go to a war because of them? In what I'm saying? Stop. Stop doing that. Get control of your emotions and get control of your ego and put them in check so you aren't escalating to situations where you savage your enemy or your friends or your coworkers or your peers or your family or whoever. You do nothing in those situations to further your mission in life. But instead you just distract and detract from reaching your real goals. Don't let that happen. Learn burn from this particular battle. See what the emotions and ego do.

Speaker 2:          01:45:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:45:15       And find a better way. Deescalate the build coalitions with people instead of building blood feuds. Work with people instead of working against people. Lift people up instead of casting them down. And in short, what that is, is leading. That is what true leadership is and that is what a true leader does.

Speaker 2:          01:45:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:45:57       So go out there

Speaker 2:          01:46:03       and do it.

Speaker 1:          01:46:09       And I think that's all I've got for tonight. Just a, just a brutal, brutal situation that this is, I actually pull up some other quotes too. In the beginning of the book, I talk about some of these massacres that were considered, uh, committed by the soldiers. Yeah. In some of these raids. And this is one right here, John S. Smith from his congressional testimony. This is from the sand creek massacre, by the way. I saw the bodies of those lying there cut all the,

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       Worst mutilated than any I ever saw before. The women cut to pieces with knives scalped their brains knocked out children two or three months old.

Speaker 2:          01:47:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:47:00       All ages lying there from sucking infants up to warriors by whom? Where they mutilated by United States troops.

Speaker 2:          01:47:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:47:18       In the, again, this might, my point in bringing that up is that it's the escalation of emotions and the escalation of ego. And I'm going to pay them back. And we so often drive ourselves to these situations in everyday life. I mean obviously not to this scale.

Speaker 2:          01:47:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:47:38       But how do we overcome that? And I think you got to concentrate on keeping your ego and your emotions in check. Yeah. Yeah. And there's also that slippery slope factor where

Speaker 1:          01:47:53       like remember the the one I think it was, I think it was me lie, where we're talking about the slippery slope in kind of one thing leads to another where if you kind of look at the end, the result, you're like, no way. I would never do that. I will never be in that situation. But it starts like with one little thing, you know? So from one step to the, to the next step or the for one little step where you slide or on the slippery slope, it's like, that's easy. You know, where it's like, all right, one guy gets mad, he slaps this guy, you know? Or even, I mean it goes really with anything with a slippery slope. Anything like cheating on your diet, I don't know. It does. And what we're really talk about is what's the cure to the slippery slope?

Speaker 1:          01:48:37       It's the discipline plan. Yeah. It's maintaining the discipline is maintaining the personal discipline. What you're talking about, like how it's a slippery slope going down the doughnut slope. Yeah. Right. We don't want to do that. But on top of that, you get into a leadership situation. Absolutely. It's a slippery slope and you give that little bit, you think, you know it's no big deal. I liked that guy. Hey, he's got, he got a little angry. That's okay. But everybody else saw that happen and now you're just allowing this to happen and it's only going to escalate. But it's so I think about this, think about easy it is to stop that one thing and say, hey, echo, what are you doing? Come over here. Hey look, we don't hit prisoners. Stop what you're doing. Get it together. If you're mad, go over there. Take a breath. Yeah. That's pretty easy for me to stop. Now what happens when you shoot somebody? Now we have, you know, we have a major incident now you're going to jail. I mean it's, it's a totally different thing. I could've stopped that very easily in the beginning. Yeah. Or

Speaker 1:          01:49:32       I can have major issues to deal with in the end. Yeah. Like this. I mean this is more of like the slippery slope situation, but not war or nothing like that. But you know how like, I dunno financial guys, right? They'll, there'll be like, hey, going to do in Vr,

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       I don't know, investments. You know, you hear about this where there'll be like, okay, I'm going to collect this money from my, my, you know, my clients and then I'm going to invest it. Right. And then, Hey, I'm just going to grab this little bit. I'll pay it right back. You know, next thing you know, you're going to level seven Ponzi scheme. Yeah. They see that. And that's the thing that's a slippery slope where when you start, even before you like start to slip or whatever, when you start your, you think of, okay, where am right now and going to prison for the Ponzi so you never would have no way I'm going to, you know, I've seen other guys do. It sounds like that would really be the psychology of people that do that. Like all I bet a lot. Well, I don't know cause I haven't, are you, is this a specific example that you read about or something or you just kind of assuming that that's what the mindset is?

Speaker 4:          01:50:37       Yeah. Well, um, I had read about like the slippery slope situation, but it really, it's like two perspectives. One is like when you're in the mix and the the next step or down the slippery slope, the is always totally understandable, right? No one's going to run, know, sound, the alarm. I bet if you looked at the Bernie Madoff where he has had that, I, I would, I would have to read about it, but it would make sense to me that your assumption is correct. That in the beginning he wasn't like, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to rip off a bunch of people. I met at the beginning, you said, you know what? I got these good investments. I'm going to get these people didn't buy in. And then he goes, you know what? I didn't quite make what we were going to make, but I'm just going to go ahead and take some of these other people's money and just distribute it to everyone was kind of happy.

Speaker 4:          01:51:20       And you know, that's where it starts. Yeah. And then you, then you realize you can get away with it and you go on down that road. Yeah. And that, and that's ego by the way, because that's just ego because you're like, I don't want to admit to everybody that, hey, I didn't make the money I promised you so you know what I'm going to do double down, double down. But the tooth perspectives is kind of the, the, um, the thing where when you're in the mix, that one step is like, that's hard to see in a matter of speaking. It's hard to see, cause you're like, Eh, why should I, you know, this guy came in 30 seconds late, so what? I'm going to reprimand him in front of everyone. Come on. You know, like really, you know, so no one's, you know, that's, that's easy to understand.

Speaker 4:          01:52:04       But every last employee never coming in on time. You're like, no way. Impossible. No Way. When I started this, no way I would ever let that happen. But here's the thing, it will happen with that, you know, because of that, because each little step is hard to see. You can't see it. That's why it's like this is the rule and straight up. So you know sticklers of, you know, people like when they're sticklers on the rules. It's kind of like, I guess made me, me like socially the norm is like, hey, he's a stickler, he's a Tightwad, whatever, you know. But I will say this though, you said that there is also the way to lead, like when you heard about Benton Benton want to call the guy out like that, but he would have just given him a look. Right? Right. Don't you think it's a good idea? Don't you think it's really important that we are on time? Yeah. You don't want to call them out in front of everybody or I permitted him, but he still would have been a leader. You still would've led and that's, that's the, that's what we want to do. Yeah. Yeah. So I guess we'll uh, yeah, save the questions from the interwebs for next time.

Speaker 4:          01:53:08       He native American names at the coolest man. They do have the coolest names. But if I, if, if I had another son, I think I named him bloody knife. No. Right. Or what was the other one in the family. One stab. Yeah. Yeah. Dad. Yeah. Native Americans definitely knew how to put their names together. And so what, like what's the, what's the formula? It's like Oh, some significant thing that this guy did and we'll just call them. No, you remember, wouldn't like, cause his name was each from the hand and then they changed it from each, I think it was each from his hand or each from the hand. Once he proved that he was actually a, a, a Badass Warrior, his dad said, cause he had, he had requested the name from, from his uncle because they could both win. They could both walk, they could both walk the distance long and never give up.

Speaker 4:          01:53:53       And so he requested that name and when a, once they fought it, the bid, little big horn, he introduced his son as, this is my son, wouldn't like my, uh, Sarah before they were like, Hey, I wonder how the native Americans get their name. I know how they just, when they do something significant, they just, they just give it to them. They don't make up a name surrounding it. That's their name, what they do. So her friend Abby, she smoked a lot at the time. So her name was Abby smokes a lot. The legitimately, no, oh, that's her native American name. But, but the, in the warrior culture it's way cooler. You know what I mean? Yeah. I like dances with wolves. I mean that's probably not where your culture then you ever seen that movie dancing? I have seen that movie, but it was a long time ago.

Speaker 4:          01:54:44       That was when I went, still went to movies before. I just found them all kind of lame old school for sure. Yeah. All right. Um, well I guess with that, how about you talk about how we can get in the game, getting the game, the game and still a little support the podcast. Maybe it would be nice to learn how to enforcement. If you want to support the podcast, you can do it and this is how, yeah, there's some cool ways. Um, if you don't know already, I would say with supporting this podcast, support yourself. That's, I think that because if you're incapable, how are, you know, if you're not capable of supporting yourself humping to support podcast, how can you support us with that? By the way, we got mixed reviews from the last podcast. I had said something along the lines of, hey, does this take too long?

Speaker 4:          01:55:42       Actually I did. We didn't get mixed reviews. I think the only roof, the only reviews we got were positive. Now there might be some people that just didn't say anything because they were trying to be kind and gentle. Yeah. So that's fine. They press stop right now. The rest of the people that are kind of like the little deep in the game, they're deepen the game. Yeah, that's a good, well, in a way I, and there were some good points that they brought up because, um, oh, I forget who said it, but they were like, there's some nuggets in there. Yeah. No, we don't stop trying to learn. Yeah. While we're talking about things that help us. Right. Correct. We were still trying to figure some stuff out. Yeah. There's some nuggets of information to share that might be dropped at any time. Yeah. And even if not, that's part of the reason why I put the guide, you know, on Youtube.

Speaker 4:          01:56:35       Oh yeah. This is, you guys are done talking about this stuff, so just turn it off. Oh, the whatever the, the Internet stuff. I'll just skip that part. Yeah. You can skip it and it'll tell you where to skip too. So both options are there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because some people might just want to take everything they can from the podcast. That's why I put, um, you know, the timestamp for all the subjects because, you know, look, I like to assume that every 100% of the people, everybody 10 out of 10, like every single word of that, and they like every single subject and they like, I would, I like, I like to think that, but in the event of that not being the case, I don't want them to be all this while I got to sit through echo talking about, you know, Amazon Click throughs and on it, you know, so they have the option.

Speaker 4:          01:57:25       I think that's important. Yeah. We're all here. We're working together. I feel like we're all in this together. You know, we don't need the one guy being, hey, I have a different opinion than you. I have that. Right. And then now I've got to sit through this stuff that you guys like what I'm saying. Well, I think we're taking care of both sides in sure. So, and to do that, you know, of course, like I said, you support yourself supplementation if you're into it. And here's the thing where I didn't think that like Krill oil with supplementation. Here's the thing. It is, and it helps cause that's cause you're, you're now on the chrome on the Krill oil and it, and I have reaped its benefits and um, my, my wife's dad was talking about Krill oil from, oh, fish oil, no, not fish oil.

Speaker 4:          01:58:04       Fish oil is good. Don't get me wrong. It's outstanding. It's just, you know, what's better? Krill oil is what he would say on a time. And I'm like, Eh, yeah, yeah. He's kind of, you know, one of these health like guys and I'm the old message. No marriage. Yeah. So, um, yeah, Krill oil from, from on it. Of course. That's it. That's the main one. They have like the quality, the quality stuff, cheap stuff. No, don't. And He, one might think, oh yeah, of course I'm not going to go get the cheap stuff, but here's the thing. And slept with supplements. Like there is cheap stuff. There's like stuff that straight up doesn't work. Like you might as well be taking chop condensed into pills. It's true. Absolutely true. Chalk you said? Yeah. Okay. Don't do that. Cause it's not like, I don't know something about it being a supplement.

Speaker 4:          01:58:50       It's not rigged. I Dunno something, but on it is all legit, like it has the literature, all that stuff like where they get it. Even the Krill oil is like, you're so excited about where the Krill oil comes from. Always. That's a deal. Like I said, we're all that. You're about to tell us about the environmental friendly ships. You love that. That was kind of a cool video too. You can see. No, I liked it. That obviously left an impression on you and for you to say something, it's a cool video. That's a pretty good compliment. You kind of like cool videos and make them, at least we hope I tell myself that. Yeah, sure. Because a lot of times if we don't make them, you don't make, sometimes you make one every three months and then how do we feel about that there? We don't feel really good about it yet.

Speaker 4:          01:59:32       All right. There you go. I mean, I'm okay. You know, I take your point fully, but back to the Krill oil. It's good. Anyway. What else? Nick Krill oil warrior bars. The shroom tech for performance. You know, if you, if you want the edge, that sounds like kind of commercially, but for real, if you want the edge, if you want to get the edge, if you want, you can alpha brain to elephant brain, go and get them to work in mental edge. Yeah. Anyway. And you can get 10% off. You can support your wallet, which is good to go to [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko the home. Also. Cool way, good way, legit way. It doesn't cost you anything. Way To support this podcast reinforces vodcasts and be in the game. Let's face it, it's much better to be in the game, the game fully in here. How's this, and this is on a side note from this. Um, so you know, like you know, like people will go to like a motivational seminar or something. You don't like this or, or, or listen to a motivational speech. My motivational seminar would be three minutes long.

Speaker 4:          02:00:42       So there's this like party brain where you know it's seek something and then you get the payoff and then it's, it's basically a sense of satisfaction so you can seek no more. So you're, you're satisfied. So people seeking inspiration and motivation, they'll go in, they'll go to a speech or a seminar or something like this and they'll consume the speech or the motivational video or whatever. But they're spectating there. Yeah, they're watching it. Inspecting, yeah, the speech. Sure. Yeah. So the whole lot different. Really the big picture should be, I'm going to get to see this speech, motivation, video, whatever. I'm going to be inspired, motivated. Now I'm going to go take action, right. But to take action, you still have to have a need, you know, that needs to be satisfied. But people, they'll come, they'll view or, or, or, you know, whatever, consume the speech and they will be satisfied because they, they see the speech and they don't take action.

Speaker 4:          02:01:37       And here's the thing, the next speech that comes into town or the next motivational video on youtube, you know, how does the next one or the next time, whoever the person is, I don't know, Tony Robbins or whoever, next time they're coming to town, they're going to go for that good stuff that they got last time. They left a real satisfied with, you know, getting to see, hearing that and you know, viewing that speech, they go, they do it again. They get that sense. Satisfaction still taking no action by the way. Not Good. So it's like it's a weird, it's a messed up cycle. I think the big difference there is, and that's is that those literally you're watching. Yeah. And you're spectating as opposed to getting in the game. Yeah. And see that's it. That's my really my whole point where you know, I'm going to listen to you.

Speaker 4:          02:02:21       You're not saying like, I mean you're saying get after, but you're not saying you can do it. You're not saying that kind of stuff. You know, like I know it goes by, I'm actually, I'm actually not saying you can do it. I'm actually saying do it. Yeah, exactly right. But that's the thing. So really the whole message, whatever it may be, you know, I don't know. Big, don't eat donuts. All this stuff is, the big message here is don't eat donuts. I think it's a bunch of messages, but the key there to them, the whole message is you got to do it. It's not like you can do it, you know, and you're like, Hey, I can do it. I feel good about that fact. I'm good. But this is like you gotta do you gotta go out and do that? You know, you can't just walk.

Speaker 4:          02:03:02       You can just watch. Okay. I think I'm convinced. I'm saying that's the difference. And so you're saying that Amazon, the Amazon shopping, click through the website, Jocko, podcast.com little Amazon link. It definitely helps. And also we're all going to be all up on Amazon for Christmas, for the holiday season, for whatever it is you're going to celebrate when school's off for two weeks and you got to buy a bunch of people presence yet during that time period. That's a good time to support the podcast. It doesn't cost you anything. You Click through Amazon and you make your purchases. The key there is to, to remember it like you need some kind of queue put in your bookmarks or something. Done some kind of cute. That's good. That's the key right there. I think the rest is just, it just kind of, you know, it takes care of itself anyway.

Speaker 4:          02:03:49       And then you can subscribe of course, on iTunes and Youtube and stitcher. Google play. Yep. Yeah. Wherever you might get your podcast from. Subscribe. Yeah. Just subscribe. Write a review. Right. A review. Yeah. Yeah. Those are good men. Their reviews. Yeah. Those are just, those are solid. I like when people get creative. I encourage that for sure. Um, and then of course, of course. Look, if you wear tee shirts, if you wear hoodies, drink coffee or tea of any kind or white teeth anyway, Jocko, store.com you can buy some cool shirts. Uh, if you think they're cool, you look at them,

Speaker 4:          02:04:39       there's going to be more to them than meets the eye looking at a, but if you like how they look, maybe look into down, but here, here's the thing though. I, you know, I'm making like a so mysterious like, Ooh, there's all these layers. How I always say, yeah. Then the Hoodie, one side says discipline other sites. This freedom, if you look, if you pay attention, there's a little equal sign and it's a barcode. Yup. That's made into equals sign. Someone hit me on Twitter and said, hey, you're talking about the layers. Is this equal sign a layer, you know? Yeah. Like is this a little hidden thing?

Speaker 2:          02:05:11       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:05:12       Hey, you're going to leave us here in suspense. Yeah. It is a hidden thing. It's not that big of a deal, but it's a small deal. It's like a double, like the, okay, here. Here it is. So the font, right? Yes. Jocko chose the font. Yes. It would be for any of this. Things started talking with chose the fun. Yeah, because I made the Jocko podcast. You, despite you being a massive, you know, skills with all those programs that do all the design and you have a great graphics mind and all that stuff. Despite all that, I just made this little thing, a little Jocko podcast symbol and I made it on PowerPoint and when it came time to pick the font, I chose this font called OCR, optical, something recognition. Because in my mind I'm always like, okay, part machine, I'm part machine. So this font can be read by machines. Yup. That is why that is why I use this font. Yeah. So yeah, you can look at that at the, I don't know if you told me to look it up, but you said it, you're like, oh yeah, it's cool. It's like, Oh Dang. So I looked it up and yeah, sure enough, it's the first point that they made that computers can. Yes, that's right. That is what it is. That's why I chose it. I'm like, this guy's a deep cool. My, all right, so the Barcode,

Speaker 2:          02:06:35       okay.

Speaker 4:          02:06:36       Yes. Another thing that computer's going to be reading your shirt kind of thing. You're not machine. Yeah. Well, you're wearing them. You're a machine readable. You're a machine. Yes, yes, you're wearing, that's what it is. You can't get rid by computer. So that's kind of the little late. I mean that's just more of like a fun thing for sure. Small layer. Um, but anyway, uh, again Jocko store, that's where all the stuff is. Cool. Rash guards that, hey man, we made the claim 19% improvement. That is yet to be refuted so far. You know, as far as feedback that I've been getting anyway, if you want your improvement because you know what, you know what though? I think that there is legitimacy like actually full, somebody put an article on today about how it compresses the muscle increases circulation so you actually get the legit improvement.

Speaker 4:          02:07:21       I don't know all the science behind it, you know, but bro Science, no, but you know what is, you know how you were saying, you know when you put on like a uniform oh yeah. You or you get a little yes as a ritual. Back to the ritual conversation kind of. And it's like, almost like, it's weird, like when I was young, when I played football at 11 years old and we've got new shoes, football season's here, new shoes. Oh, I couldn't wait to go to practice. I'm going to be faster few months, man. My shoes are dirty. I hate practice. But you get new shoes, you want to go practice, you get new workout gear. You're like, Dang, I'm going go. You get a new rash guard, you want to go train. And you knew, right? You get a new Geek,

Speaker 1:          02:08:02       you want to try it. Yeah. So that's kind of, that's maybe a factor as well. There's a little plastic. Oh yeah. Plus Placebo. Sorry. Yeah, placebo factor. Yeah. And that's, I call it getting after it. So chocolate [inaudible] dot com uh, w some women's stuff, some women's tee shirts coming out soon. Oh, we now, now that you say that, they better be actually coming out. So, you know, I think my, my clock is counting down my Debbie clock. Debbie gave me like a countdown mine straight up dead. Right. You know, she gave me one month, she's leading up the chain of command. Respect you respect on though. But you can also get some Jocko white tea if you want to drink some tea. That tastes really good. If you haven't tried it yet, it doesn't taste like tea and it doesn't taste like anything else. It tastes like something really good.

Speaker 1:          02:08:54       So give it a shot. And a lot of people have replaced every other beverage in their diet with Jocko white tea. And on top of that we've got a little something new coming out that can be used for tea or for coffee or for milk or for cream. And it's a big old mug. So those would be on Amazon. And the Mug, it's just a big black mug. And then written on the Mug is just says get after it. So Yep, you can, you can get one of those. It also says approved. It was approved in fact by me. So you get those mugs and they're pretty cool. And then also you get the book extreme ownership, which I wrote with my brother late Babin and um, pick it up. You know what a lot of like what I did is when people buy it for themselves and then three days later after they get done reading it, they buy four more for the people that are on their team and then they buy one for their boss and then they buy one for the five people that are in their peers team and they just spread the word because they want to make their life easier by having people getting after it all around them and take an extreme ownership.

Speaker 1:          02:10:06       And um, if you do want to kind of keep, keep cruising with, you know, with Echo Charles and myself, you can find this actually on the interwebs, on the interwebs, on Twitter, on also on Instagram. And also we're are kind of all up on the Facebook, Facebook if you want to get that echo is at Charles and I am at jockowillink and

Or you know what? There's plenty of people that hit me up and they say, Hey, you know what? I gotta do a bunch of stupid administrative tasks today and guess what? I'm going to line them up and I'm going to crush them. So wherever you are on today, on that Spec,
