Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 100 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. And we have a guest with us tonight who is in large part responsible for this podcast existing in the first place, who has provided massive support behind pretty much everything I've done, including books and podcasts and events and all this other stuff that I've been getting after for the last couple of years since I departed the shadows and stepped into the normal world. In fact, this is the person that pulled me from the shadows into the normal world. Mr Tim Ferris. Tim, welcome to the show. Thank you for having me Jack off. And we have, you know, an interesting state right now you do because you just got done with a 10 day silent retreat and a five day fast embedded in there somewhere, right? I did. So it was my first 10 day. You know what? Like you know what, my notes weren't here after I said that. My notes are dude question mark like, dude, cause that's what that makes me think. Just like, dude, okay, tell us about it a little bit. And I know you'll probably cover it later, but

Speaker 2:          00:01:22       it was in retrospect, probably layering a few too many things on top of one another. But it was my first meditation retreat, also my first silent retreat combined and consisted of 10 days of waking up at five 30 and I support that part beginning, I know it's sleeping in, but starting at five 30 I hadn't woken up with the stars in a while and then sitting for 45 minutes of meditation, walking for 45 minutes of meditation and doing that until 9:00 PM with the exception of meals. But as you mentioned, I fasted for the first five days out of 10 because I wanted to see how that affected my state and I sat during meals effectively, meaning meditated during those times as well. And it was a, an intense, unexpectedly intense experience because it unlearn is your psyche in a fashion that I hadn't experienced before.

Speaker 2:          00:02:21       Since you have no distractions and you're not permitted to read, there's no music, there's no talking, you're discouraged from any writing. There are no devices and that means there's no real escape from whatever is ricocheting inside your own head. And uh, as you go through the passing days, you drop into deeper layers of your personality and the stories that you've constructed for yourself as well as direct experience and memories that you haven't thought of in my case. 20, 25 years, 30 years, 35 years in some cases, very vivid, intense memories that come back. And so people have a very difficult time at points and the teachers are there every other day to interact on a one on one basis to ensure that people don't have a complete psychotic break. I suppose. Did you hear random question, but would you hear people like crying in their rooms or whatever?

Speaker 2:          00:03:26       Heard people crying? Uh, definitely hurt people crying. People went through a lot of pain and there were sublime experiences as well in moments of deep clarity or, uh, alleviation of suffering. But I think that I was actually just looking forward to describing the experience to our mutual friend, Dr Peter Attia, who may be the most like cerebral, intense, impatient analytical person I've ever met to a degree that even I find hilarious, which is difficult to achieve in this world, in this world, in this life. Uh, and his level of obsession and perseverating on diff, on concepts endlessly, uh, makes me want to do a second retreat with Peter when he's not allowed to tell me how he's feeling. Because I think the more you have run your life through your prefrontal Cortex, the harder you fall. And, uh, I would not recommend it for most people because I would have left the retreat three or four times, probably were it not for one particular teacher who had decades of experience with tens of thousands of retreatants because I felt like I was going to leave in worse shape than I came in.

Speaker 2:          00:04:55       That I had regressed to a very reactive emotional state and that it was going to be a huge handicap when I left. I felt like I was regressing tremendously and he was able to right the ship a little bit along the way. But if, if he had not been there and I had left even on day nine, I remember I was like, people are supposed to be in this deep state of bliss. Or at least that was my perception. I feel like I've just been rubbed raw and all these nerves that I've numbed from difficult experiences in childhood and so on have just been exposed at the surface. Uh, so I think it's a, I think it requires a high level of supervision. And this may not be the, the forum for discussing what I'm about to say, but for those people who have the experience, it might make some sense. It had the characteristics of a very, a very strong psychedelic experience, but laid out over 10 days where there's no escape. So instead of ripping off the Bandaid, you are being exposed to facets of your life and character that perhaps you have not faced in decades. So yeah, it was a fun 10 days.

Speaker 3:          00:06:20       We get when you do, when you get sleep deprivation, which I've gone through some insignificant sleep deprivation, you know, you have those kind of um, you know, you take a trip without leaving the farm type situations. And, and for me it was nothing, nothing crazy or anything. You know, I remember seeing stop signs in the ocean and uh, traffic lights in the ocean and stuff like that. So not crazy crazy, but it's not, it wasn't some psychological sort of unpacking where I was meeting my former self or anything like that. Um, but yeah, you definitely that, that's when I hear, cause I've never tried psychedelic drugs and when I wouldn't, people talk about them. To me it does not sound fun to me because I, I think that where I think that where I would end up would not be a happy place and I don't really need to hang out there very much.

Speaker 2:          00:07:11       And I should, I should also say that I don't, in the case of the silent retreat, or in the case of Psychedelics, do it for fun and in, I've had a few people ask me, did you enjoy your experience? I had a few staffers afterwards. They're like, oh, did you enjoy your treat? And I'm like, I found it valuable. I wouldn't use the word enjoy.

Speaker 3:          00:07:34       Yeah, yeah. Well, you, you, obviously, you're going to unpack this thing and I'm sure you'll do awesome episode talking about it. As you look back on it right now, your brain is

Speaker 2:          00:07:47       still, it's still 70% there. And they told us at the end, which I thought was very appropriate because it applies to so many things. They said, uh, or one of the teachers said, you're, you, you think you're normal right now and you're not. You've very hypersensitive. You're retreat is half done. So it'll take 10 days, the equivalent amount of time to reintegrate and get re tethered. And I remember thinking to myself, I have fucking book launch calming. I don't have 10 days to gingerly walk my way back to reality. But, uh, nonetheless, uh, that's true for so much, right? I mean, it's, if you have a book and your book is 90% done, I remember I told, uh, a more seasoned writer when I was writing my second book. I said, I'm 90% done. They said, oh, congratulations. The only 50.

Speaker 3:          00:08:31       That's the trim work. It's just like building a house. They stayed trim work that all that little stuff that takes longer than you think it's going to take. Well, so to just set the stage a little bit, um, number one, you are on this podcast before, which was an awesome episode and you talked about some of your heart experiences growing up and going through college and actually having suicidal thoughts and beyond suicidal plans. That was podcast number 50 and it really helped out a lot of people. I got an immense amount of great feedback from people and so thank you for doing that. And on that podcast, we also briefly discussed a novel called Musashi, and it's just this incredible book that you'd read. And I had read and the ending of the book is just full on epic and it's also a thousand page book and it takes the, the whole, the, the, the, the ending of the book is literally the last page and a half.

Speaker 3:          00:09:29       So that's it. You have to read a thousand pages to get to this thing, this ending. And we decided on that podcast that we would do, do that book for podcast 100. So here we are and we're going to talk about the book Musashi by Eeg, a Yoshikawa Agee, Yoshi color. And I'm just going to accept the fact that I will be getting my Japanese pronunciation corrected all day long. I won't correct it unless you want me to correct. Well, maybe after I'd get done with something you could tell me it's just going to suck. That's all there is to it.

Speaker 3:          00:10:08       Now the book, so if you don't know anything about it, Miyamoto Musashi, great Japanese swordsman and he wrote the book, the Book of five rings. Um, and I actually covered that book on podcast number 80. So if you haven't listened to 50 and if you haven't listened to 80, go listen to those too. And it'll give you some background, which I don't want to spend a bunch of time on there cause he's spent a bunch of time on it on that podcast. But here's the basic understanding of whom we saw. She was born into a Samurai family around 1584 fought his first dual at the age of 13 against a grown man who he killed by throwing him to the ground and beating him with a Bokken, Boykin, Boykin, Boykin. Oh, this is going to get them. But I wouldn't sort of see, I should've just said wooden sword.

Speaker 3:          00:10:55       And we would have been good in that, in, and then through his life, he traveled and he did all kinds of things and he fought 60 sword duels. I used to think that they were all to the death, but they actually weren't right. There's some of them were just like, if you could submit you, you know, the opponent could just say, Yup, you one, and you could agree you beforehand what the rules of engagement would be. Oh, okay. So they could have a discussion and determine the extent to which you could inflict damage on the other person. So they weren't all to the death. They could have a, basically a gentleman's agreement, like, let's not kill each other today. It's only do this one, two broken bones and handicapping. How do you gotta do you gotta that's a hardcore conversation. Yeah. But how do you, how do you come off not looking like the wolf? You don't want to be the first one to say, hey, let's just break it down. Let's just break bones. You know, you should just be like, no, we'll go to the death. That's it. That's weird. Uh, but yeah, so, but a bunch of them war to the death, a lot of them were to the death and again, um, that then he got done with that, all that fighting and he wrote the book of five rings. He also wrote a book or up like steps called Dual Dakota. Close Japanese has this,

Speaker 2:          00:12:12       this stuttered content. And for people who were wondering, why am I the Japanese conciliary it's because I lived in Japan. It's my first trip overseas ever, uh, from 15 to 16 as an exchange student where I was the only knot. I was the only American in a a 5,000 person, Japanese high school where I also wore a uniform and did judo and lived with a Japanese family for an entire year. So that is why I'm commenting on Japanese dope. Godel dope go. [inaudible] is a alone coal is to walk, let's say Dole is wage. It's the same goal from judo or [inaudible], which is way, so it's the way of walking alone.

Speaker 3:          00:12:54       Yeah. And I should have said that. That's the reason why I thought it would be awesome to have you on here because you do have this knowledge not only of the language, but of the culture. And you did this, you've done a bunch of weird stone. Cool. Yeah. Y'All was [inaudible] Japanese horseback archery, which by the way also pretty dangerous. Turns out. Yeah. And so that's what, that's why I wanted to have you on here because you've got massive amount of knowledge that I don't have. So again in that, that Duco close enough. We're going with it. Let's roll with it. This is covered in podcast 80 as well. And also this is a spoiler alert and I guess I should do this every time I do a book cause I do books on here a lot and I always tell what's going to happen. But for this one, this is a spoiler alert because the book, it does have the most epic ending.

Speaker 3:          00:13:43       I think it most be, it might be the most epic ending of any book. I honestly think that it might be that and we are going to cover it. So if you want to read this book then and we gave you about a year to read it, but if you haven't read it yet, maybe you're not going to read it and you should just listen. But if you do want to read the book and get the full satisfaction of it, then stop right now and then go read Musashi. Take another year to read it, which is a thousand pages long, and then come back and listen to us. So can I say one thing? Absolutely. This book

Speaker 2:          00:14:17       and way we can get back into some of the history, but I bought this book. I have a paperback version decades ago in Tokyo at a bookstore called Kinokuniya in Shinjuku. It's a huge bookstore. It's, I want to say at least four floors, maybe six or seven. And I carried it around giving myself scoliosis for years and years because I was so intimidated by this thing. It's, it's a few inches thick. The paper is like onion skin. And I was like, Oh God, I just can't. Every time I pick it up, it's, Oh God, I can't get into this. Once I started, I could not put it down and I finished it in a couple of days. I mean, it's, it's that

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       good. So it's don't be intimidated by this by the size. It's not, it's not as much of a, a slog as you would expect once you, once you get into it, you just get sucked in. And the reading. The writing is beautiful. It's very clean, very clean writing. And the story is, that's another thing I should say too, is that, so there's a bunch of intertwining narratives in there about a bunch of different people and characters and the AA. They all are interesting and impactful and they all add to the story. Obviously for a couple hour podcasts. We can't get into all of those. And, and really we'll be hitting like this, this the main plot line I guess. But there's all these other things that are, that are going on that we're just don't have time to touch on that are, that are really great to read about.

Speaker 1:          00:15:40       And there's so many, if this guy would have been a screenwriter, oh my God. Yeah. The dialogue alone. The book worth it. Yeah. It's, it's just a great book and that's that. Um, I guess we might as well get into it a little bit. And when we did, when I did podcast 80 with a book of five rings, I started with the beginning of this book and I said, when I did that, that when we do this book, I'm reading it again cause it's so legit. Uh, so he Rigo Taqa Zone. Alright, Tuck Hazel, Hazel [inaudible] lay among the corpses. There were thousands of them. The whole world's gone crazy. He thought dimly a man might as well be a dead leaf floating in the autumn breeze. He himself looked like one of the lifeless bodies surrounding him. He tried to raise his head, but could only lift it a few inches from the ground.

Speaker 1:          00:16:42       He couldn't remember ever feeling so weak. How long have I been here? He wondered, flies came buzzing around his head. He wanted to brush them away, but couldn't even muster the energy to raise his arm. It was stiff, almost brittle like the rest of his body. I must have been out for quite a while. He thought wiggling one finger at a time. Little did he know he was wounded with two bullets, lodged firmly in his thigh. Low dark clouds shifted ominously across the sky the night before, sometime between midnight and dawn, a blinding raid had drenched the plane of Second Shahara. It was now past noon on the 15th of the ninth month of 1600 though the typhoon had passed now and then fresh torrents of rain would fall on the corpses on the tick. Asos up turned face. Each time it came, he opened and closed his mouth like a fish trying to drink in the droplets. It's like the water they wipe a dying man's lips with he savoring

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       each bit of moisture cause head was numb. His thoughts, the fleeting shadows of delirium, his side had lost. He knew that much. How do Yaki? Supposedly an ally had been secretly in league with the eastern army and when it turned on Mitsunari his troops at twilight, the tide of the battle turn to

Speaker 4:          00:18:15       okay,

Speaker 3:          00:18:15       he then attack the armies of the other commanders. You Kita Shimazu Konishi and the collapse of the Western army was complete and only half a days fighting. The question of who would henceforth rule the country was settled. It was Tokugawa Ieyasu the powerful, he dies demo images of his sister and the old villagers floated before his eyes. I'm dying. He thought without a tinge of sadness, is this what it's really like? He felt drawn to the piece of death, like a child mesmerized by a flame. So that's how the book kind of kicks off. And

Speaker 3:          00:19:07       this guy was just born on the battlefield basically and is fighting in these savage battles as, as, as a kid, as a kid. Um, and I, I think it's interesting that you start the book where a guy's about to die, you know, and I think that's, there's something significant to that and it's not the only time in the book where he's about to die. He, he faces these bad situations over and over again. And again, we just have to fast forward through massive chunks of this book. And I was just going to make one comment. Absolutely.

Speaker 2:          00:19:47       There's people who are wondering why we're saying Tuck Zol. So talk is all is, is represented by the same two characters that can also be read as Musashi. So there are different readings for characters and Japanese depending on if they are adapted Chinese readings or native Japanese readings. So Musashi is the, what would be called the, the [inaudible] or the Japanese reading and talk is all same. Two characters would be the Chinese reading basically, I mean the Chinese origin reading, which is called on Naomi. So it's the same person talk, Gisele and then Musashi, the Japanese and Chinese characters related linguistically, they are very, very similar. So the uh, the Japanese took Chinese characters, which they call congee and they converted them into to what are referred to as silver berries. So we have an alphabet, a, B, c, d. We have vowels and consonants. In Japanese, they have what are called silver.

Speaker 2:          00:20:47       Barry's meaning they are syllables instead of individual letters to have cocky, Kooky, cool mommy, mommy mill saw sheet. The so, and uh, which is part of the reason why Japanese have so much trouble with almost every language. They kinda got robbed when like the gods were handing out. Sounds so they have trouble with a lot of languages, including English. But nonetheless, uh, the, uh, those were simplified versions of the characters. So for instance, the character for, uh, that you could say represents peace in shine is which is an, so if for instance, like, uh, east, the word in Chinese would be untrendy. So I've spent time in China as well. In Japanese, it's unzipped, it's, it's very similar. And then the character for [inaudible] is, has a roof and then a woman under a roof. And that represents peace. That was then modified into the sound op, the vowel.

Speaker 2:          00:21:46       Ah, and uh, there are fewer strokes in that. So that's some of the framework for the Japanese writing systems. If two syllable trees and then the Chinese characters that they use, the languages are not mutually intelligible though, are they? Not at all. Now there are certain words that are not terribly close, but maybe what you would find say between Portuguese and Spanish and drive, for instance. So you would have a word, like a telephone, which is literally a electric talk, which is, you know, and even electricity as cloud. And a dragon underneath. It was kind of cool. But anyway, the, that's they wa in Japanese Dm Guac and Mandarin and then Joan Quad Korean, because a lot of the words in Korea, we're also borrowed from the Chinese characters. Uh, but beyond that, the grammar, everything else is completely, completely different. And W I think are actually in here cover where he gets, where he comes up with a new name or when he decides to take the new name.

Speaker 2:          00:22:56       Yeah. So the guy that I'm talking about in the beginning, as Tim just pointed out that his Musashi Tuck, Hazel Hazel, it's a tough one. The zone, the zone is a long, so tuck, Tuck, Azule Taco zone there. We got his Musashi. Exactly. And you'll find that out shortly for those people who are watching the video. That is talk, Gisele and Musashi, those two characters. Okay. Anyway, what, so what does that, what does the rest of that thing and say it's a bookmark. What does this, this is the wrapping that was put around the cover of this book in the English section in Kinokuniya bookstores so that people could figure out what the content was without, without having to read the back jacket in English. So this is, you know, Musashi, Loomio, orthotic coke, honeymoon, got glue, so on and so, and then Miyamoto Musashi and then Yoshikawa age is all here. And then a little description on the back

Speaker 1:          00:23:53       are there just copies of this everyday. Everyone read this in Japan. This, I mean

Speaker 2:          00:24:00       he misremembering this, but I remember at the time looking at this book and reading about the, as they would call it, on the back cover of the best selling Samurai epic. And somewhere reading this book has sold something absurd, like 20 million plus copies in a country of a, whatever it might be, 150 million people. That seems now that I've been through the book process a few times, like it cannot be true, but it is a very, very, very famous book in Japan. And everybody's going to know who, uh, they would say Miyamoto Musashi. They would give the last name first. Everyone is going to know who this guy is and they have hundreds of comic books and so on. Historical comic books, fictional comic books that have been written about

Speaker 1:          00:24:54       Misashi. Yeah. And this thing originally came out in a series, I think in, um, 1939 or 1933 or 1935 or something like that. And it originally came out as a series, I think in like a magazine or something.

Speaker 2:          00:25:11       You're going to get it right. Quite possibly could be the case. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:25:16       I'm pretty sure. So we'll go with it. All right. Now we are going to get to a point where, again, we're fast forwarding it and at this point, Musashi, she's been accused of murder and he's been hung from a tree and Tequan Tequan yeah. Pakwan yes. Talk one is sort of this kind of traveling priests on any sort of counseling and advising and yeah, just sort of counseling and advising Musashi that at this point, and he's kind of wandering around as Musashi has now been accused of murder and hung up up in this tree where they're gonna eventually kill him. And here we, here we go, go into the book, Talk One, save me techie. Zos Cry for help was loud and plaintive. The branch was beginning to tremble as though it as though the whole tree were weeping. I want to be a better man. I realize how important it is, what a privilege it is to be born human. I'm almost dead, but I understand what it means to be alive and now that I know my whole life will consist of being tied to this tree. I can't undo what I've done. You're finally coming to your census for the first time in your life. You're talking like a

Speaker 3:          00:26:43       human being. I don't want to die. Taka Zilla cried. I want to live. I want to go out. Try again. Do everything right this time his body convulsed with is sobbing on. Please help me. Help me. The monk shook his head. Sorry, Taco zone. It is out of my hands. It is the law of nature. You can't do things over again. That's life. Everything in it is for keeps everything. You can't put your head back on after the enemy's cut it off. That's the way it is. Of course, I feel sorry for you, but I can't undo that rope because it wasn't me who tied it. It was you. All I can do is give you some advice, faced death bravely and quietly say a prayer and hope some someone bothers to listen and for the sake of your ancestors, tech azo have the decency to die with a peaceful look on your face. The clatter of Taco Juan's sandals faded into the distance. He was gone and talk as though cried no more. Following the spirit of the monks advice, he shut the eyes that had just experienced a great awakening and forgot everything you forgot about living and dying and under the myriad of tiny stars lay perfectly still as the night breeze side through the tree. He was cold, very cold.

Speaker 3:          00:28:20       I mean obviously wrote a book called extreme ownership where you're responsible for your actions and you need to take responsibility for things in your lives. But this thing where he says, I can't untie the rope because it wasn't me. That was that tied it. It was you. You put yourself in this position and that's, that's the way it is. You want, your head is cut off. You can't put it back on Musashi or Tuck. Azul gets, he does crazy stuff too, right? He's, he's young and he does crazy things. And one of the crazy things he does is his sister's in some kind of jail or something and he just like a tax it and any loses and he, they gets arrested and he gets put in prison for three years. And at this point he's getting released from jail after he's been in jail for three years.

Speaker 3:          00:29:05       And again, obviously I'm the, I just skipped three years of this guy's jail time, which actually is pretty short in the book. They don't spend a lot of time in jail. Uh, but he's been in jail for three years. He gets out and here we, he's, he's having a conversation and here we go. [inaudible] smiled silently. I want to wander about on my own for awhile and then talk. Juan who's back, that's where he's having the conversation with. Sorry. He says you should change your first name to Tacoma interjected. Why not read the Chinese characters of your name as Musashi instead of Taco? You can keep writing your name the same as before.

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       It's only fitting that everything should begin anew on this day of your rebirth. Miyamoto Musashi. It's a good name, a very good name. We should drink to it. The following day, they both left the castle. Musashi was talking, Musashi was taking his first steps into a new life, a life of discipline and training in the martial arts during his three year incarceration, he had resolved to master the art of war.

Speaker 5:          00:30:12       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:30:12       Explain the, the first, the first, last name thing. [inaudible] motors. That that's a place, right? Or is it, is it a, in this case, in many cases it refers to originally a place. So my understanding is that Miyamoto refers to whether it's a town or a village or pro, not province, he would be smaller where his family originated from. It's not always the case, but even if you look at English names, you find the same thing, right? So it could have been an English end in a lot of languages. It often relates to an early vocation. So Ferris for instance, comes from Ferris, like f e r r o, u. S like Ferris oxide iron. Because way back in the day, at some point my family worked with metals and that's where the name comes from. Uh, is Miyamoto the first name or the last name? [inaudible] is the last name. So similarly, the authors of this, the author of this book, Agee Yoshikawa, the Yoshikawa is the last name.

Speaker 5:          00:31:15       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:31:15       And why do I say Miyamoto Musashi.

Speaker 5:          00:31:18       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:31:19       The Japanese always say the last name first. Okay. They say the family name first, except for in this guy's case, eg what the, so this is [inaudible] got it. Yeah, that makes sense. Yup. Making some progress. So for instance, in jail, very slow progress. Intellectual Capability maxing out. Yes. In, in, in Japan for instance, even as a young kid, when you're talking to your friends, you, you would never, I can't recall even once saying someone's first name, you would just say, uh, boy, you know, Yamamoto Polaka like you would, so I'll call you Ferris. Yeah. You called me with my case because Ferris was psyche. Not Confusing, but they knew I was American and Tim like Teemu as they would say, uh, we shorter. So they just called me teemu. Yeah. Tim was on the team. Can you get that in the military too, where everyone kind of gets introduced by your last name and everyone for a while. Everyone just kind of calls each other, you know, Willink, Ferris, Charles, you know. Right. So, but that's how they address each other pre, normally. Oh yeah, the all the time. Yeah. With the exception of saying my host family where I'm dealing with everybody who has the same last name, you can get very, so then I'll

Speaker 3:          00:32:39       call them by their first names. Check, check. All right, now this book does have a romantic interest in it. I hate to inform everyone and it's so it's, it's absolutely worth coming covering because it's the, the way it gets handled throughout is just freaking epic. So his romantic interest is a woman named Oh yes. See, um, Osu and he's, again, we can't cover the whole story, but this is his romantic interest and we will ease he's, she's in and out of the story. And the main point is that even though he's desires her and wants to be with her at the same time, there's something that's more important to him and that is the way of the sword. So here we go. Back to the book, Musashi covered her small white hand, which was resting on the railing with his own. Listen, he said, plaintively I beg of you. Just stop and think. What's there to think about? I told you I've just become a new man. I stayed in that musty hole for three years. I read books, I fought. I screamed and cried. Then suddenly the light dawned. I understood what it means to be human. I have a new name, Miyamoto Musashi. I want to dedicate myself to training and discipline. I want to spend every moment of every day working to improve myself. I now know how far I have to go. If you choose to bind your life to mind, you'll never be happy.

Speaker 3:          00:34:20       There will be nothing but hardship and it won't get any easier. As it goes along, it'll get more and more difficult.

Speaker 3:          00:34:29       When you talk like that, I feel closer to you than ever. Now I'm convinced I was right. I've found the best man I could ever find. Even if I searched for the rest of my life. He saw he was just making things worse. I'm sorry. I just can't take you with me. Well then I'll just follow along. As long as I don't interfere with your training, what harm would it do? You won't even know I'm around. Musashi could find no answer. I won't bother you. I promise he remained silent. It's all right then, isn't it? Just wait here. I'll be back in a second and I'll be furious if you try and sneak away. Oh two ran off towards the basket weaving shop. Musashi thought of ignoring everything and running too in the opposite direction though the will was there. His feet couldn't move. Otu looked back and called remember, don't try to sneak off. She smiled, showing her dimples and Musashi inadvertently nodded. Satisfied by this gesture. She disappeared into the shop if he was going to escape. This was the time his heart told him so, but his body was still shackled by Otsuka. Pretty dimples and pleading eyes. How sweet she was.

Speaker 4:          00:35:43       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:35:43       It was certain no one in the world would save his sister or safe. His sister loved him so much and it wasn't as though he disliked her. He looked at the sky. He looked into the water, desperately gripped the railing, troubled and confused. Soon tiny bits of wood began floating from the bridge into the flowing stream.

Speaker 4:          00:36:07       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:36:07       Oh, to reappeared on the bridge in new straw, sandals, light yellow leggings and a large traveling hat tied under the Chin with the Crimson Ribbon. She'd never looked more beautiful, but Musashi was nowhere to be seen.

Speaker 4:          00:36:23       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:36:24       With a cry of shock, she burst into tears. Then her eyes fell upon the spot on the railing from which the chips of wood had fallen there. Carved with a point of a dagger was the clearly inscribed a message. Forgive me, forgive me.

Speaker 3:          00:36:47       I love how it measured. His emotions are in the pros. He clearly did not dislike her. Yeah, that's heavy. That's like, that's like, I love you. And is it the speech? It is. It is. But yeah, that is the, that is the nightmare scenario for women right there. That is it. That's an abandonment issue is number one. And having spent, um, you know, quite some time in the, in the seal teams, you know, this, this, this is a real thing. You know, guys, they have to choose between this girl and their job. And of course some guys can make it work and blah blah blah. And I did a pretty decent job of making it work. But I'm telling you, it's a hard, there's a 90% divorce rate in the seal teams in the military tie. So this is a real choice that guys had to make and it's, it can be really hard.

Speaker 3:          00:37:33       And that's just a nightmare scenario. And, and honestly what's jacked up is that the guys are actually trying to do the right thing. They're actually trying, they're, they're looking at a girl saying, look, you don't want to sign up for this. Like this is not going to be fun. And you know, of course people fall in love and they goes, emotions start to take over ridiculously. And, and you know, it's one of those things, but that's a nightmare scenario for a girl. Yeah. And for a guy, I think this is the weird thing, I can't speak guy girl. I can't speak for girls cause I'm not one. But for most guys, they read that and they kind of go, yeah, at least I do get it. I mean, I'm, I'm echoes a softy. He does. I've, I've been drinking the, the Japan and Samurai Koolaid for so long that I'm just like, oh, I get it.

Speaker 3:          00:38:29       Yeah. I bet. If we had, you know, those little alum like meters where people can vote. Yeah. Or, or like this spike on the presidential debates where things would be like, people really agree with this thing. If you had that right there, and males between the ages of 18 and 35 we're hearing that. They're like, yeah, yeah. Walkaway, dude. That's what they're thinking. Wouldn't surprise me. Yeah. For the seal teams, that's totally normal culture. Oh yeah, Bro. You got to choose the teams. You gotta choose the teams first, you know? Oh, you didn't, you don't want to, you know, don't want to put her through this. So that's kind of messed up. But it's the reality. Sorry. Well, especially imagine if your, your intention is to go dual people to the death repeatedly. I mean, the odds are not in your favor. You eventually, someone's going to be better than you. What was that? Do you have that section mark, that you were reading about how he felt about people that had gotten the upper hand on him because that was pretty epic. Ah, let me find it so, and that way people don't have to listen to 'em bad Japanese premise. Let's see. Let's see. All right, here we go.

Speaker 2:          00:39:44       The adversaries he hit, I'm not going to do as good a job of reading is Jocko. He's bad. He's well-practiced. Plus he has the audio book, Voice of Jocko Willink. The adversaries he had defeated, even the ones he had killed her half killed always disappeared from his mind, like so much froth, but he couldn't forget anyone who got the better of him in any way or for that matter. Anyone in whom he sensed an overpowering presence. That was the line. I underline it. Anyone in whom he sensed an overpowering presence. Men like that dwelt in his mind like living spirits, and he thought constantly of how one day he might be able to overshadow them.

Speaker 3:          00:40:22       Yeah, that's, that's deep right there. Drive. And that's also ego issues clearly. Oh yeah. Those are people are hard to deal with and when and unless you recognize that it's your own ego that's causing these problems cause a lot of people are so intimidated by, I've seen that many times where you know, you get like a young seal that's a real bad ass and he's coming up and they're some of the, some of the senior seals maybe that are also bad ass. You know, basically you get two alpha males in a room and it can be problematic. And unless one of them real, as the old guy realizes, usually it's the old guy that realizes, hey this is a young buck coming up. What I should do is try and help him instead of try and keep them down cause I'm jealous. And that's what Musashi's has that attitude of, you know, he does, he didn't care about the people that are, that he beats. Yeah. Yeah. He's like the Steve Jobs of Samurai. Yeah. Actually I was thinking about this on your podcast. It would be awesome if you did. Like, if you, if you did like the job's book and you, you read parts of it and you've thought about it, I thought, I think that'd be pretty cool. Yeah. You know, I've, I've, I've, I've considered it because I've, I've listened to

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       a lot of your episodes, uh, as you're going through books and I have all my highlights. Furthermore, and you saw this earlier, I showed you my index that I created for your book field manual. And I also have, I noticed this is what I was looking at is you're reading my own index at the beginning of Musashi with the page numbers and things that I found interesting. So I have everything locked and loaded and ready to go for all of these books that I've read. I think it'd be awesome, especially because like, for instance, you know, I do books about war primarily because that's what I can relate to them the most. But you know, if you were reading business books and, and you were talking about, you know, what these people went through and, and then you could relate it to what you did and how, you know, it's just, I think it'd be, I liked, I liked the idea of biographies. I, because I recently, not to digress too far, but I interviewed Walter Isaacson who I know actually who wrote the job's book and because he just finished a new book on Da Vinci, which is spectacular. And Yeah, I actually noticed that book, um, because it was out selling my book, whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:42:38       Walter, well good for you all to, we're going to go off the rails for a second, but, so every year or every time I have a book come out, there's unit Garton who writes cookbooks, barefoot Contessa, who for whatever reason always comes out in the same week. And then he's just like lining the wall. She has her own walls from the bookstore. So I'm like, how am I going to compete against walls? I'm trying to get an end cap and then also on Amazon, every time I have a book come out, literally every time I took a screenshot of it a couple of weeks ago and I said, man, this book is so hardcore, it's so undefeatable giraffes can't dance to children's book. And it's, it's uh, it is, it is always just slaying my books on Amazon. Fortunately not the same category for the best seller lists, but uh, yes, biographies and uh, and going through those to tie in pieces would also be fun because I could, I could compare my mindset in state.

Speaker 2:          00:43:41       Uh, my development at the time that I made the highlights with my observations now 100%. And I think again, I think that would be, I think a lot of people would get a lot out of it because you got something out of it and then you get to look back on it. You get three perspectives, you get the person's respected perspective, you get your old perspective and you get your current perspective. That's pretty legit. Yeah, that's a lot of growth and knowledge coming from, you know, pretty quick statement. So I just want to read one more since it's right across from what I just read, the anyone in whom he sensed an overpowering presence. And I don't have the full context here because I'm just looking at independent highlights, but it appears that Misashi has been approached by several men in some environment and they're asking him questions, a small talk, Musashi wondered why

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       they were taking up their time and his, with their small talk, it became apparent that he would not find out unless he asked. So the next time there was a break in the conversation, he said, presumably you came because you have some business with me. These lines of dialogue is awesome. They feigned surprise at the very idea, but soon admitted that they had come on what they regarded as a very important mission. And it goes on and on. There's so many good lines in there. So many good lines. Here's a good, here's a good part. Moving along in the story here. He has throughout this thing. It's, uh, when, when I was a kid and you remember you'd watch what was the Saturday morning or one day they'd have Kung Fu theater, I think it was actually called Kung Fu theater and on Kung Fu theater, it was always these, you know, my school against your school and, and, and you know, he got all that.

Speaker 3:          00:45:26       That seems neat, but that's real. Like that stuff really happened. And he had these feuds with various schools of martial arts, like you'd seen Kung Fu theater. And in this particular one he had gone and kind of whooped up on this one school and then, but like the leader wasn't there. And so he writes a letter and here's the letter that Musashi rights, which is to Yoshioka Yoshioka beautiful name, Yoshi, that isn't Yoshi, call it character. What does Yoshi mean, Yoshi? I'd have to look at it saying, I, I, I don't recall off him, but Yoshida Yoshida, this Yoshi that Yoshi, no ya all that same Yoshi, and this is Yoshioka. So here's what Musashi writes the letter. He says, I am told that you and your disciples are searching for me. As it happens. I am on the, I'm now on the Yamato High Road. My intention being to travel around in general area of Egan [inaudible] for about a year to continue my study of sorts and ship.

Speaker 3:          00:46:32       I did not wish to change my plans at this time, but since I regret as much as you do that I was unable to meet you during my previous visit to your school. I should like to inform you that I shall certainly be back in the capitol by the first or second month of next year. Between now and then, I expect to improve my technique considerably. I trust that you yourself will not neglect your practice. It would be a great shame if Yoshioka Kempos flourishing school were to suffer an a second defeat, like the one that sustained last time I was there. In closing, I send my respectful wishes for your continued health. Mostly Musashi, so I love the little jabs. You're flourishing school, wink. Ha Ha. It's so jacked up, but yeah, that's the old school talking smack, right? Respect let's I kind of what they do in the British parliament, right? Or Hamilton if you see the play thing. I haven't

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       seen it like with kindest regards, after you basically say, I want to meet you and do with you and shoot you in the face with kindest regards and wishes for your continued health. You know, we've lost that. There's something to that, isn't there? You know, like, can't you just have a feud and still be respectful to someone? I respect your intellect and your capacities and yet I will stop at nothing until I destroy it. So this is another, a dojo storm, which again, this is a modern term that I think Jiu Jitsu people created. I don't know, did you ever use the term go to heard that before? I've never heard Dojo storm before. Oh, Dojo storm is when you take your Jujitsu guys and you go to another, and this happened it again in San Diego, San Diego. Where we live is, is it's gone through the phase already of all the schools being all, all, uh, uh, battling against each other and, and really the battle, there's multiple reasons.

Speaker 1:          00:48:26       One of them is because back in the day before youtube, you could actually have moves that you could keep contained in your school and you could say, hey look, don't show anyone this because we're going to use this in the next tournament and we want to, which is exactly what happened in Japan too, by the way. So what's the school with these schools? So you'd have secret moves will now, honestly with youtube and every competition is on youtube and you can watch anybody from any school and you can see what moves they're doing and there's all this online so, so basically there's no more secret school. Hey, you can knowledge anymore. The other thing is economically at one time it was don't leave my school cause you're my student. You're giving me 150 bucks a month and so don't go to another school. And what that did initially it worked.

Speaker 1:          00:49:09       You could keep your students, but people realize that if you want to get good, you have to get out and train with other people sometimes. And so if you weren't going to let me go and train it, other schools, sometimes I'm not going to train at your school. And so they would actually end up losing students by trying to keep the students. So I think that's it kind of leveled San Diego out and other areas that are high concentration jujitsu because yeah, it's because now it's, you know, people will come and go and train at different schools and everyone's cool and it's, it's just a much more mellow atmosphere. And they'll last December in 2000 when I first moved to the bay area and it was training in Jujitsu and I walked into the school to take my first class and they had, it wasn't very well written from a legal standpoint, but they hadn't NDA a nondisclosure agreement that they had people sign so that they would not teach the, the inner workings and techniques of Said School.

Speaker 1:          00:49:58       Yeah, exactly. Has it used to be a lot tighter and I think youtube pretty much is the thing that destroyed that. Uh, but, but back in the day, the Dojo storms would take place, which was we would go from one school and go to another school that was, let's say a school is saying, oh, we'll beat these guys. Are we have better Jujitsu? Oh really? You got Better Jiu Jitsu? Cool. Hello. How are you doing? We're here to see who did. Jujitsu is better and it's a Dojo storm and show up and, and you, you know, everything is determined on the mat. That's a beautiful thing about, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       so this is old school, a Dojo storming and this is against Jose [inaudible]. Jose [inaudible]. I'd have to see you. How's it spelled? H. O. Z. O. I. N? Yup. That's right here we go for a Dojo storm and he's, he's, he's showing up. They're kind of looking for where the school is. He's kind of like a little bit lost looking around for where the actual school is and there's a priest that he's working with. When he reappeared, the priest handed him a registry and inkbox box saying, write down your name and where you studied and what style you use. He spoke as though instructing a child. The title on the registry was list of persons visiting this temple to study steward of the holy zone. Musashi opened the book and glanced over the names each listed to under the date on which the Samurai or student had called following the style of the last entry.

Speaker 3:          00:51:24       He wrote down the required information omitting the name of his teacher. The priest, of course, was especially interested in that Musashi. His answer was essentially the one he'd given at the Yoshiko school. He had practiced the use of the truncheon under his father without working very hard at it. Since making up in his mind to study an earnest he had taken has his teacher everything in the universe as well as the example set by his predecessors throughout the country. He ended up by saying, I'm still in the process of learning learning. Hmm. You probably know this already, but since the time of our first master, the Joseon has been celebrated everywhere for it's lance techniques. The fighting that goes on here is a rough and there are no exceptions. Before you go on, perhaps you better read what's written at the beginning of the registry.

Speaker 3:          00:52:13       Musashi picked up the book, opened it and read the stipulation, which he had skipped over before. It said, having come here for the purpose of study, I absolve the temple of all responsibility in the event that I suffer bodily injury or I'm killed. I agree to that said Musashi with a slight grin. It amounted to no more than common sense for anyone committed to becoming a warrior. All right. This way. So that's the introduction and that's actually cool too. That's an old school Jujitsu thing when you'd come in for the, the other thing that would happen is challenge matches. And I don't know if you've seen videos from the old school Gracie Academy at the challenge matches, but those guys would come in and sign a waiver like, Hey, if you die, we're not really, we're not liable. So the uh, the old, uh, the gray market, black market copy over copy, VHS of Gracie in action. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We had my, my old teacher, Fabio Santos, and he had videos of himself doing Gracie challenge matches at the Gracie school up in Torrance and he would play him for us. And it's the same thing. Yup. Sign your waiver and then you're going to get your arm broken. By the way. First I put Aql Lik Deanna [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          00:53:25       So if this point he goes into the school and there's some bad ass, he's not the head of the school, but he's like their best guy and he's up there kicking everyone's ass. You say next and he's roughs the guy up and kicks his ass. Then next roughs that guy up next and finally no one else wants to fight him and here we go. This guy's name is og. I gone a g o. N. O Gorman. Yeah, I'd gone with an unusual, he's the guy that's been rough and everyone up, is it? Or is there no one else build are gone now holding his practice. Lance horizontally. The brawny steward was comparing his registry with the faces of the weighting men. He poured at one? No, not today. I'll come again some other time. How about, you know, I don't feel quite up to it today. One by one, they backed out until Musashi Musashi saw the finger pointing at him. How about you? If you please, if you please. What's that supposed to mean? It means I'd like to fight.

Speaker 3:          00:54:26       Um, yeah. And so he, he's going to go, and I'm going to pull a couple highlights out of this thing, but, but, but the, this guy, if you, if you please. So this guy had gone, he, he immediately does like a practice run at some board that he puts his lance right through. And it's sort of like an intimidation tactic, righty. Oh, you want to train? Cool. Watch this. He screams and he puts his lance right through this, this, uh, right through this thing. And it's actually, there's a, there's a, the old guy that had brought him into that, it broadened me, saw she's looking at him and saying, Hey, don't be a fool. You look stupid. That's not a board you're about to take on. Meaning like, you just killed the board, the piece of wood. But that's, this guy is not just a board.

Speaker 3:          00:55:16       Um, but it's don't hit back. Yeah. And, and, and paper targets don't shoot back and they don't move. That's something I've said many, many times. Um, Musashi then says after he does this, you know, like this crazy scream and puts his glance through the wood. He says, are you ready? Now back to the book. This solicit to you drove a gone wild. His muscles were like steel when he jumped. He did so with awesome lightness. His feet seem to be on the floor and in the air at the same time quivering like the moonlight on ocean waves. Musashi stood perfectly still or so it seemed there was nothing unusual about his stance. He held his sword straight out with both hands, but being slightly smaller than his opponent and not so conspicuously muscular. He looked almost casual. The greatest difference was in their eyes, Musashi's were sharp as a bird. Their pupils, a co clear coral tinted with blood at gone shook his head perhaps to shake off the streams of sweat pouring down from his forehead, perhaps to shake off the old man's a warning wards. Had they lingered on, was he attempting to cast him out of his mind? Whatever the reason, he was extremely agitated. He repeatedly shifted his position trying to draw out Musashi. But Musashi remained motionless at God's lunch was accompanied by a piercing scream in the split second that decided the encounter Musashi parried to encounter attacked.

Speaker 4:          00:56:43       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:56:43       What happened at God's fellow priest hastily ran over and crowded around him in a black circle in the general confusion. Some tripped over his practice and, and went sprawling. A pre stood up his hands and chest smeared with blood shouting medicine, bring the medicine quick. You won't need any medicine. It was the old man who had come in the front entrance and quint quickly assessed the situation. His face turns sour. If I thought medicine would save him, I wouldn't have tried to stop him in the first place.

Speaker 3:          00:57:18       So that's it. Musashi one shot, one kill takes the dude out. And um, interestingly, here's the advice. So that guy that had taken him in is the actual master and he says, uh, is your name Miyamoto Musashi? That's correct. Under whom did you study the martial arts? I've had no teacher in the ordinary sense. My father taught me how to use the challenge in when I was young. Since then, I've picked up a number of points from the older SAML and Sam Rhine, various provinces. I've also spent some time traveling about the countryside, learning from the mountains and the rivers. I regard them too as teachers. You seem to have the right attitude, but you're so strong, much too strong, believing he was being praised, Musashi blushed and said, oh no, I'm still immature. I'm always making blunders. That is not what I mean. Your strength is your problem. You must learn to control it, become weaker,

Speaker 2:          00:58:12       which also fun to do. And I'm thinking about doing this, uh, when I reread this book in full again, is to spend some time on youtube watching yeah. A high level Kendall competition

Speaker 3:          00:58:28       to see how fast it is. Yeah. Just to get an idea of the, how much can transpire in the blink of an eye. Is there a referee that calls it as a kill shot? How does it, how does it get scored?

Speaker 2:          00:58:42       There are referees. So I had a chance to, uh, to train in Kendo when I went back to Japan about eight years ago, something like that, eight or 10 years ago. And I trained at this place called the Qa Kang and I still have the armor still have everything. And you, you have too much like calling your shots and pool. You have to call your target a split second before you hit it or as you hit it and see what's it like men, his head, uh, Dole, his abdomen, Colt is the gauntlet or the arm. And then [inaudible] is a jab to the throat, which is pretty nasty. Uh, and you line up in such a way the sword is, the tip of the sword is basically pointing at your opponents throat as you track them. And you can see, but there are referees in cases of any type of, they're definitely referees in cases of any dispute.

Speaker 2:          00:59:34       They're very rarely disputes, but it's so subtle and the, the, the misses are so close, much like really maybe high, really, really high level boxing. I mean when someone Perry's, it's not like it's traveling a foot to the side of their head, it's just grazing the side of their head and then they counter punch. Then you see it in Kendo, the movements just faster. So it's really wild to see, get your bell rung when you get hit. I expected because I saw the armor, the armor seems pretty hard that you don't, you absolutely get your Bell Rung. Especially I remember my first class and you know, I'm bigger than a lot of Japanese guys. Not all. I mean there's certainly some big Japanese guys, uh, and I was more heavily muscled and they're like, oh, okay. And there's, and most of the, Jeff, this has been my experience in Japanese schools, whether it's judo, Jujitsu, Ken know, otherwise spend some time way back in the day with the pancreas guys and so on before.

Speaker 2:          01:00:32       And then they really came to the u s is generally speaking, everyone's pretty cool. I suppose this is true in the u s two then there just one or two guys were like, oh, foreigner in my school. Okay, I want to ring your bell. And, uh, there was one guy there who wanted to, wanted to fight and I was like, okay, because I figured like my reflexes are pretty good. But the reflexes of head movement in Kendo, bad idea, you always want to have the sword in between, uh, you and your opponent and to protect the center line. So if you start moving your head or your shoulders in such a way that you might say of Aveda Punch, you really expose yourself. So I ended up getting a whacked, not just on the top of the head but behind the armor because your back is open in the back of your head is open.

Speaker 2:          01:01:20       And so I ended up getting whacked like on the upper traps and neck with these Shinai, these bamboo swords, which hurt I, those, those absolutely will ring your bell. So yeah, you feel it. You're familiar with the dog brothers, right? Yeah. Those, they bring it, they really bring it, they're awesome. I have nothing but respect for the dog. But if you don't know what they are, you can check them out on youtube. But they do full contact, simulated knife and stick. And I think it started with stick fighting started with stick. Yeah. Start with a screamer. And my understanding is they have the gathering. I haven't see, I was watching these videos at the same time as watching the Gracie in action videos. And I remember like, oh, people were just learning what a triangle choke was. It's like, Ooh, I can show people in my legs.

Speaker 2:          01:02:03       I was a new thing. And I remember thinking this video of, I think it was the gathering where you have salty dog and so on. And the participants who come just have to mutually agree on which weapons are acceptable. See definitely one guy with a garden hose. And then another guy was like, I Kendo sword with like the tip cut offs. It's splayed open. And then they would go at it. And I remember this one point I saw this guy pull guard. You know the people are just going nuts. Some people have lacrosse helmets on. I mean it's like, it's just bonkers, Mad Max. And these two guys are going at it and uh, one's clearly a wrestler. He takes the guy down and gets caught in a triangle and I'm like, oh, I guess that's it. I was like, no, that's not it. And the guy took his, his escrima stick and took the end of it and just shoved it right in between the guy's ass cheeks. Great Way to break the triangle. It turns out. And then just getting, then just proceeded to beat the living shit out of him with a stick on the ground. That's not fun. I don't like that. Trying to offense at all.

Speaker 3:          01:03:05       Don't like that at all. Um, I think we're getting into another just good. He's, he's about to meet up with these more, more of these hustling guys for some battle. All the priests carried Lance's blacks leaves, talked up, they were ready for action, apparently set upon avenging the death of a gone and restoring the temples honor. They looked grotesque like so many demons from hell. The Ronin formed a semicircle so they could watch the show and at the same time keep Musashi from escaping. This precaution, however, proved unnecessary from Musashi, showed no signs of either running or backing down. In fact, he was walking steadily and directly toward them. Slowly pace by pace. He advanced looking as if he might pounce it any moment. For a moment there was an ominous silence as both sides contemplated approaching death. Musashi's fleece face went deadly white and through his eyes stared the eyes of the god of vengeance glittering with venom. He was selecting his prey,

Speaker 4:          01:04:17       okay?

Speaker 3:          01:04:17       Neither the Ronin nor the priest wears tents is Musashi. Their numbers gave them confidence and their optimism was unshakeable. Still no one wanted it to be attacked, wanted to be the first attacked a priest at the end of the column of the Lancers gave a signal, and without breaking formation, they rust around to Musashi's. Right Musashi, I am in. Shawn shouted, the same priest. I'm told you came while I was away away and killed a gone that you later publicly insulted the honor of the ozone that you mocked us by having posters put up all over town. Is this true? No. Shouted Musashi. If you're a priest, you should know better than to trust only what you see in here. You should consider things with your mind and spirit. It was like pointing, pouring oil on the flames, ignoring their leader. The priest began to shout, saying, talk was cheap.

Speaker 3:          01:05:06       It was time to fight. They were enthusiastically seconded by the and who had grouped themselves in close formation and we saw she's left screaming, cursing, and waving their swords in the air. They Egged the priests on into action. Musashi convinced that the road and we're all mouth and no fight, suddenly turned to them and shouted, all right, which one of you wants to come forward? All but two or three fell back a plate. Taste each sure that we saw she's evil. I was upon him to the two or three brave ones stood ready, swords out, stretched in issuing a challenge in the wink of an eye. Musashi was on on one of them like a fighting cock. There was a sound of a popping cork and the ground turned red. Then came a chilling noise. Not a battle cry, not a curse, but it truly bud blood curdling howl, Musashi sword, screeched back and forth through the air. A reverberation in its own body. In his own body telling him when he connected with human bone, blood and brains spattered from his blade fingers and arms flew through the air

Speaker 3:          01:06:11       most of the time. Musashi wasn't really conscious of what he was doing. He was in a sort of trance, a murderous dream in which body and soul were concentrated in this three foot sword unconsciously. His whole life experience, the knowledge his father had beaten into him. What he had learned at the sec of Jara, the theories he had heard at the various schools of swordsmanship, the lessons taught to him by the mountains and trees. Everything came into play in the rapid movements of his body. He became a disembodied whirlwind mowing down the heard of Ronan who buy their stunned bewilderment, left themselves wide open to his sword.

Speaker 3:          01:06:52       I'm trying to think of why these particular passages, but one of the things know this disembodiment which I talk about all the time. Being able to be detached from what's happening is so important as a person, as a leader and as a, you know in martial arts you have to do it too. If you're getting so wrapped up around the fought of what's happening you, you won't make good decisions. But this actually goes beyond it. This, this is like getting in the zone. This is, you know, when you're not thinking anymore, and I always say in Jujitsu, if you're, if you're thinking about your next move, it's too late. That person's already doing something to you. But that idea of being disembodied and being detached and not thinking about what you're doing but just doing it is, is epic if you can do it.

Speaker 2:          01:07:33       And, uh, we were, we were chatting a little bit, uh, Echo, you and I before we started recording about Marcello Garcia in New York. And I've spent some time with Martin Marcello and rolled with Marcello and I'm not by any stretch, I would say good at Jujitsu, but nonetheless had a chance to spend some time on the mat with him and a handful of other guys, sweetest guy you could ever imagine. For people who don't know the name, I suppose it's fair to say that Michael Jordan, Mike Tyson, Wayne Gretzky of Jujitsu wrapped into one. He's, he's just, uh, kind of like the, the Kimura after which the camera is named. So who was a very famous judoka and also really good at Jujitsu, fought Helio Gracie people in Japan used to say before Kimora know Kimora after crew after Kimora, no, Q Moreau, like a nonrecurring phenomenon and uh, Marcello's I mean gotta be close to that.

Speaker 2:          01:08:29       I mean he's, he's really good. And one of the things that you observe with Marcello and Josh Waitzkin who cones the school with him was very close friend of mine and also considered a chess prodigy. He was the basis for searching for Bobby Fischer. He says that, you know, Marcel was a nickname is the, I think the king of the scramble, but he doesn't view it as a scramble. Uh, and what, uh, what Josh was telling me is that Marcello can basically see a move in and movement in general in more frames per second. So we're, most people see position a transition that is kind of undefined to position B. He sees 30 positions in between a and B. And you see that when a, if you, if you want to really see some wild stuff, you can check out just to look up the Marcello teen, which is his brand of guilty in which is really, uh, it's, it's so technical for something that can be so sloppy when people don't know what they are.

Speaker 2:          01:09:28       It's so tactical and he can catch people in a guillotine from any conceivable position that most people wouldn't even consider a position. I've seen him, I seen him catch people and Guillotine people who weigh like 300 pounds and not fat, 300 like big, big, big people. And then they try to come around his legs into saying north south position and he gets them to tap when they appeared to have him in a north south position. Um, but he seems to be able to access this same type of mind state at will. Yeah. I mean obviously it has to do with these training all the time. I mean all the time and yeah, all the time. And he just has turns his mind off of it and his body's working without them. I bet you, I bet you if you hooked up like brain scan and you see what he's thinking about, he's probably thinking about like chicken for dinner or whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:10:21       You know what I mean? Like these thoughts are just not there. But that's how I feel when I have good, when I could do good Jujitsu, I come off the mat and I don't, someone will say, Hey, what was that move you did on me? I'm like, I have no idea what I just did, you know? I just have no idea. I don't know what happened. And, and sometimes if you're thinking about something, you might remember bits and pieces, but that's what he's talking about. And that section is like, hey, it's not even, you're not even there. It's, it's all the trainings there, the things you've been instructed, the practice that you've done, that's what's there and that's what's executing the movements. Yeah. It's a beautiful place to be. Whenever people talk asking me about meditation, like do you meditate? Jocko Mcgee do Jujitsu, you know? Oh, I agree with that. Yeah. I think of the brain. Yeah. I mean it's, it's just present state awareness and not endlessly thinking about whatever it is that might occupy and distract you. Otherwise it gives you that.

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       Actually somebody asked me that the other day and I was doing an event. The guy says, you know, how do you, how do you recharge your batteries? Like it just seems like you're going hard all the time. How do you recharge your batteries? And my initial, I, I actually responded. I said, look, I don't, to be honest with you, I don't really recharge. I'm going, I'm just going and there's this. And then as I thought about it, I said, actually, no, I'm wrong. I recharge all the time. I'm solar powered, solar powered. I moved myself to get energized, right? And look the windup watch or whatever. But no, the reality is is I recharge myself, um, through physical activity. That's where I recharge myself is by surfing in Jujitsu and working out. That's the recharge.

Speaker 2:          01:11:54       So just to build on that, because I think it's really important people think of recharging as, as physical rest, but a lot, if anyone has really gone through a very, very stressful period in their lives, whether that's the death of a loved one or a breakup, anything that you obsessive Lee, think about you can not move for most of the day and feel like you've run five marathons. So by getting out of your head and into your body saying Jujitsu or surfing, you're taking a break from these leaders that we can replay that are what? Drain the battery. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:12:34       Yeah. I think it's, I, you know, again, uh, luckily the guy asked me that question and I realized as I was answering it, you know, first I sounded like an arrogant jerk. I was that guy. Although he's on auto need no recharge. No, that's not true. Actually. If I go days without training or without working out, I start to feel like crap and I, and how do I recharge? I get home and I'm like, oh, there's my squat rack and or there's the mat and you can get on it and train. So yeah, that's

Speaker 2:          01:12:58       totally true. Totally true. One quick story of that Marcello, which also makes me, you can tell Marcel was 20 for the rest thing. Think about Musashi is a, he's famous for being hard to find when he gets called to the mat when it's his turn to compete even at a world championship level. And he is almost always found because Josh has had to track him down a few times asleep like in between the bleachers and Vic Marcella Marcella, you're up and be like, oh, okay, cool. And he'll like get up and stretch and literally walk 50 feet, like seven seconds later on to the mat for the finals and the world championships and just turn it on and then destroy people.

Speaker 3:          01:13:43       And that's cool too. And I, I don't know if I hit it in the book, but that's one of Musashi's things is Musashi would show up late, he'd have duals and he'd show up hour late, 15 minutes late, 20 minutes late and have that person getting all frustrated.

Speaker 2:          01:13:56       Yeah, no, it's, I mean it's, I was thinking about this because I, I was, uh, I remember this about Musashi and I was trying to think of how to explain in a culture like in that period what's showing up an hour late might equate to in the US it would be like coming over to meet someone at their house, shaking their hand, sitting down at the dinner table than like getting up on the dinner table and taking a shit right on there. It's like, and then asking them to clean it up cause it smells bad. Like it would be, it would be that rude. So of course, and it also made me think of this book, I think it's called winning ugly. It's about tennis, but it relates to this form of psychological warfare and like taking too much time, like in between serves and making your opponent unnerved so that even if they're technically superior, you can end up beating them. And Soon Musashi, it's the simplest trick in the book, but he would show up late, late and these people would lose their minds. And uh, and then if they're like, oh, this guy always shows up late. And then he'd show up three hours early and scout the whole place out and then kill everybody.

Speaker 3:          01:15:13       Good. Um, this was an interesting piece. Here's another weapon and he's working with this guy who designs weapons and it's called the chain ball sickle. So it's like the sickle and then a chain and then a ball. But again, this is reminds me of Kung Fu movies when I was a kid, but he's seen this and hear this guy's name is bacon be a I. K. E. N biking. Biking. Did you just chime in over there at Aqua Charles? Yeah. Why is that? Cause I know, but not on letting you guys do anything. That's good. Good. Just be Japanese or something that you've been holding out on me a little bit. Yeah, I do like the idea of calling him bacon though. I might not have another kid. I might even baking in Hawaii. The pronunciation is very similar. Biking, biking, biking, insisted. You said you wanted to hear more about the chain ball sickle.

Speaker 3:          01:16:08       I'll tell you everything I know, but let's have a few drinks while we're talking. When he will return with a Saki bike and poured some into a heating jar, put it on the fire and talk to great length about the chain ball sickle and ways to use it to advantage in actual combat. The best thing about it he told saw she was that unlike a sort of gave the enemy no time to defend himself. Also before attacking the enemy directly, it was possible to snatch his weapon away from him with the chain. A skillful throw up the chain, a sharp Yank and the enemy had no sword. Still seated. Bacon, Dem biking demonstrated a stance. You see you hold the sickle in your left hand and the ball and you're right. If the enemy comes at you, take him with, take him on with the blade, then hurl the ball at his face.

Speaker 3:          01:16:55       That's one way. Changing positions he went on. Now in this case, when there's some space between you and the enemy, you take his weapon away with the chain. It doesn't make any difference what kind of weapon it is. A sword. Lance wouldn't staff or whatever bike and went on and on telling Musashi about the ways of throwing the ball about the 10 or more oral traditions concerning the weapon about how the chain was like a snake about how it was possible by cleverly alternating movements of the chain and sickle to create optical illusions and caused the enemy's defense to work to his own detriment about all the secret ways of using the weapon. Musashi was fascinated when he heard talk like this. He listened with his whole body eager to absorb every detail, the chain, the sickle two hands. As he listened, the seeds of other thoughts formed in his mind. The sword can be used with one hand, but a man has two hands and that's where he gets this idea of uh, for using two sorts when he fights. And I'm sure you know more about that.

Speaker 2:          01:17:59       So yeah, so he originated as style that has many different names. Uh, I think, uh, there, there are a few different of it. I'm probably going to get this incorrect, but there's like Nita Nietzsche I think is one way to say it, uh, but the, the form of having one long sword and then the equivalent of say, I would imagine in the military of of uh, like a side arm, uh, like a pistol. So you have your primary and then you would have your, whatever it might be, you know, a Glock 19 or whatever. And Typically Samurai would use their primary and then failing that if it broke or if it would, if they were disarmed, then they would use their shorter sword. And he would in some cases utilize both simultaneously, which was very, very highly, highly unusual and requires a completely different method of fighting because the grip on the sword is very, very particular.

Speaker 2:          01:19:01       When you look at say at Kendo Sword and how it's positioned. Uh, if you, uh, if you have then two swords, it requires a completely different repertoire of technique. And I don't know, I don't recall offhand if they get into it in this book, but we saw she was also an expert in, in weaponry throwing. So there were instances, and I would have loved to have seen this and I'm sure there's a video on youtube of someone trying this, but he would routinely throw his shorter sword and also later on because he was in a, I don't want to skip too far ahead, but he would also instruct in the use of shooken, which are the throwing stars. So he was an expert at throwing weapons as well as wielding the sword. Uh, and uh, it's, it's a completely different school of training that some people still use.

Speaker 2:          01:19:56       And Kendo at the highest levels. I haven't seen it very much because I think there aren't as many teachers. Is that legal? It is legal as far as I can tell. Yeah. There were people who I've seen demonstrated and you can find some video, not much, but a little bit of video of using one short and one long. Uh, and it's, it's, they're not a degree of difference. They're different species all together. Yeah. That's weird. Sometimes when I'm rolling Jujitsu and you get sweaty enough and slippery enough and it's, it's a, it's a little bit of a different sport. Oh totally. Like it's like you are not going to be able to do this to me right now because I'm just too slippery. And, and same with g and Nogi and it's weird, you know, of course I always tell people like GE and Nogi they're different but they're the same and, and then it goes one degree further.

Speaker 2:          01:20:46       Cause when you get just super slippery Nogi it's, it's about the difference between ghee and Nogi. Maybe not quite as much, but another Marcello story. Yeah. Can't resist. So I trained with Dave Camp Maria for a period of time. Who is one of my favorite human beings and just a sweetheart of a guy and a hell of a competitor and also high level judo. Yeah. And so when he competed in Jujitsu, most people were terrified of his standup and they would kick their hips back and then he would do a flying arm bar and routinely used flying armbars on. Everyone here uses a total beast to just, I was on the competition circuit around the same time as him and some of the other guys we were talking about earlier and they, yeah, they were killers. So Dave went to New York and trained with Marcel for a period of time.

Speaker 2:          01:21:31       And to me, I mean, Dave, he's a high level competitor. Like I've, I've never seen Dave thrown around or anything like that. And so he's telling me about his experience and he's friends with Marcel, but the experience of, of rolling Nogi and I was like, oh, well that makes, I suppose that makes sense. I've heard so much about Marcello, but once you put on the gear was different game, I assume because of all your experience that you had. And he's like, no, it was even worse. Yeah. I find that with Dean, my buddy dean, who is, you know, world champion multiple times with no [inaudible] and everyone thinks, oh, well if you put the key on, maybe you can neutralize them and stuff. No, it's worse because you can't move at all and he doesn't. And it's not like he doesn't know Jujitsu with g, he's savage is there.

Speaker 2:          01:22:16       Someone's really good. It gives them more control. They already have control over you. Now they have even more control and now they have handles. It's not fun. Uh, do you got one you want to read? You know? Yeah. I want to just, these are, these are things that I highlighted when I was really just coming into the professional world and felt like I needed to toughen myself on a number of different levels. And this is one that I highlighted. This is from fairly early in the book, which means it's like the end of a normal book early in the book and it's talking about a period of his traveling and he says, or I should say it reads, he stopped along the way to look at several well known temples. And at each of them he bowed and said two prayers. One was, please protect my sister from harm. The other was, please test the lowly Musashi with hardship. Let him become the greatest swordsmen in the land or let him die. Please test the lowly Musashi with hardship. That's what he's praying for.

Speaker 1:          01:23:23       And that's what you'd think when you were getting into the professional world. You're like, all right, bring it because you were scared. You think you were scared about what was gonna happen.

Speaker 2:          01:23:31       I knew that I had relatively high pain tolerance and uh, I could handle a lot of workload. So I was, I was preparing myself for several years of being lowest on the totem pole and suffering. Got It. But making up for our lack of experience by just absorbing more punishment in the form of just working longer hours, work hard, doing more, always doing more. And uh, served me well at the time. Got An idea for a book anyways, I guess. Yeah, exactly. And then when I disintegrated in self imploded, I had an idea for a book. Uh, yeah, there's a go. This is another one. And uh, it's referring to I believe Musashi's writing and it says, well, his writing has a certain childish quality, but there's an appealing, what can I say directness about it. If I had a swordsman in mind, I would say it shows spiritual breadth. The boy may eventually be somebody. I just liked that. The childish directness. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:24:41       Yeah. The good stuff. And again, that's, that's what you were thinking about yourself. Like, Hey, at that time you were the young swordsman coming up in the business world. That's right. Having to make things happen. Um, there's a, there's another fight scene here. He called him fight scenes cause I don't know, that sounds like a movie, a Kung Fu movie. Not that there's anything wrong with Kung Fu movies cause some Kung Fu movies are awesome, but some of them are also cheesy. Sure. Um, the, you're a movie professional there. Echo Charles. Yeah. I don't think he'd be called the scene if it's in a book. Okay. I Dunno. I Dunno. Is it not a scene if it's in a book? It could be, we could do this. It reads like a screenplay. So if it were a screenplay, we could call it a beat or a scene. I think. Here's a, here's a scene after an inner, this is a fight with a guy named Dan Chin. Shiro. After an interval of two or three breaths, Denson Chiro shouted Musashi. He was well aware that the man standing several feet above him was in a very advantageous position. Not only was he perfectly safe from the rear, but anyone trying to attack him either from the right or left would first have to climb up to his level. He was thus free to devote his entire attention to the enemy before him. So he's about to fight this guy. And as you said earlier, sometimes he

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       shows up late. Sometimes he shows up early. In this case, he showed up early and he got an elevated position, and so his enemy, Daesh, Charo is sitting there looking, going, oh, this sucks. I'm below him. And he's protected from the back and left and right, and then Musashi says, are you ready? Musashi's question was calm, but trenchant falling like so much ice water on his opponents. Feverish excitement. Denson Searo. Now God has first good look at Musashi. So this is the bastard he thought his hatred was total. He resented the maiming of his brother. He was vexed at being compared with Masashi by the common people and he had an ingrained contempt for what he regarded as a country upstart posing as a Samurai. Who are you to ask? Are you ready? It is well past the hour of nine did I say I'd be here exactly at nine don't make excuses.

Speaker 3:          01:26:58       I've been waiting a long time. As you can see, I'm fully prepared now come down from there. He did not underestimate his opponent in the extent of daring attack, daring to attack from his present position in a minute, answered Musashi with a slight laugh. There was a difference between Musashi's idea of preparation and his opponents. Denson Shiro though physically prepared had only begun to pull himself together spiritually, whereas Musashi had started fighting long before he presented himself to his enemy. For him, the battle was now entering its second and central phase. At the Geelong Shrine. He had seen the footprints in the snow and at that moment is fighting. Instinct had been aroused knowing that the shadow of the man following him was no longer there. He had boldly entered the gate and made a quick approach to the kitchen. Having waken the priest, he struck up a conversation suddenly questioning the man as to what had been going on earlier in the evening edition sharp, disregarding the fact that he was a little late.

Speaker 3:          01:28:04       He had, he had had some tea and warmed himself up. Then when he made his appearance it was abrupt and from relative safety of the Veranda he had seized the initiative. So I guess I was wrong in this section. He doesn't show up late but he or he shows up late but he like gets to an advantageous position without the other guy realizing it, which is just as cool. Did you find one? I've got so many but this one, this one. This one is good because it highlights how profound is maybe too strong a word but a deep, some of the characters in the book are besides Musashi, because there are quite a few characters in here and this is a teacher. This is an exchange between is as far as I can tell, he's Imo and who's one of the teachers or a PR prospective teacher and Musashi and Musashi

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       has brought a letter that he wants. He's, I'm wonder read, which is some type of request for instruction and cause I'm on is ignoring both Musashi and the letter and he says, but just please read the letter. I don't want to just please read the letter. No, I'm not going to read your letter. And then it says, please read the letter. I don't need to. And then massage. She says, what's the matter? Can't you read cause I'm an snorted. And then massage. She says, well, if you can read, read it. This is what he says. You're a tricky brat. The reason I said I don't need to read it is that I already know what it says. Musashi says even so, wouldn't it be more polite to read it? And this is how the teacher responds. Student warriors swarm here like mosquitoes and maggots. If I took time to be polite to all of them, I wouldn't be able to do anything else. And that he continues. I feel sorry for you. However. So I'll tell you what the letter says. All right,

Speaker 3:          01:29:59       this piece right here, ah, it's just good. This is the continuation of that fight scene, which actually goes on for multiple pages.

Speaker 3:          01:30:08       His technique is better than mine. Musashi thought candidly, he had the same feeling of inferiority at Cole. You Guy who castle when he had been encircled by four leading swordsmen of the Yazoo school. It was always this way when he faced towards men of the north of the Orthodox schools for his own technique was without form or reason, nothing more really than a do or die method staring at dead Chinchero. He saw that the style Yoshi was you Kempo had created and spent his life, had both simply simplicity and complexity. Complexity was well ordered and systematic and was not to be overcome by brute strength or spirit alone. Musashi was cautious about making any unnecessary movements, has primitive tactics or refuse to come into play to an extent that surprised him. His arms rebelled against being extended. The best he could do is maintain a conservative defensive stance and wait. His eyes grew red searching for an opening. He prayed to hace man for victory and then they go through and it's just dead silence. Snow accumulated on Musashi, his hair, and then he kind of breaks him down mentally, um, destined charros feet inched forward at the tip of his sword. His willpower quivered toward the start of a movement to lives expired with two strokes of a single sword first. And we saw she attacked who his rear. So a guy had snuck up behind him, Musashi kills that guy and then kills it's just another, um, another great battle scene.

Speaker 2:          01:31:51       And the, uh, the eyes, they talk about the eyes quite a bit in this book. And I'll come back to Kendo where you, something that's very uncommon in Japanese culture, which is really intense. Direct eye contact doesn't happen a whole lot in Japanese culture. Even in the martial arts. In judo it's more of a relaxed gaze. And you might come out first and there's some yelling. So you'll hear that quite a bit. I don't know if non Japanese do it, but in Japan when I was watching certain people compete or competing myself and you'd hear people and they come out and after they bough they'll let out a bit of a scream. But then it's, then it's down to business. And in Kendo you hear a lot more vocalization and really intense eye contact. Are you trained to look at their eyes? Yeah. Okay. So would you, where do you look in wrestling?

Speaker 2:          01:32:43       In wrestling, and I should say, I mean I was, I was a decent high school restaurant, had a good competitive record, but, uh, I wouldn't consider myself anywhere like a d one restaurant, just mop the floor with me. Uh, but I would typically have kind of more of a soft, uh, I can hips type of, I mean I'm always looking at people's chest in every sport. I'm looking kind of like naval and chest, usually kind of watch it in the hips, in wrestling. But in Kempo they teach you to look at the eyes in Kendo. Kendo, they teach you to look at the eyes and are you looking for like, to see what they're going to do? That's where you're going to see their movement. You know, there isn't any explicit instruction and why, but you communicate a lot with your eyes and a, so you can tell if someone's intimidated.

Speaker 2:          01:33:28       You can tell if someone's angry, you can tell. Uh, you can also throw people off. So for instance, I mean you have Mendel Colt Day and all this stuff. You have the targets, right? And what I realized pretty quickly is that much like in say, boy ty on Thai kickboxing, one of the oldest tricks in the book, which is really, really unpleasant if you happen to get caught with it, is particularly since I ball up to say I got caught with it when I went to Japan because I want it to also cross train in striking. And so I went to a number of schools including place called [inaudible] and kindness is, it's at the end of it like Coldwell [inaudible], this, this con, whatever it is, that sort of place of practice, right? And, uh, first time I sparred someone in the, in the karate schools in Japan, like Gilchrist g and, and so on, they don't have head contact with the fists, but it's bare fisted.

Speaker 2:          01:34:24       So you're punching each other in the chest and body and so on. And this guy was wailing on my legs. He was just like hitting me with these, these, uh, roundhouse kicks to the legs and I had never even seen like kicks before. So I was punching him right in the chest, just below his collarbone, right his throat. And then punching him in the stomach and he was kicking me in the legs. I was like, hey bro, like I'll do this all day long. And so punching the Jasmine, I had to skip school the next day cause I couldn't walk. But the trick in Moy Tai that you see a lot is like, look at the leg low kick, look at the leg, low kick, look at the leg, low kick, look at the leg, low kick and still it until it really starts to hook hurt and then look at the leg head kick.

Speaker 2:          01:35:06       And you see a lot of people get knocked out that way. So when Ken know you can do something very similar where you're sort of telegraphing deliberately with your eyes and going for a certain target, you get parried you do that four or five times and then you telegraph the same way and go for a different target. Yeah. Uh, but yeah, the eye contact is, was, it's really, it's really intense. And if you watch, Kendall won't say youtube and imagine what the eye contact is like. If their eyes are like wide open staring at each other, it adds another layer of flavor to the entire experience. And then you can read a passage like this and you're like, Oh God, I can see it. And it's opposite of Jujitsu where you don't really look at the person. Yeah. It's almost like the little unwritten rule. Like don't know why contract. Yeah. Those gazing lovingly into someone's eyes like purposefully when I'm trying to really mess with someone, you know, I just look right at him like and shake my head very suddenly.

Speaker 2:          01:36:11       And you probably noticed that they never really look at you unless you do it super deliberately. Like if you try to roll with someone when you were with someone, try like notice where they're looking. It's almost like they're just blank. The blank. Yeah. Just, I mean that's a weird thing too is with Jujitsu you don't even have to use your eyes. Like I used to notice, I don't notice it so much anymore. I used to notice if someone was in a good position on me, I would actually close my eyes. I started viewing it like I was not, it was, it wasn't smart like I was doing it to relax myself. Someone gets in a good position. I just close my eyes cause you, you know where they are. They're freaking, you know, on your back or they're across the side, you know exactly where they are.

Speaker 2:          01:36:48       But I would just close my eyes to kind of relax. I don't do it anymore cause it seems like a bad idea. Right. Why would you close your eyes? Stupid. It burns a lot of energy though. I remember doing training with Laird Hamilton who's one of the most famous big wave surfers of all time. If anyone hasn't seen the documentary riding giants. Oh my God. Yeah. Go see that. The invention of tow in surfing, holy God. And he leered is a beast. I mean he's one of the most incredible physical specimens I've ever seen. He's in his fifties and just wipes the floor with like first round draft picks routinely, uh, in terms of workouts. And he likes to do a lot of underwater training with weights. And he's devised all of these original exercises, like there's one called ammo boxes where you hold a Dumbbell, he holds a 50 pound dumbbell to his chest and then swims across the surface of the pool or just slightly submerged with one arm.

Speaker 2:          01:37:45       Uh, and then does all manner of different exercises. And his wife, Gabby, Gabby Reece, who is also a world class athlete of her own right, said to me, relax your eyes because under water, when I'm holding like two 50 pound dumbbells, understandably, my eyes are bugging out of my head and she's like, you're burning too much energy. She's like, try relaxing your eyes and I could hold my breath for another 10, 15 seconds just by relaxing my eyes. Uh, and just, just another side note that's related and I think relates to a lot in this book also, not just Jujitsu is in, uh, in tango. I'm making it a point to bring up tango every time we talk publicly about cool, let's be the best female dancers very frequently close their eyes because if they try to read the males movement in order to respond, it's already too late. If they tried to do it visually, it's too late. And I think that with a lot of martial arts, certainly that in particular with grappling, I mean your body is always going to sense it before your eyes can interpret it. And that's why I was doing it originally. Yeah. Much like the female tangle.

Speaker 2:          01:38:58       I remember Greg had a drill where you'd start back to back and said, okay, you've got to close your eyes. Just kind of trust you gotta close your eyes and then grapple. And I remember doing it and think, oh, that's not that much harder. It's like as long as you're already connected with the guy, it's not that much harder.

Speaker 3:          01:39:12       Yeah. So speaking of tango dancing and women, here's, uh, he, he again, Ohsu is in and out of the book and at this point he is heading to a battle and the odds are against him. And Ot wants to go in with him and she actually wants to die if he dies, and so he's having a conversation with her and here we go. Don't be a fool oh two he suddenly blurted. There's no reason why you should die. The strength in his own voice and the depth of his feeling surprised to even him. He's one thing from you to die fighting against the Yoshi. This not only is it right for a man who lives by the sword, die by the sword. I have a duty to remind those cowards of the way of the Samurai your willingness to follow me to death as deeply touching, but what good would it do?

Speaker 3:          01:40:05       No more than the pitiful death of an insect. Seeing her burst into tears, he regretted the brutality of his words. Now I understand how over the years I've lied to you and I've lied to myself. I didn't intend to deceive you when we ran away from the bridge, from the village or when I saw you at Hunada bridge, but I did by pretending to be cold and indifferent. That wasn't the way I really felt. In a little while, I'll be dead. What I'm trying, what I'm about to say is the truth. I love you. Oh Tzu. I throw everything to the four winds and live out my life with you. If only after a moment's pause, he continued in a more forceful vein. You must believe every word I say because I'll never have another chance to you. This I speak with neither pride nor pretense.

Speaker 3:          01:40:57       There have been days when I couldn't concentrate for thinking about you nights. I couldn't sleep for dreaming of you. Hot, passionate dreams, Otu dreams that nearly drove me mad often have hugged my palate, pretending it was you. But even when I felt like that, if I took out my sword and looked at it, the madness evaporated and my blood cooled. Her face turned toward him. Tearful boat as radiant as the morning glory. She started to speak, seeing the fervor in his eyes, her words caught in her throat and she looked again at the ground. The sword is my refuge. Anytime my passion threatens to overcome me, I forced myself back into the world of swordsman ship. This is my fate. Ohsu. I'm torn between love and self discipline. I seem to be traveling on two paths at once. Yet when the past diverge, I invariably managed to keep myself on the right one.

Speaker 3:          01:41:55       I know myself better than anyone does. I'm neither a genius nor great man. He became silent again despite his desires to express his feelings. Honestly, his word seem to be concealing the truth. His heart told him to be even more candid. That's the kind of man I am. What else can I say? I think of my sword and you disappear into some dark corner of my mind. No disappear altogether. Leaving no trace at times like that. I'm happiest and most satisfied with my life. Do you understand all this time you've suffered, you've risked your body and soul and a man who loves his sword more than he loves you. I'll die to vindicate my sword, but I wouldn't die for the love of a woman. Not even you as so much as I'd like to fall on my knees and begged forgiveness. I can't.

Speaker 1:          01:42:55       Yeah. Another speech. You another scene that most women would rather not go through. Yeah. And it's another, I, again, I know I don't relate to every normal person at all in very little ways, but like when I read that, I'm always like, yeah, that's what I'm talking about. And I've been married for 20 years to an awesome woman. And uh, but yeah, when I hear that, I just think, yeah, that's how you do it, right? Hey, look, every time I would start thinking about you, I just look at my rifle and be good. I want us, I want to, I want to chime in and get something, another one that is not chronologically, yeah, sorry. We're out. We're out of sync. Oh, it's okay. But the ones that I underline tend to be universally, I think universally applicable in some ways. Yeah. So to the four, this is a apparently a discussion about some type of battle and they're going back and forth. Uh,

Speaker 2:          01:43:54       all right, so this is Musashi then. What else can I do? But challenge him? I realize of course that even if I do, he'll probably refuse to come out of retirement. So I'm challenging this whole castle to a battle instead. A battle of course, the four. Uh, and then here we go. So his, his arms still held by cause Eiman and Deb Uchi and massage. She looked up at the sky, there was a flapping sound cause an eagle flew towards them from the blackness enveloping Malka soggy, like a giant shroud. It's silhouette hid the stars from view before it glided noisily down to the roof of the rice store house. And then this is the part that I highlighted to the fore retainers. The word battle sounded so melodramatic as to be laughable, but to Musashi at barely suffice to express his concept of what was to come.

Speaker 1:          01:44:45       Yes, yes. This part. So, so Musashi's it had this, another clan, another group that he's been battling with and the, the senior guy in the family, the senior guy from the school died or is, yeah, he's died. And this 13 year old boy is now the senior guy in the family. His name is again judo and he shows up. So he's challenges of, again, he challenges all these people to a fight and he shows up and they show up and he gets there. It's by some tree and of course it starts off Musashi. You're late. Cried a horse first. Pride, a hoarse voice. You took a shit on my dinner table. Many took encouragement from Musashi's declue declaration that he was alone believing it was a trick. They started looking around for Phantom seconds, allowed twisting off to one side. Allowed was followed. A split second later by the glint of Musashi sword flashing through the air.

Speaker 1:          01:45:49       Oh, someone had shot an arrow. The Arrow aimed at his face broke half falling behind his shoulder. The other half, the other half near the tip of his lowered sword, or rather where his sword had just been from Musashi, was already on the move. His hair bristling like a lion's mane. He was bounding toward the shadowy form behind the spreading pine getting Jiro hugged the tree trunk. Screaming help. I'm scared. Ghazi Moan jumped forward. A howling is though the blow had struck him, but it was too late. Musashi sword slice to two foot strip of bark off the trunk. It fell to the ground by can gyros, blood covered head. It was the act of a ferocious demon Musashi ignoring the others had made straight for the boy and it seemed he had had this in mind from the, the assault was of a savagery beyond conception. Can Gyros death did not reduce the Yoshi goes Yoshi oak is fighting capacity in the slightest would had been nervous. Excitement rose to a level of murderer's frenzy.

Speaker 1:          01:47:07       And so that's how he kicks off the battle. There's the 13 year old boy and he goes right for him and cuts off his head. So, um, and this is the first time he starts using, uh, both sorts. I think this is the first time onlookers who had a clear view of him covered their eyes and horror. This is, as this battle continues, most more ghastly still was the site of the dead and wounded left in his wake. As he continued his tactical retreat up the path, he reached a patch of open land where his pursuers surged forward in a mass attack. In a matter of seconds, four or five of men had been cut down. They lay scattered over a wide area, more urban testimony to the speed with which Musashi struck and moved on. He seemed to be everywhere at once, but for all is agile shifts and Dodgers Musashi clung to one basic strategy.

Speaker 1:          01:47:56       He never attacked a group from the front or the side always. Oh bleakly add an exposed corner whenever a battery of Samurai approached him head on, he somehow contrived to shift like lightening to a corner of their formation from which he could confront only one or two of them at a time. In this way, he managed to keep them essentially in the same position, but eventually Musashi was bound to be worn down eventually to his opponents seemed to be, seemed bound to find a way to thwart his method of attack. To do this, they would need to form themselves into two large forces before and behind him. Then he would be in the in even greater danger.

Speaker 4:          01:48:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:48:37       It took them all Musashi's resourcefulness to stop that from happening at some point. Musashi Jew, his smaller sword and started a fight with both hands while the large sword in his right hand was smeared with blood up to the hilt and the fist that held at the small sword in his left hand was clean and though it picked up a bit of flesh the first time it was used, it continued to sparkle greedy for blood. Musashi himself was not fully aware that he had drawn it even though he was wielding it with the same deafness as the larger sword. So he's just getting after it with two swords, you're going to eventually run. Crowd cried a thousand voices, you fighting by herself. Ron Run while you can, so he just crushes everyone. There's another weapon that I don't know if they talk about this book that he was quite adept at using as I understand it, before he began fighting with two swords and it goes by number of different names in English. Sometimes it's called the juts or a jetty. J U, t, t, e in Japanese. It's the Damian's 10 hands literally.

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       And it was a baton basically, if you could imagine, this will make sense in a moment. If you could imagine a half inch thick iron rod that's about 18 inches long or 12 inches long, that then has what looks like the clip of a say ballpoint pen. Uh, that is a little, that is pulled away from that, uh, rod so that you have a space in between this hook effectively and the rod palace guards and so on would use these as the equivalent of a police badge because they were forbidden from having swords in certain quarters because they could be used to assassinate higher ranking officials and so on. And you could use that in combination with a sword to, uh, effectively Perry or catch the bleed in between those two prongs and then toss it away or a twisted away or just use it to temporarily arrest to the use of that bleed and then pull your own long sword and cut someone down. And we saw she was very adept as I understand it, at using the day before he started using two sorts. You could also just use, it just didn't like clubs.

Speaker 1:          01:51:13       It's a big, which I'm sure this is exactly what it was used for. Now, as the story progresses, you know, he matures and and starts moving into a little bit of a different phase and this is kind of where the first time he starts, he's, he's wounded and he's traveling and eventually he lays up for the night after they had said good night. Musashi went to his room where he lay awake in the dark, his eyes glistening the way of the Samurai. He concentrated on this concept as it applied to himself and to his sword. Suddenly he saw the truth, the techniques of a swordsman. We're not his goal. He sought the all embracing way of the sword. The sword was to be far more than a simple weapon. It had to be an answer to life's questions. The way of [inaudible], Kenshin and dot j months master Nami was too narrowly military to hidebound. It would be up to him to add to it. It's human aspect to give it greater profundity, greater loftiness for the first time he asked whether it was possible for an insignificant human to become one with the universe. So he's starting to uh,

Speaker 2:          01:52:36       like I said maturity. Do you got one? Yeah, I have one which I think is philosophically very similar and brings back one of the characters that you will about earlier. Uh, and uh, refers to a lesson that he learns from head learned from Taco on. And here's how it goes. It wasn't that he, that's Misashi had forgotten the lesson talk one had taught him. The truly in that is the truly brave man is one who loves life, cherishing it as a treasure that once forfeited can never be recovered. He will knew that to live was more than to merely survive. That's the one that I highlighted. The problem was how to imbue this life with meaning, have to ensure that he, that his day would cast a bright ray of light into the future even if it became necessary to give up that life for a cause. If see if he succeeded in doing this, the length of his life, 20 years or 70 made a little difference. A lifetime was only an insignificant interval in the endless flow of time.

Speaker 1:          01:53:39       I think I've heard you say that quote before like I'm to just surviving. Living is not just surviving. That's kind of wild and maybe this is where I got, maybe this is what I think I've heard you say the quote, but I think I've heard you say that concept before. Yeah, I have and maybe, I mean this is where it incepted me 20 years ago. It was in massaging. He ends up with a guy named EERE who sort of a student of his and they're living in the mountains and again, I think this is, this is as, as they, as he's starting to mature and grow in this area where he's going to where he is. It's a mountainous area in Japan and for those of you that haven't been in Japan, it's got some incredibly beautiful, beautiful mountains and incredible, yeah, beautiful. Even right outside

Speaker 2:          01:54:24       of Tokyo for people who are ever thinking of going, ah, there's a place called [inaudible] goal, which is n I k k o and the o is long, but Nico and they have beautiful temples and mountains. That is where I did the Japanese horseback archery. Just as a, as a side note on the Japanese horseback archery. It was so great. So there are, there are not, as you would imagine in many schools for horseback archery, but one of the s, one of the families, one of the clans that still exists, the Ogasawara. So the Ogasawara as the family and then, or do like Yeu is the school. And that, that do you comes up a lot in Musashi's life. If you look at the history, it's like such and such, do such and such. Do you like the school of whatever and Ogasawara or do you, uh, Japanese horseback archery is what I ended up studying with one of the members of the Oga.

Speaker 2:          01:55:16       So out of family and we did it in Nico, which a stunning place to train. And, uh, just as a little, a little, a little bit of context on what exactly this means. So the ceremonial version of Japanese horseback archery entails a straight away that is marked off in, in the, in my case with a metal rods like rebar. So you effectively have these stakes in the ground that are about three feet high of rebar and like every five feet, two parallel lines running, let's call it 300 or 500 feet. And you get on a horse at the very beginning of this track in there, three targets laid out, uh, equally distance over that 500 foot space. Uh, the first one probably comes up at about a hundred meters and they're about the size of a big dinner plate and you're on the horse. The saddle is wood, so you don't sit on it.

Speaker 2:          01:56:15       A, you do, you squat above it and you have Tabi on which of these splits socks and you don't have shoes on in these, uh, stirrups that actually do not enclose the foot, uh, around. They didn't circle the foot. They, you stick it in kind of like a slipper and you have a really wide stance. And then you have a bow, which is about six feet long, in my case, in my left hand. And the bottom of the bow, you keep inside your thigh and then you have arrows that are stuck into your belt on your lower back and your first Arrow is knocked. And then you pull the line slightly and lock it down with your index fingers so that there's tension on him. And then you have the reins and you, you take off at a full gallop and then you throw the rains down and you fly with you gallop with no control.

Speaker 2:          01:57:08       The horse and these rebar that are set every five feet, keep the horse galloping in a straight direction and you fire the first hour of the first target, and then you have to reload your Arrow by reaching to your back, pulling their hair out. And there's a really tech, technical, somewhat complicated way of knocking the air very, very quickly while you're riding a horse. And then you intend to hit the next two targets. Uh, while you're yelling, there's certain things you're supposed to yell as you shoot at your target. And Ah, it's, it's an incredible, incredible demonstration. And they do this at the temples in Nico, which to me is what comes to mind in terms of imagery when we're talking about his experience in these mountainous regions. And A, yeah, lesson number one, or you do not want to fall off and people do fall off because if you fall off your horse, you get trampled by the horse and you hit the rebar.

Speaker 2:          01:58:04       Uh, but, uh, the reason I brought this up is that, uh, everyone has seen restaurants say that say established 1946 established 1987 established whatever. And The Sun Pretty Young Guy in his mid thirties, really strong. The bow I shot had maybe like a 60 pound or 65 pound tension, which is surprisingly difficult for people who have not done much archery to hold that at full extension for a period of time. Uh, especially on a horse, it's like 65 is, is 70 pounds is quite legit on a longbow or recurve bow. And he was pulling a bow that was 120 pounds, like nothing. And his jacket, he had what, what might look like a sort of a shiny like 1980s like breakdancing jacket is kind of what it looked like with like the, the t like the elastic tube portions on their wrists. And on the back it said Olga Sawada Yob Oussama established 1157 let's just like, yeah this goes back away. Did you hit the targets at the very end? I did. Yeah. You got them. Cause you know, shooting from vehicles is really, really hard. Shooting guns from vehicles. I mean it's just hard. I can't, I can't even imagine trying to do about Arrow horseback on a wooden saddles. Yeah, it's a, it's definitely a different thing. I was very surprised that I actually ended up hitting the targets. But uh, yeah, at the very end. How long did you train it for?

Speaker 2:          01:59:42       Another thing I would not recommend a, I crammed it into a week. I had a week, I have a week to train and you know how to ride a horse before I had some experience. On a horse, but western and western style for people don't know. If you think Rodeo, uh, where you're, you're, you're effectively seated in the saddle. It's kind of like the Harley Davidson of, of horse riding. Thanks. Your feet are out in front of you or you hear your heels are dropped, you don't post. And uh, Japanese is somewhere between, it's, it's, it's closer to English where you'd be a more elevated and the position is very, very different. You're, you're effectively an, almost a sumo stance. Like you're, you're very much abducted, like your, your groin is very, very open. So I was extremely sore. I felt like I was doing like suspended squat practice for hours every day.

Speaker 2:          02:00:38       So after a few days of that, uh, pretty uncomfortable and we'd lost three days, I want to say to rain when we, we couldn't, it was too dangerous for the horses and the humans to train doing anything in those conditions. So we had about four, I'd say four days of real training. So speaking of rain there, up there, uh, Musashi and EERE are up there and well here we go into the book. As autumn waned, the insect voices faded into silence, leaves withered and fell Musashi and at Yorie finished their cabin because they built a cabin and address themselves to the task of making the land ready for planting. One day while serving the land we saw, she suddenly found himself thinking it was like a diagram of the social unrest that it lasted for a century after the own in war. Such thoughts aside, it was not an encouraging picture. Unknown to Musashi hot too hot Hotan go. Hodra had over the centuries, been buried many times by volcanic ash from Mount Fuji and the tone river

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       had repeatedly flooded the flatlands whenever when the weather was fair and the land bone dry, but whenever there was heavy rains, the water carved out new channels carrying great quantities of dirt and rock along with it. There was no principal stream into which smaller ones flowed naturally. The nearest thing to this being a wide base in that locks efficiently, sufficient capacity. Artists are lacked sufficient capacity to either water or drain the area as a whole. The most urgent need was obvious to bring the water under control. So we've got this big piece of land and he thinks, okay, I'm gonna turn this into a farm. He doesn't really know that there's no pathway for the streams that when the water comes down out of the mountains and when it rains, he doesn't know that there's nowhere for it to go. It doesn't make sense to the water.

Speaker 3:          02:02:28       So it just kind of floods everything. I'm still, the more he looked, the more he had questioned why the area was under undeveloped. It won't be easy. He thought excited by the challenge posed, joining the water and earth to create productive fields was not much different than leading men and women in such a way that civilization might bloom to Musashi. It seemed that his goal was in complete agreement with his ideals of swordsmanship. He'd come to see the way of the sorta new light a year or two earlier, he had wanted only to conquer all rivals, but now the idea that the sword existed for the purpose of giving him power over other people was unsatisfying to cut people down to triumph over them to display the limits of one strength seemed increasingly vain. He wanted to conquer himself, to make life itself submit to him, to cause people to live rather than die.

Speaker 3:          02:03:23       The way of the sword should not be used merely for his own perfection. It should be a source of strength for governing governing people and leading them to peace and happiness. He realized his grand ideals were no more than dreams and would remain so as long as he lacked the political authority to implement them. But here in this wasteland, he needed neither rank nor power. He plunged into the struggle with joy and enthusiasm day in and day out. Stumps were uprooted. Gravel sifted land level, soil and rocks made into dykes Musashi. Ori worked from before dawn until after the stars were shining bright in the sky. Now as he's doing this, the villagers keep coming by and they say, what do they think they're doing and how do they think they can live in a place like that? And you're wasting your time. That's what all the villagers are saying to them. They've seen this for, you know, since 1100 or whatever, they've seen this place get flooded and he keeps going. He keeps, you know, trying. And every time he makes some progress, he the, it'll rain and everything gets washed away or it'll get flooded and then he thinks he's doing okay. And it's a big snow in the mountains, so everything, but then it falls

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       into every, all the water comes down again. So he goes on, he keeps working the land, he keeps trying to make it work. Back to the book. Musashi carried on in his stubborn struggle throughout the winter, into the second month of the new year. It took several weeks of strenuous labor to dig ditches, drain the water off, piled dirt for a dyke, and then cover it with heavy rocks. Three weeks later, everything was again washed away. Look, you already said we're wasting our energy on something impossible. Is that the way of the sword? The question struck close to the bone, but Musashi would not give. In only a month passed before the next disaster, a heavy snow fall followed by a quick fall EERE on his return trips from the temple for food inevitably war along face for the people there rode him mercilessly about Musashi's failure and finally Musashi himself began to lose heart for two full days and on into a third he sat silently brooding and staring at his field than it dawned on him.

Speaker 1:          02:05:42       Suddenly, unconsciously he had been trying to create a neat square field like those common in other parts of the plane, but this was not what the terrain called for here. Despite the general flatness, there were slight variations in the lay of the land and the quality of the soil that argued for an irregular shape. What a fool I've been, he exclaimed allowed. I tried to make the water flow where I thought it should and force the dirt to stay where I thought it ought to be, but it didn't work. How could it water's water. Dirts dirt. I can't change nature. What I've got to do is learn to be a servant to the water and a protector of the land in his own way. He had submitted to the attitude of the peasants. On that day, he became nature's man servant. He sees trying to impose his will on nature and let nature lead the way, while at the same time seeking out possibilities beyond the grasp of other inhabitants of the plane. The snow came again and another fall, the muddy water. Ooh, slowly over the plane. But Musashi had had time to work out as new approach and his field remained intact. The same rules must apply to governing people. He said to himself in his notebook, he wrote, do not attempt to oppose the way of the universe, but first, make sure you know the way of the universe.

Speaker 1:          02:07:23       As I was, uh, telling one of my seal buddies about this, we were talking about that you can't, you can't, as a leader, a lot of times people want to change people. You want to change

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       and you, you just, you can't change people. Right? I mean, you can shift them and vacant change themselves, but when you try and impose change on someone, you try and make someone what you want them to be. It's very difficult to do, if not impossible. I was talking about this one had a guy in a seal platoon and he had potential, right? But he had some flaws, you know, he was a blowout mouth in that kind of thing and just wanted like to bring them along and tried everything. Beatings, um, counselings, um, you know, befriending, um, more beatings, did everything and, and you know, he would like make slight adjustments for a little while and then he'd go back to just being the way he was. And eventually I said, okay, well we have to, that's the way he is. That's the way this person is.

Speaker 3:          02:08:24       And you know, how do we work with him? So he's working within the confines of things that he can do and do them acceptably. But I think people get caught on the idea that they're going to change people. And it's really hard and you see this, especially with people getting involved in relationships with people that they think they're going to be able to change and you're not going to be able to do it. I have a question for you. Juggle in, in your own life experience. How do you separate the way of the universe? Meaning in you personally, the things that are just you that you shouldn't try to change versus the things that you should try to improve these? I think that there, there's the temptation for a lot of people to say, well that's just the way I am, but it's, it absolves them of the responsibility of doing the work.

Speaker 3:          02:09:13       I got asked a similar question and it'll tie into it, but I got asked by, um, I was working with a company the other day and a guy asked, you know, if I've got a guy that's really good at something but a person that's not really good shit, should I just give up on trying to get the person that's not good at that job? Give up on them and just let the person that's good at it. Do it. And I said, well, yes and no. I mean, if we have somebody that is a really good shot, like he's a sniper, but we've got a guy that's not a good shot. Okay, so we're going to give the sniper all the good missions and he's going to go do all the tough shots. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. That doesn't mean we just let the other guy never learned how to shoot.

Speaker 3:          02:09:49       No, we actually continue to train him and make him better and I think it's the same thing with your, your your individual self. Right? If I've got weaknesses, I don't just say, well, I'm just going to avoid being in those areas where I'm weak. I'm going to actually go and try and get better at them. Now I'm not going to make that the focus of my life. Right. I'm not going to try and become a ballerina. Right. What I like to be more flexible. Absolutely. Do I need to work on that? Absolutely. But I'm not trying to become a ballerina. I wouldn't focus on that because it would be a significant waste of my time. End of my entire life in a very fruitless situation. But that doesn't mean I shouldn't try and be more flexible. Right? So I think you, you, you still apply time too to try and improve it, but you don't waste, you know, you don't waste a valuable energy. You'd still look at what you're good at and say, you know, I'm better at doing Jujitsu, I'm better at whatever.

Speaker 2:          02:10:44       Can I tell you, uh, one of the thoughts that for whatever reason consumed my mind for about an hour and a half during my silent meditation retreat, I was thinking about giraffes can't dance this book, this, this demon slayer that crushes me on Amazon. Always buy like five spots. When I launch a book and I started thinking about how incredible it would be to take Jocko the cartoon character, uh, as seen in the Jocko approved logo on your t and to have a parody of that book called Jocko, can't dance with like thought bubbles of what you're thinking throughout the book. In any case, for whatever reason, that is what my mind decided to settle on. And, uh, I'm sorry. Uh,

Speaker 3:          02:11:37       so confession over confession. Consider do you find that yourself that you say like, Oh, I'm not good at this Roman to avoid it? Or do you find yourself getting focused? Cause you know, you're talking about what Musashi's wha what they described Musashi do and as earlier, which is I only worry about things that are beating me. Right? I only worry about the opponent, the baby, just like the only book you think about as this book, giraffes can't dance, which is the one book that beats you because, and that's what you're focused on. Your worry about these other books that you kicked the crap out. I also just like talking about it because I love the fact that it's called giraffes can't dance and it kicks your ass. Do you think you get focused on things that are, that you shouldn't be focused on or that you're wasting time on? Uh, I, I, you kind of know what you're good at. I do. Uh, I think that I've become better at

Speaker 2:          02:12:24       working on or distinguishing between low level weaknesses in high level weaknesses. And what I mean by that is if you imagine, say a people have seen like a champagne pyramid where sometimes built at weddings where you stack up all of these champagne glasses and you pour into one or it could be any type of glass and it cascades down into the others. Uh, where you could think of it through a domino analogy. I use this analogy a lot looking at lead dominoes. Like what can I do if I have a task list, let's say, which of these five tasks we'll make all of the others easier or irrelevant. And that'll help me sequence things in the right order so that I'm not wasting energy. Uh, if I have 10 units of energy, I'd rather focus on identifying at least to begin with the lead dominoes.

Speaker 2:          02:13:18       And so a high level weakness would be a week. A lead domino is something that has downstream negative effects on many different areas even, uh, that can compromise your strengths, right? Uh, so for me, for instance, I think, uh, for a very long time I viewed, uh, I only viewed impatience through the lens of the benefits of aggression. Because having a good, authentic has always been my model ever since. I became fascinated by Dan Gable who is about as close to a hundred percent offense, legendary wrestling a competitor and coach, uh, ah man, I have a lot of stories about Dan Gable, uh, incredible, incredible guy. But uh, I, what I've realized in the last few years for instance, is that there are low level weaknesses. Let's say I am not a programmer. I am not good at a, B, c, d or e skill that is more of a, a technician's craft. I will not spend time on those things if I can delegate it or outsource it. But if there are core psychological traits that are higher order that can negatively impact other things, then I've realized, uh, for the long haul. Uh, I do want to at least experiment with developing those capacities.

Speaker 3:          02:14:51       I think has helped me a lot is I'm always, and I was, when I was in the seal teams, I was always looking at other people. I was always looking at their leadership. I was looking at what they're doing and I was looking at why they weren't getting along. I was looking at what was wrong with the platoon. And as I would sit there and watch these people, I would learn from because, and I'd say, you know, I'd see two people that didn't get along. And I'd say, wow, why don't get, why can't these guys get along? What's wrong with them? And I'd watch him and I'd see that, you know, this one guy has a giant ego. Oh. And so is the other guy. And instead of one of them disarming the other guy's ego, they both can't figure that out. And so they're just battling and it's, you know, you got that in inside of a seal platoon.

Speaker 3:          02:15:30       It's a horrible thing. And, and so as I'd watch them, it allowed me that, then I could see it in myself where I would see, oh, I like, I've, I've got frustrated with someone I'd say, or I'd get, I have a negative thought about someone. I think, why do I have that negative thought about that person that's actually a bad ass? Or it seems like a really strong personality or a strong presence. Right. Why do I have that? Oh, I have that cause that's my ego. And it's the same thing with when I see people getting excited, um, I don't think excitement is usually a positive thing. I mean it's not, it's not a negative thing, but sometimes people in a meeting, someone just immediately has an opinion and, and I think, and I watched their, their opinion fall apart because they didn't listen long enough.

Speaker 3:          02:16:15       They didn't assess things long enough. And so I hear them state their opinion and they stayed it with vigor and with, with conviction. And then you listen to it and all of a sudden they, they, they can't help but look bad because what they thought was wrong. And I probably had the same thoughts as I sat there and I kept my mouth shut and I listened. And, and so I'd see people do that. And I said, you know what, when you're in a meeting and there's people talking about things, do, you don't need to say anything. You don't need to appear stupid or whatever it is. He better do appear stupid, then open your mouth and remove all doubt, right? This is just, but I would learn these things about people, which I think were, were helpful to me just by watching an and seeing people and being really, uh, really kind of a jerk in my own mind.

Speaker 3:          02:16:56       Like I watch people like a jerk. Like, why would you do that? What's wrong with you? Very accusatory tone in my own head. But then it was really easy for me to flip that back on myself all the time and say, well wait a second. You do that too. Wait a second. You make that same mistake. So I think that from a psychological perspective, I think what's given me a good perspective of my own psychology is watching other people intently and closely with the, with the goal of actually helping them correct that of bill going up to the guy and say, hey man, this is your ego versus that guy's ego and you're either going to want to, you is going to have to disarm the other one or your guys are never going to go along and this never do a move forward. And so I think that really helped me out a lot. I'm sure

Speaker 2:          02:17:39       it, and I have found certainly that there are many benefits in my case of being a solo practitioner, so to speak, uh, being, uh, unemployed slash self employed for decades now. But the, one of the clear downsides is that I don't have that in person peer group to observe or superiors or subordinates to observe it with the rare exception of a handful of employees now. But the, what I ended up doing for myself to try to improve because I didn't have, I assumed, and I think this is good for a lot of people, do assume that you, you may not have sufficient self awareness to accurately self diagnose your weaknesses and strengths. So I would seek out environments that made it very obvious. And the way I did that, and I think we saw, she in a way alludes to this, uh, is if you say are on the battlefield in massage case, your strengths and weaknesses or at least your weaknesses tend to become clearer or magnified.

Speaker 2:          02:18:52       So if I could put myself into a really intense training environment like Aka in San Jose, a lot of professionals there, uh, at the time, Cain Velasquez and a number of others and training with Dave in a handful of folks, I could watch my response to increasing levels of stress. Like how did I respond to extreme heat? What was the self talk when I wanted to quit? Did I, uh, at what point was I inclined to try to find someone easy to roll with? Like, how many rounds did it take? Right? Wasn't it? And uh, and then could I then I would note that, and I would actually take notes. I bring my notebook and just you can see I have notebooks everywhere here and I would note the, not just the technical learnings and what I wanted to approve, but the, the, the decisions and the self talk that I made that I want to improve upon and experiment with that. So I used the physical arena as a way to try to identify the high level weaknesses that I could work on because uh, everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Right. So it's all great and theoretically academically beautiful to sit down and try to self analyze when you're journaling in the morning, which I also do, but it's quite another thing to be like, okay, tough guy.

Speaker 3:          02:20:11       Yeah. Even with that long explanation, I just gave it, look in all these people, I didn't care. I wasn't consciously thinking, actually it wasn't even consciously thinking about it from a psychological perspective. I was just thinking it from a pragmatic, here's two guys, why don't they get along? And then when I would see myself, dude, I go, oh, you're, you're like, you're doing the same stupid stuff. It wasn't like this, um, you know, this idea of I was looking at myself and I was just doing what I had to do. Right. I guess there's always the subconscious feeling of like trying to do better and trying to self improve, but I'm not a person that has the, the constant like, um, I'm trying to self improve. I think it's just a, it's just a natural thing. Yeah. I'm trying to get better of course, but that's not, I don't think about it. That's, I guess that's my point. I don't think about, I'm not focused on it. I'm just doing it. I'm just doing it and living it yet. Well, I think in [inaudible] in

Speaker 2:          02:21:08       your case, and uh, I have, well we have some mutual friends, I mean from the seals, but also a force recon and a number of, of friends who have, uh, been engaged at very high levels in elite ranks within the military. And I think that in my experience thus far, uh, most of them have, whether it's by virtue of the filtering that their careers impose on them, right? I mean you have thousand people start at step one. How many make it to step a hundred? Uh, that they, they self select an are selected to have a high degree of what I would consider or what you could consider mindfulness, which is usually associated with like hippies and San Francisco with Didgeridoo is and burning man and so on. It's, it's a buzzword there. But I think the ability to detach in that way comes naturally to you. And to many people I know who also have made it to step 100, they just seem in a military context, if you don't have that you and certainly you can get killed or get washed out for many different reasons. But I think if one of them seems to be, if you no self awareness,

Speaker 3:          02:22:27       you just, you get broken or you get disqualified at some point or, or you, you get as good as the machine can make you. And I think that's, that's the real difference. You get as good as the machine, the machine's going to make you good. Right? Right. But you the only person that can take you pass what the machine can make as you. And so if you're not self aware, if you can't, if you can't figure that out, if you can't look in the mirror and see like things that you can correct, then you're, you're just going to be what the machine made you, which is a high quality item. I mean, you know, the military is filled with some high quality guys, great guys, fabulous guys that perform outstanding. But then there's like this one more little level of guys that are where you, you look at him and you go, man, that guy is really good at what, why is that?

Speaker 3:          02:23:11       That's because that guy, the machine got him to here and he's looking at myself going, what can I do better? He's got that detachment and that's definitely, definitely important. I got to introduce somebody in this book now, um, that there's, his name is Sasaki. Could Jiro Gun Room? I'd have to see the last part. Yeah. He got the first g. A. N. R. Y you got new you guys to be a hard to say. Come to, I guess I'm going to go with what I'm calling. So this guy, and he dances the in and out throughout the book, but this is Musashi's uh, archrival the other swordsmen that's got this incredible reputation only. He's been a little bit more, he stays on the scene more. Musashi is going in trying to farm and doing other things. And this guy's kind of on the scene and there's, there's one part where these elderly gentlemen are talking about who is truly the best swordsman Slash Samurai in Japan.

Speaker 3:          02:24:09       And here we go to the book. As he compared the two, he had to admit that the most Daimiel am I saying that right? The time you meal would prefer could he came from a good family and he had started the art of war thoroughly despite his youth. He'd developed a formidable style of his own and he gained considerable to fame as a fighter. The story of his brilliant defeat of men from the old Bata Academy on the banks of the Sumida river. And again at the dike on the condo river was already well known. Nothing had been heard from Musashi for some time. His victory at each show, each GI Joe Gi had made his reputation, but that had been years ago and soon afterward had spread this story that the story was exaggerated, that Musashi was a seeker of after fame, who had trumped up the fight, made a flashy attack, and then fled to mount. He, every time we saw she did something praiseworthy, a spate of rumors followed denigrating his character and ability. It had reached the point where even the mention of his name usually met with critical remarks or, or else people ignore them entirely. As the son of a nameless warrior in the mountains of me, Masaka his lineage was insignificant.

Speaker 3:          02:25:33       So he kind of faded and he does some dumb stuff too, right? Like he does dumb things like he's a young, you didn't come from that from the ranks that have people that were counseling him and keep him in line. So he did dumb stuff like have battles against whole castles and attack people. He was kind of crazy. Yeah. Right. And so his reputation and then of course, you know this is like a, I guess ancient social media, right? There was rumors and they would post signs about people and they would do these things to denigrate people's reputations and such. And they had done that considerably to massage it.

Speaker 2:          02:26:07       Just thinking about how labor intensive it would be, you're talking about spreading posters like to hand create piles of posters that you then go post to denigrate someone. Like the equivalent of a tweet was like sitting down for a week and a hand making posters to put around town

Speaker 3:          02:26:26       and they do it in this book that you do. I mean it's full times. They go on both sides. People write sign, Musashi does it, the other people do it. It's um, yeah, it's, it's crazy. And we're getting toward getting closer. Closer. We saw she's wandering in the mountains and here we go back to the book. At times he was so tortured with his sword.

Speaker 4:          02:26:55       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:26:55       It seemed like a weapon that turned against him. Among the possibilities he considered was choosing the easy way. If he could bring himself to live in a comfortable, ordinary way with Ohsu, life would be simple. Almost any fife would be willing to pay him enough to live on perhaps 500, 2000 bushels. But when he put it, but when he put it to himself in the form of a question, the answer was always no. An easy existence imposed restrictions. He could not submit to them.

Speaker 4:          02:27:28       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:27:29       Three's get, he got the idea, you know, I could just marry to get a good job, make a hundred k a year, we'll call it good. He doesn't like that though, doesn't it? Not like it. The easy path has restrictions. It is the discipline that provides freedom. Apparently for Musashi

Speaker 2:          02:27:48       done as a contemporary example, uh, one of my a, I would consider him a teacher. He certainly become a friend, but a political originally at least when he came to the u s a Polish political refugee named Jersey Gregorich. He's now in his sixties lives in Woodside, California, and he's a world champion and world record holder and Olympic weightlifting. Yeah, as is his wife. He, he, that was a good podcast by the way. Oh yeah, he's, he's awesome. He's so salty. And to give people a little bit of back on the first time I met him, I was just at the time suffering from a malaise in a general fatigue with the hypersensitivity of the bay area. And I walked in to meet him for the first time to get an assessment and we sat down and we drank Marco Polo black tea. It's the only tea that he drinks and he's like, have a seat.

Speaker 2:          02:28:43       So I sit down and we're talking, he's asking me about my goals, about my athletic background, past injuries and he's sitting across from me is ease in great shape. He's in his sixties he, he can still do well as an example, I've seen him on an endo board. You know, those aren't some balance boards, like a wobble board on top of a cylinder with a loaded barbell. He's holding a loaded barbell in a position like a hand clean on an Indo board. Uh, he's in his sixties throw it up, you know, for like 150, 200 pounds and land in a full ass to heels, snatch on an Endovar that is legit. And so he reached across sipping tea and then he stopped mid, mid thought and reached across and sort of pit pinched my right to and just said you owe to fat. So I just loved this guy. Like after that I was like, yes, we are going to work together. But his one of his mantras that he uses for everything is easy choices, hard life, hard choices, easy life.

Speaker 2:          02:29:48       Discipline Equals Freedom for sure. That's awesome. That is awesome. Did you like get on the program with him? I did for quite a period of time. Yeah. And where you were you traveling down? I mean, how does do following instructions and trust me coaching you are traveled down regularly and um, made excellent progress. It's very to do Olympic weight lifting the way that Jersey would want you to do it. Uh, and which is the way I would want to do it. You really need hands on instruction. It's highly, highly, highly technical. And, uh, also you need a logical progression because most people who just want to do a weekend course and figure out the snatch, they do not have any of the ankle or shoulder mobility, thoracic spine mobility to even perform the right movement regardless of who the instructor is. They could have a 500 time world champion teaching them and doing video recording, but if they had don't have the mobility, there's going to hurt themselves.

Speaker 2:          02:30:45       So I went down regularly and then, uh, when I was traveling with, sent him video and he would reply with video commentary, a great experience. I mean, I still think the Jersey style relatively narrow stance as to the grass, uh, overhead squat, one of the best movements. What, how, why does his grip when he does that? It's a snatch grip. So it'd be a wider, wider grip, but he can, there are videos of Jersey people can look them up. J E R Z y Gregorich Gre, g o r e. K a. Their videos that he is one of the most flexible mobile humans I've ever seen any strong as an ox. But he can with his feet together, uh, holding a say 35 pound plate overhead with his hands flat underneath it. Like he's holding a dinner platter, go down into a perfect squat with his chest up, asked to his heels, holding that overhead with his fingers, basically touching. Yeah. Which people might say, Oh, I could do that. Trust me. You can't like, trust me, you cannot do it.

Speaker 1:          02:31:57       That's, that's awesome. So we're getting towards the, towards the end here, this again, this, um, rivalry is brewing and finally there is a, speaking of social media, there is a command issued by the castle. And here's what it says on the 13th day of this month at eight o'clock in the morning on Fukushima in the Nevado straights of Buzan Sasaki, could Jiro gone through a Samurai of this Phif will add his lordship's bidding fight about with me. You motto Masashi Masana, a Ronin from the province of Nema Soka 80, strictly forbidden for supporters of either swordsmen to go to his aid or set forth on the water between the mainland and Fushi Nama and Funy Shama, sorry until 10 o'clock on the morning of the 13th. No sight seeing vessels, passenger ships and fishing boats will be permitted to enter the straights.

Speaker 2:          02:33:01       1612 that, that, that, that document right there. So there you go. It's on, they're going to fight. And for people wondering what Ronan is that as a master list warrior that is a Samurai without a Lord floating a floating person, Nin person. And uh, you could think of them in some cases. I mean they would either be freelance, self directed learners, an autodidact like Musashi or they'd be mercenaries. So ruined in, we're also swords for higher negative connotation to it. Negative connotation. God, I would say for sure a negative connotation, uh, simply because, uh, the lineage and association in Japan, Japanese culture is so important that if you, if you don't have a master or a particular fif that you're associated with a particularly if you come from, you are born of unknown origins are from a no name at warrior. It is very much a, an important class distinction. And Saki also as I understand it, and this may come up later, but used a slightly different sword. Uh, and yes and

Speaker 1:          02:34:25       uh, we we can get to that. Do you want me to hold it? No, no, it's cool. He, he uses a sword called the drying pole. And for years until I was actually prepping for this podcast, I thought that that was a bad ass name for a sword of course. But what I thought I was thought to myself, that means like drives you have your blood. That's what I thought it meant. It drives you have is of your blood. And then as I was researching for this podcast, it's actually, and correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I found, there's a method of Clo, of drying your clothes on a stick, a long stick, and his sword was longer than most swords. And so the full name of it was the closed drawing sword. Did I get all that right?

Speaker 2:          02:35:13       That part, I'm not sure if it makes sense to me. And I remember when I was in Japan a number of years ago, I go back as often as I possibly can and I'm still in close contact with my host family. I've been to my brother's weddings and so on. It's just been fantastic. And I went back and I went to a Japanese Sword Museum, which was incredibly hard to find and it was empty. And the, I'm decent at a, still decent at reading Japanese, but it's been a long time and it's been almost 20 years, more than 20 years since I formally studied it. So given there are thousands of characters, one gets a little rusty and I went into this Japanese sword museum and the displays and everything you can imagine. I mean it's Japan, things are clean, meticulous. And I went in and it was just walls and walls of displays with different sorts from different areas.

Speaker 2:          02:36:06       So I mean swords were talking about swords from these arrows are, they're preserved and they look brand new. And I was walking around and there was a gentleman who is cleaning and I asked him a question at one point about how to pronounce a character and he proceeded to pause his cleaning and walk me through the entire museum explaining how each of them was used. And one of them, or one type I should say, which I believe is what Sasaki used. It is long and it's called the Daci. I think it's Dutchy and the difference of the most remarkable differences. A it, yes, it's very long and it is curved and it would be used very often by horsemen and it was curved so that they could strike down, uh, their opponents without getting the blades stuck in their bodies. Because if you have a straight blade or relatively straight played like a Katana, it's almost like having a straight bladed hatchet that you swing into a tree. It's like fuck. And it gets stuck. Well if you're on horseback, that's a big problem. You lose your sword,

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       you're in a very bad position. And so it would, it would be more of a slicing motion as opposed to a chopping motion and the Daci was very effective for that reason. It's also another reason that it tended to be longer. Yeah. Cause you're fighting from on top of a horse, so you've got to reach down. Yeah. Apparently they're saying that this sword was about nine to 12 inches longer than the normal sword and they gave it this name, that drawing Paul, which again I always thought was about, that's the way my mind works. Echo Charles, don't be laughing. Oh. Then it turned out it's just trying to, everything's there, were outside on a broom handle. Everything is cooler in my brain.

Speaker 1:          02:37:55       Uh Oh two who by the way, this whole time that she's been in and out, she's, she, they've never actually like gotten together as, as whatever mates or as permanent partners. Right. It's always just been this kind of thing. Very Japanese. Yeah. Um, oh is that very Japanese? Yeah. Yeah. I would say so. Just this a very what we would consider sort of awkward tension that never has some resolution. Right then that's then that's exactly what this is. And that's exactly where they've been for 962 pages of a book. Right. Awkward tension for 962 pages and God bless her, she's still like saying, Hey, I'm here for you. Even if even though he told her I love my sword and not you. Well now to be fair, he said, I love my sort more than I love you. No, he said, I don't dislike you. Which in the Musashi speak. Yeah. It's like I will love you until my dying. True. True. So she is going to say goodbye to him because there's, you know, this is, this is, uh, does it match where someone is going to die and it's, I guess I'm looking at it, it's a little bit, the older guy that is been out of practice against the young stud that's in the game fully. So it seems like people are thinking there's a good chance he's going to die.

Speaker 1:          02:39:24       So He's having that final conversation with her. Ohsu, please forgive me. I may seem harmless, but I'm not, not where you're concerned. I, I know that. Do you truly? Yes, but I beg you say one word for me. Just one word. Tell me that I'm your wife.

Speaker 5:          02:39:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:39:44       It would spoil it if I told you what you know already,

Speaker 5:          02:39:49       but, but

Speaker 1:          02:39:51       she was sobbing with her whole body, but with a burst of strength. She seized his hand and cried. Say it Sam, your wife throughout this life, he nodded slowly silently. Then one by one he pulled her delicate fingers from his arm and stood erect. A Samurai's wife must not weep and go to pieces when he goes off to laugh for me out to send me away with a smile. This may be your husbands last departure.

Speaker 1:          02:40:23       Both knew the time had come for a brief moment. He looked at her and smiled. Then he said until then, yes. Until then she wanted to return to smile, but only managed to hold back the tears. Farewell. He turned and walked with firms. Strides towards the water's edge. A parting word rose to her throat, but refuse to be uttered. The tears welled up irrepressibly she could no longer see him. The strong salty wind ruffled Musashi sideburns. His Komono flapped. Briskly saw Suki bring the boat a little closer though. He'd been waiting for over two hours and new Musashi was on the beach. Suzuki had carefully kept his eyes averted. Now he looked at Musashi and said right away, sir, we're the few strong rapid movements. He pulled the boat in when it touched the shore. Musashi jumped lightly into the prow and they moved out to see oh to stop the south.

Speaker 1:          02:41:33       The shout was too Taros. Another guy that's there on the scene. Oh two was running straight toward the water. He raced after her startled to Suki and Osu be joined the chase. Oh Sue, stop. What are you doing? Don't be foolish. Reaching her. Simultaneously they threw her arms around her and held her back. No, no, she protested. Shaking her at Sarah had slowly, you don't understand what, what are you trying to do? Let me sit down by myself. Her voice was calm when they released her and she walked with dignity to a spot a few yards away where she knelt on the sand, seemingly exhausted. But she had found her strength. She straightened her color, smooth her hair and bowed her head towards Musashi's little craft. Go without regrets. She said, that's how you do it right there. So again, it was mentioned or if, if I didn't explain that well enough, this battle is going to take place on a little island in the middle of a stream and I'm straight. Yeah. Or is it a straight, what's the difference between those two?

Speaker 2:          02:42:47       Um, well actually that's a great question. I, the way I said this, this is fun. Okay. So I mean a novel like this is created in your own head, right? It's an active experience of creating, right? So in my head, and maybe I don't know what a straight is, but the way I envisioned a straight was almost like a uh, small or extended so long, but narrow sand

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       bank in the middle of say a river or a but a wide river like Mississippi type. Yeah. That's kind of what I pictured. I pictured a wide, a wide, wide river that has a, a little uninhabited sorta strip of land in the middle. Yeah, exactly. That's what I picture. And that's what you picture too. So I guess we created the same thing. So he's in this boat and he's headed, obviously he's running late and as per usual, as per usual. And here we go to the book. So Suki may have this, what is it? This broken or in the bottom of the boat? I don't need it. Why do you want it? It's about the right size. Musashi said cryptically he held the slightly waterlogged or out with one hand. And squinted down at to see if it was straight. One edge of the blade was split off. He placed the order on his knee and totally absorbed, began carving with his short sword. Suzuki cast backward glances toward Shimo Sechi several times, but we saw, she seemed oblivious of the people he left behind. Was this the way a Samurai approached a life and death battle? Two towns, men like Suzuki. It was cold and heartless, so this is important. He picked up this old waterlogged or from the bottom boat says, can I have this? The guy says, yeah, sure. And now he starts carving it.

Speaker 1:          02:44:51       So Suki was growing more and more nervous with each stroke of the skull. He had broken out in a cold sweat. His heart was palpitating. How could a man going into battle be so calm? It would be a fight to the death, no question about that. Would he be taking a passenger back to the main land later or cruelly maimed corpse? There was no way of knowing Musashi thought Suzuki was like a white cloud floating across the sky. This was not opposed on Musashi's part four. In fact, he was thinking of nothing at all. He was, if anything, a little bored. He looked over the side of the boat at the swirling blue water. It was deep here, infinitely deep and alive with what seemed to be eternal life. But water had no fixed determined form. Was it not? Because man had a fixed determined form that he cannot possess eternal life.

Speaker 6:          02:45:49       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:45:50       Does not true life begin only when tangible form has been lost to Musashi's eyes. Life and death seemed like so much fraud off. He felt goose pimples on his skin, not from the cold water, but because his body felt a premonition. Fruit though his mind had risen above life and death, body and mind. We're not in a accord when every pore of his body as well of his mind. For God, there would remain nothing inside but being inside is being, but the water and the clouds. So he's going into a full on like trans. Yeah, full on. Transcend. Skipping ahead a little bit here. They arrive at the island, go straight in Musashi, flew off the quilted quote, the bow advanced at a very restrained pace. Says you could, could not bring himself to stroke with vigor. His arms moved only slightly exerting little force.

Speaker 1:          02:46:57       The sound of Bulbous was in the air. So Suki, yes sir. It's shallow enough here. There's no need to get close. You don't want to damage your boat. Besides, it's about time for the tide to turn silent. Lisa Zukie fixed his eyes on a tall, thin pine tree standing alone. Underneath it, the wind was playing with a brilliant red cloak. Suzuki started to point, but realize that Musashi had already seen his opponent keeping his eyes on God. UNRUH Musashi took a Russet hand towel from his Ob, folded it in four length wise and tied it around his wind blown hair. Then he shifted his sort of short sword to the front of his ob taking off as long sword. He laid it in the bottom of the boat and covered it with a read Matt in his right hand. He held the wooden sword he had made from the broken or this is far enough. He said, this is Suki,

Speaker 4:          02:48:04       so

Speaker 1:          02:48:06       he's going to fight the best swordsman in the world. He carves a wooden sword out of an or on the way leaves his long stored in the boat and there is a, this is a novel, but there's also some historic precedent for this. So he would routinely use wooden swords when dueling with opponents who are using live blades.

Speaker 1:          02:48:39       Okay, back to the book at that moment, Musashi, his Hakama, which is uh, pants. They're like, yeah, it's kind of like a judge. Japanese kilt, let's say, very, very long. Usually it comes down to the ankles, has it comma hitched, high on both sides, jumped lightly into the sea landing, so light be he barely made a splash. He strode rapidly toward the waterline is a wooden sword. Cutting through the spray, five steps, 10 steps. Suzuki abandoning his goal, watched in wonderment, unconscious of where he was, what he was doing has gone rouge street away from the pine like a red streamer has Polish scabbard caught the glint of the sun. Musashi gone through, planted his feet and resolutely in the sand, unwilling to give up an inch. We saw, she stopped and stood, still exposed to the water and the wind. A hint of a grin appeared on his face. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:49:43       he said quietly, there was an unearthly fierceness in his eyes are forced pooling. So irresistibly, it threatened to draw Kuduro inexcusably into the peril and destruction. The waves washed his wooden sword, gone. Roos were the eyes that shot fire, the bloodthirsty flame burned in his pupils like the rainbows of fierce intensity seeking to terrify and debilitate Musashi. No answer. Musashi, the sea rumbled ominously in the distance. The tide lapped and murmured at the two men's feet. You're late again, aren't you? Is that your strategy? As far as I'm concerned, it's a cowardly ploy. It's two hours past the appointed time. I was here at eight just as promised. I've been waiting. Musashi did not reply. You did this at Ici Joji and before that at the [inaudible]. Your method seems to be to throw your opponent off by deliberately making him wait. That trick will get you nowhere.

Speaker 1:          02:50:54       We've got Unruh now. Prepare your spirit and come forward bravely so future generations won't laugh at you. Come ahead and fight Musashi. The end of his scabbard rose high behind him as he drew the great drying pole with his left hand. He slid off the scabbard and food into the water waiting just long enough for a wave to strike the refund retreat. Musashi suddenly said in a quiet voice, you've lost code. Jiro what? Gone Rue was shaken to the core. The fights been fought. I say, you've been defeated. What are you talking about? If you're going to win, you wouldn't throw your scabbard away. You've cast away your future, your life words nonsense. Too Bad could ready to fall. Do you want to get it over with? Fast come, come forward. You bastard.

Speaker 1:          02:51:58       Oh Musashi's cry in the sound of the water. Rose to a crescendo together stepping into the water, the drying pole position high above his head gone. Rue faced Musashi squarely align of White Foam Street to cross the surface as Musashi ran up on shore to gone, Roos left, gone root pursued Musashi's feet left the water and touch the sand at almost the same instant that gone roos sword, his whole body. Hurdled Adam like a flying fish when Musashi sense that the drying poles coming toward him. His body was still at the end of the motion that had taken him out of a water leaning slightly forward. He held the wooden sword with both hands extended out to the right behind him and partially hidden satisfied with his position. He grunted and almost noiseless sound that wafted before gone years face. The drying poll had appeared to be on the verge of a downward slice, but it wavered slightly then stopped nine feet away from Musashi. Gone route changed directions by leaping nimbly to the right. The two men stared at each other Musashi, two or three paces from the water had the c two is back gone. Rue was facing him. His sword held high with both hands. Their lives were totally absorbed in deadly combat and both were free from conscious thought.

Speaker 1:          02:53:31       The scene of battle was a perfect vacuum, but in the waiting stations and beyond the sound of the waves, countless people held their breaths above God. UNRUH hovered the prayers and the hopes of those who believed in him and wanted him to live above Musashi. The prayers in hopes of others of Sado and Iorio on the island of Ohsu and Ohsu got oh Sugi and Gono Sooki on the beach of academy and Mata Hace on their hill. All their prayers were directed to heaven. Here hopes, prayers and the gods were of no assistance nor was chance. There was only a vacuum in personal and perfectly impartial is this vacuum so difficult of achievement by one who has life the perfect expression of the mind that has risen above fought and transcended ideas. The two men spoke without speaking. Then to each came the unconscious realization of the other, the pores of their bodies stood out like needles directed at the adversary.

Speaker 4:          02:54:53       Okay,

Speaker 1:          02:54:54       muscles, flesh, nail hair. Even I browse all bodily elements that partake of life for United into a single force against the enemy, defending the living organism of which they were parked. The mind alone was one with the universe, clear and untroubled like the reflection of the moon in a pond, a midst the ratings of a typhoon to reach this sublime. A mobility is the supreme achievement. It seemed like he [inaudible] but the interval was in fact short. The time required for the waves to come in and recede a half a dozen times. Then a great shout more than vocal coming from the depths of being shattered. The instant it came from God Unruh and was followed immediately by Musashi shout. The two cries like angry waves lashing. A rocky shore sent their spirits skyward. The challenger Sword raised so high that it seemed to threaten the Sun Street through the air like a rainbow Musashi through his shoulder, his left shoulder forward Jew, his right foot back and shifted his upper body into position half facing his opponent. His wooden sword held in both hands, swept through the air at the same moment that the tip of the drying pole came down directly before his nose.

Speaker 4:          02:56:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:56:28       The breathing of the two combatants grew louder than the sound of the waves. Now the wooden sword was extended at eye level. The drying pole high above it's bearers, head gone. Rwe had bounded about 10 pieces away where you had the seed of one side. Though he had not succeeded in injuring Musashi in his first attack, he had put himself in a much better position. How did he remain where he was the s with the sun reflecting from the water into his eyes. His vision would soon have faltered than his spirit and he would have been at Musashi's mercy with renewed confidence gone. Rue began inching forward, keeping a sharp eye out for it, Chink and Musashi's defense and stealing his own spirit for a decisive move. Musashi did the unexpected.

Speaker 4:          02:57:20       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:57:20       Instead of proceeding slowly and cautiously, he strode bold boldly toward gone. Rouge has soared projecting before him ready to thrust into gone years. Eyes be artlessness of this approach. Brock gone route to a halt. He almost lost sight of Musashi, the wooden sword row straight in the air with one great kick. Musashi leapt high and folding his legs reduced his six foot frame to four feet or less.

Speaker 4:          02:57:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:57:52       Yeah. God, Woo stored. Scream through the space above him. The stroke missed, but the tip of the drying, Paul cut through Musashi's headband, which went flying through the air.

Speaker 4:          02:58:05       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:58:06       Gone Rouge mistook it for his opponents head and to smile flooded briefly across his face. The next instant his skull broke like gravel under the blow of Musashi Sword.

Speaker 4:          02:58:24       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:58:25       Has Gone Rue lay with a sand, met the grass. His face betrayed no consciousness of defeat. Bloodstream from his mouth.

Speaker 4:          02:58:36       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:58:37       but his lips form the smile of triumph. Oh No, gone through.

Speaker 4:          02:58:45       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:58:46       For getting himself. You warm a Kabuki chumped up and with him all his knew their faces distorted with shock. Then they saw the Goda Sabu and EERE sitting calmly and sedately on their benches. Shamed. They somehow managed to keep from running forward.

Speaker 4:          02:59:08       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:59:08       They tried to regain a degree of composure, but there was no concealing their grief and delusion.

Speaker 4:          02:59:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:59:15       Some swallowed hard, refusing to believe what they had seen and their mind's went blank in an instant. The island was quiet and still as it had ever been, only the rustle of the Pines and the swing grasses mocked the frailty. And the impermanence of mankind. Musashi was watching a small cloud in the sky as he did his soul return to his body and it became possible for him to distinguish between the cloud and himself between his body and the universe. Sasaki could Jiro gone. Rouge did not return to the world of the living lying face down. He still had a grip on his sword is tenacity was still visible. There was no sign of anguish on his face.

Speaker 4:          03:00:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:00:14       Nothing but satisfaction at having fought a good fight, not the faintest shadow of regret. The site of his own headband lying on the ground sent shivers up and down Musashi spine. Never in this life he thought would he meet another opponent like this? A wave of admiration and respect float over him. He was grateful to [inaudible] for what the man had given him in strength in the will to fight. He ranked higher than Musashi and it was because of this that Musashi had been forced to excel himself.

Speaker 3:          03:01:00       What was it that it enabled Musashi do to defeat? Cause she could Jiro skill, the help of the gods, while knowing it was neither of these Musashi was never able to express a reason in wards, certainly was something more important than either strength or godly. Providence Koichiro had put his confidence in the sword of strength and skill. Musashi trusted in this sort of spirit.

Speaker 4:          03:01:33       Okay.

Speaker 3:          03:01:33       That was the only difference between them silently. Musashi walked the 10 paces to Kuduro and knelt beside him. He put his left hand near the nostrils of could euro and found there was no trace of breath with the right treatment. He may recover. Musashi told himself and he wanted to believe this, wanted to believe that this Moza Vallian of all adversaries would be spared, but the battle was over.

Speaker 4:          03:02:10       Okay?

Speaker 3:          03:02:10       It was time to go farewell. He said to [inaudible] then to the officials on their beat benches, having bowed wants to the ground. He ran to the reef and jumped into the boat. There was not a drop of blood on his wooden sword. The tiny craft moved out to sea.

Speaker 4:          03:02:32       Okay.

Speaker 3:          03:02:33       Who's to say where there is no record as to whether gone rue supporters on Hiko Jima attempted to take revenge.

Speaker 4:          03:02:43       Okay.

Speaker 3:          03:02:44       People do not give up their loves and hates as long as life lasts. Waves of feeling come and go with the passage of time.

Speaker 4:          03:02:54       Okay.

Speaker 3:          03:02:55       Throughout Musashi's lifetime, there were those who resented his victory and criticized his conduct on that day. He rushed away. It was said because he feared reprisal. He was confused. He even neglected to administer the coup de Gras.

Speaker 4:          03:03:16       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          03:03:17       The world is always full of the sound of waves. The little fishes abandoning themselves to the waves, dance and sing and play. But who knows the heart of the sea a hundred feet down. Who knows? It's depth. The end. That is

Speaker 1:          03:03:58       how the book finishes up. Who knows the heart of the sea, who knows its depths. And as I read that, I wondered to myself, are we just the little fishes?

Speaker 4:          03:04:32       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:04:32       Abandoning ourselves to the waves to sing and dance and play. Is that what we're doing? And I'm not saying don't have fun. I'm not saying don't sing and dance and play. Enjoy life of course. And relish the joy of life. But I think you have to make sure you don't dance your life away.

Speaker 4:          03:05:07       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:05:08       don't be one of the little fishes. And in Docauto that final writing of Masashi before he died, the last thing he wrote,

Speaker 4:          03:05:24       okay,

Speaker 1:          03:05:24       was never stray from the way. And I think that that's what this is about. All the fun and the singing and the dancing and hold the play. It's okay, it's good. But all those things can be distractions because there is a path, there is a way, and you know what that way is, you know what you should be doing. And it's hard to stay on that path because it is the path of discipline and discomfort, but it is the right path. And did you know that? And it is that path that will ultimately lead you to where you really want to be so that you can live and you can die

Speaker 3:          03:06:58       without regrets. I think a lot of times,

Speaker 4:          03:07:07       okay,

Speaker 3:          03:07:07       people are trying to find the path and they're looking all around different places and different people in different influences. But man, I think so often that path. Do you know what the path is and people know what they're supposed to be doing, but they just don't get on the path and stay on the path.

Speaker 2:          03:07:28       Yeah, I agree. Word, something they felt when they were eight or 12, and they s they traveled the world or travel through life's experiences trying to find the answer that was in front of them the entire time. And so they come back to see what they knew with different eyes and to recognize that they knew the path all along, which is something that, uh, I so enjoyed about this book and the character both real and certainly presented by the author of Musashi who is using his experiences in this domain of the sword as a means of a thematic interconnectedness. And so unlike sus, uh, Cojito at the end, he is not just a technician with the sword, although he is a brilliant technician. He's tilling the soil, he's constructing buildings, which later he did quite a lot of, uh, in terms of architecture and overseeing the building instead of destruction of things and finding at the highest levels of performance with the sword in felling opponents, the, the principles, the first principles that he can apply everywhere. And that's part of what fascinates me so much about Musashi or anyone who's the best at what they do is that it could be anything. It could be pottery, it could be sniping, it could be calligraphy, but like the best they see the depth, they see the, uh,

Speaker 4:          03:09:13       yeah,

Speaker 2:          03:09:13       the interwoven web is that can expand from that one fine focus into everything that they do. And I think of that for me at least is the path, and maybe it's just coming off of a silent retreat that I want to talk this way, but it doesn't strike me as something that is cleanly expressed in an Instagram post or a quote necessarily. It's more of a feeling like, you know,

Speaker 4:          03:09:41       okay,

Speaker 2:          03:09:42       if you're sober and take a moment to sit in the stillness and that stillness, I don't mean sitting on a mountain top, it could just be five minutes of silence. You first get up in the morning and observe your own mind and how you feel like you know if you're on the path or not. Or at least you know when you're not totally agree. You know, you know when you're not on it. And I think that the feeling of being on it when you're on the path, it has that beauty of mindlessness or no mind is what they would say in say zen. The state of no mind, and it sounds like unconscious, but it's different. It's not unconscious, it's not subconscious. It's something else where you feel that you are exactly where you should be doing exactly what you should be doing and you're not planning, you're just putting one foot in front of the other on this path that you didn't have to find it because in a way the path was seeking you the whole time.

Speaker 2:          03:10:49       And it's just a feeling. It's a really, it's a feeling I think that everyone can have, but they get so caught up, we all get caught up. I don't want to speak for you to find, so I'll speak for myself. It's, it's easy to get caught up in the noise, in the shiny objects and just like the little fish you were talking about earlier, it's like what you see that lure to recognize it as a lure is sort of the first step. And then to realize that when you look past the lure, all right, there's a lure 16 inches in front of you and then you're in an ocean that has endless fathoms of death.

Speaker 1:          03:11:32       What a journey. Yeah. I the same, the line that says the world is always filled with the sound of waves. It's like, yeah, those sounds are going on and the waves are out there and there's little fishies swimming around in the waves.

Speaker 2:          03:11:49       You, and I think you've experienced this type of, that type of clarity in many different contexts. Uh, I haven't surfed much, but I have done a bit, certainly not as regularly as you have, but the feeling of when I've been out in surf that suddenly exceeded my capacities, which is also not necessarily something I recommend, but I've had this harrowing experience, particularly as someone who didn't learn to swim until I was in my thirties which is a whole separate thing that I think we covered in episode 50. I have fear related to the ocean, which I think is healthy on, on a lot of levels. When you're out there and suddenly sets come in that are 70% of 102% bigger than what you went in with the feeling of, or just sitting calmly on your board waiting for a set and looking out over the water. The sense of insignificance that you feel is not a, at least that I feel. It's not a negative thing. It's a very, uh,

Speaker 2:          03:13:01       hesitate to use the word, but I can't find a better one spiritual experience where you're like, oh yeah, that email, that comment on social media, that commitment I made to go to an event that I run now really six months later, don't want to go to who gives a fuck? It's like we're a bunch of monkeys on a spinning rock in the middle of this whole thing. Whatever this whole thing is. And all that thing is singing and dancing and playing it. It's like compared to the depths of the ocean, it means nothing. Yeah. I think, yeah, it's, it's, uh,

Speaker 4:          03:13:35       it's,

Speaker 2:          03:13:39       I just, I love the purity of, uh, despite his stupidity, let's be honest. Right? We already talked about it. Like, he made us a lot of stupid decisions. Storming the jail. I mean, what do you, what do you think's going to happen? And so on and so forth. Despite all that, coming back to what he knew, one of the few things that he felt, I shouldn't say no, felt to be true to him, which was this commitment to the way of the sword. And it doesn't have to be a commitment to the way of the sword, but I've always had a certain envy, uh, for people including yourself, who from a very, very early age just felt

Speaker 4:          03:14:21       okay.

Speaker 2:          03:14:21       Ebay beacon for a direction that called them. Yeah, really lucky. I feel like I was really lucky in that aspect where you meet people. I've met for instance, Laird Hamilton, I mentioned him earlier. He's like, he still surfs every day, wakes up at four, stoked to go out and train and uh, he's on the path. He's on the path and I mean this is a guy

Speaker 4:          03:14:47       who

Speaker 2:          03:14:49       he was with, I mean he's out there with large tiger sharks, which are routinely out where he surfs in Hawaii, where he spends a good portion of the year and I've heard stories and these are real, these are not several hundred years later. And Baelish storage is a real stories where someone was bitten by a tiger shark bleeding out. He went back to a jet ski, they had a, Oh, it took off at some piece of clothing. He had put in makeshift tourniquet on this guy who's bleeding in the water with tiger sharks. Keep, mine's already been bitten. The key has been lost to the jet ski hot wires, the Jet Ski and brings the Guy Back and saves them and, and I'd say every few months he saved someone's life in the water and he's in his 50s and you're sitting in a, in a steam room at one point. And uh, I, I, I in retrospect realized not a good idea to try to outlast layered and the steam room, but he was saying roughly along these lines, like 20

Speaker 1:          03:15:50       once it's 20 feet, you can start to have fun. Start to play around. He goes 20 to 20 to 30. Yeah, you're really jamming. It's like 30 to 40 you can definitely get into the zone and he's like above 50 are not allowed to fall. And that's his day and he has kids. But as far as I can tell, Gabby, who's just incredible, incredible on so many levels in her own right, she understands like this is his path. He's still chasing giants and he's not going to stop. How could he, like that's part of who he is. What do you think draws people like in the wrong direction in their life? I think it's just a little distractions as you talk about. It's a little distractions, little things that just pull you off. And I think, I think maybe people don't want to accept the fact like they know what the path is, but they want to deny it for what?

Speaker 1:          03:16:48       For whatever reason. Like I think that's, I think that can be part of it. Uh, the, the distraction of the path. I mean, I will say for those people out there who were like, oh, for God's sake, like I don't know what my path is. I can't define it. I don't know if I could, if I could say to someone with absolute conviction, my path is x, but I can tell when I've strayed, if that makes sense. There's a certain agitation, there's a certain scattered feeling that I have and as to reasons people get off the path. And I think people may have multiple paths, but you are going to say, I was going to say, because I've been, I'm trying to formulate what what we're talking about because I know exactly what you mean. Like like the path is, it might not be like, Hey I want to do this thing.

Speaker 1:          03:17:44       Like there's something else and, and I think it, I think there's something else is the path is how you are going to live. Yeah. That's not necessarily a destination that you could, you could follow the same path and get to a bunch of different destinations, but the path itself of how you're going to live, how you're going to go through life, how you're going to do things, that's, that's what I'm talking about. And even the path that I'm on could have led to other things and in my life and even though you know, I was in the military for 20 years, I'm not in the military anymore, I'm still on the same path. Like the path is the same of the way I'm trying to live my life. That's the same. And if I'm in, when I'm in business, the way I, the way I run my business, I'm Trump. I'm just on the same path. It's the path. It's like the way you're living your life more than anything else. And it doesn't matter if you're in college, if you're starting a business, if you're working for someone, are you on the path that you're supposed to be on? Are you living the way that

Speaker 3:          03:18:48       you feel you're supposed to live, that you know you're supposed to live? I think people get off that. They get off that and then not living the way that they know they should live, regardless of circumstances. You've been in horrible circumstances before we all, we all go in situations where things just went sideways and, and you can either have stray off the path and turn into something that you're not, or something that you know you shouldn't be or you can stay on the path. You can continue to do the things that you're supposed to do and do and live the way that you want to live. And really lately I've been talking about, because I've been trying to explain this, you know what the right thing to do is, right? You know what you're supposed to do as a person, as you, you know what you're supposed to do.

Speaker 3:          03:19:33       Do it, do that thing. What is that thing that you spent? You know, you're supposed to live a certain way. And, and when you don't live that way, like you said, there's, there's friction and there's tension and there's disruption and it doesn't feel right. And when you live the right way, it's often harder. It often is less immediate gratification, but the, but the internal gratification that you get from living the way you're supposed to live is very satisfying. And another thing I need to absolutely point out is I am by no means sitting here trying to say that I've always maintained the worst human ever. I'm horrible. And, and you know, I was on with a, with a guy named Charlie plumb came on the podcast and a guy named Jim Jim Conkle. Charlie plumb was a Vietnam, uh, fighter pilot shot down, spent six years in the Hanoi Hilton.

Speaker 3:          03:20:27       And another guy named Jim [inaudible] uncle who was a fighter pilot in World War II. And, and we got in this conversation like about, you know, doing good and, and these guys are just levels, infinite levels above me as far as being good people. And, and I kind of went along with the conversation almost as if I was one of their like had that level of goodness, which I don't, you know, I mean I'm trying, but you know, when I was a young seal has a maniac, you know, I made Musashi looked like a brilliant saint when his youth, you know, I was like, how are easy maniac kid filled with just mayhem in my brain and, and all my friends, we were all the same and we got after it. And so believe me, I'm not trying to say that, but I will say that as I've grown up, I've, I've think I've gotten myself closer to living the way that I know I'm supposed to live or I the what I believe to be the right way and the right path to be on. And you know, so I just wanted to make that quick caveat that anybody that's listening that's like, Oh wow, jack was really just a saintly person. Go wrong. I'm not even remotely making that claim. Um, but I am trying, I'll give myself at least that much credit. I think that everyone is a work in progress and

Speaker 2:          03:21:46       the path so to speak is

Speaker 4:          03:21:50       okay

Speaker 2:          03:21:51       illustrated for me in this book and I'll, I'll get into a couple of specifics. It might be helpful for people to think about or at least had been helpful to me as I think through what distinguishes the relative lack of friction and the scatteredness and agitation versus states without those things. Because being on the path is not necessarily for me a feeling of overwhelming joy and happiness per se. It's, it's a lack of

Speaker 2:          03:22:29       excess agitation and distractedness and I think that what, what I've found for myself is that as I get older and feel more at peace with what I'm doing and how I'm behaving, like you said, it's, it's having certain first principles in mind that transcend any given project, any given conversation, anyone relationship. And early on, it's as you're hoping to define yourself or find yourself or build yourself, you all, he very often succumb because how could you not to pursuing shiny object after shiny object? And in the beginning I think that's fine. And even for a very long period of time, you throw a lot against the wall to see what sticks and to discover what you're good at, what you're terrible at, where your weaknesses are, what your strengths are. But over time, whether you're looking at some of the most successful investors in the world, like Ray Dalio of Bridgewater associates, they manage $160 billion at last count.

Speaker 2:          03:23:30       And uh, or athletes like Marcello Garcia who will not train a technique that he cannot use on a 300 pound muscular opponent. He just will not train. The ITI did not. He does not drill techniques that he cannot apply to someone twice its size. And these are principles, right? Whether it's safe and it, and you can take principles from one domain and transplant them, which is why I think this book is such an excellent illustration of the value of becoming exceptionally, exceptionally good at something in a very, very narrow band. Because when you do that, the constitution and the frameworks and the principles that you developed for yourself can then be applied everywhere. So in Jujitsu, let's just say, and I'm talking out my ass a little bit since, I certainly don't feel qualified to speak to too much on Jujitsu at this table, but if you take something like position before submission, right?

Speaker 2:          03:24:32       Let's just say for what, for whatever reason you adopt that and that's worked very well for you. You can apply that to a lot, right? You can apply that to a lot of things. And uh, when you start to really think about precepts and principles and the Docauto that last a short book or treatise of Musashi is, is in a fact, uh, a bulleted list of precepts and pretty tough to follow all of them, all of them at the same time. By the way if you read them, but if you just have a few, I ended a, they can be very plain, very much plain speech. I mean let's just say it's say what you mean mean mean what you say do what you say you are going to do on time. I mean very simple, right? Then you have a recipe book, you have an algorithm which is really just a step, a set of steps that produce a given no and predetermined outcome. Usually if you follow those you, you can start to mold and define this path, your way of moving through the world and interacting with the world, but if you're stuck in say

Speaker 2:          03:25:49       the weather patterns of the world instead of looking at sort of the tectonic plate level and you're focused on these things, it change very, very quickly like the news cycle, like what your friends are saying on social media at all times. The fear of missing out in social expectations that are set, that make you want to posture because all of your friends are putting highlights of their lives on the Internet, which makes you feel like a failure because it's not all glamour shots. Those are all just shifting weather patterns. They mean nothing and you just, you should let those pass as they say in this book, it comes up a lot. Uh, as much as froth froth that comes up a lot in Musashi and flies, right? Froth and flies and insects. He's passing phenomena versus thinking about, in his case he uses the mountains and so on, but the lower levels that tend to be less, they're less sexy, they don't move as quickly.

Speaker 2:          03:26:54       Uh, but if you understand those slower moving and by extensions a timeless principles and you can use those to carve and form and find, rediscovered your own path than I think it just gives you a much greater level of peace in part because it gives you a much greater level of agency. You feel like you can craft your experience of life as opposed to being tossed back and forth by the vagaries of fast changing factors you have no control over man. Well I suppose we could talk about this, um, indefinitely, but we're using up too

Speaker 7:          03:27:42       much bandwidth already. Um, Echo. Speaking of the path, do you have any recommendations of maybe how people could stay on the path and, and, and, you know, maybe even support? Sure. Real quick though, as far as pronunciation goes, when there's like a double consonant, you kind of say I'm both. Huh? Like, like this Dakota, you say dope. Cotto yeah, there's a little stutter in it. Cause it's almost like you got to finish the first K and then start the second kid. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's, yeah, it's kind of a, I think it would be considered what they call it. Glottal stops. So like Hokkaido in Japan is actually Ho guy though. Right? Right. But if there was only one kid be Hokkaido. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. We're, school took me a long time, which was really embarrassing in the beginning, working on my pronunciation.

Speaker 7:          03:28:34       Uh, I had to say the word school a lot. I was going to school, walking to school. When are you going to school and its goal, which has that little stutter and man, did I mess that up? Well, I certainly uh, cast a broad apology to all of my Japanese friends especially, they're going to be going crazy. I'm sorry. It's interesting that you care because in, in, in the Hawaiian language they put a, it's actually considered another letter. It's, it's called the Oak Kenai. It's basically an apostrophe. In Hawaii there's a lot of vowels go together, right? So when you want, when you want to do that little function to separate them, you put the Oak Ina, they're like, like the word Hawaii, Hawaii. There's two eyes at the end. So you say Hawaii, you remember you were asking me, Oh, I just say call. How do you say quiets it quiet? [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          03:29:24       I think technically it's cool. I typically don't say cola anymore. That's a whole nother theory. Very similar but similar deal, right? Similar deal. Like, this is with consonant, straight A, and I don't want to take us too far afield, but you, there are some really weird similarities between Japanese and other languages where there may have been trade roots established before the dawn of man in weird places. Uh, so there are some commonalities in Polynesian languages and then you also find incredible commonalities with Turkish of all languages. Yeah. Nearly identical grammar. I remember when I was taking linguistic classes and their, what they would point out these weird, weird commonalities that you say, wow, that's, you know, like things that like the number one things like the sun, things that it, you know, everyone kind of has to have created a word for it some point. The other is definitely some strings and I forget what they are. I didn't study hard enough. I wasn't on the path fit and closely enough. But a lot of these languages like that, you know, even the pronunciation of like a is Ah, you know, Japanese Hawaiian, yeah. You know, all these very soft bowels. Typically.

Speaker 2:          03:30:39       Yeah. Uh, a e O Ooh. Yeah. And then that I is like e yeah. Japanese people can handle Spanish is probably the closest that I've seen language that they can handle. Any language that ends on consonants, a lot is going to be so right. I remember. They've such tough time. They add the you at the end. Yeah. The teams and Tim, Tim or Jeff, the same mcbeaty or yeah, be it a nub. I beat her. Mcdonald's is Monica Donato. Yay. And then they have a tough time. Uh, but the, and the, for those people wondering, the reason they can't or have so much trouble distinguishing between r's and L's, which many other Asian people do not. But in the case of Japanese is because they have a blended phoneme of blended sound. It's a, it's a combination of our l and d. So naughty you dude.

Speaker 2:          03:31:30       It is how they say it. So that do that like sound is not clearly distinguished into multiple consonants in Japanese, which is why they have so much trouble with r's and L's. But you can teach them to fix that in a few minutes. If you explain how the tongue is positioned. And I remember at one point I give credit to my first Japanese teacher, Mr Shimano, who was fantastic because we would hit a sticking point in class, we'd be going over some concept that was really difficult for a native English speaker, his brain to wrap itself around, like they have subject markers and the difference between why God and if it's known to the speaker, it's this, if they're not known to the speaker, it's that. And you're like, what's like, what does that even mean? And he could sense because, uh, I, I transferred from a very weak school, very bad school on long island to a very highly competitive school in New Hampshire that had classes six days a week, mandatory seated meal, like dead Poets Society, Mandatory Sports classes from 8:00 AM or so to about 6:00 PM and the Japanese class was very often the class after sports.

Speaker 2:          03:32:40       So people were wiped out, hadn't had dinner, and we'd be struggling in getting agitated with some aspect of Japanese and he could tell that we were, we were, we were losing it, but we still had 45 minutes to go. So it's all right. Had a really strong Japanese accent and he'd be like, we're gonna stop for a minute and I'm going to attempt to say this word for you. And you would write squirrel on the blackboard if you want to talk about a word that would be designed to be Kryptonite for Japanese person. And so he would, he would take like five minutes for just comedic effect to just go scar scorer, screw. I need to do that for like two minutes and we crack up and loosen up and realize, okay, everyone is learning a new language, has some type of sticking point like this. And then he'd be like, okay, enough fun and games. Now back to the hard stuff. He's an excellent, excellent teacher. Yeah, it's legit. Speaking of hard

Speaker 7:          03:33:38       stuff, speak quick, my brother please for the love of God all good. I was going to talk more about your retreat, but we can talk about that later. In the meantime, wouldn't take care of her joints or gin. main.com is a good spot to get these joint supplements. Chaco supplements, Super Krill Oil, not just regular Krill oil. Supercar Krill oil. Yeah, clearly. All upstairs actually. Boom. There you go. Also another one called Jocko joint warfare. It's a blend of joint degeneration, warfare, weapons check technically also for some legit fitness gear. If you're in the kettle, you into kettlebells. Yeah, I have some in my, uh, my garage here. It's the only, the only fitness tools I have right now are two kilovolts. Boom. There you go. So boom, I got mine from on it. Yeah. Squat rack. I go to a gym for that right now, but yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 7:          03:34:33       I'll get, I'll get kettlebells are dope. Yeah. Especially the ones from audit, by the way. Werewolf gorilla, bigfoot chimp. I'm just listing the ones. Oh, I thought you were calling me names. The thing you're trying out new names for me. Those are the kettle kettlebells I have, you know, the autistic one, the dope months. Did you say artistic or autistic artists? I'm just curious. Just messing with and I don't think they're up to stick at all, but they are dope though. My opinion, you're the regular ones. I have the ISO. We're, we're sitting here in Austin, Texas. Not too far from Vaughn at HQ and I actually bought two of the standard issue. I know you're like me. Yeah. Just cut, not cut the decorations and just go. I click got training in star wars ones though. They do. Yeah, the Darth Vader one and storm trooper. The Darth Vader once. Cool.

Speaker 7:          03:35:25       Yeah, I've seen it. You got to kind of admit it after awhile. You're like, okay, I mean me, I don't care. I'm like, Hey, come to my house. See my kettle bells. Yeah, they're dope. But some people Jocko, they're like, no, you know, wants to say hardcore, but you got to admit it. I'm more of a Boba Fett guy myself. But yeah, I do like Darth Vader. Yeah, check those out anyway on it.com Mecca. And they got other stuff on there too. Um, pretty much for any kind of workout other than what, like your typical gym workout, like they have maces and whatnot. So anyway, go down on it. Yeah. And just as a side note for people listening, don't, alright. I've had enough caffeine. I've been off of caffeine for 10 days. So we do a lot of personality right now. Uh, all good. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good when it comes to working out or home gyms or anything like that.

Speaker 7:          03:36:14       Don't say I can't start because I don't have these seven pieces of equipment for two years when I had very little money and was training in Jujitsu when I just moved to the bay area, which is stupidly expensive. I had roommates and no space whatsoever. I had one 53 pound kettle bell and I did everything with that kettle I did and I got into that combined with Jujitsu, that's all I had space for. It was one kettle bell. I got into some of the best shape of my entire life. Yeah. You're like kettled off 53 pounds. That's nothing. It's like, okay, do 20 pistols with 50 pounder. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see if you can do one review the three pounds. Cause a lot of people couldn't even do one pistol with a 53 pound kettlebell. Yeah. That's like the goal. Yeah. Yeah. And I'll say, I don't want to say I was against kettlebells before, but you know when they first kind of came on the scene here.

Speaker 7:          03:37:06       Yeah. And then people were like, yeah, kettlebells and look how cool we are. You know how like when people do that, you kind of build this kind of natural, not resentment, but just some resistance. Like, I'm not going to jump on your little band. Like I see what you're doing, you know, I'm a stick to this. Or, and then finally I got on the boat and kind of shit it got on that earlier man. Kettlebells and you don't need to be, I will say not a doctor, don't play one on the Internet, but just to uh, to keep Jockos liability insurance premiums, low kettlebells. Don't get too fancy. Kids with the kettle bells. Don't pick up a kettle ball for the first time and tried to do snatches. Yeah, it's a good way to, uh, get reconstructive shoulder surgery. You don't need to do a whole lot if you just do two handed Kettlebell swings properly, which I would not in my book would not be above the shoulder.

Speaker 7:          03:37:57       And you do, let's just say some Turkish getups, even partial Turkish getups and a handful of other exercises. I'm particular wind mills in caustic squads and so on. You really don't need much and you, you don't have to do potentially dangerous ballistic movements to get a lot out of kettlebells. Yeah. And I personally would even go further and say don't do much like especially like the like Turkish get the snatch too. Like these ones where snatch beautiful color. Yeah. If you're trying to like, let me get that big one. Cause it's cool. You look at them and this one's like obviously bigger than the other. I'm going to get down mean the last time you were at my house, I was over there dude. Every exercise with the biggest kettlebells I asked me. Yeah. So I dig it man. But man, if you start doing these snatches or the man, I had to have this big foot one, it's 90 pounds and me.

Speaker 7:          03:38:49       So I can, I mean now I can boom, clean, impressed one hand I'll go like, oh, go to this side to this, that in to this, you know, I'll do that. And it wasn't like, I don't know if I wasn't warm or I just hit it at the wrong angle. I got it up to here and then when I pressed it up, I think he was too far back. So it went like when I press it was weird. You know, kettle bells are they big tank back there. So when I pressed it up it's almost like it went backwards. Messed up my shoulder a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. You will be able to press as well as you can clean. So if you cannot clean a weight extremely smoothly to your side, do not try to press it. Yeah. It had been, just be careful. Start Light. That's the point, right?

Speaker 2:          03:39:34       Yeah. Unless you're Jocko, I'm not saying anything over here because of liability. I know I give the worst advice on this kind of stuff, so sometimes yes, for sure. Also if you don't have a copy of Musashi, yeah, I'm going to list it on the website, a Goto Jocko podcast.com. Go to the books section right there on the top menu. Boom. Click on there. It will be actually, it's been on there. It's been on there since you mentioned it. It's been on there for a year. Yeah, I'll put it right at the top. Don't even have to scroll down. Boom. Click on it. It is good. I had another book to the page or Cortland thousand percent. That's a lot of percent. I'm on it. Uh, so I have a brand new book that is out, which Jocko is a part of as a, as a continuation of our lifelong partnership.

Speaker 2:          03:40:33       Jocko has a reappearance in tribe of mentors, which is I think the easiest to read book that I have yet put together. It is a brand spanking new who has 130 people all asked the same 11 questions that were most burning for me. And uh, is that a thousand page book because it's this thick. It's shorter than Musashi, which isn't saying much. It is a about 650 pages. Each profile is ranges between two in 10 pages and a number of the people who came up in our conversation, like Dan Gable who won a gold medal in the Olympics for wrestling without having a single point scored on him. Ridiculous. It's like winning Wimbledon and that having a point scored on. Yeah, it doesn't happen. People, uh, and many, many, many others. So it covers every possible facet of human performance, whether it's a physical training, uh, expert meditators, worldclass investors, the founders of Facebook, Twitter, salesforce, linkedin, you name it.

Speaker 2:          03:41:39       If you want super, super tactical and nuggets of advice, including some from our good friend Jocko Willink, then Sharben mentors is a easy to digest. Choose your own adventure book. That would be a nice nonfiction compliment to our friend Musashi. Yeah, I'm put it up there right next to it. Boom. And so what that does is you click on, it takes you through to Amazon. Boom. What was the, what was the website again for your book page? Jocko, podcast.com. I think it might be slash books maybe, but easiest way, you know the top menu on the website, but it just, it looks from the pot, from episodes, whatever I am. Yeah. Click on there, boom. Click through there. And if you're doing any other Amazon shopping, you know, hey, carry on. No one's going to stop you there. Also subscribe to the podcast. I was just going to say, they may have already removed this, a little glitch in

Speaker 7:          03:42:32       the system, but I used to be able to buy trap bars and so on, on Amazon prime with no shipping trap bars. So hex bar. Oh right, right. It's like a hug, like 60 pounds to a hundred pounds of metal. Uh, so while you're picking up your brain food, you can pick up your body tools. Boom. Eventually dig it. Amazon. Yeah, Amazon is pretty good with their shipping situation. I gotta tell you, even if the, you want it, like whatever the next day, you know, we were like good additional shipping. It's like four bucks or something. Oh, it's amazing. Yeah. He got something right on that one. You know, I also subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already on iTunes and stitcher and Google play and Spotify. I think, I think real confident that whatever you're listening to, the podcast on, boom, subscribe. Also on Youtube. If you haven't already, there's more than just the podcast I needed to. It's excerpts on Youtube. What are you going to put some, some takeaways or what did they call it? Outtakes from this because there were some pretty funny ones.

Speaker 7:          03:43:41       They were, but we were all laughing. I think so. In fact, yes, that's exactly what I'm going to do, which is one of the many reasons to subscribe to the Youtube Channel, in my opinion. What is the Youtube Channel? Jocko podcasts do your big role, the ubiquitous, so make sure we spell it out. I'm so bad at this. I'm just the hand wavy PT Barnum guy gets technically were true. When we say subscribe to the podcast, technically we are asking them to go on Youtube, search for Jocko podcast. Make sure it's the correct one. You know, sometimes there'll be like jock, go see Tim adding tons of, yeah, you could just get, you could get, and, uh, since this will not be published for probably a few hours, at least you guys could get a URL like Jocko subscribed.com and then have it point to a page on your website where you have all of the links where people can click for different services to subscribe.

Speaker 7:          03:44:38       Man, I wish I had somebody that worked with me that like did computer type stuff and stuff like that because maybe they would have done that at the beginning when we first started this stuff like that. I was thinking of all of these things. This is what I'm going to buy Jocko, podcasts, this and all this. Then we can have them all and we'll, I'll do this stuff. And then, um, like your whole attitude. You didn't tell me not to do it. I'm not blaming this on you. I'm just saying that that's what I was real fired up to do. But he's like, no man, that's it. Jocko store. That's it. You know, like super simple. So I'm like, Oh yeah, that's, that's cool right there. So like all the cool little thing. I will, I'll, I'll, I will jockos defense, you know, say I see tears welling up in the eyes. Uh, in Giagos defense, I will say that a lot of people who try to start podcasts or do x get caught with the obsession on new tactics. And then above tactics you would have strategy and the most strategy would have principles. And so if, if you're constantly focused on optimizing for an additional 1% with these tools, you get nowhere. On the other hand, if I would say, like you guys have done with this podcast to focus on

Speaker 7:          03:45:57       exceptionally high quality, that fixes a lot of problems. And then other people use tactics on your behalf and you don't have to be as concerned with the ebb and flow and expiration dates of said tools. So there's always a good time. Always a market uncrowded market is great. That's the only uncredited market. Dang. See. And just to be clear, when you were like that, it wasn't that you were like influencing me not to do it. You just like the way you were was cool to me. I was like, Dang, that's cool. So I'm going to just keep it super simple to me. Just kind of trying to be like you. But yeah, I thought of that same thing. I'm going to have the thing and it'll have all the links. Aw Man. That'll be great. Then meanwhile he's like, let's record a podcast, so, okay, let's do that. You know, so we let that other stuff go. Anyway, Youtube, back to youtube, Jocko podcast, regular logo, black white letters. Boom. That's it. That's the one that you want to subscribe to. Also, Jack was the store. It's called chocolate store and I see that. No bells, no whistles. Jocko, store.com t shirts, travel mugs, bumper stickers, all that stuff. Some rash guards, new rash guards,

Speaker 7:          03:47:19       hoodies, picker, hoodies. I got people sending Marines, thermometers, Nebraska actually. Yeah, someone did that to me too. What about your, uh, your crop tops with the discipline equals love on them for those out of stock still. Those are out of stock broker actually, but the women's stuff is back in stock as well. That was out for awhile. Luke girls, you know for the girls, for the ladies, boom, back in the game, big time. Some patches in there. And again, the rash guards where your kid, I think that's the one. Yeah, actually there's another one. Yeah, you or got them around. Any question about rash guards? I always assumed because I had never seen rash guards until a few years into the Jujitsu game, I guess or observing that I assumed that rash guards became part of Jujitsu because Brazilians also surf a lot and would then just use them in the gym.

Speaker 7:          03:48:24       What is the function of the rash guard? I've never understood that. I knew that because let's say versus wearing a tight fitting like sweat wicking shirt. Well, I mean it's not going to be as tight fitting as a rash guard is, right? A rash guard is as tight Vinnie's, uh, piece of garment can be and therefore your fingers won't get caught in it. Your toes won't get caught in it, it won't get in the way. And that's, that's why now you can also just go shirtless, but when you go shirtless, now you've got ringworm and, and all whatever other heinous forms, diseases that live on the mat. And so that's, and it's just Kinda, you know, it just takes it one, one separation away from pure nastiness when you're rolling with everyone. But you guys should make, maybe I'm the only one with this issue, but I always find, I feel constricted at the neck and the hot in certain rash guards so that all rash guards, but if there were one that gave some space to the neck, that would be, yeah, I think some brands will have a wider neck, wider know some brands will actually on purpose have like a higher neck.

Speaker 7:          03:49:27       Right. Some people want full coverage in the gym. They want, they don't want to make human contact with anyone. It's just the Spiderman outfit while they're trying to throw it out. There's people that were in a little hoods, I'm not kidding. So yeah, it's getting crazy. People with like hair or something like that, they'll do that hood thing. That's cool. But I can get you, I can give you whatever kind of Roger you want to loose neck, rash, guard. I'll get your loose. Recommend that rash guard. No one piece. Say Discipline Equals love. If you could get me a discipline equals love. UNITARDS for my reentry to the Jujitsu world, that'll go over good. Just before I tapped at t Ferris out, I commented on his garment, but yeah. Hey Jocko, store.com that's where you get them. They're cool. Also psychological warfare, if you didn't know what that is, it's an album with tracks.

Speaker 7:          03:50:22       Tim Ferris that if you're on the path Foley, but you find those days or those moments, whatever, that maybe you might want to get this store. You feel like you're going to choose to step off the path. That's what it's for really. It's not like when you suddenly get distracted, it's like I'm going to wake up at what? Five and um, just to, to, I'm not going to wake up at five. I'm gonna Sleep in. He listened to one of these tracks. This specified tracked though. Wake up and get a, what's it called? Wake up and get her fruit wake up. You can get after it. What it is is you play it and it's Jocko telling you why you should wake up and get after it pragmatically in his own Jocko away. But there's, there's tracks for everything. No waking up, slipping on the diets, skipping the workout, blah, blah, blah. All that stuff. No, let me interject here or actually take over if you don't mind please. Because the psychological warfare, tra, uh, album on iTunes was a number one spoken word album for about, I think nine months straight. And unfortunately, good

Speaker 3:          03:51:26       news and bad news, it was just taken down for I, we just got beat out as the number one album. There's now a new number one album. Giraffes can't dance is not, you're asking the new number one album on iTunes spoken word is discipline equals freedom field manual. Now it was number one. Did you share that? I get the report every day. So if you've been looking for discipline equals freedom field manual in audio form yet formula, it's not on audible because then you couldn't put it in your alarm. You couldn't listen to tracks whenever you want it to. That's why we didn't do it that way. We put it is an as an album with tracks on Amazon music, Google play, Spotify apart everywhere. I think you can ask Alexa, she'll deliver it. Alexa, like boom, you're there. Uh, so that's out. Also on Amazon Jocko white tea.

Speaker 3:          03:52:15       Most people think it's the best tea that they've ever had and it's guaranteed, um, and scientifically proven to increase your deadlift to a minimum of 8,000 pounds. We have all backed up data on that. A little blind, double blind, Quik trip, quadruple blind other books to get on Amazon and we might as well just put all these books on our website. Uh, so first Tim, Tim, obviously four hour workweek, four hour chef, four hour body tools of titans. Those are all books, awesome books. And I was thinking about four hour work week and what I was thinking about for our work week that I think when I read it for the first time, which was before I knew you what it did, I didn't follow anything in your book for our work week. I didn't, I don't even follow one thing. Maybe May, I dunno, maybe there's two or three things in there.

Speaker 3:          03:53:07       What it did though is it made me look at things in a different way cause you were saying, look, here's this and you looked at it from over here. And what it showed me was like I can look at things differently and you know, like I said, I probably grabbed a couple things from there. But the most important thing that it gave me was like, okay, you don't have to look at this the way everyone else is looking at it and that's the, that's the best damn drill you can get from somebody or the best advice you can get somebody who's like don't look at things the same way. Everyone else. There's a whole nother angle. And once I saw what angle you were looking at it from, I looked at, I started saying, well let's look at it from my ankle. What does this going to look like from over here?

Speaker 3:          03:53:46       So that's a great book. And again, the four hour chef, which is, it's about cooking, but it's really about learning. It's really about learning for our body. All kinds of good experiments that you did on yourself. You're similar to me in the fact that I'm always chasing some different goal. I'm either trying to do Max pull ups or I'm trying to do a Max deadlift for, I'm trying to cut down my one mile run time. I'm always got some random thing that I'm trying to do. And I, and, and I explained this, I'm actually, I actually explained it when I was just on your podcast. I, if I'm not going to get to a 600 pound dead lift because my whole life would have to be different and I wouldn't be able to do other things that I to do. So I get to an 80% or an 85% of what I'm actually humanly capable of.

Speaker 3:          03:54:28       And then I'm looking for that next goal because I'm not going to change my entire life. Uh, but what, what the, what the four hour body is good for is you've got a lot of different things that you can bounce from thing to thing and they're all going to improve some aspect. So I thought that was awesome. Tools of titans, obviously tons of of good information from all a lot of different people and, and now you've got tribal mentors and it's interesting because you know when we talk about for 20 minutes or however long we were talking about the path for, well for people out there that are saying like, well what, what path? And I'm sitting here trying to explain it, it's hard. I don't think I did a good job. I took a swing at it. But what's cool is you get a book like tribe of mentors and you can kind of get a feel for what other people's paths are and how they stay on them and way they live their lives. And then you can at least at a minimum get a different perspective from different people, which just like four hour work week for me is very important to see different people's angles on the way they look at things. It's, it's like it's an eye opener at a minimum. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          03:55:31       the Lens. I mean, if you, if you have a set of different lenses that you can look through to evaluate the world and make decisions, evaluate yourself and make different decisions, it's, it can really change your life and the lives of those around you very, very quickly. Uh, what's, what's been fun about putting together in this case, tribe of mentors is that I'm asking people the same 11 questions. So for instance, I might ask, what do you do or what do you tell yourself when you feel overwhelmed or get distracted? As we were talking about staying on the path, and I asked I, that was one of the questions that I sent to everyone and people were able to pick and choose their questions. But when you see that across disciplines, and so you have everyone from say David Lynch, where Darren Aronofsky, who were incredible directors to the Dan Gables, the, uh, Kelly Slater's most decorated surfer of all time, uh, to artists and investors and so on.

Speaker 2:          03:56:36       There are commonalities so you can spot patterns and then assemble your own toolkit of these first principles we've been talking about. So, for instance, one that I've been applying, there are many that I've been applying myself from the book. Uh, you may have met Kyle Maynard before. I know who he is, said I have better. We have. So Kyle, incredible guy, uh, congenital quad amputee, that means he was born without arms or legs, became a wrestler. I mean, among many other things. I mean, became a wrestler, lost every match is for a season in his, uh, his dad supported him throughout it all. They were accused of child abuse. He kept competing and then he started winning. And the same people who said it was child abuse were like, oh, he isn't. Now. He has an unfair advantage. Just people can't grab his arms and legs.

Speaker 2:          03:57:22       I was like, really? Wow. What a world. And uh, just a fascinating guy who has done a lot, climbed Kilimanjaro. I think he was the first person ever to do so. A quad amputee without prosthetics carried the ashes of a, uh, a fallen, a member of our military to the top, which was there one of their dying wishes. And he gave a piece of advice that he learned from a business icon, which was you can't answer seven and what that refers to is any time you are rating for yourself, say how important something is or how much you want to do something on a scale of zero to 10 you can't use seven. If you're asking someone for feedback, they can't use seven. Why? Because all of a sudden now they can't choose. What I realized after reading it and is a safe, comfortable, nebulous number, and that's always seven.

Speaker 2:          03:58:20       Now you have to choose a six which is barely better than 50% or an eight and you, you get to, you accelerate your path to better decisions almost immediately just by adopting that or the way that, say Daniel Negreanu, fader Holtz. These are two of the biggest winning poker players of all time. One in live, in person tournaments, the other online, and to look at their decision frameworks, how they decide, how much to bet, how they stake other people. These are all tools that you can apply everywhere. It's really cool stuff. Uh, so yeah, travel mentors has been a very, very fun book to put together.

Speaker 3:          03:59:01       Yeah, it's a, I've been on the road, but one of your people sent it to me, so I think it's waiting for me at my house when I get back. So I'm stoked on that one. And what you showed me that flip through, that's kind of why I know it's, I'm going to be cool for people to get again, find, find, find the path, find various paths and, and help them, guide them towards, there's also run it a couple other books. One of them is called way of the warrior kid. It's about a kid who turns into a warrior kid. Best book ever. Uh, extreme ownership book about leadership. It's combat leadership principles from war and how to apply them in your business and life. The discipline equals freedom field manual. Um, once again, to everyone that got this book, including Tim. Yes. Thank you for supporting it. Uh, also the, the book because of your support, it made the on New York Times bestseller list, which is, which is pretty awesome. Thank you everyone. Thank you, Tim. Course. Um, that's awesome. And, and you know the book, it doesn't follow any formula really. It's not normal. It's kind of like this podcast is not normal. It's not [inaudible] not everyone's going to get it. Some people going to turn it

Speaker 1:          04:00:20       on this podcast and go eat. I don't think I can listen to that. That's okay. Same thing with the book. That's okay too. I'm not here to write things that everyone likes him. I'm not here to record a podcast and everyone listens to, wants to listen to. I'm okay with that. Um, those of you that do get it, thank you for forgetting it. For those of you don't get it. Why are you still listening? Three and a half years later, it's not punishing yourself there. They're imposing discipline on themselves. I can make it this guy's annoying voice for another 20 minutes. Like I said, the Audio version is on empathy MP3 platforms. I've been asked that 5,000 times on social media. I've answered everywhere by the way, everywhere. So that's good. If you need some leadership support for your team or for your business echelon front, that's our leadership consulting company.

Speaker 1:          04:01:13       It's me, Leif, Babin, JP to know Dave Burke, info@echelonfront.com. If you want to get it echo, you got any clothing songs. That's it. Thanks Tim. Again. Yeah. Thank you gentlemen. Then I use the word gentlemen loosely if you want to keep this conversation going. We are actually on the interwebs fairly heavily on Twitter, Instagram and a face, a bulky, um, echo is an echo. Charles. I am at jockowillink and Tim is at t Ferriss. Two R's, two s's on Twitter, on Instagram at Tim Ferriss. Two R's, two s's on Facebook. Tim Ferris, you got it. Did I miss anything else? All right. Tim, any closing thoughts from you sir? Any closing thoughts? I'll share one quote if people like quotes that I think relates well to a lot of what we talked about and certainly Musashi and this is a quote from RK locus. So by the sound of the name you might guess it's very, very old and it is, we do not rise to the level of our expectations.

Speaker 1:          04:02:25       We fall to the level of our training. Hope is not a strategy as James Cameron would say. Train hard, train, train hard. Uh, Tim as always, thanks for everything. I literally would not be sitting here right now if it wasn't for you. Um, and what's cool is you've helped me out a lot, but more importantly, you've helped out all kinds of people all over the world. I think that's awesome. The content that you put out, the advice that you give to people. And so thank you for what you've done for me and thanks for what you do for all kinds of people everywhere. Thank you John. Much appreciated. Uh, and while I'm thanking people to close this out, I'm want to thank the real warriors out there better in uniform on the front, holding the line against evil. Thank you for what you do. And those of you that are back here in uniform at home, police, law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics, all the other first responders, thank you all for keeping our homeland safe and to everyone else that's listening this, remember that the world is filled with the sound of waves and the waves are filled with little fishes.

Speaker 1:          04:03:49       Let them play, let them dance. Let them sing you. You get on the path and stay on the path and keep getting after it. And until next time, this is Tim Ferriss and echo and Jocko

Speaker 4:          04:04:16       out.
