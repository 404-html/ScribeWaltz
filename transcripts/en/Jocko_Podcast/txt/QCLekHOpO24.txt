Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:00          this is Jocko podcast number 34 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good evening. Echo did evening and tonight we have a guest on the podcast back for a second time. My brother Leif Babin. Good evening. Good evening. Good to be back with you and if you don't know who Leif Babin is, real easy thing to do is go back to Jocko podcast number 11 and listen to that. I give him a long introduction and tell you about who he is. Guy That I served in the seal teams with and like I said, go back to 11 I think he gets rid of book. Yeah, we wrote a little book called extreme ownership. I'm sure we'll talk about that tonight. Life was one of the platoon commanders that that worked for me in the battle of Ramadi when we deployed in 2006 and just one of my brothers. So thanks for coming on the podcast to get extra. Grab me. What do you say to a man that by his own admission has no soul? Why would you say anything? I've thought about it a good deal, but he wasn't nothing compared to what was coming down the pike.

Speaker 1:          01:31          Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:34          They say the eyes are the windows to the soul. I don't know what that, Mies was windows too and I guess I'd as soon not know, but there is another view of the world out there and all the rise to see it and that's where this is going.

Speaker 1:          01:56          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:57          It is done. Brought me to a place in my life I would not have thought out of come to.

Speaker 1:          02:04          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:05          Somewhere out there. Easy, true and living prophet of destruction and I don't want to confront him. I know he's real.

Speaker 1:          02:19          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:19          I've seen his work. I walked in front of those eyes once. I won't do it again. I won't push my chips forward and stand up and go out to meet him. It ain't just being older. I wish that it was, I can't say that it's even what you are willing to do.

Speaker 1:          02:47          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:47          because I always knew that you had to be willing to die to even do this job. That was always true. Not to sound glorious at about or nothing, but do. And if you ain't, they'll know it. They'll see it in a heartbeat. I think it is more like water you are willing to become and I think a man would have to put his soul at hazard and I won't do that.

Speaker 1:          03:23          Okay.

Speaker 2:          03:26          I think now that may be, I never would.

Speaker 2:          03:36          Now that's the opening from the book. No country for old men, which is written by Cormac Mccarthy. You also wrote my favorite nonmilitary memoir book, the Book Blood Meridian, which is just an outstanding book and no country for old men was actually made into an outstanding movie as well, which almost follows the book word for word. It's, it's an awesome movie. And in the, in the movie and in the book there's a, there's a guy and that's who's talking to that opening, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell and he's explaining that he's seen evil in the world, the living prophet of destruction. And he seen his work and walked in front of those eyes. And ultimately, and that's kind of what the book is about. Sheriff Bell is explaining that he doesn't really want to face this evil. He doesn't want to put his soul at hazard.

Speaker 2:          04:34          So ultimately he doesn't really want to be a sheriff anymore. You can't face that kind of evil. So he leaves the Tube, put up the police and he retires and stays in his own little world and that's, that's the basis of it. And there's a way more to it than that. Then you should definitely read the book, have the book, which is, it's set. I think it's sent in about the 1980s early, early 1980s and the evil that he's speaking of that he's having to now deal with as a, as a sheriff is the drug cartels common out of Mexico, the border of Texas. They've escalated from, you know, petty little drug dealers back in the day and now it's a ruthless organized crime. Syndicates that murder with no mercy.

Speaker 1:          05:21          And

Speaker 2:          05:23          like I said, it's just too much for sheriff bell and he ends up walking away now meanwhile in 2016

Speaker 1:          05:35          okay.

Speaker 2:          05:36          The evil that we deal with now is even more pervasive and stronger and completely without mercy, and it's everywhere. And we can try it and ignore it, and we can try and act like it doesn't happen. There's some things that you

Speaker 1:          05:58          cannot ignore,

Speaker 2:          06:00          and in this case, it's something that we cannot walk away from.

Speaker 1:          06:07          Okay.

Speaker 2:          06:08          In late July of 2016

Speaker 1:          06:13          okay,

Speaker 2:          06:14          Father Jacques Hamel.
