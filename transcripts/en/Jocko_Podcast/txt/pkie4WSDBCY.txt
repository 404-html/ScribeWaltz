Speaker 1:          00:00:01       This is Jocko podcast number one 16 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good evening. Good evening. So this then was the culmination to die. Die in the stinking mud twice before I crossed this, no man's land darting from shell hole to shell hole. I'm no hero. I was numb with fear. But this time a barrage was on. I laid there at the wastelands edge thinking

Speaker 2:          00:00:44       was there any way

Speaker 1:          00:00:47       to the right lay crack shot? Snipers.

Speaker 2:          00:00:52       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       to the left in the brush machine. Guns

Speaker 2:          00:00:56       hungry, waiting

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       and fair in the front. Great. Bursting mud clouds playing toss with bodies. Yeah. Get through once more sun. The colonel had said communications down our guns firing short killing our boys. Yes it must be done.

Speaker 2:          00:01:25       But how? Wait

Speaker 1:          00:01:30       the barrage sweeping across the field and back a deadly windshield wiper were I to follow it down. And when I returned, dig in, I might

Speaker 2:          00:01:43       now

Speaker 1:          00:01:46       drunk with fighting fear. I chased the mud cloud down the field, kicking dead bodies, twisting like a ghost. And I laughed and I yelled, you bastards. You can't get me our trenches ahead. Almost there.

Speaker 2:          00:02:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:07       Back came hell's windshield wiper, vomiting, death, and I dug in, dug in with all I had

Speaker 2:          00:02:17       mom, dear God, help me on it. Came 40 feet, 20 feet. God, my head

Speaker 1:          00:02:37       torn from my body is this what being dead is like?

Speaker 2:          00:02:50       Peace, quiet,

Speaker 1:          00:02:53       clean, white sheets. My head must still be, it hurts me. These must be my fingers. I can move them and now a voice. My boy for you, the war is over. You hear that mom?

Speaker 2:          00:03:20       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:03:21       I'm still alive. I did not die. I'm coming home and that is

Speaker 2:          00:03:38       a poem

Speaker 1:          00:03:40       that was written by a man by the name of Ralph Moan of east main, who left his job as a civil engineer in Waterville, Maine to enlist in the army in 1917

Speaker 2:          00:04:00       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:01       Then he was wounded badly on that day, but he did live and he was decorated for his actions on that day in the citation for his award reads the president of the United States of America authorized by act of Congress nine July, 1918 takes pleasure in presenting the distinguished service cross to mechanic Ralph t Moen, United States army for extraordinary heroism in action while serving with company K hundred and Third Infantry Regiment. 26 division American Expeditionary Force near Rayville France 26 September, 1918 mechanic Ramon, who is detailed as a runner, made several trips carrying important messages across terrain, swept by constant fire from machine guns, snipers, trench mortars and artillery. His disregard for personal safety and devotion to duty in the prompt delivery of messages contributed greatly to the success of the action.

Speaker 2:          00:05:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:15       And Ralph Moan, according to his family, never spoke of the war to his children or his grandchildren.

Speaker 2:          00:05:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:24       But he did live with it

Speaker 2:          00:05:28       every day.

Speaker 1:          00:05:30       And tonight I am honored to have a guest back on the podcast who is also wounded in war, but who has not let that stop him in any way from driving on with his mission and his life and doing more than most people could ever even imagine. Mr Rob Jones, a marine,

Speaker 3:          00:06:00       a wounded warrior, and an inspiration to anyone that's a lucky enough to come into contact with him. Rob Jones, welcome back to the show.

Speaker 4:          00:06:13       Hey, you know what? It's an honor to be just a single time guest on what I consider to be the best podcast on the airwaves, but to be a two time guests, purely rarefied air. And I'm just appreciate you guys deem me worthy of a, of a second visit. So, and to be compared to that gentleman is even greater honor. So,

Speaker 3:          00:06:36       yeah. You know, I read that a while back and it was one of those things as I was reading it, I was thinking, I was thinking about you. I was thinking about, you know, I was thinking about Jodi, uh, thinking about Travis, think about you guys that were wounded bad and, and I've heard that before. It another is another book I read about World War One where guys, they wake up, they think they're in heaven because they see white sheets and they see you, there's a nurse there that's talking nicely to them and they think their dad, they think they're in heaven. And that, that reminded me, you know, when I read that I was thinking about you and, and, and having waken up, you know, in a, in a hospital somewhere. And I know you actually woke up. You're not supposed to wake up in Germany, but you did.

Speaker 4:          00:07:17       No, you're not supposed to. But uh, yeah, for whatever reason I woke up, I think I need to drink a water. So you need to hydrate. Yeah. I'm not sure why I woke up. I don't remember much, but, and uh, I didn't definitely didn't see anybody you could mistake for an angel or in this smelled squad leader. She's not an angel.

Speaker 3:          00:07:36       Well for anyone that's listening that hasn't listened to the first time rob was on, go back and listen to episode 92 and that's where we go through what rob went through, how he's raised, you know, growing up, joining the Marine Corps deployment to Iraq, deployment to Afghanistan. And that's, that's where rob was wounded, hit an IED and, and ended up losing both legs above the knee. But like I said, that didn't stop rob. And he went from that. And in the podcast we, we jumped really quickly through Sorta your healing process and we jumped right into the fact that you were, went out, did the, the Paralympics as a rower and we jumped into the fact that you rode a bicycle across America, which is yeah. Across America during the polar vortex, by the way. Yeah. That's all that stuff hasn't covered in 92 but I was, I was actually going back and I was listening to [inaudible] 92 and I realized that, you know, maybe it's just your, it's your attitude that might've might've made me kind of do this in the conversation.

Speaker 3:          00:08:45       Your attitude is like, yeah, I lost both my legs and then I was just competing in the Paralympics. You know, you, you, you made it sound like it's like it was like, it was easy. That's, that's the way it kind of came across in the podcast. And, and what, what I wanted to do today was kind of at least go back and talk a little with a little bit more detail about that process of going, cause it's a long process, right? Year and a half year for me anyway. Yeah. Yeah. A year and a half of, from letting the wounds heal all the way through. You know, where now you're, you're competing in the Paralympics and you're getting around in your mobile and all that. So you get back. How long does it take for your wounds because you can't do anything until your wounds are healed up, right?

Speaker 4:          00:09:33       No, I mean, well you can do some stuff. You can't do anything as far as prosthetics are confirmed, are concerned. So in the beginning, you know, the, the physical therapist would come in and they just basically just had me move my stumps around. And that would be like, you know, lift your right stump 10 times if your left one, move it out and back and then that would be it for the day or you know, I could do, you know, my arms still works. So I would do a little pull ups on my little trapeze bar that I had attached to the, uh, the bed. But yeah, it was, you know, surgeries every other day they just come in and uh, take me over and they would just be this cleaning the wound out and he dead tissue or anything that was still left in there. They cleaned that out. But I had these wound vac machines on that we're just constantly sucking the fluids out of the wounds because they were, they were open for the first month and yeah, so they're just like kind of suck in that stuff out and it's just a waiting game at that point. I mean you're, you can do some stuff like I've figured out how to, you know, it's slowly got to kind of furry, figured out how to move my body around and moved my legs around and get comfortable. And

Speaker 3:          00:10:40       were you getting like the phantom pains?

Speaker 4:          00:10:44       Yeah, I didn't get it as bad as Travis had it. I never had to do, uh, uh, what was it, a ketamine coma in order. I had it som, um, and they gave me this stuff called Lyrica, which is like a fibromyalgia medication and I got it. And I never really had it all that bad. It's like, it's pretty much at the same level. It is, is, is now where every maybe twice a day. My toe will kind of like hurt pretty bad for four or five seconds and that's it. But there's some people that have it a lot worse, so I kind of lucked out with that. But yeah, so first month, this kind of learning how to get into the wheelchair. Um, and you know, at first I wouldn't, I couldn't, I was so sore I couldn't really move very much. And so I haven't have to have a nurse.

Speaker 4:          00:11:32       And whoever was in there visiting me, if I wanted to get my wheelchair, I'd be sitting on this little pad and I'd say, all right, well I want to go for a role. And then so they would, the nurse would be on one side and the other person will be on the inside and they kind of like scoot me onto the wheelchair and then we'd have to take the wound vac machines and hook them onto the wheelchair and take my catheter, which I was very, very protective of that Catheter Jack, hang that on there. And then, uh, the Ivy Paul would have to come with me. And so then I would just kind of roll myself around the ward a couple times with, you know, my dad or my mom or somebody pushing the IV pole. And Yeah, just do that a couple times. Then I'd go see my buddy Daniel, because he couldn't get out of bed yet. So I go and see, visit him for a little bit and I go back to my room. And that'd be pretty much my exercise for the day and then have a like six milkshakes. This a eaten as much as I possibly could to, to help with the healing process.

Speaker 3:          00:12:31       Yeah. Where did you go through the whole woe is me, why did this happen to me? Did you go through that at all? And I, I mean, I know I've, I've listened some of your stuff and reading some of your stuff, you know, you talk about the fact that you knew you had to just move to like an acceptance phase right immediately. Is that, is that what you did? I mean, how did you get, look man, people hate all kinds of freaking roadblocks in life and, and very few of them are as heavy of and big of a roadblock as you hit and you seem to power through that thing. Like miraculously,

Speaker 4:          00:13:14       you know, I don't, I never, I never actually entered into an extended period that can be described as like a depression or woe is me or you know, feeling sorry for myself. It would come in very short waves, um, where, you know, I'd be, I'd be sitting around or I would struggle with something maybe. And then after I figured it out, I might sit there for a couple of minutes and be like, man, uh, but that'd be about it. And then we'd be go away after, you know, a minute or two, it'd be kind of like,

Speaker 5:          00:13:45       uh, I

Speaker 4:          00:13:47       almost kind of like, if you're, if you're talking to a girl in a bar and you like your voice cracked and he's just totally blow it and you look like an idiot and then you go back to the tape, we were like, man, he like that. It was, it was almost kind of like that or just like, man, how did I, how did I miss that IED? You know, man, this sucks. But, and I, you know, I didn't really think about it probably this way at the time. I couldn't articulate it at the time like this, but it's like

Speaker 5:          00:14:16       that.

Speaker 4:          00:14:17       Whether or not, you know, I deserved, I, I, you know, I did, I could acknowledge I didn't deserve it. I didn't deserve to be a double ibt. I didn't, uh, it wasn't, you know, fair. There's a lot of other guys that were running around in that same exact area. They didn't step on it, so it wasn't necessarily fair that I had to be in, uh, nfpt I didn't want to be an amputee, but

Speaker 4:          00:14:38       none of that mattered. Um, it did none of that had any bearing on whether or not I want it to have an enjoyable life. And I did. I sat there and I was like, well, what is my mission in life? If you really take it to its base level, you know, have an impact, uh, enjoy my life. That doesn't change just because now I'm an amputee and whether or not it's fair or the fact that I'm starting from a, you know, a little bit more of a disadvantaged position now all that stuff has no bearing on whether or not I want to accomplish my mission. And so realizing that you just kind of, well, what do I have to do now? That stuff's in the past. So all I can really affect is how I react to it. And you know, so I think that's kind of how I, I skipped all that stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:15:34       Did you, I know, um, one, one thing that I remember, and you know, one of my guys, Ryan job, he got, he got shot in the face and he got gravely wounded and you know, he, he ended up blind and um, he was down with a lot of casualties that had guys that had really bad brain injuries and he was there for a little while and you know, these were guys that had been severely wounded and like I said, had severe brain injuries. So they're having trouble communicating, they're having trouble with motor skills and, and these are almost all the time come with other physical injuries. And you know, his attitude was, hey, look, I'm taking up a bed here and we should give it to someone else. These guys are having a much harder time than me. I'm lucky because I didn't get that injury.

Speaker 3:          00:16:31       All I got was blind and you know, some, some, some damage to my face. But it was, it was amazing to me to see a guy like Ryan job who, who just looked at him itself and said, I'm lucky. I'm lucky those guys are worse off than me. Try and give your efforts to take care of these other guys instead of trying to take care of me. I can, I can do, okay, open up this bed for someone else to send me to, uh, send me somewhere else. And that's what they did. And I think that, you know, that attitude of like, Hey, this could be much worse. Right. And, uh, to me, first of all, hearing him talk about that was, was a testament to like the spirit of a guy that just is going to carry on and drive on and the things that he did before he died or was amazing.

Speaker 3:          00:17:27       You know, he graduated college with like, with like a straight, a grade point average. He got married, he, you know, his wife got pregnant. His, uh, he got a job with a defense contractor and he was like totally on the path and crushing yet despite the fact that he had, uh, you know, one of the best excuses someone could have, hey, I got wounded and I lost my vision. It didn't, it didn't slow him down at all. He climbed Mt. Rainier. He just did amazing things. And the, his attitude of, look, I'm in a bad place. Not that bad. I'm going to push on. And like you said, this isn't gonna, this isn't going to stop me from having a great life and, and, and getting after it basically. Yeah. So

Speaker 4:          00:18:10       couple of things. Uh, I'm glad you brought that up because it, there's definitely something to my own recovery during the time where I got there. So it's kind of like, I almost had a feedback loop on myself, so I got, I was immediately thinking about, even in the blast credo is one of my first thoughts was like, my mom's going to be pretty upset about this. And when I woke up in Jeremy, the one thing that I did was I asked for a stupid hat. I was like, Oh, my squad leaders there. I said, see if you can find us a stupid luck and a hat that I can wear when I come out of the ambulance. So that when my mom sees me for the first time, she'll see this stupid hat and maybe it'll make her laugh a little bit, you know? Um, but, you know, obviously they didn't find one.

Speaker 4:          00:19:00       And, um, but I think what happened was I had a good attitude in the first week or two and then that kind of set a precedent for myself and all my friends that came in, all my family that came in saw me with that solid positive attitude and that, you know, that gave them hope at the same time. So they had that hope and then I kind of went on and there was times, you know, they saw me already like that. So if there was ever a time where I was feeling sorry for myself or anything like that, I was like, you know what, my mom, my dad, all these people have already seen me being positive. And if I flip that around then that's going to hurt them now. And so I have to keep that in mind. So when I'm, it's not really about, well it's not only about me. So that forced my, that's forced me to make sure I maintain my positive attitude because you know, they're depending on me, I'm depending on them at the same time. So they're depending on me to stay positive so that they can stay positive. And so it kind of, we kind of fed off each other. And so, you know, that just kind of snowballed I guess until, you know, here we are.

Speaker 3:          00:20:15       Now you get so, so you're talking like a month of milkshakes. They weren't mint chocolate chip, but they were good. You know, and you're just feeding yourself. You're, you're trying to, trying to heal up, get the wounds to actually heal. And you're, every time you go around, every time you leave your bed, it's a gut check because you got to, you know, do the, the, the wound draining and all that other stuff. And then after a month, things are starting to heal up. At what point did you, were you able to like get yourself out, get yourself in the wheelchair?

Speaker 4:          00:20:50       I think I was probably after that first. So I was, I spent a week in the ICU, uh, you know, high on morphine. I don't remember much from that, that time period. And then I get to the ward and probably after that first week, maybe 10 days on the main ward, I'd be like, all right, I'm going to try and do this myself guys. And then it took five times the length of time, but I did it. And then from then on I was doing it on my own. And so, yeah, that, and that was kind of the biggest milestone for, you know, being in the hospital that during that healing period, uh, was being able to do that. And then so and then, you know, as they slowly took tubes away. Um, and then the final milestone for being in the hospital at that point was when my wounds were finally sutured closed and I got the skin graft, I'd take a skin graft from my left leg and put it on the inside of my right thigh.

Speaker 4:          00:21:46       And once they did that and that was the healed that they checked it out, made sure it was good, then I was ready to be transferred over to a Walter Reed, but I still had stitches, a all in my or staples, staples or stitches, one of the two. And so after that was done, that's when they transferred me over to Walter Reed. And even then I still had to wait for those stitches to come out before I could get fitted for prosthetics. And I was probably in the inpatient in the hospital for another two weeks while I waited for a room to open up in the outpatient housing. So it was pretty similar in those first two weeks. I just had the IV line. That's all I had. And you know, I could go out,

Speaker 3:          00:22:27       are they pumping you with antibiotics the whole time or what do they, what do they got? An Ivy and euphoria,

Speaker 4:          00:22:34       um, pain medication. Um, and I think it's probably just a stand at the just in case something goes wrong. They can, they have quick access. Uh, my buddy Daniel, he had a picc line to like straight into his heart. What's that? It's just, I think it's just a, a tube. They just put it straight, put it into your chest. And I guess maybe it's just for quicker access for pain medication. So I'd be in the hospital that first month and you know, the, they gave you the pain button so you can kind of control it yourself and to be funny because they, they, it only meters out so much in an hour. You can hit it like once every five minutes or something. But in the first week I'd be kind of passing out and I, whenever I woke up I'd hit it a couple times just to make sure I get in that dosage because I was scared. Like, what happens if this pain button goes away? Like I don't want to face that. And so they'd come in after an hour and the nurses say, you know, you can only hit this thing when we went every five minutes. Like yeah, yeah I know. I said, well you've hit it like $200 the last hour. Like oh well you know, I just hit it just, you know, I fall asleep.

Speaker 3:          00:23:38       Yeah. And so then during that time when you, when you were still had like stitches, but, and I know we talked about this a little bit, but you had like the triangle thing hanging above you or you start doing pull ups and you start trying to do some kind of upper body workout at that time.

Speaker 4:          00:23:54       Yeah, I mean, once I got to Walter Reed, I met my physical therapist that day and we set up the time I was going to come in, uh, seven o'clock frosh occupational therapy at eight o'clock for physical there. And we'd be just doing stuff on the mat tables so you don't have to be boring legs and you can be working on other stuff. While you're waiting for that stuff to heal. So yeah, I'd be doing kind of dips. I've raised my, the arms and my wheelchair up really high and I do dips and you know, they had stuff you could do, like a trunk strengthening exercises. You know, I, I wasn't the first double above knee amputee to come through Walter Reed. We've been at war for nine years, so they had this, all of these exercises already set up. So I'd come in, I do my exercises, lay a legless for the day and this work on what I could while we waited for that stuff to while we waited for my skin and we're just waiting on my skin basically to heal. How did you feel, like,

Speaker 3:          00:24:47       how did you feel regaining your strength and your upper body were, were you, like, were you like back on the gains path? You know what I mean? Were you like, okay, I just did, you know, yesterday I did eight pull ups and today I'm going to do 10 and the next day I'm, did you get, did you get yourself right back in like the old school workout mode?

Speaker 4:          00:25:04       Uh, just back on the path when I was still in the, when I was still in the hospital at Bethesda, uh, I would go into physical therapy, but he, you guys got to pull up bar or anything like that and then yeah, we have one, they had one in like a closet and I was, and I saw, I was like, Hey, I want to do some pull ups. And so I set the pullup record for people that had come through and it got broken by a seal later. But uh, so yeah, I set that pull up. It was like, let me see. I never lost the, the desire to see what I could do. You know, I was like, yeah, I'm going to do a max set of pull ups and see how many I could do still. But yeah, it was definitely frustrating cause I, I was, I lost a lot of muscle mass, but you know, once you started doing those exercises, like every time I came in I wanted to go at one more or two more or a little bit longer. And I had that same attitude when I started walking. You know, the first day I started walking, I'd maybe stood in my legs for two minutes and the next day I was like, you know, I'm going to try three minutes today or last yesterday I walked one time around the little track, I'm going to go twice, you know, just slowly building up and you know,

Speaker 3:          00:26:13       same. So what's that process like getting, getting standing up for the first time? What does that feel like?

Speaker 4:          00:26:19       It's wild. I mean, the first thing you gotta do is you've got to get cast it. It's, they have to make the sockets that go onto your, uh, stumps. And they do it, they make they a wrap this plaster around your stump and they mold it so that it's putting pressure on the right spots. And they take that off, they fill it up with some other kind of plaster material. Uh, they take the, the cast they made off and then they pour plastic around that. And so then you have, you're basically a mold of your leg and the first time you, the first time you step up in it is not comfortable at all or it hurts a lot because you're putting pressure on points that you didn't before and they kind of have to see you stand up and you're like, okay, well there's a spot right back there that hurts a lot.

Speaker 4:          00:27:12       So they take it off and they use this hairdryer and make it hot and they kind of mold that. They push it out against so it's not against that spot anymore. And then you put it back on, okay, that's comfortable. And then you do it for the other one. And for me, yeah. I mean I could, you could, you can't, I couldn't just walk from the first try. I had to have my arms on the, on the uh, the parallel bars and like it was, you know, that slow thing that you see kind of in, in movies where I took them maybe 10 steps and that was it for me. First Time

Speaker 3:          00:27:47       I've walked five balance or is it a little bit musculature? Like is it you're using different muscles?

Speaker 4:          00:27:54       Yeah. So you definitely, you're walking in a different way then your body's designed to, so when you walk you just go, you know, kind of forward and back here with your legs. You're Ben Bend at the knee to get it past the ground so it doesn't skip on the ground. Whereas when you're double above knee amputee, uh, you have to swing your legs out to the side at first cause you don't have that knee joint. You can't just bring them forward. So you kind of have to learn that and it's a lot of the balance your, your musculature has to kind of get used to what muscles you're using to keep your balance now. Uh, so that has to be figured out by your brain and your spinal cord. And then on top of that, just developing the resistance to the, the discomfort does, it's really not comfortable. And that's kind of probably what I didn't get tired. Like I could have stood for longer, but it's just my legs were hurting so bad. Yeah. Like you could run a mile or you could run a marathon or whatever, but if you're, if you're, if you have a blister on your tail, you know, then that's going to stop you.

Speaker 3:          00:29:04       It seems like the balance thing, like sometimes I've heard my like let's say hurt my ankle or hurt my, even something as stupid as hurt, like had a big cut on my, on the bottom of my foot. Yeah. And so you can't use your foot the way you normally do and it totally throws off your balance. And I can't even imagine you're, you're now trying to balance through the, through the perception of your nerves in your, in your stumps and, and how that feels and how you got to kind of adjust for that. That's gotta be like learning how to ski or something, learning how to do a balanced type sport, surf, something like that. I can, I can only imagine that that's gotta be what it's like to get your brain and like you said, your brain and your spinal cord to be able to adapt to what's happening underneath you when you have a totally new set of sensors down there now.

Speaker 4:          00:29:54       Yeah. And you'd have to also keep, have to keep it for a double above knee amputee and all this stuff I'm saying is this double above knee amputees. But uh, you're also losing two joints that help with balance. So enabled body person, they have, if they want to make a small adjustment, they use their ankle and then they can use the knee and then they can use the hip. But you know, double above knee, we, all we have is the hip. So it's an extra challenge learning how to make these adjustments with just, just your hips. But you know, it's kind of, it's a lot like a, a dog that has a missing leg. You know, the first time he goes to walk he kinda just figures it out and he is learns that new method and it's kind of, it's pretty much a similar thing. You know, you adapt to it and you just, you figure it out

Speaker 3:          00:30:37       ain't on the first prosthetics that you get. Are they articulated or they just like straight cause I know what you've got now. It was pretty, they look pretty damn advanced to me. I mean you can get you looking like a freaking term terminator robot over there. Are you getting that first? Cause it's an articulating because,

Speaker 4:          00:30:55       oh um, so yeah, it's in the balance in that realm. They keep you really short while you're relearning that balance because just in case you fall. So while you're relearning that balance and keep you really short. So basically I could, if I was going to fall, I just put my hand out pretty much and catch myself on the ground. And so while you'll read learning this balance, they keep you nice and short because your center of gravity, it's going to be lower. So it's a lot easier. And then also you kind of learn that hip motion, so they keep you nice and short just to make it a lot easier. And then as you get better, as you get stronger and a little bit better moving around, they make you a little bit taller. But there's no knee joint. It's just a, you go from your socket and there's a Bates straight cylindrical pylon made out of metal and that goes to the prosthetic foot and you probably have a shoe on the foot and then that's it. So you, you stay really short, uh, for three, four months.

Speaker 3:          00:31:59       And at this time are you already thinking about like what kind of crazy stuff you're going to do once you figure this shit out?

Speaker 4:          00:32:06       I, once I had found out about the Paralympics, uh, that was probably my first week when I was at Bethesda in the hospital bed, just researching. I wanted to get back in the gym and I didn't know what I could, what I'd still be able to do in the gym. So I was maybe looking for, I forget what I searched, but like disabled sports or disabled working out or something like that. And I found the pair Olympics and at the time I wasn't saying to myself, I'm definitely going to commit to going because they didn't know much about it and I still had this big, I still had to take, you know, a year and a half to relearn how to walking. And that was numero uno, uh, to learn how to do. But yeah, it was kind of in the back of my head, I had found about it and I was thinking about it.

Speaker 4:          00:32:46       That's kind of how things work for me. I can, the idea is impregnated initially and like I, okay, that's an interesting idea. You know, Paralympics. Okay, that's interesting. I go ride my bike, cross country. Okay, interesting. And then I think about it a little bit more and time goes on. I think. Yeah, I could probably do that, you know? And then eventually I'll get to a point where like, all right, I'm going to do it and then I commit to it. And so at this point, you know, I hadn't committed to it, but I was researching and you know, contemplating and figuring out the feasibility and you know how I would go about it if I wanted to try and make the attempt.

Speaker 3:          00:33:26       That seems like that would have a massive positive impact on your mindset. So something that I talk about and I talked about with Jordan Peterson and he agreed with me on this idea of finding a new mission and having a new mission. So a lot of times, I'm sure you've seen this too, I've definitely seen it when guys get out of the military for whatever reason, when they get out, the guys that do well are the guys that have a new mission to go on and on, whether it's a new job or whether they're going to be a super dad or whether they're going to go to school and get good grades. Those guys do good. And in their new mission, the guys that have the most trouble from what I've seen most of the time is the guys that don't have a, a new mission there.

Speaker 3:          00:34:08       They get out and they say, well, you know, I might do this, I might do that, I might do something else. But what they're really doing is nothing. They don't have any real direction. And they end up, you know, what's the mission? The mission becomes, have another drink, you know, uh, do something unproductive, do what feels good immediately. And it's becomes problematic. But it seems like the fact that you found something immediately, you realize that there was a goal that you could go after, even if it was only a little idea at first. That idea can carry you a long way.

Speaker 4:          00:34:39       Yeah. And you know, also, luckily for me it wasn't like, it was, it's not like I was in Afghanistan one day and then separated the next day. I kind of had a mission that was, you know, it came about, uh, about by its own because, you know, I just lost my legs. My first mission was learn how to walk. So I had that right away. But you know, while I was taking that time to do that, I was thinking about, you know, what I'm going to do after? I get out and you know every, every guy that gets out of the military, you know most of the time you know when your contract's going to end so you can start thinking about it earlier. But it's definitely no, I agree with you. Having having something to work towards is a hugely important,

Speaker 3:          00:35:21       I'll, I'll tell you that even what you just said. So there's people that they get out and you're saying, hey, I had this new mission cause I had to at least learn how to walk. There's, there's people that they get out and they don't have a new mission and they don't figure one out and that becomes problematic. And I, and you know what, let's not just apply it to the military. I'll apply this to every human being happy kids get out of college happens when kids get out of high school happens when you go through, you know, you've got something that you're looking at or something that you're focused on and boom, it goes away. Well now what are you going to do? And if you don't line something up and don't focus on something, you don't take aim at something, well then you're not going anywhere.

Speaker 4:          00:35:58       Oh yeah. It's like when you're, you know how you shoot, do you guys call it table to when you're kind of working on a shooting like targets that are right in front of you. We don't call it terrible too. We call it table two is table one is kind of the long distance drive range. But it's almost kind of like when you're, when you're doing that and you, they say, okay shoot this guy twice and that guy twice. So you do that and then at the end you scan and make sure there's nobody else around. So it's kind of like doing that. Your mission is to shoot the thing, but you also have to be looking out for other stuff. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:36:28       yeah. No, absolutely. You know it's, it's funny too cause I think about like when you think about kids that you grew up with and like high school, they get done with high school and there's some kids that, Oh God, I'm going to go into college. I'm going to go to military. Yeah. There's some kids that don't know what they're going to do after high school and what happens to him. You know, what happens to them? They, they, they, they flounder around. They get a little job here that they don't really like, they do something else. They don't really like, you just have to be careful of that. You have to be careful. And I'd say as a parent, that's something to look out for it too. You know, you gotta look out for your kids and make sure your kids have something to focus on. Have something that they're striving for. Because if you don't have anything to strive for, if you're not trying to go anywhere, if you're not on some kind of mission, that that's problematic.

Speaker 4:          00:37:18       Yeah. And you know, so since I had that, everything I did during the day, it mattered to me because I had something that was vastly important to me that I was trying to achieve. So if I didn't care about whether or not I walked again, then I could just roll around in my wheelchair. And it wouldn't matter if I worked out that day. But since I really, I learned how to walk again and be totally independent and get rid of my wheelchair and all that stuff to be able to run and do everything I was able to do before that was, you know, the most important thing. And so I fed off that when, you know, I didn't feel like going into therapy because I was my back hurt or whatever. And the, you know, whether or not I do that third, fourth set of balanced drills or you know, a strengthening exercises, you know, that had an effect on, on that goal. And, and so, and the same thing with going to the Paralympics. You know, I wanted to be able to, to explore that. And so the stuff I was doing in the hospital, it mattered.

Speaker 3:          00:38:27       So this is interesting because, uh, we were actually talking about this the other day. So you end up with, and I guess again, I'm just trying to break down. Obviously

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       you're a person that, that can push through pain and suffering and push through short term, uh, challenges in order to achieve a longterm goal. And I think that the way you break it down is you're looking, even when you're, you're suffering from a challenge right now, you're, you're, you know, I don't feel like doing another balance to drill because my back is sore or whatever. Yeah. Well people hit that, those kinds of obstacles every single day, you know, they don't want to get up in the morning, they don't want to work out, they don't want to do the last set, et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera. But you had, you tie those small term, short term things, the short term pain because you have a longterm goal that you really care about.

Speaker 4:          00:39:21       Yeah, exactly. I mean it's, it's all a matter of what matters to you most, uh, you know, is what's more important to you learning for or for me, learning how to walk again or staying in bed today. You know, staying in bed would be nice. It would feel good. I'd be able to watch. I think what I was watching on Netflix, I was watching 24 of the series on Netflix. I can watch an entire series of 24 today or something and I could do that and that would be fun. But at the end of the day, I'm still not gonna be any closer to being able to walk again. And I would much rather be able to walk everywhere. I went totally independently then find out what happens to Jack Bauer, you know, so, and then, you know, at the same time, you know, if, if you're working on, you know what people like to leave it. If you want to lose weight and you know, do you, would you rather have a milkshake mint chocolate chip milkshake or would you rather it cook cookie dough milkshake? Would you rather have that milkshake or would you rather, you know, be able to run 10 miles or not get winded when you're walking with your kids or in a playing with your kids. It's like what, which one matters to you more? And I always pick that bigger one because I mean it's, it's pretty straightforward for me.

Speaker 1:          00:40:44       The delayed gratification is the delayed gratification versus the instant gratification delayed but much more enjoyable. Yeah, much more durable. Definitely better and better for your whole life. Last longer too by the way. Yeah. Yup. And enduring. It's an enduring, lasting, longer lasting, enduring thing that you end up with. [inaudible] that's what people need to tap into. That right there. That's good. How you have a like a way, like almost like a, I don't want to say scaffolding, but like a way to look at it. Like how you, when you're presented with like an option, you're, hey, you're conscious of it. B, you have a way to look at it where you're like, okay, which one is important to me? Which one, you know, is Jack Bauer in 24 important to me? Whereas walking important to me, you know, so most people, they just on how they feel,

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       you know, I really don't feel like doing this so I'll do this or I really am in the mood for this, so I'll do it kind of thing. They don't like kind of in a way, break it down like how you do just, yeah, just from moment to moment where you'll be like, okay, I have this way to look at it and I'm gonna look at it this way and then I can re or, or behave, you know that it actually is, that's pretty a good way of looking at it. You put it into a binary calculation, right? There's two options. Don't go like, am I going to do the thing that's gonna make, make me better in the long run or the thing that's gonna make me worse in the long run and feels good right now. Which one are you going to do this? You just make that into a binary decision. Yeah, but he didn't his release. So simple. Which one's important to me and it's, it's almost like a black or white.

Speaker 4:          00:42:18       No. Which ones? What's driving your behavior? And then you can even take it another step. Like, again, like the losing the weight example, you, you will either want to have the milkshake or you want to be able to, you know, walk around with the guys. Even if you don't care about, you know, being overweight or you're not being able to move your body around, you know, you can still lose the weight by figuring out what, even if you don't feel like going on a diet, like what is it that necessitates you to go on the Diet. And for me, so I didn't want necessarily to train every day for the Paralympics. I didn't necessarily want to ride my bike every day on my bike ride or run them. I didn't necessarily enjoy doing that. I didn't feel like doing it, but I had to do that because my goal necessitated me to do that. So if you're struggling to get motivated to lose weight, just for the sake of losing weight, find something that necessitates you to lose weight, that really matters to you. Like, you know, not dying when you're 55 of a heart attack,

Speaker 3:          00:43:26       that'll do it. Um, there's, there's three things that you talked about on the law. Well, we talked about it on the last podcast, but I kind of breathed it, breezed over them. And I, and I realized when I listened to it again, I should've talked to you a little bit more in depth because I think it's helpful for people to hear again to hear from you who's overcome incredible challenges. There's three things that you talked about. Um, and it's actually in the journal, which you, which you have a journal Online, um, on, on Rob Jones, journey.com. But, and this is there as well, but number one, number one is writing down goals. Number two is celebrating milestones and number three is overcoming rationalization. So let's just break those down a little bit. How strict were you with writing down your goals? And do you still do that?

Speaker 4:          00:44:14       Um, I don't, I guess I don't physically, you'll have a pen and paper and write it down. I think what I do now is I'll announce it or something like that, or I'll, I'll make it known that that's what I'm planning on doing check. So when I decided to do my marathon challenge, I did it on Facebook or something, or I'd put it on all my social media platforms and then it's out there now. Okay, now I'm responsible. This is beyond writing it down. Yeah. This is like writing it down or selling it to the world or telling people that you want to have the respect of like if I told my wife Pam, like I, I'm going to do this. And she,

Speaker 2:          00:44:55       okay,

Speaker 4:          00:44:55       she knows I'm a person that she respects me for living up to what I say I'm going to do. I don't want to lose her respect. So now, um, even, even though I would have done it regardless, I'm not saying I would've said I wouldn't do it. And then that fallout or back out I another mission, even if the mission became not important to me, there was another, another aspect of that. And you know, you, you've committed to it at that. So that's another aspect of my personality where not only do I want to help veterans, but now I've committed to some, I said I'm going to do, and I've given my word and now there's people that are kind of relying on me to, to do that. And if I, if I say I'm going to do it, then I say, oh, we could never mind. I actually, I'm not going to do it then they're actually losing a little bit of hope. Maybe. Cause they were, they were hoping I was going to do it and they, we're going to get something out of it now, now that I'm not doing it. So they're kind of losing that, that benefit. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:45:49       Makes Sense. Yeah. So it's beyond writing it down. It's writing it down or announcing, announcing it. Celebrating milestones.

Speaker 4:          00:45:56       Yeah. So it's really hard to stay motivated when there's this obscure goal that is two years away or a year and a half away and you're not really seeing

Speaker 4:          00:46:15       huge progress towards everybody. You getting like a millimeter every day. Um, it gets old, you know, you feel really motivated in the beginning, right. Cause you're pumped up and you have tons of energy and then when you, and at the end you can see it, you can smell the barn and you can see it. So you find the extra energy in your, in yourself. But in that, that middle part where you're not, you're not even sure that you're going to be able to do it and it's so far away and you're like, man, I'm, I'm only like halfway and I still have, I've done all this stuff and now I still have to do all that again. Um, it helps too.

Speaker 2:          00:46:52       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:46:52       Pick stuff along the way that, you know, is going to, uh, to be there. That kind of, you know, all right. I'm not, I'm going for that far away thing, but right now I'm going to that. And that's what excites me. So when I was in the hospital, getting in the wheelchair was my first little milestone, the, I had a year and I didn't even know how long it was going to take me to learn how to walk again. Right. At least I was thinking like a year and a half, two years. Yeah, that's a long time and with a lot of work in between. So all right, right now does get into the wheelchair and then all right, well learn how to do it on your own and then after that get your legs and then figure out how to walk with only one cane instead of two canes keeping you up and then drop the other cane and that's another milestone.

Speaker 4:          00:47:40       And then you get your bionic knees and so you probably go back to the canes for Awhile and then when you have those you take away that cane and then take away the other one. And then you learn how to run and then you learn how to do ride the bike or whatever. So you just keep finding little things along the way. And you know when I was doing, when I was training for triathlons, I do this on a small scale. I would have ate two minute all out sprints on my bike to do and I'd be sitting there on the first one and I'm like, oh my God, I have eight of these to do. The first one would just blow me up. I'm like, Oh my God, I have seven more. And I would just be like, you know what, just focus on this next one.

Speaker 4:          00:48:18       Just do this one and then we'll focus on the next one after that. And then, so just, I would even trick myself sometimes I'd be like, all right, I'd be at my sixth one, I'd be so tired. And the arc, you know what if I can maintain this speed or if I can make my power maintain my power output for this entire seventh one, I'll skip the eighth one is I'll treat myself, I'll skip the eighth one. I do the seventh one, I'd be like, all right, I'll just do the eighth one cause you know, I, I do that something to treat myself, you know? So, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:48:47       So it's interesting. So what, you've talked with his back on me in these, in this thing, and I've talked about this before. I've talked about before, multiple times. Uh, I don't even know if I've talked to from the Pie, I must have talked about in the podcast, but I've taught, I talk about it with people, which is you have long range stuff and you have short range stuff and what you have to do is you have to put the both pose in your mind and you have to shift the focus back on forth, back and forth between the two to whichever one is going to get you moving. Because when the goal is too far away, you're like, ah, you know what is not going to really make a difference if I skip this thing today, it's not that big of a deal. The goal is too far away.

Speaker 3:          00:49:22       It gets blurry and, and so what you need is you need to put, okay, just the obs do the short call. Well, after the daily grind beats you down on the short goal, you start to forget what the longterm goal is and you guy, you know what? I don't, I don't really need to do this workout today or I don't need to do, I can eat this food or I can do whatever because it's not going to make a big impact on the long thing. You know, w what am I doing anyways? Then you've got to look back at the long goal and that's right. I have this, this thing that I'm trying to make happen and it's these small goals that are going to get me there. So you got to shift. You got to have both the longterm goal that's gotta be something that you really want to achieve.

Speaker 3:          00:49:56       You've got to understand why, you know, like you said, you got to understand why it is you want to achieve it. You can't just be something that you don't care about and then you got to have that as your primary driving force. But your secondary driving force, which is equally important, is these short term things that you can get to, that are there, that are close, that are you can achieve even if it's two minutes. Even if it's, I did Tabata a Tabata on the air bike the other day, bro. Yeah, I was there. I was like, you know, and my daughter was there. My wrestled,

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       my daughter that Russell's, she was there and so she's kind of like calling me out but, but in a positive way. She's like a positive person. Yeah. She was hyping me and I put out hard cause she was there going, come on. You know what it's like when your, your daughter's going to come on, dad pushed harder. You're like, oh awesome. Yeah I'm going to get some, I want him to die. You know, you know the blood tastes in your mouth, you know? Yeah. Whatever that thing is. So I had some of that going on but, but yeah, you have the short term and you have a longterm goals. You got to have them both and you gotta they've gotta be attached somehow. But you've got to lean on which one is going to get you to do what you know you're supposed to do.

Speaker 1:          00:51:09       You know you're supposed to do, that's a little psychology behind just getting after it. Right. This is a little psychology behind just getting after it. A little head games. You Echo and I were talking the other day and he was all, he was kind of surprised because I was talking about there's a one workout that I do, which is PR. It's I, it's my hardest and most brutal workout and it's in, it's in the field manual, but it's a 20 rep squat. You Do, you do, you take a weight that you can squat 10 times and you do it 20 times. And like after rep 12 every single rep is just, it just, it's, it's pain. And then you do that and then you lay on the floor for 20 minutes and then you get up and you do it again and you lay on the floor for 20 minutes and you'd get up and do it again.

Speaker 1:          00:51:59       So it's three sets in one hour to one hour workout. But I was telling an echo, I was like, yeah, there's times where I'm in the middle of like set two and I'm on rep 14 and I'm like, I don't even, I don't even think I want to be strong. I don't want to be strong. I don't, I don't even care from healthy. I just want to, I just want to just this, this, this is horrible. Why would I be doing this right now? This is stupid. Yeah. Relief. Any kind of weave. But, but actually what gets me to push through those is I think to myself, Oh, you hear that? That's actual weakness in your mind right now. Actual living weakness gets a voice in your mind right now. Are you going to listen to it? Are you gonna listen to it? No. You're not going to listen to it.

Speaker 1:          00:52:42       Are you doing, I'm a straight through or you, yes, that's it's, it's an old school workout that I originally got from, well, there's a book called super squats. There's a book called super squats if, and that book has this workup, but the, actually that book only has you do one set. You do one set. I was the idiot that sought to myself. Well, if one set is good, how about I do three sets of that and it's brutal. It's brutal. Yeah. It's like, well, I have to do it now. Yeah, no, that's another thing. That's another thing I say is, is you know, if you don't really feel like working out, okay, that's fine. Write down what you're going to do and then just do it. Just turn off your brain and just do what you're supposed to do. Just put the numbers down

Speaker 6:          00:53:26       and do what you're supposed to do. You're not, every day is all happy, you know? This is great. I'm feeling myself getting stronger. No, I feel like I'm gonna Puke. That's not cool, but that's good. That's like, like kind of like you're talking about how if you go by how you feel every day. Like I feel like doing this or I'm feeling motivated, feeling where it's just like you're saying rob, where are you? You are in the habit of looking at it a certain way. Like what's important to me, how you feel. It's kind of shuffled to the side. It's like what's important. Okay, now I'm going to get moving. Yeah. Feelings are not, not generally not a good thing to rely on to make things generally not a good, they can trick you though. You know how like, just like, how are you saying in the beginning, you know when you first decided to do something you don't like New Year's resolution?

Speaker 6:          00:54:18       What are, you know, like it's real common thing where at the BNA exciting, let's start this new thing and then at the end it can be, because you see the goal right there, we're about to do it, you know, kind of thing. But in the middle it's like, yeah, so feeling can, I don't want to say, yeah, you're, you're right. Don't rely on it, but it can trick you because in the beginning when you have that feeling like you want to, it's like, it's almost like you think it's going to be there the whole time. That's a new thing. This is the new thing from me. I'm, I've never felt like this about anything I've ever done. I'm excited about this one. Then it goes away and then you're like, oh, we're not doing that.

Speaker 4:          00:54:50       Always had that energy at the end, like of a, I bet like the, the last one of that to Bata that you did was like, well where was all that energy? Have you guys ever heard of the central governor theory of fatigue? Well, it's basically about two different, so see if I can do this without making it super long. There's two different, we got eight hours of recording time. There's two different 18 theories on how your body, I guess processes fatigue or what it exactly it is. And so there's the, I think it's called the catastrophic theory where basically your journey, you tabatas and something breaks down and then like, uh, you run out of energy totally deplete yourself of glycogen or whatever. And then you, you can't because you don't have any more glycogen, so you muscles just don't work. And then there's this other theory, which is kind of the accepted theory now that your brain has a governor in it and it's, it's getting all this information from your muscles and your senses.

Speaker 4:          00:55:59       It's getting all this information. It's calculating how much energy it meters out. And so when you're doing your Tabatas, the first one, you have all sorts of energy. So your brain is like go and it's connected to your subconscious and your constant kind of connect because you kind of know how many sets you do and your brain actually calculate that. Calculate to that end too. It's how it decides to do this. So that first one you're like, oh, if tons of glycogen available me so I can just blow through this first one. And then as you go, uh, your, your, your brain's getting the signals that you're running, you run out of glycogen, maybe the calcium to contract the muscles is kind of getting low. And so it kind of dials you back, uh, automatically by contracting less muscle fibers. And so you kind of get, and it makes you feel fatigued. So they say that fatigue is actually a fatigue and pain are actually emotion. So it makes you feel these emotions,

Speaker 6:          00:56:55       fatigue, fatigue.

Speaker 4:          00:56:57       So it makes you feel this and it kind of dials you back. And then on that last one, you know that this is your last one. So it's like, all right, well we're done after this, so I'm going to let it go. And then

Speaker 6:          00:57:11       is the theory, so it's kind of that kind of book. So there is this thing called the gold. I think I told you this, a Gold Ji 10 I think I'm pronouncing it correctly. Golgi tendon organs, a little regulator, and they're essentially like clusters of nerves that going. And so this is more like high intensity. Like I'm gonna do a two rep, one rep to rep through your rep, whatever Max. So that's regulated by your brain. So when you get too much stress on your muscle, your brain says, hey, that's too much stress. You're going to stop the muscle contraction or let off. Usually it stops it. That's why if you go for a two rep Max, one rep Max, you can get it here and then you just poop and it fails. You fail. But if you can get, if the, if it doesn't fire, you'll go and you'll push, you'll push.

Speaker 6:          00:57:53       Sometimes you'll pause and you can still put like, why did you just fail the other time? You know what I mean? Yeah, it's that. So, um, and then if you go to lower intensity stuff, then it goes more into the glyco like you ever seen like a marathon runner or you know, some real long like I don't know, an obstacle courses where the guy's like mentally you can tell he's, he's not going to quit but his legs are like shivering and shaking and he, it's like he's almost like he's going to pass out or something like that. It, so that's more of that. That's like your physical capability, the energy, the physical energy system is failing. That's, you know, so that's a different thing. So it's funny that would be bound, I'm sure when you were in boot camp or going through buds, like how many pushups are you going to do?

Speaker 6:          00:58:38       You're just going to keep doing pushups. Yeah. You literally just keep doing push ups and push ups and push ups and pushups and personable. Some push ups and push ups and pushups and sometimes you lay there for on flat on your face for like 20 seconds. But then they say keep going. And so you just keep going and then you keep going for a little while and then you lay on your face for a little while and then you keep going like you can just keep going for, yeah. Unless you get to that now sometimes on like a run someone would pass out and like that would be that. Yeah. What's that? Yeah. According to this there would be your,

Speaker 4:          00:59:11       your brain basically shut you to saw you and you see somebody running at the end of a marathon and they're like the, their legs aren't working. That's kind of their body. They've been able to somehow through all the pain and all that stuff, they've been able to put, they'd been motivated to push through and then finally your body gets to a point that if we keep going, we are going to die, so I'm shutting you down and it just hits the hits the shutdown button and then your legs a stop where I just, it will just stop contracting your muscles or I don't remember how we got on this subject.

Speaker 6:          00:59:41       Yeah. Pushing through. The engine is still going, but the fuel doesn't get to the engine. So the engine starts, you know that there's a little math on situation, but in like a higher intensity stuff, it's, it seems like, you know, he'd, given what I, what I know about the Golgi tendon organ situation, it seems like you're a Golgi tendon expert. Yes. But we'll hear, this is, this is when I really, I learned about it in college, but when I tore my bicep, you know, you know, guys will lift real hard and just tear their muscle off the bone because when you train heavy, you're training to, to, um, to what he's done to mitigate the effects of the Golgi tendon or that's, or like huge rushes of adrenaline. And we'll do it too. You know, you hear the story about them, the lady, she saw the car, left the car off the kid off the kid.

Speaker 6:          01:00:26       Yeah. So basically you're just bypassing the Golgi tendon, Oregon because of these extreme situations. But by nature, try lift up a car, you kind of can't. And the same, I mean the, you know the, well most of us can, but when you do like a one rep Max like Uber, when you test for that and you see it all the time where you know the guy, let's say, I don't know, he does three 55 right? Like he even, there's like a pause because he's pushing so hard and he's barely any Guinea gets it put on three 65 pounds more. He gets it like a quarter of the way up and it just falls on his chest, you know, because it fires and boom muscle shutdown. That's what that is.

Speaker 4:          01:01:05       Yeah. And when you're doing the heavy, you're also teaching your kind of teaching your body to most people can only contract 30% of their muscles at one time because their brain doesn't let them, cause if they attracted all of your muscle fibers at the same time, it could produce an injury. So when you lift heavy, your brain has kind of learning, all right, I can, I can can drag this many. Oh, okay, now I can contract this many. And like the best people still can. Only contract like 50% of their, their muscle five Olympic lifters. Yeah. That's like, cause they're just, yeah, exactly. Or like really heavy power lifters.

Speaker 3:          01:01:36       Mm. So now on the, on the last podcast we talked about the Paralympic growing. So, and we talked about you biking across across the country again, which is from Maine to San Diego. And we, and again if you want to get people should go listen to those on, on podcasts 92 and, but, but when you were on last time, you were talking about your latest announcement, your latest goal that you had written down in and announced to everybody, which was that you were going to run 31 marathons in 31 days, which is just kind of um, a little bit psycho. And actually you wrote down, I'm going to read this excerpt from your, from your online journal.

Speaker 2:          01:02:22       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:02:22       Here we go. Back to the journal. I can't, this is an expression that is vilified in our minds beginning at a young age. Every time a young child announces this decision, they are corrected. The first adult that hears it, ask them whether or not they have even tried. Generally, this confrontation will result in the child giving their task. Another attempts until their attention span moves on to something else. The adult will see this and chuckle to themselves with knowledge that this is just a child who has yet to learn the art of art and virtue of perseverance. By the time this child comes of age, however, they will have been told by adults more times than they could count that there is no such thing as can't. It is interesting then to think about how many adults seem to proclaim this expression in their lives.

Speaker 3:          01:03:12       It is because, is it because like many things that adults tell children, they are simply telling the child a general rule that the child must follow but can be broken once one has grown or is it because these adults are simply repeating what they were told as children without thoroughly examining what the phrase I can't truly suggests. If you confronted an adult that claims they can't do something with the same question about whether or not they have tried, the answer will almost always be yes. Adults have learned enough to know that it is unreasonable to say they can't until they have at least tried once. Therefore, the real question that we should be asking in responses, have you tried everything?

Speaker 3:          01:03:58       Have you exhausted every possible option, scenario, combination, tool and approach? I do not simply refer to the ones that you knew of at the time you decided to undertake your task. I mean have you re also researched possibilities that you had known about? Have you determined whether or not there is another person out there that has performed the exact same task you are attempting or at least something similar? Have you exhausted this research? Have you read every book, blog, Journal, magazine, bathroom stall and website? If the answer to any of these questions is no, then go back and try again. Because if you don't because you don't truly know if you can do something until you've tried absolutely everything. The fact of the matter is that rarely if ever, is the answer to all of these questions. Yes. Therefore, what is it that people actually mean when they say, I can't a more accurate but more verbose way of saying it would be, I don't care about or want enough this task or the results and benefits of it in order to do all that is necessary to achieve it. I was told countless numbers of times by people during my month of marathons that they couldn't run one marathon, let alone 31 straight. Every now and then when I had time, I would discuss what they'd said. We would jointly conclude that if something they cared about and depended on them doing so, it would be possible. The most common example I used was if someone had a gun to your child's head, do you think you could do it? Then

Speaker 3:          01:05:47       therefore, the phrase, I can't denotes a lack of investment as opposed to a lack of potential or ability. I do not mean to say that every person I had this conversation with should have had the motivation to run marathons. It was something that I decided to do, not them. I merely wanted to express to them what I am expressing here. Given the right purpose and enough time, you can,

Speaker 2:          01:06:15       okay,

Speaker 3:          01:06:16       what happens if someone has said they can't? We have asked them if they've done everything and the rare cases happen and they honestly say yes. Do we concede that then they can't? Nope. If everything in existence has been attempted enough to determine that it won't work, then congratulations. You've been awarded the honor of being the person who must invent the method or the tool or determine the right combination, whether or not you will. Once again boils down to how much you care and time. It may end up being that a person ends up trying for their entire life. But I suggest removing the phrase I can't from your lexicon and replacing it with, I can't yet.

Speaker 2:          01:07:06       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:07:07       Do this so that you don't risk being on your death bed saying I didn't.

Speaker 2:          01:07:16       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:07:17       So, yeah, and I don't mean to like if somebody comes up and says, I can't do something, I'm not going to say, I'm not going to, you know, and I know what they're really saying. Um, and I don't, I'm not going to judge them and I don't care if you, if you don't care about this thing and it doesn't matter to me, but, uh, you should just be a little bit more accurate in what you're saying. You know, I'm not, like if you, if you say I can't run a marathon, that's fine. That's fine. You don't, you don't want to run a marathon. You don't care about running. It doesn't matter to you. And that's your personal choice, you know? But, uh, to say that you can't do it, having never even attempted it, uh, is just not an accurate statement.

Speaker 3:          01:08:00       So where'd you get the idea to attempt 31 marathons in 31 days?

Speaker 4:          01:08:04       So, uh, after my bike ride, I tried to make the Paralympics for triathlon and I did not succeed. I failed and that attempt, but with every failure, there is a lesson learned. And I learned when I was training for a triathlon that I was pretty good at running. I was able to run the five k triathlon, a five k distance at the end of the triathlon at 18 minutes flat, which is pretty fast. That's, that's maxing out the Marine Corps. Pft. You can't get any faster than that. And so it's pretty fast. So I, and I, I realized, you know, I, I've, I've decent a decent talent for running and I'd run the Marine Corps marathon the year before and I, so I knew that I could run a marathon and I was just kind of, you know, after this failed attempt to make the Paralympics, cause it's kind of thinking about what my next mission could be.

Speaker 4:          01:08:55       And I wanted to do another thing like my bike ride. And I had heard about other people doing this kind of thing where they do, you know, 50 marathons in 50 days in 50 states or 50 iron mans, 50 days in 50 states. So, you know, I decided I wanted to do marathons, um, and I kind of put my own little spin on it and I said, well, you know what, I want to get this story and in front of as many eyeballs as I can. So to do 50 minute earth to do 31 marathon straight in my backyard isn't really going to do that. So I need to do, I could go down to the trail everyday for 31 straight and do it and nobody would ever care and nobody would ever find out about it. And it'd be the same amount of, it'd be just as impressive to do.

Speaker 4:          01:09:43       Um, and so all right, I want to get this in front of as many eyeballs as possible. So I need to do it in major cities where there's a lot of people that can find out about it and spread it that way. And so I figured, all right, I'll take that same formula and do 31 marathons and all in different cities. And I picked 31 because I was trying to figure if a good number. So I, I started with the 20 number, which is the number associated with number of veterans suicides every day. I figured that'd be a pretty powerful number. But after thinking about that, I kind of figured it wasn't enough. It wasn't enough marathons in a row. And I figured by the time, more marathons, by the time I got started with that I'd be, and by the time I got kind of some momentum going and pretty much be over, and so I didn't figure to have it as big an impact.

Speaker 4:          01:10:34       So I wanted to do more. So I was like, well what about 50 and so I was like, well, okay, 50 I could probably do it if I train enough for it, but 50 might be too many, it might be too long. So by the time I started getting going and then I, you know, I'm at 40 I still have 10 more people are going to kind of maybe lose interest and be like, oh, is that guy still doing that? Because I found out about the iron cowboy doing his 50 iron mans in 50 days. And I kind of had that same thing where I was like, Oh hey, this is gonna be awesome. I was following him for the first couple of weeks and then eventually I'm like, oh, does he still is either finish it? Oh Wow. I kind of lost it. And so I'm like, all right, well what if I just did it for a month? I think people could probably pay attention for a month. Then we'll really be interested for a month before they really move on. It's like all right, month, okay month and marathons and longest month is 31 so I picked 31 and I have to say when no, you're doing, you know what you're doing is hard when you come on Jocko podcasts. And he says, this is insane. Jocko Willink says something is insane, you know, it's, it's the right level of intensity.

Speaker 5:          01:11:42       So what kind of miles did you put into get ready for it and how long did you train for it?

Speaker 4:          01:11:48       Um, my total a trained about 18 months for this specifically. And I say that knowing that I had been an athlete training just about twice a day, every day for five years at the time. So I had that huge history of being an athlete to begin with. And then on top of that I put the 18 months of training specifically for this. And so the way it would work would be I would run, I would do six week, a six week block, uh, where, um, where I was applying a certain stress. And so my first six week block would be, I was as basically just working on getting long distance. Cause when I was running triathlons I only ever did, you know, five k Max. So I would run an hour, I'll probably run three times a week, it'd be an hour or 90 minutes and another hour and they'd be spaced out by a couple of days.

Speaker 4:          01:12:42       So I do six weeks of that. And then I would do a little test block and my first test block was running the Marine Corps marathon again. So there's one marathon and then I do another six week chunk where I would change the stress and make it a little bit harder. So I would do, I would either run a little bit longer on my really long run for the week or I would block them together, maybe like run an hour and a half Wednesday and then run an hour Thursday, kind of change up the, the blocking. And after that six weeks I would do again and I would do two marathons. And the first time I attempted to marathons actually failed. I didn't, I couldn't, I ran the first one. The next day I ran maybe half marathon and I, and I quit. I was like, okay.

Speaker 5:          01:13:23       Had you already said you were going to run 31 marathons? Yeah. At this point. Yeah. That's reassuring. Yeah. All right. But I kind of knew already one or two, two, two. Oh, I told my friends was like, yeah, I tried to run to and I didn't, they were like, but what was it? What was the failure based on?

Speaker 4:          01:13:43       Um, I didn't eat enough, uh, the day before. So the re part of the reason I was doing these tasks blocks was figuring out first of all, pacing, you know, good with different at different ways to pace it. Does that make sure I didn't blow up and then figuring out how much I needed to eat and figuring out, you know, what it was going to feel like. And so that first time I attempted to, I didn't eat enough carbs, uh, the day, uh, you know, after that first marathon, so I was just totally depleted the next day. So it was like, okay, I didn't, it wasn't a lack of willpower or a lack of kind of ability at that time. It was just my approach at that time wasn't, uh, wasn't right. So I was like, okay, I didn't really panic about that because I knew I Kinda knew what happened.

Speaker 4:          01:14:31       And so like, all right. And so I go and then I do six index, kind of just repeated that for the year and a half, where six week chunk and I just change it, block them together a little bit more, run longer. And then I tried three marathons and I succeeded and it was pretty easy on an easy, but you know, it's, I was like, all right, just three. Yeah, I don't feel that bad, you know? And then I did another six weeks and changing the stress again longer and blocked together more. I rent five and I was like, all right, five. Okay. And I would mess around with a different, a different pacing strategies, different ways of breaking up the Ma, each marathon, uh, taking breaks and that kind of thing and eating different foods just to see how all that, I would react to that. And then after five I was like, you know what, I'm going to, I'm not going to do any more than five because if I do more than five, I'm just going to want to keep going. I don't really want to. So five is enough. I felt really good after five. And then after that I just kinda trained through for maybe three more months, but I kept every six weeks I kept adding more mileage. And so the last 12 weeks I was running a marathon every Thursday. And

Speaker 1:          01:15:47       how many total miles where you putting in a week

Speaker 4:          01:15:52       and that lasts 12 weeks, probably 60 like my, my, you know how they say a dead lifts starts at 135 pounds, you know like my runs but start at two hours, you know, I wouldn't do anything less than two hours. And then yeah, I would do that marathon on Thursday and I would run two hours the day before and two hours of the day after. And the reason I was doing that was this, get this run a marathon. So many times leading up to it that the thought of running one marathon isn't really, it's a norm. It became normal to me. And so I was trying to get that mental to to run a marathon at the pace at your sustained 31 day pace at my sustained, it was interesting. So

Speaker 1:          01:16:34       we run in like eight minute miles, nine minute miles.

Speaker 4:          01:16:38       Usually it would, it would be between eight 30 and nine minute miles. And it was interesting because in the summertime I was running like a four and a half hour marathon of total running time. And so all the predictions I put on my website was like, oh, I'm probably going to finish in about this amount of time. But I had, that was during the hot and humid summer in Virginia, whereas when I was doing this, it was in the fall time, so I was actually able to run faster and people would come out and say, well that you, yeah, you said you're going to be running like nine 10 minute marathon, 10 minute miles, then you run an eight 30 or eight or nine minutes. And it was kind of, it was, what else was interesting was I figured my first marathon would be, I'd be fresh and that'd be my fastest marathon.

Speaker 4:          01:17:28       And so that was in London. It was about four hours roughly of running time with breaks. I would take three 20 minute breaks, four hours of running time, and then it Kinda did follow that trajectory where Philadelphia in New York and Boston were a little bit slower, like four oh five four 15 somewhere in there. And then after I got there, I actually started getting faster. So the next all the way into Chicago, my fastest one was my 10th one in Chicago was three 50 and of running time. And then after that it kind of does level off and I'd be, I'd usually be going somewhere between three 50 and four hours. The human body's amazing. Yeah. And all this stuff that I've been able to adapt to and even I still wasn't able to predict that I would actually get faster. I didn't expect that.

Speaker 4:          01:18:15       And so I mean this goes to show you that the body can adapt to even more than you think. What are the biggest challenges of regular running and running with prosthetics on? So yeah, one of the, one of the things I had to figure out was one of the things I learned and the, my first and second Marine Corp Marathon was that I needed to figure out how I was going to prevent skin breakdown. So prevent, I would run after my first marathon I ran and then I took my legs off and it was this blood. I'd like take the liner off and just blood just shot everywhere and it wasn't all blood, but it was like kind of blood mixed with sweat. It was like, oh my God, what did I do to myself? Did I, I was, I was scared. I was like, did I mess up my skin graft is that thing, because those things can be kind of sensitive.

Speaker 4:          01:19:08       And it ended up just being a little blister like, or a little lights bribed the skin off. And that's like the size of that big. But I knew if I did that ran again the next day and that's going to get bigger and that's going to totally derail the whole thing. So I had to figure out a way that I could avoid getting like my skin rubbing off. And so I started messing around. I wear these things called liner liners that kind of wick the sweat that kind of collect the sweat to, to help with a claim Munis. And so usually I'll put those on and they would go all the way around the end of my stump. It'd be like a sock on the end. So what I did was I cut that off at the end. And so it's kind of basically like a kind of like a rash guard on my thigh and it wouldn't go down to the end of the stump.

Speaker 4:          01:19:52       So I cut that off. You want it to go down to the end. So what my theory was, it's kind of a cloth, it's a cloth material. So what I figured was, and the, and the liner itself is a silicone and I didn't figure that the silicone would be creating a whole lot of friction. So what I figured was maybe that little liner liner, you know, as comfortable as it was, was it was still fabric. So it was probably just, you know, 40,000 steps still rubbing the skin off. So, all right. So I'll cut that off and see what happens. And that was good, but it still didn't fix everything. So what I ended up doing was, I just know from my cycling experience, I'd use shammy cream on my, on your, but you know, to help prevent saddle sores. It's like, well maybe I'll take the shammy cream and put it on the spots that I know tend to get rubbed.

Speaker 4:          01:20:37       So I, I would goop out loud, just take a huge group and just slather it on there. And uh, and that seemed to fit, that fixed it pretty good. And so I was like, all right, so I figured that method out. So that's one of the things is trying to figure it with running with prosthetics is figuring out how to avoid that skin breakdown. Um, and that's Kinda Numero Uno cause that can, I mean you can be as strong as you want, but if your skin, if you can't put your leg on cause the skin hurts so much, then all that strength that doesn't, it doesn't matter. So, so what'd you do with your diet where you're just pounding calories? I mean just eating everything in sight. Yeah. So I approached my diet a little bit differently than most you might expect for marathons. I did a low carb diet, well, what would be a low car for this kind of thing?

Speaker 4:          01:21:27       So I was using this in all my training and all my pacing and all my eating. I did this thing called the maffetone method and it's basically this guy, Phil maffetone figured that you should do all your training at an a robotic level. So he figured out this through experience, he calculated your, he came up with an equation to calculate your maximum aerobic heart rate was 180 minus your age. And then there's other little adjustments you can make to that. So my maffetone heart rate was one 49 and so I see. I'd never ran anything over one 49 you're on a heart rate monitor all the time. Yeah, I had a uh, Tom Tom Watch, uh, and I had one and that my wife has one, so I had to on when I was running my marathon just in case one messed up. And so I ran all, I'm all my training and all my marathons were run at as close to that one 49 heart rate.

Speaker 4:          01:22:21       And what it does is trains, instead of like making you strong, your muscles stronger, it actually trains your cardiovascular efficiency. So when you start out, you'll be running at one 49 heart rate and you'll be pretty slow. But as you do that more your heart and lungs will become more and more efficient. So eventually you'll be running at that same one 49 heart rate, but you'll be running twice as fast. Right? Because it's becoming more efficient. So I just approached it like that or I, I, I kind of figured it'd be better to do it that way because the more glycolysis and the more carbohydrates you use, the more your body's going to have to, they're more destructive to your body. So I'm like, well, in order to be able to run these, I have to run them at a maintainable pace and in a, in a, in a maintainable way.

Speaker 4:          01:23:12       I can't just go out and run as fast as I can. Every single one. I had to pace it. And so I figured that's how it was going to pace it. Uh, keeping my heart rate under one 50 not using those carbs. And so that also allowed me to be able to eat just really high fat. Um, I think I had between 150 and 175 grams of carbs a day and that's what I limited it to. And then I would eat, uh, during the run I would eat three bonk breaker bars. I wanted each of my breaks and they're just like these little energy bars and that would keep me going. That would be my kind of a lot of carbs there so that we kind of keep me going during the run. I would just drink water whenever I got thirsty. And then after I ran, we had pre made these pre meet all my meals and we just made this super calorie dense cheese and meat sauce that'd be froze and we put it all in the freezer and it was just the densest, you know, the calorie dense this stuff you could probably be like, you know, whole containers and cream and cheese and all this stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:24:22       So super dense and my mom would heat up a, a bowl of that for me and I would take a bag of pork rinds and put that in the Chile and mix that in there. And get the whole thing. And a lot of the times before I, before I even ran, I would eat another bag of pork cracklings so I'd have two bags of pork rinds, his big ass bowl of meat sauce and cheese sauce. And then I would eat a sweet potato chips, things like that. If somebody brought us donuts, I'd have a Donut, you know, uh,

Speaker 5:          01:25:00       if people as people could see what just happened to Jocko was I thought he was going to come across. Um, so I'd eat that. And then at the for dinner I'd eat a eggs and bacon. And the whole time you're, you got an RV cause cause you did this in 31 different cities. Yeah. You started off in London and then he flew back to America and then started the grind. New York, Chicago, just going around the country. And you a wife and a little support team was in the RV. Yup. So it was four of us. It was a Pam. Like what kind of Rv did you have? Um, coachmen Mirada, I think it's like a 35. Do you have a RV? 30 to 35 footer, Huh? Yeah, it was class eight 35 foot king size bed in the back. Oh, that's nice. Good. And RVs know as long as you're not moving. I don't know why I sleep like a baby in RVs. I slept well, but it's not totally comfortable when you're driving down the highway at 60. It's pretty bouncy back there. And actually it made it,

Speaker 4:          01:26:05       this is something I didn't expect was it made it kind of hard to eat being in the back. So I'd be, I'd have to eat all this stuff and by being in the back of that Rv for five, six hours, I would start to get a little bit my appetite, we just going to go away more bouncy than being in the front. Oh yeah. Big Time behind the axle and there's so much weight. Yeah. Uh, yeah. So it'd be Pam, my wife, team leader. Uh, she drove some, she drove a lot. Uh, any, I wasn't even, I wasn't really in charge of the were just day to day. Yeah. My job was, yeah, exactly. Well run when I needed to run, when I need to do interviews, run my mouth, do that. And then that was it pretty much. And then, but Pam, she was doing everything, you know, driving, uh, setting up, scheduling all my interviews, working with these reporters and they're like, oh, we want to do this at six 30.

Speaker 4:          01:26:59       Can we make that happen? She's schedule it in and then calling ahead to the venues that we had decided to, to run at, you know, squaring that away. Okay, where can we park? We're coming now. Um, and there's probably so many other jobs that I didn't even know about that she was doing. Um, and then, you know, it's taken on a, a boat load of stress for her. And then, um, my mom, would she be kind of Pam's assistant, she be in charge of kind of keeping me fed and hydrated during when I was running and making sure I didn't need anything. And then afterwards she would make my meals. And then one of her most important jobs was, she's a massage therapist. So she'd give me two massages every day, uh, after I ran, while we were driving to the next place. And then I also had a driver who, uh, who did most of the driving and then he, uh, he just kind of helped out around the, uh, the RV.

Speaker 4:          01:27:51       Like whatever Pam needed him to do something he would do it. Or what kind of people joined you on the runs? I know you said you were telling me yesterday some, some Royal Marines in England. Oh yeah. Joined you got it out there. I mean, tons of military. Um, if I had to categorize, I mean it just people, people from all walks of life and your ultra runners would find out about it and people that ran, people that didn't even run would come out a lot of military. Um, I would say 50% of the people though that came out, I'd say, how'd you hear about this? They say, Jocko pocket, no bullshit. 50. At least 50% of them. Um, the troopers are not playing around.

Speaker 4:          01:28:34       They're doing major support. And then, uh, he has to be a lot of millet. A lot of guys that I deployed with came out and supported a lot of cops, a lot of fire departments. Uh, but you know, it's, it, there really wasn't one niche. It was just even kids would come out. Yeah. Kids would come out, people with their parents, a full families would come out for the day and, and run. Um, it was awesome. I had kids that ran their first ever marathon with, with me, you know, and a lot of people would just, they'd be running their first marathon and then I had a white lady, she's like, well, I'm running a marathon next week, but I'm going to run one with you. And she PB do, you know? And so it'd be all, all sorts of people. I'd come out of the RV in the morning and they're just be people that had been waiting there for me to come out and no matter what. And it didn't matter that morning. Would you start running? I would usually start around seven. Um, unless I had some kind of big interview. Like I had a Fox and friends interview when I was in New York, so I started at seven 30 or eight. Uh, but I would try and be pretty religious about starting at seven and then, um, yeah, people be out there. It didn't matter if it was 20 degrees in Denver, they'd be out there. If it was raining, they'd be out there, you know, it was, it was awesome.

Speaker 3:          01:29:49       That is awesome. What was the, what was the hardest part or did you meet any hard parts during the, during the trip I was there and actually I remember when you were getting ready to go. Yeah, this is pretty cool. I'm like, hey man, like one if you know what if you're not gonna make it, what if you can't? And what I was actually thinking about, I was thinking about your legs and, and I know that, I mean I've, you know, I've got other friends that, that they have prosthetics and I know that it's a, that it's a grind and it rips your skin apart. And I was kind of figured that's what I was thinking. I wasn't thinking like, Oh, you work is going to get tired and quit. But I was thinking that there, there might come a point where you physically weren't gonna be able to do this without, you know, causing massive damage to your body and, and possibly, you know, getting infections and everything else. And I said, you know what, if, what if something happens and you're like, no, I'm gonna, I'm going to finish it. I was like, okay, well there you have it.

Speaker 4:          01:30:43       Yeah. Well, you know, that was something I was concerned about too. I didn't know, uh, how my body was gonna react to it and I didn't know for sure. I never knew even up to the last one, the last mile, the last one, I would never have say I'm definitely gonna Finish this because you know, anything can happen. Cause I could have my prosthetic on, twist it a little bit, and then that rubs off skin on my skin graft and then that causes it to, to die or something. And then I'm screwed. And then I had, I can't, you know, can't continue. Uh, so I never knew for sure, but I've, I, I believed that as long as everything kind of went according to plan, then it was possible as long as no catastrophic events happen. Um, and I was feeling confident. I was very confident the whole time.

Speaker 4:          01:31:32       And then I got all the way around to Texas and I had been really lucky with the weather all the way around. We got to Texas and we're hitting a heat wave in Texas and it was probably, I woke up in the morning and, and uh, Houston sweating, sweating already was ridiculous. I was just covered in sweat. Waking up in Houston. It was like a hundred percent humidity, probably like 75, 80 degrees just to start the day. Houston gets on, Oh my God. And he gets to me pretty easily. It's, it's the one thing like a really slow me down, but I came out of that RV and there were,

Speaker 3:          01:32:15       and the heat so the heat can get to you because you, you basically are missing a couple radiators. Oh yeah. I mean, cause you're your body, everyone's body gives off a lot of heat through their legs and you don't have those radiators to give off heat anymore. Yeah. So you, you, you can overheat fairly quickly.

Speaker 4:          01:32:32       Exactly. Um, yeah. And then my am I, so in addition to not having the radiators, my legs are in cased and carbon fiber, so it's actually bottling in the heat on my legs instead. So, uh, it can really slow me down. But I came out of that RV and Houston and there was just 70 people there waiting for me to run. And a lot of them were marines. There's a vocal, a marine recruiting office that came out and they brought their pool, these people that were about to go to bootcamp. Awesome. And they brought them out. And I'm like, well, it doesn't matter. You know, I, I'm gonna, I'm not, even if they weren't there, I still would've, you know, ran it. Yeah. But I'm like, man, look at all these people that want to run with me. And so I just did it. And then it just, it took a long, I think that was probably my longest, was probably four and a half hours of a running and that was a guy in his regular wheelchair that did it with me the whole time, just real and in his wheelchair behind me.

Speaker 4:          01:33:32       Um, so that was a really tough date. So that San Antonio, Houston, Dallas, we're all really hot and really humid and I had to do back to back to back. Uh, but I got through it because people came out and ran with me and he like kept me going. And um, and then in Nashville, I, it was, it had been raining that day and I was running on a trail and there were these wooden bridges over these little creeks and I had run on wooden British before, so I knew they were going to be slippery. And I was like, all right, I'm going to take it slow over this. And I still, I slipped on this bridge and injured my back. Not at the time, it didn't feel like I ended it at the time. I was like, hmm, that's was kind of a hard fall.

Speaker 4:          01:34:12       And I kept running the next day when I woke up in Atlanta, my back was killing me and it was, I had four left. And um, I just had to gut it out, you know, every time I landed on my right foot is like kind of shot up bad pain into my, into my middle back. And it was a little bit frustrating because I was like, I was feeling so good up to that point. And I had run a super fast marathon in Memphis. I was feeling so good. I was like, Oh man, I'm going to be able to really enjoy these last four, you know? And then, you know, the university is like, nope, you're going to have to earn it. Sorry. You're going to have to earn it. It would

Speaker 3:          01:34:54       cruise these last four days. And then you finished up on veteran's day? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       in, in DC, in DC veteran's day. Um, and my back was fin a little bit better at this point, but still hurting pretty bad. And it was interesting because all up until that point, my, my stumps were feeling pretty good. They had, I started to get these little pockets of fluid on that kind of the outer corner of both of them and they hurt, um, when I pushed on them. And then usually for the first mile they would hurt pretty bad. And it got to a point where my mom had this like Kinda IcyHot spray. She was spraying that on, on the ends every day to help. And so, but after the first mile, that pain would kind of go away. I would just pound them into submission or whatever and they would be like, all right, you're just going to keep going. We're just going to turn ourselves off or whatever.

Speaker 4:          01:35:48       And uh, so after the first mile I'd be good and they wouldn't really hurt it much more until the next day. Yeah. It's like he hears us, he hears this, he's going to keep doing it. Um, and yeah, and yeah, so after the first mile would be, they'd be fine, but on that last day in Washington, DC, they just never turned off. And I think maybe it was because it was that same thing where I knew this was the last one in my body, kind of knew what was the last one. So it was starting to maybe let itself, I would have held on to that last one that maybe this is starting to let itself unravel a little bit. And so that whole last day was just paint in the back, freezing cold. It was like 20 degrees out. And so every time I stopped to rest I was sweating.

Speaker 4:          01:36:33       I was like, you know, I had a hot water bottle. I was all snuggled up with under a blanket and I would still be like cold, but just the sheer number of people that were there. I never was. I, there was never less than a hundred people running with me that entire day. It's awesome. And I had, there was people there that had run with me and other cities that came and came from the last one. I had brothers with me that had deployed to Afghanistan. Uh, all they're running with me. Um, I had for my last mile, I had a, there was a general running, he was out in front, so like were running around the national mall in my last mile around the reflecting pool was that it's about a mile. And so there was a general out front and be like clear the way, clear people out of the way, you know.

Speaker 4:          01:37:23       And then there was a sergeant major who had been my company first sergeant rhythm. So they were running like side by side, no politely telling people to get out of the way. Uh, sergeant major Kent Retired sergeant major of the Marine Corps, top sergeant major in the Marine Corps was running with me that last, uh, maybe 12 k singing cadences, you know. Um, there was, uh, you know, I just had, I had brothers with me that were in the group, uh, their kids, you know, uh, Pam joined me for that last mile. My mom joined me. I had family in there for the last mile. And before we started that last mile like gear I prom, it was like, all right everybody, I'm going to take this last mile real slow just so that we can, everybody can stay together. And then by the end of them, I was like sprinting, but just so pumped up, you know, to be finished.

Speaker 4:          01:38:18       But man, it was so cool. And I've, I, uh, finished that last little loop and I kind of like ran up. There's this little curved sidewalk that goes up to the Lincoln Memorial. And so I finished that last mile. I kind of curve it up to that last, and the whole sidewalk was lined with folks and then they had set up a little, a finish line for me up there. And the whole thing was just lined with people like, you know, and uh, uh, cross a finish line. Pam was there, you know, uh, we celebrated, she cried. I did not cry, uh, to make that clear right now I'm finished, you know, kissed her, hugged her, and then the, then the reporters Kinda came in and started, uh, talking.

Speaker 3:          01:39:04       Awesome. And, uh, do you, you raise money? Yeah. You raised money, a bunch of money for the, I know you support a bunch of foundations, so that was awesome too. That was sort of the other driving force behind you doing it besides just you're crazy, but also because you were raising money for a bunch of good causes.

Speaker 4:          01:39:24       Yeah. You know, raising money, we raised 200,000, um, at the time I finished, I, I kinda, I stopped keeping track, but it's probably like 215 now or something like that. Uh, for semper fi fund tunnel to towers foundation coalition to suit America's heroes. And that was kind of

Speaker 2:          01:39:40       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:39:41       That was what, that was kind of how I almost,

Speaker 2:          01:39:44       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:39:45       Uh, manifested physically manifested how successful that was. And so my, what I was trying to do is this, create that, create a story that people could feed off of. And so when you, when you look at all the stories that are out there about veterans coming back, the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of stories are the post traumatic stress story. Every movie that comes out that is about OIF, OEF, veteran coming home is this pretty much the same.

Speaker 2:          01:40:23       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:40:23       Uh, same recipe veteran goes overseas, they experienced war. They see some bad stuff like you do in war. They come back and there a basket case and they implode and they implode their family and all that stuff. And

Speaker 2:          01:40:41       okay,

Speaker 4:          01:40:42       that's a good, that's a hugely important story to know cause it does happen and it's, we have to take care of those guys and we have to make sure we keep that story in our, in the forefront of our minds. But what started to bother me was that was the only story that was getting told. And I think General Mattis said it best when he answered the question somewhere. And he said, you know, expectations are very strong. So if you, if you go overseas and everybody's kind of expecting you to, uh, basically have pts, then there's a good chance that you're going to manifest that in yourself just by date, by virtue of the fact that that's what's expected. And so you can just going to create that. Yeah. Um, and so what I wanted to do was get this story out there, tell a story where there was a guy that went overseas, had a traumatic experience and came back and was better than he was before.

Speaker 4:          01:41:39       And so that was how I determined I was going to create this story and know I felt that I knew that this was a problem, that this story wasn't getting out there. And also I felt the responsibility to create it myself. And you know, if it's not out there, it's like what I was saying in that I can't a journal, you know, I had that responsibility because it just wasn't out there very much. And so I set out to create that story and then, you know, so if, if there was a guy that was struggling, um, he could see that story and then he could see, you know, what it actually is possible to go see war and come back and be fine and, or not be necessarily be totally fine, but, uh, overcome it and find your new path and find your new mission and continue on and keep fighting for veterans.

Speaker 4:          01:42:25       Keep fighting for your brothers. And if they've, if there's a guy that's coming home and he's kind of on the fence, he sees that story and maybe take some of the the right way. And then at the same time getting it out there for civilians. Uh, there's, uh, a major military civilian gap of Understanding Cause Military Taryn tends to be isolated and on the basis. And you know, that I could see that gap because of all these movies that were coming out. There's every like 100% of movies that came out were the main character at PTSD. Whereas you look at the statistics and it's 25% of non combat troops have what we'll call PTSD, 7% of combat troops have PTSD. And so it's a huge misrepresentation of the actual, uh, of the actual scale. And so I wanted to civilians to see that story. Or here, here's a veteran that came, came home and was, you know, he, he was able to kind of adapter process, uh, what he'd seen.

Speaker 3:          01:43:35       No, I think that's 100% right. And I think you get, you get, you, you nailed it. And Maddis nailed it. Like you set the expectations that everyone thinks that when they go to war, they're going to be all screwed up. It's like that's what's going to happen to them. But if they, if they get told, hey, and, and I mean you, you know, you just, when you came home you were better. Yeah. And like, that's awesome. And, uh, you know, I, I had that conversation with Sam Harris where, you know, I, he'd asked me, he said, hey, you know, you, you get told you, I hear you saying that war is horrible and war is hell, but at the same time you say that it was like the best highlight of your life. And it was, and I told him, and he's like, how do you reconcile those two things?

Speaker 3:          01:44:15       And I said, well, have you ever known someone that had cancer? And when they get, if they make it through, they say it made him a better person and it wouldn't wish it on anyone, but it made him a better person. And, and, and he said, yeah. And it made sense to him then. And, and that's what I think is important thing. And, and you know, look at the, I mean, every war has incredible veterans that come home and do incredible things. And I mean, Charlie plumb when he was on, you know, after being in the Hanoi Hilton for six years, and he rattled off the guys that were in the Hanoi Hilton with him that were, you know, presidents and, and congressmen and just all these incredible achievements. Maybe not presidents, but incredible, incredible achievements. Well, presidential, a candidate with Stockdale, so, and Ann Mccain, right? Two presidential candidates.

Speaker 3:          01:45:05       So, so incredible achievements. And yet the, the media and the Hollywood, they don't shine the light on that. What they shine the light on is the, the, the people that are having issues, which again, like you said, that's real too. But the fact that you made this huge effort and are continuing to make a huge effort to show not just civilians, but also military that yeah, wars bad. I mean, you've, you know, you say you had a traumatic experience, you had a freaking life changing experience, and you've come back and you've, you've proven that that traumatic experience is not as strong as you are. And I think that's the most important message that, that anyone could communicate back to both sides, both the civilian and military side.

Speaker 4:          01:45:55       Yeah. And I mean, there's so much to be said about what knowing something is already possible. So I told you about Dan Kinison last time I was here and back then he was about a year and a half in front of me and he was showing me what was possible for me. I didn't know that it was possible to be able to walk around and with a huge backpack on and using no canes. But once I saw it, it's like, oh, so it is bottle. And it just made it so much easier to do. And I was doing a talk not too long ago and somebody told me afterwards that something that I didn't even realize. Um, I was, you know, how last time I was talking about, uh, finding ideas and that we do that thing called proof the lane and they told me that they just kind of mentioned to me that I kind of had continued.

Speaker 4:          01:46:48       I did in the Marine Corps and I, I did this thing called proofing the lane where I was proving what, what I was, you know, stepping on the ground and proving was cleared. And then they said that kind of that I didn't realize that this is a time, but they said that theme is following you wherever you go. So I'm now proofing the lane for these, these veterans that maybe struggling a little bit trying to improving what's possible. And so, yeah, I'm glad that they, uh, glad that they told me that because that really makes a lot sense.

Speaker 3:          01:47:16       That makes total sense. Then Dan can Austin, who's a total stud, he's about to be in the parallel again.

Speaker 4:          01:47:21       Yeah. Again, he's going to up Yon. Was it Xiang Wisconsin? Yeah. Pyong Chang a South Korea to a, I think he's doing biathlon and uh, the cross country skiing.

Speaker 3:          01:47:33       Yeah. No, he's a total beast, uh, seal, uh, that, that also lost both of his legs above the knee and just a total bad ass stud. Um, I want to read a couple more little sections from your journal to close this out here. We go back to the journal. So when I get asked by people, how could you fathom let alone complete running 31 marathons in 31 days? I give them the same simple answer because I am a marine and my mission to fight for my fellow veterans has not changed. And when a Marine is on mission for his fellow marines, he is capable of anything. Therefore, when people asked me, haven't you done enough, sacrificed enough, I remind them that not only do I have the capability to accomplish my mission, be proud of my Marine Corps heritage, stay faithful to my fellow marines and keep fighting. I have the responsibility, I have the responsibility to keep fighting for my country, my core, and my fellow veterans. So no, it will never be enough. The day that I have done enough will be the day that six marines lower my body into my grave in Arlington Cemetery. And how can I do it?

Speaker 3:          01:48:57       I do it because it is my duty and to do my duty is my honor. In one last little passage I want to read from your journal, it says, I am merely a representative of what is possible for any veteran, any person. So as time passes, I do not want my name to be remembered. All I want to be remembered is the story years from now when people speak about this, I want them to say, I remember that guy who ran all those marathons that one time and their friend will, will reply, what was his name? And they will say, I don't remember,

Speaker 1:          01:49:49       but he was a marine.

Speaker 2:          01:49:58       Well

Speaker 1:          01:49:58       Rob, I can tell you that, uh, I got a feeling that you will be remembered and your name will be remembered and the way that you have represented the marines and America and mankind will be remembered and remembered and revered as well. So thanks for coming on the show again and letting us all know that we are capable of much, much more if we just step up and push a little bit harder.

Speaker 2:          01:50:38       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:50:40       Been awesome having you back on man. It's been awesome being here. I mean, again, I'm glad I could come up with, uh, the material. I was like, why don't you just say you invited me back. I was like, I got our start writing. So

Speaker 6:          01:50:54       stop. No, you don't have to. Right. You got any questions for the man? Yeah, he, was there any time, like during the 31 marathons that you were like, oh, this is kind of lame gob kind of off this? No. Were you ever, did you ever think that, I mean, not even necessarily that you were like tired physically or nothing, just kind of like, you know, it's kind of

Speaker 4:          01:51:17       Tristan, we got, I got, I definitely got tired of doing the interviews. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. But the thing with that is the interviews, you know, I didn't, I wasn't doing this to like to get a bunch of, you know, people telling me I'm awesome or anything. Um, but the interviews, so doing the marathons without the interviews would be pointless because the story wouldn't get out there without doing the interviews. But doing the interviews without the story, without doing the marathons is actually is also a point where I kind of got there. The funny thing is I did this because it was going to be hard. I did this because it'd be really difficult. Yeah. Yeah. And I knew that going in and that's the whole purpose of it is to do something that was hard. And then, you know, the last four days and then Houston and stuff, when it started to get hard, I was like, well shit,

Speaker 6:          01:52:07       was it so hard? But um,

Speaker 2:          01:52:13       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:52:14       Yeah, I like I, like I was saying before, there was never a point where I was like, there's no way I can do this or anything like that. I was like, as long as I don't get severely injured by a mistake, don't get hit by a car or you know, break a bone or something, then I'm going to be able to do this.

Speaker 6:          01:52:32       Yeah. Going to get her done. Yeah. I feel like the air, like every once in a while when I do something that takes a long time, like months or something like that, I get to a point everyone every once in a while and I'm like, what am, what am I doing here?

Speaker 5:          01:52:44       Yeah, it's definitely good. It just, it gets repetitive for sure. Wake up a run the marathon. You don't listen to music, you don't listen to, do you listen to podcasts? Do you listen to music?

Speaker 4:          01:52:55       Did it really on the month of marathons? Except a few times because

Speaker 5:          01:53:01       I had people with me and be like, Hey, I'm listening to a podcast. Leave me alone. You know, sometimes I didn't do that to be honest with you. There were times I did do that. Um, sometimes that Wednesday morning, that Jocko podcast, um, you're hoping for a long one. One of the few people I was hoping for a four hour podcast

Speaker 4:          01:53:23       were, I felt kind of bad in the last four because I told you my back was hurting so much and it was like every time I land on that right foot would be severe pain and then I would kind of make me like kind of gasp a little bit. And so I felt really bad because there's a lot of people that were, you know, they came out to run with me and they were like talking to me and trying to try and help me keep going. But I just was not in the mood for talking, you know? And I felt terrible because they be like, ask me questions. I'd be like giving him the one word, you know, like, Oh, you know, they, but what's your favorite place? Or whatever. I'm like, oh, I don't know. Yeah. And it's, I just, so I wish I could have handled that part a little bit better. And you know, get let those people who I talked to, those people who have it, but I'm sure they understand why. And I kind of said it before and I'm like, listen to everybody. Yeah. If I'm not talking, if it's cause I have this back injury and it's not because I don't like yes, because I hate you.

Speaker 4:          01:54:19       Yeah. So it's that. But you know, when, when it got hard, uh, I fell back on, on my mission and uh, that's what, uh, that's what I was doing it for. It didn't, whether or not I was hurting or didn't feel like doing it was not as important.

Speaker 5:          01:54:34       Anything to do with anything really. Does it vary?

Speaker 4:          01:54:38       I ask you, I want to ask your opinion on something cause I came up with a theory and it's not totally thought out yet like this and this theory might actually get me killed. So please echo, uh, defend to me. I think that there may be something that's more powerful than discipline and what anybody that's listening Jocko reached for the night. And, and maybe it's just that they're kind of go hand in hand. But I think the one thing that may be as powerful or maybe even more power from the discipline is a selflessness. And so the reason I say that is because, I don't know, maybe the discipline leads to the ability to perform the selfless act. But it seems to me like all the discipline in the world might not allow you to do something like lift a car

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       off of your child, you know, r or dive on a grenade. Well, yeah, I mean there's, I think you're actually 100% right on. That's a theory. I think that, you know, when you take guys in combat, we, when, when guys are in combat and guys do incredible things and sacrifice their lives for their brothers, that that is not about discipline and the, you know, they're doing that because they're selfless and they want to take care of their friends. That's what they're doing it for. And you know, there can be people that are, you know, undisciplined individuals that perform incredibly heroic things in combat. So, no, I don't think, I don't think it's a, I don't think it's a, I think that's actually correct. I mean, I think there's, that's an extremely powerful force. And, and you know, that may be the end. And I was thinking about, you know, the power of that where I thought you were going to say when I thought you were going to talk about it was you know, you weren't doing this for yourself, right?

Speaker 3:          01:56:44       You know, you weren't doing this for yourself. You are doing this to get a message out there that you're doing this to raise money for others, for your friends, for you to brothers. That's, that is a more powerful thing than, hey, I'm just a self disciplined person right now. You know, discipline is, is like a, it's like there, it's like they're, they're indifferent. Um, it's not apples to apples. I don't think. It's not like, it's not like this is more powerful than that. No, because I'll tell you that if you want to perform well, if you want to achieve things, like you wouldn't be able to do this for these causes. If you didn't have the discipline to train, hard to eat, right, to get on the path, to stay on the path, you wouldn't have been able to do this even though you really wanted to, even though you really, really wanted to, you really, really wanted to care about your brothers.

Speaker 3:          01:57:29       You really, really wanted to raise money for those funds if you have the discipline to make it happen and, and train yourself and be ready that, that you wouldn't have been able to deliver that just like a guy on the battlefield there on the battlefield because they, they were able to perform the, were able to have the discipline to get to that point. Uh, but there, there too, I'd say they're related. I don't think they're, they're definitely not opposing each other. And I, and in fact I think that if I was to tell you, you know, when I was in the seal teams w the dry, the actual driving force behind the discipline that, that I tried to have myself wasn't for me. It was like I want to be able to perform well on the battlefield, not because I want to perform well, but because I want to make sure I don't let my brothers down.

Speaker 3:          01:58:14       So I would say it's actually like a force that's a foundational force. You know, it's like people that are heavily, heavily religious, their discipline relies on their religious faith. People that are overachievers, that want to accomplish something that their discipline is based on the fact that they want to get that achievement. So the discipline by itself, there has to be that the discipline, there has to be a foundation that that's built upon it. And I think a lot of, a lot of times people build their, their foundation of discipline, the foundation that their discipline is built on is actually the fact that they want to take care of their friends. They want to be able to take care of their brothers. I want to take care of their family. You know, you get all kinds of, you know, I was, you take a a single mom that's working three jobs right now.

Speaker 3:          01:59:03       Well, she's has to be highly disciplined. She has to be highly disciplined. She's got to get up every morning at three o'clock to get to the diner and time to start waiting tables. She's doing that. She has that discipline, not based on the fact that she wants to be stronger for herself. She's doing that so she can feed her kids. She's doing that. She's doing that selflessly so that she can feed her kids. So no, I mean that's, uh, that's absolutely true. And I totally agree. Warning. Yeah. Supporting, uh, yeah. I think the, the best way, the way to get the most out of yourself as a, figure out a way to make it about something that you care about more than yourself. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think that discipline is a manifestation of, of selflessness in many ways. It's a way that you're, like I said, a single mom that's working three jobs.

Speaker 3:          01:59:51       Look, let's face it. She doesn't want to work any of those three jobs. She doesn't want to work any of those three jobs. But she's doing it. She's doing it every day, day in, day out, day out. Why you should do in that she, why is she dismissed showing that discipline and manifesting that discipline. It's because she cares about her kids more than she cares about herself. And that's all there is to it. And you could go to the battlefield and say the same thing. Well why do, why do, why do marines train so hard? Why do, why do we train hard in the seal teams? Why are we doing that? Oh, we doing that for ourselves. Are we imposing that discipline ourselves? Are we having the self discipline? Because we want to be good for ourselves. No, it's because we want to be able to take care of our friends. We want to be ale to take care of our brothers. And you could go across the board with any of that. So I, I totally agree with you. Awesome. Long, glad I'm still alive. No Shit.

Speaker 1:          02:00:40       Could they at any point come into conflict with each other where you got to choose to remain disciplined or serve others? I don't. I don't see how they would come in conflict with each other and if they did come in conflict, I think you make a rational decision, you know, like, I mean, I mean, Hey, am I going to get sneak my workout in? Like what's more important to me working out or, or going on a mission with my friends. Right, right. Or your, I dunno daughters piano recital that they want you to be at, but you gotta you know, it's like you got it. You got to choose between what and what being disciplined with a workout that day. Okay. I be making the recital. I mean obviously you want to make the recital, but if the, if the choice was between making the recital and you have to go to your job and work well, if you don't go to your job and work, guess what? Now you don't have money to pay for your piano lessons in the first place to think about that, that all I'm saying that this is a situation where

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       it discipline and selflessness will come into conflict. I'm just saying usually they're, they support each other and for sure I think you're right. But is there a circumstance where you're saying there is, you could actually become, you could actually focus on yourself and be like, hey, it's more important for me to take care of me, right. Than it is for me to take care of my team and that's not going to go over well with the team and we may end up being, you know, a highly disciplined individual, right. You, you have no, you have no outlet for it because you have no one to take care of it except for yourself. And that's the thing, like you see like the what's, what's the, uh, I haven't watched the movie, but I know exactly. No, I'm serious. I haven't watched the movie. It's American psycho, right?

Speaker 3:          02:02:21       No, I haven't watched the movie, but I know exactly what the story is. The guy is like super highly disciplined. Right? Isn't he like the way he does everything. Highly disciplined, but at the same time, obviously he's a psycho and he's, he's not supporting anyone but himself. Sure. So that's like an extreme version of someone that cares about themselves. Yeah. The sure they're highly disciplined, but you know, being highly disciplined doesn't make you a good person. Yeah. It doesn't automatically make you it. Well, yeah, it doesn't make you selfless and it certainly doesn't make you a good person either. And you could certainly get into a situation where, you know, you get people that are a bank robbers. No, I was highly disciplined. Bank robber. I wasn't thinking bank robbers. But you think, you know the people that are so into working out that that trumps, yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:03:08       Family trumps everything and they, and they have an issue, right. They're so into it that they, that they sacrifice, not even sacrifice. They just don't care. It's a w w you know, when you meet someone that's so into working out that, I mean, that's a very selfish thing, right. Working out as a selfish thing right now. There's part of it that selfless because you're working out so that you can stay healthy so you can take care of your family, you can take care of front. It's like we just talked about. You can take that to a point. Yeah. So you're capable of surviving and taking care of your life, your friends, your family. But you can easily get to a point where, hey, the most important thing is me. Yeah. My pull up, the most important thing is me and my, my numbers. Yeah. My numbers.

Speaker 3:          02:03:50       And you know what, I was danger close to this with Jujitsu cause for awhile I was like, I'd come home at night and my and my wife would be like, you know, this is, I was still in the teams and I was, that was a task unit commander. Like we, I was the, that was the most important thing in my life. But I would still come home at night at seven 30 at night or eight o'clock at night and I'd grab my gym bag and I'd go train Jiu Jitsu and my wife would be like, what the Hell is wrong with you? It's like what are you doing? And that's, that was borderline, right? That was borderline. But for me it was like, Hey, this is a skillset that I should have when I'm on a battlefield so I can take care of myself and take care of my friends. And by the way, that means I have a 1.001% chance that I'm going to come home instead of not come home. So I'm going to do it.

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       And that right there, that's probably a little bit of raw rationalization cause cause, cause selfish the, I really love training Jujitsu. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So there's, there's a selfishness there. And I then I just tried to rationalize a little bit and, and you know, another thing we talked, we talked about the first podcast with you is rationalization and how you've got to be careful of that. You gotta be careful of rational rationalizing everything. So yeah, those are, those are things that uh, definitely can get, can become, can become problematic if you, if, well, that's, you know what, that's why there's a dichotomy. That's why there's a dichotomy and everything cause you can go overboard with any, any personality trait you can go too far with and the, you can definitely go that. That's why I discipline and freedom. It's, it's actually a balance. Even though discipline equals freedom.

Speaker 1:          02:05:28       But guess what? If you have pure discipline, if you remove all freedom, well then what did you just do in sleeve? Yeah, you enslaved so you, there's balance, there's balance in, in discipline. There has to be balanced in discipline. I think the reason that it strikes people to talk about discipline equals freedom is because most people don't make that connection. And most people lean so far towards just freedom of doing whatever they want that they ended up in, slaved from a different direction, which is equally, if not more problematic. And I say more problematic because now you're in a situation where you're slaves, you're enslaved by something that's not good. That's not healthy, that's not positive. Whereas at least with discipline, if you're s imposing the discipline on yourself, self-discipline, well then you're, you're imposing things on you that or at least positive long term, at a minimum, they're positive long term.

Speaker 1:          02:06:20       Yeah. Yeah. Now, can you go overboard with that? Yes. There's people that have eating disorders, right? There's people that have eating disorders. They, they impose such strict discipline that they're unhealthy and that's bad. And that's horrible. You know, I've, I've, I've heard back from some people that that said, hey, you know, I have trouble with eating disorders. You know, it's generally been females who have more trouble with that category and they actually have to use the discipline to say the Dick Correct. Discipline thing to do is to eat more, is to eat the proper amount of calories because it's a horrible, horrible thing. If you see people going through that and it's a fatal disease, right? It's a fatal disease. And so, so again, to your point, there's, you can become so disciplined that it's, that it's negative, it's negative on your personal health. It's negative on your, you know, you can work yourself, you can work yourself so hard, you can say I'm going to be disciplined at work and now you, you stop, you lose the balance and you start stop working out and you stop training. You start eating donuts and you start eating donuts. Not before you run a marathon, but before you sit down in your front of your computer. So they're, there absolutely has to be balanced. But

Speaker 6:          02:07:37       factually the, the tendency, the tendency is I'm going to be, I'm going to be less disciplined and when to do things that are easy, I'm and been the easy path. And that leads to, that's, that's the 80% 90% I don't know what percent, but that is a vast majority of people. Vast majority of people don't need less discipline in their lives. They need more discipline. That's the vast majority of people, myself included, myself and good need more discipline, not less. Yeah. And it's almost about what you're being disciplined towards. So like in the, the situation, bring up with a recital, you have the competing thing. So maybe it actually takes more discipline to forgo your workout and realize, oh yeah, bigger picture kind of thing. People will say to me, like on a, on Twitter, they'll say, if you have real discipline, once you have the discipline to sleep in tomorrow, 10 get out of your comfort zone and sleep in.

Speaker 6:          02:08:38       But yes, so you'd have to look at the bigger, is there a bigger discipline then? Right, because you gotta you gotta you gotta consider your goals and stuff like that. You can't have the discipline to sleep in if that doesn't benefit your goal. Right. It's not even discipline and like the person that's struggling with the eating disorder, they're discipline. At first they were disciplined to lose weight. I need to change that discipline to be a healthy. Right. Consider the goal. Yeah. The goal. The goal needs to change the goal. What a scary thing. It's a scary thing. You look in the mirror and you, you, you, you think you're overweight and you're not. Some guys get that the opposite for sure. The body, this body body Dysmorphia, morphine, is that what it's called? Yeah. So you can have it like you know, you think you're always, you always think you're fat, but you're skinny.

Speaker 6:          02:09:21       And then the other way is like you always think you're skinny so you need bigger muscles. So you see that you get on the juice. Yeah, whatever. Yeah. Asteroids and that's what actually why we're getting the Echo Jocko. We'd like listening or we talked about this earlier, too much muscles. Your muscles are so supportive, man. Juicing and before we started cutting weight shit, speaking of health and support and support Echo Charles, is there any way that you could advise us how to support ourselves, ourselves and each other and possibly we just support you. Support we support, we support. We did actually one of the benefits of having you on as you're very supportive, that encouraging, you know, and I like that. But in the event of people, US wanting to support this podcast in addition to each other in addition to ourselves or all at once, we can stay on Jocko Super Krill oil. I thought I going to say the path or

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       the path. That's bigger picture for sure. And we'll talk about that. But one of the methods to stay on the path is Krill oil. You can lift a lot of weight to get strong muscles. Kind of like, um, like when you tear your skin apart I guess. But if your joints are all jacked up, they don't want to move, you're not lifting nothing. So, and this goes for everyday life. So Super Krill oil, Jocko has supplements. Finally, super crew oil, joint warfare and discipline, which is a pre mission. When he cognitive enhancer force multiplier. Technically what is force multiplier mean is like when you get one thing Jen and other and the sum is worth more than the, than the parts kind of yet cognitive, you're so excited about that. I'm just going to let it roll anyway. Three supplements, right? Not counting the new one that's going to come out soon.

Speaker 1:          02:11:24       So krill oil for your joints. Joint warfare for fair for your joints and discipline. Pre mission. You take it, cognitive enhancers, little bit of caffeine in there, puts 15 milligrams unless you drink multiple scoop. Sure. Then it's 30 did an event the other night and I was kinda tired going into it straight up. I was kind of tired and, and usually my events are during the day, but this was at night as I was kind of like, you know, I had flown out there and I was feeling a little bit site, so I drank some discipline and then I drank some more discipline and I ended up having, uh, I guess it was a total sum total of about five scoops of disciplines. Sure. Too much discipline in this guy, 60 milligrams, but there's not just the ballot. Yeah. But anyways, I got done with the event and Gwen up to, you know, hung out with everyone for a little bit added little dinner thing and then got done with that and then hung out and then went up to my room hotel room. And I just sat there like PTF.

Speaker 1:          02:12:26       And the funny thing is I didn't realize, I was like, why? Cause I had gotten up early in the morning. I worked out the travel, the Bumblebee and I didn't realize why am I, why do I have energy right now? Why can't I sleep right now? This is ridiculous. What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me? What's wrong with it? What's wrong with me? And then, and then I didn't even realize it until the next day, cause I went to bed at one 30 in the morning, woke up at four 30 and then I did like a stretch, came home, Jack Steele. When I got home, of course I got home, did score, which is nice cause my arm's been jacked up so I haven't been able to do, I still, I'm not doing overhead squats right now or even front squats. I am doing front squats with a Kettlebell. Yeah. Just have a bigger kettlebell than other people, but whatever. Sure. So you gotta be careful. Don't have the, if you're not used to caffeine, because I'm not used to caffeine because I only have Jocko white tea, which has the same 15 milligrams or discipline. If you're not used to caffeine, that little 15 milligrams and you drink a bunch of it, you're going to feel it. Don't drink it before you go to bed at night. Yeah. That's my warning.

Speaker 6:          02:13:32       Unless you have stuff to do and let's get stuff to do. Yeah, yeah. Get after it. Yeah. Yeah. You want to balance the discipline for sure. Yeah. You will not. You will feel sharp. That's what's good about it. You feel sharp. Good. It's funny as and mentally when you, or when someone says, boy, I'm drinking the discipline you ever watched? Spaceballs peaceful. I want, he's like liquid shorts. I can't remember. It's like the shorts is the force liquid force he spells is right. Yeah. It was a parody of star wars. The force. It's this shorts, right? Just put it was shorts and then he had the liquid Schwartz or saw, I forget. Anyway, that's how you sound when you say I'm drinking the discipline. You can't drink. You know? You see what I'm saying? Yeah. I think you meant to do that. Nonetheless. You get this@originmain.com on the top it says, labs actually emailed me.

Speaker 6:          02:14:24       He was like, Hey, I can't find the, I can't find the discipline. I said, look within yourself, Dan. I said, the origin may not come on the top. It says labs made like, you know, I'm jumping back and forth. Anyway, that's where you get it or didn't mean.com. I'm also an origin main.com they've got some cool geese all made in America. Rash guards, compression gear tops and bottoms. Rash guards, spats, spats, spats. Do they have the black out yet? I don't have to do all right. You know, also look at the start planning your schedule for the origin, Jujitsu camp immersion. Immersion camp. Yeah. It's not like, it's not like a hardcore, like that's the thing and that's what Pete kind of, what world is what he was kind of telling me where it's not like, it's not like like boot camp or something. Which would be cool too.

Speaker 6:          02:15:16       It's not like a training camp for like an event. You know what I'm saying? Like you don't want guys, yeah, yeah. We're training. We're training hard, but it's more like you're in there to immerse yourself in Jujitsu. You want to train hard, you train hard, you want to learn hard. Yeah. Well, yeah. The case in point, there's a lot of people that have never even trained before. They literally have never trained before. Got Up and said, hey, before this morning's class, I need to get a g g, you know? So yeah, that's an August. You can check on the website for that to come on up. Echo Charles and I will be there. You want to go? Yeah. Okay, cool. Come on. It's like this cool cat. Yeah, you can start learning more than I taught you last time we did. You did, sir. I have Jiu Jitsu legs now. Oh you do? What are they looking at you? Because I told you you got to get rid of like the hard thing.

Speaker 4:          02:16:05       Yeah. They were just that hard sockets. Right. And so what I did was, you know, had I had trouble standing up. Yeah. So what I did was I had these two, I have the sockets and go on my legs. So what I had my process do its cover them and foam and then so that's a little bit softer for people. So I don't hurt anybody. And then he made it so I could just stand on the ends of those sockets, like the same height, the same height. Awesome. And so now I have to kind of, I use them to you. Uh, I haven't started taking Jujitsu, uh, cause I've been really busy. But uh, I'm going to, I think once we get back, my wife and I are going to start going in. Awesome. And then I also use them to do some weightlifting stuff. I've been able to figure out how to do squats off the ground squats and uh, yeah. So it's awesome. So I'll be ready.

Speaker 1:          02:16:57       Yeah, no that, that is awesome. Yeah. Cause the biggest concern I had last time was the uh, the shell had like a Leica and metal valve and that thing was on. Cool.

Speaker 4:          02:17:07       Oh yeah. Jeremy, I didn't realize at the time that you were insulting me because that's how I do not, no, not until after, uh, cause the whole time you were after we rolled, you were like, oh yeah, you're really strong, really strong. And then a couple of times later, it's a couple of podcasts later, you're like, oh, it's actually an insult. It's the, yeah, you don't have any technique, but you're strong. You know, I learned that was almost optimistic to a fault was that when we roll, and you've talked about this before, when we roll, I was like, there's gotta be a way that I can catch Jocko. There's gotta be some way in that guy who was the guy, uh, that's missing his hand that we rolled with. I rolled with afterwards. Yeah. Jeffrey. I had him in, I had him by the neck and I was like, Oh Dang. I got him. I can't believe I was like, got him. And then afterwards he's like, there's no possible way somehow is this still optimistic about what I can do to a fault?

Speaker 1:          02:18:03       Is that, and you're the, uh, you're with so many people, majority of people, especially in the fall, in that category of like, well, and the other funny thing is you'll get somebody with something and then they think to themselves, if I could, if I just stopped that. Yeah, they don't want to be able to, when I had a, I had a wrestler, this was back in the day, I was like a blue belt and, and this blue belt and I was going against this wrestler, uh, you know, like a, a really good college wrestler and the look on his face every single time was just, okay, let's, let's go, let's go again. He was the first person that I realized that that's the normal reaction. But especially for a wrestler because rest of that wrestling college man, they've been dominating people in high school. They'd been dominating people in College.

Speaker 1:          02:18:49       They know, they understand grappling and so when they get, they get like submitted, they just can't, they just don't even understand it. It seems like the one thing they worked on before and you know, and, and I don't know. You can, you can, you can give me some advice on this. Is it better because I've done it both ways. Is it better to submit them with the same thing every single time, which I've done that or to submit them so with something new every single time where they just are dumbfounded. Yeah. I think the second one gets, especially given what you said, because it's true, the wrestler, he's going to have all this knowledge of grappling so, and it makes sense, you know? So you see this one weird thing that you'd ever seen in your mind. You're like, all

Speaker 6:          02:19:28       right, that's weird. Kind of rare kind of thing. It's the feeling and then, but if you're like this thing, this thing, this, and then it's like, okay, this world is opening up now on, okay, I understand. Yes. It wasn't just that one thing, like how you said it, that one thing, I just got to stay away from his or putting my neck and I just stay away from it. So it kind of or, or deviates from that whole idea. So we'll be having these discussions and many more at the immersion camp in Maine in August. August, right before school starts. Yeah. So yeah, those are good fun anyway. Yeah. Origin main dot. Come check it out. Good way to support. Also, Jack talked about his new cool kettle bell that's heavier than my nonetheless. I got the whole set on, you know, you know what Taylor I'm talking about, right?

Speaker 6:          02:20:16       Or the, the primal belts, whatever is I think is like a cyclops in there too. Anyway. Anymore word on the Jocko head or is that that happen yet. Still work in progress. The idea phase on. I'm still, but yeah, that was good. But nonetheless you want the whole set. Put a on it.com/jocko really good kettle bells in their other exercise stuff on there too. You want to switch up your workout. I ran into that the other day. I'm like, Dang, this workout is getting boring. So like just BTF through it and did, did you, cause it's good to, to do things and you brought this up before eve, you're not used to something even though it's like we talked about squats, like going all the way down, which is what I'm used to. If I was to do squats to what does it parallels of the deck, this the standard.

Speaker 6:          02:21:01       Yeah, the standard. Then those squats would actually be a little bit harder for me. Yeah. For like a week or two weeks. And then I'd realize that going down in the hole is the place where you could get, but, and it goes along with exactly what you were saying, how like your, your brain has to do is called neuromuscular connection, where if you're used to doing a certain motion, you can do it way more efficiently, putting more weight on there. And we're pretty efficient, you know, and that's what gain where gains come from or, or a big part of where it gains come from. Um, so yeah, you just, you just change the movement just a little bit. Boom. Whole nother thing. Your body got to get used to more gains to be had. Well that's the whole

Speaker 4:          02:21:36       theory of Westside barbell is, and they change their, the way they do something every three weeks, they either, yeah. Instead of doing this bench press the same exact way that they did that for three weeks and then in the next three weeks they do it. Why do they do it with a different kind of bar? They do it different range of motion. So once you, they don't allow their buy to totally adapt to the constantly changing.

Speaker 6:          02:21:56       Yeah. Yeah. Is Pretty, there's a lot of cool ways you can kind of manipulate that from workout to workout. But yeah. Well that's so yeah. If you want to vary up your workout with all kinds of different movements on it, they have some cool stuff. Battled Macy's or no battle ropes, Macy's, some other stuff on it. Dotcom slash jungle, good spot. Also, when you buy the books that we sometimes review on this podcast, um, I got them all organized on Jocko, podcast.com in the book section. Click, just click through there. It takes you to Amazon. Amazon prime if you have it and uh, you know, get your book, good way to support. If you do another shopping, continue do your shopping, buy that lawnmower you've been meaning to buy. Also subscribed to the podcast if you haven't already. It seems obvious. I know iTunes, stitcher, Google play, Spotify and other podcasting providing podcast, providing platforms also in youtube cause we do have a youtube channel.

Speaker 6:          02:22:57       Rob Jones, I know you're on there. Sometimes we have excerpts. I think that's really one of the main values is the excerpts of first podcasts for sure. Because yeah cause a lot of times, I mean aside from seeing what you and our guests look like, you know, live video version of whatever the excerpts are shareable and I didn't realize how valuable that was with the sharing until when I think it's a gradually increasing understanding of the value overall. Nonetheless, I could go into a whole thing about like, hey could you make an answer to this and make an extra for this and make it, you're just starting to realize that the, maybe they had a reason for that. We'll just say I'm realizing it more. How about that check nonetheless, good value there in my opinion, and a good way to support. Still subscribe to the Youtube Channel if you want.

Speaker 6:          02:23:50       Also, Jack was a store. If you didn't know already, it's called Jocko store. Go to [inaudible] store.com and if you want the shirts that say discipline equals freedom, get after it. The warrior kid shirt like this or they should that Jack always aware as the victory, MMA and fitness, that's where he can get it. That's where you get chocolate store.com. We need to make grey ones of these gray. Just gray. Heather Gray. I don't care. I don't know what gray gray can we do that, but that's a general term. You know gray. It's like you can't just say, hey, you know you gotta. I need three shirts for that summertime that's coming. You got it. There are 50 different shades of gray. There's a whole [inaudible] right?

Speaker 6:          02:24:33       This guy doesn't know you're talking about either. That's the funniest pop culture reference. Yeah, 50 shades of grey. I know. Nonetheless, I'll make the gray one. So there will be a great victory MMA and fitness shirt available on Jocko store.com soon. I like it. I promise. Also some women's stuff on there, some patches and just got the patches reordered so they should be in there, you know, starts running better now. It is. So, you know, take it up. We're happy to hear that. Yeah man. Yeah, it means a lot to us. Some hoodies on there, some rash guards on there for various activities including but not limited to Jujitsu cycling. Um, there was a guy on Twitter, Instagram, I think he ran, I think a marathon, I think. Nice presenting with representing big time with the get after it. Rash Guard. He said he did it 50% better.

Speaker 6:          02:25:29       50% better. There you go. There you go. Factual proof is in the pudding. So boom, rash guard. Yes. Taco start.com look at that stuff. I'm not saying buy something. I'm saying if you want something, get something. Good way to support also psychological warfare. I'm going to explain what it is again. It's no problem for me. It is an album, not a music album. It's a spoken word album with tracks. And these tracks are for, they have a purpose, not just entertainment, like, Ooh, this poetic. It is poetic, but that's not the purpose. The purpose is for each track is to get you through. When you're on the path, on the campaign against weakness, you'll run into these moments of weakness, right? Just little insert weakness, insurgents, if you will. You know, they show up every once in a while. So you listen to a specific track designated for a certain type of weakness that'll creep in. And the track is Jocko telling you why you should overcome this weakness. Why Hi doc. How as well, it's not chuckle yelling at you. It's just a pragmatic kind of in a waste. The steps to take to overcome these weaknesses. Boom. A hundred percent a hundred percent a hundred percent, hundred percent. Uh, what do you thought success rate on that one? In my experience, 100% good way to support.

Speaker 1:          02:26:57       You can also get Jocko white tea on Amazon. It's called Jocko white tea pure. And that's for people that want to deadlift 8,000 pounds. And this is another scientifically proven, factually double blind, placebo, placebo proven. Somebody on or, but I don't want to say somebody's k. There's this guy he did lit, I dunno, he dead lifted a bunch. Oh Yay. Yeah. What's that? Who's that guy? He's huge and he's worn for, yeah. So on the Arnold Classic and he won the Arnold Classic. So I've been seeing a lot of that video to are a lot of people are wanting to test him to see if he wasn't a Jocko white tea. Oh No, you can't. You won't test. It doesn't test positive. Yeah. Yeah. He's, he only did a little bit, but the dead lift. Yeah, he only did a little bit.

Speaker 1:          02:27:56       Uh, yeah. So that's Jocko white tea. You can get that. But that's coming in a cam by the way. It's going to, in starting production, it takes a long time, but by the summertime you'll be getting Jocko white tea and it can like, uh, like one of the other energy drinks that just fill you with sugar and get you crazy. No, this is going to fill you with antioxidants, little bit of caffeine and some good tastes. So yeah, that's common. Let's see, what else? Books, speaking of books on Amazon or wherever way the warrior kid you, you should have that book for all children, right? Is there any children? Is there any child in the world that doesn't need way of the warrior kid?

Speaker 1:          02:28:43       No. Didn't think so. So get that and speaking a way that whether your kid, there's a new way of the warrior kid that is outright now available for preorder. So get it. And one of the things that I would like to do, everyone tells me, uh, things like everyone should get way of the warrior kid. Every kid should read this book. Every kid should read this book in high school, Orrin in their school. People say that to me all the time because it's very simple, clear lessons that everybody should absorb and it would help. It would have helped me if I had that book. It would have helped everybody when they had that, if they had that book when they're younger. So want to get this book out there in two more kids. One of the best ways to do that, if you order way the warrior kid to Mark's mission, order it from different sources.

Speaker 1:          02:29:35       Get it from Amazon, get it from Barnes and noble. Go to your local bookstore and say, Hey, can you please order this book for me? We want to get it spread out where a bunch of different outlets are seeing the demand for it. That will increase the publicity that the book receives and it will get into more kids' hands. That's my goal is to get more kids to read way the word kid and to read Marx mission, so do that. It's alive. I'm also speaking to warrior kids. If you want to support a warrior kid, there's a warrior kid that's a farmer and a businessman and he's making soap from goat milk. Why? Cause he's getting after it. You can order some of that. An Irish oaks ranch.com and the motto, because he makes, he doesn't just make so few mixed Jocko, so hey, he wanted to make good soap day.

Speaker 1:          02:30:31       I quote, I want to make good soap. G O o d capitalized, so he makes Jocko soap. Smells like coconut by the way. Really? As I like to smell of coconut. Yeah. Is there a cool Canadian? Yes. I didn't find it to smell like it smells it dealt with death. You don't think it smells like coconut? Well maybe you have a more sensitive why in a an old factory and the factory sensitive situation. Yeah, but the motto from Taco stope stay clean. Discipline equals freedom field manual. Again, you know, I was traveling around I, I signed a lot of these books and I just traveled around when I was in Australia. A lot of people brought it in and that was awesome. A lot of great feedback. One thing that's good if you have that book and you like it and helped you get it for someone else that you know that that wants to get on the path or should be on the path, so that's pretty easy to do.

Speaker 1:          02:31:24       Also the audio version of that book does not exist on audible.com it exists on iTunes, Amazon music, Google play, other MP, three platforms. It's an album with tracks. Sure. That's why we did it that way. And finally, of course, extreme ownership. The new version of extreme ownership is out look black one, which looks cool. It's got a little excerpt, new beginning, and it's got an excerpt of Q and a from this podcast in the back, which is solid. How long is that part of it? I don't know if they, I mean, you know how much of that is, I think there's eight questions. I mean in there, you know answers, which is pretty robust and it's fairly robust. Yeah, and speaking of leadership, we have a company national on front. We solve problems through leadership. That's what we do. And we do it all the time.

Speaker 1:          02:32:18       It's me, Lafe, Babin, JP Denelle, Dave Burke. You can email info@echelonfrontdotcomoryoucangotoourwebsiteechelonfront.com and of course there is the muster, which is a leadership gathering, a leadership seminar, a leadership conference. What do you learn? Their pragmatic leadership skills so you can win. That's what you learned. We're only doing two this year. We're doing one in Washington DC. You come and May 17th and 18th yeah. Okay. So you can come meet v Rob Jones and then we're doing one in San Francisco October 17th and 18th the DC one by the way right now is already, it's more than half sold out right now. So these are both going to sell out just like all the events that we've done have sold out. So if you want to come register as quick as you can in extreme ownership.com we'll see you there. And until the muster, if you want to hang with us, we are on the interwebs, we are on Twitter, we are on Instagram and we are on patch facey ball echo is an echo Charles. I am@jockowillinkandofcourserobjonesisatrobjonesjourneyandhealsohasrobjonesjourney.com and on top of that, Rob Jones has his own podcast. Now he's one episode deep pool, one episode deep ones. He's on the path. Yeah. The podcast is called used the weight. Yep. Oh, that's good. Yeah. I remember miss the way, which is you see the logo.

Speaker 1:          02:33:50       Yeah. So you can get that wherever MP3 are, sorry. Podcasts are available. I've listened to the first episode. You talk about getting after it and yeah, you talk about how to get through a lot of things, so, so it's, it's awesome.

Speaker 4:          02:34:08       Can I add to that? I'm kind of an advice style. Uh, podcasts right now are people asking me questions? So all those people listen to this, know you're sending question after question to Jocko and he just refuses to answer you this. He reads it and then just throws it in the trash. No, I'm just kidding. Um, but yeah, if anybody has questions, uh, that they want to get answered by me, then send them to me@arobjonesjourneyatgmail.com or through my website or through social media and I will answer them. You just gave out your website on this. That's awesome. Yeah. I'll fight emailing me. Oh No, that's my, that's my special email. That's not like my personal, that's my specialty mail that I give out for stuff like this. Hey also helps to keep it kind of separated. So all my questions, I can just check it on email so you don't get to sift. Yeah. So I have to sift it. Dang. I got to learn that lesson too little bit.

Speaker 4:          02:35:10       Did I miss anything else from your various platforms? I mean I am working on a book too. Oh, awesome. It's, and there's no real, uh, you know, date to release date or anything, but I'm hoping it's going to be a book about veterans, um, and the positive and just continuing to create that story that I was talking about earlier about and telling that side of the coin about veterans that come home and are fine. Yeah. And I'm hoping it's going to be right now I'm kind of making it kind of like you ever read anything by, uh, by uh, Plato about he had basically all of his writing is conversations that Socrates had. Yeah. So I'm hoping I'm going to make it kind of like that where it's just basically this a series of conversations between and

Speaker 3:          02:36:02       two people. And this, I just thought this way you were saying this, cause I think this is another important thing about on that exact subject, and we were talking earlier about these two categories of like the vet comes that comes home and he's good in the vet that comes home and he's a little little bit off track. Yeah. But I would like to say, and I know you're going to agree with this a hundred percent, just because you're a little bit off track, it doesn't mean you're going to get you, you can't easily get back on track or the, I've known all kinds of veterans that they, they were off track a little bit for a little while and then they figure it out and they get back on track. They find a new mission. So you know the guys, and that's actually fairly common in my, in Mott from what I've seen and actually talking to a lot of guys that that went through Vietnam and they'd come home from Vietnam and they were a little messed up when they got home, you know, and they got through it, got over it and got it out of their system and moved on.

Speaker 3:          02:36:56       And again, we've talked about, I've talked about this before, you know when you got done with World War II, you sat on a ship with a bunch of other vets for six weeks and you debrief to everything on a ride home and you got that out of your system and you've got to communicate and you got, you moved through it mentally, Vietnam, they didn't have that opportunity. Vietnam, it was, oh yeah, you're in Vietnam and then tomorrow you're in San Francisco alone. By the way, you're not with anybody else. You're not with any other veterans. D nowadays we do a pretty good job of when you come home, you're coming home with your unit, you stay together, you have people to talk to that have the common experience. But yeah, to the vets out there that are thinking, oh man, I feel like I might be one of those guys that's not on the right track right now. You can get back on the right track and it's, it's finding your new mission and moving down that path towards towards achieving it

Speaker 4:          02:37:42       and just trying everything that you possibly can. Like for me, it's easy to figure out what I needed to do because there was a system in place and it's an obvious physical injury. But with the mental injuries, we don't exactly know how to fix them yet, but you just have to keep trying this. All right. Try talking about it with the therapist didn't work. All right. I try, you know, hyperbolic chambers or whatever. Try this, try that, try that. And because just because you tried one thing and it didn't work out doesn't mean that you don't want to, doesn't mean that you now are fine with, you know, nightmares and stuff. You just got to keep trying everything until everything's exhausted.

Speaker 3:          02:38:20       Yeah. And I'll tell you, I've, I've, in talking to, to, uh, Jordan Peterson, the couple times we've had them out here into listening to him in reading his book, it's become very obvious to me and it's sort of reflective of something that Dakota Meyer said on the podcast, which is like, hey, there's a, your, your, your brain, your, your mentality, your psychology as a system and just like, just like you have a system to move through when you have a physical injury to get healed or get corrected. Well, this is the same thing with your psychological state. And if that psychological state is off a little bit, well there's things that, there's people that know how to fix it. If you listen to when Jordan's talking about the way that he would bring someone through a problem, there's a systematic way to do that. And I never really understood that until I started listening to him because, you know, when they'd send us to the psychologist to debrief a deployment, you know, for me it was just sort of, uh, you know, I had the, the negative attitude of all this, I'm not going to tell this guy anything cause I don't want them to think I'm crazy and I don't want to get, you know, put on whatever, you know, thing.

Speaker 3:          02:39:28       And so I just was, hey, I'm just gonna move forward and, and, and that's sort of my eye and I'll tell you when I was in that was a very common attitude was, hey, look, I'm not going to tell this. This psychologist does know what I've been through, so I'm not going to tell him anything. That was a very common, and again, I think for me, listening to Jordan, because I would have been, you know, two years ago or a year ago before I started listening to, to, uh, Jordan Peterson talk, I never really saw the connection. And then it really solidified it. When I heard Dakota talking about it, saying, look, this is a, I put the two and two together. When I heard Dakota talking about it, like there's people just like, if you wanted to get good at Olympic lifting, you'd go to an Olympia.

Speaker 3:          02:40:11       If you try to figure that out on your, it would take you forever and you might get hurt. You might get hurt worse. Whereas if you went to a real Olympic lifting coach and said, hey, I want to learn the clean and jerk and the snatch, they would say, okay, here's what we're gonna Start. We're gonna start with a PVC pipe, and then we're gonna go through the motions. They were going to get better at this, and they're going to do high poles. They're going to walk you through the whole system. And, and a psychologist will do that with your brain. They'll say, oh, okay, I see what you're scared of. Needles as the example. Jordan Peterson again, here's what we're going to do to get you used to needles. Well when you come back from a traumatic event, here's some things that we can do to, to revisit that.

Speaker 3:          02:40:46       And I think the same thing that you talked about earlier with like movies. I think the part of my prejudice against psychologists came from the way that they're portrayed in movies as being like, you know, he's sitting on this couch and like these weird people that you know, and it's not, it's more pragmatic than that. Yeah. At least it seems that way to me. So it's like a trainer kind of alert, like a trainer and more like, uh, more like a coach, right? More like a coach or more like a Jujitsu instructor that's saying like, Hey, here's what you need to do here. You get caught in this position, here's what you need to do. The psychologist says, Oh, you're having, you're having bad dreams about this. Okay, let's try these things. And I don't know what those things are because I don't know, I'm not a psychologist, but they do know, they do know what to tell you to do and they do know how to help you get through those things.

Speaker 3:          02:41:31       And just like Jujitsu or just like athletic training or just like Olympic lifting, it's going to vary for different people. And a good psychological coach is going to have a know how to make those adjustments and say, Oh, you're feeling this a little bit more. Oh it's because you came from this kind of family, so this is what's going to help you. But you came from a different side of family, so this is gonna help you a little different way. So I think those things are, are important to think about. And again, I've just wanted to reemphasize the point that just because you might be in a Rut as a, either as a vet or just as a human being, you know, there's, there's every little decision you make, you can start moving in the right direction and moving towards a better place in your life and in everything that you're doing. So just wanted to bring that out. Echo. You got any other, anything else?

Speaker 4:          02:42:18       All good. Good to see you again. Oh man, it's so awesome to be here. Just be included among the, the people that, uh, you guys deem worthy of. You know, it takes a long time to do this. It takes a lot of preparation and it's just for you guys to, to take that time and spend it on preparing to have me as a guest. It's a, it's a huge compliment and honor,

Speaker 3:          02:42:41       honor for us. Do you have any other closing thoughts?

Speaker 4:          02:42:44       Yeah, just want to point out that, uh, you know, I'm the one here in the hot seat and I'm getting all the accolades and um, but you know, I didn't, I didn't do anything that I've accomplished without people helping me. I like to, it's kind of like a pyramid. Like I'm, I'm the tip of the pyramid on like the thing that everybody likes to see and that's the top of the pyramid, but there's a whole gigantic base underneath this pyramid that if the tip didn't have it, then the tip would just be a stupid rock. And so, you know, I all the way since my recovery and I've had supporting people and my family and especially on this month, the marathons thing I just did. If, if, if my wife hadn't been there, if Pam hadn't been there, then it's not happening at all. I mean, there's some things that I could say, you know, I cut it, could have done it, uh, but it wouldn't have been as good, but this thing would not have happened without her. She, I mean, I totally gave her the reins. I, you know, set it up and if there was any questions she had about overall vision for what I was trying to accomplish, you would ask me. But like when we had a couple hiccups along the way and I just totally 100% trusted her that she'd be able to take care of it. And she did every single time. And she,

Speaker 4:          02:44:06       I'm sure I'm not giving even enough credit. I don't know. There's probably a thousand things that she did, I don't even know about yet. Um, but I mean, I just, Oh, Hirsch, huge. And then also my mom, same thing, you know, just uh, being willing to withstand a month in an RV with four people, you know, and probably putting up with me being grumpy or whatever, you know, in pain and stuff. And I couldn't even imagine having, you know, two people along with me, the that would have a, made it better or that I would have trusted as much. And then also my buddy that drove a, and then just all the people that kept me going that ran with me and you know, deemed me worthy of their time and the people that sent me messages of encouragement that couldn't make it out. Um, I just owe everybody a huge debt of gratitude and I'm going to do my best to, to continue to keep fighting and earn that respect and earn that, earn their effort or in their sacrifices as much as I can.

Speaker 1:          02:45:11       Awesome. Well obviously rob, it's an honor to have you back on here again. I look forward to whatever the hell kind of crazy thing you do next. I'm not sure what it's going to be, but I'm sure it will be something awesome. And of course thanks to everyone for listening to this podcast. Thanks to the service men and women that are holding the line day and night, day and night, fighting against evil thanks to police, law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics, other first responders that are always on call, always on call to protect us here at home. And to everyone that's listening, I want to refer to one last journal entry that rob wrote and something that we talked about the last time that he was on that was using the weight.

Speaker 2:          02:46:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:46:12       Cause the way to the world can be heavy. The weight of the challenges and the trials of life can drive you into the ground and that weight can wear you down and break you. But instead of letting the weight where you down, instead of letting the weight break you, you can use the weight to make yourself stronger, to make yourself tougher, to make yourself better. And that is what I recommend everyone does. Just like rob says, use the weight. Now, get out there and get after it. And until next time, this is Rob Jones and echo and Jocko

Speaker 2:          02:47:23       out.
