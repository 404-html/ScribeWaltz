Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 27 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink.

Speaker 2:          00:00:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:13       I knew a simple soldier boy who grinned at life in empty joy, slept soundly through the loan, some dark and whistled early with the lark in winter trenches, cowed pen, glom with Krumpes and lice and lack of rum. He put a bullet through his brain. No one spoke of him again. You smug faced crowd to with kindling. I who cheer when soldier Lads March by sneak home and pray you'll never know the hell where youth and laughter go. That's a poem called suicide in the trenches. Bye Siegfried Sasoon. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. Siegfried Sasoon was decorated for extreme bravery in world war one on the western front. He was nicknamed Mad Jack for his nearly suicidal exploits against the enemy. His brother was killed in action in the glibly campaign. He was eventually sent to a hospital to try and recover mentally from what he'd been through while he was there. He wrote a little letter that was called finished with the war plus soldiers declaration where he came out and said, we got to stop fighting the war like this. I'm speaking for the men that are on the front lines in the trenches being killed, and even after that

Speaker 1:          00:02:46       he was promoted. He returned to the front again. He was a wounded this time by friendly fire.

Speaker 3:          00:03:04       That's World War One.

Speaker 2:          00:03:07       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:03:08       and while Siegfried Sassoon tells us to pray, we will never know the hell where youth and laughter go.

Speaker 2:          00:03:19       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:03:21       I do not agree with that. I want to know when I want everyone to know and understand and to see the hell, the darkness that crushes youth and laughter. Then taking us on this voyage into dark tonight is a man by the name of Bob Hoffman that if you look him up, you'll see he's a very accomplished man. He was obsessed with health and fitness and he became a businessman. He was the one of the founders of the York Bar Corporation. If you ever lifted weights in your life, you've used York barbells at some time. Nope. He's often called the father of modern weightlifting, but interestingly, what you won't find much about him is his military service. You don't see generally that he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Silver Star, the purple heart, the French cross of war, the French military metal, the Italian war cross, and the highest Belgian military award. The order of Leopold.

Speaker 2:          00:04:47       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:04:48       You just don't hear that about him, but that was a piece of his life.

Speaker 2:          00:04:56       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:04:57       He did write about it. You wrote about it in a book, which is called, I remembered the last war and let's go to the book.

Speaker 2:          00:05:10       Few

Speaker 3:          00:05:11       people have been able to learn much about what actually took place in the front line, fighting of the world war. They have often asked about the war and it found few veterans who could talk about it. One of the chief reasons for this is that they had little or nothing to tell about the war. Approximately 4 million men were in service during the war. Half of these went to France and of these half a million, we're near the front. 10 men are required behind the front to keep one man in action. Service supply truck drivers, hospital workers, ambulance drivers, guards in the bass ports, the replacement and casualty camps. Many thousands of military police, artillery, signalman

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       aviators, mechanics, and endless more. Our division lost more men than any other former national guard division. More Monday, more men than any other organization except the first and second regular divisions. Our regiment lost more men than any other regimen over our division. Our battalion, more men of any of the three battalions in our regiment and our company. More men than any other company in the battalion. Yeah, we had men who never saw a German who was not a prisoner. Some of our men were cooks, top sergeants, company clerk supplies sergeants, buglers, signalman kitchen police. The men who carried up the ammunition, the rations, cared for the wounded and advanced stations buried the dead. Many one liaison men carrying messages from company to battalion. They fired and were fired at as we fought in towns, woods and hills, but seldom saw targets at which they fired bombs and shells were dropped on them. They suffered from gas and most of the horrors of war, they were killed, but they weren't actually at the front.

Speaker 4:          00:07:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:10       Men who were trained as I was scouting, patrolling observation, sniping who led patrols, reconnaissance or combat advanced guards, captured prisoners, put a gun out of action, held advanced posts, served as suicide squads, and we were being attacked were the men who actually saw war and most of them are dead while 125,000 American dead and France are not so many when divided among the million men who were at or near the front. It is a tremendous percentage when it is considered how few of these men were doing the fighting.

Speaker 4:          00:07:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:48       More than 250 men in our company alone or killed.

Speaker 4:          00:07:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:54       More than the original strength of the company lost their lives in France. They can't tell you the story. I was phenomenally lucky, so I will tell our story. We'll try to tell you something of what happened over there. There have been more books written by other men who were better writers than I more fitted to place what they saw upon the printed page.

Speaker 4:          00:08:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:21       But I don't believe a book about America's participation in the war has been written by a man who spent days, weeks, and months in intensive fighting at or in front of the front as my comrades and I did. There is nothing particularly glorious or beautiful about this story. I've told it as well as I could, but have been able to give you only a faint idea of the conditions we encountered during the five worst days of any unit of the American arm army experience in France.

Speaker 3:          00:08:57       The five days of our battle of fizz met.

Speaker 2:          00:09:01       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:09:02       You could fully appreciate its horrors only if you were there never was a group of men harder pressed by superior forces of the enemy or more ill equipped to fight off those attacks. Then we no artillery support during most of the fighting, no trench mortars, no hand or rifled grenades. Just a moderate amount of pistol, rifle and machine gun ammunition, no food, proper medical attention or the opportunity to bury the dead are men in that battle, the handful who held the front lines covered themselves with undying glory. The telling of this story will give a better idea of what we did in France and other books than other war books I've seen. It tells the unvarnished truth about how we lived, slept, hiked, fought, and died over their scores of my friends. The men I had lived with, trained with, fought with, had come to liken, admire, died in the woods in France. It was only by a series of miracles. Amazing escapes that I did not die to that I am here writing this book,

Speaker 2:          00:10:27       okay?

Speaker 3:          00:10:27       I was young then 19 years of age at the time of the battle of the are gone.

Speaker 2:          00:10:33       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:10:34       I had been too busy to live and because I had not found what a fine place the world can be, I did not mind particularly dying. I had no actual fear of death.

Speaker 2:          00:10:48       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:10:49       21 years ago when we fought the battle of the Argonne, I had 32 ugly Boyle blood boils on my body from eating a diet consisting mostly of meat and bread for some weeks boils, which made me swear more than I have all the rest of my life has. I constantly scraped them on the rocky ground while digging a new hole to protect my body. Each time we halted.

Speaker 2:          00:11:14       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:11:15       I had French itch and copious quantities of mustard gas, ugly burns, which still leave their scars. 12 bullets left their mark on my person or my equipment in the first short battle.

Speaker 2:          00:11:30       Okay?

Speaker 3:          00:11:31       I was one of 32 men of our 250 strength company who marched out of the battle of Fizz. May. I was the only man to return of those who followed me on five patrols that I led in one day in the Argonne forest.

Speaker 2:          00:11:50       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:11:51       I hope through this book at least partially to show

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       the gruesome side of war, barred from the waiving of flags, the bugles bands, the cheering to show at least part of the ugliness, filth, dirt, evil, a morality and stink of war.

Speaker 2:          00:12:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:15       Be sympathetic but remain aloof. Be Strong, prepared to protect our own country against any nation or combination of nations which may attack our homes, our democracy, our American way of living.

Speaker 2:          00:12:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:29       If our country was attacked, the first hour would not pass before I would plan to enlist and millions of other Americans would be in just as much haste to protect our wonderful country and our American way of life. So that's

Speaker 2:          00:12:46       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:47       How he kicks this book off, kind of burning through the intro there, and I really liked the point that he made when he broke down the numbers that how many people go to war, but how many people are actually fighting and it's a big discrepancy. There's a, it takes a lot of people to get bullets to the guy on the front line, right? It takes a lot of people to get that person transport it to the front lines. It takes a lot of people to get to keep that person fed. It takes all kinds of logistics and support just to just to get that guy through the door of a building where the enemy is, and I've talked about this before too, in Iraq, there was places in Iraq where there was basis in Iraq where it was basically like being in America. They had restaurants and Starbucks coffee and Mcdonald's and Burger King and they had pools and movie theaters.

Speaker 1:          00:13:47       I mean it was crazy. Is it where like you mentioned like Burger King for example, do they, does burger king the company kind of make a deal with, you know the government and be like, hey, we want to supply Burger King? Yes, I'm sure it actually, I shouldn't have said Mcdonald's. He was usually a burger king. They must have, will be the ones that had the deal at the time. So Burger King was there on base and you would, we would travel though to outstations where there's some army unit. This is on my first appointment, traveled to some outstation where there's some army unit live now in the middle of nowhere, just totally desolate. Some Marine Corps unit live in in the middle of the nowhere eaten Mrs Everyday. And like there was a group we were working with, one, I wish I could remember where they were to give him some credit, but they were out there.

Speaker 1:          00:14:31       They were on one Mre a day, which Mras and meals ready to eat. It's a, it's a not a very, not a very good way to live off of. And these guys were out there living off of one MRE a day and age. You feel bad, you know, you go out. We stopped that. We, I think we had to stop at their base. We had to get some information, gather some Intel, they knew some targets around the area. We went and talked to him, saw how rough they were living and we went out and hit our targets that we were driving back to our big bass, you know, where we had good food and you know, Internet, stuff like that. I mean it's, it's, it's amazing how good it can be. And that's what, that's what people, some people don't realize about the military as it takes a lot of support and logistics to keep the guys on the front lines on the front lines and not taking anything away from those folks that are doing that.

Speaker 1:          00:15:18       Because that's a hard job. And I've talked about this before, those logistics convoys in Iraq and Afghanistan, those things were hardcore and horrible, dangerous jobs to do. And so I'm not taking anything away, but if you want to say, okay, who went out and hunted down the enemy and got them? It's a much, much smaller group of people, right? So it's like individually, yeah, you got people who did that part of it, but collectively it's just this huge force, right, of people. Yeah, it's a massive, it's a massive force, but it's even more extreme because in world war one, the lines were very clearly drawn. I mean, you had literally had trenches in the ground. And so if you weren't within range of the, of the enemy attacks, I mean maybe that gets some planes to you, but you would, you'd be living relatively safe.

Speaker 1:          00:16:10       And that's his point. And then when you get a little closer to the front lines, yeah, you were going to get some artillery bombardment, but everyone had dug these nice holes in these trenches. So the guys that were actually invading German trenches, most of them are dead. Most of them are dead. It's a small, it's a much, it's one, it's one out of every 10 soldiers that was actually going forward to attack. And most of them are dead. I mean, you could hear what he just said. They took more casualties than the strength of their, of their company was. So they had 250 guys. There was actually a thousand guys in the company because they took so many casualties. That's why World War one is so horribly disturbing and scary to me because like I've said before, there wasn't a tactics. You're your own tactical prowess. One going to help you.

Speaker 1:          00:17:00       You're your own personal skillset wasn't really going to help you. Yeah. You were going to get up, you're going to charge an and really, uh, Bob Hoffman talks about this and he was just lucky. He was a great athlete and he trained hard and he was constantly trying to make himself better. I'm sure that contributed to it all somewhat. But Hey, when you, when he comes off the battlefield and he'd been shot 13 times a one, you know, in the knees, his bullet holes in his canteens, he'd been just, it just, that's just miracle. Look, don't. So going back to the book, he says, we should bend all our efforts toward becoming so strong that no other nation or coalition of nations will dare to attack us. We should build the physical strength of our manhood and womanhood or mechanical equipment, our navy in particular and our army so that we can resist any form of invasion in the future.

Speaker 1:          00:18:04       And I, I put that in there because you're going to see a pretty common theme in the way this guy lived his life, which was to be stronger, faster, better, smarter, always trying to improve himself, always trying to be the best Bob Hoffman that he could be. And obviously that's how we ended up running a giant, you know, Organization for weightlifting and fitness and he actually took some heat for the way he lived sometimes and here they were. They were on the, on the ship heading overseas, heading to France or to England. And he's talking about what it was like for him being a guy that believes in being strong and healthy and smarter and trying to improve himself. Here, here we go. Back to the book, all sorts of men make up an army, good, bad and indifferent. I found myself in lots of trouble. I had been fond of study athletics and work. Went home. I didn't smoke, drink to gamble or go out with questionable women or indulge in other diversions that some considered to be manly.

Speaker 4:          00:19:13       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:19:14       there were men who thought that I was a sissy because I did not have manly habits. This led to a great many fights and I fought at one time. I would have to beat every man in the company individually to prove that I wasn't a sissy. I did get enough practice that later enabled me to win the boxing championship in my body weight class of our division. This experience serve me well on the Atlantic crossing for, I fought five, three round fights in one day. Someone had to do it and the job fell on me.

Speaker 1:          00:19:51       So he was getting, you know, for lack of a better word, picked on because he was a goody two shoes and the only way he was able to stand up for himself, which just to get his scrap on, get his fight on the street edge. Yeah. He was, uh, he was an early day straight edge guy. Yeah. I don't think he had a, the straight edge music going into his head yet that might have helped them out. So they get overseas and now I'm taking you straight into it, into them getting him, getting tasked with, with their first mission.

Speaker 4:          00:20:30       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:20:31       and here we go. Was I thrilled the front at last when asked by our captain if I wanted to go with the platoon, I said, do I want to go? That's what I've been a yearning and aching for all these months. When I was just a youngster, I would read books telling how anxious soldiers

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       were to go into action. I couldn't understand how men could desire to go out and fight and die, but it is something that grows on you. You train and expect so long that finally you become anxious to get into it, to get it over with. Time was short. We went back to our companies on the run. Our company was assembled and I briefly explained that a platoon of 58 man was to be selected and that we were to make an attack with the French at six o'clock that night. My words felt like a bombshell, a brief cheer went up from our company. I asked all the men who wanted to be first in action to step forward. And like one man, the entire company stepped forward. Mandy did. Men who did not get to go on this trip cried real tears, a direct contrast to the lack of volunteering for dangerous missions. A few months later when they had become war weary, then they would go if assigned to any task, no matter how dangerous, but they did not rush in. They became fatalists and said they'd go, if they were chosen, they die. If it was their turn, but they weren't going to overwork fate.

Speaker 4:          00:22:09       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:22:11       And if you, that's perfect. A comparison to the story that I tell in my retirement speech where we had this horrible situation going on in eastern Ramadi and I basically said, all right, whoever wants to go and live in this worst area, put your name up on that board in every gap with their name up on that board. And I'll tell you, this is also accurate in the fact that you fast forward two or three months into deployment after we'd taken casualties after mark had been killed. And all of a sudden, guys, we're not, and I'll use the exact quote he uses here. They'd go to any task assigned no matter how dangerous, but they did not rush in. They became war weary and that happens to anybody. Then I even saw that on my first deployment to Iraq, we, when we first got up into Baghdad, everybody wants to go on every mission.

Speaker 3:          00:23:02       Everyone's all fired up, but as time goes by, you start saying, what are we doing this mission for? What's this mission about? Who? Who were you going after? Fear starts to creep in. Now let's get to the assault. The French men were working like mad with their trench mortars. They kept shells continuously in the air. At three minutes to six, sergeant Felix walked along the pair of Pitt informing all our men that we were going over in a few moments. I urged him to keep down, not to make a target of himself, but he disregarded my advice. Finally, as our watches, which had been synchronized before the pointed exactly to six o'clock, there were whistles and commands and climbing men leaving the trench. All along the line, the gunners who had been working so desperately with the trench mortars to pave the way for us, cheered and cried out to us, evidently urging us to sweep the Germans from the hill. I just couldn't understand what they said.

Speaker 4:          00:24:06       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:24:07       and soon we were in the thick of things, bullets flying merrily. By this time from the German trenches, perhaps a fourth of a mile away, I was hardly out of the trench until some great force pushed me, knocking me over for a distance of perhaps 20 feet. I didn't know what had hit me, but I felt blood running down my right eye. After that knocked down, I forgot the line of combat groups and we fought just as our ancestors. Ancestors had always fought instinctive, rushing forward, stopping to shoot, rushing again and shooting again.

Speaker 4:          00:24:45       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:24:45       so that's like that's you're welcome to combat. Oh, you're all fired up. You ready to go get some cool. Go over the top. The first thing that happens to use, you get shot, which is what happened to him. He didn't even know it yet. All Americans have a legacy which has come to them from courageous fighting pioneer ancestors. The American soldier is a good soldier. He has not had the centuries of drilling to make his own individual self subservient to the will of the commanding officer. He does not like to salute the brass bar unless that lieutenant has a one, has respect through deeds. He does not like to be regimented, turned into a mere robot. He can think and act for himself, and when a battle has passed the initial stages, he's the best soldier in the world. This is going, it's again, reminder, this is world war one, and I say this all the time. People in the military are not robots, and I can't speak too much about people from other militaries, but clearly this was a standout fought as an American looking at American troops in combat. They, they're not just robots, and one of the best things about him is that they can think,

Speaker 4:          00:26:10       okay,

Speaker 3:          00:26:11       now here come a bunch of Americans over on some Germans coming up on their trench. Perhaps the Germans were two startled at the size and evident ferocity of their antagonists to fight well for a minute, but it seemed like a group of big men who had, who had met a lot of boys playing soldiers. One push and the Germans rifle was knocked from his hand along frost, and that unfortunate man had reached the end of his life. I can still see faces of these men. They're evident. Terror. Their astonishment at the number of men who leaped at them from the grass at the size and power of these men, they're evident helplessness. There was not time for them to surrender.

Speaker 4:          00:26:58       Okay?

Speaker 3:          00:26:59       They had jumped up with bayoneted rifles in a moment or two, it was all over.

Speaker 4:          00:27:05       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:27:06       Now this continues. Our advanced troops had passed me by, I could see dead Germans laying here and there right near me were two of them close together. One of them was a big older man with a Prussian mustache. His hands still class for the point in his stomach with a bayonet, had gone in and been withdrawn. The youngster lay all twisted up. He too had been bayoneted and it seemed that his bones were broken from the strokes of the butt of a rifle. A rifle is a wicked weapon when swung by a powerful man and there were many strong men in action that day. It's, you know, you hear about bayonet fighting,

Speaker 4:          00:27:51       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:27:52       But to think about it on this scale where this is, this is looking more like a scene out of Braveheart at this point than it is looking like a modern war. People clubbing each other to death and stabbing each other bay in that range.

Speaker 3:          00:28:11       The Germans weren't giving out, giving up without a real struggle. We had let her read a lot about chained machine gunners, but these men weren't chained and they were fighting to the bitter bitter death. Now that chain machine gunner, this is like a rumor that happened. The deep American's would here because the Germans had a machine gun and it was a big heavy sort of a medium weight or heavyweight machine gun I think is a mg Oh eight and and it was so heavy that they put this big sling on it and on the sling it was a made of leather, but they had to reinforce the leather with chain and so when they find these soldiers dead with these machine guns and the the chain would clip into their gear. The rumor was that these guys had just been chained to their machine goes, you can't leave. You're just going to stay here and fight to the death. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:29:04       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:29:05       Our men were coming back to the book are men. We're constantly rising and falling. Some of them never to rise again. Our ranks were becoming rapidly decimated and there were few of us still going forward at this point. I have never seen an authentic list of the casualties of a company that day, but I know this. I never saw a single one of those 58 men of our company who went over the top that night. Again at the front.

Speaker 3:          00:29:37       I had been hit several times once on the left knee. Once on the right knee, either bullet could have left me crippled for life, but both glanced off the bone leaving only a scar which is noticeable to this day. One grazed my arm leaving a scar at present an inch long and three quarters of an inch wide. I had a variety of feelings as these bullets struck or scratched me. The first which hit my helmet gave me the same sensation as if I had been pushing as if I had been pushed by a gigantic hand. The bullets on the knees stung luck. I had been hit with a whip and the bullet that cut through the arm and the one which left its mark on my face felt like a drop of hot water. It hit me about this time the battle would become very hot. We fired at every enemy we could see. And they were firing from every direction from the front left and right. And even from behind because we'd gone so fast that we had not dropped the snipers who were firing at us from the trees caught in the little 360 degree field of fire by the way, caught in a 360 degree field of fire after you've been shot. What, five times.

Speaker 4:          00:30:57       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:30:58       We talked about lucky obviously better to be lucky than good at this point. It's crazy how he w w how he described getting shot. You know how you'd almost think that Dang you get shot. That'd be so painful. But when you're in the heat of things, and I think it happens so fast that it like your nerves don't pick up on the, the, the destruction. It depends where you get shot. Yeah. It depends on where those rounds hit. And I remember actually even here in guys from Vietnam, guys from seals, from Vietnam told me, um, one guy told me a story that the first time he got shot, they were out on an operation, came back. He was literally heading out to the bikes. Are you actually, you said he was in the bar and he realized he was bleeding and you look down and he'd been shot somewhere in the abdomen.

Speaker 3:          00:31:47       But you know, obviously it wasn't that bad, but he had been shot. Um, yeah. And it, it can, it, you can, you can catch a bullet in the wrong place and it's game over or you can catch a boat in the wrong place and you can just take you off your feet or you can catch a ball in the wrong place and your arm won't move anymore. Or they'll be massive amounts of pain or you can catch a bullet in the right place and it goes through and through. It goes in and out very quickly, doesn't hit anything vital. And you know, you're just kind of lucky as far as the pain goes. You think, you know it's the same thing. You're right. Sometimes it goes through and through and guys barely even notice it. Right. And sometimes if it hits the wrong spot, it hits a bone or whatever. I mean it's, it's like a ricochet massive pain. Like I hear stories about, um, it's, it's going to sound

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       kind of good tests, but like grills will get stabbed in the back or something and there'll be like, oh, it felt like, I'm thinking of a particular story I heard where girl got stabbed by an attacker in the back and she was like, Oh, I, it felt like he was just eating me with his fist on my back. And then I felt the warm blood going down, you know? And then later on they found out, it's like, I don't know, it's weird. It's like it happens so fast or something combined with adrenaline, you don't feel that the destruction part of it, you know? And it depends what it hits. And it does depend on what it hits. That's crazy sentence. Felt like hot water that, you know.

Speaker 3:          00:33:14       Yeah. Actually I had a guy, one of my guys got shot. He was out, you know, firefight going on and all of a sudden he's, he feels the hot,

Speaker 5:          00:33:24       you know, the hot kind of dripping down his back, hot liquid, dripping down his back. And it turned out he had just been shot in the camel back in the camel camel back. You know, those, they're like thermoses, they're like a, they're soft canteens you wear when you're back and it was hot out. So the water up and you started off, he shot, he thought he got shot, but it actually just hit his game while back. I remember my toenail fell off right in, in training that I stubbed that on a corner and I almost passed up. So you kind of consider the destruction, you know, you kind of compare them. It's almost like taking a bullet would be less painful then ripping out echoes toenail. Well, it was my toenail got ripped off and then so it was jacked up for a few days and then I stubbed that on the corner of uh, I think it was like, well you got a bunch of nerves in your toes.

Speaker 5:          00:34:18       That's where he got fingernails or toenails. And again, the most important thing is where, you know, what does that, what does that bullet hit? What does that blade hit? What does it do to you? Yeah. Does it hit the, does it hit a nerve or not? Yeah, and the adrenaline because when I got my tone, no ripped off, he would hit at this weird angle where it just peeled back my whole big toenail and it didn't really hurt that much because I was rolling, you know, the adrenaline and stuff. But if I just sat there and said, Hey Jocko, peel back my toenail like that, it probably hurt way more. It would hurt way more because you'd be in fallen. Alright, here we go. Back to the book. The for Raiders

Speaker 3:          00:34:58       of machine guns of any sorts are targets for all rifleman's. Their vulnerability in action gave rise to the term suicide squad. Sergeant Felix called to one of the runners to bring him the gun. The runner dropped dead as he handed the gun to Felix. We advanced the German third line trench fighting desperately meanwhile, and driving the Germans before us. I had not reached any of them with my bayonet, but had been doing the deadly work with my rifle as we rushed to the German trench expecting to jump down into it and fight hand to hand with the enemy. We saw that we could not do this. The trench was covered thoroughly with barbed wire so that nothing much larger than a hummingbird could get in. We laid down outside the pair of Pitta fire at close range. Someone shouted, look out, there's a bomb. It went off. It went right off in my face, but all my parts seem to be present immediately afterwards. I saw Felix lying there sprawled out groping for his pistol. I said, what's the matter bill? He couldn't answer, but turned weekly to me and I saw that half his face seem to been torn off.

Speaker 3:          00:36:16       I picked up the automatic rifle and as I turned it into the German trench, they got up and ran back. I was the only one firing. I saw many of them drop with a 60 shots a minute. I was pumping it down. So I knew I was getting enough of the enemy to make up for our men who had been killed and wounded for a time and there was nothing to shoot at. So I took stock of the situation so far back that they were hardly more than specs. I saw tiny men in blue dicking in. It must've been all of a half a mile. I knew that we should not stay out here in such an isolated post, but what were we to do? I never thought for a minute of abandoning the wounded. So there we stayed. The snipers far off in the wood. We're still firing at us and there was no way we could reach them or entirely escaped their bullets. I couldn't get into the trench, so I call it crawled around it well over into the woods. Shell holes everywhere. I saw for the first time what have it could be wrought by shell fire at places. The show holes were connected solidly to each other. The trees and bushes were shattered. Men were blown up and blown up again. They were in pieces. It would have taken a Bushel basket or a Gi can two of gather up all those Germans for burial.

Speaker 3:          00:37:40       I admit that they were the finest of soldiers after four years of war. They fought to the death before we, before they would give up a position. They were so well trained that it was second nature with them. They had been regimented for so long, but they never questioned in order put up with all sorts of privation suffering and we're cheerful through it all. The majority of them were in very good condition. When captured it showed they could take it. I often wondered if our own men could be as good soldiers after four years of war. All of us could not be brave. Bravery is a sort of fixed quality, something that some men's have, some men have and others do. Not. Only physical collapse or death stops the brave.

Speaker 3:          00:38:31       Some will be brave when they must win. They like mother animal are driven by this instinct of self preservation to protect their own lives or that of their offspring. A man who naturally has courage is fortunate. It is the ability to control his mind, to prepare it so that he feels nothing. Courage is the product of physical strength and mental strength. Combined. Proper training will make men more courageous and certainly these Germans were courageous, physical strength and mental strength combined. That's where that courage comes from. Back to the book, I tried to do something for the wounded. They were very cold by this time, suffering from loss of blood. They were lying there stripped to the waist. I reached for the canteen of one of the dead men. There were two bullet holes through mine and it was an empty. Just as I turned a bullet from a far off to the left toward through the flesh of my cheek.

Speaker 3:          00:39:41       Had I not turned at that very instant, it would have gone through my head dead center killing me or sadly may me me for life little vote Shona who laid there was just 16 years of age. He was the first of a dozen youngsters whose ages range from 14 to 16 who would have listed in our company. They had lied about their actual age, uh, neighbored with the appearance of our fellows in uniform. They too wanted to be soldiers. Some of them lost their nerve before they reached the front and tried in many ways to get out of service. The Spencer Brothers 15 and 16 years of age were to be killed by shell fire. There was no fear in this little Italian boy. He's talking about little vote Shona. He'd always been a hot tea hothead, wanting to fight with a knife, fork or anything he could lay his hands on when someone antagonized him a bit. He was dashing forward with bayoneted rifles in hand so fast when the bullet which killed him, which hate him, that he lay out well on the Barb wire covering the German trench kids 1415 and 16 years old.

Speaker 3:          00:41:11       I don't, I'm not saying anything bad about our current state in America, but I have a hard time picturing the current brood of 1415 and 16 year olds getting their trench warfare on 1415 and 16 years old.

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       Face to face with the Germans.

Speaker 4:          00:41:39       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:41:40       Back to the book. I crawled back and there was one of our men crying. I asked him why and he replied that so many of his friends had been killed. I told him not to worry about the killed that we had living wounded, to be concerned about to get back, that he'd better go for help and stretchers and see if we could not evacuate our fellows. I had no other thought then that I should die as bravely as I could for my friends or country or something. So I prepared to sell my life as dearly as possible. In a surprisingly few minutes, there came a crashing through the woods, the sound of voices and a large body of men came into view. I lay, still waited until they were close and then jumped up pointing my automatic rifle at them and it was prepared to go into action. I suppose it was a very startling to have a dead men jump up for, I certainly looked dead. I pulled the trigger and as soon as one man fell, the other roles, the others all shouted comrade. It's like holding up a train. No one wants to be the first killed. So a crowded car permits a one man to hold it up.

Speaker 3:          00:43:04       When the Germans found that I had stopped firing, they were anxious to surrender. There officer was as nice and polite as any headwaiter in a high class restaurant.

Speaker 4:          00:43:14       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:43:15       he knew a little English and understood. And when I told him to have his men pile the arms in one place, put their packs and another and make improvised stretchers to carry back the wounded.

Speaker 4:          00:43:25       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:43:26       This all took her just a few minutes and soon we were starting back. So the tough Germans, he ended up capturing a bunch of Germans and he actually actually makes a funny comment here that he says that as he was walking back with all these Germans that he had captured, a couple of the guys now helped him once he got off the front lines and he says that his award says that he had assisted in the capture of 38 Germans and he can see he's kind of upset about that cause he did it by himself. He didn't assist. He got the whole thing done.

Speaker 4:          00:44:05       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:44:07       And now he ends up, because the wounds that he suffered, he ends up in the hospital. Then he starts having faults and explaining what it's like being in the hospital and the people that are in there with them. Youth of all nations seldom reckons the cost.

Speaker 4:          00:44:26       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:44:26       They make the best soldiers because they will go out and try to die bravely for their, as I expected and tried to do. Older men are more cautious. They have homes, perhaps families positions they know about life. They usually know the folly of war. They are careful and battles are not won by being careful.

Speaker 4:          00:44:52       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:44:53       The impetuous youthful soldiers are the best fighters. That's why war will always take the flower of the manhood of the nations involved the strongest, most intelligence, most of useful of men.

Speaker 4:          00:45:09       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:45:11       Now he starts talking about what happens. He's again still in the hospital trying to recover from the wounds he's, he has his wounds obviously aren't as bad as some of the other wounded that he's in there with.

Speaker 4:          00:45:24       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:45:25       Back to the book. When a man was dying, they would move him out. It was not, it was bad enough for him to die without his comrades who did not know when their own turn might come, having to watch him die. Some of the men went out screaming when they were moved. The nurses would try and ease their going by telling them that they were only going to the operating room for minor treatment or to the dressing room to have their bandages changed. The fellows soon learn to observe whether the little bag, which held their personal belongings. Sometimes a helmet or a coat came with them.

Speaker 4:          00:46:09       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:46:10       If it remained behind, they could expect to come back, but if it too was moved, then they were sure that worst was in store for them.

Speaker 4:          00:46:19       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:46:19       Some beg to be left there to die with their friends around them, not to be placed with a lot of near corpses who were complete strangers. The more pitifully wounded did not wish to live. They constantly begged doctors and nurses sometimes at the top of their voices to put an end to them. Some made attempts to end their lives with a knife or fork. He became necessary to feed these wounded and never leave a knife or a fork with them are blinded man who is suffering greatly and did not wish to live, had killed himself with a fork. It was hard to drive it deep enough through his chest to end his life and he kept hitting it with his clenched fist to drive it deeper. That is, I guess about as bad as it gets when you have individuals that survived combat butter and such a wretched state

Speaker 4:          00:47:37       that

Speaker 3:          00:47:38       no soldier killed himself with a fork.

Speaker 4:          00:47:46       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:47:48       they know what of one of my guys, one of my buddies, Ryan job, he, he got blinded the in both eyes after he took around to the, to the face.

Speaker 4:          00:48:01       And

Speaker 3:          00:48:02       it really does show you, I mean, I would talk to him on the phone when we were still over there and just, his attitude was so indomitable. His spirit was so strong. And I'll tell you something else, he had been sent to at one point, he was sent to the place where they have the guys that have had traumatic brain injuries, who are having trouble with their thoughts and with their motor skills and guys that are in really bad shape. And when he was there, and I talked to him on the phone, he spent about a week there, Teddy told me, you know, hey, I'm moving. I'm a, I think, I think he'd, he'd already left, but he said, basically told them, hey, get me outta here. I don't need to kind of help with these guys needs. I'm taken up someone's bed. So even though he was blind, and of course he was a tough bastard, but I mean tough bastard or not, he was blind. I mean that's a game changer obviously, but he still looked at the guys that were wounded worse than him and was like, Hey, I don't want to take up anybody's bed. I'm good. I'll be okay. I can't see, but I'm good. Did you say you went to come back to oh yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah. He, he was like telling me, just let me come back. Let me come back and I can, I can, I can stand watch cause I can smell them.

Speaker 3:          00:49:43       And unfortunately he didn't get a chance to go back. So now there's a, them, the Germans had made a drive for, for Paris and the Americans were now involved in a counter attack and Bob Hoffman is still in the hospital and now the wound it start coming in from this counter attack. The wounded that came in now were particularly serious cases. Men who had been wounded by tremendous shells. There was much screaming in anguish displayed by the solely wounded men.

Speaker 4:          00:50:27       Seldom

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       was it quiet at night, man who's nerves broke would be screaming all night. There were many cases of shell shock men who had had their maniacal moments when they felt that they were still at the front being subjected to shell fire. They were out of their minds and there was nothing that could be done about it. But it made it most unpleasant for the other wounded, horrible cases of mustard gas. We're everywhere. Some of these men were blinded and had to lie for endless days. Would their heads covered with bandages? Some of the men were able to walk, sprayed a legged down the isles. I was told that their testicles had in some cases shriveled up like dry peas in a pod. They were certainly in a bad way. So the mustard gas,

Speaker 4:          00:51:36       it

Speaker 3:          00:51:37       attacks the softest part of your tissues, right? So your eyes, your nose, your testicles, like anywhere where there's moisture and softness.

Speaker 4:          00:51:51       And

Speaker 3:          00:51:52       on the 21st of July, the doctors decide that he's fit to go back to the front. He gets on a train queue. Imagine you go, you fight this battle, you get wounded and you come back. You're watching guys come in that are severely wounded, shell shock, mustard gas, and then they say, okay, by the way, now you're good to go. We're going to send you back out to the front like you think you got that million dollar wound that we talk about and a bunch of these episodes where people say, oh, I made it off the front. He goes off the front for, I don't even think it's a month, I think it's a few weeks and now you're fit for duty again, back to the front, back to the front, back to the meat grinder and he'd goes there by train and a surprisingly short time at about two o'clock we were close enough to the front that we had started to see the dead soldiers of both armies along the way. The American soldiers had been buried hastily and holes they had dug along the road as they were advancing, but there were still many of them laying in the fields. I could see their khaki uniforms and they're white faces as we passed.

Speaker 3:          00:53:04       There are two chief reasons why a soldier feels fear first that you will not get home to see his loved ones again, but most of all picturing himself in the same position as some of the dead men we saw.

Speaker 3:          00:53:19       They laid their face up usually in the rain. Their Eyes Open. Their face is Pale and chalk. They're gold teeth showing that is in the beginning. After that, they are usually too horrible to think about. We buried them as fast as we could. Germans, French and Americans alike, get them out of sight, but not out of memory. I can remember hundreds and hundreds of dead men. I would know them now if I were to meet them in the hereafter, I could tell them where they were laying and how they were killed, whether boots, Shell, fire, gas, machine, gun or bayonet.

Speaker 4:          00:54:03       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:54:04       In the beginning we had a fear of the dead. We hated to touch them. Some of the hardest experience of my life, we're taking the identification tags from my dead friends. The first dead man I touched was Philip Becket ditch, an Austrian Baker who is with our company. I tried to save his life by carrying him through heavy enemy fire and putting them in one of the sellers of the French houses. He was shot in my arms as I carried him.

Speaker 4:          00:54:35       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:54:36       A few hours later I found time to go round and find how he was. He was dead, stiff and cold.

Speaker 4:          00:54:46       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:54:46       I had to remove his identification tags and they slipped down between his collar bones and the flesh of his chest. They were held there and it took an effort to get them out. I thrilled and chilled with horror has I touched him. It was hard to touch these dead men at first. My people at home hearing of what I was passing through expected me to come back hard, brutal, callous, careless, but I didn't even want to take a dead mouse out of the trap. When I got home. You had over there. I buried 78 men one morning. I didn't dig the holes for them of course, but I did take their personal belongings from them to return to their people, their rings, Trinkets, letters, and identification tags.

Speaker 4:          00:55:39       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:55:40       You hear these days, you know, people will talk about seeing a dead body and how that's a traumatic experience. And as a matter of fact, my son, uh, he has, he found a dead body one down on the beach and one guy fell off the cliff and by my house I saw that in the news, but right, right, right. And you know, people were saying, Oh, you know, you should, you should, you know, make sure you talk about it with them and make sure he's okay and all that, you know, great. You're concerned. But can you imagine, I mean, you're just seeing dead body after dead body after dead body, after dead body, after dead body, after dead body, it goes on and on and on.

Speaker 6:          00:56:27       Yeah, like that kind of, this kind of,

Speaker 5:          00:56:33       if you're in that environment, sometimes it could, you could have that kind of desensitized, you know, feeling. But I would imagine you would really come to get you after everything calms down. You know, like, like how he was saying he, he didn't even want to take a mouse out of the child dead mouse because it's a reminder in this calm environment or reminder of just all that death, you know? But at, yeah, at the time it seems like they're almost like there could be two kinds of reactions to it where they either get used to it or get tired of it kind of thing. And then so if you get tired of it, it was just way on your way, on your way on you. But if you get used to it, it just gets less and less impactful, you know? Yeah. Well obviously they had to deal with it.

Speaker 5:          00:57:16       They had to detach from it. You couldn't, I mean, it's just like you talked to a doctor that's been in practice for a long time. Eventually they cannot get emotionally attached to every patient as they had. Or they would go completely insane. They wouldn't be able to do the job. And it's the same thing here. Obviously you can't get emotionally attached to every single body that he's dealing with. But you can tell that it leaves a mark. Yes, fully. And, and you'd think that, I mean, the doctors, the good little analogy, but the thing that the doctor has, and I was talking to Luke, you know, Doctor Luke here, we're talking about it. Um, jade asked him that question like, it does it ever weird you out when you, you know, you're operating on somebody or whatever. And what doctors get is this sense of, okay, so the not only the job, but it's almost like working on a car, cause you kind of know all of the little working parts and you can fix them, fused them together and boom, it works.

Speaker 5:          00:58:03       Now, you know, kind of still there's that element of thinking. Um, and then, yeah, sure. On the other side it's a person. And if you know the guy, you know, it might even be more personal, but in war it seems way more dark because the guy's not supposed to be dead. The, you know, the goal is to live and to win the war. Death is literally like the worst case scenario for the person or one of them. So when you see someone dead, it's like man, it's not, it's part of the job, but it's not the, the, the outcome that you're, the goal, you know, it's no part of the goal is to die ever. It's like the bad part. So it can't be substituted with, Hey, you know, that you can't substitute your thinking in regards to this dead person with, you know, part of being part of my goal of my job, you know, all I will say that, you know, when you've got at least we had a, we have a volunteer military service and everybody that joins up,

Speaker 6:          00:59:01       okay.

Speaker 5:          00:59:01       No. So that's part of the risk of the job. So at least, even though that's obviously not the goal, you know, that guys have at least come to grips with the reality that, that that's what they may face. Yeah. Fully. Kind of like if you're a fighter in the gay, uh, you know, getting knocked

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       out, seen a guy get knocked out or broken leg or something like that, it's weak. It's part of the game, you know, but um, obviously way, not quite as heavy as the war situation. Yeah. So speaking of which, back to the book, here they are, he's now just fighting and he's with another guy named Vaughn and Vaughn kind of pokes his head up above this barricade and start shooting and he's kind of looking at it, I'm thinking that seems pretty dangerous. But he sees Vaughn getting away with it. So he gets up there too and starts shooting and soon there they're firing shots. And then back to the book here. But after several shots each, I suddenly saw Vaughn's helmet go sailing down over the slight hill. I looked at him and the entire top of his head was off apparently a dumb dumb type bullet, one in which the lead had been cut so that it would spread in the instant struck during a terrific hole in the object it hit, had flattened against his helmet or tin hat and had taken, is taken off his head to a level with his eyes and ears.

Speaker 3:          01:00:34       He had been kneeling and his buttocks went back a bit his head forward. And his brains ran out there in front of me, like soup from a pot.

Speaker 2:          01:00:43       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:00:44       I did not fire over another wall. The sniper had his choice to pick one or the other of us for some unknown reason. He chose Vaughn. I'm here and he's gone. Von Lay there for a couple of days. Finally, he was carried down and stored in the room where we had the other dead piled up like logs of wood, but he had to have his own place in the corner. It was gruesome enough.

Speaker 2:          01:01:23       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:01:25       The nerve strain of the constant gas attacks was severe. We were wakened up at every hour of the day and night to stand too in preparation for an attack to prepare to move on, or at least put our gas masks on, but now they're getting ready to do another assault. One of the greatest barrages into history. The war was being put over the earth and the air constantly trembled with the force of explosions. Each flare would show us the details of no man's land, no man's land between the lines dead men were laying everywhere in the most grotesque positions. Some of them lay as if sound asleep. One man's head rested so comfortably on his arm that I could not believe you is dead. Others had been blown to pieces several times and some were just arms and legs or torsos. This night approach to the front made us sick.

Speaker 4:          01:02:31       Okay?

Speaker 3:          01:02:31       As we finally found the men we were to relieve, we were all thoroughly sick. The ground was rotten with tear and vomiting. Gas, mustard gas too was all around. War is bad enough without the constant torture of gas.

Speaker 4:          01:02:50       Okay?

Speaker 3:          01:02:50       There was a constant cry for stretcher bearers for the Red Cross, the most diabolical screaming and moaning that could be imagined.

Speaker 4:          01:02:58       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:02:59       Human beings lying helpless. No way to fight back not knowing who would be killed by the next shell. It is hard to be brave at night shelling at night. Saps the courage from the bravest. Everyone lies there and shakes only the strongest can keep their right minds.

Speaker 4:          01:03:21       Okay?

Speaker 3:          01:03:22       It is on such nights as this that men go out of their heads. One will never know how he will behave in such an ordeal. Some men weep, other shake, some standup nonchalantly, apparently not caring whether they get killed or wounded. Some tell crude jokes, but mostly the men dig and dig. Set is only the direct hits that will get them Grimley and during the torture, that human being subject each other to not knowing who will go next.

Speaker 4:          01:03:56       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:03:57       We spent five days in that place, which was popularly called death valley. I don't know whether there was any real object and staying in dying there, but we were ordered into that valley and there we stayed.

Speaker 4:          01:04:11       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:04:12       There were always a few maniacs around men who had lost their mind through shell fire and had to be overpowered and bound.

Speaker 4:          01:04:19       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:04:20       Some men were buried alive and we were constantly busy digging out the live ones.

Speaker 4:          01:04:26       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:04:26       Many would be smothered before we could get them out. At times we would have a group of wounded and stretcher bearers making their way up the hill. A shell would fall among them in nearly all would be killed. So many men were wounded, wounded again, and we're still under fire. Sometimes we found two or three men dead together and so badly mixed up that we could not tell whether we got the right parts in the right grave or not. The men suffered and so did the horses.

Speaker 4:          01:05:05       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:05:06       One of my most painful memories at the front was seeing a shell dropped near to artillery horses. The horses broke away from the tree to which they were secured and galloped up through the field. One of the horses was hitting the abdomen. It's in test is it's an testings dropped out, dragged on the ground and soon it's feet were entangled and its own intestines to the point where it fell down and could not run any further.

Speaker 4:          01:05:33       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:05:33       Hey, lay there with its head up for what seemed like to be an endless period. It seemed to be more surprised concerning how it had become entangled in its own parts than in the pain.

Speaker 4:          01:05:46       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:05:46       we were sorry that was so situated by this time that it was difficult to put it out of its misery. I think most people when they think of horses, you just think of a beautiful creature running free and now you have this image for the rest of your life.

Speaker 4:          01:06:10       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:06:11       There was intense fighting at a place called surgey and the usual atrocity stories. We heard many of them. They went something like this. A two year old girl got in the way of a marching column of German troops, a soldier bay and edit it and carried it away on his bay. Annette

Speaker 3:          01:06:33       children were slaughtered for no apparent motive. The soldiers tied up civilian prisoners, prodded them with bayonets, put lit cigarettes in their noses and ears and shot them. Eyes were burned out with red hot pokers civilian snipers were tortured in every possible way. In Vimeo. They had been spread eagled in the public square or wrap would be placed under an iron kettle upon the man or woman's bare abdomen than a fire bill, a top the kettle, the victim was tortured first by the frantic running around of the rat on his or her bare abdomen when it became nearly smothered and terror stricken and pain filled from the smoke and heat. Then it would eat down through the body of the humans living flesh to escape. We found the dead body of a girl. Her arms were nailed to the door and extended fashion. Her left breast was half cut away. A young boy of five or six years of age lay on a doorstep with his two hands, nearly severed from his arms but still hanging to them at another place where the board of the dead bodies of a man and woman or girl and the boy, each of them had both hands cut off at the wrist and both feet above the ankle. Child of seven beheaded, a whole family killed including a young girl because the girl would not give herself to the Germans burn to death in their houses. All the women violated the entire German regimen, drunk, et cetera.

Speaker 3:          01:08:12       The above are exact quotations from the Bryce report which specialized in outrages against women and children. They are samples of the sort of stories we were always hearing. He goes on to say that he never saw personally these things, but this is the kind of things that they heard about happening all the time and they're getting ready for another counter attack. A court council of war brought the decision that we would cross the bridge in day light demand got ready to move and we prepared to rush across the bridge three or four at a time. The ranks of every company had been decimated and probably our outfit consisted of only four or 500 man instead of the full strength 1000 men. There should have been.

Speaker 3:          01:09:15       There were dead Germans all around, but I could see one particularly well. He'd been coming up the street, passed one of the garden walls and had been hit with a shell. His legs were laying on this side of the wall were lying there like they had been taking from some gigantic frog while on the other side of the wall, the whole the shell made, I could see the rest of his body. He was a powerful appearing man in his early twenties with a thick shock of blonde hair. His eyes were wide open. He never knew what hit him.

Speaker 3:          01:09:52       About the middle of the afternoon, the Germans tried another counter attack and we helped the defenders behind the barricade and in the houses farther up the street. By sniping from the second floor of the houses we occupied, we were prepared to stop the attack if it had penetrated down the street to our positions firing over the heads of men behind the barricade, we were able to assist in stopping this counter attack the Germans to had their snipers to cover the advance of their men. I remember one who's firing very carefully from a window in a house, well up the street. I took careful aim and he fell forward out of the window. During all this fighting, the air was filled with dust and with the fumes of powder. They burnt our noses, throat and lungs to such an extent that we could not tell if gas was in the air and it's this point, they're trying to make progress and they get caught in a horrible crossfire flanking fire.

Speaker 4:          01:10:59       Okay

Speaker 3:          01:11:00       frontal fire is bad enough, but flanking fire as suicidal men were getting hit all around us. They were calling for stretchers, trying to apply their own first aid kits on every side and some of them were gasping out their breaths to have come so far, at least 4,000 miles and to have their lives snuffed out so wantonly so uselessly behind this wall and the backyards of a remote French village that the world would never have heard of were it not for the action which took place there

Speaker 4:          01:11:35       and this

Speaker 3:          01:11:38       defense that they make of this village kind of comes down to one final situation that they're in. They're holed up in their about to be attacked by the Germans.

Speaker 4:          01:11:52       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:11:54       Some gas had fallen which added to the pain and bleeding of the wounded and prove to us that no hell in the hereafter could be greater than this manmade hell that we were enduring. Man. Men began to go out of their heads shell shocked if we could call it that or just crazy from weakness, strain suffering and hungry hunger with all bed. The death around them.

Speaker 4:          01:12:22       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:12:22       it was near the breaking point for all of us who survived. We would ask ourselves, how can there be any more? But there was more and worse. The night wore on and the morning of the fifth day was about to break the German artillery speeded up again. We knew that an attack was impending everywhere. I looked for dead men. There seemed to be no live men around to man. The guns here, they call them were shouted along the line and many of the nearly dead men rose up to man their guns behind the wall that had become almost a part of us. Wave after wave of Germans were coming through the pear, the pear orchard rifles, hand grenades and machine guns, but worst of all the flame throwers, I could see the men plainly, they had tanks on their backs and from the ends of their hoses came great masses of liquid fire shooting toward just at a distance of at least 50 yards. The smoke went far beyond us. We felt that the heat would burn us up. Every man able to fire concentrated upon the men who were operating the flame throwers. Almost immediately they were put out of action. Their tanks perforated and each man's body a massive flames. The flames leaped and shot into the air. Voss was the attacks stopped by the Germans own diabolical weapon.

Speaker 4:          01:13:59       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:13:59       They suffered far more than we,

Speaker 4:          01:14:02       okay?

Speaker 3:          01:14:03       Never after that in the war did we encounter that type of flame thrower again? They were real suicide

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       squad.

Speaker 3:          01:14:13       The man who operated those tanks were sure to Sophal a terrible and quick death.

Speaker 4:          01:14:20       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:14:21       It was a narrow escape.

Speaker 4:          01:14:23       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:14:24       There were just a handful of us left.

Speaker 4:          01:14:27       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:14:27       What do we were relieved that night?

Speaker 4:          01:14:29       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:14:30       Had staggered across the river. There were just 32 of us left.

Speaker 4:          01:14:35       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:14:36       Our companies on the line, we're almost completely wiped out, but we had held the line. They held the line adding on fathomable cost in blood and sanity and lives. They held the line in men like Bob Hoffman who met face to face with hell.

Speaker 4:          01:15:14       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:15:14       An evil and darkness that crushes you and laughter. And for many people it crushes hope.

Speaker 4:          01:15:29       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:15:30       But Bob Hoffman overcame all of that and he came back and really from my perspective through fitness, he led an incredible life and he ended up writing a book about it and it was called how to be strong, healthy and happy, and that's a tall order. That's a tall order who doesn't want to be strong, healthy and happy in the book eat. Some of it's dated, much of it isn't, but some of it's dated, but I, I don't want to go deep into the book, but I do want to hit some highlights from this book on how to be strong, healthy and happy.

Speaker 4:          01:16:22       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:16:22       Some things to think about. Bob Hoffman Kiro from World War One who'd been through hell. I'm just going to read some quotes from this. Physical training pays. I always say that any exercise is better than no exercise. Now he talks about sleep a little bit in those folks out there that harassed me on Twitter, doc parsley constantly harassing me on Twitter. Tell me to sleep more.

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       This is what does it, what Bob Hoffman had to say about sleep. There are different speeds of sleep, some sleep faster than others and can awake, refreshed with a moderate number of hours of sleep, which would leave others tired and worn fast sleeping. Is it a result of properly operating bodily functions of Pref, perfect functioning of all organs and it comes to from accustoming the body to an hour to less sleep.

Speaker 1:          01:17:43       Many great men of history are reported to have slept only a fraction of the time that the average person spends sleeping. If we said that Thomas Edison, the world famous inventor would sleep up four hours a night, but he had a cot in his laboratory on which you would lie and think, and his assistants have reported he took naps during the day. Many men who are reporting to sleep up four hours a night, we'll make up for it with naps during day light hours. So there you go. You're good to go. That's all you need to do. Is Sleep faster talking to you, echo, tune in and what do you get? Nine hours. 10 Hours? No regular eight I think. Nice, nice sleep faster. Now speaking of that, too much sleep is not a benefit. Rather it is depressing causes, sluggishness and a state of the Frg.

Speaker 1:          01:18:45       I liked that too much sleep. Take that, take that doc parsley out there, but in all you know doc, no doc parsley, he trades vaguely. Yeah, but he's, he's, he's a doctor but he's, he's done a lot of stuff with sleep and studying sleep and he's always giving me a hard time because sleep is good for you. I'm only kidding everybody. Sleep is definitely good for you. I should sleep more. I just have a hard time doing it. There's so much to be done in the world and you're sleeping fast and I am sleeping with it faster than everybody else if it didn't. Another quote, any young man who desires to obtain the most from life should spend a good portion of his time improving himself physically. Regardless of your age, you should make it a rule to learn something new each day and to do something each day to improve yourself physically. So he's talking about mental and physical strength. He talks about learning stuff, memory, memorizing stuff, doing math in your head, just getting smarter. I believe we talk about that sometimes. The best hobby of all this physical training. Concentrate on your activities instead of worrying about the future. Welcome the opportunity to face problems or deals or battles of your life. You can build yourself

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       so that you obtained pleasure from overcoming, from defeating problems, apparently insurmountable difficulties. You can overcome all your difficulties in. When you will find the next encounter easier, you will have greater confidence in your own ability,

Speaker 1:          01:20:28       God problems. Good. Let's face him and uh, actually I forgot to mention this, but this book, I remember the last war I got from somebody on Twitter and I'm sorry. Hey everybody on Twitter. Number one, I, I don't know if people want to be mentioned or not. And also when I transfer, what people tell me to the document that I keep, it doesn't pull their names, so they're just lost. But usually people hit me up afterwards and say, oh right, I gave you that book. So somebody recommended the book to me. I remember the last war and once I started doing some research about Bob Hoffman and I saw he had another book that was literally called how to be strong, healthy, and happy. I just ordered immediately so I could see what he had to say about it all and I think, yeah, some pretty good information.

Speaker 1:          01:21:25       Here's another quote. People who know nothing of the pleasures and advantages of having super strength and health often say what good are muscles. They say they have no use for them, that they are healthy, but they are only half alive in many cases for they will never have felt the indescribable sense of power and wellbeing. The census superiority or capability that strong persons feel, many use of eliminated an inferiority complex by the growing knowledge of the power they possessed by their physical ability or superior already over average persons. We might have to do an ego check here, Bob on that one, but actually he's going to ego check it right here himself. I do not mean by this that strong men should go round bowling others by demonstrating their strength as an actual fact, a stronger and more capable a man, the less likely he is to make a show of his strength by hurting or fighting others.

Speaker 4:          01:22:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:22:26       But strength of mind and body does beget get confidence, determination, perseverance and many other admirable qualities.

Speaker 4:          01:22:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:22:36       So I think he, he, he brought it back around again. It's for you and I were talking before the podcast started about how some people, if they're a little bit insecure but they want to be a tough guy. They did. They got to act like that. Yeah. And when you're within your looking at them kind of like this guy must not be that tough cause you've got to act this way. Yeah. So they actually are getting less respect than they think they are. Yup. But if they actually had confidence in their situation, if they knew that they could handle themselves,

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       they wouldn't be acting like that.

Speaker 4:          01:23:08       Yup.

Speaker 5:          01:23:12       Here's another little something to think about.

Speaker 5:          01:23:19       Don't worry about things that might happen. Work hard and do the best you can. And if something happens, it can't be helped. Don't give up, never cry over spilled milk. What is done is done. It can't be helped when it's too late. I survived some apparently overwhelming difficulties. Easily enough with this point of view. Sort of your basic cause I mean no use crying over spilled milk. Don't abuse down though. Cause you know how, um, you know, people will have the attitude but then sometimes they'll let it overflow in the, it'll get, it'll make itself, they'll allow it to be an excuse to go prepared. Yeah, no that's, that's not a good idea. Yeah. Yeah. But it can do it, you know, cause it's like a, um, there might be a small light gray area, you know, cause they're like, oh, I don't really care that much about the outcome and what's going to happen that's going to happen.

Speaker 5:          01:24:14       So it might, like I said, overflow into the part of their mind of preparation. Oh, don't want to let that happen. Yeah. So, you know, cause the opposite is like if you obsess over the outcome, you might obsess over the preparation maybe. You know what I mean? That's, that's those kind of go hand in hand a little bit. So if you go the opposite, you know you can get that be like, Eh, well, whatever's going to happen, it's going to happen. So whatever. That's not the excuse we're looking for. No, no, no, no, no. That's what I say. Be careful of that. You know. Here we go. A few more of these. If you want to live long and be healthy, strong and happy, acquire habits of activity right now. If you are tempted to sit in an easy chair, find something to keep you busy. A few minutes to a half an hour with the weights will be best. If you find yourself going to the garage for your car to get to the grocery store, walk instead. I like this one right here. If you don't feel like getting dressed to go out, do it anyways instead of wine down after a meal. Find something to do.

Speaker 4:          01:25:19       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:25:19       don't pass the buck as they say in the army. Do it yourself. If there's an involves muscular action, clean off the snow, cut the grass, spade the garden. That's a good one. That's just a general rule. If you don't feel like something cause you're being lazy to do it, don't be lazy. The thing that you could do tomorrow, do it today, do that thing today

Speaker 4:          01:25:46       [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          01:25:50       otherwise you get this. If you put off until another day, your good intentions to normalize your body, it won't help the road to despair and unhappiness is paved with good intentions lost along

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       the way. I think he'd just seen him get after it basically is what I'm getting is what I'm getting from Bob Hoffman.

Speaker 1:          01:26:15       This is just an old school, just some old schooled mileage right here. If our country was invaded and our young men were a lot of cream puffs, probably cowards through never having experienced hard work, athletic competition or a good punch in the nose, we would lose to the invaders, lose our freedoms and things worth more than life itself. So she's basically saying it'd be harder. Tough enough, be tougher. I support this idea a hundred percent do things that make you tougher and better. Yes, activity is life. Stagnation is deaf in life. There is movement. These are all well known truisms and exercise. Bringing healthful activity to every organ, gland and cell of the body keeps the entire body and mind radially alive and with a feeling of pep energy and wellbeing that makes one so buoyant and alive that they feel like jumping and running. Oh, he's fired up. Exercise builds coordination, balance, control of the muscles. It build speech, judgment of time and space and distance makes the entire body more responsive to the will and he teaches the body to do the right thing in times of danger, even before it is directed by the mind.

Speaker 1:          01:27:40       Exercise is the best. Insurance against disease or sickness. Exercise builds confidence for there is no road to supreme. Confidence has sure has the knowledge of one's physical and mental ability. It cultivates power of will, gives you complete mastery of your physical and mental self. Promotes personal efficiency and all desirable mental characteristics.

Speaker 4:          01:28:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:28:03       Exercise improves the efficiency of every part of the body.

Speaker 4:          01:28:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:28:08       It helps you sleep sounder and faster so that you have more time for work and pleasure.

Speaker 4:          01:28:15       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:28:15       makes it possible for you to earn more. Exercise, makes it possible to live more. Exercise will only take one 10th of the time. You now spend on foolish expenditures of time and energy. This is, this is funny because this is written in like 1930 something. Now you have time to sit around to read for entertainment too often true detective stories, other true stories which do you no good but merely tell you of the troubles of others. You spend a lot of time at the movies perhaps or listening to the radio in idle talk or gossip in watching athletic events, which put which others put forth effort and receive benefit,

Speaker 3:          01:29:03       you know, add the interweb into that equation and social media and you've got no time in the day. Yeah. It's essentially the Internet is basically all that. All that one on the computer. Yeah. All that without moving all that, just less homes, right? Yeah. So it's sure that you can find time for exercise, you to obtain much of what is it worth in life. You must find time. Your health demands it.

Speaker 4:          01:29:29       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:29:31       And I'm going to wrap it up right here with this, this one. But probably you have done as the majority do drifted along from day to day promising yourself that you would start exercising tomorrow or next week or next month when the weather becomes cooler. Tomorrow comes next week and next month, cool weather and even next year comes and goes and you do nothing about it. After years of thinking about exercise but not acting, you find the firm rounded, attractive muscles of your youth have changed until the weekend. Soft muscles of Middle Age, you take on a little excess flesh and make mental note some night when you gaze upon yourself in the mirror that you'll have to do something cut down on starches or suites, get more exercise. But you've developed an enormous appetite during these years and at best you refrained from eating sweets for a day or two. It seems that all the things you like are the best fat producers.

Speaker 3:          01:30:36       You can't give them up. You notice you don't have endurance anymore. You get tired after you walked a blocker to your wind isn't as good as it used to be. Remember last night, how you puffed when you ran for the street car. Remember how you met, how it made you blow to carry you that empty trunk up to the attic. Your Taylor pokes you good naturedly when he's fitting your suit and remarks that the fattest piling on and your waste is increasing by inches. These are all reasons why you should exercise. It's not too late now. It's never too late. As long as you are able to be around to exercise and improve yourself physically. Men of all ages receive quick results from proper physical training. It's never too late to make corrections in your mode of living. Some classic stuff there. There's a little caveat there with he says it's never too late. That's true. That's true with Samara too late, but the more time that you have spent getting into shape, you can fall out of shape and when you come back to it, it'll be way easier. And I mentioned this before, that's cool. You can, you can keep telling yourself that I am telling you if let's say, you're right, you're right. You want to have a good base. If you have a good base of being, it's going to

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       be easier for you than somebody, somebody that's never worked out before. Yes. That's a given. That being said, if you take a person that's never lifted before, never worked out before, when they start, man, they make all kinds of crazy gains. Right. But keep in mind, they're still starting at the bottom of the ladder. So yeah, the first, you know, 10 steps in the ladder come quickie quickly. But that comes for everybody. Give her to, you know, give or take. So sure. Okay. In the small little picture you can be like, hey, that guy, he started on the first 10 steps of the ladder way later in life. So look at his gains weight later in life. But meanwhile, you had those first steps done 35 years ago. You're on step 125 right now. You are correct. The bottom line is both groups will benefit.

Speaker 5:          01:32:47       Oh yeah. Big Time. But physical activity. So the, the point being, you know, how any mentions this host was like, oh, I'll just do it tomorrow or I'll just do it. Um, you know, the new year's resolution or whatever, the more time you spend not doing it, the harder it is to get there and stay there. Cause man, you know, I actually have a theory on this too. Like if you miss a workout, you can never make it up. It's gone. Like he gets it, he's like, it's gone. You can never make it because you work out the next day. But no, no. You missed the day that you, you, that was supposed to be a different workout. Right. You've got weaker, you can't get it back that sometimes you need a break. I think we've got some questions about that. Sometimes you definitely need a rest to your push your body so hard. You're doing so much activity activity, but you're not going to get that chance to work out again and you'll want, you're not going to chance it anytime you waste any time in your life, guess what? It's gone. Yeah. So don't waste it. Don't waste it. Don't waste it with sitting listened to radio shows or Internet shows or watching TV. That's a waste. Don't waste too with that unless the shows are helping you. Well, yeah, yes. If they're helping you, if they're beneficial, if it's Jocko podcast, man, tune in.

Speaker 5:          01:34:03       But if you're sitting around, Oh yeah, reality TV, just random social media stuff that's not helping you get any better. Of course you're, you're wasting it and you're not going to get it back. Sometimes if I miss something or if I am lazy about something that, that that pisses me off and at the time I'll say, oh well, you know, I'll, I'll rationalize some excuses around it and then later I'll say, what is your problem? Why did you do that? And then it's punishment time. Let's go get the squat rack. And you tell him to pay for that. I think, I'm going to put this real bluntly almost to the point of ignorance, but I think you value rest way less than a normal person. I think I, I'm not going to argue with you or it could be that you value the work part of it so much that your rest is quantity wise less, but quality wise might be more.

Speaker 5:          01:35:03       And also like for instance, I don't get the opportunity, I mean when I travel, like for Princeton, when I travel, I barely leave recently, I have not had time to do Jujitsu and I'm traveling, so when I'm back here I got to just get it in, you know? And if I miss it when I'm in San Diego, I'm not happy. I'm angry at myself and I won't even let it happen. I'm just not going to let it happen. Even yesterday I was all tired and beat up and I was like, okay, well go train all tired and beat up because you're going to miss some days this week. So you've got to just go get it on work on being weak and lame and getting your, getting your game on. And I went and rolled with a bunch of people and do what I normally do. And you know what, by the time you're in the middle of a rolling, it doesn't matter anymore.

Speaker 5:          01:35:47       You're just dealing with a situation. Yeah, man, if you can get to that point where you know how you did this kind of a weird one where it's really good, really, really good exercise, but it's really, really fun to do. Yeah. So it's like a win win you don't like. So weightlifting I think is like that, but it's not like that for everybody where it's like it's fun to actually do, even though sometimes you got to kind of build up the, you know, kind of the energy or whatever to, you know, motivation, whatever to do it. It's still pretty fun. But for most people I would, I would argue most people exercises like work, it's like a chore, the benefit. And I think the more you do it and the better you get at it. Yeah. Either more fun. It is, the more you enjoy it.

Speaker 5:          01:36:30       For me it's a mental break. You know, it's a mental break from everything else. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm going to go pick up this, this piece of metal off the ground. Lunchtime bunch of times. Yeah. And, and the point there is, if you can get to that state where actually doing the exercise separate from the results actually doing it is, is fun. You can, you can recognize the pleasure in it. Um, that's when you can be on a program. You know how, like I just got back from quiet little like a vacation, but I still, I still rolled, I still, uh, did, you know, lifted weights and exercise great. Train with went so, um, before, and I think most people, it's when it's vacation time, they're off the program. And I'm not even saying I'm in specifically on a program, but it's just too hard on the life program on the deal men.

Speaker 5:          01:37:24       So if you, if you're into it, you know, like, oh, I look forward to going and training at a new spot. This is a lot of fun to be had there. There's a lot of fun to be, I'm going to trade the, the normal spot. But if you're in that mindset where you liked the exercise that you're doing, but you'll do it, you go on vacation, you'll do it then. Yeah. Looking forward to it. Yeah. There's no doubt. So you don't fall off having fun when you train as is and enjoying it. I guess having fun cause it's not like when I'm in the middle of the set of clean and jerks, I'm having fun. But that's kind of what it mean though. Where, um, I remember when I used to play football we'd, we'd test in Olympic lifting. So like power clean was one and snatch was one.

Speaker 5:          01:38:07       And I remember training for those things. If you get kind of good at the technique, right? Comes Fun with your friends, they're yelling and stuff like that. So it's fun. I guess I was thinking more of like a met cons when you're all wanting a good example, be just being frank with you. I'm not always having fun during those. Sometimes I want to not do it. Yeah. And I still do it, but I don't want to, it's just not fun. I would say more times than not, especially any kind of met constitution that's going to be the case. So my overall point is if you can get to that point where at the very least you can appreciate this. That's happening right now. I like, I find you some pleasure in here. And furthermore, I will tell you this, if you get to know the feeling of how you feel when you complete a hard workout, you go, you know what?

Speaker 5:          01:38:59       It's going to be worth it. Because when I get done with this, I'm going to feel like x, right? I'm going to feel good. And so that for me, that's why I'm, I think that's kind of why I'm doing hard workouts because I'm doing hard workouts because I know that at the end of it I'm going to be like, yeah, I feel I'm going to feel good. Yeah, I'm going to feel fired up for the rest of the day. I'm going to feel like I did something. Well. I'm going to feel like a quality human being. Like I didn't waste a little section section of my life full feel good. Yeah. So when you know what that, it's the same thing with waking up in the morning when you sleep in that that feels good at the moment. But then when you wake up you're like, oh man, I just wasted part of my life.

Speaker 5:          01:39:42       Whereas when you get up, even though it's hard, when you know how good it feels to be done with your workout that early in the morning and be like, yeah, I'm ready. You bring it, bring on the tasks. And it's strange thing about workout is the workout pays you, pays you back for your work afterwards. It's basically a, you know, you work out in the workout isn't what makes your muscles big. It's the response to the workout. So when you work out, it's Kinda like you did your part and now your body is going to pay you back with your gains, you know? True. So you're like, Hey, I'm done with the workout. I can go do some other stuff. Meanwhile I got that check coming, that gains check. That's a good daily. So yeah, that's awesome. And now I think it's about time we go to the interwebs. Sure. But first you can actually support the podcast through the interwebs. Echo. We do it well. Let the troopers, no, one of the ways, um, which may sound repetitive but necessarily so in my opinion, it.com/jocko

Speaker 7:          01:40:55       cause some people they want to improve their improvement with supplements and we recommend all we, I recommend supplements that work. I'm assuming you do too. I actually do. Yeah, there you go. So you get them from Onnit. Yup. On att.com/jocko shroom tech. These are the ones I take or have taken. Shroom tech, Alpha Brain Krill

Speaker 7:          01:41:23       oil from me. Yeah. We're addicts. Their audit out of Krill oil right now as a tailwind. Yeah. There'll be plenty of Krill. Just keep, keep your finger on the pulse of the Krill oil situation and then the um, or your bar boom. That one's good. That's an it. Is that a supplement, do you think? Would you call this food that's tasty? Yeah. On it.com/jocko get 10% off all supplements. It's dope. Also if you like the shirts that we make, go to [inaudible] dot com and get one or more of that of those. Um, and then, uh, yeah, that's a good way to support I think.

Speaker 2:          01:42:03       And then

Speaker 7:          01:42:07       before you do your Amazon shop shopping, clickthrough Jocko, podcast.com, there's like, there's a little link on there. Um, and then Jocko stories while this Amazon Linkedin, click there first, then do the shopping. Um, also on the Jocko podcast website, we have all, I put all the books that you cover on all these podcasts so you can see what they're about. Click on it if you want to get one of those books and then,

Speaker 2:          01:42:35       okay.

Speaker 7:          01:42:35       audible.com audible is just the way to listen to audio books. So what they're doing is they're giving you 30 days free 30. Um, if you go to audible.com/jocko so you get 30 days free and then you get to download a free book.

Speaker 1:          01:42:52       But once you, did they download? Do you think, would you recommend, I think my recommendation would clearly be a little book by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin called extreme ownership. We actually read the audio book too. So if you like the Jocko podcast, you're probably going to like here in the extreme ownership read bios. It's about eight hours long. So it's like getting four podcasts, maybe even five podcasts. But yeah, you know, we've gotten some really because of the support people of showing the podcast and it's becoming more popular. We been getting hammered by a bunch of people that want to sponsor us and we don't want a bunch of sponsors. In fact, we don't want any. The only thing we want is if there's things that can help people, help people get better, well then that's what we want. So on, it gives you the supplements that you need, some of the gear that you need. And then on top of that you've got all the bowl, which is a way to listen to books while you can't have the ability to read. So if you're driving, if you're doing yard work, if you're doing some something that requires your hands and your eyes, you can just listen to a book on audible.com/jocko and so that's a another way to also then thereby support the podcast. 30 days free book. Do it get smarter.

Speaker 7:          01:44:13       I recommend the extreme ownership as well. It's interesting that you guys read it cause that's not always the case, right? Sometimes it's, it's like a professional reader or whatever. But um, like if you know what leafs voice sounds like, sounds like Batman. He does have bad anyway. There it is. Yes, indeed.

Speaker 1:          01:44:32       So yeah, there you go. Let's get to the question of questions. I'm down. All right. First Question Jocko,

Speaker 7:          01:44:42       do you ever feel burnt out from going full tilt several days or several weeks in a row? And if so, what do you do?

Speaker 1:          01:44:49       Never. No, of course. Um, you know, burning the candle at both ends. Eventually it's gonna catch up with you. And for me, it's can come in the form of too much travel, too much exercise. Sometimes I'll just be pressed at work, working with a bunch of different companies. Sometimes I'm writing and I'm trying to get a bunch of writing done. Sometimes I'm training so much Jujitsu it's going crazy. So anyways, or a lot of times it's the combination of all these things going on at once cause I'm trying to get a bunch done in a short amount of time and I end up whatever coming off the common off the track a little bit, coming off the rails a little bit and so what do I do on those kind of days when I'm starting to feel like that? Well, number one, I like to force myself to do it anyways.

Speaker 1:          01:45:39       That is a reality. So if even if I'm, if I don't feel like working out, I'll be like, you know what, just go do a quick workout and easy and easy or workout or I don't want to train Jujitsu. We were talking about this earlier. Don't really feel like training going to go train anyways. Then maybe there's some form of work that I'm supposed to do. I'm just going to go and do the work anyways. Now if if the next day I still feel like I need a break, that's sort of my red flag to say, all right, you know what? You need a break. Uh, you need to take some time, time, relax. Um, do some kind of active rest. I don't really like just kind of sitting around. I'll do something kind of active and probably eat some steaks, plural, trying to eat something really good, trying to eat some just, you know, I might, I might eat something really good like steaks and maybe sleep, take an extra nap, try and feel better, do some kind of stretching to try and feel better just to recover, just recover. So yes, I'm not super human like anybody else. Sometimes it get broken down, beaten up and I need some downtime and that's what I do. I try and rest, relax

Speaker 7:          01:47:00       and eat some good food. Yeah, that's a good one that I started to incorporate how you were seeing. Um, if I don't feel like it or if I feel like I'm starting to get burnt out, you'll, you'll, it's like that one last thing. Let me just do it anyway. Then I'll see if I do it. You know, because sometimes like how you say you avoid the situation where you just not in the mood. If you're in some days you just not in the mood, but it doesn't mean you're burnt out, you're just not in the mood for whatever reason. So that's a good way to kind of weed those days out. And um, and yeah, if you're still burnt out the next day or even the next day after that, then it's like, okay, you gotta arrest. Um, I started doing that and you'd be surprised what it, how many times you really not burnt out.

Speaker 7:          01:47:40       You're just not in the mood that's a B do, you might not agree with this, but if you are like, whether it be burnt out or just tired of, uh, you know, you're, you're just, you're just tired of the grind or whatever and you need a break or vacation or whatever. What I saw, what I sometimes do is don't do like filming for example, where there would be times where I would spend like months just filming every week fill. I didn't feel like no break and what I do is don't do any of it and don't think about it, don't just don't do it at all. And then slowly and I, in my experience, I was surprised how quick it came back where you, you kind of want to get back to it, but then I go like like a week or still not doing it. It's like Jujitsu.

Speaker 7:          01:48:33       If you're like, Oh man, I'm tired to training every day or whatever, you had to turn them in or whatever and you're like, man, I got to take a break after about probably like three days. If you're a competitor three days where you're like, man, I want to get back on the mats. So what you do is you push that even more. So it's like you're, you're pushing yourself to be burnt out on the recovery. So the only, the only medicine for that burnt out of recovery is to get back into it. But that hunger of getting back into it is even more than it normally would be.

Speaker 1:          01:49:01       Normal break. That makes sense. I guess. And I just want to call us in both out right now for being total cream puffs, I think is what Bob often said. Here we are talking about how we get burnt out on working out training, filming. It's like Bob, Bob Hoffman was, you know, living in the seeds of mustard gas floating around and maybe we should just say don't get burnout. Just work harder. Sorry. You maybe thought a real bad they're filming. No, I mean I was like, oh, I was typing on a computer on real burnt out. Shut up Jocko. I've got a better idea. Why don't you just be fired up that you have the opportunity to create something? How's that sound? Oh, you got the opportunity to go train Jujitsu to go get better physically. Oh, I think I'm going to go ahead and do that. I'm not going to sit there and say burnout out on training. No, no, no. Be burnout if Bob Hoffman is not burned out on the front lines of World War One. I don't think we have an excuse to be burnout on the pleasurable things we get to do in life, but suck it up and just drive on. I'm changing my answer.

Speaker 1:          01:50:14       There you go. Next question Jocko. Hi Guys. How about judo as a martial art compared to Jujitsu? Judo is a great martial art and Jujitsu is actually rooted in judo and I guess originally judo was rooted in Jujitsu and there are some connections or I mean my eda from Japan. He taught judo to Carlos Gracie in Brazil which was then learned by alien Gracie who then morphed it into what we consider now to be Brazilian or Gracie Jujitsu. But you can see clearly if you look at judo that Jujitsu exists inside. I mean Brazilian Jiu Jitsu exist inside of judo. There's no doubt about it, but there are some things about judo that have morphed it into a different direction. Number one, in judo, if you throw somebody and anything touches the ground before their feet, you went automatically. You can also pin people in judo. If you hold them down for, I think it's 20 seconds, then the match is over and you win both of those.

Speaker 1:          01:51:27       So what that does is now you can imagine if you get thrown, okay, you win. If you're on the ground with your back down for 20 seconds, you win. So what does that do? It eliminates a part of fighting that is very important. And in there are really two pieces of judo. One of them is called Randori, which is basically rolling and the other one is Newaza, which is ground work. And those two are directly correlated or part of Jujitsu. But jujitsu bottom line in both these, if you don't know anything about these two, Jujitsu allows the fight to go on even after you get thrown. And it allows the fight. You can't, there's no pinning in Jujitsu. You are allowed to fight and continue to fight until the match is over. And you can recover from being pinned just like you can recover from being frozen.

Speaker 1:          01:52:22       And it doesn't really matter. I mean, today we were training today and we got some good judo players. Keeling was, you know, judo keeling. Yeah. And he, he tossed, he tossed Andy Big Andy and I mean cause he's better at judo and he tossed him and it was legit. Then Andy ended up getting out of that position and getting in a better position. Right. And so the fight wasn't over just cause he got right. And so that's, that's one of the big benefits of Jujitsu is that you will generally learned better ground game and but judo you will definitely have better takedowns. I mean a judo player is going to have better take downs that a Jujitsu player and I'll tell you if we're just going to start ranking things, you've got to throw wrestling out there because wrestling has possibly better take downs. The judo, I mean with the geese. Sure. Judo has a, it has an advantage. But if you don't know this, in 2010 they actually banned the double leg take down from judo competitions in the whole world. Right? Why? Because wrestlers came in and started double leg in people. Boom, boom. Just hitting double legs. So yes, I would say judo is an awesome martial art. It really in some ways could be considered the precursor to Brazilian Jujitsu, even though judo itself is, comes from actual Japanese Jujitsu.

Speaker 1:          01:53:47       But I would say if you're going to, if you've got the opportunity to learn in judo, yeah, learn it, learn especially, you know, you'll learn the takedowns and those are great things to have in real life. They're great things to have in, in self defense situations. To be able to take someone down with judo throws is awesome. In jujitsu competitions, if you're a judo player in Jujitsu competitions, you're going to, you're going to get the take down with when it's a key competence, unless you're going against a really good wrestler. So good thing to augment Jujitsu with. But I would say you would want to make Jujitsu your main focus.

Speaker 7:          01:54:17       I agree that, yeah. So a lot of times when you learn, did you to some, a lot of, especially nowadays, a lot of guys avoid that. The takedown LMS. So they know ground game is just vast, but the takedown elements. So you'll get a lot of people pulling garden, which just means pulling a guy down on top of you. That's what filling, which is a crazy thing to do in a real fight. Yeah. But, but man, if you're good for sure you can totally do that. That's what's crazy about it. No,

Speaker 1:          01:54:46       even if you're really good at it, you don't want to be pulling people on top of you.

Speaker 7:          01:54:50       I did compare it to it and being able to take them down compared to being on the side of no brainer. Yeah. Not even close. So what I like about, I mean wrestling I think is more, I mean arguably more, more dynamic of, of a thing because it's all these different situations even on top of just the takedown part. But man, judo, I feel like it takes a little less energy and it can kind of keep you in. Positionally can keep you in safe areas when you're standing up. Cause you know, like these weird positions where you're on balance in that guys off balance or you, you're controlling the guys wait when you're standing up. And um, so I learned like a signal. I took judo when I was young for just for a little bit and then I never would have guessed that for a little bit anyway.

Speaker 7:          01:55:37       And then, but as an adult I learned a little bit of judo, um, from, from Terry. So could you see of the judo background? Um, and man, he was showing me stuff. He was like, Hey, wrestlers will do this. And he'd kind of show or they grab your head, neck and, and he's like, and here's what you do as a judo guy guy. And he, it's an elaborate thing he taught me, but it's like, Dang, these are real useful things for Jujitsu. Even aside from the take down part of it and then going to the take down part of it. If you know the takedowns solid, even if you don't like three or four really good ones and you're really good at them, that'll change your whole approach and your whole outlook on Jujitsu. So, okay, here's an example. Let's say you go into, I dunno, you know party here everyday thing where you could find yourself in a situation where you got to, you got to get in a fight or defend yourself or your friend or whatever.

Speaker 7:          01:56:28       If you know take downs, especially take downs where you don't have to like risk like doing the double leg in a real situation. That's kind of an all or nothing situation. You know, you can't just, it's not like this gradual escalating of force with a double leg take down. With judo it's different, much more subtle with your takedowns with varying levels of force, you know with the, with the judo situation. So if, and if you're good at that, men, when you get into these situations, it's like no factor. You not worried about it at all compared to like you don't know, take putting your Jujitsu is sick. You're like, Nah, I got to get this thing to the ground and it's like that's going to be a pain in the ass once we get there, I'm fine. But just that one little crossover from standing or no fight to fight. It's like they kind of can provide some anxiety for you. But if you know that doodle, whatever. Yep.

Speaker 1:          01:57:19       The, I guess the overall point is learned that judo very useful not right. And that's not to mention when the other guy knows it, you know what to do to. Yeah, because otherwise I'm just getting tossed keeling, toss me the other guy.

Speaker 7:          01:57:32       Oh yeah. And sometimes it can be funny and fun cause you know they can toss to you and you landed on your back and stuff like that with Manson, you land on your head.

Speaker 1:          01:57:40       Yeah. That's crazy. There is some validity to the a pawn in that if you were in a street fight and you got thrown and land and the person puts you down in a bad way, I mean you're still, it's, it's like, it's not like you're going to get knocked out 100% of the time. Probably not even 50% of the time, but there is a, there is a chance that getting thrown it palm style in a street fight could be, I mean, you go go pull up some judo videos of people getting tossed it bone style. Even in the, in the high levels. Some of those guys, if they landed on the street, they would be injured not all the time. And you do learn to, you learn to fall in judo, you learn how to break your fall. But yeah, some of those would be devastating if they happen to you in the street. So that's why iPhone does have some validity to it, that if you tossed someone super hard and they landed on their back or on their head on the street on concrete, they would be severe. They would be that. It could be a fight ender, but, but it's not going to be a fighter. That's the problem. It's not going to be a fight ender. It's possible that it is a just like,

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       uh, a left hook is possibly a fight ender, but it's not guaranteed Dan to fight.

Speaker 7:          01:58:47       I'll tell you a guaranteed fight, ender rear naked choke. Willing to fight. Yeah. And if I'll tell you in knowing some judo and especially knowing some judo moves that I feel like I'm pretty solid at. If you do it against the guy who doesn't really know that much judo. Oh yeah. It's your choice whether you want to put them on his head or his back. It's your choice. So if, if that's the other guys' choice that you're fighting with or competing against or whatever, then that's his choice, not yours. So that's the reason to at least know.

Speaker 3:          01:59:15       Yeah, for sure. You should know for sure. I learned judo, learn wrestling, learn Jujitsu. Jujitsu is the most complicated. Learn it first. Spend the most time on it. Learning to strike to more Thai boxing, saying this for the millions of times. Although I actually do sometimes leave judo out, not intentionally, but just, I just do. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:59:43       I personally liked wrestling. I like it personally. I like it better than wrestling because when I was started to learn wrestling with them, Greg, Greg, train on you. Come and get you. Why tell him this too. But this, I'm not saying I dislike wrestling, I'm just saying I like judo better because like I said, when you shoot a double or a single or something and he stuffs it in a bet, a worse situation than if you go for, you know, some, you know saying doggy or something and you don't get, well he's on your back. But you know what I mean though, it failed. Judo throw, you have way less of a price to pay typically. Do you usually have less of a price to pay on a judo throw than you do in a wrestling, takedown understanding verse? It depends, but yes, generally speaking, in my experience, that's why

Speaker 3:          02:00:33       I'll, I'll give that to you with like a, like a small percentage of agreement that not a full, yeah, I mean it's not that black and white for sure. That's Greco guys, Greco, Roman Russell. Now they're not shooting on you anymore and believe me, you're getting tossed. You know, you train with a good Greco guy. They're not grabbing your legs at all. They're not even shooting, but they are throwing you right. And they don't have to grab the Gita do it. So Greco Greco Greco was awesome.

Speaker 7:          02:01:00       Yeah, I agree. Um, and then also the judo thing, it tends to, in my experience, um, take less out of you.

Speaker 3:          02:01:11       You know, it's, it's a less, it's somewhere in between Jujitsu and wrestling is the exertion. Yeah. Jeffery phone, black and white. A lot of generalities. Please don't go crazy because of some generalities that echo made quick. Wait, are we good there? Do you have any more to add? I have nothing further to add. Alright. Keep training everything you can. Yeah, I liked the judo. Thumbs

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       up for the Judah though, for sure. Question number three. What's your recommendation for an employee that is late to work? Who usually is late but they're usually a good performer.

Speaker 1:          02:01:56       So being late is unacceptable. And I, I tell us when I've right pork with a company and they start talking about, well, you know, this guy is late for a meeting sometimes. I always tell him that I was in the military for 20 years and I was literally never late. I was literally never late one time. Yeah. We'll think about that 20 years. Never late, never late, never late. Any time for anything we would, you know, we would show up at work in the morning so early that even if the worst case scenario, my, I got t boned on the way to work, I would still be able to get insurance, get everything covered, get a cab and still show up and be an hour early.

Speaker 1:          02:02:40       So you should be, you're right in the fact that being on time is definitely very, very important. So people shouldn't be late. So now with this individual got someone that's showing up late for work, you got it. Like any other leadership challenge, what I would attack is making sure they understand why. Why is it important? Some people never make the connection as to why being on time is important. So you got to explain to them why it's important. You got to explain to them that's basic respect for other people's time. That it's basic operational readiness is to follow a timeline that it's about being prepared, that it's about showing your reliability and your professionalism to two other people that you're working with inside and outside of your company.

Speaker 2:          02:03:35       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:03:36       And even Sun Su sewn too. And I, I didn't say this during the, during the podcast that we did about Sun Su, and I can't believe I didn't say it because I always believe in luck. Waking up early and being early and Sun Tzu said that he who is waiting on the battlefield is gonna win and who he was rushing late to the battlefield is gonna lose. Well, that's the way your life is too. And if you're rushing and you things are disorganized and you're running late, it's horrible. But if you wake up early and you show up early and you're ready and you're prepared and you're waiting on the battlefield, you're going to win. That's all there is to it. So those are the important things that you have to explain to your employee that they, so that they understand why being late is an unacceptable and why being on time is the standard that needs to be maintained. Some people, it's a horrible habit that some people have of being, wait,

Speaker 7:          02:04:38       it's a horrible habit. Yeah. You don't want to get into it. It just, just unreliability. Yeah. Um, I, it was one of those people, I used to work in the nightclub in here, San Diego downtown for awhile too, from like seven years. And unlike you, I feel like, I feel like, I don't know, I don't, I didn't engage it or another count them, but it feels like I was late at the very least one minute late, you know, you have a shift, right. And it starts at whatever time, either one minute late or 10 minutes late, I feel like I was more late, more times than I was on time. I feel like. Right. So my dad was always late. I come from a long line of late guys, so to speak, but nonetheless. Um, but I was this guy, I was the guy who was a good performer.

Speaker 7:          02:05:27       Right? I felt like, I mean, according to my bosses and stuff, and I would, you know, I do well, other than the time thing, I was pretty reliable, very reliable in the nightclub industry. So, and I'd always justify it like, man, all this time I would take to be prepared to get there and find parking and all this stuff. I could be doing something else in my life or whatever. Not necessarily useful stuff, but just something else. Why do I have to work while I'm not working? You know, like preparing for work. I know that was kind of my attitude. As long as I have good output, as long as my job is being done, it's fine. So when I stopped the, you know, when I was done with the nightclub industry, jade, my brother would, um, he explained it to me where in the, the, the thing that I read that really kind of hit me was being late is a blatant disregard and a blatant display of disrespect to the person or people who were waiting for you, no doubt about it.

Speaker 7:          02:06:27       Their time, which is time is like when you really think about, it's the most valuable thing you have. So even if you're talking about one minute or he's talking about one hour, you are wasting that person's time. If you have a meeting or something, right? You show up five minutes late, people were waiting for you to start the meeting. That's five minutes gone where, you know, we still have to go over that material, so we're going to spend an extra five minutes just because you're relate, because you failed to prepare. Everyone else was there on time and you're the one doing it, you know. So, and then also I learned through a, I want to say it was a book I read, I forget where, but um, where one of the two major, the main things that ensure your success or we'll get in the way of your success is reliability, being reliable.

Speaker 7:          02:07:11       So, and, and w one day I went to the store, right? And my wife sends me in the shopping sprees. She says, get this kind of tomatoes, canned tomatoes. But it was like at this specific kind of, you ever tried to go chat for canned tomatoes, Broccoli? There's like this one and this one, this one. And I'm like, I'm just going to either just grab one, anyone cause I can't find this one or I'm not going to get him at all. I'm just going to go home and be like, you get to tomatoes if you want. I don't even want whatever it is you're making with shit. So I have a bat, I'm getting frustrated on the insight like, oh, like low down the line of frustrating things that I've told myself all the way to the point of this isn't my job to do this. It is my job by the way, but this isn't my job. I don't want to meet. It was why should I even, why am I even shopping right now?

Speaker 7:          02:07:59       I'm making a point and in my opinion is a very important point. So if I do that, if I'm like, you know what? Screw it, I'm not getting the tomatoes or I'm just going to go ahead and settle for the wrong one. I've demonstrated and basically proclaim that I am unreliable. So why would anyone come to me for anything who's disabled? I'm going to be reliable about it. And sure, you might be reliable on some things, but you've demonstrated that you can and will be unreliable under certain circumstances and those circumstances are dictated by by you. So who knows? Really. You're not gonna get hired. No, you're not. You might not even be somebody's friend when you think about it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:08:41       Or husbands or whatever, you know, it shows lack of being on time shows a total disrespect for other people's time and it shows a lack of reliability on your part. So these are the kinds of things you got to explain to your subordinates or explain to this person that's being constantly late so that they understand why you're telling them that and then you they can then they can improve and then you can, you know, if the person's a good performer, generally that means that her type of person, I care about how they're perceived and doing a good job. So let's get them to understand how being late effects everybody else and affects their own reputation as, as a performer.

Speaker 7:          02:09:21       Yeah. So it'll mean something to them. Plus you'll be at come through guy. Everyone likes to come through. Guy Guy who comes through. I'm sure they liked you for coming in on time. Every single day for 20 years they did mix question. Okay. You stated in prior podcasts that you are grateful for an understanding wife who allowed you to treat your seal career as a number one priority. Do you believe that marriage and children should bring about a reprioritization of your life? Given that marriage and Al brings another person on your life, a partner, but also someone who relies on you and especially children who heavily rely on you. How did you reconcile, still treating the seals as a number one priority, both the wife and children you brought, willing to willingly into your life? Was there a point that despite having an understanding of life that you should have made the decision to end the seal career early because of people you have a newfound responsibility for debatably a responsibility greater than the responsibility for your career.

Speaker 1:          02:10:30       So this one, this is something that can be for people to understand, but yes, the seal teams was my number one priority over my family, over my wife, over my kids, over my own life, over everything. And just Fyi, I literally told my wife that before we got married multiple times on the way to the chapel or to the San Diego courthouse to get married on the way there on the bridge, driving from corn auto to San Diego. I said, hey listen, I just want to give you one last chance. Being a seal is not just what I do. It's who I am and you are not going to change me so don't think that I'm going to change. And she was like, oh, I know, I know what you are. You still want to do this? Yes, let's go do it. And what was good was to her credit, she didn't try and challenge that.

Speaker 1:          02:11:32       She didn't try and fight that. She gave that to me. She understood it and it's probably one of the reasons why we stayed married for so long and a lot, I mean to seal teams, if you don't know, this has about a 90% divorce rate. It's an astronomical divorce rate. And the reason a lot of it is because the guys are so dedicated to the seal teams that everything else starts taking a a second, a backseat. Now I think that my wife actually saw that I was loyal and I was dedicated to the seal teams and therefore she saw that as something that was positive and something that would transfer over to other parts of my life, including my family. Now to answer more on this guy's question, I want to think about this being a seal. The best thing I could do for my family was be dedicated to my job. It was the best thing I could do for the others tools I worked with. It was the best thing I could do for myself and for my family was to be the best seal possible. Why? Because we're going into combat.

Speaker 4:          02:12:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:12:43       And if I want to come home alive to my family and I want my brothers to come home alive to their families, the best thing we could possibly do for our families is to be totally dedicated to the job so that we're ready, we're prepared, and we can bring each other back. So I, that's the way it is. And I would stand by that to this day. And it actually does transfer in many cases to normal civilian careers because being

Speaker 1:          02:13:19       hardworking and being dedicated, your job generally is going to translate to being more successful in your job and if you're more successful in your job, you have more financial stability, right? If you have more financial, I mean, how many fights in families take place because of finances? I mean, I think that's probably the leading cause of problems and families is there is a, there's financial strain and so I think that it does translate somewhat to people in their normal careers, even if they're not seals, if they're not preparing for war, that they're trying to do a good job, they're being dedicated to their jobs so that they can perform better and have more stability in their lives. And by the way, when you work harder, you get rewarded more. It also eventually translates into more freedom because you move into a leadership position. Maybe you go into a situation where you're no longer working for somebody directly and there are over you and they're demanding. Now all of a sudden you get a little more freedom. You can, you can dictate what happens in your life more. So that's important as well. And also into on top of all that, guess what? The way you act and the way you carry yourself, you are actually teaching your family and your children something.

Speaker 2:          02:14:33       Okay?

Speaker 1:          02:14:34       Now, if you're a warrior, if you're a military guy, if you're then you or your children, guess what? Warriors have been going away to war for thousands and thousands and thousands of years and people have been just fine from that. The men have been raised by their moms because their dad was gone away to war. That's the way it is. So I think that that's okay. It doesn't mean that the warrior doesn't love his family. He does, but he's got a job to do and he's going to go do it. And also if again, if you apply that to a normal civilian situation, if your children see that you are dedicated, that you are hardworking, that you are a loyal, that's a positive example that you're setting for your kids. Now, of course,

Speaker 2:          02:15:35       okay.

Speaker 1:          02:15:35       The the shouldn't be thinking and I never came home to my kids and said, hey look, you're number two on the list of priorities around here right now. I might've said, listen, I've got a job to do. I've got guys that are depending on me, we're going to combat bad things can happen. I need to be ready and I need to be ready for my guys and I need to be ready for you. And so I don't think you need to throw it in people's face and say, no, you're the number two priority, but your family should understand that you're working hard for them. You're building their future, you're building it, you're, you're building a legacy for your family. That's what you're doing when you're working hard at any job. So I think that's a good, I think that's a good example to set.

Speaker 2:          02:16:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:16:27       And I think that there's nothing wrong with that example now where people can go too far, which of course they can, they can do it in the military, they can do it in their civilian career where the job becomes not just the short term, um, priority. Because I will say this, my longterm priority was my family, right? That was the long term priority. I mean I had these, the, you know, my wife and kids I'm going to raise them are going to put that they're going to be with me forever. That's the, that's what I'm doing with my life. So the long term priority is definitely the family, but the short term priority, and by short term, when I'm talking to years, right? Two years, five years, three years, that's a long, that's a short term priority compared to your family, which is going to be with you until you die. And so I think you need to keep that in mind and make sure that you're not sacrificing things long term. You know the words, if you're going to destroy your marriage because you're working so hard, you got problems. If you're going to destroy your marriage because you're dedicated to much to your job, that's not, that's not supporting the longterm strategy of taking care of your family.

Speaker 1:          02:17:47       So that's sort of where I come out on that. And again, tons of credit to my, to my wife and my kids who were, you know, I was gone all the time and they dealt with it. And guess what, I'm gone a lot too now I'm traveling all the time. And again, they all know that, hey, I'd love to be staying home with them, but I've got to take care of the family. I've got to support the family, I've got to maintain my situation so that I can take care of them if something bad were to happen. Yeah. And I think they understand that.

Speaker 7:          02:18:22       Yeah. And that's, I think that's a big component where you know, your wife and your kids, they do understand. And I'm assuming, I mean, given what I know about you guys is that, that you're, you're pretty clear through what you say and what you do. That you are supporting them and they are a part of your life. You don't cause some people, let's say, I don't know, this is a hypothetical situation, but let's say a cop, right? Or detective, he's really into his job. He's frustrated with the job and this goes for any job. The comes home, he's frustrated because whatever work stuff he comes home, but he's not dedicated to his relationship or his family that much. So he allows the frustrations of work to carry over, carry over. He takes it out on his wife because she said, you know, do the dishes, you forgot whatever. She then he's even more mad because he's frustrated with work. Like that kind of thing where, you know, he kind of in the back of his mind, he regards his family as something that should, I dunno, serve him while he does his, you know, real lot in life, which is be an amazing detective, you know. So I think a lot of times there's that. And then on top of it, the family wife or

Speaker 5:          02:19:28       the wife, um, has these expectations that are not clear, not, not correct, but it that way you know, where you know you should be home at a certain time. You know, you shouldn't be working late. You know, where your family, that's the worst. It's like I'm not coming home like, oh, I'm done with work and the seal teams, I'm done with work, but I'm going to the bar with the guys and I'll be home at midnight or one o'clock in the morning or two o'clock in the morning. And guess what, my wife actually understood that. She actually understood that, hey, these guys are a team, these guys are a family of their own right. And I got to let him go and develop and hang out with his friends because he's got to know these guys better than anybody in the world. Yeah, see and that's, that's, that's a hard thing for a, for some people to handle.

Speaker 5:          02:20:18       And now when you've got to be careful with navy seals, to me, yeah, that's absolutely true and legitimate. But some guys might use that as like an excuse just to not have to come home and wash dishes, you know, of course then they're, then they're wrong. Right, right. So, you know, kind of be careful with Allen, like, um, you know, I dunno a sales guy, he closes the deal and guys want to celebrate, you know, meanwhile it's done. I know mother's Day or something, I don't know, something or something to eat or Thursday can eat it, you know? Um, and you know, I don't think it's unreasonable for wives to have certain expectations, especially if you don't address them. Like, you know, you don't communicate or whatever. Like you have expectations, you have to, you have an expectation for your husband to come home after work you do.

Speaker 5:          02:21:02       So if he just doesn't show up all of a sudden, yeah. You know, I mean you're, I'm assuming you're going to tell your wife, Hey, I'm not gonna. This is why. Just like, are you saying you're going to explain everything? But some, they're like, I'm the man, I don't have to come home right now if I don't want to. Which is kind of true. But you're in a relationship, you're in a team, especially good in. And really, I would say one thing that's awesome about my wife is I would say, Oh yeah, sorry, I didn't come home. I was going out with the boys and she was independent enough and secure enough and confident enough that she was like, oh, okay, whatever. Hey, I'm going to go on to do this. Most of the time, yeah, there was some times flowers were bought, things were, things were rebuilt.

Speaker 5:          02:21:48       Uh, because you know, it's, uh, it's life, right? Yeah. And no one's going to be like 100% focused on that. Um, you know, that situation or the, the, the, um, you know, you go, how you say you, you said, I'm a navy seal, don't, you know, don't change me or whatever. She, that's not going to be on the front of her mind hundred percent of the time she has. She's a person, you know, and she loves, they can change you. Yeah. And even if they know, ultimately they can't, they still for a day they might, you know, and it can go back, you know, back and forth. So yeah, it's not going to go perfect, but as long, just like how you were saying you that early

Speaker 7:          02:22:26       and she is a strong enough person to be like understand that and understand the value of that throughout the whole process, then you know, then you're going to have success with that kind of thing. But it depends on how good you communicate it and how willing the Ger, your wife or husband or whatever the situation is. Um, it depends on how good they can receive it and go through it because some people are needy, man. Yeah. And you know, though,

Speaker 1:          02:22:51       a lot of military, I've been talking to a lot of military people that listen to the podcast spouses and service members and so yeah, guess what? Give your service member some room to form those bonds to be dedicated to that job because they are truly doing it for you. They really are. They're doing it for you. And now service members, as echo just said, don't abuse the privilege. You don't abuse it. Do what you gotta do. Be the best you can be at your job, bond with your brothers in arms, would that you're going on the battlefield with whether you're a cop, whether you're a firefighter, build those bonds, but of course don't abuse it and make sure you take care of your family too.

Speaker 7:          02:23:42       Yeah, Jessica, can you lead those that don't want to be led? It's still how? Hmm.

Speaker 1:          02:23:52       The beauty of that question is in its simplicity, and the answer is yes and no. You can't lead them in the traditional sense. You have to be indirect. Again, there's our word. Do you have to be indirect? Meaning you can't say, hey, you need to do that, or hey, I order you to do that. You need to be indirect. And the best way to do that with people that do not want to be led is to let them lead.

Speaker 2:          02:24:29       Put the, put them

Speaker 1:          02:24:31       in a leadership role. Say, Hey, you know what? You're really good at this. I think you've got a good vision here. Can you, can you run this, can you lead this? And then once they're in a leadership role, then you can make suggestions and you can subtly steer them as they lead. But a important point is that you actually have to be ready to let them lead. You can't just be like, oh, I want you to run this. And then all of a sudden you go all level seven micromanagement on people. You have to let them lead. You have to let it go. Let them go. Now you do need to make sure that they're being safe, you know, or make sure that they're being profitable. Make sure that we're not doing anything illegal or agregious in what they're doing. But you have to let them lead. You have to let them make decisions.

Speaker 1:          02:25:25       And so that, that is my first suggestion is to put them in a leadership role. Now, if there's no way to put them in a leadership role, then let them lead their little part of the mission, whatever that is. Let them tell you how they are going to do things. And again, you can make little course corrections along the way, but you need to let them lead. Now, one of the hardest parts of both these situations is guess what? Your Ego, because guess what? You want to be the leader. You are offended by someone that doesn't want to be. Let me look. Well, why aren't they listening to me? I am awesome. I am the leader. I'm in charge. I outrank them. Why aren't they listening to me? All those are little insecurities that you have about your own leadership capabilities. Don't let it happen. I was never offended by subordinates that I had that wanted to lead more, that wanted my job. I wanted them to want to have my job. I wanted them to be able to take my job from me. That's what I wanted. If they're doing that good, I can look upwards and outwards and I can focus on other things. Good. Come and take my job, be good enough to take my job.

Speaker 2:          02:26:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:26:45       And if I ever said to myself, I can't believe this guy's trying to step up and take my job, I realized, Oh my God, I'm being insecure. I need to put my own ego in check because you know what? If they can step up and do my job good, I'll step up and do the next person's job. So when somebody below you doesn't want to be led, let them lead and be happy that they want to lead. Give them that leadership. That's what you do with people that don't want to be led. I just thought of a riddle. What kind of, actually I didn't think of it. I kind of got it from Twitter than made her, made it into a joke. Okay. What, what kind of stake does Jocko eat?

Speaker 1:          02:27:36       Ribeye. Flank steak. Oh, I like it. Can't take credit. I got there. I like it. Good job. Twitter. That's awesome. Good, cool. Good solid question though. Yeah, that's when you hear a lot. Yeah. And I say said that obviously Joe, but that's kind of like fleeting by way of flank for sure. For sure. It's like you don't lead them directly how you would like traditionally or whatever. You're kind of letting them lead, but allowing them to lead. It's the flanking them. I mean the people that are like this, these are people that are either have a big ego or maybe they, they know more than you. Maybe they are more, are more experienced and you maybe they really do know more than you. Right? And they're bummed or angry cause the, you've been promoted above them. Yup. So now what am I going to do?

Speaker 1:          02:28:21       I'm going to be a jerk. That's what I'm going to do. And so, you know, I'm not going to support your plan and I'm not going to do what you tell me to do and I'm gonna have my own way of doing things. That's what's going to happen. So don't let that happen. All you gotta do is say, Hey, listen man, I really respect what you've done. You've been doing, you've been doing this longer than I have. You know, what can you, can you run with this? Can you plan this? Can you execute this? That'd be awesome. And then they go, oh, okay, Yup. Now do they think, oh, that's right. He's an idiot. He doesn't know what he's doing. No, not wanting to do it right now, when you say, hey, you have more experience than me, I would really like you to lead this instead of me. How's that sound? You can only pull that off if you're secure in your own leadership. It's a way it works.

Speaker 2:          02:29:08       Interesting. Flank him. Point blank style. At least. Next question, Jocko.

Speaker 7:          02:29:21       Podcast listeners and Twitter followers. No, you're before five daily, meaning you're up before five a workout essentially every day and are devoted a devoted student of Jujitsu.

Speaker 2:          02:29:35       Okay.

Speaker 7:          02:29:35       What relationship do you see between physical fitness and empowering the mind slash wheel when a man commits really commits to changing as fitness? What else changes?

Speaker 1:          02:29:48       Well, you heard Bob Hoffman talk about this a bunch of tonight is book. Bob Hoffman wrote the book, the, I remember the last war and he wrote the book how to be strong, healthy and happy and there's no doubt that physical fitness is going to help you in every facet of life, especially in terms of what you're talking about. Empowering the mind and the will working out is a test of will, right? I mean it is going to see, can you push yourself harder? Can you get the last rep? Can you shave another second off the sprint, get you lift a little bit heavier. That's, that's what working on it is. It's a test of will and that test of will, and you've heard me say this before, starts before the workout starts, it starts when the alarm goes off. Can you get out of bed in the morning? These are all little tests of discipline and of will and as we've talked about before, discipline begets more disciplined. The stronger you get, the stronger you get

Speaker 1:          02:30:54       and physical will that it takes to get through these workouts that it takes to get out of bed in the morning. That carries over to mental will so you can eat better foods so you can get work done. So you can control your temper, you can create things and improve things and you can be better. Now, I remember a while ago speaking of Twitter, I posted a picture of early morning workout. I got done and then I posted a picture of a little d post surf session and then I posted a picture of posts, Jujitsu session and you know, so these were all like three posts in a row and someone made some kind of a comment that was kind of along the lines of,

Speaker 2:          02:31:43       okay,

Speaker 1:          02:31:43       oh, must be rough, right? Must be a rough life. You know, you're getting up, you're just surfing and doing Jujitsu. And an honesty, when I saw that with someone wrote that I kind of felt bad. I kind of felt

Speaker 2:          02:31:58       okay,

Speaker 1:          02:31:59       guilty in a way,

Speaker 1:          02:32:02       because here I am, I'm going surfing and working out, I'm training Jiu Jitsu, I'm kind of living the dream or in fact in my mind, I actually am living my dream, doing what I want to do when I want to do it. And then there's other people out there that are grinding, that are either overseas, that are in combat, that are working, that are doing jobs that they don't like. They're working with people that they can't stand in a cubicle somewhere, whatever is that doing in here. I was almost, I felt like, damn, I'm rubbing this in people's faces and I actually felt bad and I was like, yeah, bag. I can't be doing that again in someone else on Twitter.

Speaker 2:          02:32:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:32:46       Came on the same thread or whatever and said, discipline equals freedom. They quoted me and they were right. They made a great point. The reason I'm able to go surfing and do Jujitsu and work out and do whatever is because of discipline throughout my life.

Speaker 2:          02:33:13       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:33:13       And again, I'm not making no claims right now to be the ultimate success story. I'm certainly not, and I will tell you this, you know, I live in a great place right now. There was a time where my wife and I wanted to live down by the beach. We bought a house down by the beach, uh, dump that was barely livable and it was 850 square feet. And we had three kids in there and my wife and I, our bedroom, our bed, when you open the front door to the house and walked into the living room, our bed was on the floor right there for a few years. We were, we just lived there and now we live in a great house, but I have to remind people like, you know what, there was a time where I just was sucking it up and living on navy pay and we squeezed into this house and borrowed a bunch of bunny and lived on the floor in the living room.

Speaker 2:          02:34:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:34:08       But we had that discipline back then. And then the discipline of eventually

Speaker 2:          02:34:15       okay

Speaker 1:          02:34:15       becomes a form of. And so it wasn't always like this where I was just chilling in surfing and doing Jujitsu and playing guitar and whatever, you know, there was a lot of blood, sweat and tears along the way. And I, and, and by the way, the blood, sweat and tears along the way. I actually enjoyed. I enjoyed, I wouldn't trade it. I'm glad that I was putting those situations to do those things. And most importantly,

Speaker 2:          02:34:46       this

Speaker 1:          02:34:48       is available to anybody that, that life that you want is out there. And it might be a few years in the future, but it's there and you can get to it. And the path, the path getting there starts early in the morning and it ends late at night and it requires sacrifice and discipline and it requires force of will. And that comes at four 30 in the morning when the alarm goes off, that's when it comes. So get up and go get it. And

Speaker 2:          02:35:22       that's okay.

Speaker 1:          02:35:24       Why? And I think that the idea of physical fitness in powering the mind and the will, I think that's what happens when you commit to those things. I think the rest of your life will reflect positively on what you've done and go, guess what? I've been real lucky to, you know, I've been very lucky along the way and I won't, I won't say that, uh, you know, I made everything happen myself. I got lucky. I was blessed in a lot of situations that had good things happen. I mean, for instance, the housing market crashed and I was in the navy. It didn't matter to me. I mean I had a couple of houses and I was like, oh, I didn't even notice there was a housing market crash until I was buying more houses and they were cheaper. You know, it. But it wasn't, that was luck. Didn't plan that it was might've been a longterm strategy. Hey, I want to buy houses. But you know, a lot of people got caught upside down and some rough situations in the housing market. And I was lucky in the fact that I hadn't overextended myself again. Maybe that's partial luck, partial strategy, but that's a situation. Again, I'm just trying to point out that I know I've been lucky and in some of it, um, but let's make our luck with some hard work for sure.

Speaker 7:          02:36:38       Yeah, just you pointing that out that you got lucky, you know, and you recognize it. Some people, a lot of people they don't like, they don't want to recognize all the factors. You know, it's just easy to blame something else for what did it happen and then blame, not playing, but take credit yourself for something that does happen. Good. You know, so you're, you're over here recognizing everything kind of the good, which is party, your discipline way of being, um, back to your, your, your Twitter posts situation. That was, that was good. That was heavy. That was good. Right there. I thought. Um, and I know, thinking about someone who posted must be, must be rough, right? Like a sarcastic yes. Obviously that was just a fun peanut jerk. Yeah. Right, right. I don't think so. So let's get that out of the way. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:37:27       And, and if he, you actually in a, in a good way, some people might be like, Hey, I worked for this stuff. Don't say that, you know, take it the wrong way or whatever. But you didn't, you took it in the opposite way, which it says yet again more about you and your approach. So that being said, let me add this little part to it where, um, when you look at those Twitter posts, like that Twitter post, right, you have your, you know, the, the aftermath of your workout. You know, go look at, or Instagram, whatever. Look at every single day of your posts. Every single day you'll see four 34 wake up workout for three every single day. And then step one, step back and look at all of them all at once. That's just the clear picture of your discipline of you're doing it every single day. Cause like, okay, I understand I can wake up at four 34 tomorrow if I want to and I'll get a workout in and I'll be like, look at me, I'm Jocko and then go surfing.

Speaker 7:          02:38:24       Go do Jujitsu and eat plank stick. But if you expect me to do that every single day and I'm not used to it and, and I do it that same a lot more, and you do that. So there's your picture. That's what it is. Of course. Don't focus on just that little narrow view of, Ooh, how cool it was that he got to do, do you do to surf all day cruise, look at the big picture and that picture just like I used to. Disability equals freedom. There it is. There's your picture right there. Right there on Twitter.

Speaker 3:          02:38:57       Yeah, that was cool. That was cool. It's somebody actually had to point that out to me when I read it. I was like, damn they, they're making it very good point.

Speaker 7:          02:39:05       Yeah. Yeah, but man, that's like the perfect example in my opinion, that discipline equals freedom. It's like within that picture of freedom, all you see is discipline all over it. Starting with the four 34 in the morning.

Speaker 3:          02:39:19       And you know, I tell Ya, if I would have had more discipline throughout my life, I'd be in an even better situation than I am right now. Like I look back and Saint Man, what did I do this for? What I do that for? And that's one thing that as now when people talk to me and ask me questions, I'm trying to tell him what mistakes I made. Things that I did wrong, things that I did that were stupid so that they can say, oh, okay, because the opportunities are out there. You know, the opportunities are out there to make good things happen in your life, but you're going to have, they're not gonna, they're not gonna show up at your doorstep. They're not coming to your doorstep. I'm gonna go ahead and tell everybody that right now. You have to go out and make of them happen. You have to go out and take them because they're not going to come knocking on your door. The good deals not coming to your door, not happen.

Speaker 7:          02:40:06       It's so crazy how obvious that sounds. You know that other than like you saying that, I'm not going to be like, Hey, I never realized that. I thought they were going come to my doorstep. But it's almost like most people, I don't say most people, but it's almost like people don't really understand that that's true because you have like people who watch TV, like if you can't remember last, remember that. I never watched it. I watched a few episodes, but I remember people were just really into that and they're like talking about loss and the characters because that was a confusing shows. Why use that? Um, and they're talking about this like they know all the details and they're trying to figure this out and it over like seasons upon seasons of loss. And they know that like, Bro, you know what you could have been doing with all that mental energy and the time that it takes to watch all this. So you could have been doing a lot. And that last example is just one of many examples of what we all do. I think,

Speaker 1:          02:41:03       well it's very fitting place called lost cause you lost a bunch of time and a bunch of opportunity in your life. I mean there's things that can be so inspiring. I guess some artwork, there were some art form or some film or movie or show that can be so inspiring to you. But if it's not inspiring to you, it's not, it's not forcing you to get out and make something more of yourself or create something more than, it's probably not worth your while to be quite honest with you.

Speaker 7:          02:41:30       Right. And, and again, the, the whole, you know, last situation. I mean if that, hey, everyone's different. I know, but when you're watching TV, which is just, I think a huge one that, that people waste their time on. I mean, I can get some inspiration from TV with cinema stuff because I'm in video. But I think that I would argue that that's not why most people watch TV. That's not why they're watching. Uh, keeping up with the Kardashians. I'll tell you that. So I'm not familiar with this. It's a show on TV nonetheless. Um, people don't act like that. That's true. That Opportunity's not going to just come knocking on your door.

Speaker 1:          02:42:10       It goes back to what you're talking about earlier today. Are you going to let, are you going to, you only have so much time. You only have so much time in. If you miss a workout, if you miss a moment with your family, if you, whatever you're missing, is it worth it? You're letting it go away. You only got that day is only going to go buy one time. You only got one shot at today. What are you gonna do with it?

Speaker 7:          02:42:35       Yeah. Do something good. Yeah. It's just, yeah, it's just so interesting. Interesting how, again, this is like nothing new, you know, but I feel like we're, a lot of us act like that. That's simply not true. And that weird though.

Speaker 1:          02:42:54       It is because it's such a big, you know, you have a lot long time on this earth. If you, if you just sit back and go day to day, then wasting a few hours watching a TV program, maybe it doesn't seem like a big deal when you add all those hours up and you subtract them from the actual time that you've got here. Man, don't let it go to waste.

Speaker 5:          02:43:13       True. Don't do it. One of the guys on lost was named Mr Echo by the way. Thank you. Died though. I don't know. I wish you wouldn't have given me that information from my head. You've wasted space in my head. I like echo actual, we'll stick with that then. All right. Um, I think the last one. Yeah, I think we got time for one more. Jocko. I lost my little brother who died in a random medical accident. He was someone that I always looked after. How do you deal with grief and loss of men in your command?

Speaker 4:          02:43:49       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:43:53       Someone asked me a similar question that the other day. Some of them along the lines of how going to be good when you lose a loved one. And that's definitely a tough question. And I almost replied, no, it isn't good. There's nothing good.

Speaker 4:          02:44:19       Okay.

Speaker 5:          02:44:19       In death. And then I started to remember,

Speaker 4:          02:44:28       okay,

Speaker 5:          02:44:29       the people I've lost throughout my life, the memories of them, the experiences, the fun, their unique personalities

Speaker 4:          02:44:42       and it,

Speaker 5:          02:44:43       everything they'd given me not only in their life, but in their death, what their life taught me and what they're deaf taught me. The mark, the mark. They had left on me and I realized,

Speaker 4:          02:45:13       okay,

Speaker 5:          02:45:14       I realized that even in death,

Speaker 4:          02:45:21       yeah,

Speaker 5:          02:45:21       in death there is good. First of all, I was lucky to have that person in my life even if it was only for a short time, too short of a time, but at least I got that. Those unforgettable moments, those precious moments, at least I got those and I got to experience those times to know all the beauty of their personality, their attitude, their outlook on the world. They were all unique and I'm thankful for the opportunity that I had to interact with them, even if it was just for a short amount of time. Pin now comes.

Speaker 4:          02:46:25       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          02:46:25       death. Death is horrible and death is wretched and death is cool and Def isn't fair and I don't know why the best people seem to get taken from us first, but the fact is death is inescapable. Mm. There is no way out in the death in that death is part of life and like the contrast between the darkness and the light without death then there is no life. Then the people that I've lost, they taught me that. They taught me how precious life is, how blessed we are to have every day to learn and to grow and to laugh and to live, to live to a live every day with purpose and with passion to wake up in the morning and be thankful, thankful for that morning and thankful for the opportunity to go out into the world and live to live for them. For those that don't have the opportunity for those that were stolen away by deaths, cruel. Hamed.

Speaker 4:          02:48:35       Okay

Speaker 5:          02:48:36       for them I will live.

Speaker 4:          02:48:43       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          02:48:44       I will cherish their memory and I will leave. So let's cry no more. Let's mourn no more. Let's remember. But let's not dwell instead. Let's laugh and let's love and let's embrace and cherish everything that life is and every opportunity it gives us live. And I think that's all I've got for tonight. Remembering the ones we have lost by embracing the ones we still have.

Speaker 5:          02:49:53       So Devin out there. Thank you for embracing us and listening to what we have to say in supporting what we are doing.
