Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 16 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. We,

Speaker 2:          00:00:18       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:00:19       we couldn't have been more excited.

Speaker 1:          00:00:23       It was a real mission. None of us had been on a real mission before except for our l p o r, which is our leading petty officer who is in the fall, first Gulf War, and our platoon commander who was in on the Grenada invasion and fired at the radio tower. Those guys had this small amount of combat experience, but at the time, for us, that was a world apart from what we had because the rest of us had zero. This was the 90s there was no war going on. And so now here we were with a real mission on deck 1994 I think I was about 23 years old. I'm in my second seal platoon and at the time, being in a seal platoon was literally the sole purpose and focus of my life. It was my whole world and that's what most of my platoon mates were like as well. That's, that's, that's what we were. And this was an awesome platoon. A great to the Arg Alpha platoon.

Speaker 2:          00:01:40       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       and as far as having tight friends in a brotherhood inside of a platoon, this was definitely one of the best that I was ever in, if not the best in all of us, were just a hundred percent about being in a seal platoon and it was the world to us and we didn't care about, we care about anything else really. Not Politics, domestic politics or international politics. We weren't sitting around and reading newspapers and we barely even watch the news at this time. We were deployed on a ship. There was no internet. We were, we were troopers. You know, we were errand boys as Colonel Kurtz says in apocalypse now. We didn't know about the policy, but we sure as hell would enforce it. It's w we had this mission and we were fired up. We were, like I said, we were on a ship and we were off the coast of Africa when there was something going on in one of the countries there. And during the last deployment that seals did on a ship. At this time, it was some of our fellow seals guys that we knew had gone into.

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       And so that was a real mission and we kind of thought maybe this'll be our opportunity. And probably seven or eight months prior to this, the battle of Mogadishu had taken place, which is, you know, where the movie Black Hawk down came from. So this was, this was Africa, this was like our chance to get into some kind of combat.

Speaker 2:          00:03:19       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:03:20       And we started hearing more about the situation where they might send us, it looked like we're going to go in and provide some kind of security and it looked like we're going to go in and maybe help some Americans that were there and get them out. And then it looked like we might go in and reinforce some kind of UN troops and like a bunch of missions. And they kind of changed as the situation developed and in we started reading about what was happening and what we're going to be going to do and in what, what the situation was there on the ground. And I, I didn't understand it at first.

Speaker 2:          00:03:56       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:03:56       But there was people killing each other by the thousands. By the tens of thousands. By the hundreds of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people were being killed. But it wasn't like, oh, it wasn't like a war that you know, I had read about or I'd seen in the movies. They weren't shooting each other with guns or dropping bombs on each other. They were big week using machetes, let go like a horror movie. Hundreds, hundreds of thousands of people being butchered. And what was it all about? It was a tribal difference that's barely distinguishable to us. I mean, it's barely distinguishable for them. The country was Rwanda and the event came to be known as the Rwandan genocide, a mass murder, primarily of Tootie tribesmen by the rival who to clan now war

Speaker 2:          00:05:29       it

Speaker 3:          00:05:30       or something that I can rationalize, right? Maybe I shouldn't be able to do that, but I can. I mean, there's some kind of wrong or evil in the world that needs to be stood up against. You know, is it fascism? Is it tyranny? Is it terrorism? It's forces of darkness and they're pitted against forces of light forces of freedom and democracy.

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       And as I say all the time, war is hell and it should be a last resort when everything else has failed. And that being said, war is necessary sometimes to stop evil and sometimes it's the only way to stop evil. But this, this idea here, this situation where people are killing each other in a mob type scenario and they're literally doing it like a horror movie. I don't know how else to explain it. It's like a horror movie that seems to insane and to bloody, to even be believable. You take the worst horror movie you can imagine with the worst plotline, and this makes less sense. It wouldn't even be believable if it was a horror movie. It's too much. It's too violent and too ruthless. And there's too much to even comprehend or understand in this is, I mean, I hope that this is somewhere at the limit of the evil that human beings are capable of you. You hear me talk about the darkness, the evil in the world. Well, this is it. Yeah. I'm going to the book now. The book is called machete season.

Speaker 2:          00:08:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:10       The killers in Rwanda speak.

Speaker 2:          00:08:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:18       During that killing season, we rose earlier than usual to eat lots of meat. We went up to the soccer field at around nine or 10 we would go off on the attack. Rule number one was to kill. There was no rule number two, it was an organization without complications. The judge told everyone, everyone there that from then on we were to do nothing but killed Tutsis. Well, we understood that was a final plan. The killing of every Tutsi without exception. It was simply said and it was simple to understand.

Speaker 2:          00:09:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:10       There were some who asked if there were any priorities. The judge answered sternly. There is no need to ask how to begin. The only worthwhile plan is to start straight ahead into the bush and right now without hanging back behind. Any more questions. When you get right down to it, it is a gross exaggeration to say we organized ourselves. The killings began without much planning. The only regulation was to keep going till the end, maintain a satisfactory pace. Spare no one and loot what we found it was impossible to screw up. And that's one of the craziest things about this book. Again, the book is called machete season. It's the killers in Rwanda speak. So this author John Heads Fouled. He went into the prison where these people are now being kept to talk to them about what they did and it's their own words.

Speaker 2:          00:10:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:23       In the preface to the book, just to give you a little bit of background, ours is appallingly an age of genocide, but even so what happened in Rwanda in the spring of 1994 stands out in several ways in a tiny landlocked African country, smaller than the state of Maryland, some 800,000 people or hacked to death, one by one by their neighbors. The women, men and children core slaughtered. We're of the same race and shared the same language, customs and confession. They were Roman Catholic as those who eagerly slaughtered them.

Speaker 1:          00:11:09       And I'll tell you, I was seriously considering not doing this podcast. And in this book, Sam Harris, acquaintance of mine who does podcasts, who I was on his podcast, very smart guy, brilliant guy, and you know, he sent me an email and said, hey Jocko, check out this book. And you know, he said it's about the Rwandan genocide. And I immediately said, hey, you know, I was, I was there. I mean it wasn't on the ground, but we were there waiting to go in. So I immediately what he was talking about, and he's, you know, he's basically said it's by the killers. And so I immediately ordered it on Amazon and as soon as I got it and I just read it. And at first I was excited. You don't think all this is really, this is going to be impactful. But as I went deeper and deeper into it, I started saying to myself, maybe I don't do this podcast. Maybe I don't do it. Because like I said, it's, it's almost too much. I think it is too much.

Speaker 2:          00:12:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:31       And for that very reason, I'm going to do it because we, we can't, we, we must not deny that evil exists and that humans can be evil.

Speaker 2:          00:12:51       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:52       And as the pre of the book continues, our obligation, and it is an obligation, is to take what human beings are capable of doing to one another. Not spontaneously crimes of this order on never spontaneous, but when mobilized to think of other human beings, people who were their school friends, neighbors, coworkers and fellow parishioners as not human beings at all.

Speaker 2:          00:13:23       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:13:24       And when organized for and directed to the task of slaughter for the issue finally is not judgment. It is understanding to make the effort to understand what happened in Rwanda is a painful task that we have no right to shirk. It is part of being a moral adult. So now let's listen to these

Speaker 2:          00:13:57       people

Speaker 1:          00:13:59       then that might be a stretch, but let's listen to what these people had to say at the beginning. We were too fired up to think later on. We were too used to it in our condition. It meant nothing to us to think we were busy cutting our neighbor's down to the last one. It became a goes without saying. They had already stopped being good neighbors of longstanding. The ones who handed around the or Waga can at the cabaret or Raga was like a B, it's a banana beer. Since they wouldn't be there anymore, they'd become people to throw away, so to speak. They were no longer what they had been and neither were we

Speaker 2:          00:14:47       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:47       They did not bother us and the past did not bother us because nothing bothered us and so the Tutsis were driven immediately. They tried to escape to this area that they called the marshes, which are outside, you know, the hills, but people lived in the hills and they tried to escape the mart. Did the Tutsis tried to escape to the marshes and another one of the murderers says kindness too, was forbidden in the marshes. The marshes left no room for exceptions to forget doubt. We had meanness and ruthless and the ruthlessness in killing and a job to do and do well. That's all. Some changed color from the hunting. Their limbs were muddy. There clothes were splattered. Even their faces were not black in the same way they became grayish from everything that he had done. A little layer of stink covered us too, but we didn't care. We no longer saw a human being when we turned up a Tutsi in the swamps. I mean a person like us sharing similar thoughts and feelings. The hunt was savage. The hunters were savage. The prey was savage. Savitri took over the mind.

Speaker 2:          00:16:11       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16:13       The more we killed the more greediness urged us on greediness. If left on punished, it never lets you go. You could see it in our eyes bugged out by the killings. It would even danger some. There were those that came back in the bloodstain shirts brandishing their machetes, shrieking like madmen saying they wanted to grab everything. We had to calm them down with drinks and soothing words because they could turn ugly for those around them. Man can get used to killing if he kills on and on. He can even become a beast without noticing it. Some threatened one another when they had no more Tutsis under the machete in their faces. You could see the need to kill me. I was not scared of death in a way I forgot it was killing live people. I no longer thought about either life or death, but the blood struck terror and to me it stank and dripped at night. I tell myself after all, I am a man full of blood, all this spurting blood will bring me catastrophe. A curse death did not alarm me, but that overflow of blood that yes, a lot in one of the things that they talk about in the book, please in this, in this part of of continent,

Speaker 1:          00:17:53       the people, they use a machete for everything, so they, they do there, they cut down brush with it. They slaughter the animals with it. They, they cook their dinners with it. They do everything with a machete, so everybody's just sort of, it's, it's there, it's there, it's there. Iphone, right. It's their iPhone. They, everyone has, it's their smartphone. That's what they use for everything like we do in America. We use a smart phone. They use a machete for everything. That's how they get their food. That's how they clear out their house to how they build. I mean, it's everything they do. They do with the marriage too, so everyone's very comfortable with a machete, a boy with the strength in his arms to hold the machete firmly. If his brother or father brought him along in the group he imitated and grew used to killing youth, no longer hampered him. He became accustomed to blood killing became an ordinary activity. Since our elders and everyone did it, or a young boy might even prove more at ease with it than an experienced oldster because deaf touched him farther away. Given the novelty of the circumstances and his young age, death seemed less important to him.

Speaker 1:          00:19:11       He saw it as belonging to an older generation. He shrugged off its perils and considered it a distraction.

Speaker 1:          00:19:24       It became a madness that went on all by itself. You raced ahead or you got out of the way to escaping, run over, but you followed the crowd. The one who rushed off, machete and hand, he listened to nothing anymore. He forgot everything. First of all, his level of intelligence doing the same thing every day. Men, we didn't have to think about what we were doing. We went out and came back without having a single thought. We hunted because it was the order of the day until the day was over. Our arms ruled our heads. In any case, our heads no longer had their say. We became more and more cruel, more and more calm, more and more bloody. But we did not see that we were becoming more and more killers. The more we cut, the more cutting became child's play to us for a few. It turned into treat, if I may say so. That's one of the things they do is they use some, some words like cut and what they mean is slaughter and murder, but they use kind of a term that's less drag as a euphemism.

Speaker 2:          00:20:47       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:20:51       At the start of the killings, we worked fast and skimmed along because we were eager in the middle of the killings. We killed casually. We killed to keep the job going. Some we're tired of these blood assignments. Others amuse themselves by torturing Tutsis who had made them sweat day after day. Since I was killing often, I began to feel it did not mean anything to me. It gave me no pleasure. I knew I would not be punished. I was killing without consequences. I adapted without a problem. I left every morning free and easy in a hurry to get going. I saw that the work and the results were good for me. That's all during the killings. I no longer considered anything in particular in the Tutsi except that the person had to be done away with. I want to make it clear that from the first gentleman I'd killed to the last, I was not sorry about a single one.

Speaker 2:          00:22:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:17       Now, as I said, it was difficult for to to to tell who's who. Right? They had the same culture. They had the same language. They look the same and you might be wondering how did they know who was who? Well, the author explains that somewhat here and it is just, well, I'll go to the book after the genocide. Many foreigners, a wondered how the huge number of Hutu killers recognize their tootsie victims in the upheaval of the massacres since Rwandans have both ethnic groups speak the same language with no distinctive differences live in the same places and are not always physically recognizable by distinctive characteristics. The answer is simple. The killers did not have to pick out their victims. They knew them personally. Everyone knows everything in the village, so they didn't have to guess. They didn't have to identify him by a different skin color or by a different facial structure or by different language. They knew them. A teacher and a survivor of the marshes confirms.

Speaker 2:          00:23:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:57       The principal and the inspector of schools in my district participated in the killings with nails, studded clubs, teachers, priests, the Burgo Master, a sub profit, a doctor, they all killed with their own hands. They were pressed cotton trousers. They had no trouble sleeping. They traveled around and vehicles wrong light motorcycles. These well educated people were calm and they rolled up their sleeves to get a good grip on their machetes.

Speaker 1:          00:24:32       For someone who has spent his life teaching the humanities as I have. Such criminals are a fearful mystery. So like the, the priests, the, the, the burger master, which is like a kind of a German name of, uh, of someone that's a political person, political magistrate in a town or a sub prefect. That's a sub prefect. As someone that's in command, someone of authority, especially in the Catholic church. So these people with their nice shirts and nice pants were rolling up their sleeves to get a good grip on their machetes. At first, the killing was obligate Tori. Afterward we got used to it. We became naturally cruel. We no longer needed encouragements or fines to kill or even orders or advice. Discipline was relaxed because it wasn't necessary anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:25:38       I don't know anyone who was struck because he refused to kill. I know of one case of punishment by death, a special case, a woman. Some people caught her to punish her husband who had refused to kill, but she was in fact a Tutsi afterward. The husband took part without whining. In fact, he was one of the busiest in the marshes. So these tribal, the though the Hutus and the Tutsis would marry each other. I'm just like, you know, you put human beings living in the same village, you know, you end up marrying somebody from the other tribe and if you didn't go with the system, you are getting murdered. In the evening we had to report to the leader about exactly what we had killed. Many boasted for fear of being taunted or frowned on. That was also a good reason why we did not bury the bodies. Someone suspected of faking could guide the verifiers to the truth.

Speaker 2:          00:26:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:51       Anyone who had the idea of not killing for a day could get out of it, no problem. But anyone with the idea of not killing it all could not let on or he himself would be killed while there's watched voicing disagreement out loud was fatal on the spot.

Speaker 2:          00:27:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:11       So we don't know if people had that idea.

Speaker 2:          00:27:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:16       In the evening after the killings, there was time for friendship and meeting friends brought us light hearts. We would chat about our days. We share drinks, we ate. We no longer counted up what we had killed.

Speaker 2:          00:27:31       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:27:31       But what it was that it would bring us, the killings had made us gossipy and greedy. So that's one of the things that drove was they get to use you or kill a family. You take whatever you want from them, including their land, including all their property, everything.

Speaker 2:          00:27:47       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:27:49       So that's what they talk about. And they become, they become greedy.

Speaker 2:          00:27:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:56       And then at a certain point, the authorities no longer had the ability to plan or to channel. Their orders fell on deaf ears. The massacres had become extraordinary beyond all reason. The keenest ones, when they killed the grab the possessions of the dead, they wanted everything right away. Not even stopping to finish off their victims. The looting excited them so much. They needed no advice or encouragement. Their greed spread to those who followed, who went crazy and turn. We began the day by killing. We ended the day by looting. It was the rule to kill going out. And Luke coming back, we killed in teams, but we alluded every man for himself or in small groups of friends, those who killed a lot had less time to pillage. But since they were feared, they would catch up because of their power. So Hey, if I go out and kill the most people, I don't have that much time to loot. That's okay cause everyone's scared of me. Yeah. So they kind of let you, yeah. Some killers claimed girls in the marshes that satisfied them and made them neglect, looting. They figured they'd catch up the next day.

Speaker 1:          00:29:33       Now here's a, again, this is going back to the, the author does not direct quotes from, from the killers, but the authors kind of telling a story about a situation that happened. Um, one of the murderers witnessed the passage of armored cars. So the international community community likeyeah you heard me talking about the fact that I was on a ship with seals with marines that could have done something here, but we didn't do anything. I actually, the marines went in and provided a little tiny bit of aid. I think they sent 30 guys in, but it would nothing, nothing to what did did. He had, you know, a very minimalistic impact, but what happened was civilized people left and

Speaker 2:          00:30:25       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:30:26       so they see armored cars coming and they caused it here. Now this is going to one of the killers talking. They caused a big panic among, among us who are already roving in the streets, heating themselves up with sudden burst of gunfire. Some of them shouted, the whites are here, others will come. They have terrible weapons. It's all over for us. When they saw the convoy disappear in the dust without even a little stop for curiosity or a drink on the main street, they celebrated with some Primus, which is getting alcohol and shot off the cartridges and their guns is a sign of relief. You could see they felt saved. They will rid of the last stumbling block, so to speak. At the same time in Kigali, which is the capitol whites were leaving the embassies, offices, monasteries and universities via road convoys to neighboring countries and an emergency airlift operating out of the airport.

Speaker 2:          00:31:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:26       Very few foreigners sought. Refugee sought refuge in guarded villas, but no foreigners were left. And now this is again, this is the commentary from the author, not one foreigner, priest, service corps, volunteer, diplomat, NGO worker. None can provide a convincing reason for this immediate and astonishing flight during the opening hours of the killings. In any case, neither danger nor panic can justify such haste. The most telling explanation I've heard so far comes from Claudine. You stay a farmer and soup and survivor on the hill. When she says reversing our proverb, whites do not want to see what they cannot believe. And they could not believe a genocide because that is a killing that overwhelms everyone. Them as much as the others.

Speaker 2:          00:32:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:36       And so they left? No.

Speaker 1:          00:32:51       The thing that sparked this, there was a, there was a leader, so there've been, there'd been revolutionary or right as civil war going on and it was used, the Rwandan civil war had been going on and it was between the Hutu led government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front or the RPF. And so the, the RPF was largely composed of Tutsis and a lot of them had fled to Uganda, but now they were saying, hey, let's go back. And there was a bunch of pressure, international pressure on the, on the government, which was led by the president of Rwanda named Hobby Ari Mana. So Habyarimana felt all this pressure and so they made peace. And then what happened was on April 6th, 1994, an airplane that had, um, Habyarimana in, it was shot down and everyone was killed, including him. And that was it. So the Hutu president was killed, the, his aircraft was shot down and that was it. Um, and I pulled this little paragraph here from Wikipedia. Genocidal killings began the following day. Soldiers, police and militia quickly executed key Tutsi and moderate who two leaders. So they were just getting after it, then erected checkpoints and barricades and use Rwandans, national identity identity cards to systematically killed Tutsis. So in the 30s, they had implemented this system where you would put whatever tribe you were in because it was so hard to tell who was who. And they just use those identification cards.

Speaker 1:          00:34:38       These forces recruited or pressured who to civilians to arm themselves with machetes, clubs, blunt objects and other weapons to rape, maim and kill their tootsie neighbors and to destroy or steal their property.

Speaker 2:          00:34:54       But

Speaker 1:          00:34:54       one of the, one of the major influences on the people was radio. It was radio. And as leading up to this, you had this situation where they were broadcasting sort of I guess, I guess it's what we call hate speech, you know, that's what we call it only. This was actual hate speech going to the book in the broadcast studios of popular radio stations, Radio Rwanda, the Tutsis were referred to as cockroaches, announcers, the two best known whom were Simon Bikini and Contano used humorous sketches and songs to call openly for the destruction of the Tutsis.

Speaker 1:          00:35:50       One of the, one of the killers remembers those Gen and actually this, this guy was a, yeah, he was one of the killers. Those gentlemen were famous artists and great comic virtuosos. What they said was so cleverly put and repeated so office often that Tutsis themselves found them funny to listen to. They were clamoring for the massacre of all the cockroaches, buttoned, amusing ways. And for the Tutsis, those weedy words were hilarious. So they're actually hearing this and laughing about it. The songs urging all Hutus to get together to wipe out the Tutsis. We laughed out loud at the jokes.

Speaker 2:          00:36:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:30       And they made this who to 10 commandments, which is basically, it's a document. You look it up on Wikipedia. It's just a document that's the 10 commandments. If you marry a Tutsi woman, she should be killed. She's, I mean, it's brutal.

Speaker 2:          00:36:43       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:36:47       Absolutely brutal.

Speaker 2:          00:36:51       And now

Speaker 1:          00:36:53       this is, this is,

Speaker 2:          00:36:56       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:36:57       I found this piece fascinating. Continuing to talk about the,

Speaker 2:          00:37:02       the radio. And

Speaker 1:          00:37:08       this is, this is a statement, and this is interesting because we're on a podcast and I listened to podcasts and I've, I haven't talked about this before, but when I was a kid, I listened to radio shows and I understood the power of them. I listened to a radio show and I'll have to look and see where it is now. It was called the Dr Demento show. And the Dr Demento show was this, it was on like Sunday nights, 10 o'clock on some college radio station in New England, and it would just have various, it was like a variety show, right? And they'd have a comedic part and there'd be like a twilight zone type thing. But I would sit there like we do with podcasts now, and I'd put the head phones on and I'd get in the zone and I would listen. And you realize, and you realize this, when you get into a podcast, you realize there's a certain power to it. There is a certain power to listening to a person and their voice going into your head. And there's a, there's a, a piece about this inside the book and it just nailed me. It's, it's a remark made by surge Dany who was, uh, an SAS and he's talking about the first Gulf War. But what he says about radio, and he would be obviously saying this about podcasts now,

Speaker 1:          00:38:42       is that radio is far and away the most dangerous of the media.

Speaker 2:          00:38:48       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:38:49       It wields a unique and terrifying power. Once the state or an institutional apparatus collapses, it casts off everything that might attenuate or sidetrack the force of words. In a chaotic situation, radio can prove to be the most efficient tool of democracy as well as of revolution or fascism because it penetrates unhindered to the individual's deepest core anywhere and at any moment immediately without the necessary and critical distance inherent in the reading of a text or an image. So when you listened to a podcast, that's such a great note to explain why radio has so much power. You don't even have to interpret the words. You don't have to interpret an image. The words are going into your head.

Speaker 2:          00:39:55       Mm.

Speaker 1:          00:39:57       And they use it. They use it in situations like this. And one of the killers said ever since the plane crash, so ever since the president was shot down, the radio head hammered at us. The foreigners are departing, they had material, the proof of what we are going to do and they are leaving this time around. They are showing no interest in the fate of the Tutsis. We witnessed that flight of the armored cars along the road with our own eyes. Our ears no longer heard murmurs of repo of reproach. For the first time ever, we did not feel we were under the frowning supervision of the whites. Other encouragements followed that assured us of unchecked freedom to complete the task.

Speaker 1:          00:40:54       So we thought good. It's true. The blue helmets did nothing except an about face to leave us alone. And if you don't know what blue helmets are when you're working as a United Nations peace keeper, they give you a blue helmet and anybody can fill that role and he, any nation that's part of the UN Americans fill that role from time to time, but any nation can do it. So he's saying that the blue helmets did nothing except an about face to leave us alone. Why would they come back before it's all over at that signal. Off We went. We were certain of killing

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       everyone without drawing evil looks, without getting a scolding from a white or a priest. We joked about it instead of pressing our advantage. We felt too at ease with an unfamiliar job that had gotten off to a good start, but time in laziness played an ugly trick on us. Basically. We became too sure of ourselves. We slowed down and that overconfidence is what did a sin.

Speaker 1:          00:42:03       So let's hear a little bit about the, the psychological impact of what's happening to the book. Rowdy's kept on slaughtering cows after the killings because they couldn't put down their machetes during the killings. We had not one wedding, not one baptism, not once. Soccer match. Not One religious service like Easter. We did not find that kind of celebration. Interesting anymore. We did not care. Spit for Sunday silliness. We were dead tired from work. We were getting greedy. We celebrated whenever we felt like it. We drank as much as we wanted. Some turned into drunks. Anyone who felt sad about someone he had killed really had to hide his words and his regrets for fear of being seen as an accomplice and being treated roughly. Sometimes drinkers went mean when they had found no one to kill that day. Oh, there's went mean because they had killed too much. You had to show them a smiling face or watch out.

Speaker 2:          00:43:17       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:43:19       different personalities. Some guys are going crazy because they're not killing enough and some guys are going crazy because they're killing too much. A youth could hide a girl he had brought back from the marshes to have her behind a pen or a clump of bushes, but when he had had enough or when tongue started wagging. In other words, when people started talking about the fact that he had brought one of these girls back, he had to kill her to avoid a serious penalty. We had sessions with girls who were raped in the bush. Nobody dared protests that. Even those who are edgy about it because they had received blessings in church, for example, told themselves it would change nothing since the girl was marked for death anyways, there were two kinds of rapists. Some took the girls and use them until the end. Even on the flight to the Congo, they took advantage of the situation to sleep with the prettiest Tutsis and an exchange showed them a little bit of consideration. Others caught just to fool around with for having sex and drinking. They raped for a little while and then handed them over to be killed right afterward. There were no orders from the authorities. The two kinds, we're free to do as they pleased.

Speaker 1:          00:44:49       Now we get into a a story, I don't know what to call it other than a story, a travesty, a horror coming from one of the workers at a,

Speaker 2:          00:45:11       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:12       Add a little, basically a little Christian hospital. They surrounded the maternity hospital. They ripped down the gates. They simply shot up the locks. They wore very handsome cartridge belts of highly polished leather, but they wanted to avoid wasting bullets. They killed the women with machetes and clubs. Whenever one of the more agile girls managed to escape in the commotion and get out a window, she was caught in the gardens. When a mama had hidden her child been underneath her, they picked her up first, then cut the child than cut its mother last. They didn't bother to cut the nursing infants properly. They slammed them against the walls to save time or hurled them alive onto the heaps of corpses. That morning we were more than 300 women and children. That evening in the garden there only five women left speared because they were lucky to have been born. Who too. Now the author goes into a statement here about,

Speaker 2:          00:46:56       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:46:57       about a tradition in war torn areas where you know there's some sort of friendship or there's some, some love that that makes people do things that are outside the bounds of what the norm of what the massacres are helping the opposite side or whatever. So, so he says this, people have, who have lived through war often tell wonderful stories about friendships, incredible romances, amazing gestures of solidarity, comical and poignant collaborations between protagonists and enemy camps or humble and admirable deeds. It all provides material for novels, songs, films, and evening of evenings of memories, near Patches, things up between you and humanity. French and German. Conscripts conscripts chatted across the trencher trenches and swap tins of potted meat. Algerians hid French colonists with whom they played cards. A vici minister foiled the deportation of a colleague with whom he had went to school. It was the same in Vietnam, Ireland, Lebanon and Gola, El Salvador, Israel, Chechnya, in the name of passion, childhood, a clan, elemental things like affection or loyalty.

Speaker 2:          00:48:27       But here

Speaker 1:          00:48:30       we find not one comradery, impulse among teammates, not one gesture of compassion for helpless babies at the breast. No bond of friendship or love that survived from a church choir or an agricultural cooperative. No civil disobedience in a village, no rebellious adolescent in a gang of budding Tufts and not a single escape network, although it would have been easy to have set one up in the 40 kilometers of uninhabited forest between the marshes and the Burundi border. No convoy, no links among the herders paths, no web of hiding places to allow the evacuation of survivors

Speaker 2:          00:49:20       nothing

Speaker 1:          00:49:24       and it continues. He continues to talk about really the difference between genocide and war in war, men are killed first because they are the most apt to fight back. The next targets are women liable to help them and boys because they try to continue the conflict and then older men who can offer wise counsel. But in genocide the killers track down everyone in particular babies, girls and women because they represent the future. Genocide goes beyond war because the intention lasts forever. It is a final intention and again just talking about the fact that there was no mercy, no mercy. One of the killer says, I do not know of a single who, two woman who hid away a little tootsie child to save it from the massacre of its family, not even a toddler wrapped in a cloth or nursing unrecognizable to her neighbors because of it's tender age. Not One woman on the whole hill cheated in the way of a rescue, not even for a short moment of trying. And what are the other killers said? I did not hear many women protesting against two seat Tutsis being raped. The knew this work of killing fiercely heated up the men in the marshes. The agreed on this except of course if the men did their dirty sex work near the houses,

Speaker 1:          00:51:13       and again, here's one of the killers talking about the fact that they knew these people in war you kill someone who fights you or promises you harm and killings of this kind. You kill the Tutsi woman used to listen to the radio with or the kind lady who vote medicine plants on your wounds or your sister who is married to a Tutsi or even for some unlucky devils, your own Tutsi wife and your children by General demand. You slaughter the woman. Same as man. That is the difference which changes everything and here's the loan story of someone that tried to stop this. It was close to noon on April 11th sold. Remember this started on April six so it's been five days. The first day of the Tutsi on in this particular area is a door, was sitting on a chair in front of his house resting after a morning of weeding. He was a Hutu farmer, 65 years old who had arrived 20 years before.

Speaker 2:          00:52:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:44       Some strapping fellows armed with machetes came singing up the path that ran near his house is a door called to them and as deep old voice and lectured demond public in front of the neighbors. You young men are evil doers. Turn on your heels and go your blades. Point the way towards a dreadful misfortune for us all. Do not stir up disputes too dangerous for us farmers. Stop tormenting our neighbors and go back to your fields. Two killers approached him laughing and without a word cut him down with machetes. Among the band was is it doors son who according to witnesses, neither protested nor stop to bend over the body. These young men went on their way singing. Now speaking of family and I mentioned that some of the Hutus and Tutsis work intermarried and had mixed children and here's sort of the standard operating procedure for that. This is coming from one of the killers, a Tutsi wife. You could try to save her. You offered a cow to the leader and the radio with the like to the organizers. Then you handed out small payments of money to those who were prowling around your house, but that wasn't even worth trying if you did not want to cooperate.

Speaker 1:          00:54:25       Meaning if you didn't want to kill a Tutsi husband, you couldn't bargain for he was at the head of the list. If his wife began to argue, she was struck right away and they cut her husband while she watched to discourage her.

Speaker 2:          00:54:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:42       If she kept on, she'd be caught herself with her children. One or the other killers said someone who wanted to save this Tutsi wife was required to show great enthusiasm in the killings. Someone who behaved weekly or timidly new is all over for his wife. Grousing or idleness doomed her.

Speaker 2:          00:55:13       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:55:14       dove, you even complained and they talk about, I wonder the other killers talking about how it was easy to kill her, the street, the strangers. It was much better to kill strangers and acquaintances because acquaintances had time to stab you with an intense look before receiving the blows. I look from a stranger pierce to your mind or memory less easily, but there were some that obviously seem to enjoy this. Some amused themselves with their machetes on the Tutsis to show off their skill to everyone. They would swagger around boasting later in the evening. Some slowed down their machetes just for punishment. If a Tutsi you'd worn out a pursuer in a running chase, he could be teased with the point of a machete. It would be nasty for him. It was like demonstrating the bad example except that no one was left alive to notice.

Speaker 2:          00:56:38       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:56:41       and obviously when you have families, you have children and we have children, you have babies and here's one of the killers talking about the treatment of the babies, saving the babies. That was not practical. They were whacked against walls and trees or they were caught right away, but they were killed more quickly because of their small size and because they're suffering was of no use. They say that at the church they burned the children with gasoline. Maybe it's true, but that was just in the first day turmoil after that afterward. That did not last. In any case, I noticed nothing more. The babies could not understand the why of the suffering. It was not worth lingering over them.

Speaker 2:          00:57:40       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:57:41       and as I mentioned earlier, some of the kids were part of the killing. And here's one of the killers talking about that many children killed some save, the were sickened by it, scared of it, but we're forced to cut by their mamas are papa's most are completely silent when they hear talk of the killings even from years ago, keeping silent blocks, both judgment and change. Now, to add to the evil of all this, to add to the, to the end, comprehensible nature of it all, it's, it's, it's almost just unbelievable nature. But on top of all this, these people were Christians. They were Catholics. They were, they were church going people that were transformed almost instantly into murderers.

Speaker 2:          00:59:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:07       And here's one of those, one of the killers talking about that transformation that Saturday after the plane crash was the usual choir rehearsal day at the church. We sang hymns in good feeling with our Tutsi. Are Voices still blending in the chorus on Sunday morning we were, we returned at the appointed hour for mass. They did not arrive. They had already fled into the bush in fear of reprisals driving their goats and cows before them. That disappointed us greatly, especially on a Sunday. Anger hustled us outside the church door.

Speaker 2:          00:59:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:51       We left the Lord and our prayers inside to rush home.

Speaker 2:          00:59:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:58       We changed from our Sunday best into our work a day clothes. We grabbed clubs and machetes. We went straight off to kill him. Here's another killer. I was a deacon, the one who made arrangements for the Christian gatherings on the hill in the priest absence. It was I who conducted ordinary services during the killings. I chose not to pray to God. I sense that it was not appropriate to involve him in that the white priest took off. At the first skirmishes. The black priests joined the killers or the killed God kept silent and the church is stank from abandoned bodies. Religion could not find its place in our activity for a little while, we were no longer ordinary Christians. We had to forget our duties learned in catechism class. We had, first of all, to obey our leaders and God only afterward very long afterward to make confession and penance when the job was done again. Aye. Aye.

Speaker 2:          01:01:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:29       It's just, it's, it's, I didn't know if, if I could give this book to bring people here to this place.

Speaker 2:          01:01:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:43       And to me, this part that I'm about to go through is,

Speaker 2:          01:01:49       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:01:50       about as dark as it gets in the marshes. You heard no children's cries, not even murmurs. They waited silently in the mud. It was really something when we uncovered a woman with a nursing, the infant would not even whimper.

Speaker 2:          01:02:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:11       It was miraculous, so to speak. Many Tutsis, no longer to be spared. That was how they greeted death among themselves. They had stopped hoping. They knew they had no chance for mercy and went off without a single prayer.

Speaker 2:          01:02:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:39       They knew they were abandoned by everything, even by God.

Speaker 2:          01:02:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:45       They no longer spoke to him at all.

Speaker 2:          01:02:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:49       They were leaving in suffering to join him and no longer asked him for anything. Not Comfort, not blessing, not welcome. They no longer prayed even to drive away the fear of an agonizing death. It was two astounding. It was unnatural. Even animals that know nothing of pity, nothing of anguish, nothing of evil. They cry out terribly at the moment of the fatal blow. That mystery drove us to many discussions. We saw explanations for these Tutsis who went often to death without breaking their silence. That could frighten us sometimes at night because it was said that such calmness must be a bad omen from heaven and here's the one to the other killers talking about that silent death from the Tutsis when the Tutsis were caught, many died without a word. In Rwanda, people say die like a lamb and the Bible.

Speaker 2:          01:04:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:07       Of course, in Rwanda there are no sheep, so we have never heard their cry. It's sometimes touched us painfully that they awaited death. In silence evenings we would ask over and over, why no protest from these people who are about to leave? Why do the beg for mercy? The organizers claim that the Tutsis felt guilty for the sin of being Tutsi.

Speaker 2:          01:04:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:35       Some kept saying they felt responsible for the misfortunes they had brought upon us. Well, I knew that was not true. The Tutsis were not asking for anything in those fatal moments because they no longer believed in words. They had no more faith in crying out like frightened animals, for example, howling to be heard above. The mortal blows and overpowering sorrow was carrying those people away and they felt so abandoned.

Speaker 2:          01:05:15       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:05:15       they did not even open their, and while all that was happening, where were we? Like I said, I mean, I was in a seal platoon on that ship. We were had assets in the Marine Corps did, like I said, something small. They got authorization, but it was tiny in comparison and it was to hear them, to hear the killers talk about that. Here's, here's what one of them said. All the important people turned their backs on our killings, the blue helmets, the Belgians, the white directors, the black presidents, the humanitarian people and the international cameraman, the priests and the bishops. And finally, even God, did he watch what was happening in the marshes? Why did he not stab out our murderous eyes with his wrath or show some small sign of disapproval to save more lucky ones? A knows horrible moments who could hear his silence? We were abandoned by all words of rebuke.

Speaker 2:          01:06:56       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:06:56       And I'm gonna close from the book with this statement from one of the survivors before I knew a man could kill another man because it happens all the time. Now I know that even the person with whom you've shared food with whom you've slept, even he can kill you with no trouble. The closest neighbor can turn out to be the most horrible. An evil person can kill you with his teeth. That is what I've learned since the genocide.

Speaker 2:          01:07:42       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:07:43       And my eyes no longer gaze. The same on the face of the world. My eyes no longer gaze. The same on the face of the world.

Speaker 2:          01:08:02       What?

Speaker 1:          01:08:05       What can we take away from this? This blogger madness?

Speaker 2:          01:08:13       Yeah, we have to learn something. We have to gain something. But what? What is it?

Speaker 1:          01:08:26       And as I tried to answer that question for myself, I thought about something that I say and something that I know and this made it even more clear that there is evil in the world. There is darkness and it exists and it's real,

Speaker 2:          01:08:53       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:57       And it comes from us. It's human. It is people. We are evil,

Speaker 2:          01:09:09       okay?

Speaker 1:          01:09:10       It wasn't a, it wasn't a monster that murdered all those people, those men and those women and those children and those babies. It wasn't an animal or some force of nature like a tornado or a hurricane or a tsunami,

Speaker 2:          01:09:29       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:30       And it wasn't Satan and it wasn't some mysterious evil spirit.

Speaker 2:          01:09:39       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:09:40       it was us. And that that is downright horrifying. But there is a counter that, there is a dichotomy to that,

Speaker 2:          01:10:03       okay?

Speaker 1:          01:10:06       And that is the fact that wall, we are the evil in this world. We are also the good, we are the light that counters this darkness. And it sickens my heart to know that we did nothing while this happened. And I was there, I was off the coast, I was on deployment in my platoon, was one quick helicopter flight away. And maybe we could have helped. Maybe we could have saved even just one person, one child or one mom or one baby. We could have made some kind of difference. But we didn't, we didn't get the order. And so we sat while this evil unfolded and I'm ashamed of.

Speaker 2:          01:11:17       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:11:19       because you see, we all have the capacity to bring light into the world, to counter the darkness. All of us do in some way, maybe, maybe not directly, maybe not face to face with evil, but we can help. All of us can help. So the message I take away from this abject horror, to me, it's that I need to focus, that we need to focus on what good we can do to help people who can, who can we help? How can we help get better? Who can we improve, help improve their station in life? What threatened person can we defend? What oppressed person can we free? What person, what, what fellow human being can we remove from the grip of fear? Who can we, who can I, who can we? What person out in the world can we take from the darkness? And bring into the light. And that's the question and the answer that I brought away from this. And I know that this was a heavy, heavy book cover and I, like I said, I don't just want every time that you turn on this podcast to get crushed with something like this,

Speaker 1:          01:13:17       I don't want to dwell on it. And then I've got some good positive books I want to look at next, but I don't want to ignore this kind of thing either. Because as I've said before, you can't appreciate the light if you don't understand the darkness.

Speaker 1:          01:13:43       And as I said, this is truly about as dark as it gets. A little bit heavy Heiko yeah, yeah, I'd say so. Yeah. I gave echo a heads up three or four days ago and I said, hey man, I'm not quite sure about this one. This is going to leave a mark. And I truly debated whether or not to go forward, you know, because there were some people that even, or even about the, even about the forgotten Highlander, there were some people that said, hey, you know, that's just too much. You know, that's just too much and this is, this is, this is completely beyond that because the, the, there is no rhyme or reason. I mean at least you could look at a Japanese imperial soldier and say, Hey, he's a sick person that's doing something for this. Cause there was, there was nothing here. No rhyme or reason that was just slaughter kids and beat. That's, that takes it to a whole nother level and just how they talk in detail about how they deal with the kids. Yeah. Then again, to me, the,

Speaker 1:          01:15:12       the thing I took away from it as this sort of personal responsibility that we all have to help out other humans. And again, I understand that everyone's not going to be in the military, out on the front lines, fighting against, you know, tyranny and evil. I understand that. But what can you do to help out? And I've said this since day one, I was wondering, one of the things I talked about in this podcast is, you know, I don't feel like I'm really good at helping, you know, people with causes and stuff like that. I just don't feel it. I don't feel like it's something I'm very good at. But this makes you rethink and say what, what? You know, what can you do to help? Because there's people that are suffering. I mean obviously right now we've got, you know, we got isis better doing the same activities if not worse. They just do just crucified a priest that was just in the news. So the evil is still there and it is happening before our own eyes.

Speaker 2:          01:16:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:16:16       It makes me, it makes me sick that we, with the ability to do something about it, we sit on the sidelines. So hopefully we start to move in a direction where we take a leadership role in the world and help lead the world towards the light fade away from the darkness.

Speaker 2:          01:16:51       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:16:54       And with that thought, let's move away from the, this darkness right now let's talk about something else. Not to forget about this, but

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       we do have to recognize that we got to live our lives and people got to live their lives. And again, don't deny that this stuff is out there. Don't forget that this stuff is out there. Relish your situation. If you're, if you have a MP, three player of some kind and you're listening to this podcast, be thankful. Be Thankful that you're in that situation and look down below you into the darkness. And if you get the chance, put out your hand and see if there's someone down there,

Speaker 2:          01:17:45       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:17:46       That you can help pull up. So, uh, out of that heaviness and out of that darkness, let's head into a little bit of light now with, uh, the community questions and questions from the troopers out there. I've got questions for us and

Speaker 2:          01:18:08       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:18:09       You know, before we talk about the, uh, before we go to questions from the inner webs, what can we do from the interwebs supporting the OP podcast style? Yeah, well it depends on your mission, but in the event of you wanting to support this podcast in any capacity, um, well it's a bunch of things you can do. You can uh, do your Amazon, Amazon shopping. Like if you want to get that book, you want to buy this book right here, which you should cause shitty season. Cause it's an eye opener. I don't know though. I don't know. It might not be for everybody. I'm telling you. If you're a human, you should know about what the world is like. I did get machete season. Yeah, right there. If you want to get that, for example, through Amazon, just click through the link that is on Jocko podcast.com or Jocko podcast. [inaudible] dot com or Jocko store. And by the way, if you want to buy anything from Amazon and you click through that link, little some goes to the podcast, right? Yeah. So you're kind of passively supporting. Um, also, you know what, you know what I didn't realize earlier today we have shirts.

Speaker 2:          01:19:18       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:19:18       Jocko podcast shirts there. You know there are a couple of designs. I've never mentioned it. I posted a picture on Twitter before, like a couple of pictures on Twitter. That's it. I'm never mentioned it. So that's another way to support the podcast. Yeah, get yourself, get yourself a shirt. But there's a, if you just look at the shirts there at Jocko, store.com, look at them. If you like it, if you like one of them or, or both the designs or whatever, get a shirt, you don't like them, don't get the shyness. That's simple enough. Yup. There it is. And then of course on it, he's a supporter of this podcast, o n n I t.com/jocko and get 10% off anything on it is where we alpha brain

Speaker 5:          01:20:09       to fuel this podcast. And we're Jacobi's amongst the buildings. Yeah. A bunch of other stuff. Cool stuff and quality legitimate stuff. I think that's a big deal because a lot of times like you can take protein supplements or something like that and it won't work, but you won't really even know. You want to get to clean stuff. Yeah. You want to get the good stuff. And this, and I've mentioned this before, you can get caught up on that website reading all the interesting stuff, like how they get this and how they get these ingredients, all that stuff. Um, which actually isn't a bad thing because you know now, but, um, nonetheless it's all right there. You can, uh, you can read about all the supplements that you're thinking about getting. I recommend shroom tech sport as always. If you're going to do hard stuff that's like extended in a hard like Jujitsu or you know, across it situation or that kind of stuff. She always called a crossfit situation yet as if it's on, that's going to occur like crying. I appreciate that. O n n I t.com/jocko 10% off free shipping except for the exercise, the heavy exercise stuff. Oh yeah, there it is. Awesome. It's got some questions going. Okay. First Question Jocko, can you tell us your views on Brazilian Jujitsu competing mindset and training leading into a competition?

Speaker 3:          01:21:31       Well, competing is great. Competing makes you better. Competing points out your weaknesses. Competing lets you roll against people that you've never trained with before that are going to go 1000% against you and remove matters in competition. Yes, they bring it. Uh, I competed a ton back in the early days. Um, you know, you know, really, I'll just talk about dean because Dean and I were, were teammates back then and still are, but we competed all the time and we competed in the old school tournaments. The uh, the grappling games, they used to have those, the, the, the Pan American submission grappling. It was sorta like some offshoot or another competing sort of Pan Am's type situation. Uh, my, my, there was the, the Jo Marie era tournaments back in the day. Those were pretty cool. And uh, the Copa Pacifica, I think I did a few of those back in the day, but by my favorite was doing the neutral grounds tournament's cause those were like held up in La up in the hood somewhere and we'd roll in, it'd be kind of underground and those were really cool competition. So, but competed a ton back in the day. Um, once, honestly once September 11th happened, that was now my focus more than anything else. And I needed to be ready and need to be ready. I couldn't be having a blown out knee. I couldn't be having a hurt shoulder. So, and furthermore, I had like less time to focus and have real, like, let's call it a training camp to be ready to compete at a high level. And I mean, I was at a high, you know, I mean, I was,

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       I was, you know, a brown belt or black belt at the time. And so it wasn't like you could just show up the weekend warrior and jump in the jump on the mat with a, you know, some, some other black belt and it was going to go easy for you. It wasn't gonna Happen. So I didn't, you know, the bottom line is I needed to be 100% for the job. Uh, but competing is awesome. It's intense. No matter what you do in training, you cannot get a person as fired up as they are going to be in competition. It's not gonna happen. So it's really good to, to compete. So you find out what your weaknesses, you find out what it feels like when someone's going psycho on you because they're going to be going psycho. And to prepare for them, you know, you gotta you got to, my favorite thing to do prepares, you know, you get guys where they're going.

Speaker 4:          01:23:51       Got Fresh people coming on. Yeah. Because everybody can be destroyed when fatigue rolls in and starts getting, playing a role in the situation. It's been, it's good, it's bad. So when you bring in a fresh person, you know, after every two minutes, three minutes, four minutes, one minute, six minutes. But one person is, is, is fighting the whole time and other people are getting arrested and coming in. That's very challenging. It makes you rely on your technique. It pushes you beyond your normal limits and it's an awesome way to do it. So that being said, you also can't just do that all the time because you have to train your explosiveness as well and you need to be ready to do, you know, if you're doing a seven minute fight, you need to be able to go hard for seven minutes. And not save everything for a 38 minute fight, which is what you sometimes end up doing in the gym.

Speaker 4:          01:24:36       I do that all the time in the gym. I'm doing yo six rounds, seven rounds, you know, nine rounds, whatever the case may be. And you're also doing just one round, but it's one round that's 23 minutes long. Yeah, that happens too. So I like to do a little bit of all those things and but yeah, compete, get yourself better and it'll, it'll definitely make you a better Jujitsu player, which will make you a better person. And you see that pressure, you don't want another tactic which is, which is kind of good. And Jeff will do this sometimes he'll do like a three minute round. Yeah. So it's strange because when you know there's only three minutes that you kind of get that illusion that I'm just going to go all out and we'll see how many, if I can get this guy, I only have three minutes to get them.

Speaker 4:          01:25:20       And so you're to heart until your sense of urgency is more than if you have an eight minute route for your prep. But here's the, here's the little, and I dunno if Jeff did this on purpose but purpose, it's kind of this little trick where you're going hard but he only gives us 30 seconds in between. So it's, it doesn't matter if it's the three main area and you're going like six rounds. Yeah. So you're like, and so that will test your conditioning but it'll test like your quickness and not quickness like quick, but your urgency, you know, you're not going to be just chilling in some guys guard or you know, cause cause it's, you can fossil to chill in the guard. You can, yeah. In fact that's actually a good strategy in some cases. You know, when you got every cover or something like this. Anyway, that's interesting one that I to realize when

Speaker 5:          01:26:03       Jeff put it on us one day. Love. Yes. Okay, next question. Yeah, let's do it. Okay. I hurt myself significantly throwing a roundhouse kick recently abdominal hernia at the site of an old appendix surgery. I trained MMA five days a week, sometimes more and multiple times a day for two years until last week when he got that injury. But now I can hardly sit in a chair without pain in surgery is two months out. And who knows how long recovery recovery will be. Um, before I can train again, what I'm asking is what should we as martial artists in men do in times of forced hiatus an injury? What do we do when there's a quiet, but we miss the storm? Well,

Speaker 3:          01:26:56       one thing with injuries, injuries are going to come and you cut. Would you get saw dust, you train, you're going to get injured. That's what's going to happen. I mean, it's just a, that's just, this is the law is the law of the land. The number one thing to remember is, and this is something that's really hard, when you're super active and you're super fired up and you're training all the time, when you get injured and you get sidelined, you feel like it's never gonna go away. It feels like it's not healing. And you're just like, oh man, this is, I'm doomed. So the, the injury is going to wick go away. Now obviously for some guys, for some, for some actual soldiers or warriors that had been wounded in a permanent way, that's, that's different. And those guys, what they do is they learn to adapt.

Speaker 3:          01:27:40       You know, they learn how are they going to get through this? How are they gonna adapt their life? How are they going to roll with one leg? How are they going to do pull ups with one hand? Uh, Jeffrey Owl, you know Jeffrey out. Yup. We're doing a burpee pull ups. The other day I was putting the MMA classes through it. If you don't know Jeffrey l awesome guy, awesome fighter, awesome Jujitsu player. He's born without one hand. I had the guys doing a burpee pull ups and black belt by the way. Yeah. Black belts. And he had uh, he has like a little hook he can put on there to do pull ups and I guess the thing was fallen off. And so he just threw that thing to the ground and he was just hooking his, his forearm over and then the other hand was grabbing.

Speaker 3:          01:28:19       He's doing pull ups. Yeah. I mean if, if Jeffrey owl can just jump do, we did, I don't know, six rounds worth of burpee pull ups or five rounds worth of burpee pull ups. He, and he crushed it. No one has any excuse. So guys that they get some kind of a permanent injury, they get wounded. W something like that happens. Okay. You got to adapt to it. You've got to figure out what you can do. But the injuries, the, the basic injuries, the daily injuries, the, the temporary injuries that is normal from training that that's you're going to get them. And so of course, oh, you got an injury. Good. Right. It's a little injury. Be Thankful. It's not something worse. You know, I, I've, I've had, you know, a blown out ankle. I've had a torn MCL and you know, what do you do? What do you say when you tear your ACL or your MCL, you say, okay, awesome. Yeah, I did. It's not my ACL, it's not my meniscus. You know, the MCL will he itself, what do you say? If it's your, if it is your ACL. Okay, great. That's one that can be repaired with surgery. So none of these problems are permanent, right? So be thankful you don't have a permanent injury.

Speaker 2:          01:29:30       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:29:31       And even though it seems like it's going to take forever, like homeboy here, who's got two months before he even gets surgery and then how long is it going to take? It seems like it's going to take forever. I had neck surgery, right? That was a blip on the radar, if you remember how long it took. And it was a long time. I mean, it took months to heal from that. I don't remember that when I do, during that time I did other exercises. I figured it out. This stuff. I watched youtube videos, I figured out all the moves, you know? That's what I did. So I guess youtube wasn't even around. I was watching DVDs, GGT, DVDs, VHS tapes. So what do you do? Number one, stay active. Right? You know, move. Do, if you, if you can't move your body all work your forearms.

Speaker 3:          01:30:14       Strength, right? Squeeze a tennis ball. One of my buddies blew out his knee. What is it? The triple threat. He did ACL, PCL, meniscus, boom. He'll hook right, didn't tap, got to adapt to the heel hook people got attached to it, got caught on a hill. It didn't tap blue is blue. It all apart. He was in a, he had to get them all reconstructed. So he, we had a dummy. Remember the big dummy we have at the gym? We had a big one, it was 120 pounds and he would lay on the ground. His knee is in a four, has legs and a fourth street brace won't bend at all. He would lay on the ground and in lay next to this dummy and he just pull it from one side of himself, put it on the ground, on the other side of itself, pull it back to the other side, back to the other side, back to the other side. So he's getting this motion of sort of turning on the ground, this massive core strength. And when we, when he finally recovered, it was powerful. You know what, he would turn underneath. You said you got some, got some strength there. So you've got to figure out what you can do. You know, if you can't roll,

Speaker 2:          01:31:17       yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:31:17       box. If you can't box lift, if you can't lift, stretch and get that flexibility working in some area that you're not flexible, what? Whatever you're going to do. Stay engaged. Stay active. Because I think I'm definitely a believer in the active rest. You know what I mean? When you just go, okay, I'm injured, so I'm just gonna sit on the couch and watch TV. No wrong answer. Runaway from that TV, you got to keep moving because that keeps your blood flowing and it keeps getting, it gets more blood, more circulation, more healing gives to this area that's injured. So do that. And if you're still, you're still gonna have more time in your day, right? So what are you going to do? I'll tell you what you're gonna do.

Speaker 2:          01:31:57       Okay?

Speaker 4:          01:31:58       Get a guitar, right? Learn to play guitar. Write a book, build a website, take pictures, learn a language, read more books. Expand your brain, right? Expand your mind when your body needs a little recovery. When your body's injured, make yourself smarter, make yourself better, free your mind. And so the bottom line, the question was, what does a man do when there's quiet? And I'll tell you what a man does when there's quiet, he takes advantage of it. So take advantage of it. Get Smarter, get better. You know the ways and when the body comes back you'll, you will be better. Yeah. That's a good way to put it. Like take advantage of it. Like actively. Cause a lot of times like where the problem comes about. I know this because when I told I told my bicep. That's right. I wasn't there. I was watching the out.

Speaker 4:          01:32:52       Yeah. Well yeah. Thank you. Yeah, I was fine. I have a picture of you. Yeah. That was laying on the ground. That was messed up. I think you sent me a smarmy techs or something like that. No, that was for something else. But the same day though, nonetheless, what, where the problem comes when you miss the story, you miss the action is you're harping on it. It's almost like you have this hope like, oh, it'll be stolen. Or maybe the doctor said nine months, but maybe I could do it in four kind of thing. You know, they just, that mindset where you kind of in a way got admit to yourself, okay, I'm, I'm out right now. I can't roll right now. I can't train MMA two times a day, five days a week. I cannot do that. You got to admit that. So where did you go?

Speaker 4:          01:33:34       Did you work on your video editing skills during that time? Oh man, that was, I think that was before, or what'd you do? I forget. I don't know, but I'll tell you, do not take it. Tell you what I didn't do is harp on it. He moved on and you figured out what else you can do. Yeah, exactly right. In my back, I was always into working out and stuff, so I would do other stuff like legs and stuff. Like your left arm. Hello? Yeah. Yeah. Actually my left arm is still bigger a little bit. Nonetheless. I think that that's, that's a good little jumpstart is don't harp on it and you got to admit to yourself that you're, you're out. You're injured right now. So, and then how you said take advantage of it. Dang, that's good. I wish I would've known that. Actively take advantage because there's so much advantage to be taken.

Speaker 4:          01:34:15       There's all kinds of time you have. Yeah, man. I think about all the time that I spend in the gym and all the maths. I mean that's a budge big chuck of time. Now like with, with reading for example, it got back into reading and um, look, I look at it this way where as far as books go, books that exist, any information in the whole, whether you're interested in it, not interested, whether you can understand it or not, all the information of the world is accessible right now, especially more than anytime ever. All different angles, different aspects of everything is just out there and you have more time now. Take advantage of that actively. Actively. All. Alright, next question.

Speaker 5:          01:35:00       My question is this, as a military man, what do you do if you can not reconcile the orders that you're asked to do? I know that in your book you talk about believe the mission and how you must ask questions until you believe what happens if after all the questions and all the expectation as explanations that you don't agree or believe. What if the policies, the politics asks of you something you're not congruent with. How do you as a military men respond to you're incongruent see

Speaker 3:          01:35:31       with the mission. So this is a great question and, and, and

Speaker 3:          01:35:43       you know what's kind of ties in with what we just read with the book review of Machete sees and how people were just doing it. Some of them didn't believe in what they're doing. They did it anyways. Wrong answer. Um, Danny resulted in the death of the one guy, you know, you talk about her, the, that's in the book, but you know, so first of all, as you, as you stated in the question itself, if you don't agree with some mission that you've been given, then you have to ask the question why in the book extreme ownership, we talk about that. The primary example is we talk about is working with Iraqi soldiers. And how that's very challenging and very difficult and very dangerous. And the story that we tell in the book is that I, I said to myself, okay, why are they having us work with, he's Iraqi soldiers, my guys are going to be at risk, et Cetera, et cetera. And eventually I realized why we needed to do this was because if we didn't get the Iraqi soldiers to a point where they could handle the security in Iraq, then who's going to do it? And the answer was us. So I understood why. Now I actually don't even have to ask anybody why I figured that out. I asked myself why and so I was able to come to it, come to that conclusion. But when you are a part of something,

Speaker 2:          01:36:56       okay

Speaker 3:          01:36:57       with whether it's in business, awards in war, the goal, the ultimate goal, it has to be aligned and in it. So for example, we're in Iraq, we're supposed to use Iraqi soldiers. Okay. Do you think that the generals wanted our med to be killed because of the, the higher risk? No, they wanted to win the war. They want to keep our guys safe. So that's what I want it to. We want to win the war. We want to keep our guys safe so that's aligned. So anything that they're telling me to do, it must be at some point in the distance aligned with the same goal that I have. And it's the same thing with a business. Do you think a boss of a business doesn't want to be profitable or doesn't want to be ethical? No. Somewhere in the future they want to be profitable and they want to be ethical and somewhere your mission is going to align with that. If you don't, if those don't align at some point, then you've got a real serious issue on your hands. Right? Because maybe you're being told to do something that you just don't believe in at you at first. You know, like I said, you've got to ask those questions all the way up and if you do ask those questions all the way up and you still find, okay, I don't believe in this mission.

Speaker 3:          01:38:15       Now you got a way out. The consequences. Because,

Speaker 3:          01:38:21       for instance, if there is an order that comes and for whatever reason you don't believe in it, and you've asked the questions and you still don't believe that it's the right thing to do. But what if it's something that's like pretty inconsequential, right? Something that's no big deal and you say no to it. Like I'm not going to do this. You decide to make your stand, okay, well now you are your, first of all, you're not supporting the chain of command anymore. And if you're not supporting your chain of command anymore, how can you support the guys that work for you?

Speaker 2:          01:38:52       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          01:38:54       Because now, now you might get removed and if you get removed from the situation now, who's going to go execute it? Who's going to go do this thing that you thought was wrong? Now you're going to give it to somebody that might execute it in a harsher way, in a worse way or, or you lose control of it. You've lost your influence, your use of some of your political capital. You've impaired your reputation by saying, no, I'm not gonna do that because I don't believe in it. Well, what was it? And by saying, no, what did you accomplish? Because now you have no control over in, the more you're, you're, you can't change it, you can't affect it any more. So let me ask you this. This is an example. This will make it very clear what I'm trying to say, cause I don't think I'm being very clear right now. If you're playing a game, right? You're playing a football game or a basketball game and the ref makes a bad call. Okay? So you say ref made a bad call. I don't agree with this call. I quit. I'm walking off the court

Speaker 2:          01:39:56       now.

Speaker 3:          01:39:58       Does that make sense? I mean, how bad of a call was it? How did it affect the game? And, and furthermore, once you walk off the court, what good are you? Can you, can you do better? Can use, try and bring back the score. Can you try and show the ref that yes, you are playing fair. Look, I'm a good guy and keeping my head. I'm keeping my cool. Now you've thrown that all away. You've thrown that all the way. And so what good is that? It's the same thing and not to the ref, cause that's sort of outside your chain of command. But what if your own coach, what if your coach pulls you out of a game or a coach calls a play to you for you to run a play that you didn't believe in? So you're going to say, you know what? I don't believe in that play. I'm walking off the field. That's an exact correlation to this idea, right? This military order comes down that I don't believe in. Oh, I don't believe in it. So now I'm going to walk away.

Speaker 2:          01:40:45       Right? So

Speaker 3:          01:40:49       that is is problematic because you've, you've given up, you've surrendered your right to affect the situation.

Speaker 2:          01:40:59       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:41:00       And that's, that's not good. And in the military there's all kinds of little, you know, policy nuances that we might not believe in 100%, little things. There might be little things that you go, you know what? I don't, I don't see, I don't think that's the best way to do it. Or I think there's a better way to do it. But if you walk away from it now, you can no longer affect it and that is bad. So generally speaking, for most of these things you, I dealt, dealt with in the military all the time, dealt with it all the time. And you know what? Generally speaking, you stay in the game so that you can still have an effect and can still have influence. Now that being said, there can be orders that are on lawful or unethical. That can't happen, right? If you are in a bad situation, you're working for a bad commander, you're working for someone that's unethical or whatever the case may be. It may be their orders are plans that are tactically on the sound to the point that you're afraid people are going to die.

Speaker 3:          01:42:09       And, and in those situations, you know, as we were rolling back to Napoleon's maximum, again, if you knew, execute something that you knew was wrong, you're comparable. So that is a time when you stand up and say, you know what? I'm not doing this. You want to send me to Leavenworth? Do you want to demote me, demote me, do it. But I did not believe in this. And here's why. So that is a time where you may have to say, after you weigh out the situation, how bad is it? Something that's unethical, unconstitutional, and you think you're going to have a bigger impact by protesting it by possibly jeopardizing your career or possibly going to go on 11 worth. If you're in the military, getting court martialed, all those things could happen if you think that it's so important and that you will have a better effect on it by making this protest because that's what you're doing.

Speaker 3:          01:43:00       You're now making a protest then okay, maybe that makes sense. So you've got like the Mei Lai massacre in Vietnam were horrible. Situation happens. And if you were a soldier that was there and said, you know what, I'm not doing this stop. And maybe maybe you do rest and court martialed maybe risk getting killed. But that's a situation where maybe you do it or maybe it's some mistreatment of civilians or something. But again, even with mistreatment of civilians, the u s military is not going to order the mistreatment of civilians. It's not going to happen, right? So if it is happening, it's coming from a rogue commander that's you're going to be able to destroy when you bring this situation to the, to the authorities or to the higher chain of command.

Speaker 3:          01:43:48       So again, you know, if getting wrapped up in some small nuanced thing, he mentions the Poli, the political, like if you're not politically congruent with, I don't know if you meant that split. Yeah. And again, when you're in the military, you're, you're not there to, um, worry about the politics of it. You know, you're there to carry out the politics. You're there to carry out the policy. Now if there's a Po, again, if the policy is agregious, right, right. If it's a green adjusts and you think you would do better to, to make a protest and end up in jail and you know, be on CNN and Fox News and saying, Hey, this is why I'm in jail because I didn't agree with what we're doing. If it's something that the rest of the nation is going to look at and say, yeah, this guy was right. Right, of course. Yeah. But if you're doing it because it's something that is in comparison to that is something relatively small.

Speaker 2:          01:44:47       Okay,

Speaker 3:          01:44:47       then you're probably, you're probably doing worse to help the situation. You're probably doing less good by walking away, getting off the field and letting, letting the, the situation transpire without your presence. I want to be there. Yeah. You know, I want to be there. If I, if my guys were getting tasked with a mission that I thought was a little bit sketchy, I want to be there. Yeah. I want to be there. Not, hey, I protest, so I'm not going to go [inaudible] not a good call. So, um, yeah, and, and again, I'm not saying that you don't stand by your principles, but what I'm saying is, especially if this guy that's in the military, your principles should be for the most part in line, this is America. And if you're, if you're, if you're being told to do something that's, that's UNAMERICAN, then yeah. Stand by your principles. But most, if it's something that's small and it's something that you just might not agree with, 100%, it doesn't mean you're an unprincipled person. It means that you are winning, losing the battle, but you're going to win the war. Yeah. Yeah. I liked that way. Weigh it out. You know, everything's not black and white. That bothers me. I'm jumping on the, you know, on that side of things.

Speaker 2:          01:46:04       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:46:06       Next question, Jocko and echo. What supplements do you guys take besides Krill oil and Alpha brain in d? Take the Alpha brain instant or capsules. I take Alpha brain instant. It's tasty treat. It's got a little statistic, which it's got a little sweetness to it, uh, cause it's got Stevia in it, so it tastes good. If you, if you have a little bit of a sweet tooth and wants something sweet and you've been eating like steak for the past seven days, mmm. Tastes good. I also take glucosomine as I've mentioned before. Uh, I do get it from on it. It's a product called strong bone. That's what I, that's what I take. And I'll tell you, I,

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       I the getting ready for the podcast, right. Doing prep work, like three days in a row, I was deep in prep work and I was pounding some, some Alpha brain and each, each dance. Yeah. I was like drinking the full Alpha brains and maybe like two of them. And, and I, I had directed the two days in a row and when I went into train and I trained with Dean deans getting ready for something right now, and I was rolling really good with Dean each day. I was, you know, I was doing well. He has, I was like, dude, it was doing well and dean was, Dean was not a happy camper. And then the third day was like, I was pretty much done with wrapped up the prep and I didn't have any Alpha and I had a rough day and I, I said to myself, maybe there's a little slot there.

Speaker 4:          01:47:43       Causation, I don't know, maybe, but, uh, yeah. And I suppose you want to throw out some shroom tech. Yeah. Shroom tech. Um, of course, like I've always said, um, again, even before this I was, I took from tech. That was good. That's a good one. Oh, the preworkout sometimes, you know, we'll actually all the time, if you, if you really want to feel like working out, you know, like, like, Hey, I feel like working out right now. You'll always feel like that. You feel like that takes some pre workout with the Alpha brain. Instant mix them together. Boom, Gatorade, boom. Yeah. Um, as far as the Alpha brain instant versus the capsules, and my brother has verified this, I'd never taken, I've taken the capsules, but not before I go to sleep. I hear that if you take the capsules before you go to sleep, cause I don't think there's like any kind of caffeine or nothing in Alphago.

Speaker 4:          01:48:36       There's not so take it before you go to sleep, you get 'em lucid dreams, lucid dreams. I've heard that. I've heard that from everybody. Everybody who takes Alpha brain, they say that it affects the dream. I don't want my dreams to be any more real than they are actually. But do you know that you're dreaming when you, when you saw three dream situation? Sometimes. Yeah. Apparently like this a little bit. A lot of times my dreams are just blank, but I wake up and you know, complete full athletic, sweat drenched bed. That's, that's how I wake up. It's not fun. Yeah. Um, but in regards to like protein powder or nothing like this, uh, steak. Yes. I said it before and I'll say it again. Yeah. I think that's a big deal. Like a lot of people, you know, people, some people were really into supplements like Toby. Yeah. The new, this, the new protein powder because it comes with this delivery system and all this stuff. Um, dual action protein. Yeah. You know, all this other stuff. And it does, um, like if you eat food that, yeah, just normal food that has a good delivery system that is to tell you that actually, especially when it's in the form of a Ribeye steaks and great delivery system right there. Yeah. I would imagine so. But yeah, that's it. Not that heavy into the supplements.

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       Um, maybe a multivitamin from time to time. Okay. I don't really take a multivitamin. Yeah. Yeah, I did for awhile. I don't anymore. Yeah. Um, Krill oil. Alpha brain. Yeah, it's it. Next question. I'm a Kentucky Trooper and I'm an instructor at our academy, the police academy. We lost three guys last year. Could you discuss how it, how to deal with training these guys as hard as you can and they still lose their lives while working. So it's the dealing with people and letting them know that um,

Speaker 2:          01:50:27       hm

Speaker 5:          01:50:29       that this goes down. Know How do you do with that?

Speaker 3:          01:50:34       Well, first of all, um, I eat a lot of feedback from police officers out there in the world and if I would say one thing to them to lead this office, thank you for what you do. You guys have a dangerous job. It's intense, it's thankless most of the time and you're dealing with the, with the dregs of society all day long. And then you have to balance that with dealing with normal civilians and citizens. So, uh, thank you for what you guys do. And also I'll throw on top of that. Firefighters, you know, paramedics. Thank you guys. For what you do. And again, thankless job, um, difficult job, dangerous job where people, you're helping people that don't want to help themselves in many cases. So thanks for everybody. Thanks for all those, those first responders for what you guys do. Yeah. Um, now as far as training guys hard and then you still get guys that get killed blessing. But let me ask you this. What is the alternative? Right? Well, what are you going to do? Not Train hard. Um, you know, I had the first deals that were killed in Iraq were killed under my command. There were my guys, mark, Mark Lee, Mikey Mon store and Ryan Job. And we trained as hard as possible and we still took those casualties. I'm telling you, we trained as hard as possible and if it wasn't for lack of training or lack of planning or lack of skill,

Speaker 2:          01:52:22       okay.

Speaker 3:          01:52:23       It's the nature of combat eats the risk of conducting operations in a hostile environment. And I'll tell you what, when I got back to America and I took over the training for the west coast seal teams, that fact, that fact of losing my guys in combat, it made me fanatical about trading. And I was already fanatical about training, but it multiplied it infinitely.

Speaker 2:          01:52:56       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:52:57       Because now it became my mission to prepare these guys, the apps to the absolute best of my ability and get them ready for combat. In part of that preparation was making them understand what was at risk. And I think that's something that you should do here.

Speaker 3:          01:53:19       You know, you don't know what's going to happen when you go into the field and you don't know when it's gonna happen. So everything you do should be to prepare yourself mentally and physically for the moment of truth. Whether that happens at a traffic stop or while you're serving a warrant and why you're stopping a bank robbery, you don't know when it is going to happen. And so you got to tell these guys, tell them the truth of the danger and let it sink in and hound on it. And I, I, I tell this story from time and I was telling you a story. It's a statement and it's because I remember this feeling. Then it was when I got back from Ramadi and we were doing, we'd be doing urban training and I would see a guy like standing in the street standing in the middle of the street, which is, which is not a good move, right?

Speaker 3:          01:54:12       That's where bullets fly down. You're going to get shot if you're in the Middle Street and it happen all the time to guys and Ramadi and I would see a guy that will be standing in the street and I would literally feel sick. It was only for about maybe six to nine months after I got back. When I'd gone to the training side, I would feel sick to my stomach. I would just feel this horrible feeling because it was like I was waiting for something to be, I was waiting for him to get shot and he felt horrible and I wore, my goal was to transfer that feeling into their heads. I wanted them to feel sick. I wanted them to feel embarrassed and feel guilty and feel angry and feel disappointed that they were doing something wrong because I wanted them to change their behavior, which would keep them alive. So I would say in this case, whew, you've got, you're putting people through training, valuable training, and of course there's still going to go out and do a dangerous job, but you don't back off the training, you train harder and you use these guys again. God bless him. You use these guys that were killed in action as an example of, hey guys, this is why we're training hard. This is why we're going to push. This is why I want you to take personal responsibility for and for

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       your training and for your skill set so that you're ready.

Speaker 2:          01:55:52       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:55:54       You train how you fight and you fight how you train. So take advantage of that and be ready.

Speaker 5:          01:56:07       Yeah. And a lot of times that, that pain of, um, you know, any kind of fail, in this case, it's an extreme case. Losing your guys. You know, you guys are going through these extreme cases, um, and that, you know, so there's a spectrum of, you know, of cases, but any kind of failure or, or, or mishap that causes any kind of pain.

Speaker 2:          01:56:27       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:56:27       You can, and it's not easy. It's not easy, but you can use that pain to facilitate your passion in a corrective way. You know, I was like, how you say train harder. You can take that pain and literally focus on good ways of training, training, hard, being attached to the results of training you're in or the process of training. Yeah. You know, and it, and it'll, you get essentially you can use that pain, you know? Absolutely. You, you get a guy that's an MMA fighter that loses to a submission hold, right. You take that and you say, okay, but you've got to work though Jujitsu. You take a guy that's gets his legs kicked out from underneath him. Okay, you got to work. You're more tired. So you take those painful training experiences and you put them, like you said, you put them to work. Absolutely. Yeah. In the, in a lot of times, a lot of times that'll come naturally a lot of times, but it doesn't always. So in those cases, you can just, just actively and consciously take that pain, you know, and, and redirect it. You can do it. You can do that fully, even if it doesn't come natural and it helps.

Speaker 2:          01:57:28       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:57:29       Okay. Jacqueline, any advice? Um, you have to continue to work out at 4:30 AM

Speaker 1:          01:57:35       but with two newborn twins at home because the struggle to stay awake and real. Awesome question. And, well, I have four kids. The first three of them were born in pretty rapid succession, not quite twins obviously, but you know, we had at one point we had three kids under three. So yeah, we're getting after it. And, uh, now part of that, I got to, in full disclosure, I, you know, I was, uh, deployed a fair amount, but when you got those young kids, here's what you gotta do, you gotta get it done. You got to get it done. And this idea that you're going to get it done on some pattern or some structured time schedule. It's gonna. It's gonna fall apart. Yeah, and you got to both sleep and working out and every other thing that you're trying to get done in your life, you have to make it happen when you can make it happen, right. You know you have to make it happen. When can make it happen,

Speaker 3:          01:58:41       there's going to be no ideal time. You might be working out at three o'clock in the morning. You might be working out at seven o'clock at night. You might be working out at midnight. You might be trying to sleep at noon. You don't know what's going to happen. I would definitely say when you got the young kids, get some kind of a home gym set up. At least get a pullup bar. At least get yourself a pullup bar. Because if you have a pull up bar, you can do everything. You can do pull ups. Then you can do push ups. You can do squats, you can do sprints. You can, you can make stuff work. If you at least have a pullup bar and then you just got to squeeze it in there. You know, it's a half an hour there. It's 20 minutes here, it's 15 minutes there. It's a power nap in the afternoon. It's some squats while you're sitting there holding a baby, trying to get the baby to fall asleep. That's what it is. It's the stroller to the park with a chalk bag. So when you get there, you can do some pull ups on the swing set. That's what it becomes because life is going to have a vote in these situations and your kids and your family

Speaker 3:          01:59:46       are more important than you are. And that's something that is a tough reality for the young dads to face. All of a sudden you are not the most important thing in the world at all. They are more important than you are.

Speaker 3:          02:00:08       That being said, which I know I'm supposed to, uh, pay some kind of a fine. When I say that being said, somebody on Twitter hassled me about it. That being said, so your kids are more important than you. Your family's more important to you. That being said, guess what? The number one thing you need to do for them, stay healthy. You got to stay healthy. You can't get all outta shape and turn into a bum just because you got kids. They're looking to you to be able to provide for them for a long time. They're also looking at you as an example. That's a big one. So you gotta be the right kind of example, and physical fitness is part of that example. So they should see that from day one. They should know big daddy's doing some squats while he's holding me [inaudible]. Now

Speaker 3:          02:00:56       I'm going to double down. That being said, this is not a time of your life when you have newborn twins that you're going to be in the optimal condition. You're not going to be at your peak performance. That's okay, right? That's okay. Hey man, you got things going on at you're a dad. You know you're not new. Dad would [inaudible] you're not going to be setting any of your prs on your, on your dead lift. Right? It's not going to happen. So, but, but that's not a reason that you fall apart at all. You got to hold the line as much as you can. You've got to balance this situation. Now you got a in dig in, you gotta be creative with your workout, with your rest, with your sleep. When the opportunity presents itself, whichever one of those is the priority, you've got to go and get it on and you know, it'll happen.

Speaker 3:          02:01:56       It's not just when you have newborn kids, it'll happen with your job. You'll, you'll get some pressure situation at work and all of a sudden you're going to, you got to squeeze it in. You know, I had, I bought houses over time and I would always buy these houses that were unlivable, right. Just on livable, just brand sack disasters because they were cheaper. And then I would go in and do these like speed remodels alone by yourself, by myself. But you know, for instance, I did a, I gutted a kitchen in one of my houses, gutted the kitchen and redid the whole kitchen, plumbing, electrical, new counters, the whole thing. And I got it. I didn't get the countertops in because that was like, you know, especially guys come in and do that. But 72 hours, 72 hours, nonstop work. When I moved into another house I had, we pulled up the carpet.

Speaker 3:          02:02:52       I thought there was these nice hardwood floors under the carpet, pulled up water damage. A third of the, a little bit more than a third of the phone was half the floor is water damage. So I had to yank those boards out and then saying this whole thing and it was a nightmare. It took me 72 hours of no sleep. I would sleep for 20 minutes waiting for the, the next layer of varnish to dry sitting there in the fumes. Right. But that's what you gotta do sometimes you got to be, like I said, a big project at work, something that's coming. Uh, and you got to figure out how to, what you can fit in, when you can fit it in and realize that there's benefit. There's benefit to that 20 minute little session. You just did go do a hundred burpees, right? Go swing a kettle bell, just go swipe.

Speaker 3:          02:03:38       I always talking about the other day we, I got Kettlebell, I got the, I got the, uh, the Zombie Bells, right? I got the Zombie Bells. You know, I have a garage gym. The Zombie Bells are in my house because I'm walking around. And sometimes you need to snatch a kettle bell too, right? Sometimes you go snatch a kettle bell. So, so you have that and that builds up because now you're just boom, you hit out. You know, you're not even breaking into a sweat, just hitting seven, seven each arm, you know, cannibal snatch. Maybe it's just, you're just doing that. Yeah. And so that's the kind of thing maybe, you know, with the newborn dad, you got to have that get to have that Zombie Bow Sydney House and he just to hit some snatches ready just to do some, some, some sumo dead lift, high pulse. Right. What's it going to be?

Speaker 3:          02:04:24       Make it happen. We'll get the pull up bar or, or a set of rings. Get the rings. Yeah. You know, something that you can, rings are great cause then you can do pull ups, you can do dips. They're very, very versatile, very versatile. But you're going to, the bottom line here is your life is going to change. It has changed. So it doesn't mean, and you're, you know what, your life has changed and it just got better. It just got better. So what you need to do is you need to adapt to the new situation and continue to drive the excellence. But the excellence isn't going to be served up all at once. The excellence is going to be served up in little chunks throughout the day day

Speaker 5:          02:05:12       where you can grab it. Yeah. And that's uh, that's the way it goes. Yeah. Another tip in, um, I am a twin. I don't have twins.

Speaker 3:          02:05:21       Yeah. If you don't know, uh, Echo Charles is a twin. And by the way, you've got some requests for the echos story. So maybe next podcast we can wear here. Echoes Story.

Speaker 5:          02:05:32       Yeah. Um, yeah, sure. I'll give you three minutes and 30 seconds for it. Good story. I thought I need, um, but no one, when I had my daughter and I'm, I'm pretty into working out, so you know, to not work out with kind of hard or not have the time, but here's the thing, I'm really into like the luxurious situation resting for a long time and getting ready mentally ready, like taking an hour and a half to get ready for what I was used to that. So that was a big, a big change to not have that much rest and not have to have that much time. So, and now you're doing Jocko podcasts, you get even less as less rest. Well, she's three now, so it's different. Um, but a thing that helps on top of everything you said, which is in my opinion, absolutely correct, 100%, um, to add to it is work with your wife or husband if you're a girl, you know, and your, and you guys have kind of communicate with them, tell them that, you know, working out in staying in shape is, is important to me or whatever or in a good way to put it is getting unhealthy at this time with our new kids is means a lot, you know, if I do that, like it means a lot to stay healthy.

Speaker 5:          02:06:48       Um, so you know, if you communicate that will help as well because you can work with each other. You know, how like, you know, when you have a new kids, um, it's kind of like one guy can, you know, capitalize on a rest time, you know, and then you know, the other guy will kind of stand, watch with the kids and the other, the other person can, can get rest. So if you communicate, that'll help your situation so much.

Speaker 3:          02:07:08       So I am guilty here of unintentional communications because if I, you know what, when, when, when my wife and I, when our kids were young, if I didn't work out, and quite honestly if I didn't train Jujitsu, I am guilty. I'm, yeah, I was, I, I wouldn't recognize, but it just would

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       really like frustrate me. Right. And so eventually she said, you know what, just get your stupid ass outta here and go train. Yeah. Because I'd rather just have you go, and that's when, that's when I, you know, we, I'd show up at the gym at eight o'clock at night, like Dean would be done teaching class and I'd come in there and we trained for 38 minutes, you know, just go in there, get it on and come home. So, you know, try not to do that where you're a jerk. Right. But there's something, I mean I talk about this all the time, that there is, there is a mind body connection that is undeniable. Yeah. For sure. And if you don't find a place to get that aggression out and get that the endorphins flowing and get the, the, the good feeling that you get from physical activity, then you're going to turn you and turn a little bit nasty.

Speaker 4:          02:08:26       That's not good. Yeah. And of course that, that I bet you a lot of relationships really suffer from that and people don't recognize it. I think so do I think in my experience from talking to people, okay, so, okay, but so that element, that element of, of exercising and it being interrupted by a new kids or something like that, that'll vary from person to person. Right. So you being all nuts because you can't train, you know, the next guy might not be that nuts. They might affect him maybe this much, it would be this much, you know, it's different m and a that goes along with what I said, like communicating, actively telling him like, you know, doing what you did but communicate. And at the same time, if you're aware of it, which it can be the hard part, if you're aware that you're just not as happy, just just know that.

Speaker 4:          02:09:15       So really kind of check yourself if you feel yourself losing your temporary, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm unhappy because I'm sacrificing a few training days. You're right. The red flag of that's, that's a great point. The red flag of, Hey, it sucks having kids. Yes. You have the red flag. The reason you're feeling that is because it's this part of that reasons because it's disrupting your physical activity. So recognize that and then do something about it. Yeah. Communicate with your spouse, you know, set up a plan. Get a pull up bar, get a kettle bell in the house. Yeah. Do and make it happen. Yeah. And the, I think that's a good point. Yeah. It's not going to be as luxurious as you know. You're not going to be optimum. It's not a time. And a lot of them will with me. That bothered me.

Speaker 4:          02:10:03       You know, not, it didn't, I didn't really pay much of a price, you know, as far as it bothering me when something bothers me, I don't like lose my temper typically, but I did feel that I'd be like, oh my gosh, I don't have that much time or I don't have the energy because they didn't get enough sleep and it was kind of annoying. But at the same time I did adapt and I got real good at um, you know, like the exercise like Jim Gymnast can do it like on a pommel horse or something or I'd go on the ground, I'd sit with my legs and feet out in front and you can live, he'll sit. Yeah. Yeah man, I got real good at doing that. But nonetheless, the doctor, the Jujitsu thing, um, two things. Yeah. Communicate, understand when you're starting to get a little irritated because he didn't, didn't train, understand that and then handle it accordingly.

Speaker 4:          02:10:50       That's a, on the flip side, if you have to recognize, okay this is a typical situation where now you have kids, yet you still want to go train Jujitsu, but your wife is like how, how can you reconcile going to train with your buddies? You know, cause a lot of times the girlfriend or the wife will think that that's just some, some fun and games and you know, in their mind they think it's another relationship you basically have going on but they don't understand the important of Gel. The bottom, the Jujitsu potentially. Yes. And it's the spectrum. So it's important to to, like I said, communicate and let them, let them know that it's not that, you know, and they don't always get it. I understand that. But if you just can communicate and effectively get the message that it is an important thing in life, hey listen Darlin what's important to you?

Speaker 4:          02:11:43       What's it you know, cause you never know what it is. Whether it's running, whether it's their biking or whether it's there, anything date night with their girls or whatever the case may be. That's what you've got. This is what I've got. I've got these two things. You have got to work out. I got to train some Jujitsu. Yeah. You know that's when I got to do. But beef be fair though. Like if you're going seven days a week before the kids and you still want to go seven days a week, three hours a day, understand that. Okay, you got kids not going to bring it down to like six.

Speaker 4:          02:12:11       I was really bad. Yeah I can see that. But it's in a way it's not fair, you know, like not only to your wife but to the fact that you have kids now. You know there's only so much Jocko Kingo around. Yeah I don't, I'm questioning whether I should tell this but I'm going to. So there was times where I would come home from, work in the seal teams work until seven o'clock at night, come home from work, walk through the door, drop my work bag and pick up my gym bag. My wife's there with three young kids and she would be looking at me with the expression of are you freaking serious? Cause you know, I'm only home for, let's call it four days, then I'm going on another trip and I'm home for three days. So those four days she's thinking, cool, he's home for four days, family time.

Speaker 4:          02:13:12       I'm thinking cool home for four days and nap time. And, but again, what she realized was that if she was to stop me, she's got a jerk in the house. Now, not, not even, I mean just, just, it just is. It's just the reality of it. I just would be really frustrated with the situation and all I want to do is just go train because it's part of who I am and I want to get on the mat and I want to get better and I want to, it's very selfish, right? I mean all of the reasons are selfish, but that be that, that, but the reality is that's, that's me. That's me. Yeah, that's me team. And you can't change your knee. Yeah, will, we'll, of course, of course. It's still gonna be you. But you know, this is going to sound real obvious and Cliche, but the whole compromise thing, when you guys have a bunch of kids, you got a compromise and don't be like, hey everyone else in the whole group.

Speaker 4:          02:14:18       By the way, the kids, even though you know your wife, everyone in the whole group, you guys compromise a factor of eight out of 10. Me, I'm just going to compromise the factor of 0.5 cause I'm still gonna go to Jiu Jitsu every single day for as long as I've done it. You know, do all the things that you've done before. You have kids, you can't do that. Yeah, I don't think you can do that. Yeah, no, you shouldn't do that. But I am saying yeah and I did. Yeah. And and sure. A lot of it because he's not aware. A lot of time you, you're not saying, you know what? I know I'm being a Dick Right now and you know what? I'm okay with being a Dick Right now. You know, and then I share a fault for not letting me train or whatever. Yeah. I guess I might not have been the best, the best husband and let scenario live and learn and, and it's, it's, I don't want to say it's good, but when you have new kids and especially twins, twins, it does allow you to kind of reconcile what's important.

Speaker 4:          02:15:18       You know, like let's say every Tuesday you went to Taco Tuesday or something like that and drank every Tuesday right before kids, now you've got twins. I'm like, man, I'm really how you get to honestly ask yourself, is that kind of stuff important now? No. Taco Tuesday's not important compared to kids. Yeah. No, but you could say time with my friends is important and all this other stuff, but the drinking and it just all little, little detailed things that you can easily go without. And in a lot of cases do better without, but their vices or whatever when you can, when you have twins or new kids or just kids in general, you do get that opportunity to reconcile what's more important. Yeah. You, you get to prioritize and execute. I'm sure for sure. All right. We haven't, congratulations twins. It's a big deal. Yeah. No doubt. I hope their hope, the names are echo in jeans. I mean what happened in the hall. Yeah. Jocko knowledge is a powerful tool to become knowledgeable. You must ask good questions. You have advice for asking

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       good questions. Yeah, I mean, knowledge is a powerful tool for sure. A, I mean it's, it's the master of tools, right? It's where all your tools come from.

Speaker 2:          02:16:49       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:16:50       Because without knowledge there's nothing, and you know, you take that one step further and really knowledge is, it's a weapon. It's the ultimate weapon in it trumps all other weapons, right? Fought is what wins the mind is what wins. The knowledge is what wins. And you absolutely,

Speaker 2:          02:17:16       you,

Speaker 3:          02:17:18       you, you gain knowledge by asking questions. Right? So my advice for asking questions is pretty simple. Question everything. Don't, don't just accept anything as truth. Question it all question everything. I tell my kids when they go to school to sit in the front of the classroom and when they, when they, when they don't understand something that's second, they don't understand something, just put your hand right up in there and say, I don't understand that. I understand that part. Can you go over that again? And that's how you need to be in life. That's how I try to be. Well, you don't understand a word. Break out a dictionary and look it up.

Speaker 2:          02:18:09       Okay?

Speaker 3:          02:18:10       If you don't understand the concept, break down the concept until you do understand it. Vina, know how something works. Dig into it until you do know how it works. Ask every question that comes to mind. And I'm not saying that you have to blurt out why, why, why, why this like a five year old and everything you see. But yes, ask those questions and learn and most importantly, question yourself. Question yourself every day. Ask Yourself, Oh, who am I?

Speaker 2:          02:18:52       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:18:53       What have I learned? What have I created? What forward progress have I made? Who have I helped?

Speaker 2:          02:19:05       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:19:07       What am I doing to improve myself today to get better, faster, stronger, healthier, smarter? Ask Yourself, is this what I want to be? This is this all I've got this, this, everything I can give. Is this going to be my life and do I except that you got to ask yourself those questions, those hard questions, and you've got to answer getting, answer them truthfully and you got to realize that all of us, all of us,

Speaker 2:          02:20:11       okay,

Speaker 3:          02:20:12       can do better. We can be better. You just got to take that first step and that first step is when you begin to ask those questions.

Speaker 2:          02:20:31       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:20:33       So advice on asking questions, ask the hard questions and ask the hard questions of yourself. Ain't in the answers to those questions is where you find that path, the path to progress and the path to freedom inside your mind. And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
