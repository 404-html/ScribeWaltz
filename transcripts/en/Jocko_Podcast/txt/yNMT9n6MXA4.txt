Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number one 62 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good evening. Good evening on the 22nd of April, 2008 to Marine battalions, the first battalion, Ninth Marines, the walking dead from Vietnam fame and the Second Battalion Eighth Marines. We're switching out pain. Ramadi, Iraq, one battalion going home in a few days and the other just starting, it's a seven month tour to marines, Corporal Jonathan Yale and Lance Corporal Jordan herder, 22 and 20 years old, respectively. One from each battalion. They were assuming the watch together at the entrance gate to an outpost that contained a makeshift barracks housing 50 marines. The same broken down, Ram shackled building was also home to 100 Iraqi police.

Speaker 2:          00:01:11       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:01:12       they were my men in this fight against the terrorists in Ramadi. Yale was a dirt poor mixed race kid from Virginia with a wife and a daughter and a mother and a sister who lived with them and he supported them as well. On $13,000 a year herder was a middle class white kid from long island. The two of them were from two completely different worlds in our country. Not good, not bad,

Speaker 2:          00:01:52       just different.

Speaker 1:          00:01:55       Had they not joined the marine corps, they would never have known each other. They would never have even understood that multiple America's exist simultaneously. Depending on your education level, your family's income status may be, but they were marines. They were combat marines and because of this bond they were brothers. As close as if they were born to the same woman, the mission orders they received from the sergeant there, squad leader. I am sure when something like this, okay, you two clowns stand this post and let know on authorized personnel or vehicles pass you clear on that. I'm also sure that Yale and hurt her then rolled their eyes and said in unison something like, yeah, sergeant, we got it. We know what we're doing.

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       Well,

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       just enough attitude that made the point without saying the words. No kidding sweetheart. We know what we're doing. They then relieved the two other marines on watch who turns out we're probably the two luckiest marines on earth that day and they assumed their post at the entry control point at joint security station. Nasser in the Sophia district of Ramadi, Iraq, a few minutes later, a large blue truck turned down the alleyway. The alleyway was no more than a hundred yards in length and spread its way through the serpentine of Juror Concrete Jersey walls. The truck stop just short of where the two were posted and detonated, killing them both catastrophic Lee, if you know what combat is like, you know what I'm talking about when I say catastrophic Lee, 24 brick masonry houses were damaged or destroyed by the blast. A Moscow hundred yards away collapsed. The truck's engine came to rest 200 meters away, knocking most of a building down before it stopped. Our EOD guys are explosive. Guys reckoned the blast was made of at least 2000 pounds of explosives.

Speaker 2:          00:04:43       Two died.

Speaker 1:          00:04:46       And because these two young infantry men didn't have it in their DNA to run from danger, 150 men, 50 us marines and a hundred Iraqis were saved. When I read the situation report about the incident and a few hours after it happened, I called the regimental commander and I asked him for details of what had happened. It seemed different to me. Unfortunately, marines dying or being seriously wounded is common in combat. We expect marines and for that matter, soldiers, sailors, airmen and coast guardsmen regardless of rank or mos to do their duty, to stand their ground and do their duty and to die if that's what the mission requires. The regimental commander had just returned from the site and he agreed with me, but reported that there were no American witnesses to the event, just Iraqi police. I figured if there was any chance of finding out what actually happened and then to recognize and decorate these two young marines and acknowledged their bravery, I'd have to do it myself because I understood that the bureaucrats back in Washington would never accept Iraqi statements for what had taken place. If getting these marines properly awarded had any chance at all, it had to come under my signature as a general officer,

Speaker 1:          00:06:34       so I traveled to Ramadi the next day and spoke individually to half dozen Iraqi police, all of whom told the same story. They said the blue truck turned down into the alley and immediately sped up as it made its way through the serpent, Teen Jersey walls. They all said they knew immediately what was going on.

Speaker 2:          00:07:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:00       Particularly as the marines began to fire.

Speaker 2:          00:07:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:06       The Iraqi police all began firing as well. Then to a man, they ran for safety. Just prior to the explosion. They all survived. Many more injured, some seriously injured. One of the Iraqi said to me that they had all run from the danger like any normal man would to save his own life. What he didn't know until then, what he learned that very day was that Americans are not normal with tears welling up. He said, sir, in the name of God, no sane man would have stood there and done what they done. No sane man. They saved all of us. What we didn't know at the time and what I didn't know at the time and only learned a couple of days later after I wrote a summary of this bravery and submitted it and submitted them both Yale and hurt her for the Navy crosses, which is the number two award for marines and sailors in combat. What I didn't know was that one of our security cameras that we had at the location that was damaged initially in the blast had caught everything. It had happened exactly as the Iraqis had described it to me.

Speaker 2:          00:08:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:54       It took exactly seconds by

Speaker 2:          00:08:55       that recording from when the truck entered the alley until it exploded

Speaker 1:          00:09:03       six seconds and you can watch, and I did watch many, many times on this recording the last six seconds of their young lives when it first started. I suppose it took a second or so for the Marines to separately come to the same conclusion about what was going on. They had no time to talk it over. Only enough time to take half an instant and think about what the sergeant had told them to do. Only a few minutes before, let no unauthorized personnel or vehicles pass. At that point in the recording, the two marines had about five seconds left to live.

Speaker 2:          00:09:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:58       It took maybe another two seconds for the two jar heads to raise their weapons, take game and open fire on the truck. By this time, the truck was halfway through the barriers and gaining speed the whole time. Hear the recording shows a number of Iraqi policemen, some of whom had fired their [inaudible] now scattering like the normal and rational men. They were some running right past the marines. The two marines had about three seconds left to live for about two seconds more. The recording shows the marines weapons firing nonstop. The truck's windshield exploded into shards of glass as their rounds took it apart and undoubtedly tore into the body of this terrorists that was trying to kill their brothers.

Speaker 2:          00:11:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:01       On aware of the danger at the time the other marine, since Iraqi soldiers in the barracks could take comfort in the fact that two marines were on watch and would die before they ran. The recording shows the truck careening to a stop immediately in front of the two marines in all of this instantaneous violence. Yale and herder never hesitated.

Speaker 2:          00:11:33       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:34       They never stepped back. They never even started to step back. They never even shifted their weight.

Speaker 2:          00:11:43       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:44       With their feet spread shoulder width apart. They leaned into the danger firing as fast as they could. They only had one second left to live. Then the truck explodes, the camera goes blank. And the two young men go to their God, six seconds, not enough time to think about their families, their country, their flag born about their lives or their deaths, but more than enough time for two very brave young men to do their duty into eternity. That is the kind of people who are on watch all over the world tonight for you.

Speaker 2:          00:13:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:19       And that was a speech that was given by Marine Corps general, General Kelly, and he gave the speech to gold star families. These are families who have lost a service member killed in action, and he gave that speech on February 21st, 2014

Speaker 2:          00:13:51       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:53       And General Kelly was obviously a speaking from the heart. Not only was he the commanding general in charge of those marines, but he also understands loss on a very personal level because on November 9th, 2010 general Kelly's oldest son, First Lieutenant Robert Michael Kelly was killed in action by a landmine while he was on patrol leading a platoon of marines in Afghanistan. And that story of those two marines is yet a nother example of the dedication and the devotion of the marines. And we know full well that there is example after example after example from all our branches of service. Examples of sacrifice and do, you can think about those six seconds, six seconds. We throw those away all the time. We can waste hours and days. We can even waste weeks as if we have an endless supply.

Speaker 2:          00:16:08       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:16:10       but we don't. If you were given six seconds to live, what would fill your mind? Would you be okay with that? Would you nod your head and think, okay, it's time. Would you be filled with regret in those last moments? Would you think about what you should done it, which you should have said who you should have been, and in the end would you realize that there's no reason ever to waste six seconds of your life? That is one lesson we can take away from General Kelly's speech.

Speaker 2:          00:17:46       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:47       Six seconds can be an Aternity. Another lesson we can take away from this speech and from its author knowing that General Kelly had lost his son, is that we have to move forward. We have to move on. And this isn't to say don't feel anything cause that's wrong. And that is not what we are doing. I mean, who can fathom the pain that General Kelly felt at the loss of his eldest son as his eldest son pursued a career that was no doubt inspired by the general himself, but he moved on. He drove on. I was talking to a friend of mine can, we were talking about survivor's guilt, which is something that we all feel on some level when we're in the military. And sometimes I think people feel as if there's something wrong with them.

Speaker 2:          00:19:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:23       Or they feel like they're weak because they let their emotions get ahold of them sometimes. And I could see my friend stealing that and I told him about an interview that I did.

Speaker 2:          00:19:39       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:39       With Colonel Tom Fife on this podcast, the, he was an army officer that had served in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. He had gotten a purple heart in all three wars.

Speaker 2:          00:19:52       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:53       And I explained to my friend that as Colonel Fife and I were discussing the men that he lost in Vietnam.

Speaker 2:          00:20:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:05       Colonel Phife got choked up. Colonel Phife got choked up.

Speaker 2:          00:20:11       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:12       Despite the fact that 51 years had passed since he lost those men.

Speaker 2:          00:20:21       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:23       51 years.

Speaker 2:          00:20:26       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:26       But he's still got emotional. Why is that? It's because we care about our men because we care about each other. And it's because while we hear that time heals all wounds, time does not remove the scars. They are going to be there and they're going to hurt. And that's okay. And that's normal. It's normal to feel the pain and it's normal to feel the guilt. And I think that's one of the hardest things for vets that I talked to is that they don't think that this is normal, but I am telling you it is normal. Every vet that I've talked to,

Speaker 2:          00:21:23       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:23       From World War Two Vietnam, the guys that have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, everyone feels it. It's part of the deal. It's part of the job.

Speaker 2:          00:21:39       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:40       It's part of the aftermath of war. It's always existed and if you're feeling that, then you should know that you are not alone. What else did we learn from this speech? Well, another thing opens up a whole, Oh, a whole box. A whole Pandora's box of lessons learned. We're talking about urban combat and how fast things can unfold. Their urban combat is exceptionally stressful. The, the space time continuum in urban combat is very compressed. The threats are 360 degrees. The enemy can be, they can be 500 meters away, but they can also be five meters away in one of the ways that we can mitigate that stress and thereby mitigate casualties and thereby mitigate the guilt that we all carry.

Speaker 2:          00:23:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:02       Is by knowing and understanding that form of combat to the best of our ability. And as always, history has much to teach us and I want to go now to a direct source. The leadership from Charlie one five Charlie Company, First Battalion Fifth Marines, Charlie one five fought in the battle of waste city, a brutal battle that took place during the Tet offensive Vietnam 1968 the battle lasted from January 30th to March 4th and included 11 Arvin battalions for US Army Battalions, three U S Marine Corps battalions support from the air force and they were fighting against a strength of about 10 enemy battalions. It was a massive battle and way was a built up city. It had a population of almost 150,000 people. It had typical urban terrain and also some unique terrain like the citadel, which was a massive walled portion of the city. By the time it was over, the enemy had lost thousands of men killed. The South Vietnamese had lost 452 men in America suffered 216 men killed in action and 1,584 wounded in action and here are some quotes from the interview from the digital journalists with a guy by the name of John Olsen and army combat photographer who is in way during this battle. He said, I was in a way for five days. I had been in Vietnam for one year at this time. I'd seen a lot of battles and I thought I was pretty experienced, but I'd never seen anything like way.

Speaker 2:          00:25:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:17       There was tremendous bravery, a lot of dead. There was a situation in way where we had marines in a courtyard. They had been moving from house to house and transitioning here across this courtyard, they had rocketed. A lot of them were wounded. There was no radio contact. We were pinned down and in pretty bad shape. We had an element that eventually came to into leave us and he'd had a priest and he gave last rites to the dead and he was a very generous priest. He offered to give the last rights to any of us that wanted them dead, wounded or not scratched at that point in context, it was such a horrific battle with such horrific images. Way was different. There were tremendous casualties and no way to treat them, no way to get them taken out. There were reports and as shown in this image, there was a marine who was badly wounded so badly he couldn't be treated than he was zipped up in a body bag while he was still alive. That's what way was like,

Speaker 2:          00:26:37       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:26:37       I was in way for five days and we were under heavy fire all the time. One of my favorite quotes was a journalist to asking a marine how many times he had been wounded in way and he said, today, sir.

Speaker 2:          00:26:57       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:26:59       so it was a brutal battle and there was

Speaker 2:          00:27:05       just

Speaker 1:          00:27:06       incredible heroism and sacrificed and of course there were many lessons learned and while the lessons focus on urban combat and they focus on the battle wastes city, I think as you hear some of these lessons learned, you'll see they apply broadly to leadership as a whole. And as we know, if we understand the way we can see it in all things. So let's go to this document. Lessons learned, Charlie, one five operation away city 31 January, 1968 to five March, 1968

Speaker 2:          00:27:48       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:49       Even under the best of circumstances, street fighting is a bloody business. This was in the end, the ultimate lesson learned by the United States Marine Corps personnel who participated in this historical battle considered by many to be the bloodiest of the Vietnam war. The Marine forces involved in operation way city lost 142 marines killed in action during the month long battle, including the initial fierce clashes involving primarily fighting throughout the southern sections of the city. In the climactic full scale battles inside the citadel, fortress itself, hundreds more marines were wounded and had to be medivaced on both sides of the river. Enemy casualties estimates range well into the thousands. Although operation waste city will long be remembered as an overwhelming victory over the best conventional forces the enemy could throw at us. And although the fifth marines overcame very unfavorable odds and ultimately triumph in the finest traditions of Marines in combat, in truth, this battle was a very close thing.

Speaker 2:          00:28:58       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:28:59       At the squad platoon and company levels, casualty rates were very severe, as high as 75% or more in some units,

Speaker 2:          00:29:09       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:29:10       This was especially true during the first day of day or two of each unit's initial experience in full scale urban combat. There's an important piece right there, specially heavy casualties during the first day or two of a unit going into combat. What does that mean? That means then that first day and two day or two, you are learning a ton. And that also means that if you can find out and figure out how to simulate that combat before you enter into those situations, you'll be able to overcome or at least mitigate some of those initial shock, uh, things that happen that shock your system and you're not ready for them. And you know, I talk about this with, with doing Jujitsu, for instance, for females, right? If you're a female that wants to learn self defense and you, you know, you started training Jujitsu. If you don't train Jujitsu and some guy grabs a hold of you, you're a, you're in shock.

Speaker 1:          00:30:17       You're not used to it, you haven't, you, you have to contend with that. Something that you're unaccustomed to. If you train Jujitsu, guess what? You have guys grabbing you every single day. They're grabbing you, they're grinding on you, they're trying to move you. You're used to that. You don't have to overcome that. Same thing with combat. The closer you can get to simulating what you're going to face in combat, the better you're going to do in combat. And you don't have to learn these horrible lessens your first entry. And you know, you and I have talked about this too. If you get, if, if let's say I learned a new move in Jujitsu and I did it to you, you'd, I'd catch you and then I show it to you and now all of a sudden I can't barely catch you anymore. Right? That's all it took.

Speaker 1:          00:31:02       All it takes is you knowing and understanding. And it's the same thing when we talk with businesses and we do, we do roleplaying exercises as a leader. And how do you talk? How do you tell someone that they need to improve their performance? You do a couple of role plays and you get good at their objections that they're going to give you are the reactions that they're going to have. You can get better if you wait until the real thing. You're not doing yourself any favors. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of like an ambush, right? Like an ambush is so effective, but if you know that push is coming, it's not even effective at all. Yeah. And once you've been ambushed, like imagine, I mean it, it happens all the time. Any, anytime you exp, you know and understand what's going to happen, you're infinitely more equipped to handle that thing.

Speaker 1:          00:31:47       Yeah. As opposed to I have no idea what's happening and I'm going to go and figure it out on the floor. Yeah. So experience is the best, but guess what? Experience is expensive. It takes a lot of time. So what you have to do is you have to train. That's what you have to do. What if the only time you, what if you wanted to get good at street fighting and the only time that you got to practice was when he got in a street fight. Yeah. Even if you literally went out every day and got in the street fights, two things would happen. Number one, you'll get arrested, but number two, you get all the first street fight. You might pick the wrong person and die. Yes, that is true, right? Yeah. So what you want to do is you want to get into a training environment. Yes. And then you want to get yourself skilled. Yeah. Same thing with the military. Same thing with fighting. Same thing with shooting. Same thing with business. Anything that you're, it's another

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       thing I see like business people, there's business people that have been through, let's say they've been through an acquisition, an acquisition before. They know what to expect. They're anticipating what's going on and it makes them that better at foreseeing what's gonna happen in mitigating the risk to it. Yeah. How do you, if you can't go through the acquisition, well what do you do? Read about him, you know, interview people, learn about, figure out what to expect, but hire someone on your team that has been through an acquisition before so you get, can capitalize on their experience. Yeah, it's crazy. I guess when you think about it. Not Crazy, but it's interesting. So you know like sports teams for example, like a, um, well, uh, I guess football, say football for an example. You practice for like five or six days, just practice, practice, practice and two, sometimes more hours every single day, you know, maybe a day off maybe.

Speaker 3:          00:33:33       And then, yeah, for one game. So it's like there's training, then there's performance kind of thing and they go kind of hand in hand. Like you got to perform in training and then you know, the game or whatever that you learned stuffed in. They get them too. But it's, it's interesting where one game is predicated on so much training, so much training, but then when you go to work, it's like you, you kind of expect to have gone or they expect you or whatever the expectation is that you went through your training or Eddie, and then they'll add sprinkles of training. Like a work. Just normal when you go to work. Yeah. So every once in a while you'll have what gear. Quite honestly, that's, that's one of the reasons I salon Ashlyn font is doing well because people are realizing that if you want your leaders to know how to lead, you actually have to train them out of lead and that you can actually do that.

Speaker 3:          00:34:24       Yeah. So that's one of the reasons that it's you Ashkelon front is in such high demand because we can actually train your leaders to handle these situations that they're coming up against. And when you do that, you have this massive advantage. And we see the companies that we work with, they, they, their, their performance just improves immensely because their leaders are working together and learning how to lead. And the most powerful thing you can have. Yeah, it's, it's weird cause I, you know, I'm kind of behind the scenes guy with echelon front and I see like, you know, any video that it's been done, I probably seen it, you know, and I'm around, you know, all the time. So essentially I'm getting the course too, you know? And it's interesting where I think probably in a lot of cases I probably am more trained in it than most people. Even most people, companies that you work with or whatever because I'm kind of getting it secondhand and listening because it applies to everyday life, you know, like this whole deal. It's not just work isn't in fact for me, I mean yeah it applies to my quote unquote work. But it applies to like family stuff, you know, life stuff. And the big thing, this is the big thing. This is a big difference. You

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       know the material, you but you because your position, you'd use it on your family but you don't use it in a work environment. And therefore you get to learn the technique but you don't get to roll. You don't get to spar. Not In hard. And here's the thing, when we work with companies, it's not like, oh, here's this information, and then they go apply it perfectly. No, they come back and say, hey, this didn't work. I went and talked to guy and he said this, it's like, okay, cool. Here's how you've got to overcome that. So there's the, you got to get the initial information. Yes, but you still have to apply it. Even if you train a group for combat as much as you possibly can, they're still going to have a certain delta that they're going to need to rise to when the real free occurs.

Speaker 1:          00:36:23       And so we see that with companies. We see that with individual leaders that are part of companies where they're there and I show up sometimes, you know, there's some people out there that are just straight up in the game and they're in the game before I even show up. Like it's the icing on the cake. And even people that have read extreme ownership 10 times, they've read dichotomy of leadership 12 times. They've listened to every single podcast and they'll still ask questions about things because they haven't quite put it together, split like they haven't mapped it perfectly on their situation. Right. And just like I said, like it takes, it takes like, okay, how you say, I don't really get to spar. I D I do get to spar, but they're real easy, super easy sparring partners. What do I got? I got you. I got my wife, you know, I'm like, you know, this is coming easy. Splunk partner technically. Yeah, for the, for this stuff it is. I mean technically you're the easiest sparring partner because you're just like, you're doing the same thing, you know? So it's like there's no friction. I mean, very little friction maybe on some level, but I miss songs.

Speaker 1:          00:37:29       But the, the, you know, these people at work when they apply it, well you know, when you have, whether it be a corporate job or what or whatever, anytime where you have bigger teams, different personalities, you know, you care about people in different levels. It's like it takes way more, it takes more effort and more time on the mat for people to get proficient to where you look at a situation, you go, oh, here's what this, here's the problem, going to hear this guys. He goes, get a little out of control a minute, massages, ego a little bit, and we'll let them have some more control and that'll make him feel better and they'll do a better job like it. It takes a little bit of experience to get to that point. And, and you know, a lot of times, like I said, when we go and work with a company that this fully in the game and they'll be batting, there'll be nailing nine out of 10 things and then there'll be one more thing that they need a little adjustment on.

Speaker 1:          00:38:15       And they make that adjustment and they call. Yeah. You know, and everything makes sense. So training is how you get good. Don't waste your time getting beat up in street fights in order to learn. It doesn't make sense. All right. Moving on. The ultimate success of this operation could have been significantly improved in our opinion by several factors, including one improved less restrictive rules of engagement, including situational flexibility down to the platoon level. This is something we hear about all the time. Here's the deal. What that, what that really means is decentralized command. You need to trust your troops. You need to explain to them what is important, what is not rules of engagement to tell someone you cannot do this. What I'm saying, if I say Echo, you cannot shoot at this type of building. If I tell you that what I'm telling you is I don't trust you to make a good decision based on the information I give you.

Speaker 1:          00:39:21       If I was to say, Hey, listen, some of these buildings that are marked with a star, those buildings are historical buildings that will cause the civilian populace to um, you know, get angry at us. So don't shoot at them. If I say that to you and I say, tell me, explain to you why it's important, and then I say, hey, look, then again, remember you're in the field. You need to protect your men and you say God and now you go on the field and if you're a good leader and you trust me and I trust you and I've explained the commander's intent well and you understand the strategic impact of, of disobeying or of, of going outside the rules of him that that, or not the rules, but the direction that I've given you, then you understand that that's great and you'll make a good decision because what that decision might entail is you're getting shot at from one of these buildings and now you have to take it down.

Speaker 1:          00:40:12       If I don't trust you to make that decision, what do I do? I put strict rules of engagement on you and now you can't do something and that is, that is not decentralized command and it's not generally good. Do you have to put some broad rules in place? Yes, you absolutely do, but you have to make sure that the people on the ground understand that those rules can be bent if they have to, when they have to have the authority and the leeway to do that next to improved communication. Of intelligence information to all levels of command. Of course, communicate. Communication is one of those things. And again, I, I feel, I always feel when we go to work with a company, it's one of the first things I have to ask is what are your methodologies of communication through your company? How do you communicate with your frontline troops?

Speaker 1:          00:40:56       How do you communicate with your mid level managers? How do your mid level managers and your frontline troops communicate with you? Because sometimes the front line troops might see something out on the battlefield, but you don't see because you're up in the ivory tower. Yeah. And how do they communicate that back to you? Do you have a methodology? Oftentimes communication is ineffective or it's, they don't have procedures around it. They have protocol on how to communicate that's bad. So communication up and down the chain of command. Simple, clear and concise. And that's the way it's gotta be. Three acquisition of improved intelligent data in particular concerning the disposition and size of enemy forces.

Speaker 1:          00:41:36       That's cool. That's a little bit of, uh, a universal fantasy for military people that we want great intelligence. We want to know who the enemy is. If we knew who the enemy has power jobs, so that's a, that's a universal fantasy and we should always strive to achieve that fantasy, but it's very difficult to get to. But then they go to this reconnaissance and small unit probes to fix enemy positions are critical. What? What that means is when you want intelligence, go get it. Go find it. Gather the Intel yourself as much as you can for improved supporting fire plan, access to artillery, naval gunfire, direct fire from armored vehicles and air support should be judiciously employed. Doh deployed. So what does that mean? We need to cover? We need cover from big guns covering move five significantly increased training for urban conflict, street fighting practice and preparation. I think we just covered that. Training is always paramount. Six deployment of available chemical weapons in this case, tear gas for offensive operations during early stages of the operation. These guys use tear gas and it worked well. The North Vietnamese army had didn't have gas masks and they didn't like it.

Speaker 1:          00:43:01       Of course, you know, there's people when you, when you say chemical weapons, what do we think of? We think a mustard gas. There's other, there's nerve agents and nerve gas. That's where people generally think of when you think of chemical weapons, but chemical weapons are also tear gas and tear gas can be very effective. There's also some people that can just BTF through threw tear gas. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:43:25       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:43:28       continuing seven, improved dissemination of operational plan details down to the fire team level.

Speaker 1:          00:43:41       Fire team leaders, these fire team leaders. If the fire team leaders, and you're talking about someone that's in charge of four guys or six guys or something like that. Really small little element. If those people understand what you're trying to accomplish as a team, that means they can execute at their level and make things happen. They can move the ball in the right direction. If they don't know where they're supposed to be going. They can't help you. Yeah, they can help you. So broad guidance needs to be given, needs to be updated. People need to understand, hey, we're trying to move forward trying to take this area. We're trying to move across this line. Everyone needs to understand that if they don't understand that they're there. Actually no good to you. If you've got a fire team leader out on the flank somewhere that has no idea that you're trying to move forward or move east or west or north, that person is just sitting there waiting for you to tell him what to do. They're almost worthless. So, and, and this also means if you're a fire team leader and you don't know if you're supposed to be going north, east, south, west, whatever, you should be raising your hand and saying, Hey, what are we doing? Tell me what we're doing.

Speaker 1:          00:44:53       Continuing on the other side of the scale, small unit experience, individual marine determination, the buddy system, the quick learning capacity of marines under combat conditions, the combined leadership officer's staff Nco as an NCO pose of one five at all levels. And the ultimate ability to coordinate fire support and execute street fighting tactics under heavy fire were factors that one, this pivotal battle despite incredible odds, high casualty rates and the resulting turnover of officers and NC.

Speaker 1:          00:45:26       So you, it comes down to your individual marines and your, your frontline leadership that make these things happen, which no doubt the military or the u s military is awesome in a, in their front line leadership and the frontline troops, they make so many things happen. The, even in many cases, despite poor leadership, you just, you just have great frontline leadership. I mean I would see that a lot. You know, you'd get a platoon that had kind of a marginal and if not maybe even a bad platoon commander, but you just get some guys in that platoon that are awesome. The platoon would be awesome as long as the leader was humble enough to take guidance. If the, if the leader wasn't humble enough to take guidance, they would fail because he would just drag everyone in his terrible ways down. If he, if he had the common sense to say, you know what, I'm going to listen to these guys. I'm going to let them kind of run with it. Platoon would do fine.

Speaker 1:          00:46:24       Continuing on, certainly using 20, 20 perspective of hindsight, this battle could have been decided and even more timely and decisive fashion, reducing friendly casualty rates in the process by paying attention to the fundamentals of Planning Marine Operations. Proper prior planning prevents Piss poor performance and they actually edited out pis because they're squared away. Marines. Yeah, got to come up with a good plan and had they done that better? This is the typical situation. Hindsight's always 2020 and I, I always avoid becoming a arm chair postgame critic in the military. I mean I'll criticize someone like a fighter in the UFC or whatever, but when it comes to military operations, uh, it's real easy to sit back and throw darts and say, well, you know, I would have done this. You weren't there. You didn't see it. I didn't see it. I wasn't in this situation. I have all the now they didn't have those facts. So I'm always very cautious about Huc and darts into the past

Speaker 5:          00:47:36       and you deal with like that can situation you. It's, and you kind of use it. You actually do you use this as, you know when you say you can sit back and be at a tactical genius or whatever? Yeah. I don't know. If I make a video you can like sit back and be like look at these like 10 mistakes or 10 things or whatever. Meanwhile there's like a thousand elements so 990 elements have had to be created well in in work and all this stuff and then you can just be like, yeah those, cause essentially those are created for you. You know, you don't have to create those things. All you have to do is poke holes in the 10 yeah and I can focus instead of having to focus on a thousand things, I can take a broader look and see the 10 things that you screwed up or one thing. None of nine Mikey slick. Probably this one

Speaker 1:          00:48:21       maybe too. All right. The following details regarding the lessons learned from operation wasted. You're offered from the former members of Charlie company, First Battalion Fifth Marine Regiment, First Marine Division who served in combat during operation way city and who were directly involved in the battle with Nva forces inside the citadel fortress from 13 February, February, 1968 through five March, 1968 situation terrain. There is an infinite variety of possible landscapes that may be confronted by a Marine force given the mission of attacking an enemy force in urban terrain,

Speaker 1:          00:48:57       infinite variety of possible landscapes. What does that remind me of? That reminds me of life itself. When the Tet offensive broke out on 31 January, 1968 and conventional NVA forces overran major sections of the largest cities in south Vietnam. Marine forces were literally knee deep and Rice patties in jungle mud. Since first establishing a beachhead in 1965 marines had been assigned the mission of conducting a counterinsurgency or rural conflict, fighting for the most part, a guerilla army. The Tet offensive changed all of that. And for the first time since the height of the Korean War in 1954 marines found themselves with a mission that involved urban combat.

Speaker 2:          00:49:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:46       So you have to be able to, you should never turn your back on something. I had a fighter, I was training for a fight and

Speaker 2:          00:49:57       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:57       I was like, Hey, let's do some groundwork. No, the with you on the bottom. And the dude was strong. He wasn't a, it wasn't a good wrestler. Well let me rephrase that. A decent wrestler, but not by any stretch, you know, not a call that, not a competitive call address or anything like that, but solid, strong, very strong. I said, hey man, let's put you on the bottom. And the response was, I'm not going to be on the bottom.

Speaker 2:          00:50:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:50:26       Gotcha.

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       Hey, well even if you don't think you're going to be on the bottom, let's train for the unlikely event that you happen to end up on the bottom because it's a fight and anything happened. I don't need to, I'm not going to be on the bottom. Yeah. So we can sell where the story's going. He went to his fight and fought and was on the bottom. Basically the whole fight, it was a three round fight, was on the bottom almost the whole time. So it was oral via and why? Because you can't, you can't neglect one. Part of the possibilities that can unfold. And even even for us, when we would get ready to deploy to Iraq, we're going to Iraq. We're literally going to a desert and going to be in the middle of the desert and we would still do dive operations. We'd still do maritime operations while we were getting ready to deploy.

Speaker 4:          00:51:16       Why? Because we don't know what's gonna Happen. We don't know whether it would next war is going to break out. So just don't neglect anything. And I'll tell you what else. If you're good at a variety of things, you will be better at everything. So if all we knew how to do is enter rooms, what happens when, when that, when we, when we enter a building and instead of being a bunch of rooms, it's a giant warehouse or no, it needs to be cleared. Like we've gotta think about these things. But the more flexible you are, the more capabilities you have that that's what I'm looking for. The more capabilities you have, the more flexibility you have. So learn different skill sets. Don't neglect things.

Speaker 1:          00:52:01       Continuing on preparing to remove an enemy battalion that is captured a 40 story skyscraper or a college campus as much different than, oh, he's a much different mission than getting the enemy squad out of a house, school or church in a small town. But common factor in all of these variations, however, is that in all cases in urban combat structures dominate the terrain. Studying and assessing terrain is a fundamental issue for marine commanders when planning mission, this, this idea of terrain is so important. The way, the advantage that terrain gives you is, I don't know what to compare it to in other, in anything else. If you understand terrain,

Speaker 4:          00:52:47       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:52:48       you can dominate. It's like trying to do Jujitsu and not understanding arm position like where that you need under hooks. If you know, if you're going against people don't understand on our hooks, you will destroy them. If you go in against someone that doesn't understand where to position their hands, where to position their arms, you will destroy them. If you're going to get someone that doesn't understand how to utilize the terrain, you will, you will destroy them. If you don't know how to utilize the terrain, you will get destroyed. And by the way, that doesn't matter if you're in the city, you're in, in rural environment as a matter where you are. Studying and terrain is a fundamental

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       issue for marine commanders when planning missions. This is even more critical and planning house to house combat operations, building materials very worldwide and their ability to provide small arms cover to a very high degree for the use of reconnaissance and intelligence. We recommend conducting a serious assessment of each building or structure that is within your units area of operations because tactics involved and taking each objective, building structure, et Cetera, maybe different. In each case, a small wood frame house may offer to the illusion of cover from small arms fire, but little else in some places, walls are paper thin. Even houses that use some form of plaster concrete construction can prove to be unexpectedly porous and at the worst possible times.

Speaker 1:          00:54:12       This is something to consider all the time. Things are not always what they see that that's, that's what's important there. Things are not always what they seem you, you think you're hiding behind a wall and now you're safe. No bullets will go right through it.

Speaker 2:          00:54:27       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:30       Continuing. No. The basic layout of a structure as much as possible before entry. This is something that I would say our standard operating procedures in the u s military now are so good that we don't really need to know that did the layout of a structure. Hmm, we're gonna go in and be able to handle whatever the structure, however the structure is laid out. That's what we do. If you don't train to enter rooms regularly and you don't train to enter buildings and you don't train to be able to contend with all these varieties of things that you could face, you won't be able to, if you try and say, okay, we need to know what the building looks like inside before we go in there. That's a horrible, horrible idea. It's not going to happen. And by the way, when you go in there, the first thing you're going to come across as a barricade where you can't go down the hallway and you got to go through these other rooms that you weren't expecting.

Speaker 2:          00:55:20       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:55:23       Continuing approach, each structure with an entry plan and a surge plan and make sure each member of the fire team in squad as well versed in these plans. What I say instead of that, it's not plans. These are standard operating procedures. So you develop standard operating procedures so you know what to do when you enter a building. And so does everyone on the team established voice codes and commands and communicate regularly with each other? Yes. Consider entryways existing doors and windows to be extremely dangerous, likely locations for Woobie traps and to be avoided if at all possible, wherever possible, blow entry holes using Satchel charges are rockets. Once the entry plan is finalized and understood, it must be executed with fierce determination. Be prepared for anything and be ready to improvise. Be Systematic and check everything. Basement, sewer access addicts, rooftops, trash cans thoroughly before establishing that the objective is secure.

Speaker 1:          00:56:17       So what I, one of the most important things I take away from that is that the, the existing entryways, you got to consider them dangerous. W W how do we translate that into life? What that means is these well established patterns are exactly that. And it, I'm not saying you can't ever use a pattern that someone else used, but you at least at a minimum, have to be aware of the fact that when you're doing something, when you're using a path that someone else has already gone down, it's a known path. And so you can't expect to be able to surprise your competitor when you're doing something that's always been done the same way. Gotcha. Yeah. So think of how you can approach things in a different manner and if in fact that manner might be better. Sometimes you look at things from a different angle and you, you realize that the reason that everyone does it this way is because that's the best possible way and to make some huge, Herculean effort to try and do something like, to just to be different. Sometimes that's the wrong answer. I get that. But considerate. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:57:24       Yeah. Lot of times those, and like certain industries are like this up in an email, but they're, they're so used to doing it a certain way because that's sort of like what they learned then. It's all for sure. It's almost like as an industry, they don't think of like what, why they're doing it that way.

Speaker 1:          00:57:41       Well, yeah, that's why, that's why there's been so many disruptors right in the last few years. I mean, you can look at any of these disruptors, uh, companies that are come out of nowhere that, you know, you can look at the ride sharing applications. If you were a taxi driver, you were thinking, okay, how can we get more dispatchers? How can I hire more cars? These, you know, these ride sharing people said, oh, we're not going to own any cars. Yeah, that's great. Same with Airbnb, right? We're not going to build a hotel. We're going to use a random people's houses and puts you in there. That's looking at it from a completely different angle. Yeah. Seeing a problem and coming up with a completely different solution. If you looked at a city and said, oh wow, there's no rooms in that city. There's no hotel rooms in that city. Where am I going to put in? Everyone? Okay, well let's do what everyone else does. We'll build a building and we'll put rooms in there and we'll staff the building and we'll put a restaurant. That's what you do. That's what's been done. Guess what? Someone else looked at that and said, you know, there's nowhere to stay in that city, but some people might have empty rooms in their house. Let's, let's see if we can access those rooms. Boom. There you go.

Speaker 5:          00:58:55       Yeah. I wonder how it was where the guy, one of the guys was like, hey shoot, I can't find a hotel room when I go to San Francisco. And then the friend was like, Hey, just come stay with me. Yup. And then when he stayed with them, he was like, you know, next time you come, if you, if he can't find a hotel room, you can always stay with me when I call. Yeah. Hey, I'm not the only way I'm coming up here. I'm coming up on and

Speaker 1:          00:59:14       you know, um, my company's paying me to come up here so I can get them, you know, they'll give me money for the room, so maybe I could just pay you and

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       you go, oh cool. We're kind of, we're kind of getting a little, it helps us kick it back to the company. Cool. And then the next thing you know, hey, I bet other cities have, I know a guy down the road, he has a room, it doesn't really use. So if you have any coworkers and Ellen, if you know anybody, you know that guy too. Simple as that. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:59:40       Simple as that. But it's looking at it from a different angle.

Speaker 2:          00:59:46       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:59:46       So look at things from a different angle then what you come up, you know, fierce determination first determination is always good. Yeah, that makes sense. Is there a dichotomy to fierce determination? Yes. The redness. Can you have someone that's too fiercely determined? Fiercely determined, yes you can. Yes, you can. They don't know when to stop. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:00:10       Next. The other aspect of urban terrain or the spaces between buildings, streets, alleys and other pathways are normal routes for humans and therefore must be sussed. Must be, must be suspected to be under observation and possible enemy firing lanes whenever possible. Take the most difficult route from house to house. Hmm. Same thing we just talked about. Look for a different path. Establish and the, and there's obviously there's a dichotomy to that because if you're constantly just taking the hard road all the time, you might not make any progress, which is also bad. Established an advance, a plan of what to do in the event noncombatants are found in urban zones and for marking buildings that had been cleared. It's kind of crazy that they knew would have an idea of how they're going to mark buildings that were cleared. Continuing. Make absolutely sure that your marines are aware that while inside a building being secured, they are at risk from both within and without. Always assume that every room of every floor in each and every house contains enemy. Soldiers always move very quickly when moving in front of windows or doors. Always nowhere. Enemy positions may be in buildings that are adjacent to yours as an all marine operations. Watching your buddies back, watch your buddies back and run as fast as possible when traversing open ground. Can't let your guard down. Can't let your guard down.

Speaker 5:          01:01:43       Where do you let your guard down? Me? Yeah. We can't tell you it's, it's probably a pretty broad area. 100% of my life probably. Yeah. Is there any time where you feel like, Hey, I need to get my guard up. This is probably an easier question for you. Yeah. You're not just running around hyper paranoid check. I am. Yeah. Yeah. Know what in life you mean? Or in Jujitsu? What like everything? Yeah. Like I would say, I dunno it put it this way, my guards always up, but it's only kind of up, I think you know it's like a 25% and

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       it kind of fluctuates from moment to home and they fluctuate. It's up from like zero to three stays at 25 sometimes it goes up to like 30 sometimes certain scenarios here check multiple stories. Structures present an even greater challenge than single story buildings in medium size village or town or small city that is dominated by one, two and three story buildings be very particular about the taller buildings which are naturally used by the enemy as high ground if possible, make entry to taller multilevel buildings via the roof and work systematically and thoroughly downward. Always look for the high ground. So does that sort of the thing, you know, cause the high ground kind of seems simple straight forward or whatever, but is there like a, a blueprint, like a simple blueprint for like, I remember you told me a story where your son was talking with like a neighbor or something who had, I don't know if he went to Vietnam or something.

Speaker 1:          01:03:18       Like he was in, he was in the military, whatever. And you get, and they played like laser tag or something. His son like whooped him because he knew the like some something. Well yeah, my son knew some fundamental tactics. It was when he was younger, so he wasn't really up to speed yet. He was like seven or six. But you know, not up to us. We started, you know, he was, he was already through I think, I think it was through level seven of my tactical course. Um, yeah, he's probably around level seven. What tactical chorus. I have like some tactical lessons sat I run, you know, what do you mean that you run like as a father or as a what? Like echelon front has a tactical course. They move? No, I had a tactical concepts that I teach and you teach because you didn't teach me nothing.

Speaker 1:          01:04:04       Right. 25% cruising mode. Yeah. Cause you know that's just the standard right now. If you know there's certain things you have to learn in order to be tacked to be proficient. And I, my son had learned, like I had gone through seven of the courses to understand the tactical things and there was a friend of my wife's friend came over. He yes, he was a prior marine or actually he was active duty marine and yes, my son challenged him to a laser tag tag competition. And yes, my son was victorious three times in a row. And in the room he just did simple fundamental tactics. And it wasn't even team sport. It was a one on one. Yeah. So how do you defeat someone one on one? Well you maneuver very quickly. You don't fire from the besaint same position multiple times. You get the high ground because you'd like, he knew if you get onto my garage roof, which had access with a ladder, you're going to be able to defend that position very thoroughly and the person that's below you because all you have to do when you're on the garage roof is doc and your hidden, it's a parapet roof, eh.

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       Sorry. Are you have to use a deck up there? Yeah, there's one access point. How are you going to beat me? You don't have grenades with the late, you'll have laser grenades and then he's drive the high ground. Yeah. I'm seven years old or six years old. I have the high ground, I have a laser weapon. You're trying to attack me. You're going to die. Yeah. And then the next round when you're trying to get up on that thing, I'm not there anymore. I'm in the alleyway up the alleyway up behind the fence. Higher. Still higher still. So the high ground is kind of like the Golden Golden Room. Hmm. Yeah. Interesting. You know, when the first time I found out that the high ground is the, is the spot to be where when I watched the movie called the Rock, they're washed out in the Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage where the navy seals come up.

Speaker 3:          01:06:03       You know, they got to go to Alcatraz, they come up through the, wherever the journey or something like this. Yeah. And they get, you know, boom. They're sort of surprised by the, the, I think they're marines. Yeah. The terror. They're mercenaries at this point. But nonetheless, or patriots depends exactly what, uh, yeah. And he was like, Hey, your guys just surrounded, uh, from an elevated position. It's kind of like, this is a no brainer, you know, this kind of thing. I guess that's a thing. Yeah. And it is a thing, you know, and they, and they killed them all. Yeah. Except for Nicholas Cage. He didn't die. Hmm. That's, that's chemical agent, by the way. Right. Vx Gas. That's what I was going to say. Yeah. But you, you'd know that was a real, or are you good? Let's be since fries. He didn't just dive deep right into that. I was gonna, but you know those little pearl, the little pearl balls are kind of interesting. Back to the book,

Speaker 1:          01:07:03       the mission assigned to Marine forces during operation wasted, he was to remove enemy forces that had captured major sections of the ancient imperial capital of way during the surprise, Nva offensive that was quickly dubbed the Tet offensive due to the historic listen closely due to the historic aspect of many of the buildings in way the usage of heavy weapons was significantly restricted during the initial days of fighting on both sides of the river as friendly casualties mounted and as initial estimates of the size of the enemy force. In a way, city area was significantly increased. Fire restrictions were ultimately lifted, so they didn't want to damage these historical buildings, and so they said, hey, don't don't use 50 cal, don't use whatever, whatever weapons they said they couldn't use,

Speaker 3:          01:07:54       and then eventually when the casualties got so bad, they said, okay, go ahead and do what you gotta do. I say, rip the bandaid off, right? If you're going to go, you go. If you're going to go, go, don't play around, that's a good lesson. America learns over and over and over again. If you're going to go to war,

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       go to when you're number one priority over everything else. That should be to win, and by the way, if they would have done that, I guarantee the city would have been in better shape at the end because the enemy's going to drag this thing out and it's going to take longer. You're going to have to end up destroying every single building that's there. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:08:32       makes sense.

Speaker 1:          01:08:34       They continue. In our respectful opinion, our ability to successfully complete the mission was initially severely impacted by the rules of engagement. Again, this is a lack of trust up and down the chain of command. If I have to impose strict rules of engagement on my people, I haven't trained them well enough. I don't trust them. They don't trust me. They don't understand the strategic mission and we have a real problem.

Speaker 4:          01:08:59       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:09:02       Continuing. Although it is understood that mission and rules of engagement are not the exclusive responsibility of marine leadership at the platoon company, battalion or even regimental level. It is strongly recommended that every effort is made at every level in the chain of command to ensure that balance has been achieved between the demands of the mission and the effect of the rules of engagement on the ability of the command to perform the mission successfully. Yes, you do have to have balance, but what you really should have is trust and understanding of the situation so that people don't need to be constrained by rules. If I have, if I, if my leaders understand what I want them to do and they understand the constraints and they understand the mission and they understand the impact, they don't need any rules at all.

Speaker 5:          01:09:58       They just need to get told to go. Yeah. I think about like certain laws where if this is going to be the law of the land, that this law applies to everybody. Same thing with rules of engagement where they got it, cause they kinda got to apply to everyone. Right. In a certain way. So that's why they wind up being so strict or they can, um, and I'm thinking about laws to where there's certain groups or individuals that it's like, man, that La kind of shitting and apply it to me because I know better. You know like where like you don't like the guy who's like, okay unquiet as this red light, right, this, this or this stoplight where the crossroad of that stop light is a dirt road. And on both, if you turn in the dirt road, either direction, there's a gate that's always closed.

Speaker 5:          01:10:44       It's only Click, oh, it's for like Cain trucks and stuff. Or it was, I don't know what it is now, but, and the cane truck guys have the key to the gate. This big long get, you can't even turn in there, but there's still a stoplight, right? So it's never read because it only turns green when the kitten, but every once in a while it'd be red and the gate will be closed, you know, and all that sort of happens. And here's the thing, you can see the gates quote, no truck is coming. Even if a truck was coming, like they got to stop that open, they get whatever. Should you stay at that red stoplight or can you just blow through the light? You would think any responsible adult should have the authority or whatever to see that and just go through the light.

Speaker 5:          01:11:26       But the rules got applied to everybody. That's the thing. It has to apply to everyone. And what about the new driver who's like, they can discern quite as well where a safe red light running situation versus a not so safe red light running situation. And then there's a spectrum, you know, so when these rules get put in place, they got to apply to everybody at the lowest common denominator person. And unfortunately these highest co hired denominational people got apply to them too because you know, you can't just go down the line and be like, okay this rule applies to you, but kind of kind of, you know, just maybe 30% this rule applies to him hundred percent of course, and him to you 1% cause you're this elite dude so you can, you know, you have ultimate flicks, you know, it's hard to do that, especially when you do it like a bunch of people. So that's why that can be a pain in the ass sometimes. You see what I'm saying?

Speaker 1:          01:12:19       Three apparently that's been bothering you for quite some time. How long have you lived in America for mainland?

Speaker 5:          01:12:25       Like think about like the court system or like, you know, yeah, no rules get put in place for sure because people don't trust

Speaker 1:          01:12:36       the subordinates that have to follow the rule. Right? You tell your kid you're not allowed to go in the yard because the pools out there, right. What you're really saying is, I don't trust that you're not going to go in the pool or I don't trust that you're that you can swim well enough. If you're a good leader, you'll be like, okay, we got it. We need to work on this. You can do understand the dangers and that's a little bit of a weird thing to talk about because drum and a pool for a little kid, you obviously have to err towards the side of safety. That's probably not the best example, but if you tell your kid no one's allowed to come to, okay, I'm going on a trip Friday night, no one come over to the house. Those are the rules. You know? If my kids actually understood what I really meant is like, hey, if you want to have a couple kids over, that's cool. Don't get crazy. Don't eat my food. Weird to stay away from the milk. No Weirdos, no. You know, if they understood all that, which actually that's what my kids were like, Hey, I've got a couple kids coming over. It's all good. You know? If they broke the trust, then things might be different than I have to go and implement rules.

Speaker 5:          01:13:32       Yeah. But on top of that year, you're talking about like your kids or like, you know, in the military if you're dealing with like one unit or one little group of people, but if the rules of engagement or in your case like the rule of people coming over, what if, what if it didn't just apply to your kids? What if it applied to the whole block or the whole town or whatever. So it's like, just to keep everyone safe. We've got to sell. This is the standard, which is why we don't want communism. Yes, yes. They just make tunnels that are and blanket over every, well, that's how laws are even here. Sure. The gun laws consider the gun lots for sure. Like, Hey, we need background check, but the gold rules got apply to everyone. You know, you can't discriminate kind of thing. They

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       have to apply to everybody. So it's like, man, well yeah, that's, the gun rules are a perfect example because they don't trust the people. Everyone. Yeah. Certain people you know. Oh, everyone just can't have a gun. You have to get her background check. Okay, fair enough. Why? But then it goes, then it continues. See that's, that's where, that's where you run into products where there's so much debate about gun laws because pretty much everyone says, hey, I get it. You should probably get some kind of a background check before you get a firearm. Everyone goes, hm, okay. I don't want somebody that's been, I don't want somebody that's a felon or a violent criminal to be able to get a gun. Cool. I agree with that. The problem is where does it stop? Yeah. And, and then the problem on top of that is because of the, where does it stop?

Speaker 1:          01:14:57       Because of the slippery slope thing. The people that don't want any gun laws, they just said, we don't want any, like every single, you know, while we think we should, that the background checks should be an extra three days, no work. And meanwhile, on the other side, people are saying every single thing that they can do to restrict firearms from being had by anybody. They try and move it there. So both sides or just take an extreme position and no one will actually have a normal logical conversation about what's going on. It's just, and even when you do minute yelling and screaming from the polar polarized positions. Yeah, and I, and a lot of times, even if you're in that in the moment, like you can step back and see that when that happens, when people are just like, hey, you're just defending your position just to just kind of blindly or whatever, you can see that happen.

Speaker 1:          01:15:50       I'm not saying like it's so terrible. I don't think it's natural. I get it. But even if you can have like an un Un civilized discussion, it's still hard because it's based on people. Yeah. Because it could be good because like for me, I should absolutely be ha be able to have whatever guns I want. Yeah. Right. That's, that's the way I feel. I feel that I should be able to, and I sh yes, you can check my background. You can see if I am a felon or a violent criminal. You can see that I'm not okay. You should be able to, I should be able to get whatever guns I want and, but there's some people that think, hey, you know, but as strongly as I feel about that, as strong as I feel like I should be able to what? Get whatever guns I want.

Speaker 1:          01:16:36       If someone says, oh well then you agree that everyone should be able to get every gun they want to know. Actually I don't agree with that. I think that there's some people that don't need guns. I can say that. I can say that without, without thinking, without saying, oh well Jocko believes in gun control for everyone. It's like, no, I just said what I believed. So the rules are about trust and you have to figure out where the trust lies with everyone, by the way. And you have to figure out what the minimum amount of trust is that you can overlay on people everywhere. That's where, that's why governing of giant country so hard. Yeah. And depending on where you live too, because depending on where you live, you have different needs. You have different, like there's some people that live, the culture is different, but depending on where you live, like if you live in a state where there's predatory animals and you live out in the bush somewhere, you're damn right.

Speaker 1:          01:17:35       You need guns. If you live in a state where there's predatory animals that are human beings that will break in your house and kill you, I guess what you also need to be able to protect your family. Yeah, that's good to go. You know, uh, somebody asked me the other day is like, is, is uh, it's actually Tim, it was actually Tim Ferriss. He was asking me if pepper spray is good home defense. I'm like, pepper sprays, good home defense against a person that isn't carrying a weapon. I said, but if someone's breaking into your house or coming to attack you, are they not going to have a weapon? Do, are they following some kind of a rules of engagement? Were there I am. Hey, I'm going on a basic B and e tonight. I'm only going to bring, um, you know, I'm only gonna bring my, my, my pillow to hit people with like, no, they're breaking in your house to kill you or they're breaking in your house too to assault your family or whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:18:29       The breaking into your house too. They shouldn't be breaking into your house and they're probably going to be able to defend themselves because they don't want to get caught. So what do they do to defend themselves? They got a knife and they got out whatever they gotta go nine. So pepper spray. Great. The problem with pepper sprays, you, you don't, you don't, they're not following the rules of engagement. The rules of engagement. Yeah. That's a good question too. But like pepper spray, why would you use like think of a real scenario where you would use pepper spray as a, as a human girl? I get it. Cause you have valuable goods regardless of where you go. Yeah. You can be at the post stuff. He's still got those valuable goods that predators might want as a girl. But let's say, okay, I'm Tim Ferriss or I'm, you know, me or whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:19:09       Why when would I use the prepper pepper spray? Realistic that I'm sure there's only one 10 was just asking that because it's a legitimate question because if someone says, look, I'm not really comfortable with guns, but if someone wants comes into my house, I want to build to defend myself, I'm going to get pepper spray. And the the, the real quick answers like, yeah, okay, cool. Yep. Better than it makes you go, oh that kind of makes sense. Right. At least you got something. The reality is the person's coming in your house, it's pepper spray is great. As long as they don't have a knife, as long as they don't have a gun, in which case the pepper spray is doing you no good cause you pepper spray me and I have a knife. I'm going to grab a hold of you. I'm going to, I'm going to cut your head off.

Speaker 1:          01:19:50       That's what's going to happen in a situation that you, you got to use the pepper spray. So like if someone's like burglarizing you and you turn it on the light and they scatter, you don't need the pepper spray for that kind of situation. You know pepper spray is for someone who like, well yeah, but you don't know that they're going to scatter. But yeah, just like you don't know if they have a gun or not. Yes. Yeah, yeah. And if you're prowling around in someone's house, you're going to be in a serious situation. Yeah. I think he should be. Yeah. Are you're going to be in a real bad situation. Yeah. So that's what rules are and rules of engagement. So going back, we're trying to bring this back. Rules of engagement. That's exactly, that's exactly why rules of engagement can be tricky, but they shouldn't be.

Speaker 1:          01:20:28       If you train your people well, if the people understand what the strategic mission, if they understand what the parameters, you put the parameters on in there and they're loose enough that people can maneuver inside those parameters. Then occasionally they got to call you up and say, Hey, I had to break the rules. And you say, Oh, what happened? And they explained it, then you go, okay, good call. Yeah, yeah. People need to understand that continuing on urban combat is nearly always conducted at very close quarters. It is not uncommon to have opposing forces fighting from positions a few dozen meters apart. Most of the fighting is done from a distance between 50 and 500 meters due to this close in nature. It is critical to know where the enemy is and how they are deployed. Again, this is a fantasy like knowing where the enemy is and how they're deployed is really hard to do even when you have, even when you have overhead coverage looking in the city, I'll tell, I'll give you an example.

Speaker 1:          01:21:26       I was watching my guys out on a mission. I was watching on a a UAV feed, so we're watching, we're watching and looking for enemy and all of a sudden we see weird activity. There's a vehicle, the vehicle stops, the vehicle kind of moves a little bit stops. Again, guys get out, they look around, open up the trunk and now we're totally focused like, oh, these guys are getting ready to attack. Open up the trunk and as they're starting to pull stuff out of the trunk, My guys get hit from a different spot that we weren't looking cause you can't see everything, especially in a city because think of it with buildings. As soon as you go off angle a little bit, you can't see the street anymore because it's down in the building. So we're, we actually are totally focused on this one thing and maneuvering the, the air asset to look at these people in a car and as, as there as we're monitoring these guys, these suspected enemy personnel, all of a sudden my guys get shot at from somewhere else and we completely miss it.

Speaker 1:          01:22:27       And we continue to watch these guys and they pull out a jack and attire and they lift up the car and they changed the tire and they leave. They're just normal. But it looked very suspect. So to think that you're ever going to know where the enemy is and how they're deployed is very, very challenging. At best you do the best. It doesn't mean you don't try. You definitely try, but you, you don't get all that information. You just don't get it. Those Uavs, how high are those? Depends on the UAV. So like w can you, can they see him? Like can people see them or are they, it depends on the UAV and like I'm, I don't know what the classification of all that is. Saw. I'm not talking about it good. I don't know what the, I just know that they go to different heights.

Speaker 1:          01:23:09       I'll, I'll leave it at that because on the Internet you can see those, you know, those videos. Every once in a while they'll just have them. Then it's like, Dang, those guys don't even see that. Or you know, I don't know if they do or donor good optics to look real good optics. I mean, just imagine, you know, the optics that we have in the civilian sector. Yeah. Even those are good enough to be pretty amazing. Yes sir. So, uh, talking about knowing where the enemy has this lesson was learned the hard way during the initial stages of the battle inside the citadel. During the first two major clashes between marine and Nva forces on the morning of 13, February, 1968, the enemy surprised us and wreaked significant damages very quickly. This was because we weren't exactly sure where they were. Although the, the Arvin, which is the, uh, the South Vietnamese army had been in several major battles inside the citadel.

Speaker 1:          01:23:59       I don't recall receiving any intelligence attribute ID attributed to them regarding the enemy's exact location. Further to my knowledge, no marine recon unit was sent to check out the situation before attacking on the morning of the 13th. So that's rough. And I'll tell you one thing that from my mind, where's the enemy? The enemy is everywhere. And you have to approach things as if the enemy can be anywhere. And the only way you can know that they're not where they're not everywhere is when you take something down and you secure it. That's when you know not there, then you move on.

Speaker 1:          01:24:31       We recommend that all intelligence assets, recon units and surveillance devices that can be made available are deployed in a significant effort to fix the exact location of enemy soldiers and units. Again, this is, you can see where this is coming out of this. For these guys, they must have been completely outflanked all the time where they were thinking, where is the enemy? We need to know where the enemy is and it's a really hard to know that the enemy can combatant who knows where his enemy is. Hiding experiences, experiences a decided advantage in surprise and the deployment of firepower. Of course. Now again, this doesn't, like I'm saying, it's hard to have definitely doesn't mean you mitigate. It doesn't mean you don't put up Uav so you can see maneuver doesn't mean you don't gather intelligence, doesn't mean people shouldn't report back in and explain where they think the enemy is.

Speaker 1:          01:25:18       We at least have an estimate continuing week combat urban combat tactics. The tragedy of urban conflict is that the battlefield for each firefight is a neighborhood. Each objective taken is someone's home or a school or church or some other structure that has value and foe and more or less significant meaning to its inhabitants. Considering the possibilities, it is not difficult to imagine tank battles across mall parking, lots, mortar fire hitting a church, a hospital, a community center, heavy small arms, fire fights between homes and artillery barrage on a school yard. While these images may be grist for the mills of Hollywood, when we think about them in, in relevance to our homes and our neighborhood and churches, the tragedy is somehow increased. However, it is our collective belief that the life of one Marine is more precious than ten one hundred homes, schools, churches, shrines, shopping malls, or any other building known demand.

Speaker 2:          01:26:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:26:23       Therefore, all efforts should be made using any and all weapons tree available to stun the enemy and support marine advances through the use of supporting arms and without regard to damage to buildings. So clearly the whole idea that this started off with of the rules of engagement, that we're restricting heavy fire power because the historical nature of the city, a, if you don't want historical buildings destroyed, don't have a war. And if you think we should save a building and that's going to cost the life of one of our brothers not happening.

Speaker 2:          01:27:02       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:27:05       Continuing at the same time, the use of heavy weapon tree in urban combat isn't assuredly two edged sword as are many assets in modern warfare. Rubble can be nearly as effective as a building for protecting enemy firing positions. Further artillery and other flat trajectory weapons may be somewhat restricted by the height of buildings and their distance from each other. In many cases, mortars, although smaller in caliber were superior because of their higher trajectory. So interestingly, indirect fire, indirect fire taking the indirect approach is often better than the flat trajectory. I'm going to shoot through your front door. No, we're going to lob in some rounds on you. So, so we think about that when we're dealing with people. Punching him in the face is not as good as coming from an indirect position where they don't quite see where it's coming from, but it still gives them a little crack and the, it's even to the point where he says the, um, even though they're smaller in caliber, so even though somebody does something that you want to straighten him out on when you hit him in the face, we know what the reaction is.

Speaker 1:          01:28:14       They get defensive and all the things. When we come from a, from a flank, indirect fire, it's smaller. Caliber is not even as, it's doesn't hate his heart. Yeah. But it's more effective. Yeah. Just more effective indirect fire all day long, continuing supporting arms, supporting arms, the most effective or most effective prior to danger, close to minimize the potential of friendly casualties and maximize preperatory fires to support the infantry's attack during operation wasted. Even the most effective indirect fire during danger close was from an eight inch gun. We recommend that the supporting access of fire be perpendicular as well as parallel. Finally in the event as in the case of operation waste city, that due to political considerations that proper preperatory fires would not be allowed, that a variety of fires such as smoke delayed fuses, high angle can be incorporated with the infantry's attack combined arms training for urban combat is critical.

Speaker 2:          01:29:13       It's cover and move.

Speaker 1:          01:29:15       That's what supporting arms do. They lay down cover so you can maneuver. Other advantage of preperatory fire include the destruction of the camouflage of enemy positions, the psychological shock factor against enemy troops and the fact that heavy weapons can create new avenues of attack and Egress for armored vehicles. Pretty straight forward. One of the most effective aspects of supporting arms during the battle of way where the killer teams that evolved the m 48 tank and the end an Antos and the Antos is like, uh, it's, it's actually a pretty crazy looking machine. It's got 160 106 millimeter like cannons on it and it's got six of them and they're kind of like sticking out. Then it's a light armored vehicles and it's like a tank anti-tank vehicle, but I'm Antos would pair up and maneuver together as a team. This would allow either the tank or the Antos to maneuver into a good fire position where while the other covered

Speaker 2:          01:30:13       covering cover move, thank you.

Speaker 1:          01:30:16       Further, the devastating fire power put out by the 90 millimeter tank cannon and the six one oh six is of the autos turned out to be extremely beneficial because their capabilities to deliver pinpoint of firepower. Armored vehicles can provide many benefits to the infantry engaged in urban combat as they provide some cover from and small arms fire. However, armored vehicles can also become rocket magnets producing casualties for an infantry troops in close proximity. The enemy's going to see that target.

Speaker 2:          01:30:47       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:30:48       and they're going to like it.

Speaker 1:          01:30:50       Yeah, and you, there's advantages to having that power, but there's also disadvantaged, so you have to always weigh those things out. As a leader, you have to pay attention to those things. As a leader, you have to think of every advantage that you have. There's going to be some negative to it. There's going to be some disadvantage when you bring an advantage to the table. There's going to be some disadvantage in Jujitsu, right? If we're going to be super flexible, you're not that strong. Every gonna be Super Superstrong are not that flexible. Your cardio doesn't last very long. Right? So there's going to be advantages and disadvantages that come with each asset that you have. Yeah. So you have to figure you're going to go for full ox. That's cool. You're giving up position. Yeah. There's all kinds of things. You have to weigh those out and as leader you have to look at, don't get, don't get wrapped around the positives of something.

Speaker 1:          01:31:33       Right. Just the positives. There's not just positives for for really anything. Yeah. There's nothing that's just straight positives across the board, I guess. Right? Yeah. I'm sure we could think of something, and I'm sure you could continue with, other than instances of harassment and interdiction fires, buildings that are hit by heavy weapons should be attacked immediately. This is good. Buildings that are hit by heavy weapon should be attacked immediately. Don't hesitate. You catch people off guard. Don't hesitate. Don't hesitate. This happens. This happens in, in everything we, we get a good, a good position or something, an advantageous happens and we hesitated instead of taking the advantage of it, we got, Oh God got to here. Yeah. And then, then we, then we let it go. It happens in business too. We get to a situation all we finally get the, we finally get our competitor to make a mistake or we get an advantage position and we celebrate instead of just finishing the job. Yeah. Which is a big bad thing to do. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:32:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:32:41       Remember that when calling in fire missions, you were can request splash, so you're friendly troops have time to take cover immediately prior to impact, these cats were calling and bombs right on top of them a lot.

Speaker 2:          01:32:51       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:32:52       In daytime operations, that use of covering smoke is often helpful when marines must attack across open areas.

Speaker 2:          01:33:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:33:01       As was learned during operation way city. Even with proper support of heavy weapons, which was ultimately provided to the marines. We faced hardcore north Vietnamese army troops who fought from prepared positions, move to secondary positions, fought again, and finally very reluctantly died and the capture of each room, each for each rooftop, each building, each street. It was ultimately the marine riflemen who won the battle.

Speaker 2:          01:33:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:33:32       As a leader, as a leader, do you always have to remember that line right there in the capture of each room, each for each roof top, each building, each street. It was ultimately the marine rifleman who won the battle. As a leader, if you think that all you need to do is make a good decision and then you're going to win, you're wrong. Yeah. The folks on the front line have to truly understand what is happening and they're the ones are going to carry the day and you could come up with the best battle plan ever. You could come up with the best strategic business plan ever, and if you don't have folks that are engaged and willing and are going to take the fight to the enemy and are going to win that, that foothold, they're going to enter that room. They're going to go out and sell into whatever industry you're trying to get into. If you don't have people that you trust, that are trained, that are ready, that are prepared if you don't have them, best paddle battle plan in the world isn't going to work.

Speaker 2:          01:34:35       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:34:39       Is Critical for infantry units, snow, both the capabilities as well as the limitations of supporting arms know your limitations, right. This is, again, there's positives and there's negatives. Another aspect of supporting arms, limitations to do with helicopter support. Urban terrain is not very forgiving to helicopters that may be forced to make an emergency. Landing helicopter pilots might be reluctant to fly over urban terrain. No. These things. One very tragic aspect of using supporting arms in urban combat is that the likelihood of civilian casualties is very high and at least two situations that we are aware of. The NVA used civilians as screens for their infantry troops and fire missions were of necessity called in on those positions.

Speaker 4:          01:35:35       So no

Speaker 1:          01:35:43       expect pretty discussed these things. Let your troops understand, put them in role plays scenarios where they have to make a decision on what's happening. It's better to think through it 20 times and make 20 mistakes while we're doing some kind of a role play scenario than it is to have to be making that decision for the first time. When you're on the battlefield and you can't discuss, you can't debrief. Yeah. Not to mention the stress that's going to kind of, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

Speaker 1:          01:36:15       Use of chemical weapons during one fives battle inside the citadel fortress, which was kicked off on 13 February, 1968 the battalion progressed a total of four blocks along our avenue of attack and had secured a total of 16 city blocks within our assigned area of operations. After nearly two weeks of heavy street fighting and after suffering nearly 50% casualties at the hands of a well prepared, determined force of Nva soldiers of force that finally estimated that was finally estimated to be nearly 11,000 strong in her waist in the waist city area of operations. On February 25th, 1968 marines from Charlie company shot off three e eight gas launchers caring about 40 cs gas grenades toward the enemy's last known position. The next morning one five took control of the remaining 12 city blocks and about three hours without a single casualty because the NBA was not equipped to deal with tear gas attack and was forced to withdraw.

Speaker 4:          01:37:12       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:37:13       so we're going from 50% casualties to zero.

Speaker 4:          01:37:16       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:37:21       Taking a different approach utilizing weapons that no one was used to utilizing the enemy who's had never had not seen they even have gas masks, they just had to get out of there and that he ate gas lock launcher. It's like a suitcase looking thing and it's got eight tubes that have eight rounds at each in them and it fires him like five seconds apart. So we're talking a lot of gas.

Speaker 4:          01:37:46       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:37:47       Especially they shot off three of them. You don't want none of that.

Speaker 4:          01:37:55       Yeah. No

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       one can never be certain that the use of chemical weapons would have made a difference in the initial stages of the battle, but many of the veterans of that battle have often wondered what might've happened if the [inaudible] had been deployed in the early stages of the battle. We recommend the judicious use of chemical weapons such as tear gas, etc. For combat operations.

Speaker 2:          01:38:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:38:15       Administration planning and preparation. The inherent complexities of urban combat are such that special attention needs to be paid toward planning and preparations. Training, training, training practice makes perfect a coordinated marina tack on an enemy held position at a town or city can be equated to an intricate opera or Broadway production, although the stakes are a bit higher.

Speaker 2:          01:38:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:38:42       Entry techniques, room search and clearing techniques. Voice commands indicating movement or progress, fire discipline, the use of grenades, rockets, supporting fires, communications. All of these must be rehearsed and improved until they are second nature.

Speaker 3:          01:39:01       Second Nature. I was talking to you the other day, you were saying something about my guillotine choke. Yeah. That it was there quickly. Yes. Yeah, and I was saying it's second. It's, I should have said it's second nature because what I did tell you is sometimes I become aware like we'll be rolling and all of a sudden I'll be like, oh, I've got a guillotine right now. Yeah. I didn't even does this way. It just showed up there with zero fought whatsoever. Yeah, yeah. That's how you need to be. Yeah. If I have to think about putting a guillotine on someone, then that means they have time to think about defending the right. Yeah. If I didn't even think about it and it just happened to Sorta, yeah, and not to split hairs. It's less about the gay teens specifically. It's just about your like what do you call it?

Speaker 3:          01:39:53       Head control, you know? You know, you get that Chin Strap, oh, it's that we're, that just arrives and then sure. It will become a good team for sure. We're a cobra or one of these other treacherous moves that you'd like to implement it from time to time. Yeah. But yeah, it's like your head. Well, I feel like, I feel like it's second nature for my head to just land in there. That's what it feels like for sure. But obviously it's you, it's your thing. Oh no, but that's the way we want to trade. That's the way we're going to train it. And I would say, I'll add to this, that what we want to train is we want to train for chaos. We want to train from mayhem. We want to train for the enemy to do things we're not expecting. That's what we want to train for. Because when you train for things at the enemy's not you, that you're not expecting the enemy, do you actually get good at reacting to it? You know, you can get good at scrambling in Jiu Jitsu. Yeah. You can get good at ending up in positions that are beneficial through no conscious thought. But because you've scrambled enough that now you

Speaker 1:          01:40:53       just know what you're looking for. These little, these little things are gonna happen. I'm gonna get the under hook. I'm gonna get my hips in the right spot. I'm gonna move my hand over here. Yeah, that's what we want to do. Yeah. Yeah. Like the old, almost cliched saying to like get comfortable being uncomfortable. The thing you know, it's like, yeah, you train yourself to be uncomfortable or to be trained in being uncomfortable. You can just deal better. But I'm trying to get something, I'm trying to reach a different point here. My point is this, if I, let's say, let's say here's, there's a through z situations I can put you in and they're all different. If I train you for a and B all the time, when I throwed Fmu, you're, you're lost. If I throw Q at You, you're, you're lost. If I train you, so I get you good at a B. But then I start training you at Dsr drone, u, N, F I start throwing you at m.

Speaker 1:          01:41:53       You will start to realize that even in these disparate scenarios, there are some commonalities and there are some base positions that you can go to that will allow you the time to assess and make decisions. You can, you can get good at chaos. That's what I'm saying. You can get good at chaos. Yeah, yeah. You can get good at it. You can say, oh, when I see things happening that I don't understand, here's what I need to do. I need to find a good covered position. Hopefully elevated where I can look around. I need to figure out where my troops are. I need to do it very quickly. I need to identify a prominent terrain feature that I can move all of us to in a rapid manner so that I can get controlled situation right there. Now, with those things that I just said, hey, I'm going to get in a position where I can look around, I'm going to look for, I'm going to try and figure out where my people are going to look for a prominent terrain feature that I can utilize as a stronghold.

Speaker 1:          01:43:03       Guess what I just solved for just about any scenario that unfolds that I don't understand. I have a plan. I have a plan that I can actually implement against any situation. Think about that, so, oh, if I get a contact front, I have a plan or we started getting cog shot up from the front. I weren't in an open ground. I have a plan. It's a standard operating procedure. Oh, I start getting shot at from the front and we're in enclosed terrain. I have a plant. There's a specific immediate action drill. We're going to perform a, wait a second. I'm getting shot at. I'm not sure where it is. I hear screaming. I know that we're getting hit from multiple locations. What do I need to do? I have an immediate action for that too. I'm going to find cover. I'm going to look around. I'm going to and figure out where my troops are and to look for a prominent terrain feature that we can move towards. Yeah. There. Now all of a sudden the chaos isn't really chaos. Right now. All of a sudden I have a plan and I can actually apply that plan to almost any scenario. Yeah. So the more that you train people for things that they don't expect and don't understand, the better they will get it. Dealing with those things. Yeah. And that's very positive. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:44:22       Moving on further, all plans must be communicated and rehearsed at each level of command from the fire team to the company and above. It sounds like these guys did not have good decentralized command in terms of actually knowing what the overall plan was. Cause it sounds like the fire teams were there, even a platoon and fire team levels were a little bit lost at points in particular platoon commanders, platoon sergeants and squad leaders and fire team leaders must be aware of each man's assignment. This should include who goes into a structure first, who covers cover and move nowadays. Cause we've done it in the U s military, we've done so much urban combat in the last, what has it been 17 years. Every military unit in the u s military, they can take down a structure and they do it well and they do it off of standard operating procedures, not off of a specific plan of who goes where.

Speaker 4:          01:45:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:45:26       Continue on hand and arm signals as well as vocal commands should be established and practiced

Speaker 1:          01:45:36       and the last section is called command and control in full scale urban conflict, especially in situations where enemy dispositions are not well known. Initial contact with the enemy can be a unexpected to be at very close range and see massively devastating command and control. The basic marines connection to his leadership can disappear in the blink of an eye during operation way. City Charlie one five lost all of its officers except for two sergeants became platoon commanders. Pfcs were squad leaders in urban combat. It would not be at all surprising to find Pfcs as platoon commanders given the potentially high casualty rates. The critical factor for Unit survival in these situations is that units ability to immediately determine the enemy's position and to return a high volume of sustained fire on those positions. Allowing maneuverability despite the situation with the chain of command who two critical things there cover and move as one and decentralized command is to, that's what they're talking about. You need to be able to put down high a heavy volume of sustained fire on positions so that you can maneuver and, and at the same time you need to be able to do that regardless of the situation with the chain of command. Decentralized Command.

Speaker 4:          01:47:03       Hm.

Speaker 1:          01:47:06       During the first day of one fives involvement in operation waste, city Alpha company lost its CEO. It's Xo and much of the company CP Group of necessity. Alpha was pulled back to the battalion rear for reorganization. The loss of a few leaders effectively eliminated an entire company. This also delayed the battalion's attack, blunting our initiatives. You've got to have a plan. If people go down who's taken over, that's gotta be, that's gotta be ready. The individual marine who is under heavy enemy fire from very close range who may now be caught off from his team and or squad leader needs to have been thoroughly informed of communications codes, lines of departures, lines of stoppage, friendly unit dispositions, and the ability to call and supporting fires and conduct contingency plans. What does that mean? That means the troops need to understand what is happening in short in urban conflict situations. Command and control needs to be understood at every level down to the basic marine. Based on our experiences during operation way, city expect the unexpected, expect chaos and plan for all possibilities. And it's signed Scott Nelson, first lieutenant commanding officer Charlie one five Nick War, Second Lieutenant Platoon Commander Charlie one five Travis Curd, second lieutenant artillery. Forward Observer attached to Charlie one five and John Mullen, Staff Sergeant Platoon Sergeant Charlie one five

Speaker 1:          01:48:55       nick war is his name. W a R. R. Hmm. Pretty stoked to be born with that war was, he's in the Marine Corps. What's your name? My name is actually or yeah. So, uh, yeah. And, and to hear from these guys and, and this is this, this document which is now, well it's 50 years old, 1968 and there's still lessons learned in this that apply to really apply to everything, apply to life, a blighted urban combat, apply to business, apply to leadership. So there you have it. And of course when we see the way broadly we can recognize it more, we can see it in more things and it makes us more effective leaders regardless of the battlefield that we're on. So read and appreciate the lessons of the past and echo. Speaking of the way, I know, I know Jujitsu is sort of beneficial, sort of helpful in allowing us to understand the way more clearly and perhaps even more broadly, I don't know if you have any recommendations of how we could sort of

Speaker 5:          01:50:25       get in the game and stay in the game. It's funny you mentioned Jitsu is like a way to recognize things like it's so it's such a metaphor even to use the word metaphor seems like it's like detailed like it is life in so many ways. Like all, even this thing that I'm listening to you read, I'm like, oh yeah. Did you do every single one? I just don't want to bore everyone with, okay. More Jujitsu stuff

Speaker 1:          01:50:53       on the judo podcasts that we did, I was talking about the fact that I, I have to give credit some credit to Jujitsu for sort of revealing to me the thread that tied all these things together was JP was in town. Sure. And we were rolling Jujitsu yesterday and I was thinking as like, well actually when we were done, I was thinking, man, when we were in Ramadi 12 years ago, I was a black belt in Jujitsu. Like I like, it was beneficial for me then to a bit of black belt in Jujitsu. Not because I wasn't going out and grappling against the enemy, but I had already started to connect some of these dots. Yeah. And it's very, very helpful in life. It's also helpful because it is a physical representation that you can feel and you can see. Yeah. It's not a theory.

Speaker 1:          01:52:00       Yeah. There's theory behind it, but it's not a theory. It's happening to you. And therefore when it happens to you, you have something physical, something concrete, something that you actually experienced on a physical level. And if you, and that allows you to understand it metaphorically better. Yeah. Like when you get caught, when someone's trying to choke you and then Bolton, they arm lock you, you've just got flanked. Yes. That just happened to you. It's not metaphorical. You, you truly understand what it feels like to get flanked. Yes. If I explain to you, hey, when I'm telling you this thing over here, and then I come at you from another angle, you understand it. You're, you're, you're just starting to grasp, grasp of the concept,

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       but it didn't happen to you. But when I'm trying to choke you and you go for the defense and then boom, you get arm locked and you didn't see it coming at all, you feel a flank, you feel the effectiveness of it in real time, in real time. And that's why it's very beneficial to train some of that Jujitsu feel experience, the laws of combat field. Yeah. You, you'll have a better comprehension of them. Yeah. And that's like a profound level too. Like that's like a, that's good. If you can keep that in mind and then you can go on the other side of the spectrum where it's like, it's you just fighting with your friends with no consequence. You know, where I think a lot of the time, what does that mean? Like if mean if you go, hey, let's go train right now what we're going to do when you say, let's go train.

Speaker 5:          01:53:39       Sure, we might go over some toe. Oh, we're fighting. But without real consequence, we don't lose friendship. We don't get injured. Uh, we don't get, you know, rest of all that stuff that, but we get to like fight, you know, I don't, that's also good. Yeah. So in, here's the thing, like, here's a thing, like some people in, I think we, most people like we'd like fighting, but we don't want to like fight people. Like, I don't want to fight everyone, you know? Well, because then you can get arrested. Well, sure. Most people, like I said, we don't want just fight because there's all kinds of different reasons or whatever. But when you can, just, when you have the opportunity to, to fight someone with no consequence, just to see how it would go. You know, like if he's, you know, these huge, huge men, you know, the guys who were like seven feet tall, 400 pound, just huge and strong man and stuff like that.

Speaker 5:          01:54:37       You don't want to necessarily fight them, but you're like, I wonder, I wonder, I lucked. That would be like roll with them to fight with that guy. You know when you do Jujitsu, you get that, you get that opportunity straight up and you want to, you want to try, if I eat this, I wonder how many people out there wondering, I wonder would it be to fight Jocko to say I would beat him up. Not to say I wouldn't, but I wonder how it would be that it's a lot of people show up at the gym and Oh, and that's exactly why. And that's one point. The funny thing is it doesn't matter if they're white belts or black belts. Yeah. They still like, yeah. See what up, see how that experience is, you know, they usually smiling. Yeah, fully. And really when it comes down to it, I mean, unless you're trying to hurt someone, you know, and there's a bunch of different ways to hurt someone if you want to hurt them because they don't like gum or you think they should, you know they deserve it or all this stuff. It's not about that. It can be about that for sure. But that's not ultimately what it is. It's more about like I wonder, I wonder how it beat a fight that person. And then when you start to learn more and more and more, you just, you really just enjoy that activity. Like quite get to fight like right now if I wanted to, if you had the time or whatever, I mean you, we could go, we could go right now. Yeah. And it'd be like in a good safe way to wrap this up then.

Speaker 5:          01:55:52       But you see what I'm saying? No, that's the way to do it anyway. Okay. All right. Back to the path. That's the path. Inappropriate part of the path. By the way, you wouldn't be you without Jujitsu? I wouldn't, you wouldn't even be like happening. Especially if you knew

Speaker 1:          01:56:06       I wouldn't be happy at all. Yeah. Especially if I knew. But on top of that, I wouldn't have connected things that I, that Jujitsu connected for me. Yeah. There's something else. I would not be who I am. I'm going to straight up say yes. I would not be who I am without Jujitsu. Yeah. And you wouldn't be who? You would not be on this podcast without Jujitsu. No, I couldn't even talk to you.

Speaker 5:          01:56:38       I believe it's a stretch anyway. It's a stretch anyway, but when I'll do too, I'll be at least there. So without that would be talking about TV shows and I'd be like, I'd be like muting your microphone or something. Let's see. So did you get to, hey, it's a lifesaver. Get you into all kinds of different things, but even if you're trying to stay on the path, okay, I'm dragging it. I dig it, man. But it's important when you're, when you're trying to get on the path, stay on the path, be beat on the path. It's only fitting for real. It's only fitting. Okay. Let's say, okay, let's say you have weapons training suite. Let's say you can drive a car really well. Cool. You can hunt, you can, you're capable, you can, you know all this stuff, right? But if you're stripped away of like your tools, oh then one man on man.

Speaker 5:          01:57:35       Yeah. Just don't have the Jujitsu. Yeah. And this is more of just a real general way to look at it. So it's like you ever watch men in black one? I can't really remember too much about it. This might not even be the movie, but it's, it's a movie with one of the, it's like this big rope creature, right? And then they find out it's just a suit. And in the inside there's just this little worm type person thing, you know, they're kind of, you know, oh, so you're saying if I didn't do Jujitsu, I would just be like a little worm, big strong guy or whatever. But then like if all your tools were taken away, what are you left with kind of thing. Isn't it weird when you, when you

Speaker 1:          01:58:15       meet people that are that like they don't, they're like big. Yeah. Maybe even their strong, maybe even their aggressive. Yeah, but they, they don't have, they don't have a skill. They don't have the skill. Right. That's kind of a bummer. That's essentially, here's this, here's the situation that people might be listening and think, okay, well let's say you're in the situation where you don't have the skill. You have two options. Option one is the easy path,

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       which is I'm just never going to get that skill. Never to go near Jujitsu. I'm never going to get in a confrontation with anybody because I don't want to be proven to myself that I'm a warm inside of a suit or you can take the hard path, which is, even though I'm 37 years old, I'm bummed that I missed out on the bar. You know, I took me awhile, but you know what? I'm going to go figure this out. Yeah. I'm going to go at least learn some of it. I'm going to at least learn some of it. I would take that even though I know it's hard because people, you know when you're, when you get older you don't want to try something new. Even though it's proven that learning something new is completely beneficial for your mental and physical health. Yeah. And ice and yeah, it's not all like pleasurable roses and stuff. I don't know. Did you know there's some, there's some struggle in there, but tell me about it. There's there, there's dean lister. I was, I was in turtle position. Dean lister is shoulders healing back up. I was internal position mount and side control for 22 minutes the other day. And that's a struggle. And also he was pushing my face into the mat and saying, what color is the mat?

Speaker 3:          02:00:08       See? Like as you see what I'm saying, well what does that fun? The answer's no, no. That's high level struggle because the typical person you go into, that's not gonna happen to you. So that's, that's like the struggle that's going to get someone that has a personal vendetta on your existence that Dean has on mine. Yeah. Yeah. I think it was a CD called kill Jocko does indeed. Factually. Nonetheless. All right. There's going to be some struggle in there. You get it, but you jump in there just like everything. When you learn golf, there's gonna be a struggle. No, you're going to miss that hole sometimes, but I know it's a different kind of struggle, but on a fundamental level it's all the same struggle here. Nonetheless, you're going to need a g and when you get your g you're going to go to origin main.com get an origin gets.

Speaker 3:          02:00:53       It's the best kind of made in America from the cotton grown in America loomed or we've woven for woven in America, assembled, sewn, stitched, presented, enjoyed in utilize, utilize in America in America actually can be utilized where for but none the less, I mean in America and they are factually, no, not my opinion. Sounds like an opinion, but it's factually there. Factually the best firm in the world. What's cool is the geese are awesome, but there's a problem. It's a problem. The problem is you can't wear a geek to the store, to the restaurant. No, not really. And yet you were the origin pants and you think, man, I wouldn't mind, you know, if they had a pocket I would roll out. Right. Yeah. Especially if you get the black ones, you know, like it's not, it's not crazy to think, hey, maybe I'll just kind of roll out to the store or maybe go take my wife out for dinner.

Speaker 3:          02:01:53       No, but that's okay because guess what we got now denim or jeans dig it. Yeah. Yeah. So those are common. Yeah. Not quite out yet, but I got mine. Yeah. I don't have mine and texting Pete, Bruh. I don't want to buy and eat a pizza and he's busy, man. He does a lot. And I don't want to, I don't want to, my personal interests start to create roadblocks or speed bumps and get this whole thing, but I do want those jeans though. That's a thing. So I got to balance that. A little dichotomy, my personal interest in the interest of Pete and his discourse. Nonetheless, I will have them. We will have, when did they come out then in the process of coming out? Right now you have the material. We are cutting the material now. We're so in the material. Yeah. It's interesting cause I don't really get excited about James or I don't get it, like new genes coming out or the new iPhone.

Speaker 3:          02:02:50       I don't get excited about that kind of stuff. But for some reason I'm kinda excited about, tell you why I'm a little bit excited about it because of this. Jeans are American, right? Genes represent America. Let's face it, if you wanted to draw a stereotypical American human, they'd be wearing a pair of jeans. Here's the problem. Jeans were made in America. Jeans were invented in America. Genes became famous in America. And then we sold our soul and put them overseas. Let them get manufactured overseas, something that shouldn't have happened. And so to bring it back to America, does that feel good? Indeed? Yes, it does. It makes sense. I dig it. So, yeah, bring back in the soul. Um, other clothes, their tee shirts and stuff from origin. If you can get, even if you don't want jeans, you could get joggers right now. Quick supplements to joint warfare, Krill oil discipline, discipline, go discipline go.

Speaker 3:          02:03:53       So when I work, sometimes I have to work for two, three straight hours without any interruptions. Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. You see what I'm saying? So I would be drinking discipline and all of a sudden I'm an hour and 40 minutes in. And guess what? I got to hit the head. Well, the restroom break. Yeah. So that's why we made discipline goal. Just Morgan is just a, uh, a pill. Is that what it's called? A capsule and it's got the, uh, got the goodness in it. And we also have coming the discipline going to can you had drink? Yeah. That's like if you had it yet. Yes. That's the one where like we were, it was that, did that give you one in New York when we were in, did the New York, I had one before that they sent me. So yes. Good. I got it. I got more coming today.

Speaker 3:          02:04:42       Hopefully will be here, but um, yeah, so that'd be common. Of course we got Moeloek, which apparently doctor Luke hates mint chocolate chip passionately. And so when I heard him going off the other day, like why would you want anything that tastes like toothpaste, toothpaste? So we have a little disagreement. We'll have to settle that one on the mat, but he's just going with peanut butter vanilla grill or something. Good. And don't forget about the war. Your kid milk. No kidding. Yeah, it tastes like strawberry. Nestle's strawberry quick. That's what it tastes like. Can I say that? Is that legal? Yes. Okay. Okay. Whether it's legal or not, I can say I did say it and it's tastes exactly like that. I'm using that exactly like it's strawberry, Nestle's Quik, but it has no sugar. It's got awesome protein and it will make your kid into the next, you're about to say something illegal right now.

Speaker 3:          02:05:40       The next squared away athlete. There you go. Smart. Yes. I was going to name names, but I'm not going to name names, but so that's what works in main.com. Yeah, that's a good officer. They're all my people, all my people up at origin that are working every day, someone cutting, stitching, moving, shipping and make pretty much getting after it big time. Also, we have a store, it's called Jocko store, you know, stuff a little bit more formulated for representing the path itself. Um, you know, a little bit skewed, but some good stuff on there. Some new stuff on there too by the way. Oh really? Yeah, they uh, the traveler travel mugs. Okay. Kind of new. Good. Uh, I'm putting it hoodie up there, but black on black. I like that. It's subtle heavy. Okay. Is it heavy? Is it legit? Heavy, legit, heavy, legit.

Speaker 3:          02:06:33       Like it's the head. Is it the heaviest, heaviest one in existence? I'm sorry to say no, but is there one that you've ever made? Yes. It's, I want noticeably heavier to them than the original black on black. All right. You got it. Two of them nonetheless. Good stuff on their rash guards on there too for Jujitsu for did you did to representing the path big time on now. And also you can do other stuff with rash guards as well. But, um, yeah, some good stuff on there. If you want to represent support, stay on the path. That's where you go, Jocko. store.com. Here's the thing about getting new stuff too, and this is, this is, this is where six year old echo brain comes out and there's a straight up, but it's still apply. It's still didn't, if this dawns on me from time to time, especially when it hits me, when you get like a new thing, right?

Speaker 3:          02:07:22       I've talked about this before. When you get a new rash guard, six years old bra, you don't even act he life. You know? And I think, I think you think the same thing. I think you feel the same way. You won't necessarily admit it, especially not to me, but I think you, I think you feel the same way. Okay? If you got a new thing of something that, that excites me to get new and um, you keep doing what you're doing. I'll think of something over here. We'll, we'll think surfboard, think whatever. Nonetheless. There you go. So if you get a new, a rash guard, a new gooey, um, even new socks, sometimes new shoes, new socks, 1843, I get the socks from audit from it, I get fired up nonetheless. You get something new, get a rash guard. This is get after it. If you don't have one already, you will be looking forward to going to Jujitsu that much more. And that's the good thing about like these things that represents the pounds.

Speaker 3:          02:08:15       It's a hundred percent correct. Try it. Try. Actually I would say for anyone who has like, you know, a shirt or whatever, they felt it. Oh that's what I, that's what I predict. No, I, I understand what you're saying and it actually is true when people, when you get the, you know, that's the classic classic scene from literature. Sure. When is the, I think it's like the dawning of the uniform of the, of the warrior and they do it in movies to the collage. They, you know, the, the heroes putting his boots on and then he's putting his web gear on. And even just when people see the superheroes secret thing opens up and all of his gears in there, it is all fired up. Like the vet, the old fet das go into that chest in his or like in, in Mike and the dragons.

Speaker 3:          02:09:07       You know when he's opening, opening up the chest filled with war gear. You know everyone got a little fired up. Yeah cause they understand exactly right. There we go. Same deal anyway Jocko, store.com you want to represent on the path, get fired up about stuff. There you go. She's something like grab something also Jocko white tea. We're still doing that. I'm still doing that big time because I was never a tea person. And W I mean I'm saying that's, that's saying something because I was never a tea person. But guess what? Look at me. Tea person that will kind of, I only drink this tea but you know I'm into it. Jocko. White tea person. Big Time. How's that deadlift? Huge. 8,100 pounds. Actually I've been sticking with it. Hey subscribe to the podcast. If you haven't iTunes, Google, play, stitcher, leave reviews. So I can read them.

Speaker 3:          02:09:58       Yeah, if you will. If you want. If you don't want them, don't what? Also worry or kid podcasts, subscribe to that. While I was on a podcast yesterday and they asked me to say subscribe to their podcast and I said, I don't even ask people to subscribe to my podcast. And I was like, well actually I got to do and now I just did. Yeah, maybe it's actually you and I had this discussion many times. I was like, why do we need to cause you, you like when people need to do to subscribe. Maybe they haven't subscribed. I mean, we're 162 podcast deep. That's gotta be four or 500 hours of listening. You don't think someone hit subscribe yet. Well I, I agree with you fully so we can, can we cut this out now? Yeah. You wrote this by the way, but yeah, of course we can.

Speaker 3:          02:10:43       Well this is, this is a carryover carryover. Oh yes. Look, it's us doing what we talked about before earlier today about doing things like, because that's just how you know, you gotta think. Got To think, why do we want to waste five seconds of someone's time telling him? It just sounds kind of like, what is it like what do you call it? Redundant or something. It's kind of like, um, do you think everyone, who do you think anyone ever got to this 0.3 hours deep into the podcast and you are, I said and subscribing and they reached down to, they're like, oh my gosh. Yeah. Oh shoot, I can do that. Hey, let me tell you what you might forget. You might forget to subscribe to the warrior kid podcast because it's not coming out quite as consistently at this time, but it is a great podcast for you or for your kids to listen to, to get them on the path. Yeah, they can also, if you have kids, that's a good one. Oh, if you have kids is definitely a good one. If you don't have kids, it's not a bad one. Yeah, you can learn some real fundamental. Those are lessons that you kind of forget.

Speaker 3:          02:11:52       That's what I think. I also get to war kids soap, Irish oaks, ranch.com got young aid and warrior kid making soap. Yeah, just having his own business. Yeah. Throw him some support. Whatever. Irish oaks, ranch.com real soap too by the way. This like Ooh, kit on the line and put my flavor in there and sell it. You can do that. Oh I didn't know you could do that. How that, do you even know that I, you know, get all kinds of weird knowledge on the left. Don't forget about youtube and that's where you can see echoes, legit videos and when you get done watching the video, make sure you hit some. Nonetheless, we do have a youtube channel. That's the point. That is the point because you know if you liked the video version or you didn't know there was a video version, you can leave comments there too.

Speaker 3:          02:12:45       I read them, I read youtube comments even though Joe Rogan tells me not to. Yeah, cause you do. That's a slippery slope because if a comment comes and it like it say what's the worst can comment is the kind that's true or kind of true that like just like are you were saying like it won't hit you. It's not a hard punch. It's a little indirect fire. It's an indirect fire but more effective like you know in your neck or something. It's like that. It has to be a little bit true. I actually, I think I've told you this before, but I was one night I was reading youtube comments to my oldest daughter about me cause they were, and I forget it was, it wasn't our podcast, it was, it was a different podcast, a podcast that maybe people weren't as much on board with the programs they had.

Speaker 3:          02:13:29       It's a lot of really colorful to see. Yeah. So I think just you, Joe Rogan saying to you like, don't read them and this is why he doesn't like that. He just, you know, he doesn't say it like, Hey, hey Jocko. Don't know what I'm saying. Like he's like, oh you can't read the youtube comments man. He'll say it like that. Yes. And that's what I mean. So you just knowing that allows you to go in and know like, okay, you can read them and you just got to know that that's accessible. Most of them now in Jordan Peterson like says he reads it, but like they impact him. Yes. He just, no, he didn't mean it. No, no. Joe Rogan need to tell him that. You got to tell them, hey, that's like, that's not a normal comment section is what I'm saying. It's not like on Instagram where it's like, hey, you know, it's like, it's just different.

Speaker 3:          02:14:09       The dynamic, Bruh. I used to make these videos, you know this, but I used to make these videos like parodies of like Darth Vader goes on dates and then I made this one. You put those on my channel, on our channel, on your channel. People still watch it. I mean they're funny. And Jeff Gla, but I made this one a bikini light saber battle. Gloria and them, they're just fighting with light sabers at the beach or whatever and well, you know, you know people watch him. But man, I look at the comments on that, man. It's like people, I think someone wanted me to die. He said, whoever made this should die, like literally said that. I was like, what was the hating about it? What were they hitting about it? It was dumb. Oh, okay. Which it is by the way. Yeah, it's like two girls.

Speaker 3:          02:14:54       They're mad at something and then they fight lightsaber and then like she wanted the girl kills the other one and then like Spiderman comes out is basically all the props that I had at my house. I was like, let me make a video, you know? And so it was like, you know, it was dumb for sure, but probably you don't have to say that Ken comments like that, I got to die now because it's dumb. Anyway, the point is, yeah, you gotta, you gotta kind of know that that's not a normal comments. Youtube there. I get it. I get good entertainment out of it. It's pretty fun. Also got psychological warfare. That's on iTunes, Google play, MP three platforms. And that is a album with tracks about how to overcome various stages of weakness that you might occur that might occur during your day. That's all we're going to say about that one.

Speaker 3:          02:15:39       That's good. That's very concise. It's Jocko though, by the way, on the track. So that's something also on it. On it.com/jocko this is where I get all my kettle bells and socks. Like I mentioned. It seems odd like why you just get socks from on it because they're freaking dope. You ever watch the, he ever look at the socks on on it or a freaking good? Yeah, really good. You want to flex on? The guys had her, I got all of them. So weird flex but okay. No. When you want to flex at the, uh, at the people at the Tsa I keep, I keep wanting to use the term flex second. That's modern way because my kids use it and I keep wanting to use it. Keep trying men. Yeah. I think you're doing pretty good. But no, I haven't really appropriately used it yet.

Speaker 3:          02:16:26       Will you used weird flex but okay on to me. Not about me. Like you were, you were saying about someone else? Uh, no, because Casey had a video that was called that it was called weird flux, but okay. And that's when I realized it was a thing that, that that's an actual thing. Weird flex, but okay. No, you told me it was a thing that I don't use it, I want to use it, but it's sort of a humble brag, right? No, like weird flex. It's, yeah. It's like you're bragging about something kind of weird to brag about, but cool man, dude, do what you do kind of thing. Oh, that's what the, that's what Casey's video was weird flecks of what okay. Was about, he was in, he's in a movie and he was kind of like flexing that he was in a movie and he was like, but okay. Yeah, here's all fired up. Yeah. It'd be more like, Hey, like I can turn my eyelids inside out. Okay. All right. We are flags because flex was a little stronger.

Speaker 3:          02:17:26       You see what I'm saying? Nonetheless on it. This is where you get your fitness stuff, probably you, you know how were we all have home gyms? Most of us. Yeah. And you know you want a day, you want some more kettle bells. You want some jump ropes, battle ropes, like stuff, more good stuff to keep you on the path, keep you in shape. That's where you go on it. Dot. If you want to get your mind in shape, your brain in shape, then you should read. If you want to read some books that I wrote, then cool. You can read Mikey and the dragons. Best Children's book ever for children under the age of six voted by me and you and our children and our children. Actually, someone asked my daughter, my middle daughter the other day, what's your favorite book of Your Dad's? And she said, Mikey and the dragons.

Speaker 3:          02:18:14       Interesting. My daughter didn't, we didn't have any kind of official like, oh, what's the best one? But the one that she always reaches for pushes for is where the warrior kid to months mission. She likes marks mission. So there's that. So there's Mike in the dragons. There's way the warrior could to Mark's mission. There's way the court warrior kid one, we're just called way of the warrior kid soon to be way the warrior kid three writing is complete. John Bozak is knee deep in the art right now and that will be coming out in the spring. I'm going to get it on Amazon for preorder as early as I possibly can. So we don't have another scenario like we had with Mikey, the dragons where we bought, you all bought a lot of them and I didn't have them on hand. Let's say I did give him everybody, everybody by Christmas. So look for that one way the warrior kid three will be coming out. And then of course we got discipline equal freedom field manual, which is awesome to see that impact people. And it's also a good gift to give to people that maybe need a little help. Yeah, just kinda steer me the right direction. Extreme ownership and the dichotomy of leadership. Those are the leadership books that I wrote with my brother Leif Babin and

Speaker 1:          02:19:29       they will help you with your organization and in Your Business and in your life lead. And when also we got to echelon front, which is my leadership consultancy. It's me, it's Leif Babin JP to know Dave Burke, Flynn Cochran at Mike's Rally. Mike by Emma. There's a picture of that echoes into the picture on the website. Yeah man. But he's not, he's not one of the leadership instructors. He is one of the leadership instructor filmers. Right? Uh Hey man, I'm on the website. So that's really all. So what we do is we solve problems through leadership, go national in front.com for that. We also have the monster coming up 2019 it's going to be May 23rd and 24th in Chicago, September 19th and 20th in Denver and December 4th and fifth in Sydney, Australia. Check out a treme, ownership.com they all have sold out and this will solve a sell out as well.

Speaker 1:          02:20:35       And when you go to that your going to get granular explanations, multiple angles on how to work and apply this stuff and if you can't come to muster, guess what, you can go somewhere else. You can go to eff online.com this is what we put together. It took us about nine months to film put together design. It's me and the rest of the Ashkelon Front team training leadership through technology and it's available for, we originally designed it for enterprise for companies that we work with that have 48,000 employees and we can't travel the globe and train them all so we put this stuff online and it's also available now direct to consumer [inaudible] dot com and also we have EFO Overwatch. Yeah overwatch.com where we are connecting proven leaders from combat aviation and from special operations and we're plugging them into companies that need leadership to win at their mission. So giddy go to f overwatch.com if you need that and if you want to pass on lessons learned to us, we are kicking it on the interwebs, on Twitter, on Instagram and on Facebook. Echo is adequate. Charles and I am at jockowillink and of course thanks to all of our military personnel around the world

Speaker 1:          02:22:10       who stand their ground to protect us and also thank you to our police and law enforcement, the firefighters, the paramedics and EMT, the correctional officers, the folks on patrol in all the first responders who stand their ground here at home to protect us.

Speaker 2:          02:22:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:22:34       And everyone else. I always say that time is short, but most of us have more than six seconds. The six seconds that Corporal Jonathan Yale and Lance Corporal Jordan Herger had to make the ultimate decision and the ultimate sacrifice. They could have had more time

Speaker 2:          02:23:08       had they run away,

Speaker 1:          02:23:11       but they sacrificed it all.

Speaker 2:          02:23:16       Okay?

Speaker 1:          02:23:17       They gave up their time, but we, we still have time to time they gave to us.

Speaker 2:          02:23:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:23:26       So don't waste it. Not six minutes of it, not six seconds of it, not one second of it. None of it get out there every second of every day. Get after it. You're no till next time. This is echo and Jocko

Speaker 2:          02:23:50       out.
