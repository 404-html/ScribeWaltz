Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number one 59 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good evening. Good evening.

Speaker 2:          00:00:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:11       There's a a terrible feeling in the gut that I've only felt while I was overseas in Iraq, and it's, it's this deeply distressed kind of sick feeling and it literally feel it in your gut. Literally feel it in your stomach, in my stomach. And it's not. It's not the fear. It's not fear. It's not. It's not the fear of death. Because when you get to a point, when you kind of accept that death is a possibility and you're okay with it, then that fear kind of goes away. And it's not the fear of one of your guys being wounded to kill. It's not that either, because even that fear, even that fear you, you, you kind of get a control of that fear because you know you can't dwell on it because you know, if you dwell on the fear of one of your guys getting wounded or getting killed, then that's going to detract from the very thing that you're supposed to be doing. That will most likely prevent your guys from being wounded or killed. If you're dwelling on that fear, you won't be doing the things you should be doing like planning and training and preparing and inspecting and reviewing and leading. So even that fear, wallets persistent and heavy and potent, it's you have some level of control over it.

Speaker 2:          00:02:06       But

Speaker 1:          00:02:07       when something goes wrong, when something happens

Speaker 2:          00:02:15       and

Speaker 1:          00:02:17       you're responsible and the burden of command settles down with its mantra, mantras, monstrous weight on top of your shoulders because there's no one else to blame. That's what I'm talking about. It actually, I felt it for the first time really a little bit during my first deployment that I did to Iraq and my platoon, we, we did what we were supposed to do. Some things didn't go right now, nothing crazy, but mistakes were made and it was actually back to back to back missions with related targets that we're going after. And I was the assault force commander and I think one of my might've even been the ground force commander. So I was clearly responsible for these missions and there were some mistakes made. And my commanding officer came and spoke to me about it, you know, pulled me aside to point out the mistakes and the resulting impacts that these mistakes we're going to have. And he wasn't happy. I mean he wasn't, he wasn't mad because we had a good relationship and he was talking to me just straight, but he wasn't happy. And you know, I kept a calm face and I took ownership and said, hey my fault, this is the things we're going to do to fix it. You know.

Speaker 1:          00:03:41       But even though I kind of kept a calm face in front of him when he left eye again, I felt like this retching in my stomach debt that I had made some kind of mistake. And, and one of the worst things about it is there's nothing you can do. Like the mistake happened. You can't go back, you can't fix it. And I can't compare that feeling to anything else really that I've felt cause cause I've never felt anything else that feels like that. And I've, I've talked about it with my friends and leadership positions overseas and, and like, actually the first time, uh, it was actually stoner that talked to me about this, this gut feeling and he had something going on and you know, he's like, he's like, you know, that feeling? And I was like, Oh yeah, I know that feeling. And like I said, I've never, I've never felt this feeling, this gnawing feeling in your gut that's eating you from the inside.

Speaker 1:          00:04:41       I think you see it sometimes. Um, if you watch, you know, some movies try and capture this feeling of where it's basically where someone's life is falling apart, but they're trying to keep up a facade up that everything's going okay. Have you ever seen the movie Fargo? No. Okay. I got you on this one. This movie Fargo. There's a guy and he's, he's a car salesman and he's been fudging the numbers and then he's, he's, he's trying to kill someone. There's all these things are happening and it's all, and he's a very, I would say, a very naive person. And he's married and he's got kids and he's trying to do this stuff that's not right and he knows it and it's starting to come apart and that that's the kind of thing we, you can see it's just eating him from the inside. So I think it's that, that type of gnawing deep feeling where everything is going wrong and there's nothing you can do about it. That's the, that's the closest I, I think I can call, is it just when things are going so wrong and there's nothing you can do about it? And I think that that feeling, that feeling for me, I think that's why, number one, that's why I always say combat is humbling. It's because of that feeling right there where you, something went wrong. You couldn't stop it, you couldn't control it, you can't fix it. It is what it is and

Speaker 3:          00:06:09       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:06:10       that makes it humbling. Extremely humbling. And because of that,

Speaker 1:          00:06:18       it made me want to make sure that I did everything humanly possible to prevent from that, to prevent that feeling from grabbing hold of me again. If, if I could help it. It opened up my mind. It made me, it made me always want to listen to other people's input. Cause I always said to myself, wait, if I didn't see what was going on over here, how do I ever know where my blind spots are? I always think I must have blind spots somewhere. There must be something. I see something I don't understand. How can I listen? I need to make sure I listen to other people's viewpoints and perspectives so that I don't, so I can cover and, and yeah. Covers many blind spots as possible. Hmm. Review other methods and other ideas and other principals to see what I could learn from them. And when people raise opposing points to me, I don't object to them. I don't bristle up and it's, I, it doesn't offend me when somebody says something that isn't, that I don't agree with. It doesn't offend me at all. In fact, I want to know more about it.

Speaker 1:          00:07:34       And as I, as I go through my life, I try and continue to listen. I try to absorb opposing opinions and process them. And I want to just understand them. I want to understand the context of him. I want to understand the perspective of them. It's, it's how I think I'm going to eliminate as many blind spots as possible. So when someone would tell me like a new tactic, right when new tactic, when I was in the, in the teams and someone say, Hey, we're doing this now and there's of course when somebody tells you something new, there's always a part of you that says that bristles up to it. And I again, those humbling situations, that feeling in my gut that I didn't want to feel it, it pushed that, that ego down because I actually want to hear what your ideas, I want to hear if this is a blind spot I haven't noticed I want, I want that idea to work. I want to see how it works. I want to see if it works and sometimes they would work and it's any and I would learn something. Sometimes they wouldn't. You know, sometimes it would reconfirm the reason and then that person would learn, hey, the reason we don't do what you're wanting to do is because of this. And so now I'm helping them with a blind spot that they might have. But either way, my goal was always to learn

Speaker 1:          00:08:57       to hear other people's viewpoints and that's the way I remain today. Eh, those other viewpoints are going to make me sharper, right? I'm going to read things so that I can see them from other angles, understand things from other ankles they can strike. When you understand something from another angle, you can strengthen your position or you can leave your position. If you realize that our position is wrong and I, and it's going to make me better, and it's made me better not from me, not because I want to be better, but for the people that are around me, the people up and down the chain of command, that I'm trying to support them so I can do my job better as a leader, as a follower and as a person and also so that I can as much as humanly possible, avoid that wretched, seizing, miserable feeling in my guts. So I was thinking a lot about that. And tonight we're going to explore some principles of war actually called general rules by this individual Machiavelli. This is the good Machiavelli, Niccolo Machiavelli. This is the guy that wrote the prince. He's got all kinds of great quotes out there. It's better to be feared than loved if you can. If you cannot be both. He's got never, never was anything great achieved without danger.

Speaker 1:          00:10:37       Here's one. If an injury has been done, if an entry has to be done to a man, it should be so severe. That is vengeance need not be feared. That's pretty ruthless. Here's another one, a hence it comes about that all armed profits have been victorious and all on armed profits have been destroyed.

Speaker 3:          00:11:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:03       In one more quick quote as you, you can, you can just Google Machiavelli and quotes and you'll find a bunch of great ones. Men rise from one ambition to another. First they seek to secure themselves against attack. Then they attack others and that's actually from the prince, which is his most famous book. And if you think about the process of being a human being, that right there is very accurate and you can really see that with accuracy. If you overlay that on Jujitsu, first you seek to is secure yourself from attack and then you attack others right when you're rolling at first, when you first start, you're just trying to defend, just trying not to get choked. Yeah. And then eventually you can stop from getting choked and you can stop from getting arm locked in and you start trying to attack those people in arm locked down.

Speaker 1:          00:11:50       So that's Machiavelli and a, if you don't know anything about them, he was an Italian, really a politician. And a diplomat. And, but on top of that, this was during the renaissance period and he's an actual renaissance man. So he was a poet. He was a poet, philosopher. He was a playwright. He was an author of books born in 1469 died in 1527 from 1503 to 1506 he was in charge of the Florentine militia. And when he was in charge of that militia, he didn't like mercenaries because he realized that weakness of mercenaries is that they, they're, they're getting paid. That's why they're fighting. They're not fighting be from their true belief system. So he raised and recruited a citizen army and they were well respected on the battlefield and they fought in some pretty good battles and one but it didn't last forever. Florentine was eventually defeated and dissolved, and Machiavelli was accused of conspiracy and tortured.

Speaker 1:          00:12:58       And I, of course, whenever I, I go down a lot of rabbit holes, but I went down that torture rabbit hole for a little while yesterday. And they were pretty brutal about it, but he, they thought he was a conspirator or whatever. And he did. He even after torture, they couldn't get it out of him. They eventually just exile them. And that's when he wrote his book the Prince, which I'm sure we'll cover on here at some point. This is where you are here. This is where the word machiavellian that's kind of, it usually refers to his book, the Prince and, and usually that word nowadays is used to describe someone that's kind of scheming and unscrupulous if like if you look it up in the dictionary, that's, it'll give you a definition along those lines. And like someone that's trying to snake and make things happen happen.

Speaker 1:          00:13:47       But, and like I said, I'm sure we'll cover that book at some point. But um, after that he wrote another book, which is called the art of war. And it's, it's definitely a really good book. It's Anna. We will probably parse through the entire thing at some point. But one thing that's good about it is in the end of the book, he part seven of the book and there's, we have this, the last, the last part of the book, he basically breaks out the most important principles from the book, which makes it pretty easy and straight forward to uh, talking to, uh, to explain them and, and then you can get the details. And I'm, like I said, I'm sure we'll get granular at some point on it, but here's what he says in this book, he's, and it's bare with me a little bit only because the, the translation is old.

Speaker 1:          00:14:47       I know that I've told you many things, which by yourself you might have understood and considered, not withstanding, I have done it as today. Also I've told you for to be able to show you better meaning thereof, the quality of this army and also to satisfy those if there be any whom have not had the same commodity, do understand them as you nor me thinks that there are other to tell you. Then certain general rules, the which you should all have most familiar, which bvs which is his way of saying lesson. I wrote a lot of stuff. I'm glad you understood it or at least you say you did, but just in case some other people can't understand it. I'm going to break it down for you very simply in these general rules and like I said, the translation, the translation that I read of this book is called the tutor translations by ag and it's translated by a guy named Peter Whitehorn in 1560 so we're talking like somewhat archaic language and it's a little bit tricky to get through bone. I'll talk through them and we'll get it into an understandable format and there we go. So like I said, he says, hey look, I wrote a lot of stuff. Here's the general rules that you should be most familiar with. Here we go. Number one, the same. That help if the enemy, her teeth, the and the same that help if the hadith the enemy. That one's pretty straightforward, right? What benefits the enemy harms you and what benefits you harms the enemy

Speaker 1:          00:16:27       straight forward. I think, you know, that's one of those common,

Speaker 4:          00:16:31       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:16:32       principles that across the ages everyone says it. And the reason they say that is because people forget it. People forget that if, if, if we're, if we can hurt the enemy in any way, it's helping us and anything we do that benefits also is going to hurt the enemy. Yeah. So sometimes we forget that that's why many of these various canons of principles on war remind us of that because it's an important fact. Number two, he that shall be in war most vigilant to observe the devices of the enemy and shall take most pain to exercise his army Shalon [inaudible] least perils and may hope most of victory.

Speaker 1:          00:17:23       So what does that mean? That means pay attention. That means be vigilant in observing the methods and plans of the enemy. And when you're in war, number one, pay attention to who you're fighting against. Understand who they are. Andy Burke, he was going to do and Ebi, I think it was an match. You know where he was going against yeah. Craig Jones. Yeah. You only thing about Craig Jones. Greg Jones is savage. Andy, you know, he's, he's awesome. But we're in a, we're up, we're training, we're training hard. He goes and competes against him and loses fast. Yeah. Why do you lose? He lost because Gwelf number one, cause Craig Jones is awesome and you know what Andy's real good at. He was good at all of Jujitsu, but he's got real good foot locks. Got Real good heel hooks. He likes to play that game. You know, it's training with me, trading with Dean list and so he's rolling in.

Speaker 1:          00:18:30       Didn't know much about Craig Jones. In fact, he didn't know anything about Craig Jones. Oh Dang. They just, Oh yeah, he's good. Whatever. Yeah. Not, not, not in a disrespectful way. But you ever heard somebody say, um, like when they say, Hey, w w what? What do you think about your opponents left hook or whatever. When they say, what do you think about your ponens ground and pound? And they say, I'm not worried about my opponent, it's what I'm going to do is not what they're going to do. You know what I mean? And I don't mean that in a bad way. I'm not trying to say Andy was cocky, but Andy, his thing was like, look God, you know I do Jujitsu. Yeah. That was his approach. Like I do Jujitsu and Hay and also there's a little bit of like, Hey, well you might go against this guy, but he might get her, you might have this or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:19:06       You know what I mean? So, right, right. And it was a tournament as well. So you can't really get focused on one guy. You're going to be fighting three or four guys and one night you just got to get your Jujitsu game up. Yeah. So Andy Rolls in and he goes, he went right into Craig Jones, his game in seconds. And, and the other thing was Andy super relaxed. Like, I mean he's, he's relaxed anyways, so he's like, oh, okay, this is, do you know, we're just going to do some Jujitsu and it'll escalate over time and eventually, you know, it's something we'll, you know, we'll get to that point and whatever and he goes in and boom and it goes right in to one a crack. Jane Craig Jones is like really good moves. Just goes right into it for him. And she know I was bombed then obviously Andy's bumped but didn't do any, you know, we me, I should have been like, hey man, let's look at your opponents.

Speaker 1:          00:20:02       Let's check out their game. Because if you just know, you know how it is. If you're aware of someone's game, you can definitely mitigate it. You can't defeat it. I'm not saying he could defeat Craig Jones, but he would've been, he wouldn't have fallen into that in a matter of seconds. He would have been, oh, this is his move there. I need, I know what to do to at least mitigate the first attack, the second attack. Right. If you don't do that, you're going to, you're going to have problems. And, and, and he got and then he came back and read that. He's like, he's like, yeah, that guy's good. So props to my board, Craig Jones, you beat my, my boy. Uh, hopefully you guys will meet again one day and you're going to, he'll get another go and he'll know your game a little bit better. But bottom line is study your opponents, study your opponents.

Speaker 1:          00:20:49       Now can you go too far with that? Yeah, you can. Yeah, because some people think, oh, I wish that happens sometimes when the UFC, someone will Ms. Wade or they'll get hurt and they'll throw a new opponent. Madam though wasn't ready for that guy had been training for a strike or now you're putting me up against grappler or whatever. Yeah. So you know, uh, Sarge, this is pretty cool. Sarge who was a really good, who was and is a really good wrestler and he's also Jujitsu now, but he was, he said when he would train for wrestling, you know, cause he was a high school restaurant. Poway, which if you know anything about wrestling and California, we're actually in America, you know, Poway high school has it like real dominant wrestling program. And he was a wrestler there as well as his brother. But he said when he would train, he would, he would picture someone with no face.

Speaker 1:          00:21:37       And it's because, you know, when you were in the high school wrestling scene out here in California, you know the people that you're gonna come up against, right? Tournament, you're going to come up against these six guys and you know that two of them are good or whatever, but he just say nope. And when he would look at him, he's like, when I would look at them before a match, I wouldn't even, I just see like a blur, just fog in their face. And then he said once he would knew he was going to go against that guy, then he'd look at him in a, calculate their face and be like, I'm gonna kill this guy.

Speaker 1:          00:22:07       But that's the why. What would it be? His point in that was he didn't want to get, uh, like his mind offset by, oh, it's not who I expected it to be. Right, right. So he wouldn't have any expectation on who was going to be, he was just going to get in the murder mode. And then when, when he finally realized that they're walking out of a map of then, then he'd look at their face and go, okay, this is the guy I'm going against and I'm gonna kill him. Which for Sarge, you know, that means the actual, so observe the methods and plans of your enemy. Absolutely. Next part of is you, you have to endure much hardship and training. Of course, you got to train hard. So observe your enemy, know what they're doing, and then train really, really hard and you're going to have a greater chance for victory. Of course, common sense. Next one. Number three, never conduct vie men to fight the field if first thou has not confirmed their minds and know it's them to be without fear and to be in good order for though for Thou oddest never to enterprise any dangerous thing with by soldiers. But when Thou seest that they hope to overcome.

Speaker 1:          00:23:29       So again, we're dealing with some middle English or I think you English, um, linguists, people can get at me if I'm wrong, but we're pretty close to middle English. Maybe it's a little late middle English, but we're in the ballpark. So what is he talking about there? Never lead your soldiers into an engagement unless you are assured of their courage. Mm hmm. And then he actually says, unless you know them to be without fear, which is a stretch in my mind, cause you're going to have people that are gonna be afraid. In fact, we, you can, you, you're gone. People are going to be afraid when they're going into combat. 90 something percent. A high percentage of people are going to have some level of fear, but you do need to make sure that they're going to be able to overcome that fear. So if you got people that are shaking in their shoes and they feel, you know, you think they're going to, they're not, they've not been tested at all, well then that could be a real problem.

Speaker 3:          00:24:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:23       Then, and then the question becomes, okay, well how do you test if someone's gonna be afraid or not? What do you think they do in the military?

Speaker 3:          00:24:29       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:24:30       with people. What do they do? Want to make them not scared? Yeah. Test their fear. How do you test her fear? Put them in scary situations, which is scary. Situations in training. Make them repel off the high tower, make them send to airborne school. Hey, airborne school, I would say, you know, of course there's, there's some level of some things that you need to learn in airborne school, but you're basically, I mean, you can literally throw a sack of potatoes out of an airplane with a parachute on it and it's going to land up pretty much. Okay. Most of the time, and that's what you do when you go to the school. You learn the proper exit procedures. When I went to airborne school, it's a Kz. Here's the extra procedures. Here is how you land. You're floating down. You don't have much control over your parachute.

Speaker 1:          00:25:14       So there's not a lot to learn. Technically. It's not like a major skillset. I mean it's a three, let me put it this way, it's a three week school, right? It's not like it's on a, it's not a long intensive school about learning how to pack parachutes or even how to maneuver yourself through the air because there's only so much you can do. Yeah. So what is it that's important about airborne school? What's important about airborne school as you're going to overcome the fear of jumping out of a damn airplane, that's important. That's why an airborne or you'll go go talk to the 82nd airborne division or the hundred first airborne division. Those guys are awesome and they have that little thing that they've all done that has put them, they've been screened out a little bit, cause some people are going to be afraid.

Speaker 1:          00:25:58       So yes, that's what you do. You make people do hard, scary things. I mean, in the seal teams it's the same thing. What do they do? You're going to learn how to parachute. Then you're gonna parachute at night. They're going to parachute at night into the water. Then you're going to jump out of a helicopter at night at, you know, 20 feet into the darkness and with a boat and you're gonna rig that thing up and you're gonna dive at night and you're going to swim at night in the open ocean or you're, or you're just going to go ghost. That scares some people off for some reason. It never really scared me. Yeah. I have no fear of sharks up. Let me rephrase that. I have no fear that a shark is randomly going to bite me. If I was in the water and there were sharks, I'd be scared.

Speaker 1:          00:26:36       Yes. And I know that there are sharks in the water so that your guys should be scared. But I dunno. I feel lucky. Yeah. I feel like sharks really want to eat me and that very much. They'd rather eat like someone like you. Well I guess if you're on a surf board, I guess that increases the chances from what I understand. Yeah. Cause you look like a seal, like a sea animal seal. So that's what you do. You put people in situations where they're going to be afraid. You know? And this is something that I think everyone should do. If you have a job that's going to cost stress, you want to put people in stressful situations. So that's how you test that fear. And again, you're not going to go to remove the fear from people. What you want to figure out is can they overcome the fear?

Speaker 1:          00:27:19       That's what you want to figure out. Um, what else he say no, that they're organized. Never make an attempt unless you, unless you see they hope for victory. So you got to convince, if you're telling your guys like, Hey, we're probably gonna lose you. Won't say that. You say, look, it's going to be hard, but there's a chance we can take this. And you know what I mean? You got to get them in that attitude, not the attitude of like, oh, we're just going to lose what's going on here for no reason. Don't let that happen. Number four, it is better to conquer the enemy with famine than with iron in the victory of which fortune may do more than Valliant ness.

Speaker 1:          00:28:04       That one's pretty self explanatory. It's better to defeat the enemy by hunger then steel, you know, it's better to let them starve. Then have to go and fight him and then he says, in such a victory, the fortune, like your luck counts more than Valeant ness, which is cool. Understandable. This is one of those things where you've heard me say before he, the best victories are the victories where the person doesn't even know that you're fighting them. That's the best victory. And then if you can, if you can maintain your ego after you win and you don't gloat, then they never even did it. Even register it, right? They didn't know they were. They didn't know they were in a fight. That's what you want. This is very similar, but this, this part, I'll throw a little back at it in such fortune, victory counts more than Valeant nus.

Speaker 1:          00:28:54       Yeah. Good fortune is going to help. But guess what? We're going to make our own luck, right? We're going to make our own luck. That's what we're gonna do. We're gonna and we're gonna make bad luck for the enemy. We're going to dry up rivers. We're going to damn river so they can't grow food. That's what we're going to do. So when it cut off supply chains, that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna make, we're gonna make fortune favor us. Number five, no purpose is better than that, which is hidden from the enemy until you've executed it. Boom. Pretty straightforward. No plan is better than that which you have concealed from the enemy until the time you execute it. No doubt.

Speaker 5:          00:29:43       True in life. True in business, true in Jujitsu. That's what the judge essentially the element of surprise, surprise. If you, if you, if your enemy doesn't know what you're gonna do and then you're done and they go, oh, that was a nice arm walk or wow, you really took over that market share and I didn't see it coming. If you don't see it coming, that's really it. We see it coming from a mile away. It's like, ah, yeah. You can still do that sometimes dean does that. Yeah, but we do. Yeah, we talked about that. What he does different things though. Like yeah, he, he'll like many, many steps. Yeah. He'll tie up your defenses while it's when you, when you see the incoming, he ties up all your defenses like as it gets close.

Speaker 5:          00:30:26       Number six to know in the war, how to understand occasion and to take it help if more than any other thing to know one war, how to understand occasion and take it help if more than any other thing. What does that mean? That means you, one of the best skills you can have is knowing how to recognize a good opportunity in war or in life and take advantage of that opportunity that is more beneficial than anything else. And you know, the biggest and most Blakeman example where you see this, well your kids aren't old enough, but with kids, just kids, kids have so much opportunity in life. Yeah. And they just don't take advantage of it. Like they should. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I could see how that can be for sure. But I think that's because they have life is connecting now and then the future.

Speaker 5:          00:31:23       You know, I guess that's the thing. Yeah. There's no doubt that they have, there's no doubt that they have that athletes. Yeah. Real good athletes. Same thing. They have all this potential. Yeah. Any time someone, well not anytime. Oftentimes somebody that are, some people that are given a gift, it's just given to them. They don't have to work for it. They don't want to take advantage of it. They don't see the opportunity. They don't take advantage of the opportunity or that skill set is, yeah. Cause. Yeah, almost like, um, you know, when you give a kid a gift verse or money versus if they earn it, I think you covered that in a way of the world kid. Yeah. That's, that's way covered on way of the warrior kid. When you earn it, it's like, you know, the hard work it takes and you kind of appreciate it and then whatever comes out of that. But yeah, if it's given to you, you just, you run the risk of squandering it for sure. Especially when the going gets rough, you know? No, no. Next nature breed. If few strong men, the industry and the exercise make with many,

Speaker 5:          00:32:37       what does that mean? That means, you know, nature makes very

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       few strong brave men, but hard work and training makes many boom. Yeah. That'll work for it. Yeah. You want people to be brave. You want people to be, uh, have courage. Make them strong, make them work hard. Yeah. That will absolutely increase their bravery. And remember that question we got asco a while ago about how do I make my unit guys in the military, military you, how do I make them proud? How do they increase their level of pride? Train hard. They will get physically stronger. They will get mentally stronger and from that they will start to take pride in themselves and pride in themselves as a unit. Eight discipline may do more in war than fury figured you'd like. Yeah, I kind of liked that one. Discipline counts more than fury in war. Discipline counts more than fury in life.

Speaker 1:          00:33:46       I'm not discounting emotions. I'm not doing that because you can't cause sometimes man, people's emotions they get, they will carry them through a really tough time period. That's why in discipline equals freedom. In the field manual, I talk about how you got to use both logic and you got to use emotions and when sometimes when emotionally it doesn't make any sense or you're going to break emotionally, you got to go with the logic of the situation that I got. I got to drive through this and vice versa. Sometimes the lodge cause like this makes no sense whatsoever. Turned to the emotional side. Yup. But discipline, he says may do more and he's right. It's not 100% is like discipline because if you have people that are just discipline, but they have no heart, they have no emotion. What I, how good are they? They're not that good.

Speaker 1:          00:34:29       Yeah, they're not, they're not as good as the person that has both. There's not as good as a person that has discipline and a little bit of fury. They can kind of get crazy when they need to button in MMA. You see this, you'll see someone when they're young and they'll lose some fights cause they'll, they'll sit someone down or whatever and then they'll just go crazy trying to catch them to get Connor triangle. Yeah. You have to maintain your discipline even during the, the actual battle. You have to maintain your discipline. You can't let the fury get ahold of you.

Speaker 5:          00:35:02       Yeah. Too much discipline, fury, discipline. Fear. Yeah. Once you watch the Cyborg fight, right. The reason why I had Amanda Nunez. Yes. So this is what it seemed like. He's fast, but this is what it's looked like where cyborg landed like a solid one and Amanda Nunez as a response unleashed fury, like some legit fury fury, but it was disciplined fury because when she started landing hard ones she didn't like overcome it. It was like really balance. You know, she looked great but there was some, there was a lot of fury. So fury like it wasn't like

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       all just spoken calculated like punches who was there was fury and Tim Kennedy, someone's like Ah, do UFC tweeted out like she's throwing haymakers and Tim Kennedy's like those aren't haymakers cause every single one of them hit, they were full punches from Amanda that we're nailing Cyborg right in the head. Yeah. Most of the time, like in five times in a row you don't, you don't normally see five punches land, especially not punches that are thrown with that much fury. He can kind of tell when like you see like their, their feet when they're throwing punches like you get, there's like a huge forward lean. If they, if they're haymakers there's like this huge Ford liens and they usually pressing forward like fully. But when they're like disciplined, there's like that you see, you can see the balance. Like they'll back up just a little bit. You know, it's good.

Speaker 1:          00:36:35       So good. Yeah. That was crazy. Discipline may do more then fury. So you know what, make sure you have some discipline it. All right. Next one. Number nine, when any depart from the enemy's side for to come to serve the, when they be faithful, they shall be unto thee. Always great gains for that power of the adversaries are more diminished with the loss of them that run away then bone of then those that be slain. Although that the name of a fugitive be to new friend suspected and old two odious, too old odious. So when he's talking about traders, there three is talking about, so when you say when any depart from the enemy side to come serve you. So when when people leave the enemy and they come to serve with you, they're going to be more loyal and they're great. They're great acquisition.

Speaker 1:          00:37:35       And actually he's saying that people that leave the enemy and come to your side are more powerful for you. Then people that, that you've killed and there they have more value. The, when they come aboard your team, they're going to be suspected. You know that the old, that your team is going to look at him with like a cautious eye and the team that they left are going to hate them. Yeah. They're going to hate them. That was weird when Solzhenitsyn was saying that when they would capture the Russian turncoat soldiers that were now fighting for the Nazis, as soon as they spoke any Russian, they'd kill him. That was, that was a pretty scary thought. So this is very accurate from that perspective. Yeah. Like if you're a trader, we're not even going to give you a chance. We're just going to kill you.

Speaker 1:          00:38:27       Yeah. Wait, so who, wait, who? So the Russians, the Russians didn't kill him. No. So there was a whole group of Russian soldiers, yeah. That turned against Stalin and turned against Russia and started fighting for the Nazis. Yeah. And so when the Russians would capture those, what they consider to be traders, as soon as they heard a soldier speaking Russian, they'd kill him. The Nazis, you mean they were, they were Russian soldiers fighting for the Nazis. Was it fossil? That was the guy's name. So there was a German or, sorry, a Russian general that was the leader of that whole group. The Vos alarmy I think was the name. Yeah. And so when the Russian Stalin's Russian actual red soldiers would capture these traders that were fighting against them, now they would, if they heard them speaking Russian, they'd kill him. Hmm. So this is

Speaker 5:          00:39:29       from that perspective. It's accurate. Yeah. I wonder why they're more valuable, you think? Because what cause or what, or loyal, he said loyal, right to, well, the,

Speaker 1:          00:39:41       the jerk, the Russian soldiers that were now fighting for the Nazis, they would fight to the death because they knew that they were dead anyway.

Speaker 5:          00:39:47       Right. That captured, yeah. Like if they got, yeah. So yeah, they were, they would fight even harder. Uh, the thing that I'm not sure about this is, well, I guess I agree with it. I do agree with it. When someone's a trader, you're suspect of them, right? You know, you're just, you're just like, Hey, are you get to your attorney or you're a trader, I'm suspect to you. So it's going to take a little time for me to actually trust that you really came to Mizade. But I guess like when you think about, just like how you said that, you know, they know they're dead anyway kind of thing where it's like, okay, let's say mean you were enemies, whatever. And one of my guys goes to you and says, Hey, I give up, I'll help you. I give up. You're like, okay, he gives up, I get it and let's see what he has to offer kind of thing.

Speaker 5:          00:40:31       But I suspect. Yeah, but your suspect, but let's say a guy in your team used to be on my team and I know that I'm pissed at that guy. And then he gives up now to me, to my guys like Mike, I see him or whatever and he's like, Hey, I give up. I'll help you. Oh No, no, no. You don't give up your debt. Yeah. So it's like that. Like how you see it, they know they're dead anyway. What the Russians did to the vasile soldiers. Yeah. So you, oh you traded. Okay, cool. You're dead. And that makes sense. Right? So that's probably why they have to be loyal because it's either loyalty or death, you know, they can't give up anymore. If I am not a trader, I can give up and get beat, pow be whatever I can, I can give up. I have that option trader who already made the trade, he doesn't have that option. That's why he's loyal. He has to be looking at a minimum. He's going to fight to the death. And it's interesting too that

Speaker 1:          00:41:22       traders are, you know, in the business world, because in the business world, you know, there's, everyone's always, recruiting is limited number of the human limits in the world and we can only get so many people that can do this job. And if you have skills in that job, you're getting recruited all the time. And so that's, that hurts when they leave. And that's why. And, and just to kind of close the loop on this, when they leave almost all the time, the reason, the reason that they're leaving is because of leadership or I should say lack of leadership inside their organization. So if you have a, if you have a problem hanging on to people in your organization, it's most likely a leadership problem. Not a comp problem, not a midlife crisis problem for the employee. It's a leadership problem. Hmm. Cause good, good people will stay with good leaders and if there's not good leaders, they're looking for another job, they're looking for another way, they're looking for another opportunity. Makes Sense. Leadership, leadership, leadership. Get some number 10 better. It is in pitching the field to reserve behind the first front aid enough then to make the front bigger to disperse the soldiers.

Speaker 2:          00:42:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42:53       What that's saying is it's better to keep your reserves just behind that to keep some reserves just behind the front lines rather than spread out your reserves and take on a bigger front trying to hold more area. It's editing, you know, this is prioritize and execute, right? Keep your, keep your focus of effort even with your reserves. Keep focus of effort, keep them consolidated so you can utilize them well. Next up, number 11 he is difficultly overcome, which can know his own power and the same of the enemy.

Speaker 1:          00:43:34       Okay, let's, that was almost like a a Yoda type. He is difficult to overcome. So what we're saying there is it's hard to overcome someone who knows how to recognize or knows and understands his own power and the power of the enemy. So does that mean know your strengths and weaknesses? Right. That's what it means. Yeah. Since he says that, right. Is this something about winning the deal? Definitely. Number 12, the Valliant ness of the soldiers available more than the multitude. Sometimes the situation help biff more than the valueless. Okay. So what we're talking about there is that the bravery of the soldiers is worth more than the number of soldiers you have.

Speaker 1:          00:44:23       Makes Sense. If you have brave, courageous soldiers, they can take a more, they can do a lot more than people were soldiers that are afraid. So you want brave soldiers and then it says the site, what does it say that sometimes the situation help if more than the voluminous. So even that, what trumps the courageous and what trumps the bravery is what's the, what's the terrain situation? You know, what's the environment that you're in? What are the rules of the game? One of the rules of the game that you're playing. Cause if you, if you know the rules, you're going to be in a a much better situation. The uh, this happens in Jujitsu, right? Yes. Because the rules are always a little bit different. There's no unified set of rules and Jujitsu. Yeah, there's some clothes, but there is no unified set of rules and sometimes someone will lose simply because they don't know the rules.

Speaker 1:          00:45:21       And then once you know the rules, you've got to train to the rules. Like Ebi, Ebi, you have those positions that you start up in. If you're an overtime, you start in spider web, you start on the back, right. If you don't, if you don't, if once you know those roles, then you've got to practice those positions so you can finish the emoc so you can finish from the back offer. You can escape from either one of those too. If you don't know that and you're gonna practice it. Because like for instance, I'm pretty good at finishing on our lock. Pretty good at finishing an arm lock. Sure. On the back I normally transitioned from the back to another position. So I would, if I was going in Ebi Tournament, I'd have to go and focus on what that rule set is and make sure I know how to win from that position. Yeah, yeah. Fully.

Speaker 6:          00:46:10       Yeah. Big One is the submission only versus points. So if people like let's say they spend 10 years competing with points in the tournaments, you know, then they go to submission only with the guy who is only trained in submission only he's going to, you know, going to have an added advantage. Yeah. In all of these different, yeah, different ways cause certain rules don't apply. Some do. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:46:35       Terrain Park, man Ed, this is, this is, it took me a while to understand this in my navy career, how important to reign is and now it's so obvious, but when you're maneuvering on the battlefield, if you know how to read terrain wealth, you have a complete advantage over the enemy. Complete advantage over the enemy. You should be paying attention to that terrain. Studying maps, looking at it and now they have all these you can, you can simulate the earth, right? It's a Google maps like a high speed. We can get down at eye level and you can walk the terrain and really understand what the visibility is like. That's the kind of, that's that's you should, you got to take advantage of those tools. You got to understand the terrain, you got to understand the terrain that you're going into in the business world. You'd go, got to go into a company understanding what the situation is there. When you get hired into a new, you want to know the terrain, you want to know who's got the clout. Yep. You want to know who the movers and shakers are. You want to know what things are off limits and whatever. Yeah. I don't know who's buying. Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:47:43       Like, you know how the, you know, people always say this is $1 billion industry, right? Like that kind of stuff. Like, Oh, you know, how's the, what's the need for a year

Speaker 1:          00:47:54       product? Um, remembering, because I watch shark tank, this is what they always ask. What was the, uh, was this a particular product?

Speaker 6:          00:48:01       No, no, no. Everyone, like pretty much, that's one of the things like they ask or they say, there'll be like, oh yeah, this is like a million house, you know, a million people own pets, you know, and all of these pets need this, you know, so, yes. And you see what I'm saying? So they kinda, they got another terrain in that way. Yeah, that's true. They don't know how many people have pets then. They don't know how many people going to buy that shampoo. You know, you gotta know that one dude shark tank. We maybe we should just do a leadership show about shark tank. What you've learned from shark tank. Sure. Next up,

Speaker 1:          00:48:35       number 13 new in sudden thing. Make armies afraid. Slow and accustom things be little regarded of them. Therefore make thy army practice and to know with small fights a new enemy before thou come to fight the field with him.

Speaker 4:          00:48:59       Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:49:00       middle English coming at you. So what, what is that? What it basically what we're saying here is a number one new and surprising things. Frightened armies. Hmm? The new and surprising things. Frightened people.

Speaker 1:          00:49:16       So on the opposing to that customary and expected things they can handle. So what do you do? How do you do? How do you, how do you properly mitigate that? Therefore you practice and you fight small engagements to get them experienced before you go to battle on the big battlefield with them, with the enemy. That's what you do. Train hard, don't dive right in. Get them used to the new technology. That's what you do. This is another good one with kids, right? You throw your kid into this scenario that they haven't been into before. You give him a little taste of it. Mm. Oh yeah. This is a, this is exposure therapy. Once again, I get asked on the warrior kid podcasts, I get asked every like every day I get at least one question from a kid that's I'm afraid of. What do I do?

Speaker 1:          00:50:14       And I, I usually wait two or three podcasts before I answer the same question again because it's kids. They got to get the reputation they've got to get the reps in. Yeah. But it's exposure therapy. You're afraid of something cool. Do a little of it. They do a little bit more and that's unknowingly what I did. And where the warrior kid one with him overcoming his fear of the water. I didn't know that that was a real thing. Not until Jordan peers. This is called exposure therapy. Yeah. I guess I need to talk like Kermit the frog to imitate Jordan busters, but he's like, yeah, that's exposure therapy. Yeah. Oh, okay. Next. Number 13 I'm going, I went on to number 14 she that with disorder follow with the enemy. After that he is broken. We'll do no other than to become of a conqueror. A loser. If you pursue a routed enemy in a disorganized manner, victory will be lost and you'll become a loser. Keep it under control. All the Amanda Nunez, right? Sure. She had the victory and the, you ever seen that? That one real quick clip and I forget who the fighter is. It did. It is the UFC. The guy takes a body shot and he keels over like he's about to like go down and the dude comes running in swinging. Yeah. The dude that's killed over like he's hurt just Barak. He wasn't hurt. He was just faking it.

Speaker 6:          00:51:43       Yeah. I think he was hurt talking about Scott. Yeah. Maybe he was hurt but he wasn't hurt as bad as he right cross functional. Apparently fairly cause he knocked the dude out. Yeah, it was the last thing is his nickname is Drago. I know that

Speaker 1:          00:51:58       it's interesting that that stuff doesn't happen more often. It's like trick football plays. Yeah. How come more trick football players don't happen

Speaker 6:          00:52:06       because they'd lose their trickery element of it. And sometimes there's a lot of risk involved. There's more risks than like a traditional play a lot of times. Yeah. Yeah. And it's like the, like the rope a dope. Remember that? The rope a dope. Oh yeah. Yeah. You essentially like act like you're kind of hurt or tired or whatever and then they punched himself out. They need get them, but yeah, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:52:28       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:52:29       yeah. You gotta be careful in that canned stuff. So when you do have your enemy on the run,

Speaker 2:          00:52:38       okay.

Speaker 6:          00:52:39       Don't go after him crazy. Okay. Keep it under control. Yeah. There is a play in football called the reverse. Right. And I thought that, cause you just said, why don't they run? No, I didn't play football. Yeah. And when you see that trick plays, yeah. Then you think, well that seemed to work pretty good. Why don't they do that stuff more often? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So here's the common trick play, right? The um, the quarterback does this, so sweep right through. They got to the running back there, runs the outside and then the running back, oh, he stops before he reached the lightest scrimmage. He stops and he throws the football not to a receiver, but to the quarterback who ran a route on the other side of the field. And cause no one's going to cover the quarterback. He's not a receipt Reno. And that was wide open to pass.

Speaker 6:          00:53:22       Oh, he's wide open. So called, ah, we called it passed back to the quarterback. So good. Like 38 sweet pass back to the quote. Okay. But I can see where there's risk in that one. Yes, because that's the running back back. So he got to nail that throw, which is really hard for running back typically. But I'd say the, the one that would always work is in pop Warner anyway. It would always work is the reverse. It's essentially like you do a sweet, everyone's running this way to block for this writing back everyone except for the one tight end or the why do you see where water of who's coming this way and the running back hands it off to him going this way. So he's full speed running this way. So everyone has to change direction to chase him. And usually that set of fields wide open, um, it works way better in pop Warner and younger teams because they don't know like these, these situations. Like they don't know. They just see everyone running there and they're just sort of go, you know, more than a professional. They're going to be like, wait, I shouldn't just be, you know. Um, but that was one I was like, why don't we just always run the reverse? Because every time this is this team that we played against, they'd always run it. And it always will.

Speaker 1:          00:54:26       I understand why. If you ran it every time, well then, then the regular reverse or what are the regular play would become the surprise. But it seems like, it seems like you could keep people guessing a little bit more. Those trick plays always see, I was looking at him going how I was pretty creative and

Speaker 6:          00:54:41       pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. I think you see it like, oh, kind of like I said, like when you go up in, um, like skill, like you can go on to the pros or whatever. Trick plays don't work is good. They have to be really advanced trick plays. That's when you,

Speaker 1:          00:54:56       have you ever seen like the trick play that like where

Speaker 6:          00:55:00       day, like almost walk off the field? Yeah. And then they like walk over like there's something wrong with the ball or something like stand up and they'll be like, no, something's wrong. And they will and then they just start running. Yeah. Yeah. So even that, and then those can backfire too because there'll be like, if all it takes is one defensive person to know that hey, that ball is in play right now. So they can just sort of walk over and hit it out of the hand, grab it from whatever they want because no one's blocking them. You know, no one's like everyone. It's Kinda, it's just risky check and get more people doing that. They're going to be like, oh, they're hip to it and it would never work after

Speaker 1:          00:55:33       awhile. Um, number 15, he did prepare if not necessary victuals to live upon is overcome without iron. So, um, whoever does not prepare food and provisions necessary to live is going to be overcome without any weapons at all. So what does that mean? Take care of your people, take care of, make sure you take care of your logistics. Logistics wins, wars and people need to survive. So do that. Number 16, he, that trusteth more in horseman than in footmen or more in footmen than in horseman must accommodate himself with the situation. So in the ancient times you had cavalry on horses and you had the infantry men on the feet and he's saying if you prefer one over the other, then you have to put yourself in the right situation where it's advantageous. Yeah. So that's why it's good to be well balanced and not really prefer one over the other. But if you do, then put yourself in a situation that's most advantageous to your style or preference of fighting. Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:56:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:48       Make sure you learn how to wrestle because if you don't know how to wrestle, someone else is going to dictate to you where that fight is going to go. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:56:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:58       17 when vow. Right? See if in the day there be coming any spy into the camp because every man to go into his lodge.

Speaker 2:          00:57:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:57:16       Okay, so what we're saying is this pretty straight forward basic headcount or if you want to see if there's a spine of the camp average, send everyone to their place. You know, get a head count. No big deal. 18 change purpose. Windau perceives that the enemy half foreseen it.

Speaker 2:          00:57:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:33       Does that mean if you, if you think the enemy or if you perceive that the enemy knows what you're doing, didn't change your plan, that's, that's what that means. Pretty straight forward. Now where we don't do that or the reason, most of the time we don't do that is because our ego, we got our plan and we're going to stick to it. Now this is a total, this is why leadership is hard because there's a point where your plan, you got your plan, and if you stick to your plan, you can, it's going to work, right? And then there's a point where you could stick in your plan. You're sticking with the plan and it's going to fail because it's not working. So as a leader, this of the hardest thing to do as leaders to recognize, like you know what? The plan that I came up with, it's not going to be perfect, but it's still going to work and where to go with it.

Speaker 1:          00:58:20       Because to try and change the plan halfway through is really hard to do. Even if you were hearse, the contingencies. Now, if you are the contingencies properly, you're probably gonna be ale to execute your new plan pretty easily. But if you didn't, it's going to be a problem. So this is one of the hardest things for a leader to do, is to pay enough attention and then weigh the risk versus reward. Because if you're coming up with a, if you have your plan and you're executing the plan and all of a sudden something changes, not quite what you thought and you decide you're going to try and do something completely different, what your changes that you make on the fly are going to cause as much confusion as what the enemy's doing. And it's going to be a real problem. However, like this says, if the enemy sees what you're doing and now the reacting to it in a proper way and your plan is no longer effective, you have to be able to, you have to be able to comprehend that and discern whether you should change or not. And that's one of the hardest things for Lee, uh, hardest decisions for a leader to make as it's happening. What's worse than that is we have a long of time when you start talking

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       about strategic plans, this is where ego gets more involved. Because when I have this plan and this is what we're going to do and I'm just going to stick with it, and if it's not working, I'm going to do it harder. So that's what you want to watch out for. You know, there's like some of these, um, companies being taken down by online companies, right? You got to have change your game plan. You know, you got to adjust. You've got to look at them and say, okay, what are they doing? Where are they going? We know blockbuster. Like, like I've said this before, blockbuster could have, could have completely dominated Netflix, but what did they do? Nope, we're just over here. Hey, people are going to keep coming to our stores. Yeah. You know, there's a certain feeling that you get when you come into a store and you get to look at on browse with the movies.

Speaker 5:          01:00:08       It's something exciting to get to pick up popcorn where you can to get popcorn at your house. You know, people are gonna want to keep coming in to these stores, right? No, actually they're not. They already have popcorn at their house. Amazon delivered it yesterday in an hour, by the way up and then your terrain to an Allen. And yet they had all the relationships with the movie places. What are those movie companies called? [inaudible] of the production companies. What is it like? What's Warner brothers? What does that production studio. They had studio, they got the relationships with the studios. They could've been like, hey, we're gonna start selling this stuff online, and they would have said, well, that doesn't make any sense because the, it's going to be all jumbled up when it gets downloaded. Yeah, but it's going to get better. We're just playing the long game.

Speaker 5:          01:00:49       Yeah. It's weird that blind said they were thinking, you know, it's too hard to download a movie on the Internet is going to be jumbled up. There's going to be buffering. No one even knew what Bob did. Netflix and event buffering. Buffering is just the Internet situation. Yeah. When it has to catch up. Do you remember five years ago there was buffering on all kinds of stuff. Now there's hardly any buffering. Barely any buffering. I've met my littlest daughter doesn't even know what buffering is using. They're just streaming. I'm sure she knows what it is, but she has never witnessed it. Yeah. Well then again, you know, you get bad service somewhere, get some buffering. They weren't wrong. They, I mean, they were on blockbuster, but they just, the whole idea of like, people like coming into blockbuster and browsing the movies and buying the thing is, that's true.

Speaker 5:          01:01:35       Like we did like doing that. Yeah. But it's because we didn't have a better option. You know, like when you go, like even going to the store sometimes it's kind of cool and fun, you know, sometimes. But most of the time at the end of the day, I'd rather press a button and go to the store. I'd rather press a button to every single time. Yeah. And there's also that thing where you, you're, it's a positive feedback loop, right? It's an echo chamber. I liked going on, you know, two of those people in the, in the c suite of blockbuster and account and you know, my wife loves going down and picking out a new movie with the kids and they love doing that, you know? And this was like, yeah. You know, my kids love that too. So, and my teenage daughter likes doing it too with her friends. And like you said, that's cause there's no other option. Your teenage daughter would be rather be in a room alone in her room clicking the next Netflix

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       movie. Yep. Popping their popcorn that got delivered earlier. Yeah. So if you, if you are on a strategy and it's not working, you got to recognize that you need to change it no to self everyone in the leadership position. Pay attention to that one. Next up. Number 20 soldiers when they abide at home, are maintained with fear and punishment after when they are led to the war with hope and with reward. What's it saying is when soldiers are confined to their quarters, they're kept there by fear and punishment. When they're led to war, they're led by hope and reward. You know, fear for me is just not a good tool for a leader to use period. I'm not saying you never, this is, I'm not saying you should never use it, right. There should be some element, a little element of fear. Right. And does the element of fear, right.

Speaker 1:          01:03:17       Let me ask you this. Do your kids have any fear of you at all? Cause you seem real nice. Uh, the, they do. Yeah. There's, there's just enough, a healthy element. Yeah. I mean, I would say a healthy, but I dunno. I don't really know what the standard of healthy fear levels are. But yeah, we agree that there is a healthy level of fear. Even with your kids. Your kids shouldn't just think that, that there's going to be no repercussions for anything that they do. Yeah. Your troops should also feel a healthy level of fear. And it's hard to even use that word because that word is so negative. Yeah. But there should at least be a level of like, you know what, we want to do that. No, there's a line with Jocko and you don't want to cross. It does align with Dad Echo and he seems real nice and all cruisy.

Speaker 1:          01:04:10       I think I am a little bit too cruisey though. So sometimes you do have to make sure people understand that if they cross the line, there's going to be a problem. And my kids definitely understand if they cross the line, just gonna be a problem. Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah. It's a real product. Doesn't surprise me and it keeps them in check. Yeah. Next Up, 20 and I'm pretty lenient. I'm pretty cruisy. You're actually surprisingly Cruzee and lenient. Everyone thinks I want to be the Great Santini. You probably never seen that movie. Yeah, but you don't want to raise your kids like that. Who was the girl? You don't want to be all militant and impose discipline on your kids and make them number one reliant on your discipline instead of their discipline. I don't want to, you don't want anyone like that. You don't want your team to be like that where they're reliant on you barking at them to tell him what to do. You don't want that, then they can't function for themselves. You don't want your kids to be that way either. When your kids to think, you know what, I need to make a good decision. I could slack off or I could do what I'm supposed to do. I'm going to do what I'm supposed to do because I know

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       it's gonna be beneficial in the end as opposed to I'm gonna do what I'm supposed to do only because I'm afraid that my dad's gonna yell at me or ground me or take away my computer or smashed one of my favorite toys. Yeah. Yeah. You don't, you, I mean the, the assumption, I think anyway would be that you're like more drill sergeant. I'm not even drill sergeant. I'm never, I know you're not, but I think it's like when you look at you or maybe what he just said, like one or two sound bites and you're like, oh, he's Joseph. There's recordings, many recordings of when I used to debrief seal platoons and I'm going to try and get some of those. And what is it? They're just, well, it's, it's definitely, I could see it's not drill sergeant. He, yeah, but it's definitely direct and can be pretty harsh.

Speaker 5:          01:06:06       Yeah. At the time. So like that's what I understand people would probably, but, but that was usually, it only be that way if somebody really did something egregious because most of the time he'd be like, Hey, what do you think? What do you, what were you thinking about over here? Debrief me on that. You know what I mean? So yeah. And it's all contextual to like, you know, I guess it's kind of natural. Like let's say I heard that right. I didn't really know you or nothing and I heard that and be like, okay, he's real direct and real, real strict in like all this stuff. So it's just natural to be like, oh cause he's that Kinda guy, you know, rather than kind of understand the nuance like okay, he's talking to these people the time. Yeah. And then versus, but then again, then that opens it up.

Speaker 5:          01:06:42       Who knows that and how that you'd be, so you just eat. Mine just sort of wants to just attach what they have witnessed, you know, to everything. Yeah. Well even drill instructors aren't like drill instructors. Yeah. I mean it's a, it's a training methodology. Yeah. There's see purpose for the Mac that way. See, and you know that because you've been around that type of leader isn't, doesn't function, that type of leader is not good. That type of person isn't going to function within the team. Yeah. So you can't, you just can't be that way. Is there a level of intensity? Sure. Do I bring a level of intensity sometimes? Yes. Absolutely. Yes sir. But that's not the way to go through life. Imposing discipline and fear into your team. You'll end up with either one of two things, a broken team that relies on you for their discipline or a team that mutinies against you and comes up and kills you. Yeah. Frags you in the, as they did in the nom. Alright, next number 21 good captains. Common never to fight the field except necessity. Constrain them and occasion call them.

Speaker 3:          01:08:02       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:08:03       So what that's saying is good. You know, good captains, good leaders, never enter into the engagement unless it's completely necessary.

Speaker 3:          01:08:12       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:08:13       That's it. That's a great point. And this is one of those things where

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       if you're in a leadership position, you shouldn't be doing the, you shouldn't be shooting your gun at the enemy. You should be observing your team shooting the gun and looking to see where the enemy's maneuvering to. Yeah. This is, uh, this is about detachment right here. Yeah. Don't get in the mix. Stay detached, decentralized command. Let the team maneuver, let them understand what the commander's intent is and let them maneuver towards victory. You stay back a little bit and monitor, go dive in in there. Does that apply to, cause you're the one who kind of said this example to me one time, I forget if it was on here or not, but you were like, um, it was about you when your kids tying their shoes, you know, let's say like, I don't know, you're late for school or we're running late or whatever and they're having a hard time tying the shoes.

Speaker 1:          01:09:03       Yeah. You're like, let them tie the shoes. Don't jump in and be like, oh, I'll do it. You know, kind of, I did say that and I've said it a bunch of times. That's a real simple example that's a little bit more towards the last question to or towards the last discussion that we just got into them and if you let your, if you tie your shoes for your kids all the time, they don't know what amount of time. Yeah, and furthermore, you literally are taking away their opportunity to learn some fine motor skills at that moment. This is not the same as that. This is, this is on a broader perspective. Your team is doing, your team is in a firefight and you pick up your gun, you go on the front line and you start shooting at the enemy. Well now who's leading right now?

Speaker 1:          01:09:38       I'm just looking around. This is the same as you know, you're in a business situation and your team is trying to come up with a plan and they're arguing amongst themselves and you jump in there and start arguing too. Now you don't have a good perception of, you should be just standing back listening to the various arguments take place. And I'm not talking about arguments where people are yelling and screaming. I'm talking about uh, a discussion where they're arguing different possible courses of action. If you dive right into those and you start becoming involved at point blank range, you lose all your perspective. So instead you step back and you don't, you don't, you don't go into the field. Yeah, you don't dive into the argument. You step back and you watch the fight unfold. And then as the fight unfolds, you see the best options because you're at altitude and you're not at point blank range.

Speaker 1:          01:10:27       One foot from the enemy fire. Yeah. This is just detached, decentralized command. Next up 22 cause that enemies caused that the enemy's no, not how thou right order vie army to fight. And in what? Soever manner. That vow ordained stint. Make that the first band be received of the second and the third middle English. Get something. What are we talking about here? Well, cause your enemies no knots. That means you don't want your enemies to understand how you're going to organize your, your army to fight. That's what this is. You want to confuse you mean you don't want them to know exactly what you're gonna do. And then the second part, make it make that the first band may be received. The second and third, I'm pretty sure I'm not a hundred percent sure, but I'm pretty sure that that's just talking about mutually supporting positions. So you want to set your team up so that they can support each other.

Speaker 1:          01:11:32       So confuse the enemy. Don't give up the plan and set your teams up so they can help each other. Once your tea, once a team is alone and unsupportable there alone. Mm. Try not to let that happen. 23 in the fight. Never occupy a battle to any other thing. Then to the same four which thou hast appointed it, if thou will, to make no disorder. It's a good day. It's modern English appreciation. Well, it makes it hard too. They spell even words that, you know, they spell them all day. And just so you know, you're looking at this, I actually tightened up some of the spelling and made some of the spelling more modern because I just couldn't, it was harder to track man. It's hard to attract. Again, this, this thing was interpreted from Italian in 1560 by Joe was it George White head was getting after the translation. Yeah. So um, it just, it's, it's interesting and this is the same thing. You know I said that when we did Shakespeare don't need to do more Shakespeare, but people think, oh I should just understand Shakespeare, you're not going to understand stage. It's almost a different language. So you need to actually break it down like we're doing with these various statements.

Speaker 1:          01:12:54       So what this one is saying is don't use a company, don't use a, don't use it a unit for a purpose other than what you've assigned it. Unless you want to cause disorder, unless you want to cause chaos. So you got your team, they're assigned to do this. Let them do that. Now, obviously that can be problematic. And so we need to mitigate that because there's times when team is going to have to do something that you don't want it to do. And so I'll give you a little example. When you're doing an assault on a target, you have two elements, the base element and the maneuver element. The base element is going to stay in position. They're going to sneak up on the target and then the maneuver elements going to sneak over to the flank. And then the base elements going to start firing.

Speaker 1:          01:13:52       Massive firepower at the target. And then the maneuver element after a little bit, we'll stand up and start to go through the target. They shift fire off the target and then you clear the target. So when I was a young gun jury, so we would, we would, you know like let's do this. Yeah. So we're going to hit this target, we're going to do a fire and maneuver on this target base and maneuver. So what we would do is say, okay, let's take all of our heavy machine guns and put them in the base element. And then the guys with the little pea shooters, the little m 16 shooters, all those guys will be on the assault because they're light and they'll be able to maneuver really quickly through the get to the target and then go through the target. Makes perfect sense. And I remember the first time I presented this type of plan to one of the old guys from nom, he's like, no, don't do that.

Speaker 1:          01:14:46       Why not master chief? This way we have more firepower in our base and our maneuver guys can maneuver more quickly. Here's the problem. When that maneuver element is going towards the target, what happens if they get compromised and contacted? And now they're that? They're the ones that have to lay down their base. They can't get up and move because they're being shot at. So guess who has to move? The base element has to move and they can't move very well if they're only getting a cover fire from little pea shooters. So you keep your integrity of your squads and you utilize them that way and it's like, oh, so what you want to do in this situation is you want to make sure that your elements can, are capable of doing each other's jobs, maybe not to the fullest extent, but they at least need to be somewhat capable.

Speaker 1:          01:15:34       So maybe you put one machine gun and the expected one extra machine gun and the expected base element and now you only have a couple of machine guns in the maneuver element, but you got him if you need them. So I don't 100% agree with that. That being said, you definitely want to let people do the job that they were signed to do. Make sense? Right? You've trained them, you've assigned it, let's, let's try and keep the plan as it's supposed to be. Yeah. To the best of our ability, but we're thinking we're not black and white here. Leadership is not easy. Um, uh, you know, another thing is when you establish your teams, you try and use those teams for everything. If you can't, and again this is a dichotomy because as much as you want to keep your teams together, you also have to train them to be split up and broken up and combined and mismatched all together.

Speaker 1:          01:16:30       And I would always do this with all my fire teams. So the fire teams would stick together as much as humanly possible. But guess what? I would also train them that if they were all scrambled up, someone would step up, take lead and that'd be a new fire team and we'd start making stuff happen next up 24 the, so dean accidents with difficulty are remedied. Those that are thought upon with faculty. I had to look up. So Dean, cause I couldn't even get a clue on what that one was, but it's some sort of leader or a ruler. It's actually a ruler. And this is, this is a, this is a, so he's saying the soda in accidents, the leadership accidents with difficulty are remedied, are hard to fix. When leadership screws up, it's hard to fix. Those that are fought a pound are with difficulty, are remedied if you use your head quickly. So yeah, there's going to be leadership problems and they're hard to fix unless you think and think quickly.

Speaker 1:          01:17:45       How do you, how can you improve your speed of thinking? Do you know how you can do that? Practice. Practice? So let's say get experience to ray cause experience gives you the practice. Yeah, it's experience. If I've seen something before, it's, I'm going to know a thousand times faster how I'm gonna react to it. Yeah. If I haven't seen it before I did. It takes me a while just to comprehend what's in front of my face. Yeah. So that's why when we train, we train to throw things. Okay. So first of all, when we train, we want to throw things at people that, different scenarios, different things happening, where they start to get pattern recognition. Oh, I've seen this type of thing before. On top of that, you also want to train people what to do or how to react when they've never seen it before.

Speaker 1:          01:18:42       Never seen anything like this before. Because if I show you, let's say I'm training you for, well I guess we might as well just use a Jujitsu tournament, right? Did, you did too. I'm training you for Jujitsu situ situations, right? I teach you how to defend this and I teach you how to defend that and I teach you how to defend this and I teach you how to defend that, right? And she's Yada Fan, 10 different things and you get pretty good at it. I also have to teach you a broad concept of what to do when there's something that you don't recognize. So hey, if the guy grabs your arm, I want you to pull your arm here. Hey, if the guys starts to go for your neck, I want you to swim your arm, your hand underneath, and Tuck your chin. If the guy starts pulling towards your back, I want you to shift your leg up and so he can't move around there.

Speaker 1:          01:19:25       So I'm going to give you exact steps to execute. If you see these things, and then I'm going to say this, if he's doing something you don't recognize, here's what I want you to do. I want you to Tuck your elbows in. I want you to posture and I want you to control his hips. Oh, okay. And then you'll start to be able to recognize what's going on. At least you're going to survive. I want you to detach and step back and say, what's he attack? Same thing with combat. I'm going to train you like, Hey, if he does this, you do that. If he does that, you do this. If you have no idea what's happening, here's what I want you to do.

Speaker 1:          01:20:05       Get into a 360 degree perimeter. Listen, right? I mean, whatever that that situation's gonna call for. If you don't know what's happening, like if I don't know where I'm getting flanked from or if I don't know where I'm getting shot at from, hey, everyone, take a knee, get cover. Don't just start shooting because that's going to cause confusion. It's also going to give away our position. Yeah. So we're going to do, when a go into a 360 degree perimeter, we're going to hold what we got. We're going to listen. That's our, that's our, that's our, if we don't recognize what's happening, that's what we knew. So we have standard operating procedures for things that we recognize and we actually also have something to do if we don't recognize we have a procedure for nonrecognition which is, which is important. It's kind of like, I mean it's different I guess, but it kind of maybe fits in with, you know, help people say expect the unexpected kind of thing. So it kind of fits in this, you're essentially trained for unexpected stuff. Like I would say, I would say go one. Yes. That's the important part is not just expect the unexpected. It's have a protocol for when something unexpected happens. Here's what we're going to do. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:21:12       Cause a lot of times when something unexpected, and I'm thinking, do you use to two right now? It's because that's on purpose. You know, like these guys with these weird games, this weird tall, flexible guys or something like that. They have these weird games and they'll do stuff that they know or they kind of rely upon. You not have seen it before, like you didn't see before. So they can capitalize when you start to panic, you know, or when you can, you know, if, let's say your arm is out here, like, um, like there's some leg locks that, that, uh, require you to kind of try to spin out of it and then they'll catch you with something else. Right. It's kind of that, so if you have a protocol that's just like, I don't know, whatever the protocol is, safety protocol, you know, it not only keeps you safe just statistically speaking, you know, chances are it'll keep you safe, but it'll jam up their game. Yeah. Overall, you know, especially these people that, that they, they, they capitalize on you panicking and not,

Speaker 1:          01:22:07       yeah. Do you want to have some kind of a reset position? And I used to use this with fighters. Like, Hey, here's your reset position. Like, just get to hear, cause you're comfortable there. Get them under control, control their hips, whatever. Combat. Same thing. Oh, you're, you're, you're, everyone's confused. Everyone's mixed up. Guys are all over the place. Let's get to a reset position in a building and now everyone knows where we are. We get a control of results. Business. Same thing we got. We got scenario that we don't know what's happening. You know what general corridors like, Hey, we're all going to go to our normal positions. We're going to stand by cause we don't know what's happening, right? So you've got to have not just to expect the unexpected, you've got to have a protocol to follow when something is occurring that you don't understand yet. Some kind of a reset position. Put that in your world. Next up, number 25 men, iron, money and bread be the strength of the war. But of these four, the first to be most necessary because men and iron find money and bread, but money and bread. Find not men and iron. Yeah, that one's pretty, pretty cool. Pretty self explanatory. Now let me, let's go to a business perspective here. A business perspective here, because this is a, this can help people make decisions in the business world. When you're going to make expand expenditures, when you are going to invest in something in your company,

Speaker 1:          01:23:46       it is important to assess whether or not you are investing in something that is going to help you build is going to help you grow. Or if you're investing in something that is not. So for instance, let's say let's say hey are are we could either take you know, $50,000 and remodel our current office or we can take $50,000 and we can rent this new sub office in an area that we don't have any, um, presence in. So which one is a better investment? Like we don't really need that remodel of our office. This other thing is going to help us actually grow. So make sure that the investments that you're making, the first thing you want to invest in his men and iron, right? You don't want to invest in money and bread, money and Brad's going to be gone. Yeah. And it doesn't reproduce. It doesn't reproduce itself. Whereas men and steel is going to get you more of that bread and iron in the long run. Or sorry. Bread and money.

Speaker 2:          01:24:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:24:54       All right. Number 26

Speaker 2:          01:24:58       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:24:58       The unarmed rich man is a booty to the poor soldier. What does that mean? It means that the unarmed Richman is the prize of, of course, ultra. That sort of means it means, it means be armed and this is the last one. Number 27 a costume vice soldiers to despise delicate living and luxurious apparel. I liked that one. Mm hmm. What does that mean? Get your people. Get your soldiers to despise delicate living. Despise Comfort, despise luxurious clothing. That's what I'm talking about. They'll be better soldiers. They'll be better people. Understand you feel like I'm talking to you right now. What the Connoisseur of comfort, comfort is in my firing line right now. Yeah, I dig it, man. I think obviously I can't disagree with that because Dang me.

Speaker 5:          01:26:03       Yeah. When you've been uncomfortable for an extended period of time, does it not make you a better person? A little bit. Yeah, it does. There we go. Yeah. You know the whole idea of be comfortable. You've told me the story of you, because I know it doesn't rain a lot here, but you used your kettle bells in the rain and the other day you told me that story two times, two days in a row now. Sure. Right? Yes. Yeah. Today you told me that even jade, your brother came out and was impressed by your determination commitment. So what is it, what is it about that that made you feel compelled to tell me about it? And B, you know, for lack of a better word, pretty damn proud that you went out in the rain and did a kettle bell workout and the cold. Uh, yes. Well, yeah, it's Straw it. And how did you feel inside strong when it was over? It felt better. Yeah. This is it. Well, yeah, it makes it stronger. I'm asking you real questions right now. It might seem like I'm joking, but it's actually real. You know why? Because this is a little step for you. And there's other people that are listening that would benefit from hearing how taking this little step away from comfort really, truly made you mentally and physically better. Go Echo Charles.

Speaker 6:          01:27:19       Well, the, wow, what can I start on that one? Okay. So, okay. Yes. I go outside out of workout planned. It's raining, raining kind of hard too, by the way. And it's kind of cold. The kind you got to wear like a lot of clothes, you know? So yes, I go ahead and do the whole workout hard too. And yes, my brother was like, Dang, that's some dedication and whatever. But yes, the, so the feeling is yeah, that I'm actually strong now. You know, it's like basically when you, when you break it down, it's like now you're strong, you're not weak. So weak would be like, just the littlest thing will throw you off your plan. You know, the littlest thing because you can't because you're so used to comfort where you're still used to like the clothing thing. I mean, yeah, that's kind of weird too. Like if you always gotta be wearing nice clothes, otherwise like you're kind of, you don't go out or something. I Dunno, but it's Kinda the say seems like the same concept. But yeah, if you can endure that stuff

Speaker 5:          01:28:15       and then how do you feel when you're done better? Yeah. Did you feel better after a workout in the cold rain where you went and got after it then you would have had it been just normal 70 degrees and sunny. So cow.

Speaker 6:          01:28:27       Yeah, a little bit, but I feel like, um, it's, it was just more of a psychological thing, which does help big time because now you know that rain, you just proved to yourself that rain, cold, whatever, is not an excuse.

Speaker 5:          01:28:43       How old are you for two years? Rain and cold as an excuse. No more, no more. Well, here's the thing, going to battle. You know, it's funny. Here's a good, here's a good expression. You used to saying that derives peregrine occurred when it was raining and cold. You know, we'd say good weather, but it was like a, it was kind of, it's true. It's definitely true because when it's raining and when it's cold, guess what? The people that are, you know on watch your enemy, guess what they're doing there. They're hiding. They're all bundled up and warm, so that makes it easier for you. Plus there's noise from the rain, which camouflage is the noise that you're making walking through the j or the woods or whatever. But that's always a good one. Whenever it's, whenever it's crappy weather. I was, I was say to myself, good operating whether kind of smile, but we used to say two genders, that's like, you can't complain about it.

Speaker 5:          01:29:41       You just look at your buddy. It's like when you, when the door of the t of the Hilo truck, you know to Hilo truck is no, back in the day we didn't have a lot of money for budget and so we'd pretend that we were in helicopters and we'd be in the back of big trucks and they just drive out in the middle of the desert or open up the Hilo truck and open it up, open up the door, and we jump out. Like we just got out of a helicopter, right? Little did we know that when the war actually came, we would be using vehicles. We used vehicles all the time. We, Bree, I rarely, rarely used helicopters in Iraq and Afghanistan. They used helicopters a lot more, but for me and Iraq, foot patrol and he load trucks, but we didn't have to call them Hilo trucks anymore.

Speaker 5:          01:30:24       Now we just called them trucks. Sure, sure. But when you're in a Hilo truck in 1994 and you get driven up into the wherever and that door of the Hilo truck opens out, opens up and it's raining and it's cold. And as you're getting out of the truck, your last moment to communicate out loud to everyone, you hear someone go good operating other and you're like, yeah, it is. This is going to suck. Yeah. And it makes sense. So like, yeah, if you're used to being uncomfortable or if you like despise comfort, however you put it, it's not me. They, Machiavelli said despise comfort, despising comfort. Essentially. You're getting comfortable with being uncomfortable. You know how they say that, right? They do. They do. Man. So yeah, that's what they're doing. So that's why, yeah. Yeah. Just improve it basically at the end of the day improves your chances of success, you know, may, uh, roadblocks of discomfort come about in the future. That's what happened. Indeed. And I, I think that not only will the rejection of comfort make better soldiers, it'll make better people. So yes, as you said, get out of your comfort zone, impose discipline and discomfort on yourself and you will become a better person.

Speaker 5:          01:31:53       And that wraps up Machiavelli for now. But Echo, speaking of, I'm getting out of our comfort zone and this is going to be a little dichotomy here, but getting out of our comfort zone to become better, what recommendations do you have for us to make that happen? Like I said, there's gonna be a dichotomy here. Okay. Cause what do we have? Well, well, there's a lot of things you have, but, but yes, so, uh, being the connoisseur of comfort. And so you're kind of the kind of of discomfort really, in a way. I don't know about that. Here's the thing though, I don't think about it much though. You know what I mean? I'd have to be like actively thinking about it. Discomfort, just about anything. I'm just over here doing what I'm doing. They know what I mean with discomfort, just capability. I don't care. I don't care. There's that old viking saying he's like the rain is cold and old. Viking says, how can the rain be cold?

Speaker 5:          01:32:56       Right. The rain's not cold. Yeah, but I don't know. I don't get it. How can the rain be cold if it's cold, Ben? It's cold. No, it's cold to you when it hits you. The rain itself hasn't called. That's a play on words. Little plan word. That's another good thing to think yourself. Another good thing do you think to yourself, you only get wet once. Yeah, I've talked about that before. Yeah, you, you're waiting to go across the river. You're looking for the best spot. You're like, oh nope. Just get wet. You only get one at one time. Once you're wet, you're wet. It doesn't matter if it's true, so like suck it up. The comfort thing is, it's all, it's like context is a huge,

Speaker 6:          01:33:38       has a lot to do with it. Remember how I told you that time where it's like, you know, sometimes you can just fall asleep on the floor. I know we're in the beach, but then sometimes you get in, you're on your couch or wherever and you just can't fall asleep, can get comfortable and stuff, you know, because you expect that comfort is what I'm saying. But if you don't have any comfortable expectations, it's like you just be, you're just comfortable. It's almost like you're just appreciative for any kind of comfort. But if you expect mass comfort, it's like you can't get enough comfort, you know, cause you just expect more. It's weird. So like, like, um, okay, so you, you know, you have experience with cold water, right? Getting it nickel, hit the surf. So when you're there, how hard is that? Just not, not right.

Speaker 6:          01:34:26       You're just like, we're just doing it. Yeah. This is what we're doing. This is, we're, we're whatever, it's cold. It sucks, whatever. Even if it's, but in the, this is me keep in mind, but still I think it holds true. So I'm getting in the shower the other day. It's cold here, California, whether it's, go tell that to Pete. Well Pete's gonna understand because he, this probably happened to him too. So listen, you know how you're cold, you know like it's just sort of cold. So someone had to take a shower and you know the kind of, when you turn on the shower it's not just doesn't come

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       out all warm. It got it. It takes a few seconds or whatever. So, so I turned it on and hits me. Oh cause you take warm showers that day. I should do a warm shower. Anyone understood. Anyway, the cold water like kind of hit me and I was, oh there's no way I could bear going underneath that showered like before it gets warm. No way man. No Way. But then, and then whatever it heats up. But I'm thinking like, no, like Jocko guys go in that cold surf like for a long time. And so then I'm thinking, oh it's totally in context. You know, like if I, let's say a minute before I walked in the shower, I was like, I'm going to take a cold shower right now doing it literally the same exact time I can do it. You see what I'm saying? So it's like a mindset kind of thing, Jack, even aside from the training, of course, I would say this and the reason that I can't me, it's just like blank.

Speaker 5:          01:35:55       No, it's not here. Maybe it is real, but no, I dunno. Thinking about this when you get out of bed, right? Well then again, your routine's different, but yeah, let's say you're just sort of, I have an actual ice bath. Yeah, but that's different to a bright, he said, Dick, I spent the whole time. Okay. But that's the what I'm saying. Like what if you get out of no out of bed or you're just cruising at home, which you probably don't do, but let's say you were, and it was just cold. The kind like heart and pretty cold right now. I shouldn't put on a jacket right now. Let's Hoodie. Whatever. That's how cold it is right here, right? Not Freezing, but just I'm cold right now. Uncomfortably cold. And then let's say your son comes with a cup of ice water and dumps it on you.

Speaker 5:          01:36:38       Right? How'd you sneak up on me? It's like you're saying, okay, maybe it didn't sneak up on you. Maybe he was, I dunno, but let's say he poured ice water idea. Okay. You're just telling me that you're like whatever. That wouldn't, you'd be Viking like can be like whoa. Like I dunno, it's not cold. Well, I tell you, if he was looking for a reaction from me, I wouldn't get it right. Which I dig. I dig it. There would be a grappling match happening real quick though. Yeah. Yeah. And I understand is an attack. Okay. So that aside, I'm talking about the actual cold water, but it's, so, it's not nothing, but it's something, but it's something. But that compare that experience to, if he came up to day, Hey dad, I have this cup of cold water. It's kind of cold right now. Do you think you can like endure this?

Speaker 5:          01:37:27       Right? And you were like, Oh yeah, I can endure it, do it. And he did it. I'm not saying now it'd be nothing or something. I'm saying that those two experiences are different. Okay. Yeah. See what I'm saying? So this is the element of surprise is that we're talking about one year. Was his surprise wonder or not? If your surprise it going to throw you off a little bit. Yeah. If you're not surprised, your brace for it, you're good to go. Yeah. I mean as surprise. That's just one element of a different context where you don't necessarily exist. It's surprise and mental preparation. Mental preparation is, I think the overarching cause surprise would fall under the mental preparation stuff going on in your head, telling you that shower experience kind of in linkedin being a little bit anyway. Okay. Be comfortable with being uncomfortable. That's a Jujitsu sang too, by the way. Is that where you heard him mainly? Maybe that's where I first heard it. Yeah, because that's a good thing to have. Oh yeah, that's the, that's the backhanded compliment that Hixon Gracie told me when I rolled with him back in the day that you were comfortable. He goes, he said, you're very, you're very comfortable when you're in a really bad position.

Speaker 5:          01:38:39       And I was all happy. There you go. Seems good at Jujitsu. Yes. So that's what I heard too. Um, but yeah, so that's what you did to saying. So that means dude, you did to kind of really yes. Last strategy or or what, what do you call it? Rules. General rule is essentially despise delicate living is Jujitsu. Delicate living and then we'll, it is not, it's not delicate, but it's not brutal. It depends where you roll with. Yeah, that's true. That's very true. There's some blood on the mat last night, boy, I believe. Anyway. Did you get to ifs? If we're not in Jujitsu already, we might not agree on the different mindsets for cold and all that. But we do agree. Do some digits. Do just some judges too. And when you do it, you're going to need a g and what grade you get none other than thingies that are made a hundred percent in America from top to bottom, from origin, origin, main.com.

Speaker 5:          01:39:36       That's where you get them. You can get whatever you want on there and you can get a rash guard so you can do no gay as well. And then you can get a tee shirts and hoodies which are comfortable, which, which are the antithesis of what we're talking about because you have claimed and now this claim has been supported on a social media sites around the world that the origin jogger pants, which I don't, where are universally the most comfortable pants of all time. Yes, there are still, I mean, and I went on searches like my son got a pair for Christmas cause you know when you're in my family, guess what you're getting for Christmas products or just stuff. So he got a pair and I tried them on and he was like, you got to take a bottle. They were like, cause how they looked because they just don't, they're just not, they're not, it's not me.

Speaker 5:          01:40:32       Yeah. Cause joggers as functional as they are because they're super functional as far as jogging and running as functional as they are there. That's a style thing. Like they're in style right now, but they're somehow related to skinny jeans. Are they not there? At least that's the look. Yeah. Related. So you, yeah, you can't wear skin. That kind of stuff. Used to issue when I was at seal team two seal team one we didn't have at seal team two they issued us joggers, but this is back in the day. They were basically like, they were basically like the same thing because it was cold in the winter time and guys would want to run with those things on. Yeah. But I didn't wear those either. But everyone else more weight and their outer where they weren't underwear where I'm like over your running shorts. Oh, okay. Yeah. Cool.

Speaker 5:          01:41:24       There you go. Yeah. But these are, these are probably going to be way more comfortable going from origin. Um, and they're made in America by the way. I don't know if I mentioned that, but yeah, those are good geography. Here's the thing. You despise come for a while. I don't think you despise come. Not as much as I showed the, okay. That makes sense to me. I don't despise comfort. Just like, I don't despise the rest between sets because comfort is there for a reason when you're kind of cold. I guess that's what I was gonna say earlier. You enjoy comfort more when you have discomfort. Yes. Right. Oh, you don't want to be the person that's constantly in a feather pillow temperature controlled scenario. Right? You want to be in like the tough environment and then you're like, oh, this feels good now. Like when you get out of the one you've been surfing and it's cold.

Speaker 5:          01:42:11       I went surfing the other day with no wetsuit on and it's winter time here by the way. But one of my, uh, to actually have my toes were numb straight white. So how cold does that? Maybe like what, 55 something like that? Yeah. I mean I only went for like 45 minutes, but yeah, it was cold when I got done and then I went in the Jacuzzi it, it felt good to see it not despise that comfort, but it felt even better than if it was just a normal day and I wasn't, didn't have a num two toes. So really it's more about the ability to endure discomfort. That's really what it is. So the light, the less time you spend uncomfortable, the less used to it, you'll be. So Lamar or like, you know, the less capable you'll be of enduring it Kinda, that's kind of the thing.

Speaker 5:          01:43:04       Yeah. Check what they're going for anyway. [inaudible] guards, tee shirts, joggers, uh, supplements, supplements of course, joint supplements, which have shaken up to be the most important supplements there are per day. It's true indeed for a semi to moderate to highly active person. That's it. Yeah, I know this firsthand. Definitely. Uh, so joint warfare, Krill oil, those are for your joints and for your whole life. Like this stuff that's in joint warfare, Tumeric, it has all, all kinds. It's not just like, yeah, it's good for your joints, but it's good for a little, it's good for everything. Yeah. Which is, as I was reading more about it or no, there was an article that spring up, that's what it was. And I was like, wow, I didn't know that. Did all of this. No wonder. I feel so good. Anyway. Joan, where for Krill oil discipline, there's also so discipline comes in lemon lime, which is tasty.

Speaker 5:          01:44:02       There's also the new tropic thunder because I couldn't call it, we couldn't call it Pina Colada cause that just not happening. That was just a big negative. And then there's milk of course, additional protein, additional protein that tastes delicious. It tastes like a dessert. A for real dessert. And if you have kids or if you just, well if you have kids you get them a warrior kid milk, which is the best possible thing you can buy a child for food in my opinion. Yeah, it tastes well. I guess if you give him steak, I think vegetables are good too. I didn't even like steak when I was a little kid. Yeah, you like burgers. I like Burgers, but yeah, you're more refined now. It's luxurious. No though is an acquired taste getting into the steak thing, Huh? Yeah. Interesting. Plus I had to learn how to cook it better, so yeah, warrior kid milk and all that stuff from origin you can get it.

Speaker 5:          01:44:59       Origin, main.com.com also, chuck was a store, it's called Jocko store, so you go to [inaudible] dot com and this is where you can get shirts that represented the path. I want to represent discipline equals freedom. This winning equals freedom shirt here, and this is what I realized this cycle. I know, I know. I think maybe a little bit too much into it, but this happened though when you were a discipline equals freedom shirt to work out you like won't skip the work. You'll be more into the workout. I noticed that. Yeah, because you look at it and says discipline equals freedom. You know, it's like you're representing what it's actually saying. It's not one of these deals where it's like, Ooh, a cool star on your shirt or something. Which is cool. There's people that have taken that idea to the next level and gotten the discipline equals freedom.

Speaker 5:          01:45:50       Tattoos see, same exact concept and yet I've seen it in like a one dude has the desperate goes freedom. I think it's, it's basically on the inside of his wrist. Yeah. Try eating a doughnut with that hand. It's not exactly that. Just no way. That's exactly. If that happened, you'd be in serious violation, like you couldn't do it. You'd feel it. You'd be doing burpees for like 45 minutes after that. Yeah. You see an I posted a picture of the guy with it on the inside of, yeah. No. Well there's one guy that has an on subs arm. You're talking about the one guy. There's a guy that has one was wrist. Yeah, but that's the one stamp. It was that roll call. Yeah, that was put, I took the picture, but yeah, I saw that. It was good. See, same exact concept because yeah, you can't not represent. Now you know that the shirt on, boom, you got the tattoo. Now you can never know represent or are you going to pay the price to yourself by the way. So it's like a thing. I dig it, man. I dig it. Respect. Also, we get that tattoo. I think you should only get that tattoo if you,

Speaker 5:          01:46:54       if you're, you need to commit first, right? Then you commit first and then get the tattoo. Don't think that just the Tattoo's going to push you over the edge even though probably will, even though it probably, maybe that's not the best approach for a tattoo. Uh, decision making is that, that's what you're saying anyway. It's called Jocko store.com. You can get your, uh, you know the shirts and, and before you get the tattoo, get the t shirt and a hat. A hat has it first. There's a lot of fear in the game. Cool. Then you can step it up a little bit more. Hoodies. Yes. Women's stuff. I'm going to have some new stuff on there too. You keep saying that. I know, but I'm going to do it. Meanwhile, there's their patches right now or are we out of patches? Oh Wow. I don't know. Let me, let me double check and the check. Let me check with the guy that's in charge of an, Oh wait, that's you.

Speaker 5:          01:47:47       Well, rest assured. Hey, if you see something cool, get something. If something's sold out or something like that, I don't know. Let me know. I guess it won't be, or it'll be on the way. Either way. It's called Jocko, store.com. A lot of cool stuff on there. If you want something you want to represent in the wild in the wild by the way, get something also Jocko white tea on the story that we saw that on the store to buy the one. Um, but you can get this. Yeah it's good. Can get it from Amazon as well. Where else?

Speaker 5:          01:48:20       Guess what I'm drinking right now. Hot Tea. Yeah. You know why? Comfortable cause concept a little bit cold down in Boston. Yeah, it makes sense. You're no stranger to the discomfort so I think you can, you know, whatever. But yeah, it's one of those deals where even if you don't like tea that much, you'll probably like this was doesn't it tastes like tea but it doesn't taste like tea. It's can I say that? Does that make any sense? If you drink it, that makes it a dichotomy. There's a condom, Jocko, white tea. There's no dichotomy in the fact that you can be teaching the, the, the Jujitsu class at the muster. And he used the word dichotomy and then everyone started laughing. Cause the way he says it is like directly Tz directly mocking me isn't the word dichotomy. Yup. So yeah, Jack White outstanding, uh, stuff makes you dead lift 8,000 pounds, but we already knew that.

Speaker 5:          01:49:17       Yeah. Everyone knows that worldwide dead lift has increased a lot also it's in cans, which is good for me because the whole brewing tea, uh, uh, sequence uncomfortable. I'm very uncomfortable for me. Yes. So you know, Ken seems more cool, but whatever, whatever you like. Also subscribe to this podcast if you haven't already, uh, on, you know, wherever you listen to podcasts. There it is. I know. I don't think we even need to say that anymore. Okay. Well I've said that for like a, or maybe even three years that we don't need to say to subscribe to the podcast, but we do need to say subscribe to the Warrior Kid podcast. Yes. Check it out. Check it out. Even if you aren't a kid and check it out. I use a different voice in that podcast. Dave Burke was talking about it. He's like, I even like that different.

Speaker 5:          01:50:07       I use this voice right here. It's a little bit more aimed at kids. This is just the way I normally talk when I do, cause I'm kind of uncle Jake in that and he nickel Jake is a little bit more, he's not, you will, not Dorky, but he just doesn't have his little bit of a dark side. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good way of putting it. The dark edge. He's just good. He's like uncle Jake is just good across the board. You never know what, I might have a little, I might have a little issue with something and get kind of crazy on it. Jake's not going to let that happen. So check out the warrior kid podcast if you want to get some more information to your kids about being on the path and you can hear me talk and tell stories in this voice from Uncle Jake.

Speaker 5:          01:50:56       Yeah. Actually sounded exactly like how you sound on it, which is good. In a way also, yes, youtube as well, so we do have a youtube channel. If you didn't know that. It does have the video version of this podcast and also little excerpts and enhanced excerpts. By the way, I was noticing some of your recent excerpts. You can't make excerpts that are 12 minutes long. That's not an excerpts. That's just like a video. Well, technically that's not correct because an excerpt is just a part of this with the 12 minutes is long, man. I know and sometimes I'm going to be 12 minutes. There is no way that everything in that 12 minutes is important kind. Yeah, that's true. Okay, but then you pick out your editing scissors. Depends on how you look at it though. These things are supposed to be an expert should be like, aw, you know what, boom, two minutes and 28 seconds later you're like, yeah, I got this.

Speaker 5:          01:51:50       Oh, I dig it. I agree, but not a lot of time. You want people to pull up and couch and he even for some of us are on the computer doing other stuff and then boom, they're, the expert comes up, you know, about maybe. Or maybe it's like you saying something in me disagreeing and then you saying, well this is this. And I'm saying, well that's true, but what about this? And you're like, oh, okay. Or whatever. You know, it's like a little list. So like a little conversation that's not two hours. See what I'm saying? So it's presentable. It's good. It's due. Okay. So there's, there's on the youtube channel, there's the long and short excerpts. That's a good way that's digestible and there's a little bit more like, you know, mealtime conversational, uh, you know, cause it's less about like the shortness and share ability necessarily.

Speaker 5:          01:52:41       It's more about like, Hey, remember this share ability? Oh, like I can sh watch it come in it. Yeah. They're more likely to watch the minute video then the 12 minute video. But the 12 minutes, like the kind of like if you just want to hear about like the specific topic that happened to take 12 they're not all 12 minutes. This may be like eight minutes or so, maybe six either way. Psychological warfare too. Speaking of little excerpts, those are just short, short, one to two minutes of how to overcome some type of momentary weakness that you might have. If you don't have a discipline equals freedom tattoo on your wrist, that's going to keep you in. Check that. This is another thing you can do prior to getting that tattoo. You can just load up your psychological warfare on iTunes, Google play at MP3 platforms, whatever, and listen to those.

Speaker 5:          01:53:32       Yes. Which is chocolate telling you how to overcome the weakness. That is, that's that tattoo on your wrist is living equals freedom is like the ultimate psychological warfare. It is a weapon. Your weapon. Boom. Discipline. Oh, what if you put discipline on one wrist and freedom on the other wrist? I actually might do that. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. Discipline. Freedom at origin. Uh, I've been talking to Pete, we're trying to buy a machine that can make sweat bands wristbands. Right. And then once we have that power, two things, number one, I'm going to make the best wristbands cause I wear wristbands every time I workout. Yeah. And, but there's no good risk bands in the world. There's none of them that meet the standards that I would like them to meet. Why do you where we spent a sweat primarily. Oh, so it doesn't go onto to run right down my arms and my hands and I'm just dropping everything and it sucks.

Speaker 5:          01:54:27       Yeah. So, uh, I'm going to make wristbands that are super long really. Right. And really like just I told Pete and like we can put discipline a one and freedom on the other one. Right. And you can buy little set. Yeah. So anyways, peach, peach shopping for the machine right now. Good. [inaudible] yes, it can make socks. Pete sent me a picture of a machine and he goes, what do you think this makes? And I looked at it and I don't know, I just kinda like logically it was sort of like a um, you could see stuff 360 degrees around something else and I was like I bet you I said socks. And he goes day on, cause I'm not in a good district. He was impressed with my logic. Deductive skills. It's good. I'm impressed too. Speaking of being impressed, go to on it.

So if you want, if you want the audio version, it's on iTunes, Amazon music, Google play, other MP3 platforms. Obviously extreme ownership. The first book that I wrote with my brother Leif Babin, taking the lessons that we learned on the battlefield and explaining how they can be applied to your business and to your life.

Speaker 1:          01:59:21       And that was the followed up that was followed up by the book that we just had come up out called the dichotomy of leadership and this is getting granular in how to apply those leadership principles into your world. Also, we have echelon front, which is uh, my leadership consultancy and what we do is solve problems through leadership. If you have any kind of problem in your organization, it is a leadership problem. It is a leadership problem. We will help get your leadership fixed, get them aligned and get them working and get the team functioning properly. We also have a leadership conference that we do. It's called the muster in 2019 there are three monsters, May 23rd and 24th in Chicago, September 19th and 20th in Denver and December 4th and fifth in Sydney, Australia. Checkout extreme ownership.com for the details and to register all of them that we've done have sold out.

Speaker 1:          02:00:26       This is, and what I'm saying, they sold out. This is when people call me up and say, or like people that I know say, hey, hey, I know what a little late, just want to, can you just, um, can you just reserve three seats from me? And you know, these two other people that I work with and I'm like, actually no I can't. You cannot come to, we'll, we'll just end it back. No, there's fire codes that you can't come. Everyone thinks you all just, you know, no, it's sold out. So you can't come. The, the, um, the live podcasts we're doing January 9th sold out immediately. He was like, sorry. Gotta be quick on those. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:01:08       So there's that, that we do have this key f online. This is, this is the interactive training leadership training that we put together. And okay, so there's several places where this stem from. One of them is the monster itself. Cause guess what the muster is great foundational information. It's a great foundational leadership, um, instruction that you're going to get when you go. Not everyone can make it to the muster. So what we did is we took the content from the first like two monsters that we did, and this is the fundamental principles from extreme ownership, from the dichotomy leadership. We took those and put them into interactive online training so that people that couldn't make it to the muster could still get that training. We also did it because companies that we work with, sometimes they have 10,000 employees, 20,000 employees, 100,000 employees, and all the employees are not all in one place.

Speaker 1:          02:02:08       They're all over the place. They're all over the country and they're all over the world. How are we going to train all those people? W w what we needed to do was figure out a way to scale the training that we did. There were so many requests from the larger companies we work with to get the training to all their employees. How do we do that? We had to scale it so we put it online and then once we put it on mine for companies, we figured, okay, let's get it out there. For direct consumers that want to take the training, they can't come to the monster, what have you or they want to get reminded what they learned at the muster. Same thing. So that's online training. It's available now@fonline.com also we've got, yeah, Overwatch where we are taking leadership gaps in the civilian sector and we are filling those leadership gaps with trained and experienced and tested leaders from combat aviation and from the SPEC ops community go to e f overwatched.com regardless of which side of that equation you're on, whether you're a company that needs leaders, whether you're a event that seeking a leadership position in a company, go to Yaffe, overwatch.com and fill out the information that applies to you.

Speaker 3:          02:04:16       okay?

Speaker 1:          02:04:17       You need a little bit of fury. You need a little bit of discipline. You need to combine those things, but you take that discipline and you impose discipline upon yourself and reject and refuse delicate living and the luxuries that are available to you in life. And
