Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number one 76 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. Usually when I write a letter it is very much overdue and I make every effort to get it away quickly. This letter however is different. It is a letter that I hoped you would never receive as it is verification of that terse black edge card which you received some time ago and which has caused you so much grief.

Speaker 2:          00:00:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:40       It is because of this grief that I wrote this letter and by the time you have finished reading it hope that it has done some good and that I have not written it in vain. It is very difficult to write now of future things in the past tense, so I am returning to the present tomorrow. We go into action as yet we do not know exactly what our job will be, but no doubt they will be a dangerous one in which many lives will be lost. Mine may be one of those lives. Well mom.

Speaker 2:          00:01:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:23       I am not afraid to die.

Speaker 2:          00:01:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:27       I like this life. Yes. For the past two years have planned and dreamed and mapped out a perfect future for myself. I would have liked that future to materialize, but it is not what I will but what God wills. Then. If by sacrificing all of this, I leave the world slightly better than I found it, I am perfectly willing to make that sacrifice. Don't get me wrong though, mom, I am no flag waving patriot, nor have I ever professed to be England's a great little country. The best there is.

Speaker 2:          00:02:08       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:02:08       but I cannot honestly and sincerely say that it is worth fighting for, nor can I fancy myself in the role of a gallon crusader fighting for the liberation of Europe. It would be a nice thought, but I would only be kidding myself. No Mom, my little world is centered around you and includes dad, everyone at home and my friends and Wolverhampton that is worth fighting for and if by doing so, it strengthens your security and improves your lot in any way than it is worth dying for to now. This is where I come to the of this letter as I have already stated. I am not afraid to die and in perfectly willing to do so if by my doing so you benefit in any way whatsoever. If you do not, then my sacrifice is all in vain. Have you benefited mom or have you cried and worried yourself? Sick.

Speaker 2:          00:03:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:29       I fear it is the ladder. Don't you see mom that it will do me no good and that in addition you are undoing all the good work I've tried to do. Grief is hypocritical, useless and unfair and does neither you nor me and he'd good. I want no flowers, no epitaph, no tears. All I want is for you to remember me and feel proud of me. Then shall I rest in peace knowing that I have done a good job.

Speaker 2:          00:04:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:15       Death is nothing final or lasting. If it were, there would be no point in living. It is just a stage in everyone's life to some, it comes early to others late, but it must come to everyone some sometime then surely there is no better way of dying besides I've probably crammed more enjoyment into my 21 years then some manage to do in 80 my only regret is that I have not done as much for you as I would've liked to do. I loved your mom. You were the best mother in the world and what I failed to do in life I am trying to make up for in death, so please don't let me down, mom. Don't worry or fret, but smile. Be Proud than satisfied. I never had much money, but what little I have is all yours. Please don't be silly and sentimental about it and don't try to spend it on me. Spend it on yourself or the kiddies. It will do some good that way.

Speaker 2:          00:05:39       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:40       Remember that where I am, I am quite okay and providing, I know that you are not grieving over me shall be perfectly happy. Well mom, that is all, and I hope I have not written it all in vain. Goodbye and thanks for everything your unworthy son Ivoire

Speaker 2:          00:06:22       and

Speaker 1:          00:06:24       that was a letter from private Igor Rowbury who served in the British army in the South Staffordshire Regiment and the letter can be found in a book called last letters home.

Speaker 2:          00:06:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:40       And it was his last letter home. He was killed in og Nem on 17 September, 1944 and the opening action of Operation Market Garden, which was conceived and planned and championed by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and this massive operation overall, it's generally assessed as a failure, although history has been kind in, some people look back and fee rise that it did have a more positive impact on the battlefield then was initially thought, but nonetheless it didn't achieve, achieve its objectives and there was a significant amount of casualties. And as I said, this was Monty.

Speaker 2:          00:07:42       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:44       Montes plan is the plan that he pushed. And as I said on the last podcast about him, this is one of the things that makes him controversial, that Qi lead this, this operation market garden.

Speaker 2:          00:07:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:59       And as I said on the last podcast, he was able to redeem himself somewhat in the battle of the bulge. But this, this negative was pretty impactful.

Speaker 1:          00:08:13       And with that, that doesn't mean that there's nothing we can learn from that situation. We've covered it on the podcast, the, that, that battle from that perspective. And we have to learn, we have to learn from people's successes and people's failures just as we have to learn from our own successes in our own failures. And on the last podcast we talked with you about Monty's and view of leadership and if you haven't listened to that podcast yet, it's number one 74 that kind of talks a little bit more detail slightly about Monte and his thoughts. And we debated a little bit the meaning of the word dominate, which he kind of puts us one of these driving forces as a leader. I was, is the leader's ability to dominate. And I talked about how, I'm not quite sure where he falls with that word, you know, cause dominate can have a very negative connotation. And I actually asked for feedback in a bunch of people, gave me feedback, and I think I landed somewhere kind of in the middle. I don't think it's then dominate with the, with the, Hey, I'm just going to roll over my people. I don't think that's how he meant it. I think he, but I don't think he meant it in like, Hey, I'm just dominate. I dominate my skills and that's why I'm good. I think he meant it somewhere in the middle. And

Speaker 1:          00:09:35       then I talked about the fact that one of the other major important factors that Monte talks about his morale, and he wrote another little thing about morale called morale and battle. And I think, I actually wish I would have covered this one first. And this one almost trumps the, the, the leadership, his thoughts on leadership because I think this is even more applicable and relatable, but it's, it's good solid stuff from someone that led to massive numbers of troops in battle and saw a lot of war war in World War One and World War Two obviously. So with that morale in battle, and we're going to jump right into it. Here we go. This paper is an attempt to analyze what is at the root of morale and battle and thereby to discover how it can be developed. High Morale is defined as endurance and courage in supporting fatigue and danger.

Speaker 1:          00:10:41       In other words, the quality which makes men go forward in an attack and hold their ground in defense. It is the quality without which no war can be one. So this is, uh, this is, uh, uh, and I'll get to this. In the end, he, he talks about morale being the most important factor on the battlefield. Obviously I think leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield, and I'll break that down a little bit later. But from his perspective as a guy that had led massive operations, he feels morale is the most important thing. So without a doubt it is important. Here we get into his thoughts on it, and again, I think you're going to see this, the stuff that he talks about, morale, he seems to nail this, I think even better than the nails leadership. So here we go. The quality of morality in war, the moral stature of some men increases and their characters grow stronger and more close, closely knit in proportion to the discomforts and dangers which they are called upon to face.

Speaker 3:          00:11:45       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:11:45       I said this over and over again. War War can make you stronger. War Can make a better person. This is something that Peter t and I talked about when he first came on the podcast and we talked about families that were slightly fractured and if they have a, a major incident, a medical emergency, somebody gets wounded, somebody gets cancer. If the family's close, it'll make them closer. If the family's fractured, it'll blow them apart. He's saying the same thing here. Back to the book. Such men will occasionally perform in battle. Remarkable acts of selfless courage and daring and will endure with extraordinary fortitude and patience. The burdens thrust upon them, other men. However, we'll under the stress of hardships or dangers, surrender to fear or fatigue and will allow their characters to disintegrate. So it was the same thing that Peter t was talking about with families, and this is the same thing with any team or organization.

Speaker 1:          00:12:41       You have a team that's pretty close and they go through something rough. They get even closer. You have a team that's kind of fractured and they go through something tough, they're going to explode. Same thing happens with people's personalities and character in war. This disintegration is usually, we'll usually take the form of a loosening of the moral fiber, which results in timidity of Action and slackness in appearance. He talks a lot about appearance. One of these guys in battle, men who have kept a firm grip upon themselves will appear clean and vital in their appearance. While those who have gone to seed will be dirty and their appearance, we'll uh, we'll be slovenly. So he's one of those guys. Okay. If you don't look at, and this is obviously this is the much of the military, they will judge you on how you look. That's not always true. Sometimes you get a guy that looks like a rogue street person and he's a good operator and sometimes not. It depends.

Speaker 1:          00:13:47       Similarly, timid officers will be found during quiet periods in the line groveling in the filth of some seller while they're signalers and runners separated from the light attempt to do their jobs by the flame of a guttering candle. And these latter cases, there has been a general loosening of the character due to a partial surrender to fear. So you get these timid officers that are out there and they cower and they're scared and they, while their troops are up trying to do their job. In extreme cases, men who have become afraid have sunk to the level of beasts, no longer in full control of themselves. They have become as sheep or rabbits unable to act or alone or think rationally. Their instincts have become those of the herd. They are either paralyzed by fear or gripped by unreasoning panic. Such men are exceptions, but they are a reminder of the value of high morale. The good soldier, the man with high morale has not surrendered to fear and has maintained his personal standards. The bad soldier, the man with low morale has become incapable of dependent action of independent action and has to some extent shed apart of his human individuality. So this is what you get people at all freaked out and they don't act for themselves anymore. There's going to fall to her.

Speaker 1:          00:15:19       Morale is a mental and moral quality. It is a quality peculiar to human beings because it is essentially the product of a mind with a conscience.

Speaker 3:          00:15:29       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:15:30       It is that which in battle keeps men up on humanities level as opposed to being a beast. But humanities level's not high enough because the strongest human instinct is the instinct of survival. Morale is also that which develops man's latent hero wisdom so that he will overcome his desire to take the easy way out and surrender to fear.

Speaker 3:          00:15:55       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:15:56       So you gotta be a little bit beyond human because the human instinct, the strongest human instinct is, I'm just going to stay alive. That's my goal. You gotta be, you gotta be more than that. You gotta be better than that.

Speaker 3:          00:16:07       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:16:09       It is necessary now to make clear what high morale is not. It is not contentment or satisfaction. Bread for ease or comfort of living.

Speaker 3:          00:16:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:22       Both of these container hint of complacency and acceptance of luxury as an end in itself. High morale is far more than any of these for it implies essentially the ability to triumph over discomforts and dangerous and carry on with the job. So if you're one of these leaders and you're in a leadership position and you think, well, you know, um, what, how do I raise my, the morale of my men? Give them luxury days, give him feel. Von Luxury days, the o negative not happening that that doesn't do it back to the book. Nor is no because, sorry, because what you have to do, you have to give them challenge. You have to give them discomfort or not. You have to give them, they have to face discomfort. They have to face danger. And that's what increases morale when they face nape. Triumph over that. That's what, that's what increases morale. A pizza.

Speaker 3:          00:17:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:18       And find satin sheets do not increase morale. They might do a little surface nudge, but they don't increase Rupp morale. Otherwise your morale would be through the roof, off through the rooms all day. We'd sold it. So the morale is so it's like not to be confused because you do need like the rest between six. Right. And it's different and you can't just beat people down all through. Right, right. You can't, you can't, you know, you have to get sleep, you have to get rushed, you have to have level of comfort or your morale will get beat down. But that can't be the primary aim of you as leaders to provide comfort. It's not like, Hey, let's boost morale by letting people sleep or whatever. Right. Or not letting them see, but you know, yeah. Give him love. Give them, give them two days off. How about one day off and we come back and train hard and work.

Speaker 1:          00:18:07       Yeah. It seems like you wouldn't, you wouldn't give them the day off if they don't need the day off. Like you need the day off for something very specific, like some sort of a fatigue situation or whatever. Bottom line is, it's a dichotomy, right? Can you go too far with comfort and pleasure and leisure? Yes, you can. Can you go too far with discipline and hardness and sternness and scarcity of resources? Yes, you can. You have to find a balance somewhere in the middle. I think the point here is that people lean towards, well, if I want to increase morale, I just need to give luxury to the troops. That's the, that's the wrong way to lean. You should actually lean, I'm not saying go full bore, but you should lean in the direction of hard training, discipline, lean in that direction. Don't go full bore in that direction and lean in that direction.

Speaker 1:          00:18:54       Yeah. It's almost like, I mean, you'd think about it, it seems like making them feel what? Like empowered or strong, right leg. That's kind of the result you're going to, let me just break it. Break it down for you. Real simple. If you go and you have a good training, Jujitsu, how do you feel when you're done? How's your morale? Pretty high. Morale is high. If you sit there and watch TV all day and you eat a pizza and a donut, how do you feel at the end of the day? How's your morale? Shabby. Morales. Shabby. You know, if you train Jujitsu nine hours for 14 days straight. Yeah. How do you feel broken down, right? And then how do you feel when it's like, hey man, day off today. Echo all good. Hey, guess what? I ordered some pizza for you too. It's common. It's gonna be here in 15 minutes.

Speaker 1:          00:19:36       We're gonna chow down. We're going to watch the fights. Cool. That's a good morale boost. We're all good. Yeah, but you've got to find that balance. Yeah. All right. Back to the book. Nor is high morale achieved through fitness or healthiness alone is important. Not to confuse the idea of physical happiness with morale. The happy faces of men after a good game of football are not necessarily the faces of men with good morale. Morale is a mental rather than a physical quality. A determination to overcome obstacles and instinct of instinct driving a man forward against his own desires. Oh, driving a man forward against his own desires. That's a good one. That's a good one. And he detaches the physical and the mental part a little bit more than I do. I think they're a little bit more closely related. I think that when you're in good physical shape, it helps your mental morale.

Speaker 1:          00:20:29       But he goes on to say this, which is spot on high morale is not happiness. Happiness may be a contributory factor in the maintenance of morale over a long period, but it is no more than that. A man can be unhappy, but can still regularly and without complaining, advanced and defend within the terms of the definition. So that's, so that's an important thing. And again, this is a, this is a trap that leaders get suckered into. Hey, if I can make my people happy than morale's good. No, no pizza. We'll make your people happy, but it won't increase morale. Hmm. It might increase morale if you can give it at the right time for the right reason. Do you eat Hawaiian Pizza? No. Is that just a lie? That's a complete violation. We don't even, we don't even need that kind of pizza in Hawaii, generally speaking. Correct. Well, there you go. That's the thing. It's like it's like Canadian making. What does, what does Hawaiian Pizza due to your morale?

Speaker 1:          00:21:31       Apparently its inhibitor. Yeah. It's an inhibitor. Well, you know like Canadian Bacon? Yes. Like Canadians. Like, Hey, is this Canadian? You know Canadian Bacon's just a little piece of ham basically. Yeah. You go, hey, someone from Canada and be like, Hey, this is Canadian bacon. The lake. No, that's him. Have you made that up? Have you ever had an English muffin before? Yes. You can't get them in England because they don't, yeah, they just call him just like French fries, right? Yeah. Or wait is in French. In France. They're called something else though. Chips. They're now called French fries. No, that's England. I think they're called pawn. All right, that makes sense. Same deal then. All right. This is an important other, this again, you can see them. I was in going through this to figure out what I was going to, what parts I was going to single out.

Speaker 1:          00:22:13       I ended up doing so much of this one. Yeah, because almost every line is like, yes, you need to know that. Yes, I need to know that. I need to remember that. So here's one. High morale is not toughness. This one caught me a little off guard. Some very tough men in this war of turned out to be very disappointing in action. Toughness is a physical and not a mental asset. Tough men will occasionally perform an isolated act of bravery. Morale however, is not a quality which produces a momentary act. It influences behavior at all times. So that's completely true. And it's true and it's true in combat. It's true. And training even like some, somebody like going through what basic seal training. There were some tough guys. They're like tough where you go though. That guy seems like a tough guy. Quitter. And then, and then there's guys that get through buds, it's like, oh, they were toughing buds.

Speaker 1:          00:23:12       Like they did some good job in bonds, but it has nothing to do with how well you're going to do as a seal. Like it does. It's, I would say there's some correlation, but it's, it's a very loose correlation. Being a good seal buds trainee has very little to do with being a good seal in a seal team. And I think that sometimes surprises people. But then again, it shouldn't really surprise people because being good at Budz Budz is, is a physical evolution, has very little to do with you, with your mentality. And it has very little to do with leadership and unit cohesion. And so to show up at a team, what's the most important thing when you get your team? The most important thing when you get to a team is to be a team member and be a leader in that team or a follower in that team.

Speaker 1:          00:24:03       If you aren't those things, you're not going to be good. You can be super tough. That's great. And there's times when it pays to be tough and you definitely as a seal, you can't not be, you can't not have some level of toughness. You know? When I think about being a seal there, stuff that you just do on a regular basis, that when it's your life, when it's just the way your life is, you don't really think about it. But when you take a step back and you think about what you like, when I think about my old job, and I'm talking about going back to the 90s right? Oh, we're going to go, we have dive week, which is, or dive training. So you'd go for like four or five weeks of dive training and you're diving two times a day. It's your wet suit, your your you wetsuits wet when you're putting it back on, and then you're going to go get in a boat and you're going to drive for an hour and a half up the coast, and then you're going to, it's going to be dark and you're going to put on your Drager rebreather and you're going to get in that water again and you're going to kick in the darkness with bio luminescence flying around you for three and a half hours.

Speaker 1:          00:25:16       You're going to get into this random harbor, you're freezing cold. You're going to plant. I'll a limpid and fake limpet mine on some big navy ships somewhere. Then you're going to paddle your swim, fin your way back out. You're going to run out of oxygen. Once you run out of oxygen are going to come to the surface and then you're going to swim on the surface for another 48 minutes, and then you meet up with that little Zodiac boat. You get in, you're freezing, you're exhausted, and then you drive an hour and 20 minutes to get back to core auto. When you get back, you're going to debrief, you're going to get take care of your Zodiacs, they're going to take care of your dive regs. Then you're going to take care of your personal gear. Then you're going to take a shower and they're going to sleep for three hours and you're going to wake up with another dive mission.

Speaker 1:          00:26:00       Tasking, you're gonna do the same thing again. Just cold, wet, miserable. That's the life. That's the life. So do you got to have some level of mental toughness? Sure you do and every has got that. But this part talking about like, you know, when you start talking about leadership and being a team player and being a, being a good leader and being a good follower and being smart in tactically sound and being a good decision makers, those are the things that matter. When you start talking about the just the idea of being tough, it's like that's cool and it's important and everyone in the teams has that or most people in the teams have that baseline. Uh, because it is a little bit challenging too to make it through seal training. If you don't at least have some level, it does happen. You get some guys where you think, man, what happened to you or you know, you just break down.

Speaker 1:          00:26:52       Some people have the idea that once they get through seal training and they're done, you know, you shouldn't be in seal training to go through seal training. You should be at seal training to, to get to the seal teams, to serve your country, to go into combat, to take the fight to the enemy. That's why you joined the seal teams, not to see how tough you are. So next in brief, high morale is a quality which is good in itself and is Leighton and all men. It maintains human dignity in an in enables fear and fatigue to be overcome. It is involved with the idea of a conscience, but it should be not confused with fitness or happiness or toughness. So he goes to pretty good lengths to make that distinction. Section two basic factors of morale. It is now necessary to consider what factors constitute the morale of the soldier in the heat of battle.

Speaker 1:          00:27:43       Certain factors may be described as a essential conditions without which high morale cannot exist. These four basic factors are one, leadership to discipline. Three, comradeship for self respect, a fifth factor, devotion to cause must exist but need need not necessarily influenced all of the soldiers. Finally, there are numerous contributory factors which are of great importance but not essential conditions. So that's what he's got. The four things that you have to have in order to have high morale. And then the first factor of course is leadership, which again, he's supporting my argument that leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield. If you don't have leadership, you're not gonna have good morale. So right there, I already got you beat Mani.

Speaker 1:          00:28:31       And guess what? His second one is discipline. Where does that come from? Leadership. Sure. What about comradeship? That's comes with all these things come from him. Anyways, we'll get to that. Leadership. Morale is in the first place based on leadership. Good morale is impossible without good leaders. The quality of leadership is one which must be studied. Human beings are fundamentally alike in in that very common characteristics apply to all men in varying degrees in. This is why such a great dichotomy of humans is that all humans are the same and all humans are different, right? Like you know it's true. How can that be true? All humans are the same. All humans are different and that's a completely true statement in battle. The most important of these characteristics is fear. All men are afraid at one time or another and to a greater or lesser extent in moments of fear, they band together and look for guidance.

Speaker 1:          00:29:29       They seek for a person to give decisions. They look for a leader in times of war. The leader has opportunities denied to him in peace. The difficulties, dangers and discomforts, inseparable from the battlefield make men cry out for the leadership they can do without in peace. At such moments, men are too weak to stand alone. They find the burdens too great to bear and their own selves unequal to the task. The leader himself accepts the burdens of others and by doing so earns their greatest and the right or their gratitude and the right to lead them. So challenging times things are going sideways, bad things are happening. That's when people are most susceptible to leadership.

Speaker 3:          00:30:15       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:30:16       This is completely sure ever, ever seen a team dynamic where like when everyone, everything's going good pretty much like you can get, it might be hard to tell who the leader is and then all of a sudden something happens, something that's chaotic or something that's challenging happens and then you can see that leader just rise to the top. I've seen that a million times. I seen that a million times in platoons through training and how you kind of not really knowing what's going on, who's really good, who, who's really running this. Boom. You start hitting these guys with some down men and some IED in the training battlefield. You'll see the real leaders will start to step up. Hopefully they will step up at all, but, and this is totally true, you see people want to be led, people want to be led. There's going to be sometimes a little leadership vacuum and sometimes you got to step in and fill that leadership vacuum back to the book.

Speaker 1:          00:31:07       Consider a platoon I. E. 30 men in action in the line. They, the men are drawn from all classes into all types. They are there in the line because they have obeyed a long series of orders, which it was easier to obey than to disobey, but now the test comes. It is easier for them not to obey orders. It is easier for them to stay where they are behind the hail and not advance over the crest into full view of the enemy who lies in weight of beyond the dominant motive force, which drives them over the hill is the leader.

Speaker 1:          00:31:42       It is his quality of leadership above all things which inspires the men to action. And this is one of those, he paints that out very clearly. You when people talk about, well you know, in the military of just does what you said, cause you're in charge, right? Oh we'll try that once everyone's going to die. Well once you're, you're lives are at stake. People just don't Roger Up to say, Oh that's hey echoes plans kind of lame to go charge the machine gun nest, but you know what? He's in charge. I'm going to go do it. No, doesn't work. You have to lead these men recognizing their leaders, some quality which they themselves do not possess. That quality is decision. Fear makes men sluggish and indecisive, unable to decide and act for themselves. And this is, this is, you know, people talk about, uh, being frozen by fear or, or have you ever had that thing where you're quite sure what you're gonna do?

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       Like you, oh, well, I don't know if I want to do this. I don't know if I want to even like a, like something stupid like a, not something stupid, but you know, buying a house, right? That's a big purchase. You're going to lay down a bunch of money. The market could go up or down. You're committing to a payment for 30 years. There's not so many things in life you commit to for 30 years. Basically. There's only one other one. You're getting married. Right? Is there any other commitment? That's 30 years, I guess. You get a tattoo that's a lifetime, right? So there's these decisions that you have to make and sometimes we don't. Sometimes you see people don't want to make decisions, right? They don't want to make a decision. What's making him indecisive or you think about it, what's making people indecisive is fear. They're afraid of what that outcome might break. Yeah. So if you find yourself being indecisive, instead of asking yourself, is this the right decision or wrong decision? Ask Yourself, what am I afraid of? Back to the book of the leader's power over his men is based on his ability to cut through this, this fear paralysis, and in doing so to enable others to escape from it, the rightness of the decision taken by the leader is irrelevant.

Speaker 1:          00:33:50       Think about that from a leadership perspective. If there's a decision that needs to be made, whether you're right or wrong is irrelevant. What you need to do is be decisive. What matters is that the decision should be taken and that the leader should shoulder the responsibility for that decision. The leader must convince his men of its rightness, even though he himself might be maybe uncertain of his own judgment. If the leader will decide, the men will follow and fight. If there is indecision, they will hesitate and flee

Speaker 1:          00:34:23       in short fight and survive or fear and be slain. The leader decides, yeah, moving on. The leader's power of in of the leader's power of decision results from his ability to remain impersonable in the crisis has calmness, prevents panic, and his resolution compels action. It follows that this if falls from this, that the leader must be less fearful than his men. He need not be impervious to fear. Since men require a human figure to lead them, what he must do is radiate an atmosphere of confidence, which will show his men that he has less afraid than day. He must have the moral courage to stand firm when his men are wavering in this respect, they will judge him by his power of thought and action and crisis. Fear destroys the faculty of thought and Paralyzes Action. The leader must continue to think longer than his men and his thoughts must lead to action.

Speaker 1:          00:35:31       Oh, there you go. Don't panic. Don't freak out. You got to stay calm. And how do you do that? You train for it and how do you, and when you train for it, what do you learn from the training? You learn how to say, too detached. That's what you learn how to do. That's how you keep your emotions in check. You don't let them get ahold of you. The leader's greatest asset is the ability to act normally in abnormal conditions. This is normal face 101 to continue to think rationally when his men have ceased to think to be decisive and action when they are paralyzed by fear.

Speaker 2:          00:36:03       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:36:03       so this is a, that section is something you should always strive to do from a leadership perspective. Stay calm, don't panic. Think about what's happening. He didn't say it, but I'm going to say it. Detach mentally so you don't get caught up in the emotion and the fear and the chaos. Next, the object of training must be firstly to select those who possess within them. The potentiality is of leadership and second, to develop these pen potentiality. So yes, you've got to look for who's going to be a good leader and then you've got a home. That leader. This is accomplished by giving the leader responsibility. Boom. My favorite cure for leadership problems is put people in leadership positions. A leader's character will develop in proportion to the responsibility with which he has been in trusted. The more responsibility you put on someone, the more responsible they're going to become. Think about the little kids, right? Think about a little kid. The more responsibility you give a little kid, the more mature they're going to be, the more responsibility they're going to take. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:37:11       It starts with making your own peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Yup. You should be doing that on your own. As soon as it's physically possible, you're going to make a mess. Guess what? Then you learn to clean up the mess. Every time you break down and you make that PB and j for your little child, you're taking responsibility away from them and you're making them a weaker human being and they feel it and they feel it. I made my, she's six, my daughter [inaudible] set the table. You know, they'll try to say yes at the table. Yep. And she knew what it was, but she hadn't really gone through the whole deal before. So sure enough, she's like, you know, she didn't want to, but I'm like, hey, you know, you set the table, this is what you do. You know, you're, you're kind of, you know, this is your job, this is your duty kind of thing.

Speaker 1:          00:37:59       So once she set like the first one yeah. And she did it correctly, she was rolling with it. It was her table. She was like, Hey, I'm, I'm here. Boom. She was making decisions. All this donorship Oh, full lot being up. Oh yeah. And you could tell just in her tone, Kinda like she was super empowered. Little six year old. Yeah. You know, where and kind of to look on the whole situation where this was someone who didn't want to do it, didn't, it was a chore. They want to do the chore, but you know, you implement it. You know what I mean? In my case correctly. Do you give them ownership? That's what you did. Echo Charles. You gave your daughter

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       your job. This is your responsibility. You do. This is how you do it. But you do it. You make it happen. That, and I use that term a lot and make it up and it's weird. I don't know what it is about that term with my specific kids cause that's what that feels good. Yeah. Like you have influence over this whole situation about it. When you're a, as a human being, it's kind of weird that you can make things happening straight up. Right? Yup. Yup. It's a positive thing. Yeah man. And yeah, that's a good one. Making it and make it up and make it out. And you know, like, cause and adults do this too. I do this, we'll do this. Maybe you don't. I Dunno. But you know how like if you say, Hey, can you do this? And then whether you don't want to or you don't know how to, you're just sketch about, you know, the whole thing.

Speaker 4:          00:39:19       You ask a lot of questions, well what if this, like people do that. It's almost like they put a bunch of excuses preloaded, yeah. To indicate, hey, I can't really do this, you know, kind of thing. And it's almost like just maybe it's like them being hesitant and maybe it's everything, you know, all this thing. So my kids will do that a lot, you know, like all but well what is, you know, all these questions kind of thing indicating they don't want to do it. They want to throw up all this smoke so you finally just go, Hey, I'll do it or whatever. And I started saying that, I was like, I don't know, make it happen. And they just do it. They just make it happen. It's all there. I mean sure the job won't be the greatest the first time kind of thing, but they have that attitude of just making it happen.

Speaker 4:          00:39:59       You know, you ever, you ever heard like the old guy that's like when I was your age? Yeah. Sometimes it's me. No, you just made me think that cause I do that, Eh, you know, I'll be like, when I was your age, I wasn't a seal platoon. Are you kidding me? That doesn't work in my case. Did that ever work for you? It does, man will never work because you know when one of my older kids that are my age when I wasn't a seal platoon, it's like, you know, you're asking me how to do like some such simple life thing or asking me to do it for you. Like are you serious right now? Are you serious right now? Yeah. When I was your age, I was in a seal platoon. I was going on deployment overseas. I had guns and radios and encryption devices and you're telling me what you know, whatever the thing is, you can't make that happen.

Speaker 4:          00:40:53       Is that where you're at right now? And then couldn't be what I was your age. I always feel like when my dad or whatever would say that and I feel like if I say to my kid, they're going to be thinking like it's not cool. It's not. It's, it's, I'm actually saying this, putting myself like in a little bit of check we talked about last time, you know, you can't just be like, well, when I was, yeah, no, you need to be, I need to do a better job. But it is good. The thing is it is good to cause the way my, there'd be usually my older daughter because my oldest daughter, cause she's the one that actually is of age when I was in, she actually takes it in a, in a positive way. Like she'll have a look on her face. Like I am actually being like really, really dumb right now to be even asking this.

Speaker 4:          00:41:38       Like I can obviously figure this thing out. Whatever it is. You know some, you know the DMV. How do you set an appointment at the DMV? Are you serious right now? Are you serious right now? Make it happen. You can't figure that out. You'd never heard of something called Google. Think of how easy things are now. But you can't even do that. No, not happening. I wasn't, uh, I wasn't damn seal platoon when I was your age. I was responsible for stuff. They were telling me, you can't figure out how to set an appointment at the DMV. Are you kidding me? This is what I think is the hypothesis. I think that you saying enough like stuff to your older daughter. In this case where she can relate, where resonate, like I get what you're saying and yes, I think that once you see what always drew Joe's in a seal platoon, she goes perp, she checks out.

Speaker 4:          00:42:24       No, that's what I need to be careful of. That's what I need to be careful of. The other thing I'll get from my kids, which is more your, you know your, you will you, you know what I mean? They, they kind of, yeah. I'm not like, well that's of course you did that. And I'm like, no, no you did not true. It's not just like, oh I did that because I'm more squared away than you are. No, you're actually more capable than I ever was, but doesn't need to step up your game. I know and hit, and this is my whole point. The thing is, you're correct with what you're saying. You're crying, but from the kids' standpoint, they don't believe that. Like mine, if my dad would tell me that kind of stuff, I'd be like, yeah I can. I literally think that's it.

Speaker 4:          00:43:01       Cause you're, you not to say that you're tougher or your whatever. It's like bright, you're you, you lived in the caveman days, leave me alone about like figuring, but then if you're like, hey, go make the DMV appointment, go and Google figure it out kind of thing that, that relates to them. I was like, yeah, he's right. Yeah. And if she's a grownup essentially, you know, she's going to choose to read when my son was like 10 years old. Yeah. And in my son's a good surfer and I was out surfing with them and watching them surf and I said, you know, he was paddling. I just caught a wave, like beautiful wave and he's paddling out and I said, in a little while you're going to be a better surfer than I what I am. And I thought he'd say, oh, that's cool. He looked at me like I was completely insane and like, it was the craziest, like it'd be like he, you could see in his eyes, he thought that that was not a cumin Lee possible thing that would ever happen.

Speaker 4:          00:43:56       I mean, imagine that. Like that's the look in his face and he kinda, he kinda just completely shrugged it off. I was like, yeah, right. Yeah. And I mean, six months later he was better than me and now he's just like infinitely better than me. But to your point, when you know, when you're looking up at dad, then sometimes it's, this is an unachievable thing. Yeah. And actually that's not true. And the young kids got to recognize that they can outperform their lame parents if they put their mind to it. Yeah. And same thing that happens with

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       subordinates, right? You have your subordinate on your team and you think, hey, you have more skill than I ever had. You have more talent than I ever had. If you apply it correctly, you will be able to outperform me without question. And sometimes people look at you like, oh, you're crazy. That could never happen. It's like, no, it can happen. It can happen. But you got to train. That's another thing is people think, oh, well, you just, this is natural. No, no, no. Oh No. Oh yeah. The on the other thing, you know, I mean that's why, that's another thing like when we, when I was on with, um, when we had captain plumb and Jim Lawn and they were like throwing me in the basket of being like them and I'm like, hey guys, this is all, just check yourselves. I'm 47 years old and I'm barely hanging on to like figuring this stuff out.

Speaker 1:          00:45:22       I'm not in the about in the game with you guys in terms of figuring out what you all have figured out. I mean, those guys are leaps and bounds and, and iteration upon iteration of knowledge above me and, and I'm just sitting there thinking, take it easy. Captain Plumb. Yeah. But again, that's just kind of a, a matter of perspective. You know, like things can seem so much like they can seem like a very, something very specific, but just because of your perspective, you know, you don't get a whole picture, you know, you know? Yeah. All right. Check. Going back to the book. His position as the man responsible for the lives and wellbeing of his men must be impressed upon him in battle is preop his preoccupation with his men's affairs. We'll give him less time to think of his own fears. The mere fact of responsibility will increase the leaders powers of decision and make him confident of his ability to handle any crisis.

Speaker 1:          00:46:27       So you've got to train people in these challenging situations. Training must also seek to equip the leader with the other qualities which will help him in his task. Here are those qualities. A leader should be efficient. He should possess self confidence. He should be firm, and just in his dealings with his men, he should be clear cut and definite in giving orders. He should pay attention to administrative details. He should prepare his men and advanced for any new experience they may have to meet. All these things are important, but they can never be a substitute for a decision in action and be calmness in crisis.

Speaker 1:          00:47:12       Yeah, stay calm. Now, one thing that I get a little nervous about talking about decision and action is sometimes what that means, whether the way that translates to a young platoon leader is not going to make a decision right now. Hey, everyone, you know a bone, I'm going to jump into it and you can't do that. You have to do assessment. You have to look at what the situation's going and actually you know, you've got to have a protocol of how you're going to make those decisions, right? You've got to think about way the way it's going to go down. You can't just jump at the first thing that pops into your mind. You need to think about it. You need to think about the options. You need to think about the consequences of those options, and then you need to see if you can move in the right direction without full commitment, right?

Speaker 1:          00:47:57       Do you have to occasionally make full commitment on decision? Yes. If you're, if you've got ambushed and you're in the kill zone, guess what? You're going to have to do assault through the ambush. That's what you're going to have to do it. You're going to have to do it decisively and powerfully and with full a hundred percent commitment, but if you take some rounds but you're not sure if it's an ambush, well, you might not want to necessarily assault through that position, so you need to think. You need to allow things to develop a zoo. It's a very, it's part of the art of leadership was teaching young seal leaders. Okay, you need to let the situation develop. Here's the problem. Once the situation starts developing, if you let it develop too far, it's gone. It's out of control now, right? It's, it's a, it's a little, it's a little problem, right?

Speaker 1:          00:48:48       When you look at it, then you need to look at the problem and make sure you understand the problem. Meanwhile, the problem in some cases is growing. If you allow the problem to grow too much now you can't control the problem anymore and you're going to get crushed by the problem. If you, if you see a small problem and you jumped right into solving the problem, that might, the problem might not be what you thought it was and you went out at the wrong direction. So there's a fine line like decision and action is important, but thoughtful decision is what it should be. Thoughtful decision. And the reason I'd keep trying to stress and articulate to people that you don't necessarily need to make a full commitment to a plan. You can take them, you can take a smaller step, an iterative step in the right direction before you just jump in.

Speaker 1:          00:49:37       So that's just important to think about. How does all that compare to making no decision? We'll make no decisions. The worst thing you can do, right? Make no decision standing there in the kill zone, getting overrun by the enemy and everyone killed. That's the worst thing you can do. We want to at least make some kind of a decision. Yeah. So that's why I think he stresses. So the importance of decision inaction so much is because he's probably seen people be indecisive and battle and it's a horrible, horrible thing. So yes, you want to be decisive, but let's take that one little step further. We want to have fought full decisions. Do we want to have a mental 20 minute debate over the decision? No. A thought can take five seconds. You can let it sit. You can let us situation develop for for eight seconds and you go, wait a second. I think this is what's happening. Let me confirm. Do I see anyone over there? Uh, Yup. What did the enemy fire is increasing. You know what? We need to make this move. Boom. You do it. That's what we're talking about. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:50:39       Back to the book. These are two vital attributes of a leader with which he will succeed and without which he will fail. These two vital quality vital qualities exist in varying degrees in every leader. Those men who possess them to a limited extent can nevertheless become adequate leaders by being trained in the quality's already a numerated. Such leaders must in the first place be efficient. This efficiency will impress itself on the men thereby creating an atmosphere of confidence with which will partially compensate for any lack of personality. By this means training can make men into competent but not outstanding leaders.

Speaker 5:          00:51:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:18       There's another aspect of leadership in its relation to morale. The best type of leader earns the respectful admiration of his men because he possesses certain good qualities which they lack. A brutal leader who disregards the feelings of his men will not infuse them with the quality of self respect, the morale of the troops. He commands regardless of his qualities as leader will not be the highest. So even Monte who kind of comes across as being, you know, aloof to the troops. He's, there you go. The brutal leader is not going to have good morale. Hmm. Factually an element of self respect, self respect. There's a whole section on self respect that's coming. Yeah. But yes, if you have a dog and you beat the dog and your a brutal leader, the dog will not have any self confidence. It'll be a broken dog. You can do that with human beings too. Yeah. If you bark at your people and you break them down all the time, they won't be able to stand up.

Speaker 6:          00:52:27       Another way to do that in a more lower, or should I say less brutal way, is to do everything for him for sure. Same thing meant no easy myself. Like

Speaker 1:          00:52:37       yeah, if you're setting the table all the time, yeah. Your daughter never realizes that she has the capability of doing that, handling that job. She's tying shoes, carrying backpacks, like all that, you know, everything. It's like man, if you're helping your kids, you're hurting your kids. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:52:54       And it's, yeah. And that clarifies it even more and it's so true. I mean, once you kind of latch on to that idea, you just see it everywhere. Like men, you ever see these kids? Like, I dunno, like a TV show or documentary type, whether in, I don't know, somewhere in Asia or some village where the four year old girl goes and kills a snake, skins it and then walks like in the mud for another mile back home, cooks it for their family, you know, like any like, Dang, that girl's for. Yeah. And she can do like, I can't even do that stuff, you know, kind of thing. It's a man

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       can put it into perspective where it's like these are kids who are just like making it happen. I'm beings are so adaptable. Like you see the little gymnast kids, they're six years old, iron cross, there's crazy do an athletic feats that are just insane. And why is that? Well, because they were put in that position. Yeah. And and train hard now some of those, some of that, sometimes those kids trained a little bit too hard I think. So they lose, they can lose other aspects of their life. But Dang, if you wouldn't like to be able to do an iron cross when I was six years old, come on now. Yeah, the point still told you remains. Yes, exactly right. So let your kids develop and let your subordinates develop. Give them responsibility, build them up back to the book. Moreover, it is important to realize that while men are dependent on the word of the leader, they are capable of much independent action on their own and are even capable of making their own decisions.

Speaker 1:          00:54:23       So this is kind of, this is kind of funny, right? It's Monte basically saying, look, I've got a little surprise for you. We'll surprise your troops. Can actually think for themselves. Yeah. Imagine that. And so obviously this is, this is decentralized command, right? This is it. And you have to let your subordinate leaders lead. He goes on to say, British soldiers have much native character in individuality. What is required is that the leader shall give the initial and vital decisions along with which the men can work. So yes, and you know what? This is actually, I'm glad that glad that money said it and that kind of funny way. It's the same thing that we're talking about with kids where you think, oh, well my kids probably not capable of doing that. Your kid is capable of doing that. Your kid can go out there and kill a snake and bring it back and skin it and cook it. You just have to allow them the, the, the room to, to let that happen and give them the authority. Empowered them to do it. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:55:22       Fully in that. It's so night and day to the other actually last night. Oh, I wasn't making chicken. Yeah, making chicken and I usually make rice in Hawaii, make rice with everything anyway, so I'm like, okay, make the Eggo. Hey, I tell my daughter she's six again. By the way, I was like, hey, make the rice. Here's the thing. I showed her how to make rice maker Rice isn't hard, but it's not like, I mean in most some steps. Yeah, there's some stuff for sure it and it wasn't, well for me anyway, before I taught her how to make rice, it wasn't real obvious that a six year old should be making rice, you know, like not in a rice cooker too, by the way. Just like on the stove regular. Um, but I thought at that point I was like, hey, why can't I just show her how and teacher how even if I don't teach her in one day, okay. The next time we make rice, which is just going to be soon, I'll, we'll go over it again kind of thing. Why should she not know how to make rice right now? Why should I have to do this for her or whatever. Anyway, I teach her, I tell her to make her rice super simple. Boom. Last night was the first time where

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       it was her responsibility to make rice. She makes rice six years old, makes rice boom boom. But you know what? Our current in the right direction. Exactly right. That's the point is too is that you as a leader, as leaders, the same thing. You let your let your guys run the operation, let your troops step up and take control of something that you and your egotistical maniac mind think only your people do it. Guess what? Your boys can get it done too. And if they, if they bat of 88 instead of a hundred cool, next time they're going to get a 92 and then I'm after that, they're going to get a 96 yeah. Cause that's a big obstacle to right. Mentally it's kind of like sure I could teach him how to do it, but why would I? Well yeah, you see that, you see that even more.

Speaker 4:          00:57:07       Is he in parenting? It's like, cool, my kid couldn't make the rice but in, in a team environment, our ego, our ego flares up because we want to be the one. Right. Yeah. Especially if you can do it at a 10 yeah. Guys only do at an eight at the end of the day and your job is done and you feel, you feel like that's your little power. You know, that's my little power. It's like well you know, you really know how to do is I'm going to come to, I better come down and check out how your bag, you're prepping this stuff cause you know, you know I'm kind of the man your yacht, that's where it is. Yeah. Kind of like when you like let's say they had to like screw on some stuff or okay I used to work at a moving company.

Speaker 4:          00:57:44       Right. You know this and at the end you load up the crates and you put them on the truck and you have to tie in with a certain kind of not right. You learn how to tie that. Not the kind that's super tight, but you, all you gotta do is pull one string together. Yeah. Cool little thing. So I learned how right and yeah, one of the the supervisor or whatever he Blake, yeah, go tie it off or whatever and I could totally do it. We've been doing this for a or whatever and then, but he'll go and he'll check in and he'll like, and then he'll pull it just a little bit more, you know, like as it's be like the little signature on it, a signature from the mass. He would just say what you're doing right there. But we do that all the time.

Speaker 4:          00:58:17       We like to have our own little rice bowls. Tika Rice, right? Sure. That's a weird term. But you've heard that term before, right? Like it, hey, you want somebody messing with his rice bowl? Meaning like this is mine. Like, Oh, I'm the guy that does this part of the job and I don't want anyone else to know how to do it. That's my little rice ball. Stay out of my rice bowl. There's a lot of rice bowls. I was never into that. Well at least, at least once I was actually in leadership positions, I was very, I'm, I'm not, I don't care. Like, oh, you're good. You come on, come on and grab some of this rights. Because if you can, if you can take my rice ball from me, guess what? I can go find another rice bowl. I'll bring it in here and we'll start. We'll have more rice. That's good man. Because it's not as intuitive, you know? Everyone thinks that. Everyone thinks that they're, everyone leans towards, Hey, I want to be the guy. Yeah. The ego flares up back to the book. Good morale can be created in a narrow sphere by a good leader, but a platoon or company has obviously influenced by the general feelings existing in a division or army. So now we're talking, so you got multiple

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       layers, multiple layers above the platoon or the company. You've got the army, you know the division. Good morale implies confidence in the high command and in the plan and he capitalized plan the plan. A strong leader on a high level can have a powerful influence on the general attitude of the men. Have a platoon. He cannot, however, influence their movements over the last flute, few vital yards of an attack. On the other hand, a strong leader on the low level can make as men carry out a single fine attack, but he cannot sustain their morale indefinitely. If there is a lack of confidence in the high command and it's planned, that's a challenge. It's a challenge if your troops, if your troops are looking at the strategy going, what the hell are we doing? Like you can get the guys through one attack or two, three missions, but eventually they were saying, hey, what's going on? Why are we doing this? This doesn't make any sense and vice versa. A leader cannot do without discipline.

Speaker 3:          01:00:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:27       You were thinking about when I say discipline on the podcast, you should put some little, every time I say it, especially when I say something like this, a leader cannot do without discipline, is aim must be to create such a discipline body of men that all his orders will be obeyed instantly. This habit of obeying leaders, orders must be so instilled into his men that they will carry on and fight, even though he himself falls. There's a problem with for that statement right there, right? The aim, this aim cannot be achieved without discipline. The second factor of morale is discipline. So a couple things here. First of all, I don't want my team to instantly obey all my borders without question. If I tell them to do something stupid, I actually want them to tell me no.

Speaker 1:          01:01:22       On top of that, if you think for one minute that all your people do is obey you, that when you die, they're just going to suddenly sprout leadership skills and start leading. You're wrong. You have to. You have to raise them in a way and treat them in a way that they are being challenged as leaders themselves, and they're being allowed to lead in. They're stepping up and leading it, and they're not waiting to instantly obey everything you do. Because if you're, if all you're doing is waiting for orders, you're not being proactive. You're not leading. Decentralized Command isn't happening. And if something happens to me, you're going to freeze. So this little section from Monte, no, I don't like it. Discipline is something that is important. You have to understand that you have to have discipline, standard operating procedures. You have to have discipline to stay within those procedures.

Speaker 1:          01:02:10       But on top of that you have to have the, the freedom to when those procedures aren't working to say, hey boss, this isn't a good, here's what we should do instead. Hmm. Now does this mean you and I are going to have a debate in the middle of a firefight over what the plan is? No, because we work together. We trust each other. You know what I'm coming from, I know where you're coming from and when I make a call you're going to do it. And by the way, if you make a call, even though I'm senior to you, if you make a call, guess what I'm going to do? Get someone to do follow. Yes, I'm going to follow you if you like. Hey Jocko, punch. Right? Get ready to fight these guys. And I'm the senior guy. But you just told me to do that.

Speaker 1:          01:02:50       Guess what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna support you. So that's, that's what you want. Um, you, you have to be careful because as people, if you have someone who's personality is sensitive to that, yeah. Right? And you say, Hey Jocko, to try give, give them, get on their flank. And my response is, excuse me a minute, just heard, do you think you are actually, I'm in charge of this platoon. Why don't you just lock it up? We're not going to punch. Right. And we're actually gonna move. You know what I mean? That's what we can get into that situation all day long. Guess what's going to happen to all of us? We're all going to die. So we have to figure that stuff out. We have to figure out that, that we have to work together. But at the end, one of us has to submit to the situation to submit to the other person's leadership.

Speaker 1:          01:03:43       And by the way, there's 16 people in a platoon. In a seal platoon, there's 30 or 40 in an infantry platoon, it's pretty easy to get in the habit of like, Hey, when the boss speaks, we're all gonna submit to what he's saying. Oh, if the one of my platoon sergeant speaks, okay, well he barks out something, guess what? We'll submit to that. Occasionally someone else will rise up and see something. We have to, we have to work and train together so that we know when we need to submit to someone else or when we, or when we need to say, hey, negative, we're not doing that. We're going over here. These are, these are challenging things, right? It's think of how easy for think of how easy it is to, to have the Monte attitude and be really easy for me to say right now.

Speaker 1:          01:04:25       Like, Hey, listen, this is what happens. You'd have to have your men. So discipline when you tell them to do something, they do it. That's the easiest solution, right? That, okay, great. Talk was put out the word, oh, by the way, if I get hurt, fall the guy that's in the second chain of command. Okay, cool. That's easy. That's an easy day. Right now we're going to win every time. No wrong cause guess what? Occasionally me, I'm the leader. I'm going to make a bad decision and somebody needs to check me. Now are you gonna check me every single time? No you're not. Are you going to check me? He, you know what? We're going to work together so much that if you think you know what, I'm not sure jock was making the right call, but at least I'm going to start to execute it.

Speaker 1:          01:04:59       I'm going to keep a heads up on to move forward and then if I see what I think might be a problem happening, I'm going to say something, but my response out of the gate is we're going to go. That's the kind of thing that's going on here. This is a dynamic environment interacting of human beings. It's freaking challenging, but to blanket everyone when I tell you to do something, you do it. Yeah. I want instant obedience to everything that I say. Again, that works great. 94% of the time, 6% of the time it's an utter disaster. And everyone dies. So we don't want to allow for that. We want to allow some flexibility in there. That is harder to do. It's harder to have that flexibility. It's much more challenging, but it gives you such better capability and survivability that that's how you want to set it up.

Speaker 1:          01:05:46       It takes a lot more. That's why. That's why the more advanced you get in, the more tactically advanced you get, the more there is of that. So if you go to a marine corps, infantry platoon, they're going to have less pushback and less, they're going to have more obedience, more just straight wrote obedience as they should. Because guess what, an 18 year old marine, it doesn't have as much knowledge as a 25 year old staff sergeant like aura or the platoon commander that went to the basic school and he's right. So there's, you're going to have these situations that are going to was so in a, in a normal infantry platoon, there's going to be less pushback. You get into a seal platoon, well now you've got a bunch of experience guys. Just about everyone there has a few pumps. The new guys aren't going to say anything, but the guys with two or three platoons, they're going to say, hey, boss, not a good call.

Speaker 1:          01:06:36       Or they're going to give you some pushback. Why? Because you've got a more experienced fueled of people, so it takes more practice to get that, to get to be able to interact together properly and have that flowing chain of command that's docile and and can and can't expand and contract and can move from one person to the next dynamically as a mission is happening. I mean, there's times in in close quarters combat where basically there's a, there's a person at the front of the train and that person rotates out every few seconds. There's tactical situations where there's a new person making the calls every 10 seconds. Think about that. That's tough. That's radical. To have a new person making a call every 10 or 15 seconds, there's a new person doing it. How do you do that? Well, they understand. Everyone understands. They understand the tactics, they understand how we work together.

Speaker 1:          01:07:26       That's what we want. As opposed to there's only one person that can make the call. That's just centralized command. So again, it's very, it's hard for me to, to, to uh, throw this out there, right? Cause I don't want an 18 year old marine thinking whoa unified funnel. Like what the platoon commander says. I'm just going to tell them no, that's not what I'm saying. Not what I'm saying. I do want you to think, yeah, I do want you as an 18 year old marine to think, I want you to be understanding what decisions being made to the best of your ability. And yes, if you see something happening that is absolutely not good and you know it, you're damn right. You should speak up and your platoon commanders should be happy that you're speaking up. But if you're a guy that's going to speak up every time a decision gets made because you think maybe of a different way, that might be a little bit better in your mind, you're going to suffer the consequences of number one, the whole platoon being indecisive. And number two, your boss going to tell you to shut up, cause your, your idea that might be 8% better than his idea. We don't have time to discuss that right now, so unless you see something that's real significant, yeah, shut up and do what you're told. If you see something that's really significant, okay. Hey, boss, negative. Can't do that. There you go.

Speaker 3:          01:08:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:40       The second factor, discipline. The object of disciplines is the conquest of fear press. This is new perspective for me that the reason we have discipline is to conquer fear. It's interesting, right? Factually true to what is it that gets you to do that thing that you're afraid of? You have the discipline to just drive through it adequately to determine the best method of doing this requires an analysis of fear to be made. There are two aspects of fear. Fear can suddenly attack a man through his imagination. A corpse in a ditch or a grave by the side of the road will remind him of the peril of his position. He will suddenly realize that he himself is liable to be killed.

Speaker 1:          01:09:27       It is a function of discipline to fortify the mine so that so that it becomes reconciled to unpleasant sites and accepts them as normal everyday occurrences. Fear can also creep in upon a man during periods of monotony in the line. So this is the other type of fear. There's two types, right? The one that just jumps on you and the other one is, is creeps on you at such a time. He will have the opportunity to appreciate the dangers which pacet his life. Fear acting through his thoughts can so reduce a man's hard core of courage that he will become nervous and fearful. Discipline strengthens the mind so that it becomes impervious to the corroding influence of fear. It teaches men to confine their thoughts within certain definite limits. Kate instills the habit of self control. Keep your emotions in check, keep your fear and check that requires discipline. The basis of fear is the awareness of danger in itself. This is healthy

Speaker 1:          01:10:29       for a man who is aware of danger, automatically take steps to provide against it. It is only when fear dominates the mind that it becomes unhealthy and leads to panic. So fear is good. We know that fear is healthy. We know that until you let it dominate your mind and then it's a problem. Men must be urged to fight fear with courage so that they will advance or defend and not take refuge in fight and flight or inaction. Man Becomes aware of when man becomes aware of danger, when he feels himself opposed to something more powerful than himself.

Speaker 1:          01:11:03       Right? Man Becomes aware of danger when he feels himself opposed to something more powerful than himself. In other words, when he feels that his own armor min is unequal to that of the enemy who oppose him, it is important for a man to lose his individual feeling and to become an integral part of the battalion, division and army to which he belongs. The larger the unit of which he feels himself to be a member of the larger will be the estimation of his own armament and the less will be his fear. It is here that discipline shows its value for it can help a man to lose his own identity and become a part of a larger, stronger unit. It is in this way that discipline will conquer fear.

Speaker 1:          01:11:52       Got to relate to that bigger group. You see this in like gang fights, the one person by themselves as a coward, but then when they have 10 of their friends, all of a sudden they're courageous. It's a horrible example, but it's a reality, right? It's a total reality. Yeah. I used to see that in the streets, the street back in the day, like, yeah. You know, like one person, myself included, you know, your two or three of us. Okay, we're a little bit, we got a little, uh, we got a little, a little froggy, right? But when there's 18 of us, all of a sudden you're real tough, right? That's me. When I was 15 years old, oh, I'm super tough with all my friends. Right? Bad. It's a bad example, but it's the reality and I liked it. Big scraps. This corporate sense, which discipline creates, helps men face the unknown. At night. Men in the line become afraid of the unknown, which stretches out in front of them at all times in action. They are afraid of new and terrifying weapons which may be used against them. They realize that these unknown quantities may bring danger to them. Their ability to face these dangerous is immensely strengthened by feeling themselves to be part of a group. The group is known and a certain quantity which they feel is strong enough to stand up to the unknown, dangerous with surround them in numbers.

Speaker 1:          01:13:20       The method by which the conquest of fear is achieved is the unifying of men into a group or unit under obedience to orders. So he rolls right back to obedience to orders. Monte does, and part of the reason is he's talking about conscripts a lot. Draftees, not volunteers. So there's a little bit of uh, that's what, that's what he's dealing with now, as we know from hack and from General Mooka Yama like, Hey, if you treat your people right, doesn't matter that the draftees men required to be United if they are to give of their best discipline seeks to instill into all ranks a sense of unity by compelling them to obey orders as one man. This obedience to orders is the indispensable condition of good discipline. Men Learn to gain confidence and encouragement from doing the same thing as their fellows. They drive and satisfaction from their company, their own identities become merged into the larger, stronger identity of the unit.

Speaker 1:          01:14:18       You know what's interesting is I'll go, I'll even go a little bit more hardcore against Monte. Uh, you know what to me is an exceptional unit is the unit where you don't even have to give orders where you just, where everyone knows what the intent is. Or you give them a lay of looks like, hey, this is the intent and people to do what they're supposed to do with no orders. Yeah. That's what you really want. You know, there's, uh, a chapter that Lafe wrote where he's talking about prioritize and execute and he's talking about how it's when one of our guys fell through the roof, they were on a mission. They were an Overwatch. They ended up having to conquer a sledge hammer through a concrete wall. And Lafe and I were talking about, he's like writing the chapter and he was going to talk about like what his priorities were and how he told the guys like, you know you do this, you do this.

Speaker 1:          01:15:13       And he's like, yeah, well the thing is I didn't tell anyone to do anything. And I was like, yeah, check. Cause his guys knew, oh wait, we've got this going on, we're going to set security, we're going to move like the, everyone knows what. That's what you want. And then what that allowed life to do is I think about, okay now bigger priorities and that's what he wrote about. But your troops, they shouldn't, you shouldn't even have to give them orders because they should be trained well enough to respond based on the situation and knowing and understanding the standard operating procedures and knowing very quickly what it is that your intent is as the leader. So all you need to say is set security and the guys get into position where they're supposed to go. That's how it should be. I'm not looking for, I'm not looking for obedience.

Speaker 1:          01:16:00       You know what I'm looking for. I'm looking for what we used to call thinking shooters. You know, I want a platoon full of thinking shooters, meaning that they're thinking for themselves, they're making things happen. They understand what it is that I want done, whether I said it to them or whether we pre-brief did or whether we've been through this, we've drilled it, but whatever. They know what it is that I want done and I want my team to be thinking this is decentralized command. When you get into just wrote obedience, we're losing the, the aspect of decentralized command. And as Monte said earlier, believe it or not, believe it or not, your man might be able to make some decisions on their own. It's like, yes, take that a lot, many, many steps further than that chick continuing on. Men must learn to obey orders when all their instincts cry out.

Speaker 1:          01:16:55       For them not to be obeyed. They must learn to obey orders in times of stress so that they will do so in times of danger. They must learn to carry out their tasks under any condition. And despite all difficulties in this way, mass of loose individuals with their fears and weaknesses can be welded together into a United whole ready to act on the word of the leader. So again, what I'm saying is I don't want them ready to act on the word of the leader. I want them ready to act on the fault of the leader.

Speaker 5:          01:17:30       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:17:31       Discipline helps men to display fortitude in the face of fatigue and discomfort while at the same time it helps them conquer fear. It enables them uncomplainingly to triumph over difficulties which would have overcome them in times of peace. This constancy in enduring hardship and fatigue is the quality which is most frequently required of a soldier, individual fortitude and corporate courage or the twin products of discipline. So there we get. That's the, that's the just straight positive aspects of discipline that, that I think of, hey, things are going to be, we're gonna be tired. Whatever, discomfort, whatever, fear, whatever. We have discipline, discipline, cockers, all those things. Discipline implies a conception of duty. Nothing will be accomplished in the crisis of by man without a sense of duty. The century in and outpost holds his ground in the face of an attack because he has a sense of duty to those behind him. This sense is instilled by discipline because it teaches men to obey orders as a matter of course, to know that it is wrong not to obey them and right that it is their duty to do so

Speaker 1:          01:18:41       for the soldier. This conception of duty does not embrace abstractions such as freedom or empire or democracy in battle. A soldier's sense of duty extends only to the friends who are around him and is the job of the junior leader to encourage this sense of duty. Abstractions are the sphere of a politician, so he goes real extreme in this one and we all have heard this before. Hey, when you're in combat, you're not fighting for this political ideology. You're fighting for the man to your left and your right. Absolutely true, absolutely true. I would say, well, I know that it's not just that you have to you you at. When, when the immediate battles over, you need to look and say, okay, well why are we doing this? Oh, we're doing this because we believe in our cause. So to me it's both. You can't just cast out, you know, in my opinion, abstractions are the sphere of politicians. No troops need to believe in what they're doing.

Speaker 1:          01:19:41       A certain type of training may induce men to go forward in an attack simply out of fear of the consequences of not doing. So. This applies only to the weakest and most feeble of men who are of little value in battle. This type of training is an essential part of discipline, but it's never be misty to be mistaken for the hole. So he kind of goes one way and then the other it's like, yeah, sometimes you're just going to have to, you have to make people do what you want to do because they're afraid of you or they're afraid of the consequences. If you have to lead through fear, if you, if you, if you, if your team is doing something only because they're afraid of the consequences, that's a losing battle. Yell. It's a losing the war, right? You might win the battle, but you're not going to win the war. Continuing on the type of training mentioned in the preceding paragraph, which implies a certain harshness and hardness has its value. Material comforts are now so insidious that there is some danger that this is the old fashioned idea of disciplined and it will be allowed to disappear. This must not happen. Soldiers will not win battles if their training has not been hard.

Speaker 1:          01:20:55       That's a little less than for your entire life. Soldiers will not win battles if their training has not been hard. The softening influences of civilian life must be replaced by the exacting demands of military training.

Speaker 3:          01:21:08       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:21:09       Soldiers must forget the pleasures of peace and concentrate on the realities of war. Isn't it funny that this, this could be written right now and some of the WHO, you know, training is getting easier and all that and tech that we always think that got to keep it hard. He always get, always get to fight against the slippery slope of things. Getting easier in brief discipline seeks to conquer fear by welding men into a cohesive whole unit. United by obedience to orders. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:21:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:21:38       No, I'm not with you. Money. It aims to create a body strong enough to carry each of its members through dangers and difficulties which they themselves would be unable to face alone. In this way, it promotes comradeship, which is the third factor of morale. Okay? I much more important in my opinion than the blind obedience of orders. Morale, so we're talking about comradeship now. Morale cannot be good and less men have come unless men come to have affection for each other. A fellow feeling must grow up, which will result in a spirit of comradeship and army is made up of human beings so that however much at leader may inspire as men, however, perfect the discipline, morale will be hard and unsympathetic.

Speaker 3:          01:22:24       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:22:24       If the warmth of comradeship is not added to it, war, the hard business is not necessarily a grim one. Men Muscle Laugh and joke together must enjoy each other's company and must get fun out of life even in times of danger. Check this spirit of comradeship must begin at the section or tank crew level and work its way upward to army level. The importance of encouraging men to band together and identify themselves with their units has already been emphasized. This will be necessary to make considerable efforts to further this spirit of comradeship. Junior commanders must plan to create this spirit in the same way they plan to train their men and fire their weapons. Men must not be moved from unit to unit or even from platoon to platoon unless there's good reason for doing it and these reasons must be made clear to the men. A man who has served among friends in the same platoon for a long time will be helped by them to face the trials a battle he will feel around him. His reserves of courage and purpose upon which he can draw. There will be a feeling of solidarity and out of this feeling there were grow up, a determination to advance together and defend together and even die together

Speaker 1:          01:23:40       in wartime. With such heavy casualties and constant reinforcements, it is always found that comp, this comradeship can be built up most quickly by ensuring that new arrivals as reinforcements belonged to the part of Britain from which the unit is originally drawn. And to which it belongs in peacetime. So that's what, uh, you've got to have your team join together. And then he's saying, look, if you've got new reinforcements coming in, and they came from Darbyshire and there is a unit from Barbara shirts, sent them to go work with the guys from Darbyshire. They already have a connection.

Speaker 1:          01:24:14       Comradeship is, and you know who didn't do that? The Soviets, the Soviet Union was famous for not doing that because they didn't want there to be a really strong unity in the, in the forces because then that unity might turn into, you know, a movement. So they didn't want that. They would, they would notoriously split everyone up. You would never be with a guy from your home town, you know, they'd split everyone up. This is the opposite of that. Comradeship is based on affection and trust, which between them produce an atmosphere of mutual goodwill and feeling of interdependence. Men Learn to have faith in each other and to depend on each other according to the abilities of each in a tank crew, gun team, or infantry section. Men do not work well together merely because they are disciplined and well led. They do so because they trust each other and because they are bound together by an affection which has never expressed in words, but shown itself. Indeed's comradeship is a great antidote to fear because it gives a man friends, a man must take friends. A man must make friends in his platoon, friends whom he respects and admires in battle. These friends will prevent him from feeling lonely. A man alone is a man who will find it hard to stand up to the dangers of the line. A man alone is a man afraid if he has to be. If he has friends, he will derive strength from their presence and he will be anxious not to let them down in battle.

Speaker 1:          01:25:44       You will seek to do his fair share of all tasks which come to his crew or section. He will feel ashamed if he cannot assist his friends in their duties and maintain his place with them. In the line,

Speaker 1:          01:25:57       all men have, uh, within them. A touch of, of streak, of generosity and unselfishness, a touch of nobility and these qualities will be brought out in the attitude to their friends. Friendship Causes Men's to Gi causes men to give their best. So you know what, I guess we started talking about this a little bit in the beginning. If you're not, if you don't want to be a part of the team, you are going to miss this whole section of what makes a unit to have high morale. If we're not friends that hurts our morale. So you know, they have these, these things and the uh, the rangers do a really good job of it. You can peer someone out, meaning we as peers can, can look at someone that we don't like or that doesn't want to be a part of the team and we can get rid of them.

Speaker 1:          01:26:54       So it's called peering someone out. We don't really the, there's not an official system in the seal teams. Like you can do it, but it's like, it's a little bit case by case. So in the in ranger school, and forgive me Rangers if I don't get this a hundred percent right, but basically you have to rank your, you have to rank everyone in your patrol. So you've got 20 guys in your patrol, you ranked, this guy was number one, meaning performance wise, this guy was number one, this guy was number 20 if you're number 20 like a multiple times in a row, three times zero or something, they kick you out. So what we have to do is we have to work together as a team and say, okay, you know what? It's my turn to be the last guy. So put me as number 20 okay. Jocularity from to put you in 20 okay, cool.

Speaker 1:          01:27:33       Next time it's going to be echo. Next time it's going to be built, next time it's going to be Mike. So that way we all want to stay. What we have to do is we have to coordinate work together to rank ourselves accordingly. So it's real easy if none of us like echo three lazy just to put echo at the bottom three patrols in a row and you're gone in the basic seal training, we don't really have a system like that. It takes a little bit more, you have to be a little bit more proactive because it's not just an existing thing. Uh, we did have a, my seal training class, we had one guy that we basically peered out, like my officers, you know, got feedback from everyone and said this guys shouldn't be here. And they went up to the instructors and the instructors got rid of him.

Speaker 1:          01:28:14       So it happens. But it doesn't happen in a quite that official way. And the only reason it wasn't performance and was like, Hey, this guy doesn't, for lack of a better word, and this doesn't sound real good in this politically correct world that we live in now you get someone that doesn't fit in. Yeah. Right. Like this guy just doesn't fit in. Cool. We're going to get rid of him because we don't want to have someone on the team that's not, that doesn't want to be part of the team. Yeah. And believe me, this happens very seldom. Like you've gotta be a real, you've got to fit in in a real bit, not fitting in a real big way to stand out in a, with a crowd of seals. There's all kinds of different guys. Yeah. So can I heard, it seems like anyway that you could do that. Like in a roommate situation it'd be less official. Like you're talking about a system. What? That it's sort official, like you said,

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       hey, the ranger like, yeah, like you say, Hey, let's just wait. What's the ranking based on, on the ranger thing? Well, they're saying, hey, echo did a great job on this patrol. I rank it was in the number one guy on this patrol. Jocko was number 16 so he's number 16 and, and bill was horrible and he's number 20 right. You do that every patrol you go on. So wait till it, let's say that we weren't gonna phase anybody out or pour or, so they went out and what we would do is we would just rotate. Hey, I'm, I'm the bottom guy this time. Okay. Echo. You wouldn't really perform at the bottom necessarily. Oh, just on the record. You have to force rank everyone and so you rank k we're just going to rotate who's the bottom one. So none of us get it eliminated.

Speaker 4:          01:29:38       Gotcha. And then, yeah, yeah, it's weird. I thought what you meant by peer someone out, which kind of might even be the same thing in a way where let's say you have three roommates are full of say four roommates and they were like, hey this guy, he's not fitting in and he snores or I don't know, whatever. And you know how roommates we're friends typically right when you room with someone. Um, and then after a while you just sorta like not invite that one friend all the time and sort of peer, I'm out peer, I'm out like, yeah, like just more than anything. I mean in a nutshell. Basically you just make his experience with the group just a little less enjoyable. So he sorta on his own just sorts of phase himself out and find some new friends. Yeah. You know, just slowly, just naturally kind of thing where you're just like, hey bro, where peer and you out.

Speaker 4:          01:30:25       Don't tell him. I mean, I guess you could break, you know when you break up with your friend, you ever had to do that? Where you going to be late? I'm a dude. No, no, no. Not breaking up with Kitson expression. It's an expression like where you know how you ever had a friend who's like, they want to be your friend and everything, but man, being friends with this person has just kind of too much every day you read that. First of all, I don't have a lot of people that want to be friends with me and I don't have a lot of the long list anyways, so I really haven't had that APP Bruh. It like, I dunno, like if your friend, every time you go somewhere with them he gets in arguments with people or gets in fights or, or like, I don't know, you know, the kind of guy is he is just too much token friend with and you've got to break up with him or he just calls you too much. Oh, neat. You know, like that kind of friend anyway. Sometimes you guys don't have a lot of, this is making me feel real lonely over here. I don't have it does. Maybe. Maybe you're the one who that phased out. I got phased out across the board over the past 47 years. Phased out. Could be red. You're too intense. You're too intense with your point, Jocko. He's going to be all fired up for this. Yeah, we can't drink around him because that's weird how people think. They can't drink around you.

Speaker 4:          01:31:36       Some people do, but no, no. I'm pretty mellow about it. You know something. She tried to get peered out over here a year or two later. Anybody. You're peered out. But there's some people I think feel internally guilty. Right. So they don't want me around because they know like, oh well, um, I want to get, I want to do horrible things tonight to my body. Right. And if I have Jocko having to

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       feel guilty about it. Yeah. Yeah. It might be judged or that's what it is. I think they think, oh, judging. Always judging. It's funny cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm saying that sarcastically. I kind of really don't care. Yeah. I don't think you've even indicated that you cared, like not even in a little bit. Yeah. Little Way. It's funny. Yeah. And, and actually I think, I don't like to indicate, because then the person might tighten their track up a little bit, then they're going to be like tougher to deal with on the maths of justice. The whole plans. I mean, I'm bringing donuts Bro. Today I have some of these work out. So yes, I think it's a good system that the, that the rangers have it. And I'm, like I said, we have an unofficial methodology and certainly once you get it to a seal team, there's the same thing can happen.

Speaker 1:          01:32:46       Right. You get a guy that just doesn't quote unquote fit in and that's a real thing. And like I said, it's a real broad spectrum. Like there's very few people that I know that I know or that I've saw got peered out. I don't think I ever, I think we might appeared out one guy in like my second or third platoon, we actually had a guy that was just like, yeah, you really just don't belong here. And you know, the idea was like, hey, we need to, and what'll happen is the noodle probably get some safety violations, which is, by the way, what, what will, one of the reasons why a guy's going to get paired out. Like, Hey, this guy just doesn't, can't keep it together in the house. You know what I mean? That's not good. We don't want them here. So yeah, you don't want you, because I think it's because it's not like anyone not like anyone that says, well you know, comradeship is a real important part of morale and morale is very important on the battlefield.

Speaker 1:          01:33:37       We never said that, but you feel it an opportunity. You've got some guy that just doesn't fit in. Yeah, I can see how that can be, especially with you guys in the teams where it matters. It matters like way more, you know? It's not like you're, you know, at the, in my case as a mover, you're going little cruise, you know, and it's like, man, it's just way less at stake, you know, being like a coat or a bit less and stay a little bit different. But yeah. So it makes sense man. It totally does. Yeah, it's end again. I don't want people freaking out, but I will say this. What was it? I was going to college when I was going to college and I was out of the seal teams for a little while and this one of my professors was, you know, like, you know, it must be so nice to just be going to college.

Speaker 1:          01:34:28       And I'm like, no, it's hell. I want to go back to the teams immediately right now, this minute, because in this professor's mind, you know, she's thinking, oh gosh, think of how wonderful this must be ta here and being educated and learning and expanding your brain and you don't have to do all that hard military stuff with guns. And meanwhile, I'm literally the exact opposite. I don't want to do a knee thing at college and I want to go back to the teams immediately. And I said, no, I w I, if I could go back right now, I would immediately give me an f and every class, if they let me go back and still be but still be in the teams, I'd do it. And she goes, why is it that you liked so much about it? And I said, well, everyone kind of like me.

Speaker 1:          01:35:14       You know, you're hanging around with a bunch of guys that are kind of like you. Not Exact, but like they have the same mindset. They laugh at the same jokes. There's, they have the, you know, it's like just a bunch of similar type of people, which of course that's who you want to hang around with it. You want to hang around with a bunch of people that are the opposite of you. Now. You're not hanging around with like, hey this person's nothing. This person is different than me that, oh, I don't want to hear their input. No, I actually, I like getting different people's input but there's a nice kind of solid base of like, Hey, you're a team guy on the team guy and we kind of have the same kind of just broad life perspective and that's nice to have and it doesn't really matter where you came from because in the teams you get all kinds of people from all kinds of different backgrounds, right?

Speaker 1:          01:35:57       You get guys from Hawaii, you get guys from the, from the ghetto, you get guys from the farm, you get guys from the city, you get guys for you guys from everywhere. And yet all those differences are like surface differences. But the core dude, it's pretty much like this dude. You know what I mean? Like we're all pretty similar. It doesn't matter what, you know, kind of how you grew up or what race you are or what religion you are. It's like, oh yeah, disfigured. He's a team guy. So we, we kind of get it. I kinda, I know what you're thinking and you know what I'm thinking. And that's kind of cool to be around. And that is part of comradeship and that is part of what makes a unit tight. And when there's an person that doesn't, then that's, that's problematic and it's not just problematic. It's problematic for the team starts to hurt morale.

Speaker 6:          01:36:48       Yeah. It's weird. Not Weird, but in football it's the same thing but it's not the whole team though. People gather in positions like the wide receiver, in my case, all the wide receivers, same deal. They all come from different places. Hawaii guys, mainland guys, different part, you know, just saw such different people. But for some reason there are, they all just sort of gravitate towards each other. You know when you go to the cafeteria or wherever you go, like in football camp you see, you can tell a lot by where people sit there on the Caterpillar's. Yay. Yeah, the quarterbacks. I'll sit over there behind benders and it's so interesting given this concept that you're talking about where you would think most of the people from a certain area, maybe a certain race would gather together and there is some of that for sure. But for the most part it's, it's sorts of sorts itself out by position. It's like you see sort of the linemen and kind of go over there and you know the receivers are kind of like over here. Yeah. And it doesn't matter like w there where they come from or their little background or whatever because there's this underlying interest that they all sort of share

Speaker 1:          01:37:52       know core, like a core part of their personality. That's the same and that's I guess the key thing here. Get that core part of your personality that's the same and some fundamental characteristics of the good team guy. You know, like there's a fundamental like, hey, this guy is going to work hard. Hey, this guy's going to take care of his gear, is going to take care of the platoon. Gary's going to knock it out, not looking out for himself. That's it's like a real, the real problem. Like if you're a yeah, you don't want to be that guy. And so if you have those, you know, then it doesn't really matter what you're like. Whatever you layer on top of that, it's fine, it's fine. No one cares, no one cares. Check. Next section. The fourth factor is self respect. No Man can be said to possess high morale if the quality of self respect is lacking, soldiers must be encouraged to respect themselves at all times under all conditions.

Speaker 1:          01:38:49       This quality is involved with those of discipline and comradeship to such an extent that it is perhaps wrong and certainly difficult to separate them, but no man will have high morale who does not possess a greater quality, greater and wider than comradeship and discipline. Self respect implies a determination to maintain personal standards of behavior. A man who respects himself will neither allow himself to become slovenly nor his quarters dirty, right? This is this, this is the root of, you know, the stereotypical, uh, adult saying to the kid, don't you have any self perspective? How could you walk around looking like that? How could you wear that? How could you grow your hair like that? How could you, you know, like all those things, how could you live in this pig sty, right? It's all those things boil down to self respect.

Speaker 1:          01:39:51       Even in action, he will take care to see that his personal appearance suffers as little as possible. Montes, a bit of a friction eastern, I think representing that baret that's Monte. It is the job of the NCO to maintain this aspect of discipline. It is the function of the officer to encourage and instill self respect. So once again, who's, who's instilling self respect? It's the leaders and how do they do that? So the little things that we just talked about, I believe you instill self respect by doing things you just talked about, which is giving people responsibility, letting them figure out jobs themselves, letting them do things. Here's how Monte wants to do it. The officer must've ruthlessly insist on maintenance of personal standards.

Speaker 1:          01:40:41       And then he says this, this is why you gotta. You know, Montes coming off hard, but here we go. At the same time, however, he must let his men understand that he appreciates and respects them. As human beings, soldiers must be treated with humanity and controlled by discipline. So there's a, there's a balance in his dichotomy here, right treat, treat them good, but controlling by discipline, but treat them good. So he's got a dichotomy here. If the officer does this, he will gain the respect of his mandarin at the same time he gives them self-respect. Efficiency is inseparable from self respect. The sense of a good job, well done, have a hard task. Assessed with the accomplished is indispensable to good morale. Men must take pride in their ability to carry out all jobs allotted to them. They must feel that they are good soldiers and therefore a value to other people. That's a good little, good little thing to sprinkle in. Especially kids, right? Yeah. Like making you ever been around kids that have been told, you know, that they're worthless their whole lives. Like that's not, it's a horrible sight. And what do they not have? They don't have self respect. Men can be persuaded of this fact by being trusted.

Speaker 1:          01:41:51       A man who feels he is trusted, will feel that he's efficient and will you will at once begin to respect myself. This is like critical leaders. I mean subordinates, kids, either one. When you start giving them that trust, like your daughter's not old enough, but eventually you're gonna be saying, Hey, you're gonna stay at home. I'm gonna be gone for about a half an hour going to the store. Right. And she's going to like stand up a little straighter. Cause it's like all of a sudden that's a big deal. Right? That's a big deal. Yeah. And that same thing happens with your subordinates. Hey listen, I'm going to be gone for a little bit. Hold down the fort. Yeah, you got this, they stand up a little bit straighter. Their self respect increases when you give them trust.

Speaker 2:          01:42:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:42:37       A man who feels he's trusted, a man who feel he's in trusted will feel that he is efficient and he will at once begin to respect himself. He will have confidence in his own ability to fight men who are trusted, gain self confidence. It is the job of the officer to convince his men that he trusts them. So once again, it's a leadership scenario, but it's so true.

Speaker 6:          01:42:57       Oh, I remember learning to drive my dad. That's a big one. Oh yeah. So He um, he first he taught, we learned on a manual transmission. Yeah. Are there any manual transmission studies? Hardly. Huh. Um, and it was a truck too, which is, it's just harder. I mean, in my experience, the one that we learned on, it wasn't that easy to do yet. And so we learned how to just do it, you know, just use the manual transmission for a second, third, fourth and um, but still not necessarily driving like on the streets. So the first time he told me to drive, like on the streets, I knew how to do the shift and all that. He just jumped in the um,

Speaker 2:          01:43:37       okay,

Speaker 6:          01:43:37       passenger seat and he put, you know, put me any suggested, take us there and we're going to, you know, where the store or whatever. And he was just like, take us there. It wasn't the kind of like, okay, now what you want to do is do you know, he, well it was nothing. It was, he just said straight up take us there. And I felt that, I felt that like drives are now, you know, and uh, Wayne and yeah, a little bit nerve wracking, but men way more confident than I would done being if you would've been like, okay, be sure to check your mail, check your mirrors. Okay. Easy. You know, like that kind of stuff. None of that. He just said,

Speaker 1:          01:44:06       take us there. Yep. Boom. I took us there. It was good. I liked it. You know, dropping knowledge. Then check self-respect as a quality which will develop inevitably if the three essential factors already considered our presence. It is true to say that without self respect, good morale is impossible, is equally true. To say that if the standards of leadership, discipline and comradeship are high, the quality of self respect will also be high. So this all boils down to leadership. Additional factor, devotion to a cause. It is impossible to make a d is impossible to make devotion to a cause, either a basic or contributory factor to good morale. It must stand by itself between these two categories. It is important to clear the mind of some misconceptions connected with the influence of a cause in shaping morale. Men do not fight primarily for a cause.

Speaker 1:          01:45:08       They do not have, they do not advance over dangerous ground in pursuit of an ideal they not now fight as crusaders may have done long ago. They fight because they are ordered to do so. And they do it well or badly according to the strength of various factors which have already been considered. So yeah, this is one that I'm, again, I'm not really, I'm not really down to down with Monte on this thing. I think if you've got troops that are new, have no idea why they're fighting and they're not fighting for a cause, you're going to have a breakdown. You know you're gonna have a breakdown in your units. As a matter of fact, he kinda said that. He said it earlier, he said if you don't have, remember this, if you don't have respect for the plan and this and the higher leadership, well that's what it causes is it causes like we have a plan, we have, we are higher leadership.

Speaker 1:          01:46:02       Who's that? That's the leaders of our country. That's the highest leadership. So if you don't, if you don't believe in that then you're going to have a problem. And then he says this and this again, this is a little arrogance coming from coming from Monte. This is not so in the case of leaders, some men fight some fight for the same reason as the men, the more intelligent because they have cause they add heart believe in what they fight for. Such leaders are using the best in the army and wheel. The greatest influence thus numerically cause is of little importance. But it is a powerful factor because the leaders are greatly influenced by it. So he's basically saying, listen, you know, the senior leaders have an understanding of the cause, and so whereas the men are just fighting because they're ordered. So he literally says that I had, come on Bro, that's not, that's, that's, that doesn't work.

Speaker 1:          01:46:51       That doesn't work in America. And you know, you talk like, look at that, that letter I read from the beginning. That's kind of why I wanted to read that letter as a con, as a contradiction to this. And as an, I mean, what he says in that letter is like, look, I'm not fighting for the great of England. He says that, but he's fighting for the cause that causes security for his family. Right. So people aren't thinking about that. You don't, you don't, you don't say, I'm willing to die just because some random dude ordered me to do it. No. You have to have a connection to something greater than that. Otherwise you're, you're suicidal, right? Yeah. Yeah. I remember saving private Ryan when he said that he, there's a movie. Yes,

Speaker 6:          01:47:37       he threw Tom Hanks. Right. He, uh, he was like, I don't know who Ryan, you know, they got to save private. Right. Obviously. And um, there at this part where they're kind of questioning things, you know, guys, morale is breaking down and you know, things happen. And what he says in part of his speech was like, Hey, I don't know who private Ryan is. I don't know him. So I basically questioning that particular cause. But he said, but if going and rescuing him earns me the right to get back to my family, then that's my mission. So same deal, same deal as the letter rates that he has. He had his caught soy. Yeah. And that was the one who was fighting for,

Speaker 1:          01:48:19       yeah, back to the book. Nevertheless, nothing which has been stated here must be interpreted as minimizing the influence of cause on those officers and men who are moved by it. So then he, he, he brings it back a little bit for these few cause we'll be a sustaining and strengthening factor in maybe of greater importance to them than any of the other four factors. There are times when a few men will be gripped by a cause and will perform astonishing deeds of heroism to further it. Such men do not require the ordinary bonds of discipline which unite and strength and others, their devotion to the cause is in itself all sufficient. Nor do they require the same kind of leader that has been described. They themselves will all be leaders. Such men may be properly described as guerrilla or irregular for fighters fanatically devoted to a political, religious or national ideal.

Speaker 1:          01:49:09       They must not be confused with conscript soldiers to whom this paper applies. So there you go. I mean in America, if you know we have all volunteer. Yeah, but I'm telling you even it doesn't matter if you've got it, you've people have to understand there has to be some kind of a deeper causes to what you're doing or else you're going to have real problems. Sure. You can order people if they're constructs and you can punish them if they don't do what you're going to tell. If they don't do what you tell them to do, you can punish them. That is a way, but that is not going to be a successful way. You know? That is not going to be the ideal way. And by way, if you're not using the ideal way, you may win. But if you're going against somebody that is using the ideal way, that has a cause that they believe in and on top of that, because they have all these other things, the the, the, the group that has a real cause will win every single time.

Speaker 1:          01:50:06       Now there's some other contributory factors that he brings up here. One is success. This is a real obvious one. Success, high morale is, is possible in defeat, but not during a long period of defeat. On such occasions, confidence in leaders will never be Wayne. And the first basis will be undermined to success will aid good morale by creating confidence in the leader and the in the command. This factor requires no enlargement. Uh, next one is regimental tradition. Regimental Spirit can be a powerful factor in making for a good morale. The more a soldier feels himself to be identified with his regiment, the higher will be his morale. If the four essential conditions have been fulfilled, it must be realized. However, that not only that there can be a good morale without strong regimental feelings, but that regiments with a great tradition do not necessarily always produce good battalions.

Speaker 1:          01:51:05       So the the tradition, which there's some units that have awesome traditions and you know, we'll being with some of those, some of those units overseas, I mean the first of the five oh six obviously comes to, comes to light and their, their tradition, the hundred and first airborne tradition was so thick there that pride was in every soldier that, that war, that, that ace of spades at that spade on their gear. I was like, yeah, there's pride there. There's tradition, but he's saying it's not going to replace these other things, but it is a factor that you can use another factor. Again, contributory factor, personal happiness.

Speaker 1:          01:51:55       A man should be happy in the sense that his personal life should be in order. Nothing weakens a man more than trouble at home. It encouraging, it encourages him to think of home and all that. It implies when he should be occupied with the enemy. It turns his mind to peace and his desire to live at the moment when it is necessary for him to steel himself to face the possibility of death. He must never be allowed to forget that it is his job to fight. The function is to kill the enemy and in doing so, he must expose himself to danger. Anything which weakens his will to fight and expose himself must be considered to lower his morale. A soldier is only a family man. After he is a soldier, he must look forward at the enemy and not back towards home. Hmm. Some realism to that. Definitely. I think it can go either way. I think there's times where people can be driven to success by their family back home. Maybe by thinking of their family with just kidding. You can definitely become a distraction depending on the situation.

Speaker 4:          01:53:07       Yeah. It seems like when there's a lot of risk involved, it'll be a district is a distraction

Speaker 2:          01:53:13       maybe.

Speaker 1:          01:53:15       I think it depends on the individual. I think it depends on the circumstances.

Speaker 2:          01:53:19       I think what may be

Speaker 1:          01:53:22       better to look, whether it's a distraction, not as is like what's going on at home. That's what's more important. If there's disruption at home, that's a problem, right? If you've got a guy that's overseas and is, there's problems in the family life, that's, that's wrong, that's going to hurt.

Speaker 4:          01:53:37       Yeah. Yeah. It's weird cause like at w, you know, guys at work sometimes anyway, sometimes, um, you know, they, it's something bad can be going on at home. Then they'll use work to sort of cover it up, like playing in their mind. You know, there'll be like, hey, that like again, sorry for another movie reference, but there's a movie called true lies. Arnold Schwarzenegger. I've seen those. He goes, yeah, so Arnold, I haven't seen it enough times. It came out 20 years ago to be pulling our quote storyline, but hey, let's go with it. It's kind of beside the point of this one. But he goes, uh, you know, Arnold finds out that his wife is, or thinks that his wife cheating on him with it. And then the the partner Tom Arnold, he goes, he's all, let's just focus on work. That's what our, that's what I always do with my life. Turns to dog shit. I just focus on work. Well but, and the, the point is like some people that tell you know something's going wrong at home, they'll be like, you know what? I'm just focusing on work. Screw that. That's forget about it. You know, I'm an immerse myself. A nice team. Can control work. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:54:39       Might not be able to control your relationship that where you think you should be able to. Yeah. So continuing on all soldiers do not have morale effected by home troubles. Some men thrive on on happiness and fight all the more fiercely because they hold a bitter, a secret bitterness within them. Such men are the minority. That's the person that you just talked about, right. Hey, I'm just going to go work harder. But as such, men under the minority, but they are a large minority. They are reminder that happiness cannot by itself produce good morale.

Speaker 2:          01:55:10       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:55:11       Next is administration of man's ordinary. Day to day life must be well organized with us. Hard conditions imposed on him and training to inculcate discipline do not rule out the desirability of good living quarters and in the line a soldiers' morale will be much improved if the administration administrative arrangements are good and if he is assured of proper conditions with a reasonable amount of leisure and comfort when he leaves the Front Leisure Day,

Speaker 2:          01:55:40       where you at? You at the avant

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       and then he says this, but hear a warning must be given. There is a danger today of welfare being considered as an end in itself and not as a means to an end. One of the means of maintaining morale. Welfare by itself will not produce good morale because it is essentially soft and it has already been stated that morale cannot be good unless it contains a quality of hardness. Man, you got to remember that, right? You got to remember that you're not ever going to have good morale unless there's like an element of harkness to it and continuing on hardship and privation are the school of the good soldier.

Speaker 1:          01:56:35       Idleness and luxury are his enemies. Men will endure great hardships if they know why and are convinced of the necessity. Blood, toil, tears and sweat is not for nothing. One of the great rallying calls of the English race Goring's cry guns before butter expressed the same truth. If men believe in the need, hardships are in themselves, stimulant to morale, but the opposite is also true. Let there be any suggestion that butter can come before guns and the men will at once choose butter. If this happens, there will be no morale in this sense of the definition.

Speaker 1:          01:57:18       Then we get propaganda. The uplifting effect of modern propaganda on a soldier is perhaps a new development or Moran's. Morale is raised immensely by the feeling that his efforts are appreciated and applauded not only by his comrades and his officers, but also the world at large. Got It. Get you've got to get that propaganda working for you. I've had a couple of companies I've been working with lately and one of them was being assaulted by its competitors and it had a better product. It's product was doing well, but they were getting assaulted and they were getting assaulted. By the way with lies. Hmm. Like the competitors are just making stuff up, right? To making stuff up, putting that word out there. But now they're rumors on officially, sir. And you know, here's the thing the CEO was kind of did, was quite sure what to do and I said, you have the most towel, the most powerful tool in your arsenal.

Speaker 1:          01:58:24       It's the truth, but you got a weaponized that truth. You got to weaponize it. You've got to turn it into a weapon that you can use to crush the lies. Because if you're doing great things and you're not telling anyone, you're not putting out any propaganda, well then guess what? No one's going to know about it. You just lost your, your valuable weapon, which is the truth. If you're doing good things and your product is better and you can prove that it's better and people know that it's better, but you're not telling anyone you're going, it doesn't matter. You have to weaponize that truth and get it out there. So that's what propaganda is. Now we are moving into the conclusion right here in brief, high morale has been defined as the quality which makes men Indore and show courage in times of fatigue and danger. The cultivation of morale depends upon the training of leaders, the inculcation of discipline, the encouragement of comradeship and the infusing of self respect. The leaders must have a belief in their cause and they must pay attention to numerous contributory factors of considerable but secondary importance. And here's how he closes it out man is still the first weapon of war

Speaker 1:          01:59:38       is training is the most important consideration in the fashioning of a fighting army. All modern science is directed toward his assistance, but on his efforts depend the outcome of the battle.

Speaker 1:          01:59:52       The morale of the soldier is the most important single factor in war. So there he is saying it again, the morale of the soldiers, the most important single factor and war. And as I said, I will argue with that because as far as I'm concerned, without question, leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield. And I'm actually, like I said, I'm thinking I'm right. So no offense to Monte, but I think I'm right because his factors to review them. Leadership, that's the number one factor. Well, that's leadership discipline. Where does that come from? Discipline comes from leadership. Comradeship. Where does that come from? It comes from good leadership, self respect. Where does that come from? It I'm not, I'm not saying that this would Monte Sang. Monte said that discipline comes from leadership. Monte said that comradeship comes from leadership. A Monte said that self respect comes from leadership. So as far as I'm concerned, no offense Monte, as far as I'm concerned, the leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield. But that being said, let there be no doubt that morale without question is a necessity and a requirement for victory. And I will add this. Morale is important,

Speaker 1:          02:01:10       extremely important, not only for 18 not only for a military unit or a business or any kind of organization made up of people, but morale is also important for individuals.

Speaker 1:          02:01:27       For us, day to day, how is your morale? Where's your morale ad? Think about how you approach the day when you're a morale is good. Think about how you go into the day, just like you're going into attack. If you're, if you're going to attack the enemy and your morale is high, you're going to attack with vigor and you're probably going to be successful. If you go in to attack the enemy and your morale is low, you're going to attack without vigor, without enthusiasm, and you're probably going to fail. Well, what about you as a person? If your morale is low, guess what? If you roll into the day, you roll into your mission and your morale is low, likely you are going to fail. So then the question is how do we increase our personal or individual morale and I think it's the same way we improve team morale.

Speaker 2:          02:02:21       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:02:22       We improve our personal morale with discipline, with hardship in with privation and with efficiency and with emotional control and by facing our fears. And of course most important is leadership, leadership, leading yourself and not allowing this leadership vacuum in your head.

Speaker 1:          02:02:51       Right. When I was putting seals through training park in the Dre, if there was chaos broke out, there were some times where no leader would step up and take charge and that would create a leadership vacuum and it was hard to tell what's happening because no one would be saying anything. It would just be silence and you didn't hear anything. And so it's hard to recognize that all of a sudden, wait a second, there's no, no one's leading. You don't recognize it because it's not happening. It's like seeing something that's not there. It's not there so you don't think about it. Well, when no one's leading do take. Sometimes it can be hard to notice that, and I'd call that a leadership vacuum and I teach these young seals like, hey, when that happens, you need to step up. Well, the same thing can happen in your head. You get this leadership vacuum in your head. When you're not leading, you're going to start to slide down the path of least resistance you're going to do in a slip on down that slippery slope. You're going to walk away from discipline. You're got to not impose hardship him and privation on yourself, you're not going to push yourself and your morale is going to go down as well.

Speaker 2:          02:03:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:03:53       And if your morale fails, well

Speaker 2:          02:03:56       yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:03:56       Becomes very easy for you to fail. Don't, don't allow that. Don't allow your morale to fail. Lift up your morale, increase your morale by inflicting yourself with discipline, by doing hard things, by controlling your emotions, by controlling yourself and by leading yourself on the path.

Speaker 2:          02:04:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:04:26       Of discipline, which as we know leads to freedom. And I think that's actually all I forgot

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       for tonight. So Echo Charles. Yes. Speaking of controlling ourselves and leading our selves down the path, I know you've got some, let's say some guideposts on the path, some markers on the path. I do some signals pointing in the right direction. Huge to get us down the path. Yeah. So I was thinking about this today. Hmm. I'm watching my daughter's performance. Little seen performance check this morning. All good. Um, so for whatever reason, good, fine. It was a big group. But what grade kindergarten though? What grade did you give her when she was done? I didn't give a grade. How's she going to know how she's going to improve her performance? I'll give her a, when she gets home check. Okay, good. What you're going to give her foot grid up but probably f for sure because it's a long story that's beside the point by the way. An AF, yeah. What'd she do? You know, just it was, there were some things that happen post-performance what? That two years that, that I didn't approve of the reason for them telling them to do it more, but what happened then? I will go over that later. Um, so the point is I'm thinking like what is the path, this is probably the first time I've ever wanted you to go into detail on the story.

Speaker 4:          02:06:07       Um, did she freak out when she shy? Just give us a global deal? She was, yeah. So she's shy. She's performing good, fine. Like, you know, the whole, it's the whole class. Um, you know, I had a like, what do you call it? An assembly. Okay. Yeah. And so we're talking a hundred kids on stage, or is it just one class and there's only 25 kids on stage and it's not even really a stage. It's like, okay, it's in the classroom in real official scenario. Yeah. So she goes, yeah, they go, they perform good as far as performance goes fine. You know, she remembered the song, she performed it in front of us the night before and the night before that all good. But then they had to sit down and then the assembly sorta went on. So they are sitting down and I look over and I see you're crying.

Speaker 4:          02:06:53       Which I didn't, I was confused, but I know my daughter, like, she's like, she softy like that my fault. I know. So she's looking back on me, looking back to me all salty and I'm, I'm like, I'm not concerned because I know something didn't go wrong. Something's happening that she just doesn't like clay. She's tired of sitting there or something like that. So she's looking back at me. I'm just like, you know, I don't give it that much attention. Later on, I find out as she's walking tour class, cause after assembly they go to their class and she's like, Oh yeah, I didn't like how long the assembly was going on. That's what she said to me and that's why she was crying. That's why she ain't tall. And here's the thing, she shouldn't feel that strongly about it. You know there's something else going on to be honest with you, bro.

Speaker 4:          02:07:45       Shit, she's like a softy. She's like us. I like it when things don't go her way in certain ways and she's uncomfortable or whatever. If I were you hard break it down like this, I wouldn't just give her an f across the board. I would give her like a breakout, maybe some different different categories I'd give her like an a for singing or maybe a B, you know what I mean? Cause he bribed, not hitting every note. Right. Maybe a B minus or whatever. And then give her presence. I to, this is how I used to grade my kids when they would do stuff like this, I'd give them presence, I give him attitude. I'd give them clarity, Annunciation. Like there's a bunch of things you can break it down and, and you don't want to give her five o was across the board obviously.

Speaker 4:          02:08:28       Cause she know five Oh performer not at age six don't exist. No, not a biker downloads. Right. So, so, but then you say, listen, by the way, all your performance, which you have a, you know, you got a 3.8 on, that's your average score. Post-Performance behavior had to give you a zero. Zero. Yeah. Tears, weakness. Don't ever let these other kids know that you've been, you should be avenue attitude. I could stand out here. It can sit out here all day and also simply bring it check. All right, so as this is unfolding, no, this more to the story. Okay, well that wasn't the point that all the setting, I was just thinking like, you know, what is the, what does the path look? What does that, is it just the stuff that Jocko does and now we do it? No, it's not that. Not at all actually credit.

Speaker 4:          02:09:21       Some of the stuff you do, in my opinion is essential. Quintessential. Yeah. It's like ideal. Right. Okay. That's what I think that's might be missing the by a lot. My coming into a solid Tutu most most people. Yeah, but that's just you being hard on the stand on the scale. I don't write on yourself, put it this way. The Path is something specific, but more than that I just, I just realized, not realized, but more like consciously thought of what's not the path. That's what that's important. So it's like, okay, if you're doing Jujitsu, are you not on the path? And not necessarily you have to be doing or neglecting some very specific things to not be on the path. Like if you don't care about what you're eating, like you're just like whatever feels sounds good tonight. That's told the total standard in which you base your meals on, you're probably not on the path.

Speaker 4:          02:10:19       That's a big indicator. One of the factors. And it's an area where you need to tighten things up. Yes. We know you're not performing optimally if you're not eating correctly, you know that. So we'll just say that element is considered not on the path. All right? Sure. So as the, and that's just one example of many, you know, like if you just straight up don't exercise at all. You know, and I'm not, and some people have active lifestyles in general and they don't consider it quote unquote exercise. I get it, but, and then that's different or whatever. But if you're inactive, you're sedentary, that's bad. That quality is not on the path. See what I'm saying? So basically what is not on the path is if you have most of the elements of your life is not on the path. You'll know also, there's also a really broad thing because you could, you don't, even if you're, even if you're trying, right, that's what the path is.

Speaker 4:          02:11:11       The Path is trying, right. The Path is like, Hey, I'm trunk now. I guess. Yeah. I guess that's a little bit strong because I can say I'm trying to work out, but I just did it again. You're not on the voucher. That's a good point. Yes. But you don't have to be, you know, doing the nine hour workout. Yeah. With, with a six hour Jujitsu session afterwards. No. Like, Oh, you only had an hour. You only had 30 minutes to train today. Cool. Got It done quick. I did a pretty quick, where I did 20 minutes today. That's what I got to, I got flew in late last night. Woke up this morning. I had another call. So I was like, okay, cool. I'm going to hammer this thing out. I had that window closing too, you know, you know the window was like, well maybe we'll just pull. Yeah, that's real.

Speaker 4:          02:11:54       You know. No, you can't let the window close. Yup. That was a really good concept. We talked about the Jujitsu window. Yes. It happens with working out too. Right? Even though that's mostly self-imposed, it is mostly selfimposed for working out, but it does happen. And if you have work to do legitimate work, do you have meetings? You have calls and you're like, well, you know, I took that one call or I woke up this morning in all, well, you know, I got that call and it, wait a second, I, you know, brushing my teeth and wait a second, I just gotta check my email. Oh, now the window, it's all knowing when to just shut. Now I'm gonna have to work out later, which will never happen. Don't let the window shut. Yeah, just jump through it and man jumps through the window. But Hey man, and to recognize what the Path isn't is just important as recognizing what the path is.

Speaker 4:          02:12:42       Because if you're like, hey, are you trying to like, I don't know, what do people say? Like are you trying to improve yourself or whatever. Most people will say yes, they'll be like, oh yeah, look at all the things. But it's like you kind of know, you know, like it's different. You just sorta know like if you're doing Jujitsu, you're sort of on the path with that alone. Maybe not fully, but that is a legitimate element. So when you did you get too, if you're new or not new, whatever, you're going to need a geek. You know what gear we getting? I think we all know origin because they are the best keys. So how are they the best keys? Okay, so if you just put one on, you'll sort of know. But here's the main indicator. Won't go too deep into it. But coach Adam [inaudible] the same coach in way of the where where your kid, by the way, there's a real coach Adam.

Speaker 4:          02:13:27       So coach Adam puts on his rift gooey inside out top, get up inside out. I think he thought it was correct and that was indicative of just cause it shows the stitching. You know when you're going get set up shows a stitching. And I looked at it, I was like, Dang, that looks, that looks kind of cool right there. Because Pete was saying he took the genes origin genes, which are now out. Uh, and he was, he turned around, he said, hey, if you want to know what the quality of these genes turned them in, he turned them inside out and he's like, look at what they were working from the inside. So now you have Adam who sees that you put this gear on inside out because the quality is so high that you can't even tell. He thought that was the correct way to do it.

Speaker 4:          02:14:05       And he thought that was what was cracking. Meanwhile, the logo is all backwards and stuff. So you know, he really should have known that, but you know, to each their own and it looked good either way. So that's where we're at with origin. We got clothing including jeans, Jeez t shirts, sweatshirts, uh, other stuff. And then we got supplements as well. Yeah. Supplements are good. Joint Warfare. I think I'm talking to Greg Train, right? One of our main training partners and he has an AC joint situation. Two sides by the way. And I'm till am telling him if you put together the joint or fair with the Super Krill oil discipline every single day, that thing he'll straight up faster, measurably faster, hundred percent. Then just, you know, look at my niece situation, which amen. I'm a believer now you're now a believer. Yeah. I'm, I increased my beliefs of my own personal kind of like wolverine healing powers, which I have joked about performing even though it wasn't really Joe.

Speaker 4:          02:15:06       You know, you know, you joke about something but you kind of mean it. Yeah. I feel real lucky man. Real lucky because my knee was straight up. Yeah. Injured. And it's not healed yet, but Dang, if it hasn't progressed a lot. Yeah. Yeah. And it's not like, you know, when you're like 18 years old, uh, maybe a lighter weight person or something, it's like you tend to sort of heal faster. Let's face it, you're, you know, you're old school and you're not wearing a small school or your old school and you know, what are you walking around at two 30 to 35. I mean that, I'm just saying that's not an easy racket for the knees all the time. Meanwhile you're just boom, boom, boom, bouncing back that fast. That's saying a lot. Joint Warfare, Krill oil. Uh, get some of that. Also the discipline and the discipline go.

Speaker 4:          02:15:57       I had a scenario the other day that's actually yesterday. Sure. Crazy flight situation, thunderstorms, rerouting landing buses, trains is ridiculous. Anyways, I, I'm going into an interview on two hours of sleep all day. Yeah. And this is just after, you know, Peter a t is telling me about all the horrible like cognitive that are going to give you cause and so yeah, I took, I took like, I took like two discipline go. Right when I woke up I was like, all right, hey, I got an interview and like, and then I got there and I did a little bit of, you know, playing around or not playing around, but they're like prepping for the interview. And then I took like three more, so I took five. Discipline goes, rocked it. I read it. I was like a what? You got to a question? Oh, let me tell you a link.

Speaker 4:          02:16:52       So anyways, try that discipline. Go out. If you need something to focus your cognitive skills, skills, skills, for sure you can get some of that. Or you can get the discipline go and you need the discipline powder. Yeah. Should, we've just called that pre jujitsu powder. Yeah. That's it's sorting itself out to be, it kind of sounds like something where you are. We're going to Jujitsu, you know you're going to need cognitive skills and you know you're gonna need some physical skills or some physical enhancements. Sure. So you just jump on a couple of scoops of discipline. Maybe three if you need to, if you want to get nuts. Yeah, that's a good one. That's part of my everyday now I'm pulling the Dave Burke. Yeah, yeah, that's, that's I was, look, there's one thing that's good about it. He doesn't have some crazy amount of caffeine in it.

Speaker 4:          02:17:43       Right? You don't want to be all amped up on caffeine when you take something called the stuff too makes me feel really good. Well, you just took a big hit of caffeine and you're going to get, what's that word? You're going to get a tolerance to it and then it's not going to have the effect that you want. Discipline has like 15 milligrams of caffeine per scoop. That's not that much. So what you feel when you feel like the zoo, you're not really feeling, you're feeling the other ingredients in there. So don't, don't fool yourself into getting all amped up on caffeine, you know, or otherwise. You might as well go do meth or cocaine or just drink some coffee, whichever, you know, that's kind of off the, no, I'm just kidding. Children don't do meth or cocaine. Don't do drugs, period. However, if you want to do something that gives you a sort of a addiction, try some strawberry milk, which is now out for adults.

Speaker 4:          02:18:33       It is absolutely delicious. If you want some extra protein in your body so you can get bigger, stronger, faster, better, yeah, true. And you an or, or if you just want dessert, if you just want some dessert, have some strawberry milk or some peanut butter milk or some mint Malke or some vanilla or dark chocolate. And there you go. Jocko white tea. If you're into tea or even if you're not into t really t you know, against it. But you know, it's one of those things still the Oji original Jocko, White Tea, pomegranate, pomegranate, Chai. No white tea. Jocko decides to make his own light tea with side effects, deadlifting 8,000 pounds, I'll roll with it. It's actually pretty good. So yet get that.
