Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 79 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good Amy. And it has been a little while since we were able to hammer out some Q and a. Sure. Questions from the interwebs. And so here we are number 79 let's answer some questions from the interwebs. What'd he got? Cool. Gill. First question, John. Wait, should we spend a bunch of time with a bunch of fluff and talking about nonsense or should we get to the questions? Let's say we get to the question about 27 minutes worth of advertisements. Let's get to the questions. Rock and roll. I am a vascular surgeon training residents. How do you apply decentralized command when your team changes every one to three month? Yeah, solid question. And with something like that, what we need to do is we need to get a standard operating procedure in place with clear documentation, some kind of a qualification and approval process and then a monitoring system in place.

Speaker 1:          00:01:08       Right. So this, this the reason I can kind of, the reason that's pretty easy transition for me to make mentally is cause we would have to do this kind of thing. Sometimes in the seal teams when you get, for instance, you're overseas on deployment in a war zone and you get some guys that show up to work halfway through the deployment or two months into deployment or three weeks before deployment ends. You get some guys that show up there, seals, right? So they, they, they understand the fundamental concepts but you haven't worked with them specifically before. They haven't worked with the platoon before. They don't know the area of operations that you're in specifically. They don't know what kind of mission specifically you're conducting and where the Intel is coming from. Big Basically, I don't know anything other than the fundamental knowledge of being a seal.

Speaker 1:          00:01:56       But as far as that particular job goes, they don't know too much. So what you have to do is you have to run them through a bunch of familiarization stuff very quickly about the gun trucks and how your Humvees are set up. You've got to make sure they can get on a 50 cal and a mark 48 and a mark 19 and understand our crew served weapons and how we operate them because our crew serve weapons. By the way. A lot of times we most of the time operating our cruiser of weapons alone, so they got to make sure they can do this Humvees right. A lot of the older guys in the seal teams before the war started, they wouldn't know how to operate a home fee, so you had to make sure they knew how to do that. They had to understand the mission, why we're doing the mission, what was important about it, what was the commander's intent?

Speaker 1:          00:02:35       They had to know the rules of engagement because the military, we'll take a guy that lands in country, they'll give them like a 30 minute brief to welcome to in country in 30 seconds of it will be a rules of engagement brief and they won't really understand it. So you've got to make sure they understand that you've got an when's the last time they did med training? Medical training. When's the last time you did that? Has it been like 12 years since they put on a tourniquet? Okay, not good. We got to get them familiarized on that. How they going to stop the bleeding, the different IED threats that are out there. Cause the ID threats change all the time. What kind of trigger mechanisms are being used and what kind of identifying marks or for IED. So there's all this stuff. The list goes on and on and so you have to develop some kind of a standard operating procedure.

Speaker 1:          00:03:13       Hey, when a guy shows up, this is what we need to do with them. Boom, they need to go through this, this, this, this, this, this little checklist you put together. And then if the person's a leader, maybe you got to go and do a couple left seat, right seat rides with them. So does that mean, do other people use that terminology? Left seat, right seat. Not that I know. Okay. So if I was the platoon commander and you are coming in to take over for me, we would plan a mission together and I would be in charge of the mission. Yeah. So I'd be in the driver's seat or like a pilot copilot. Yeah. And you'd be in the next seat. You'd be, you'd be watching and you'd be in the passenger seat and I would be running everything. And then maybe we do that a couple times and you're just watching me.

Speaker 1:          00:03:54       And then we switched seats. You get the driver's seats. But I'm still there watching it and telling you to move a little left to move a little right. And then eventually you got it. And then I'm going to leave, go home. So maybe if the person's a leader, you've got to do two or three or four ops or whatever, to get them a good turnover. So that now when all of these situations, or if you're, if it's not a full on turnover cause that you're going to walk away from, but if it's just a, uh, you've got some other groups, small entity or people that are coming in, you're not going to be able to give them that full hundred percent decentralized command, right? You're still gonna have to keep a little bit more watch on them because you're not going to build up the full level of trust in one to three months.

Speaker 1:          00:04:34       That just not possible. So there will be a little bit of limitations, but you can definitely, you can definitely move pretty far down the path. And one other thing that's going to help, I said document and that's really smart to put together a document with very clear roles and responsibilities and expectations and then not just give them the document and say, Hey, read this letter. No, no. You sit down and go over every single thing with them. So what you're trying to do is you're trying to condense this timeline of building trust into the shortest possible time. And one of the ways you do that is by condensing everything into a simple, clear, concise format, written format, go through, talk it with them so they understand it and getting to do it very clearly. Like when I was in tasking at bruiser, I didn't lay anything like that out for the platoon commanders for life in the Delta platoon commander.

Speaker 1:          00:05:26       I didn't say, here's the rules and there's, I did that over a long for your time, you know, over a year workup now that now we did a few months, they kind of knew what the deal was. But if I would have, if that would've been my normal job and I would have been getting a new platoon commanders every three months, every time they came in and be like, are you a new between grantors? We just hold up to the commander does, this is the rules, rules, roles and responsibilities. This is the, uh, expectations that I have for you. This is when you call me, this is when you make a decision on your own. Lay all that stuff perfectly clear. And that way I could more quickly develop a sense of decentralized command. Now again, it's not going to be full decentralized command. You're not going to have to just let somebody run with it.

Speaker 1:          00:06:04       They've only been together for three months. And you know, I don't know. I don't know what the timeline is too, for a vascular surgeon to get total trust in their subordinate vascular surgeons or their subordinate team members. But I'm sure it takes longer than one to three months. So how much can you condense the timeline? What can you do to condense it? Once you get a condensed, as much as you can, you're still going to have to do a little bit more monitoring than you would normally do, but it is still going to be beneficial. It's going to be beneficial for them and it will be beneficial for you to operate as much as you can in the decentralized, uh, methodology. So when you say condensed, the timeline, that's for the procedure? No, it's condensed. The timeline to build trust. Oh, actually, so I want to, decentralized command is about trust, right?

Speaker 1:          00:06:51       If I trust you and you trust me, it goes up and down. If I'm in charge and I trust you, that means you're going to go out and you know what to do and when you're out there you know you trust that I am going to cover for you and I'm going to trust the decisions that you make. So decentralized command is about trust and who would have trust. We have to have understanding and in order to understand things we have to work together. So what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to condense the timeline that it takes us to build trust and how do I do that? I just am very direct and lay things out in a very simple, clear, concise format so that you can understand it very quickly. That's my goal. It makes sense.

Speaker 1:          00:07:28       Next question. When and how is the right way to skip the chain of command when you feel like your direct superior is a part of the problem? Big One, big one. Because this is very, very problematic and skipping the chain of command is a last resort. It is a last resort. Why is it a last resort? Because when you, when you skip the chain of command, you're breaking the trust I just talked about. You're breaking it. The relationship that you've been building, your damaging it, it's not good. Sometimes it's an salvageable. By the way. Sometimes when you skip the chain of command, you will never be able to recover from that. Now, of course, if there's something that the your immediate superior is doing that's illegal or immoral or unethical, if that's the case, then it's actually your duty to go above them and the chain of command.

Speaker 1:          00:08:26       Now, do you still first report it to them and say, Hey, what you did is wrong. We're not going to do that. Yes, you should tell them first unless it's going to cause you to get in some horrible situation. Now, this is an interesting thing that I've thought about. Let's say you and I are working together. Sure. And, and you're my boss and you, let's say you're doing something that's immoral, illegal, unethical, right? And I watch you do it and, and I, and I see you leaning towards it. I'm like, oh, I think he's going to do something that's illegal right here and I don't say anything. And then I watch you do it and then I run up the chain of command report you in Boston. You right.

Speaker 1:          00:09:08       You gotta be careful with that. And, and I think when you work for someone or when someone works for you, you need to lay it right out of the gate. Like, Hey, this is where I stand. Like I'm not going to cover for you. If you do some stupid illegal things. You don't wait for them to do it and then drop the hammer on them. Maybe I'm being overly fair. Maybe we should to be all out to get people that are, you know, doing something that they shouldn't be doing part of the problem. Yeah. I actually, I believe that's my belief is when I, when I meet you and I say, Hey, well, what's going on? And you make a little crack. You know, you make a little joke, you know, you say, well, you know, it's not like, it's not like the, it's not like the, uh, customers can really see that money.

Speaker 1:          00:09:59       You know, let's say you're going to skim money, right? You got, yeah. You make a little joke like that, you know, you and you're in, what you're doing is testing the waters with me testing my ethical or moral. So I'd be like, yeah, there's no way they would ever know. And besides, we pretty much work for it anyways. Right, right. You're going to see if we're going to get that reaction with it. So, you know, we just, you know, sometimes we have good, got a little charge, a little extra on that install. Right. Maybe we're, maybe we're some kind of installers that house and usually, yeah. You know, I usually throw a little upcharge on here and they never know if that's type of wall, whatever. Yeah. You throw that test at me, it's my duty. If I'm the type of person that's going to report you for skimming money from the customers, then I should tell you like, hey man, that's not cool now.

Speaker 1:          00:10:43       Yeah. Now those customers that you know, here's my view is those customers that were out there trying to do this install four, they had to work hard for that money and I don't want to be taken it from him. Now you kind of know you better not be doing that in front of me as opposed to me smiling and going along with your joke. And then three months later I report, you know, a turnover report to the boss man. Yeah. So I don't think that's very ethical. Evil. Yeah. It's kind of like a mislead you. It's a little bit of a backstabber. Now are there cases of course where somebody is doing something that's just outrageously unethical and you didn't know about it or something. You pretty much know though you can tell when people are doing shady things. So, so I think that that is something, okay, so let me, let me put it, let me, let me close this thought or at least make a point of this thought.

Speaker 1:          00:11:33       My point of this thought is it's the same thing that happens a lot where people don't like to have hard conversations. So it's an easy conversation when you say, you know what? Those customers never know where their money goes and it's only 12 bucks and thing and it's no big deal. The easiest thing for me to do is to smile and say, Eh, yeah, right. That's an easy, and, and, and that's not that big of a deal, right? It gets so much harder. The further we go down that road, it gets harder and harder and harder because then you start saying, hey, you know, it's only, you know, we, we've been scamming like 12 bucks. Guess what? They never noticed this other charge either. And I can get him for $62 and then all of a sudden it's a harder conversation. So have the hard conversation earlier, it'll make it easier for you. So

Speaker 1:          00:12:24       that being said, now how do we escalate above you in the chain of command? First of all, my goal is to not escalate above you and the chain of command. My goal is to actually raise the situation to you and bring it up to you and say, Hey, echo, you know the way we've been doing this job. You know, I think we should do it a different way. I think there's a better way to do it. I think there's a better way to treat the customer, whatever, whatever the thing is, better way to attack this target or whatever the thing is. And I'm going to have that conversation with you like two, three, four or five times to try and get you to listen to me. Now, if the conversation doesn't work, I'm going to escalate it even further. You know what I'm gonna do?

Speaker 1:          00:12:59       I'm gonna actually do a little write up. I'm gonna read a point paper. I'm going to say Echo. I was listening and thinking about what we're doing, how we're hitting this target or how we're loading out our guys or whatever, and I'm going to write you a point paper and I'm gonna, I'm gonna lay it out for him to lay out what my plan is, what the cost benefits are, and make that very clear to you. So that way I'm giving you every ample opportunity to listen to what I'm saying. Right. And I'm probably even going to say, hey, maybe we should run this by, you know, the boss to see what they think. Because if you just keep disagreeing with me and I said, you know, can, can I, do you mind if I bring it to the boss and see what he thinks now what are you going to say to that most? Most the immediates are not going to be happy, but I'm giving you a heads up because I'm just trying to play open. And it kind of doesn't, it kind of make them reflect too, where it's like, Hey, I'm going to, you know, bring somebody there with, oh, what did he say? No, don't bring that to the boss. It's kind of like, ah, it makes it real overt that they're not doing correct. Yeah. So,

Speaker 1:          00:14:00       so yeah, you say, and you might get a boss, you might get a boss goes, yeah, bring it to him. He's going to say the same thing I'm telling you. And then you go home. Maybe I'm wrong, I'm wrong about this procedure. Or maybe I'm wrong about how we're going to attack this target. But it is, and also this is a hard conversation to have. It's a hard conversation to say someone, man, can we just bring this to the boss, sir? And, and, and again, I'm not saying you say, Hey, I'm going to bring this to the boss and say, Hey, would you mind if I got his opinion? Would you mind if I see what she said about this? And that way we're, we're not saying I'm going to the boss. Go ahead and go over your head. You can't stop me. No, that's not what I'm talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:14:40       So there's that. The other thing that you could, so that's, that's sort of a direct approach with your immediate boss, which starts by the way, with an indirect approach of being like, Hey Nico, you, I was thinking about the way we're hitting these targets. Wouldn't it be smart? Maybe if we hit him from over here, do you think that would work? And now we're just opening up the conversation. So we've done that. I can also go indirect with your boss. Right. So, so your direct boss who's now to up above me and the chain grant, I can go in direct with him at the Water Fountain, right? Yeah. Hey. Oh yeah, thanks Paul. See everything's going great. Yeah. Doing a great job. Yeah. Worker. Yeah, I'm on echoes team. Yeah, yeah. No, it's really good. It's good. It's a tough mission. But you know, we're, we're always exploring new ways to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:15:19       You know, we're looking at some other ops. I was thinking of the, another way to hit those targets to kind of like coming in from this direction. Oh, that's all I did was just drop the little plant a little seed, you know, have that conversation come up and I'm just going to, that's what I'm gonna do. Plant the little seeds and try and get them to maybe say, oh, that sounds like a really good idea. What Adecco think of that. I, I, you know, actually I haven't talked to echo about it in full detail, but uh, I will not about, hey man, the boss asked me about this and he was mentioning, you know, I mentioned this other way of doing it and he thought it might be good idea and I just want to give you a heads up in case he says anything. Uh, I didn't really have a chance, you know, whatever. So we're just playing the game a little bit. That's that line. I just wanted to give you the heads up. I feel like that's like real good when someone says that it is, however, it also gets a, it's also a way of saying, Hey, I ratted you out.

Speaker 1:          00:16:15       I ratted you out. Depending on what it's followed with. It's like, Hey, I just want to give you a heads up. The boss, you know, asked me about this and I didn't know how to respond so I said this and he had to come and talk to you. It's, I just wanted to give you a heads up that's different than I, just to give you a heads up. I talked to the boss earlier today. I told him what your deal is, something like that, that's not good for you. So yeah, there's all kinds of shades of gray there as well. And, and you know, I worked for for a while I was the admiral's aid and so I, and I worked for a really great guy, great admiral, who I had a really good relationship with, you know, and if I needed something he was going to give it to me. And so when I was a task unit commander, which is what, which is what job I went to immediately when I got done working for the admiral, I literally had a direct line to the admiral because I had his cell phone number. I had his office number and if I wanted to call him, he wanted to talk to me because we were friends.

Speaker 1:          00:17:17       But that doesn't mean that I went to him and said, you know, did all kinds of, you know, I didn't do that. No, I never took advantage of that ad at all and was always professional. But there is this little story where as odd as this might sound, we were getting ready to go into the limit and we needed a, uh, what's called a large format color printer and it prints out big pieces of paper, large format. And you need it because you need to make battle maps. Yeah. And you need a good one because when you are on an operation, every single guy in the platoon has a map. So you could have, you might need eight, 10, 12, 15, 30. You might need 30 color laminated maps to go out on a mission. And for whatever reason, I think we had one, it was kind of crappy.

Speaker 1:          00:18:08       And the boss, the admiral, you know, I talked to him before I was going on deployment. I don't know if he called me or I ran into him or whatever. And he's the admiral in charge of everything and he's just, you know, getting a feel for what's going on. And he says, um, you know, hey you everything you need for diplomate. Cause he knew I was leaving in a couple of days or a couple of weeks, couple of weeks and I said, yeah, you know sir, we're, we're, we're good to go. You know, right now, believe it or not, I'm just waiting on a printer. You've got to get one of those large format printers for battle maps. But other than that we're, we're rocking and rolling. And like that afternoon I got back to my office and the commodore, so now it's two bosses above my immediate boss at the seal team and one guy below the admiral, we don't have like a message for me.

Speaker 1:          00:18:53       He was like, hey. And Luckily I was friends with him. I guess you need a printer, let me know what kind it is. Like thanks for the heads up. And I was like, Hey, sorry sir, I just saw him in the quickie mart or whatever. But uh, but yeah, you know, you, you gotta you gotta you don't want to abuse that stuff at all and you got to got to be smart about it and it's always is, I'm telling you, it's always, it's, it's not good to skip the chain of command. It really isn't. It's not going to generally is not going to benefit you at generally going to put you in a bad situation. It's going to give you less leverage with your immediate boss. Cause if I went above the chain command on you, even with you get redirected by our boss, you are pissed and you're gonna, you're gonna sabotage.

Speaker 1:          00:19:41       Yeah. It's like a, it's really, it's a version of going behind someone's back. Oh for sure. It is. And it almost even feels like even if you tell them, it feels like, oh you're going a my head going behind my best. It's a really, it's a really, it's a tough one. You got, you got to use caution with that one. And also, I'll tell you what else it is. It's, it's an easy, it's, it appears to be the easy way out. Like if you're not listening to me, I'll call them. She could go both the chain of command instead of me influencing you, explaining to you writing point papers to you, building a relationship with you so that you trust me. Instead of doing all those things that take time and effort and tact, I'm going to skip the chain of command until your boss.

Speaker 1:          00:20:23       So that's, that's another negative about it. It's a cop out. You shouldn't need to do it. I can't like that printer story I just told it like, Eh, other than that, me going above the chain of command and that was almost a comical thing. Like I said, I was friends with the common or two who always took great care of me and was laughing when he left a message like, oh, thanks for the heads up. You know, he wasn't mad when he said that he was, you know, he was laughing because here I was getting ready to deploy to Iraq and what I want is a printer. That's what we need, which can tell you how dialed in we were and how much great gear we, yeah. Because the only thing that was left that we need to as a printer, you know, that's where I was at when I get old.

Speaker 1:          00:21:00       Everything we needed, but I needed a printer. So you went above his head and I get it for the printer. But you got to, you know, other than that, it's really hard for me to think of other times in my naval career where I went above someone in the chain of command. It just didn't happen. You know, I'm going to take the time to build a relationship with my immediate boss and they're going to do what I want them to do. They're going to get me what I want him to give me. They're going to support me the way I needed to get supported. That's what I'm going to do. That's leading up the chain of command, skipping the chain of command isn't really leadership. Yeah. So try not to do it. Kind of like when you're a kid and you're, you got to deal with your older brother or something, but instead of dealing with them, you going to tattle on him.

Speaker 1:          00:21:37       Something like that feel. Yeah. No, it's the same. Same, a similar thing. Not that my little brother tattled on me ever in the flight. Yeah. Interesting. How you, and it seems like this is a common theme to how you were, uh, like you want to try the most and the best you can to deal with it yourself like the most for sure. From the beginning. I'll own it. I mean, just like how you were saying how like if you've got to fire someone, you know where you want to get to the point where deal with it in the beginning. Yeah. Like you can't, like just let them do the wrong thing. He'd be like, yeah, that's cool. Let them do it for years and then be like, you know what? You're fired because of all these wrong things and you didn't even bring it up.

Speaker 1:          00:22:14       And I think about this too, like on the unethical things you, you might be, again, I'm going to, I'm going to walk a fine line here, but you might not recognize, you might not recognize that what you're doing is unethical. He might be like, Hey Jocko, you know, what I do is I just, I always hit everyone with this little extra $12 charge, you know, no big deal. No one ever notices it. And uh, you know, we're working hard and you might just, hey man, it gives you food for your kids and you're working on a bunch of rich people's houses so they can afford 12 bucks and it's not that big of a deal to you. And maybe somebody that you started working for did the same thing. And that's kind of just the standard operating procedure. Whereas if I was like, man, you know what, that's not good.

Speaker 1:          00:22:54       You know, that's actually, it might not seem like a big deal, but you're taking money. You're, you know, you know that puts money on your table, gives you, feed your kids and taking money off their table. You know, and whether they're rich or not, money's money as I don't think, I don't feel like we should be doing, you know what I mean? I can might awaken you and get your ethics back on track and you might be a good dude cause just cause someone was skimming some money doesn't mean they're a horrible person, right? It means that they went down the wrong path. It just because someone goes down the wrong path doesn't mean they can come back big doesn't mean they cannot come back to the right path. Man, if I was, if I was, you know, executed every time I did something that was stupid or, or bad or you know, I shouldn't have done, I would've died a thousand deaths by now.

Speaker 1:          00:23:37       Right? We grow up and we learned these things. We become better people but we only become better people and we only learn these things. If somebody teaches them to us now we can learn the hard way, which is, you know, all of a sudden someone looks at you and goes, oh wait, what's this charge for 12 bucks? And then they follow up all your receipts for the last five years you've been working here. And then they realize you've stolen money from the company and stole money from these customers and they're going to prosecute you because stealing over x amount of dollars is a felony. You know what I mean? So then you learn your lesson, but that's not the lesson we want to learn. So having those tough conversations like you're talking about having them upfront and whether it's urine we write, whether it's counseling somebody, whether it's dealing with, you know, my boss who I want to tell like, hey, I think there's a better way to do this.

Speaker 1:          00:24:21       Any of those. The earlier you do them, the easier they are to have. And the longer you wait to do them, the harder they get. Yeah. So also too, it's just an overall help. Like, I dunno, it's hard to not draw the analogy, not analogy, but the comparison between um, like your boss in subordinate's type situation and parenting kids, you know, like for sure. Just like, are you saying sometimes people don't know necessarily that it's unethical or they don't know it's that unethical or something like that? That's, that's it. I mean, in my situation with kids, like they don't know, essentially they don't know better. You know, like, I dunno, you take a permanent pen and you draw all over the walls here, four or five years old and you're like, yeah, sure. I've been drawing on paper this whole time, so there's no reason for me to think, sure I should draw on the walls, but there's really nothing to tell me not to do.

Speaker 1:          00:25:12       So they do it and then they go get beat or something like that or just yelled at or something. Some, some punishment, straight up punishment instead of, you know, okay, you didn't know that. You have to know this. You know, it's like that kind of stuff. How are you going to tell the story? We were, I was going through officer candidate school and there's a manual and you're going through officer candidate school. I can't remember what it is, but it's all the rules of officer candidate school, everything you, this is how uniform supposed to be. This is the way your locker supposed to be. These are the way you stay in line at the Chow Hall. All the, every single rule is in this book, and I forget what it's called. So you live by the code of this book and it's very specific rules. And there was a kid who was going through officer candidate school with us and he was from another country.

Speaker 1:          00:25:57       He had been raised in other country and became an American citizen, but he was from another country and grew up in a really poor, you know, a really poor kid. So good for him. I mean he had achieved incredible amount finishing college, going to officer candidate school. It was awesome. But he had some habits from growing up in the third world that were a little bit different for, you know, for Americans. And one of the things that he would do is he would urinate in the shower and, and not just while he was taking a shower, but when you come back from a class or something, you know, you'd, everyone has to go to the bathroom at the same time. And so, you know, guys would go in and they fill up the urinals and then there's nowhere to piss. So what are you going to do?

Speaker 1:          00:26:38       Well, he would just go in the shower and it's a big open shower. You just go in there a piss right and the drain. Like it was nothing. Toilet, shower, toilet, shower, whatever day. And one of the American kids, and I'm calling the kids, these guys were all, you know, actually we had, some of them were new kids fresh out of college. The kid, the kid that was urinating in the shower was fresh out of college and one of the older guys who was like me, it was a prior enlisted guy, he came to me and he said, hey man, this kids urinating in the shower like all the time. And I said, I said, okay, well we know run the water. And he's like, Brandon, I got to get the exact exact, you know, my squad's in charge of cleaning in the showers. And so these are my guys on there on the ground, the cleaning up his piss, it ain't cool.

Speaker 1:          00:27:18       And I was like, all right, cool, I'll talk to him. So I went and I said, hey man, I said, hey, you know, officer candidate, whatever, can I, can I talk to you for a second? He goes, yeah. And he comes in my room and I said, hey man, you, you, um, you know, you're, you're, you're pissing in the shower. Just wait for a toilet. And he looked at me like I was telling him that he shouldn't breathe air, right? He was like, well, why? And I said, I said, well, no, because you know, you're, you're, you're pissing where everyone walks around and he goes, you have to do a water to drain pipes in. He goes, and I said, no, it's not, just, just don't do it. He goes, it's not in the rule book. This is what he said to me. And I go, what do you mean?

Speaker 1:          00:27:54       He goes, and he named the manual. He goes, it doesn't say in there that you can't piss in the shower. I was like, well, it doesn't say you get piss on my floor either order my bed, but I don't want you to doing that. But it was interesting. My point is that his viewpoint was like this was totally normal and he, and he was a great kid and I just a hard worker. But for him he was just like, what are you talking about? Why wouldn't I pissed in the shower? All the, all the pictures are taken. I'm going to go piss in the shower. Well next question, let's move on. I got work to do. And so I had to explain to him, hey man, listen, it's, it's a little different. And people that are cleaning the showers don't want to be down on their hands and knees in your pis.

Speaker 1:          00:28:30       So, and he said, okay. And he, he listened to me and, but I could see that he listened to me, but he didn't a hundred percent agree with me. He was like, okay, that's fine. Yeah, you kinda did that. You know, and it was one of those where I tried to explain to them the why, but it just needs, it's like you're saying like he literally didn't understand that that was not acceptable from a hygienic point, hygienic, hygienic, hygienic, from a hygienic point, from a, you know, a moral or our morale point of the morale down there, cleaning up. So yeah, that was a, that was good times. You never seen that Seinfeld, you watch Seinfeld ever. I know what that is, right. I know it's too negative. That's what they talk. He gets caught. One of the guys gets caught taking a leak in the shower at the gym, you know, and take a shower and then it's like, you know, they catch you in the, you're ostracized basically. I think they even took his mat, I dunno. But he was like, yeah, you believe this there, whatever. You know, they're, they're mad at me for, you know, pissing in the shower at the gym. And he's like, he's like, what, why are you confused at, they're mad at you kind of thing. And he's like, it's all pipes.

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       We don't Google it. You know, he's trying to defend it and you can kind of see where in a small, teeny, tiny way, if you don't think about it. Yeah. Like why not? It's going down the drain. You're not pissing on the, on the people. Hey, I was deployed on a ship and I was an officer as an ensign, so I had just moved up from the, from the troop virgin where I used to be with the enlisted spine. So we used to proudly call ourselves and all of a sudden I was up in the, in the officer area, in the A, what they call those areas, officer country. She's, they have little signs, officer country and he, Oh, no enlisted allowed lead us, totally lead us. So I'm in there and I'm living with, uh, uh, we actually had four other seals, the seal officers in this room, in one of the seal officers, there was a sink in the room but no bathroom.

Speaker 2:          00:30:25       So you just had a sink, you brush her teeth, shave, whatever. But if you want to go the bathroom, you to go down the hallway where the showers and the pictures were. And so one night I'm, you know, I'm like get stirred awake by some noise and I see one of my fellow officers is pissing in the sink right in sync and you know, I, I was like, hey man, what are you doing? He's like, I'm not walking all the way to then down to the down to the bathroom. And I was like, yeah, actually, yes you are. That's where I brushed my teeth homes and he, and he was the same way. He was kind of surprised like what's wrong with you? It's just pissed and it's the same pipes, but right now do me a favor, just walk on down there. What if he urinated in the sink regularly, but every single time when he was done, he scrubbed the sync with like lights and stuff, bro.

Speaker 2:          00:31:17       It's all psychological. I thought, well it's not just psychological, but that doesn't even make it worth it now. You might as well walk down there. I dig it. But like what if that was just his thing? I mean, well how would you feel about it? Don't piss in my sink. Yeah, right. It's like a, it's like a, it's like a, um, what do you call like a customary almost for reasons. Of course. The reason is don't piss it. Actually in college we played football and we did it like a nice facility too at Uah. But the showers were like, guys would do it all the time and, but the showers were shaped different where like let's say you're facing the shower, right? Or you're facing the wall at the bottom of the wall was like a gutter trench. Yeah. So it went down. So if you did and one guy's would, it would go to Aa.

Speaker 2:          00:32:00       You weren't ever standing in it, you know? So if you're standing in it, that's like obvious, you know, but, but guys would do it. And when I first saw it I was like, Dang, he just openly doing it. Like one of this, I actually mentioned this, maybe it's where I'm not gonna mention cause it fits in the shower, but he's like talking to me while he's pissing in the shower. Almost like it was a straight up toilet. It was like I said and he's like, yeah, I'll talk to me. And I'm like, alright. That's how, so again, it's more like the ethics of the, like the, the culture almost is what it seemed like. Yeah. What it seems like to me is don't piss in my sink. I agree. Oh yeah. The sink is different. Different ballgame. Yeah. Shower. Okay. Understood. Right. Like you said, it goes down the drain and it's, there's water flowing all over it.

Speaker 2:          00:32:46       Yeah. You're washing it off anyway off the slope coming over it. But uh, you know what, I got a good idea. Just as a general overall rule, pissing the I, we better do that one. Yeah. The same way and probably not going to brush your teeth in the toilet. That's what the thing is now. If you want to pay, if you want to brush your teeth in the toilet, have at it. I won't be mad at you. I'll be mad at you. I don't know if I can hang out with you as much or whatever, but yeah, I understand. It makes sense. Talking, talking toilets from talking about skipping the chain of command. Oh yeah, that's right. Cause the guide ocs officer candidate school. Yeah. You got us into the shower. He had to let them know up. You've got to have the hard conversations. I wonder whatever happened to him. He was a hard work where we see from somewhere like Vietnam or Laos or something.

Speaker 3:          00:33:36       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:33:38       Maybe Thailand, some Asian, Asian countries. Southeast Asian country. Yeah. Hard worker and smart. Yeah. I would think, yeah. My opinion about taking a leak in the shower is you shouldn't do it. But if like, like this guy who's like, oh that's normal. That doesn't totally surprise me though. Yeah. No, it doesn't surprise me, but it makes sense that guys didn't like it though. For sure. Next question. And, and, and don't skip the chain of command if you can avoid it by yeah, don't do that either. Yeah. Anything going behind someone's back. It just, it just like how you say it, it's like sometimes you can't repair that. It's harder to repair,

Speaker 3:          00:34:19       harder to repair. Hello.

Speaker 2:          00:34:24       How do you rank your longevity in your priorities? Longevity. This is talking about staying alive for as long as possible. And of course, I mean I want to live, oh like how do I, how do I personally, that's the way it was court. The question is actually directed at me. Jocko Willink. Question for the podcast. How do you rank your longevity and your priorities? Longevity being how long are you going to live for? And for me, I mean obviously the longevity has some level of importance. I do want to live for a little while longer, but, and, and I think that generally my lifestyle and my focus on health and fitness in a broad way align with living for a little longer. So, you know, working out and all that stuff is good. But there's also an extreme, and I don't know if you know this, I don't know how much you know about this or if you've ever read about it, but there's an extreme side of longevity of trying, if you, if your goal in life was to live as long as possible, there's an extreme version of that. Do you know about this? I Dunno how so? Well, one of the biggest things is you, you do

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       a calorie restriction from massive calorie restriction. You're talking like massive calorie restriction and that's one of them. You and, and believe it or not, you do extremely low levels of physical activity. Yeah. Right? You, you basically, if your goal was to live as long as possible, you would want to live basically in a bubble and do nothing but eat very little and just lay there. Hmm. Um, no Jujitsu, didn't know surfing, no lifting, heavy weights, none of that stuff. Now when you're in that mode of longevity, pure longevity, you are not prepared for anything in the actual world, right? Because your, your heart can only beat so many times and if the less you use it, the longer it's going to be lasting. But, and I'm sure I have that not quite right, but the problem is if you're not in good shape, when you get surprised, your heart can't handle it.

Speaker 1:          00:36:42       That's the kind of people that have heart attacks because the heart can't handle all this madness when it comes. So I'm not going there. It's not worth it for me too. For me to live my whole life as a sedentary person, half starved and completely unprepared for anything to happen to me outside of my bubble is not happening. I'm not going to live that way. Um, so where does it rank in my priorities? I think it's it. Sure it's an important thing, but I think my general lifestyle aligns with enough that I don't think about it as much. And I think overall living life is more important to me than just living. Yeah. So it makes got to live life.

Speaker 4:          00:37:23       What if magic, like a magic wizard guy says, I'm the gatekeeper of your whole life, whatever your life and death situation, he's a grim reaper. That's what it was. And he said, I know when you're gonna die, you know you can't help it. This, I just know the future, whatever. I will give you 20 extra years. Right now you're, you know, 40 something years old, the day you're going to die, whatever that is. I can't tell you that. Maybe 90 maybe 80 whatever, but I'll give you 20 more years of fully functional life. But you got to stop doing Jujitsu right now. You can never do that ever again.

Speaker 1:          00:38:05       I'd probably choke him out. Next question.

Speaker 4:          00:38:09       Otherwise you'd be just as functional. You can laugh, you can surf, you can, you know, you can get after it in, in every other way. Just know Jujitsu. No martial arts in any way.

Speaker 1:          00:38:18       You know what? I would double leg him and then I would pass his guard and then I would choke him. Yeah, yeah, makes sense. And I'd take his sickle. Yeah. And I free the world.

Speaker 4:          00:38:33       Well, a Jiu Jitsu life is

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       not life. That's what you're saying. I think the minute you start restraining yourself from doing things that you want to do, you would need to take serious considerations in what you're doing. Yeah. Yeah. I also think that hypothetical questions like that are completely ridiculous. No, they're not. They're mental exercise. So my, that's why then in that case I will stay with my first answer. Yeah, I agree. If the grim reaper came to me and made me an offer, I would double leg him. I would take him down and I would joke, I'm out. There you go. I might kill him. Yeah, I might kill Beth. Yeah, there you go. See Boom. And you can't do that without you just do so as far as the double leg and choking someone up. So back to your, um, how do you say how the longevity thing, it didn't know about that actually.

Speaker 2:          00:39:23       Yeah. And it, and it makes sense cause that's a lot of things like if you want to be the safest you possibly can in life, right. The same thing. You can just get to live in a bubble with no threats of any disease, sterilized bubble, no murders, no car accidents, no nothing, never drive, never do anything. The same thing. Well, you'll be so safe, you'll be the safest person in the world. Really. Yeah. But as far as quote unquote living life, you know, you go one day out in the, in the wild, all you're dead. Same thing. Like if you restrict all your calories, no hard physical activity, no son, you know, all this stuff. The moment you go to everyday life, which is physical in some is less waste than before, but still physical. There's Sun, there's days when you go out there all year.

Speaker 2:          00:40:07       That's right son. All or nothing. Yeah. Take Vitamin D pills. The uh, the other thing is with calorie restriction is I think, and you know, I'm reading about this stuff all the time and, but you can get a lot of those benefits by doing some intermittent fast for sure. Yeah. And you will feel good on the intermittent fasting. Yeah. 24, 48, 72 hours. That's the most I've done is you know, and maybe I'll do some more in the future. Tim Ferriss did like seven days. Okay. I want you to actually, you know, I dunno man. Yeah, yeah. But in c and that's it. That almost goes into a whole, honestly, when I did 72 hours the last time I did it the same thing. I've done it a couple of times now. Every time I feel fine. Yeah. I don't feel any of this stuff that people talk about.

Speaker 2:          00:40:53       Yeah. Well yeah. So I mean it's, this is almost even, I feel hungry for a little while, but I do, I wasn't like, Oh God. Right. Who wasn't going to die? No, you were. No, but you're talking about a whole different thing. If people are going to say, people are gonna ask on the interwebs to talk more about intermittent fasting. No, don't ask me. There's like actual research out there. Go and Google it. Look up and harassed fasting and read about it. Don't ask me, I'm the wrong person to ask. You. Ask Smart People. Yeah. And again, that intermittent fast, like if you're talking about like did like 10,000 questions

Speaker 1:          00:41:33       on Twitter because it's true, don't ask me Google it and look at these really good research paper. There's all kinds of stuff coming out about it right now. Now what's weird about the Internet and science in general is in, you know, there's a one article that says it's great, you can find two more articles that say it's horrible. You can find three more articles. So you can always count on

Speaker 4:          00:41:55       everything. Yeah. I mean, although the have to split hairs, but that's not necessarily about science in general. It's more about a specific person's viewpoint based on what they've k yeah, for sure. For sure. Um, and especially with diet and health, it's so, it's so ambiguous and so adaptable and stuff like that. So, but if you're talking about fasting, that's, that's, you're talking about something different. Like people fast for a specific reason or even that kind of a general reason, but it's like fascinating alone isn't going to make you achieve whatever it is you're doing. You know, it's a complete, just like lifting, like with lifting, you need nutrition, you need rest, you need all this stuff for a specific results and then there's all kinds of different lifting, you know? So you can't just be like, oh yeah, I want bigger muscles so I'm just gonna lift.

Speaker 4:          00:42:43       That's it. No nutrition, I'm not going to eat at all or no rest, I'm not going to rest at all. So the point there is when you go try and live as long as you possibly can, it's like you have to like that has to be the objective just to live everything else is, everything else is out the window. So you, yeah, I don't, I agree with you. I don't think that that's living necessarily. I don't think there's too many people that are just on the full on lung longevity Gig. But there are some, yeah, I know, I know one, I'm not going to mention his name. Check I guess would be your little secret. Next question. Similar question. Yeah. Jocko, prioritize and execute. Is it wrong to sacrifice health in short term to accomplish work objectives and how would you make up

Speaker 1:          00:43:37       the time lost? So yeah, absolutely. Sometimes you have to sacrifice workouts for health and health for work objectives. There's no doubt that's the life and work in many respects his life. And that's kind of another topic. But try and love what you're doing, trying to enjoy your job if you don't, because if you enjoy your job then work is, life is an okay thing. If you hate your job, then work is, life is not a, is not a good situation to be in. So try and get into things and do something that you enjoy doing and if you don't enjoy it, you know, find some kind of an exit strategy. But that's another topic. Going back to this topic, is it okay or is it wrong to sacrifice your health and the short term to accomplish long term work objectives and yeah, even in the seal teams we did that all kinds of times a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:44:31       Whether it was in training or for mission, where our priority or our mission or our training takes priority over workouts and over eating healthy and over everything. So there's times where a hundred percent focused on some kind of mission and that's what you're going to, that's what you're going to do and that's okay. That's what we did in the seal teams and that's what everyone does and it's, and when you get done with that, how do you make up for lost time? You do some hard workouts and maybe you go eat super clean, are you fast for a little while or whatever it is that gets you back on track, you just get yourself back on track. What you have to watch out for is a pattern, a long term pattern where work takes precedent over health for multiple weeks, right? Multiple weeks and months, right? If it's, if you're talking about months, we're in a bad situation.

Speaker 1:          00:45:25       Like, if you go week two weeks where you just were crazy and work, it was crazy and you, you know, you know, your health took a little to went down a couple notches on the priority and a couple of weeks goes by and you cook food with, I'm God, I'm God through that and the, the, the hard seasons over or the whatever the, you know, like, you know, people in the finance world and taxis and they're just busting their ass for two, three, four straight weeks. It's really hard. It's understandable. And you know, uh, retail people around Christmas time, there were, you know, everyone's got their little cyclical things, real estate people in the springtime and the summer starts rolling around in their work. It's, it's, they're cyclical things and that's cool. You work hard for two, three weeks where you just have to get after it. But when that starts turning into months in and multiple weeks and then months and then six months of your health is taking the backseat, we have an issue.

Speaker 1:          00:46:16       Now, that being said, there are not too many jobs that consume 23 and a half hours a day of your time. They're just not that many jobs that do that now and what you might be facing here as you might be blaming your job for you being lazy, that that can be happening. That's a strong possibility actually, because you can make time for a 20 minute workout, right? 20 minute workout, right? 20 minute work. I'd like that. If you get 20 minutes, you get in there, shake it out a little bit and you do. But you know, couple hundred burpees go as hard as you can. You just got to workout that took you 10 1520 minutes. Right? Well, longer than that for me, but yeah. You see what I'm saying though? I do. Yes. Fully you d and then if you can do that for you, sprint, if you do 10 sprints, right, it doesn't take you much time.

Speaker 1:          00:47:12       You do go, go knock out three, four, five sets of pullups. Go knock out a couple of hundred pullups. How long does that take? It doesn't take that long. Right? Take you 15 minutes, you're done. So then maybe at night you just roll up there, you grab your Kettlebell and you knock out some swings. It takes you seven minutes. We're not talking about a bunch of times. So are we being lazy cause we're not carving out 1520 minutes, half an hour. You know a lot of people ask me about what the workouts I do when I'm on the road. A lot of times when I'm on the road, I fly into a city. I'd get there at 11 o'clock at night the next time, next day I'm working with a company at eight o'clock in the morning and so my schedule is tight. Why am I in the hotel room?

Speaker 1:          00:47:54       The hotel room, Jim's sucks for one thing and I'm going to bang something out quickly. You know it's not going to be an hour workout. No, it's going to be like 20 minutes sometimes. Now sometimes if I have a little extra time, maybe I'm not meeting with the company until lunch. Cool. I'm going to have a nice long workout of course, but if it's, I'm due to meet with the CEO for breakfast at seven o'clock it's going to be a quick hardcore 12 minute workout and that's cool. So you got to carve that out. And so you know, make sure that it's the job that's doing this to you and not you that's doing this to you. Yeah. So if it is your job, truly, truly your job is the thing that's making you unhealthy, then you got to fix it. Now what you have going for you is that companies want you to be healthy, right?

Speaker 1:          00:48:49       Companies understand the benefit of having healthy employees, not just from a productivity standpoint, but from like an insurance viewpoint. We, if we got to, you know, we've got a health coverage for our employees and all of our employees are our sick and lame and lazy and we're having to pay their medical bills and they can't work. It's problematic. So what you do is you step up and you say, Hey, you know what? We don't have a health and wellness program. I want to run it. We need a little gym. Oh yeah, it's going to cost money. Yes, it's going to cost money, but I'm going to save you money and productivity. I'm gonna Save you money and insurance. I'm going to write a point paper on that. I'm gonna win that one all day long. We're going to, we're going to put a gym in the lounge and we're going to put, we're going to put some mats in the donut room.

Speaker 1:          00:49:32       You know what I'm saying? So we're going to, we're going to do it when I think linkedin has a Jujitsu room. You mean like the headquarter? I think I saw a picture of they have a Jujitsu Room. Good idea. Yeah. You didn't even have to pay me to work there. So you've got Jujitsu room boy. Free memory. Yeah. So you get so, so go, you know, step up your company. I can about guarantee your company wants you to be healthy. So step up, maybe take a leadership role in forming the health and wellness program for your company. Get flooding. My, uh, my brother's company. You know it up. He, uh, he, they don't have then on Mattson everything in the office but yet yet yet, but are working. Um, it's funny though, he'll, he'll like, he'll do this, he'll encourage people to go to Jujitsu, you know, to the point where they have rash guards even. Yeah. We have a pretty good representation from frag at the gym. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       You don't, I call everyone from frag mom that trains, you know, and I had nicknamed them, well all of them frack mob. Hey removed from frag mob. That's America. That's their actual name Jim Anymore? No, your name is frank mob. Yeah. But that's good because it becomes this culture that kind of catches on where, and this is just, you're just so, it can be kind of anything crossfit or even spin, I dunno, whatever. But you is kind of good cause it's one of those ones that you can kind of come and talk about it and you know, choked you out or you choked me out kind of thing. You can choke your boss if he's there, you know, it's like that kind of stuff. It's really fun. Your boss. And they even have like rat, like I said, rash guards, the rash guards. Like if you work for fragment, it'll say staff on the back.

Speaker 2:          00:51:05       It'll have, uh, like, you know, they do like AI and development, stuff like that. So the, the staff one will be, um, what does it have on the sleeves? Like digital, digital circuitry. Yeah. And then the other one says, we'll say security. That's like, you know, friends of friends or the friction between the hardware and the software rash guard. That's what I mean. That's exactly what it is. So the soft, the guys who actually worked for a fragment have the software rash guards that has like circuitry and the design and then the, the, you know, the hardware. Oh no, sorry. This software is zeros and ones. Yes, exactly. And the security guys who were, anyway, nonetheless, that's kind of, that's like a good cause that's not really an official program in fragment or in a company. It's just, it's kind of the influential element of the culture.

Speaker 2:          00:51:56       You know where it's like, and you know my brother, he, he, he, he pushed that, you know, kind of overtly I guess, but it's more, it was like, you guys have to do this. It's kind of like, hey, you should come down. I'll give you a rash guard and okay, cool. And guys, and it was funny. There's a time, there's a bunch of fragmented people in there just going. Interesting. But yeah, that helps. That does help for sure. Now the thing is if none of that works, if you, if your company's just dragging you down and you've checked and double checked and triple checked your own discipline or lack of discipline and you realize that it's the work that is bringing down your health, in that case, you got to follow the procedure. You've got to find an exit strategy, create an exit strategy, save up your money, line things up, get the ducks in a row in the next queue because your health is going to be more important than everything else.

Speaker 2:          00:52:45       Yeah. Then everything else, all that money you could possibly make. If you've got to sacrifice a year and a half, two years and you're going to grind it out like an investment banker that shows up on Wall Street, he's going to grind for two years and their health is going to suffer, but they've got a goal at the end of that. Hey understood you. Sometimes you've got to do, but you got to at the end of that two, three years, he, if you, and if you're not there and you're not where you want to be and you're starting to decline in health, they're going to get some stuff that you won't be able to recover from. So make your, make your decision. Then you come up with an exit strategy and move on. Do something else. Yeah, and health, health and even like fitness is, is this thing, it's called systemic

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       versus direct, you know, as far as being beneficial. So exercise is like one of the few things in your little hierarchy of needs or whatever that affects everything else. Like if you, if you're an unhealthy person versus a healthy person, a healthy person will be better at everything else. He'll be better at making money. He'll be better at all relationships. He'll be better off. Obviously health wise in and of itself. I mean obviously if you've got some guy that's brilliant and really out of shape versus a guy that's an idiot who's in great shape, the brilliant person's probably going to make more money and do better in the long run. I mean, I were talking and you have to put them on a level and intellectual playing for, yeah, you're talking about the same person. Yeah. Then for sure for sure for your person and wasn't going to win, but so and compare that to the direct thing like, well, people would be like, hey mate, making money's important.

Speaker 4:          00:54:19       So it's more important than the health. But his thing, making money doesn't improve your health. Making money doesn't necessarily improve friendship or romantic relationships necessarily. In fact, a lot of times it damages them. A lot of the times. Health doesn't damage anything. It improves everything. There's not anything that I can think of anyway that health makes worse. Yeah. Or being more fit and makes worse. Get healthy. Stay healthy. Yeah. Stay on the program. You know what? Um, and it's one of those things to men like working out when you're on the road, that's a big one, right? It's hard to like get a solid workout on the road because you're busy or whatever. But there's, this is going to sound crazy but when you think about it, it's not, not crazy but sound kind of unrealistic where, okay, so this is what I've been doing recently when we went to New York for the muster and like all these other, some before I go, I'll research Jujitsu gyms and fitness gyms where it can work out.

Speaker 4:          00:55:08       Cause like you said, the hotel gym is like, if you don't have anything else in yet but you still have time, okay good. But our research, where are the gyms and prepare like, okay, how long is it going to take me to get their workout, get back all this stuff. And then you fit it in your schedule and you know the thing. If you don't want to fit in your schedule, then don't work out. Then if been health is not for you then, but if you're like, oh, you're asking, you know this kind of question where you know is it wrong to sacrifice health and all this stuff, that means you're concerned about health. Then be concerned about health. You can fit it in there. Surprised what you can fit in. Just like you don't have to get that good of a workout but you're fitting it in.

Speaker 4:          00:55:45       But here's the thing, you can fit in a good workout. You just got to make room for that and you've got a psychological when too, like I, if I'm going to speak somewhere at a minimum, I'll do a couple a hundred burpees before I go before I went to wake up because that just gets the blood flow and you're ready to rock and roll. But at the muster I, there was no break in the program. I went to 24 hour fitness. I've rolled a hard one and hands those and then we rolled out at the muster, which wasn't hard necessarily, but there's a lot of roles in there and so man it was, there was no break in the program, but the point is because I knew that that was the I, I made time. Exactly right. It

Speaker 2:          00:56:23       was important and I don't want to say it's important like it's the number one priority. I'm saying it's part of the, the whole what I'm doing. If it's not part of what you're doing and then don't be healthy, then don't make it part of what you're doing. I vote against you on that one. I say make time. Be Healthy. Yeah, I think so too. That's my opinion. But I'm saying you help people like I don't have time. My job is so whatever. Hey, if you straight up don't have time, then you don't have time. Help is up for you. You chose everything else. When we're healthy and that's up to you wasn't going to go ahead and go in on a limb here that most people you can make time. That's the point. That's my weak point half hour earlier because you know, you know when you really don't have time.

Speaker 2:          00:57:02       Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like one time, I don't know, two or three months ago we were, we came in and we, we skipped Jujitsu to record the podcast and I was like, man, we skipped Jujitsu to record. The primary is good. We had no choice. It was like, we didn't do that. We weren't going to get on a flight in the afternoon and we just had to do it. And so, yeah. Okay. Actually that those things happen. Yeah. So consider that. Right. So it's either skipped, you'd get to one day and get the podcast out or don't do it. We could either, we could have chosen, trained Jujitsu, don't do the podcast. But at that point, given all the circumstances, the podcast at one day, it's keeping you to just do a one day. It's more important for that one day because it's not like we're giving up Jujitsu completely for this, but it's not that are actually holding the line with a podcast.

Speaker 2:          00:57:48       Exactly. Right. And that was important that day because we were kind of faced with that thing. What do you give up? So what, that's the question. What do you give up? Do you give up watching a movie and room service? Do you give that up? Give that US give that up. Like I said, hey, if you don't have to ask, we don't want to go to hotels. I don't even turn on the TV. Yeah you cause I don't have TV at home. And so I don't know, a year or two ago I went to some hotel and I've turned on the TV and next thing I know, you know an hour and a half went by and I was watching some movie from 1986 this is going, you've gotta be kidding me. Turn it off. And you know what I always do? I hang my chalk bag on the TV.

Speaker 2:          00:58:27       That's my, as my standard operating procedure, I hang my child. Cause you know how they're all the thin TVs when you travel? When I travel. So you bring your chocolates? Yes. Chalk bag. I bring sweat bands for my wrists because I sweat, I bring a chalk bag, I bring my little notebook, I brings good on mobility wad ball to do some mobility work. And I bring some one inch tubular nylon that I used to stretch. Oh that's right. You're a good team. Like when we went to the muster I brought rings with me cause I knew I was gonna be on a tight timeline. I knew I was going to have to get some workouts done and I traveled a little bit heavier. Yeah. Cause I normally travel really light. But I had an extra bag so then no rings. Amen. No factor. You were there for a while too.

Speaker 2:          00:59:14       A couple of weeks I was in Austria and then came back to New York and then from New York to Texas. So there was a road trip. Yeah. Dang. See and you made it happen and you're busier than the normal person in my opinion. Kind of busy in from, yeah. But again man, I think you know how that old saying I think, I dunno, you might've said it might have been Henry. I don't know where I saw it, but it's like there is no free time or spare time or you know, worked at, there's just time. You know, it's, it's one of those Rollins, so it's like time. So there's no spare time. There's no free time. There's just like this time. Yeah. So you better just get on it. So unless you're like Peter, a tear member when he was talking about what Peter Theo was talking about, like there is no time.

Speaker 2:          00:59:57       You're just working the whole time. Like you can't even sleep when he's at med school. So if you're in that situation, the, then that makes sense. You're not going to be like, Hey, I'm not doing this part of my med medical program here though. You can put that on the side of the road to a park to fall asleep for an hour because you hadn't slept the nine days. Yeah. So there are exceptions for sure. But again, like if you're doing room service or you're, you know, you're watching the game or you're stopping at the bar or doing anything, I'm not even saying necessarily destructive things. I'm just saying things that aren't conducive to your quote unquote work that's keeping you so busy or whatever that are essential. If you're doing these other things, then there's where you can make time. How can one ever have time if you don't take time? I like it.

Speaker 2:          01:00:44       Next question. My wife and kids are quick to anger. Sometimes it's explosive like the Moab mother of all bombs. Other times it's a slow grinding war of attrition. Being a student of your podcast, I've learned the worst strategy is to directly attack there to fight emotional position. It seems like this is a good opportunity to employ the flanking maneuver. How do I effectively flank their anger without appearing weak? Okay. First of all, thank yourself cause at a period week thing, that's pretty much in your head. Really it is. It's legitimately in your head and that's the first thing you need to do. That's your ego talking when you don't want to, when you don't want to, when they hit you with something that they're angry at, the thing that's hitting back his ego, that's what's hitting back. So first thing you got to do is, okay, I'm going to check my ego right now because I'm going to win the long war.

Speaker 2:          01:01:38       In fact, you have to be careful when you stay calm, when everyone else is angry. You have to actually be careful not to come across as aloof or arrogant. Yeah, yeah. Like when people are getting mad, okay, here. Okay. For instance, if your wife is super mad about something and you show no emotions and you don't get mad at all, they get matter. So that's right. You don't even care about this, you know, so, no, no. So you've got to, you've got to give a little bit, you know, I'm not saying it a little bit of a, I get it. Right. But then we're trying to do is absorb. Oh, they want to get mad, cool. Absorb. Take the screaming. Give the head nod of

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       understanding in a Ma only marginally emotional way. That pretty much communicates that. I understand. You're mad at him. I'm listening and I hear you. You know, I get it. And let them get it out of their system. This, let them get it. Honor system. Then let them calm down. And then after you've given them the time to kind of calm down and settle down, and I mean it's a longer than you think. It's, it's longer than you think. Let them let, let, when you think they're calm, wait an extra 45 minutes if not two hours, probably two hours, cause they're not called to be safe. They just stopped screaming right there. So, and then what you do is, and then which dudes, you're kind of take it on yourself. You're going to own it, right? And you say something like, Hey, you know that thing that made you mad?

Speaker 1:          01:03:13       I want to make sure it doesn't happen again. Right. You know what can, what can I do better to make sure that you don't get mad about that, right. You take, you take ownership of that. What do I need to adjust and what exactly is it that, that I did that frustrated. What is it that frustrated you? What can I do to stop it? Maybe it wasn't me. Maybe you're mad at the printer, but you know, how can we fix that? Because I don't want you to do it. And then you know, so you have the, that kind of conversation and you know, you're going to slide something tactfully and their tactfully, because again, you're still dealing with like, you know, possible flare up scenarios happening. So you know, but, but you say something like that, you know, we both know that nobody benefits when people lose their temper.

Speaker 1:          01:03:55       Right? I mean we gotta be careful, you know, no one, it doesn't do us any good when people lose their temper, we, everyone knows that. Right? So you slide those things in there. You're given that kind of like a little mini lecture indirectly about what's happening. And then when you have other conversations, now we're in just a normal day to day thing. You drop things about temper, you know, you talk about tempurpedic, well, you know, it's a weakness and it's no one makes good decisions when they have them then those are temporary, everything. And so some of the dumbest things I've ever done was when I logged, you know, everyone knows that. But you know, you say you start sliding those things in there that it's bad for your decision making. It's bad for relationships, it's bad for your health, it's bad for life. And again, you're not directly saying these things.

Speaker 1:          01:04:35       You're subliminally saying even, you know it's man. I remember one time I lost some little dumbest things I ever did when I lost my temper and I kicked the wall and I broke my toe and I bought a home, a wall and the landlord came. I, that's when I s man, I hate when I lose my temper. And you start getting them in the, even thinking about it over time, and this is the thing, it's a long war and there's going to be relapses along the way, but you got to just hold the line, keep it steady, absorb and then flank gently to get them to salt start self recognizing where they're at and what their temperature does to him. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       tempers crazy. Yeah. You see people lose their temper. It's, it's a total loss of control. Yeah. It's a total loss of control and it's does, it doesn't do anybody any good. And when you see someone that really loses their temper, you're like, what is wrong? Come on. Yeah. And when I was a kid and I used to lose my temper and at some point I just realized, I forget what it was. I forget what made me think there was something my dad said to me, there's something about, you know, something along those lines of like, you lose your temper. It's like a little baby. Oh, loss of control. Okay. So you, you, when you realized it, that's because of something my dad said to me. Something along the lines of light, you know, I think he was referring to an athlete or something, someone that just had no emotions and how that was impressive.

Speaker 2:          01:06:06       Yeah. And I was like, hmm, that is impressive. Massive control over that. Nothing is going to make me mad. It doesn't matter what's going on around me. Yeah. Yeah. It is like a baby, you know? Like I said, it'd be, you know, like babies, they cry and they whatever, cause they don't know how to talk. So if they knew how to talk and control everything, they just be like, hey, I'm cold. Or Hey, I'm hungry, but they don't know how to talk. So why do adults go crazy and cry? Because their babies, cause they don't know how to talk if they, if they die for every little thing, they're babies. Yeah. They don't know how to talk. I said actually you know what, under any, depends. It depends how much controlling and all these other little variables. But it's like the front part of your brain.

Speaker 2:          01:06:46       That's the decision making. Like the conscious like, oh I can't, I'm going to make this dis this conscious decision. Right. Which is the last part of your brain to develop by the way. And it's like a conscious decision making be the front frontal lobe cortex. You know, something like this. And it happens and it fully develops around age 25 by the way. So if you're (242) 032-0220 one and all, and so put simply, it's like, okay, my actions not how do they affect the future, you know, it's all in one way or another. It's going to be kind of surrounded on that little premise, small little bro. So otherwise you're just going not straight auto mode. However your however you feel that's going to influence, not totally control, but that's the thing that's going to influence your behaviors. So Times of stress, your frontal cortex start to shut down a little bit.

Speaker 2:          01:07:31       Hunger shut down a little bit. Uh, hormonal situations for guys and girls. Oh, so you lose your temper more. That's where hangry comes from. Hangry is one of them, you know, and it's like all these things, loss of empathy and loss of like all this stuff where your decisions just aren't that dope. Yeah. And so, and when I say hormonal, like that's why you get roid rage. You know? Cause like guys, if they're on steroids, that's their hormones are up. Or girls pms scene. It's like a real, you know, premenstrual syndrome. It's like their hormones are all, so her, one time my wife started when she was pregnant, she started crying during an 18 and t commercial, Macula Jack Mood. I

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       was like, oh my God, what's wrong with her? Some of those are kind of sad. Emotional nonetheless, or why were you crying during Hawaii? Five O man. Oh, telling me they're training. They're trying to make it deep man, that show you're watching them nod anyway, nonetheless. Um, it's back to losing your temper and stuff. It is a week thing. So it's kind of obvious, especially from the outside to see that look, you're losing your temper. It's not cool. And a lot of people, they think it's cool because it feels good when you're a little kid, you respect it cause you see someone lose their temper. It's like turning into superman. Right? I mean he's feared, but right. You're not feared by you look stupid. That's the message conveyed to your kiss. Yeah. Losing your temper is stupid. Yeah. And Amen. Some people there that you could tell, they say that stuff with a little bit of pride, you know, it's just me and my temper quarterback is going to get me in trouble.

Speaker 4:          01:09:12       And they're all like, yeah, you don't proud. I'm a hot head man. That's like, oh me, that should be the guy. I wish I didn't. That should be. If you say, Hey, I just have a temper, that should be the equivalent of you saying, I don't know how to read. It should be that, hey, nothing wrong with it. You can get past it and you know, whatever. I'm not going to judge you for it, but it's not good. It's not a good state to be in boot. He's someone who can't control your temper. Just like it's not a good state to be in as a grown adult to not know how to read no judgment, but you solve that problem. That's a B. If you're having like if your kids have a temper and they're easy to anger, it's because chances are, I dunno everybody of course, but chances are they got it from the parents.

Speaker 4:          01:09:55       Keep in mind you're one of those parents. I'm not saying, I'm not saying that you have a temper. I'm not saying you don't, but I am saying, sure kids have a temporary, your wife as a temporary, you got it. Really honestly evaluate, do I have a temper and understand that cause the kids, they're just these little seeds of beings who were like, hey, how do I act? I don't know how to act all act out. You know, just how I feel. I'm going to cry. This is my default. I'm just going to cry when something's, so you're saying the parents have a temper and show that and act that way the kids will learn it from you're going to learn it. So there is some, there is something like genetic though I, well maybe I guess it could, we don't know if it's genetic or not but there are some where you know the father has a bad temper and then the kid has a bad temper.

Speaker 4:          01:10:39       Yeah. But there's no temper gene. So what it is is there's a genetic situation for sure that you're more apt to not be able to control certain parts of or not not be able to control but control less. You know, certain parts of your brain or chemistry is going to make you lean towards certain types of behavior, like impulsive behavior or something like that. There is for sure. But again, and when you're a kid, you're just looking for how do I act? I don't know. I'm growing up. I don't even know how to act. So the first thing you're going to look at is the people might be authority figures in front of you, the parents,

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       if the parents aren't there, who are they looking to? I don't know. The guy next door, the guy on TV, the guy up the street, the guy in the music video, whoever. I don't know. Whoever, whoever's doing better than me. That's it. So if you're the parent and you're losing your temper all the time, kids going to lose their temper. Yeah. That's how what they're going to learn that act so point there is if you lose your temper or if your kids are losing your temper, you start with yourself because you know the game

Speaker 2:          01:11:47       you're looking at and there's certain things. It's real easy to see when someone else does it. Yeah. Most things. But yeah, it's really, yeah. You simply don't see, it sounds like this guy here that asks this question, he's saying his wife loses his temper and that could be where the kid is getting the, the modeling from. Right? Right. And he's saying he doesn't. Now is there a chance that he does to probably, I guess so. But it sounds like he's pretty together and he's saying, look, I just need to get them to calm down. Right. So yeah, in this situation I'd say it's probably the wife who is losing her temper and then the kid is imitating or modeling and then we have this scenario happening. So what we need to do is explain to everyone in the family that it's not good. We're not losing our tempers anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:12:26       The, yeah. And the reason I say it too is, again, I'm not saying he does lose his temper, but I am saying that it is a possibility that because if let's say mean you are husband and wife and I thought we're just broken kid, me and my wife. Okay. If she loses the temper, her temper and I'm taking the direct approach, right? Yeah. Which I understand your lounge evermore. No, I'm going to lose my temper back. I'm going to go fire. I'm going to fight fire with fire. You raise your voice. I'm gonna raise my voice. The kids over there in the corner. How do I act dope? That's how I act right there. That's a possibility and kids will become antisocial. That's the thing goes on. It's one of the things, one of the many things anti social, I told you about that book called Mind Games. Small little book. Forget the author like pretty clearly and concisely laid out if you have anger issues like what? Up with that to insecurities changed my whole life. Low self esteem.

Speaker 2:          01:13:32       Next question. Next. Unless you want to go on. No, you sure? Next question. Jocko. Willink tech tactics to flank slash shift a ferocious analyzer from paralysis to go. Meaning what? Somebody who overthinks things hesitated. The landing and planning and planning and planning. While there's a couple of things here. If the person is above you or below you in the chain of command, so if they're below you in the chain of command, you, you know, you explained to them, you say, look, we don't need perfection. We're not going to have a hundred percent solution. We don't have 100% of the information. That's a good enough solution. We need to move forward. Let's execute. Um, and you know what? I'll take her

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       just things go wrong. Don't worry about it. I'll take responsibility for it. I'm not going to blame you, which is what you're gonna do anyways as a good leader. So that's what you're gonna do for their below you in the chain of command. If they're above you in the chain of command, guess what? Same thing you're going to tell him. Say the same thing. Like, Hey boss, we don't need perfection here. Look, Boston, we're not going to get all the information we need. We're not going to get 100% solution. We've got a 90% solution and let's go for it. And if things do go wrong, you can blame me. I don't care. So boom, the whether they're above you or below you, the chain of command, you might change your tact or your verbiage a little bit, but it's the same, same overall concept. You got to get them to understand that we don't need perfection, we need to move forward.

Speaker 1:          01:14:53       And the other thing is you explain the cost of not moving, the cost of staying still, the cost of being reactive instead of proactive in basically the cost of not being aggressive. Cause that's what we're talking about is a lack of aggression. And so what does that look like? What you explained to them that the longer we sit, the better position the enemy gets into. The longer we wait, the less we know about what is actually happening. Think about that one. The more you sit here and you're planning, the less we know what's going on out there. The things are happening, they're changing, they're evolving, the enemy's maneuvering. There's developments on the battlefield or in the marketplace and you don't even know cause you're sitting in the planning space. The longer we wait, the less time we have to recover if something does go wrong.

Speaker 1:          01:15:43       So if we sit here and plan for 47 days and on the 40th day we sat down and we start to execute, something goes wrong. Well we're not going to make the 50 day mark cause we spent all that time planning. So the longer that you're sitting around, the last time you have to recover and adapt and adjust. And the longer that you wait while you're doing planning, the less relevant your plan actually becomes. So that's what you need to make people understand. And then there's people that are just habitual and chronic, ferocious analyzers and those are the people you got to watch. But you got to continually just get through their head that the more we sit, the more the enemy maneuvers. And if we let them maneuver on us anymore, we're going to get killed. That's it. Pretty easy. Well, it's not easy.

Speaker 1:          01:16:31       It's a simple concept. It's hard to get people out of their own heads just like this is like everything else. It's hard for the ferocious analyzer to recognize themselves as that they think they're doing a good job. They think they're, they think they're actually being thorough. And you're a wild man. You're a cowboy. Are you crazy? No, I'm not crazy. I remember one time when my first deployment to Iraq, they said, Hey John, this is after I'd been there for a while. And they wanted, for some reason, they wanted to know the minimum requirements for us to go out on an operation. And I said, I just need a vicinity of the target and of radio frequency to talk to the local, uh, conventional units there. And they were like, well, don't you need air support? Don't you do this? And I was, I was like, all these other things.

Speaker 1:          01:17:12       I was like, no, we'll figure it out. Just send us. Yeah, we'll go. And there was other things that we would do as we move to a target. We align things up and weed, but we, we'd be good. But sometimes people wanted to plan out every last detail and that doesn't work. The details are not going to stay the same. The things that you're planning on are going to change. So don't sit there and plan every last detail cause not going to help you. Man, that's actually a pretty good point. I never even thought about how you say if you spend too much time planning, you know, and then you jump in the game, I'll late. It's like Dang, you have no time to make any adjustment. Can react better, go perfect. Cause he's, that's all he gets a one shot you got at it and guess what?

Speaker 1:          01:17:50       It's not going to go perfect because things don't go perfect. Eh, things are not going to go perfect. Not going to happen. Those sorts of things is flawless execution. Dave Burke just wrote an article that was on business insider. That's what it was like. Flawless execution doesn't happen. Uh, the, you know, he was a top gun senior instructor for three years. He, he, he knows about flying and he knows how hard they worked to towards flawless execution, but it didn't exist. The flawless execution was, was analyzing their mistakes, seeing what they can improve upon. That was flawless execution for them. It wasn't the actual act of flawless execution. They, you know, what they had for all this debriefing, flawless analization of what they did wrong. Yeah. But it wasn't gonna be perfect ops and it knows no such thing. It doesn't happen. So if you're sitting in planning that trying to make that happen, it's not gonna work for you. It's don't do it. Just jump. Go.

Speaker 1:          01:18:46       Next question Jocko. Got a question. He actually wrote that. He did. Yeah. He's fully gain kind of question. How would you do with a team member who tries to take all the responsibility but cannot do as good a job as others? I don't know if it's sincere helpfulness or desire of power and these are for power. Who see, there's a little twist on that one level twists that puts a lot on that question right there. And so you've got a guy that's, I'm trying to take all this responsibility for everything and not really as good as he should be to be in that position, but trying to take responsibility. And yet the person that's got the question, he doesn't know if it's sincere, trying to just help out the team or a desire for power. So is it helpfulness or is it their quest for power?

Speaker 1:          01:19:37       Where they coming from? How do we figure that out? Well, for one thing, if someone is truly trying to help the team, they will have an open mind to support and suggestion and help from other people. They'll be open to that because they're just trying to do the best for the team. If they're trying to take or maintain power, which as we know is driven by ego, very don't want help and they don't want suggestions from people either. They're just gonna do it my way. I got this. No, it's mine. So that's the difference. So there's going to be two different ways I'm going to handle this situation. So for a person that's actually trying to help and trying to do a good job, I'm going to bolster him up. I love it. The fact that they have some shortfalls, that's okay. You want me to do, I'm going to give him some support. I'm going to put some people on their team that can help cover some of those shortfalls. I'm going to try and set them up to win and learn and be educated while they are winning

Speaker 1:          01:20:40       and if they're humble, which I'm assuming that they are because they have this attitude that they're trying to help out everyone. Then while I'm doing this whole process, of course I'm coaching them and I'm mentoring them and giving them suggestions, am turning to someone that can do a good job in that situation. So that's pretty easy. You got someone that wants to take ownership and responsibility and they're doing it for the right reasons. Boom, let's help them out. What support them. Let's get them training. Let's get them knowledge and let's get them up to speed. We got an upcoming leader. I dig it. If it's an ego driven person and they are maneuvering for the power,

Speaker 5:          01:21:17       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:21:18       well then what I'm gonna do is I'm going to let them get humbled by the experience because remember it stated that they're not as good as they could be at this job. They're not particularly good at what they're trying to take control over, so that's fine. I'm going to let them get humbled by it. Now I'm going to assess the risks. I'm going to make sure that no one's going to get hurt or no one's going to get killed, or we're not going to fail a mission or in the business world makes sure they're not going to lose millions of dollars and we're not going to suffer coming to some kind of a strategic setback, but I am going to let them fail a little bit and let them see that they're not as good as they think they are. I'm going to let them learn about humility, right?

Speaker 1:          01:21:56       I'm going to let them learn about humility. Now, if they learn, if they are humbled by that and they realize that they're not as good as they realize that they're not ready to control everything and they realize that they need help. If they learn from it and they don't just cast blame, then they'll become a much better leader. You will actually help them by letting them get humbled. If they just get done and they just cast blame, then we see them fail and now we have legitimate reason to say, look, I can't put you in charge. You just failed. I can't allow this to happen again. So that's how I would basically handle that situation. Now of course there's all different kinds of gradations of, of those realities and the answer will be somewhat scaled as well. Right? So you're, that's what you're, do you scale the answer? Maybe you give this person a little bit of help, but you're gonna to let them stumble a little bit. You know, maybe you're not going to give me any help at all. You're going to fall flat on their face. Maybe you're going to bolster him up a lot, but you're still going to talk to them and say, hey listen, you need to step back and get more in the weeds on some of the lower level stuff cause you're not ready to manage this yet. You know? So it's

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       cool. But that's my basic overall concept of where I would be going with that. Do you find that like even with the expression, extreme ownership or in this case all of the responsibility, do you find that people get confused but you know, yeah, like people who will kind of get confused, you know how you say, okay take responsibility. Cause it seems like anyway, from what I told think, I totally understand what extreme ownership is. Eric, I told understand, oh I liked it. I like we were coming from on high. You take responsibility for the mistakes and the solution. Yes. Right. That is a dream. Ownership. So, and then, but then from what I heard, like sometimes when people ask questions it'll kind of, this one's kind of ambiguous, but sometimes people will ask it, ask a question or make a statement, comment, whatever in terms of take responsibility or take ownership of like not have the problems or the solutions.

Speaker 2:          01:24:12       But, but like before the mission, like this is my, this is, you can overstep, you can be, you can use too much extreme ownership. You can say, Hey, this is echo, this is my mission. I'll you how to do it. Push it from, you know, input from you. That's all me. Yeah. And by the way, I'm taking all the credit to when we get back, which is actually equally wrong, right? I should do is say, hey, I will echo, I'm in charge of this, but hey man, I want you to come up with a good plan. I think you've got a great insight. I think you know the terrain better than me. Can you come up with a good plan and then we'll get backwards. If it's a successful mission, I'm like, hey guys, everyone, look what acra did. And I, I tell the commanding officer echo ran this great operation.

Speaker 2:          01:24:50       I think he's ready to step up in leadership. He really did a super job. If it fails, what am I doing? The pointing the finger. Adecco. No, I'm coming back and said, hey boss, here's the mission. Failure. These are the mistakes I made. Here's what I did wrong. Here's what I'm gonna fix next time. That's real simple. So would you say, in a nutshell, extreme ownership applies to problems and the solutions to those problems and that's all? No, it applies to everything. It applies to everything. Because even when I say, Hey, echo, I want you to come up with a plan for this. You come back and brief me with a plan. I still take ownership of the plan. It's your plan. But I go through it and say, okay, this looks like a good move. Hey Echo, I'm looking at this right here. I don't know if this is the best way to execute this.

Speaker 2:          01:25:32       Here's the issue. So I'm not taking ownership of it, that I'm pulling it away from you, but I'm definitely going to make sure we win. I, that's the thing that drives me crazy sometimes with leaders is they don't realize it, but they're making excuses because they'll say, oh, you know, I let, I let me decentralized command. So I, I can't control everything. No, actually you are responsible for everything. And if I got three teams out there and you're one of the team leaders and I come to you and say, Hey, echo, here's the plan. I want you to execute. I still have to look at the plan. I still have to make sure that I agree with what you're doing. I have to make sure you're not doing something that doesn't make sense. Right. So I, yes, I do have ownership of the plan. Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker 2:          01:26:09       Like it's your family member or something. Yeah. That plan is like, I love it. Like a sun kind of the plan is the plan. You came up with a plan, you created it. It's my grandkid. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So you're, it's yours. But I'm still going to take responsibility and ownership. But where people, it's when your ego starts flaring up and I started saying, no, this is my plan and we're gonna do it my way. That's where we have issues. Yeah. But yeah, the ownership doesn't stop and it just doesn't stop when you're in a leadership position. It doesn't stop on everything up and down the chain of command. It's hard to do. It's hard on your ego for sure. Yeah. Cause it kind of seems in a way countering too, I guess if you understand though, they'll all the little subtle dynamics of it.

Speaker 2:          01:26:49       Cause you know how like if the plan fails, boom, that's when the extreme ownership is really going to show its head. If it's a super successful, flawless plan, it does it. It's more covert because it's more internal because you got to give the credit for sure. Everyone else, everyone will will sit there and go, oh Jockos you know he's, he's giving the credit to echo for the operation. We won't show up as extreme ownership for sure. It'll be harder to see and people will say, Dang, people know that I was in charge right then. Don't want me over all the guys so I'm still going to get some credit. Right. It, it's more covert, but it's way more covert and it's matter. It's better. That's, that's the hard thing. That's what's so hard for people to realize. They want so bad to raise their hand and say, yes, it was me.

Speaker 2:          01:27:32       It was my, it was my operation. But it doesn't help you. It doesn't help you. It feels good for like a half a second and then you realize you just deflated yourself. Is that kind of like when you make a donation to charity but you want like everyone to know that you did it. It's kind of like that. Yeah, I guess it's similar to that similar concept, right? Like in a weird kind of profound way. That's the question. I guess we'll just move on to next question. How just the profoundness of your last day to think on a certain level it's the same thing because you know you did something good, you know, or you are something good or whatever. But it's like saying I'm, I'm the most humble guy in the world. You know, I'm just here, down to here. And here's the other thing about this.

Speaker 2:          01:28:16       When I give you the credit for success, not only do I Wayne covertly in that you look at me and go, man, he gave me a couple corrections that were critical. There's operation and he's not even saying anything. So you have even more respect from me, which means you're going to work harder for me in the future and you're going to do even more and we're going to look even better. So I am going to ultimately win. Yeah. Because my team is going to be kicking so much ass all over the globe and people are saying, wow, you know this, these guys were just winning everywhere. They go and, and, and so it's very, very positive. Whereas if I took that credit from you on that first operation and I took it from you, how are you working on that next one? Not as hard, not as hard.

Speaker 2:          01:29:00       You know, maybe guy, maybe you're a great guy, but you're just a great guy, but you're still not going to go that extra little edge. You're not going to do it cause you're not going to get credit and you're not going to do because you don't care that much about making me look good as you would if I was taking care of you. There's nothing better than having guys that you're taken care of. They know you're taking care of them and they're going to do anything for you. Like they're going to do anything you, you, you know, and you'll do anything for them. It's a mutual thing. It's real. It's a real thing. Yeah. It's like the gift that keeps on getting rid of it is, is a powerful tool. You know, that's what the book's been so popular and it's, and, and it's, it's why the book has been so popular because when you, when you break it down and people see what it does, they realize how powerful it is.

Speaker 2:          01:29:48       And it's, and it's also, you know, another reason that the book is so popular is because we put it in a very clear way and it's easier to understand. It doesn't make it easier to execute, but it makes it easier to understand for sure. Yeah. It's crazy to, oh and someone said, I forget it might have been someone at the muster, I dunno. Could, could have very little bit on Twitter. I don't know. But oh, someone was saying how it's so interesting how they started to realize that it applies to their relationship with their husband or wife. Oh for sure. Like that. And I always kind of look at all this stuff is primarily that, you know, cause I mean who do it, especially now, who do I work with you? Oh, I don't have to, like, I don't go through these extreme ownership struggles, Pluto with you.

Speaker 2:          01:30:35       So it's more, you know, so to me everything up just applies to like your relationship with your life, whatever, you know. So and it all translates all of it. It does. Yeah. And when you take ownership of stuff, it's when you take ownership of stuff, then you can control the outcome. Yeah. It's crazy. When you don't own it, you don't get anywhere. Yeah. And that, that um, you know, you have a, I dunno, disagreement, argument, any, any ripples in the water where the instinct is to point fingers, you know. But when you, even though one other person is really in the grand scheme of things here, both to blame, I know that, but they do have their huge role in the issue and the problem don't do that. Don't even pay attention to that. All you've got to do is shine the light on your own things and say, don't, I mean, and how you say, don't be, don't be hard on yourself.

Speaker 2:          01:31:24       You know, like that kind of like the kind, I suck, I suck. It's not that it's no, it's like this is what I can do. Exactly. Right. So what's interesting is, and you said it from the beginning, but it is interesting to just watch it play out. So far it's almost fun, but it's more just real interesting where when you do it and you just keep doing it, you always do it. That's thing consistently do it. You just watch how the other person just changes and just becomes kind of the same thing. And before you know it, like the ripples in the water are pretty much gone. Yeah. And what's you need, someone in the team has got to start doing it. That's one of the hardest things. Yeah. Occasionally we'll work with

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       a company where everyone's like, oh yeah, extreme ownership. No one is actually doing it when no one is actually doing it. And all they're saying is like, I wish that guy, he had extreme ownership and that guy should have extreme ownership and I don't see anyone else taking that ownership and hey, I haven't seen anyone else taking ownership and therefore how can I take ownership? You know, we send out when we work with a company will send out surveys, you know, pre class surveys and in post, because we'll, we'll do a number of sessions. So we'll send out to the leadership team that we're working with, how's it going? And we'll, we'll send out a week later, two weeks later, three weeks later, four weeks later. And sometimes when you get a team where no one is taking ownership and, and literally you'll hear people say, well, the boss isn't taking ownership.

Speaker 1:          01:32:47       So how can I take ownership if the boss hasn't even taken ownership? They don't realize that when your boss isn't taking ownership, it is an opportunity for you to take ownership and to excel and to gain respect than trust and power and power, which is a good thing because you're doing things for the good of the team. So you want to have power, right? I want to have power when I'm, when I'm a team leader, I absolutely want to have power. And the reason I want to have power so I can distribute it properly amongst my team and I can utilize it. So we can be successful in our mission. So when you have your CEO isn't taking ownership, awesome, I'm going to take ownership. And when the rest, if the CEO is truly not taking ownership and I do, everyone else looks at me and they start to, I elevate my position, that CEO becomes irrelevant because all he's doing is sitting around pointing fingers.

Speaker 1:          01:33:44       I'm taking ownership of things and solving them. I'm actually going to end up in a superior position. Now, I might not get promoted the CEO today or tomorrow or in two years. But when this information gets back to the board or to the directors or whoever, they realize that there's one person that's mutually respected by everybody. And that's Hugh. Because you took ownership and when you take ownership, you solve problems and when you solve problems you win. But somebody has got to start it. And it's hard sometimes in some situations you get the, the, what's the word they use, like the caustic environment. Toxic, the toxic environment where everyone's just so, so defensive about everything and it's difficult. Those are the difficult situations to, to work with Bw. And all it takes is the transition of one human, one person in that team to step up and say, you know what?

Speaker 1:          01:34:41       This stuff that's going wrong is my fault. Ceos don't worry about him. He's got enough problems. He's got to deal with the, he's got a deal with the shareholders meeting. We don't, we need to protect him. You know what? This is my fault that this happened and here's what we're going to do to fix it. Here's what I'm going to do. And that just changes the attitudes. And of course you're going to have two or three people in that defensive, toxic environment that are looking at him go, yeah, that's right. It is your fault. And you know what you say to that. Yeah, you're right. It is. It is my fault. And here's what we're do. Fix it. Here's how I'm going to move forward. Here's what we're going to do to change. But it's hard to be that person to take that first step and then you got to keep that going, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:35:22       But again, man, after a little bit, you see the guy next to you, you started to do it, then the guy next door, it's an extreme ownership, the book it's pointed out, but it's not super crystal clear that when I was taking blame for the blue on blue, that happened. Everyone else was too. You know, those guys were saying, Hey, it was my fault. I did this. It was my fault. I did this. And that was cause that was, that wasn't the first time these guys had seen or heard ownership. You know, when we were going through training and something was screwed up, I'd be like, Hey, this is my fault. Just wanted to end. So everyone had that really good attitude. Yeah. So, and that happens in a company. So what you're saying it does, that's one of the best things about this idea, this principle of extreme ownership is it spreads throughout the company.

Speaker 1:          01:36:01       And will you get people on the team that will not take ownership of things? Yes, of course you will. You will get that person and eventually they will either leave or you will fire them. One on one of the two things will happen because when you have a person, when you've got the whole team is going, no, it's my fault. And eventually everyone's, Oh you, oh you, that's not your responsibility. Cool. I'll take that. Oh, Echo, you can't handle that. Cool. That's not your fault. Okay, then I'll, I'll take it and fix it. Oh, Echo, you can't handle that either. It's not your fault. Okay, I'll take that and fix it. Eventually. You don't have a job anymore, so if you want it, don't want to take ownership of things including problems. I will take ownership of all of them and all eventually take your job and your world and there'll be mine.

Speaker 1:          01:36:38       It gets phased, right? That's phase you write out like you weren't even there. That's what's going to happen. So yes, it's a powerful, powerful tool. And then the other thing is you see like you see politicians do it all the time. They don't take ownership when they make a mistake. And when they do, it's sort of this lip service of a, you know, it was my fault. It was my fault that this happened, but right, right. He bought blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah and tie and all anyone hears is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Big Ones. As soon as you say, but, and then you make a bunch of excuses, that's all anybody hears. Yeah. And there's just, it's so weak. It's so weak to do that. And it sounds when, like you said, when you get used to hearing it, when you get used to hearing people take ownership of things, when somebody does it, it sounds like Satan is screaming out of their mouth and, and just horrible.

Speaker 1:          01:37:30       It sounds awful. It's like a, it's like a coffin if you just sickness. Right. That's what it is. It stands up for sure. When we are at the muster, it's like I was talking about how when you start taking ownership of things, when you start having this attitude, when, when you feel yourself about to a mistake and blame on someone else, like you feel like you're gonna throw up in your mouth, it keeps like your, it's like you, it's like vomit is coming out of your mouth and then you drove it back down. Cause you don't want to let that puke out onto the floor and let everyone see it. It's not allowed. That's all it is. When you blame, everyone else has all it is, it happens all the time. And it's so, it's, it's the, it's like the other thing I talk about with, with um, stepping back and, and how you step back off the line and how much visibility you have.

Speaker 1:          01:38:27       As soon as you step back off the firing line, as soon as you just elevate yourself six inches above what's happening, it's the same thing when you start to take ownership. It's like the change. It's just this little change, but it just completely changes the dynamic of what is going on in your business and in your life, in your life. Because it's the same thing in life. When people are blaming everyone else, they're blaming the market and they're blaming their parents and they're blaming the, the debt that they built up and they're blaming the car that broke. They're blaming everything else that's going on and when you, when all you and everything, when nothing is your fault, what are you going to fix the answers. You're not going to fix anything. Whereas if you go, okay, these are some mistakes that I made and here's what I'm going to do to fix them, that's that paradigm change and that's where you start getting on the right path.

Speaker 4:          01:39:17       Oh, the muster your line at the muster. I included it in the video. Favorite line, I think it says, sure, I'll take the blame and I don't care. I have a mission to accomplish and I got to get the problem solved. That's what it was. Yeah, it's in the video. The best part of my opinion. I will take the blame and I don't care. I don't care. Bring it. Bring it Jocko. We've got time for one more. Yes. I think we do. Jocko on the Joe Rogan experience Everlast from house of Payne was on mls, was explaining how he wasn't in shape and Joe played the good video for every last said it is inspiring but it didn't always work. And the example he gave was a sick daughter who had lung disease that the doctors can't explain. I wondered the same thing. How's the sick child? Good

Speaker 1:          01:40:21       yours. I saw that episode as well and it's definitely a hard question. And actually to quote,

Speaker 5:          01:40:35       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:40:36       a song, a great song by Everlast and I, I haven't walked a mile in his shoes and I've been extremely lucky and and blessed with the

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       health of my family, my wife and my children. And I am so, so thankful for that.

Speaker 5:          01:41:06       But

Speaker 3:          01:41:08       I have been around disease and I have been around death and of course to say there is something good about death and disease is impossible to do, to to hell with disease, to hell with cancer and als and heart disease and all the rest of them, to hell with them all

Speaker 5:          01:41:45       and death

Speaker 3:          01:41:50       to hell with death. I have nothing good to say about disease or death. Curse them both, but, but then what is that where I'm supposed to focus? Am I to latch on to death and disease and ride with them down to the depths of despair?

Speaker 5:          01:42:30       I say, no,

Speaker 3:          01:42:35       no. I will not ride with them. I will not go down there evil path instead because I cannot find good in their vile darkness, the vile darkness of disease and of Def, I will not feed their fire. I won't feed their egos. Instead coming to look elsewhere, I will look to life and light and I will find good in those places I find good in every moment I get, I'll find good in every breath I'll find good. Making memories and holding them dear. I'll find good in knowing that I will learn from this horrible experience that everything that I'm going through, all the pain and suffering and darkness, it'll make the light brighter and stronger and more powerful, more powerful than disease and more powerful than death.

Speaker 5:          01:44:18       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:44:19       So cry and scream in, shake your fist at the sky and curse death and curse disease and shout to the world that life isn't fair then. That this is not deserved. Not For me, not from my child, not from my friend, my spouse, my brother, my sister, not for anyone. And then book up and breathe in all that darkness and all that evil. Let it all go. Peyton, when it creeps back again, let it go again. Let it go. Yeah, look forward toward the light, toward life, toward the future and of the past. Let the memories, the sacred memories.

Speaker 5:          01:45:57       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:45:58       Let those flourish and grow and expunge the darkness from your world and replace it all with good.

Speaker 5:          01:46:26       And I think that's all I've got for tonight. The rough one. Yeah, I think probably that. Okay. It's like, I think

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       that like, that outlook on it is, is important. Cause that's not just easy to do, you know, especially men and me probably, I've been lucky, my daughter had a staph infection in her lymph nodes in the hospital for like week. We can after them like that. And, and you have the viewpoint, you're lucky that that happened. You know, when you go to a children's ward and you see kids that are just suffering from horrible diseases, it's awful. You feel lucky exactly. As you should, you know, hey, we're lucky to have this. Yeah. And at, in that moment when we were in the hospital, I'm like, you know, like you're scared. You're like sad, scared for them. You know, it's just, but I think that just even hearing that, it's like, it's Kinda like, it does help, you know? Yeah. And it's one of the things that, you know, when, uh, when, uh, you know, when you talk about the reaction you have and you know, the fact that it's okay to like scream and shake your fist at the sky, that's okay for that.

Speaker 2:          01:48:01       And then I'm saying, you know that you've got to let it go. But at the same time, everyone's got to realize that like you let it go, it's coming back, it's coming back and it'll sneak up on you again and then you kind of do it again. You know, you got to, you got to go through that. You've got to scream and, and curse the evil that it is, and then you got to let it go again and you're going to go through that cycle over and over again. But what you can't do is you can't not go through the cycle. You can't just get trapped in the screaming and the suffering and the pain. You can't get trapped there. And it's really hard. And I noticed that, you know, when I had, when I had my friends get killed overseas, I realized, you know, when we'd be home and like everything would be normal.

Speaker 2:          01:48:51       Like maybe it would be out having some beers with the boys or we'd be doing something and all of a sudden, like you just get hit with this wave of sadness. And it would kind of just, almost instantly I'd be like breaking down would be that could be like ready to cry or crying and then three minutes later I'm like out of it. You know? I just had to get rid of it. I just had to expunge that sadness and, but what you can't do is you just can't get caught in those cycles. And I think that's what happens to people. And again, I haven't walked a mile in those shoes, but what I have seen is I know that it's hard. I know that it's heartbreaking, but you can't let it break everything. You have to try and hold it together. Yeah. It's like part of the like going through, I know this little low level, I guess I understand

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       it's like a low level, but part of like the feeling that you get is like what do I do? Like I don't, I feel like he can't do anything. And then that provides these feelings, you know? But if you start to, to understand what it is that you do have to do, and one of those things is, is essentially like understand it that yeah, it's going on. Don't try to block it or escape, do some escapists activity or whatever. Just know and understand that it's going on. And then on top of that, on top of it, your job is to be strong, you know? Yep.

Speaker 1:          01:50:20       You know, that's, that's another thing that I've noticed especially, and it happens with anybody but with some of my CEO friends that have been in these horrible situations, is there Alpha guys that are used to being in control of everything and used to being able to control the outcome and you all of a sudden you can't. Yeah. You can't control the outcome. And then what do you do? Well, it's like we learned from Charlie plum. It's like we learned from bill reader, you can't control that thing. The only thing you can control is your own attitude, your own view of what's happening. And if you're, if you control your attitude and you make your attitude the best possible attitude it can be. That's the best you're going to do. And again, I wish there was some, I don't have some miracle solution to these situations and no one does.

Speaker 1:          01:51:19       If we had the miracle, these problems wouldn't happen. These horrible things wouldn't happen. So what can we actually control? Who will keep control is our own view of it. Our own assessment, our own attitude, and that sounds like a trite word, but our own attitude of what's happening and make that as good as we can. And are there going to be points where your attitude turns completely dark and negative? Of course there are. How can you not? But don't let it be permanent. Don't let it be permanent for the sake of the situation, for the sake of the person you care about. They don't want you to live like that. So don't, and again, there's, you know it's going to be sick Sicko core from what I've seen, it's going to be cyclical in nature. The way it happens, the way people deal with these horrible emotions is they go down and then they come up and then they go down and they come up.

Speaker 1:          01:52:21       And, and when they go down, when your emotions go down and when you get dragged into the, the, the, the mindset of loss, then I think the best thing to do is just embrace it. Grab it, say yeah. And she's like I said, shake your fist at the sky and scream and then let it out. Get it out and then pick it back up and say to yourself, okay, that was horrible. That's darkness, that's evil that I couldn't control. What can I control and how can I have the best possible view and what can I learn from all this that's going to make me a better person with a better life to live the best I can in their memories?

Speaker 4:          01:53:05       No ma'am. And even men and men, when you're in the situation, like, especially with working out where your daughter is like, you know, in the hospital or whatever and you're like, yeah, I haven't worked out this whole week. It's like, who cares about worked out to your daughter's in the hospital? You don't, Oh, you didn't make it did you do to like, you don't care about Jujitsu anymore. You just care about this one thing, you know. But again, just like how you said, it's like, so it's like this big burden in life because really, you know, you've done a lot of time. Your kids are like all you have really, it feels like, so if you don't have them who hears about Jujitsu, who cares about working? I don't have anything. You know, there's no reason to even do them. Rarely. But aside from the fact is there is more like to your life and in fact the more your whole life beside them is for them, you know, so you gotta you gotta of you gotta keep that I think. Yeah, no doubt.

Speaker 1:          01:54:10       Yeah. And I think that's always an important thing to remember is that if you surrender to all that bad, evil darkness, that's the legacy. That's the example. That's what you're showing. As opposed to showing the legacy and showing the example of not giving up, of moving forward, of driving on and doing the best you can with life and with the things that are good. And again, having the attitude to control the things you can control and put them in the best possible light that you can.

Speaker 4:          01:55:11       Yeah. And it's a, and it's a spectrum, you know, I mean it kind of puts into perspective, in my opinion, why you should do the best you can when things are going good. Yeah. Cause they're not always going to go good. Yeah. That's my opinion anyway. Speaking of doing the best you can,

Speaker 4:          01:55:38       hey look, working out, we know, obvious, obvious workout. We're good. Hard to, you know, I mean maybe not every single day working on heart, but workup and when you do workout hard, you might need some supplementation. I think. I wasn't a supplement guy, I wasn't before you know this, right? I might've mentioned it, everyone knows, but now I am a supplement guy. Happy to say, not the kind of supplement guy who's like, Hey, take this power gainer. Hey, what kind of protein powder you take? But even though I'm not against protein powder, I don't take in. But nonetheless, you know what I'm talking about? Krill oil. I'm gonna say to my father in law's name is Ross. I'm sorry for not heating. All of you is heating, heating, his just advice. Can you heat advice or is it just morning? Okay. So you can heat warnings and advice. I should have heated Ross's advice. My father in law about the Krill oil

Speaker 4:          01:56:39       eventually chocolate turned me back onto it or further onto it. So I'm on it now. I think he'd be happy literally on it on it. Dot Collin intended anyway on it is the company. If you didn't know already, I get Jocko gets Krill oil from on it on a.com if you want 10% off all these supplements, which are what? Shroom Tech K shroom tech, good for oxygen uptake is what it is. So when you're doing these hardcore metcons Jujitsu, your body takes up the oxygen easier, more, more efficiently. Cordyceps, mushroom, just some science for you. Right then strong bone. That helped me. But I had this, um, and I kind of want it to report this before but I didn't want to take too much time and the jury is still kind of out on it. But so I had this tendon, itis kind of situation and it's weird.

Speaker 4:          01:57:33       It wasn't in like a normal place they can, your elbow was in my deltoid muscle where it inserts into the humerus bone, which is your like bone under your bicep. And it was like tendonitis, tennis, like in the kind of like I'm not injured, I'm not out. But I would warm up more. I got to rub on it and all this stuff and I'm lifting, I'm not going to take days off if I'm not injured. So Brett, this thing wasn't going to get better. That's the thing about tendinitis. Like if you keep lifting hard on it, it just simply won't go away. It's the whole reason this tendinitis cause you're lifting hard on it, you know, and I'd rather see it's not going away. I'm just going to have to live with it or wait for, you know, the time where I'd done, I don't have to skip work cuts, whatever, but I'm on the strong bone. I'm like I strong bone that's see what up, you know, do your thing. I'm not saying it was because of the strong bone, but nonetheless the tendonitis, it's not completely gone. I'm be honest with you, but it's pretty much gone. I'm warming up normal. I'm a believer of this John Boom. Thanks for turning me onto that check Jocko. Anyway, go on there. There's a lot of good stuff for a lot of good things from supplements and there's workout stuff on there too. So I already had weights

Speaker 4:          01:58:40       and gym membership,

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       but when you go on there, you see the stuff that they have. You're going to get some of that too. Cause it's not like normal like kettle bells, you know, there's all the cool ones and there's info too on this stuff. Like I understand that you know, a lot of people, a lot of us, we want more info than just Ooh joke. Who takes it? So I'm going to take it. Some of us that are like that anyway, we need more info so there's info on the website. Be careful. You can get stuck on there because it's real interesting and in depth by the way, so just be careful with that. You know on it.com/jocko I recommend the Krill oil. Big Time to me, if you're not on the Krill oil, you're, you're behind. You're like a good one to two steps behind, like steps, steps, not like a half step, like if you're behind.

Speaker 2:          01:59:27       If I had a twin brother, which I do, you give us a five year period, two year period, I'm on Krill oil. He's not on Krill oil. We do the same exact workout program, same lifestyle. I'm way ahead of him. When out of him we were more functional. This is factual. I that's it's, this is my hypothesis. Oh, okay. It's hypothetic Jadon curler. I don't, yeah, he's on Krill oil, but he don't have that same, he doesn't get after it physically as much as I do. So this, yeah, it's hard to have that for a basis of comparison for the Krill oil. Nonetheless, a good stuff on there. And the good thing about audit, you can, I can say this with pretty much with absolute certainty at this point is that it's the good one. It's good stuff because supplements in general, I don't want to mention any store names, but you know when you go in the meathead bodybuilders store a lot of those supplements or are there whack, they just have like sparkly like labels and stuff in their junk on it is not like that.

Speaker 2:          02:00:26       Um, get 10% off. If you want 10% off, go on it.com/jocko that's a good way to support this podcast as well. Another Good Way to support my pee. He knows what's interesting is get you read your review books on here. And sometimes, actually a lot of times when you have the guests, you actually have their book and you read their book to them, which is like a, that was, and I think probably talked about this, but when we had Jody medic, that was the first time it happened. Jodi came on and you know, I had this book and I was like, okay, well should I have him read this or should I read this? Or I just wasn't quite sure. And it seemed like the common sense answer would be, Jodi read this section of your book, right? Or it's kind of like a common sense answer and then you can talk about it.

Speaker 2:          02:01:17       And for some reason my gut told me, don't know Jocko read it. I read right. And as soon as we got, you know, probably, I don't know, halfway through it Jody said, you know something like man here and you read this is like crazy to hear. And it's true when you hear someone else read something to you, it's, it's different. It's different. Yeah. So, so that's what I've done every time since, you know, when we had colonel reader on here and he said the same thing. It's hard when he usually, you know, he's like he's saying the most unemotional way is that when you're reading this to me it's extremely emotional for me to hear. Yeah. We can, you know, but it's, and, and same thing with, with uh, Captain Plumb, you know, same thing as well. Yeah. Yeah. So it's, it's really interesting the way that works. And it's definitely, it's unbelievable to have the author sitting there. Yeah. And to have my spin. Yeah. Cause that's what it is. Right? It's my, it's the way I hear it. Yeah. And for them to hear the way I hear it,

Speaker 2:          02:02:30       they, it, it hits them from a different angle. Right. So I think that's, I think that's where the, the interesting, powerful part comes from. Yeah. It is very interesting. And it's interesting to watch it because, and you know, you, you're a little bit different than a typical person just reading a book, you know, so you really get the to me is what it feels like is like, that's kind of how the book is supposed to feel. You know, like when you read it or whatever. So you know where the point is like, oh, I think a lot of people feel that. So you know, they say, oh I want to go get this book. But they're like, oh, what was that book again? I got to rewind it. So anyway, you don't have to do that. Just go on our website, [inaudible] dot com there's a section on the top books, boom there they are all the books by episode whom you can get them in and when you buy your books through their support, the podcast as well. So boom, double, double

Speaker 2:          02:03:19       edge, double gravitational hooks. Like no, it's a two pronged. Yeah. What if, what if you weren't getting a book? You're getting like duct tape, anything? Yeah, so that's thing. Yes there are Amazon click through situations. So, yeah, even if before you do shopping, boom, just click through. We've got banners, Amazon manners all upon their click there. But most people they do the books, you know. But yeah, if you're doing your shopping as well, do that. Good software clubs, golf clubs, whatever you do cameras and some people don't. Some pretty cool high ticket, high dollar items. Yeah. Which is very impactful. And in the low ticket items, low lower cost items, you might not think it's a big deal, but then when a bunch of people do it, it is a big deal and it's a very, very helpful yeah. To the podcast. Yup. Good. With spark [inaudible] boom, a little bit. Also good way to support this podcast is to subscribed. Seems obvious. I know. But you know, if you haven't subscribed on iTunes, Google play, stitcher.

Speaker 5:          02:04:17       Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:04:18       What's the other one that I keep missing? I don't know. Hey man, whatever podcast those before you that I post almost. It's something about soundcloud. I gotta look into it. I don't think that that's the subscribed podcast situation. I don't know. They're just audio for, I don't, I don't know either. So she didn't even say anything, but nonetheless, I look into it if in fact people are committed to the side owned cloud situation.

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       Anyway, subscribe if you haven't already. Also youtube if you want or are interested in the video version of this podcast. It's been on there since number seven. I think seven was the first video episode we are on there, but they're just audio with the picture of your head. No, I can tear hit this button. Right. It's his face it, but yeah, if you're interested in that to video from back then I do kind of, I'm so bummed out we don't have it. Yeah. The closest you have is like a picture of me trying to low was it hall is the App Periscope? Periscope, yeah. Yeah. I remember that one. We did it go live on periscope. We tried. No, we did. We did. Did it live on periscope, Huh? Yeah. Just try and capture that video. I know. Nonetheless via video. That's the point there. If you want to see, you know, I guess what we look like if you don't know.

Speaker 4:          02:05:29       I don't know. I feel like the guests, that's where the value comes in for, she'd like to see Ryder Hayden, the heroes after it. Yeah. Right. Yeah. That's a good one too. Cause he's like, uh, like his stories, man. It's fun. He acts things out a little bit as he said. Yeah. But in this real mellow kind of nonchalant bad ass way, you know, she's real good. Um, but yeah, youtube, subscribe to that one if you like. I'm also, yeah, it's the video version of the podcast. Yes. But I will take a little excerpts and we'll post those as well. So you can, you know, if you'd like, if you're in just sharing little lessons with your friends or coworkers, whatever, you can do that so you don't have to share the whole podcast. I'll put some other stuff on there. Interesting stuff. I think we'll think up some other stuff just in relation to it.

Speaker 4:          02:06:18       We've been spit balling about some stuff anyway, if you want to see what that is. Um, yeah, go on Youtube. It's not like youtube cost money or does it? No, it doesn't. It's free youtube. Red Customer. Yeah. Yeah. We're not dealing with youtube red and we're not doing that. No. And I don't charge for content. Oh No, no, we're not going to do that. Not Enough. But I was thinking about getting youtube, Bro. All right. Yeah, that's a whole nother thing for sure. But yeah, youtube subscribe. You will support that way. That's cool. Uh, also Jocko has a store, it's called Jocko store Taco store.com. So this, I keep forgetting everybody's name, but very clever guy said, hey, this was, and then I went through and I was like, Dang, I'm so, but I was like, ah, it's not a Haiku. The Jocko story. Yeah. So why don't you change it? So it's a high coup because it might, yeah, I guess. Okay, here we go. Also Jocko has a store, it's called the Jocko Jocko store.com boom. There was like cool. Nonetheless, jackals store.com that's where you can get, if you want shirts, rash guards, hoodies,

Speaker 4:          02:07:31       some patches, velcro, regulation size and color. So I'm some women's stuff on

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       there. Anyway, the point there is if you like t shirts you want to represent, get a shirt, boom, good support. They're good shirts too. They're not the free time. When you put on get after t shirt. Yeah. Do you get a little bit? Yeah. You want to get after it mark. And actually the eight, that actually sounds kind of funny, but when you think about it's super obvious. So like, you know how like, I mean it's a litterer literature thing. Well there's a literature thing. It's called something. It's called something like the dressing of the warrior. Yeah. And you'll see it in movies. They do the movies. We should have guy putting his boots on him, putting his gear on and putting his sword and picking up a shield that's dawning his helmet. They do everyone from knight movies to gladiator movies to soldier movies in the modern day.

Speaker 2:          02:08:25       You'll see these scenes. Well they do it in literature too, so there's a little something that there's little reality to that. Like I'll tell you what used to get me was flipping down. Sorry, night vision goggles. You're wearing them on your helmet and they flip up when the lights are on, when you're, you know, you're getting ready to go. And then when it's time to go flipped down your nods. And for me, I like that was just games. So game on, it's so game on when you flip down those nods. And so when we, even when I got back from my last deployment, I'm working training and we'd go out, we'd still be on night vision, we'd go out at night to observe the troops and run the opposing forces and all that. But I get out on the target area and flip down my nods and I'd let go into full combat load.

Speaker 2:          02:09:09       It's just so good. So I think sometimes you put on a guitar three shirt you sorta feel or something. Yeah, I think it was gladiator. That movie when they're like, I dunno, it's like the emperor or something came up. And then there's like the small act of defiance from the gladiator guy and then all the guards behind them, they'll flip down the thing and boom, we're ready to go real quick. I think he's glad eight or probably it might've been something else. Nonetheless, he had the modern version of that right with these like, and it did happen to me when the first shirts came in, the discipline equals freedom. I was like, oh, the shirts there and I put it on and I want it to like go work out in it, you know? And they make sense. When you get a new rash guard, it's like where you get a new key or something and you're like, oh, can't wait to go practice it.

Speaker 2:          02:09:50       My new geek kind of thing when they were little kids get new shoes that can write faster. In football, when we split in Pop Warner football, we'd get the new shoes for the season. I can't wait to go to practice. Practice super hardens. It sucks do especially as a little kid, but you just want to, when you get that, that new stuff nonetheless. So like I said, chocolate store.com get yourself a new shirt. You get the one that says get after it. Guess what you're going to really want to do, get after it. Some other ones on there. Pretty cool I think, and the good their quality shirts. That's, in my opinion, that's even more important than what it says on them cause they're wearable. I can print like, yeah, Jack was cool sayings on a junk shirt you were at one time. You're like, all right, you

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       know me. Be aware of that again, but it's not very wearable. I don't look that good in it. It's not the case with these ones. These ones look good. I've had multiple people say it's my favorite shirt to wear it because I look good in that. That's kind of a shirt with the first round of travel mugs. The silver ones. Oh yeah. They were not as high quality as what we went to. They said no. They said discipline equals freedom on him and the silver mugs. They said discipline equals freedom. They looked pretty cool, but we needed higher cost. Higher Quality. Yeah. Yeah, so it's, yeah, essentially the same thing and you get the monkey like cool travel mug is going to go in the distance that's going to replace your whole cup cupboard. It's straight up. It did with me and I didn't even expect that.

Speaker 4:          02:11:24       But yeah, 30 ounces and it fits in your couple of doing your car too. What's the black on? Black? Black on black discipline equals freedom. No one can see it. Yeah. You except for you. Well, the owner. Nah, you can see it. Here's the good thing about it. It's black. It's east seat. Look at it. It's black. It's not shiny. It's black. Fresh and shiny. Black and then, yeah. Then the logo and stuff, his shiny black. So people have to look a little extra hard to see it. Yeah, but there's a subtlety to it that's powerful. It's for you. It's for you. It's looks dope. They call it murdered out and the car's black with black rims. Anyway, it looks good and it's double insulated. Dealt with. Is that double insulated is, that's what it's called? Yeah. When, yeah, your ice. You put ice water in there. You leave it over night. Next morning still. You still have ice water. Even if it's a hot night, even if thought day, it's amazing. I left my name, my car. You know, you go into the grocery store, you spend a lot of time in negotiation.

Speaker 4:          02:12:22       No, no. I was coming back from somewhere, left it in my car with I, it was just ice. I drink all the water and left it in. My car came out later that evening. Boom. I still in the car today. It's amazing. It's a miracle. Anyway, those are good. High Quality, BPA free, all that stuff. Anyway, Jaclyn, store.com if you didn't know already. Also, good way to support yourself and this podcast by happenstance is psychological. A psychological warfare is what it's called. If you don't know what that is, it's an album with tracks of Jocko telling you how to get through your moments of weakness in the event of you having a moment of weakness, getting up early, procrastinating, even being created. It's like for everything being creative, like how can, how can you get talked out of writer's block? How can you get talked out of that?

Speaker 4:          02:13:17       It's weird, right? You will be talked out of writer's block and right into creativity. Yes, exactly right. And same thing with workouts anyway for all the little moments of weakness that you might have. Don't worry Jack was there, get it. Psychological warfare, you can even buy the individual tracks do let's say your life just no, but that's not as good of a deal. But I mean really 99 cents. Yes it is a good deal. It's a great deal. Regardless in my opinion. Cause Look Kid, my whole thing wasn't the wake up early. It was going from not working out to where, you know how it's like okay I've got to work out today but I'm on the computer, I'm doing something. And I'm like this is important to exactly what you should really focus on my craft. Right? Yeah, exactly right. So the workout day becomes arrest day impromptu, you know, and that was kind of my thing. But so there's a track for that, you know? So if all I need is really that, try the Diet thing, I'm not that weak when it comes to like the Diet stuff. So you know, so maybe I don't need it, but I'm not saying to do that. I'm saying there's that option. So he gets the one, it's on iTunes, it's on Amazon music. Google play, Google play pretty much anywhere where they sell music, MP three online mp3s, boom. It's on there. It's called the cycle of people that want to alarm arm

Speaker 1:          02:14:31       clocks. So people was one an alarm clock or ringtone. You told him no, no alarm clock. If you want to wake up to like someone telling you to get up that, then that's someone that's taking Jocko. Yes, because people want me to do something like that, but I'm like, we already did it. That's one of the reasons why we did this. A psychological warfare. Yeah. So you, yeah. You download that Pacific file to your phone and then you, yeah, you'll make it make it to your alarm clock. Yeah. Yeah. Psychological warfare, Jocko Willink. Boom. You can also get Jocko white tea on Amazon and people ask if I ever drink energy drinks and the answer's yes, but drink Jocko white tea, that's my energy drink. Sure. Don't need any other energy drinks that actually SAP your energy. Once they're, once they're crash hits you talk away to, that's not going to happen.

The normal conference, you're waiting for the break and then you're going to disappear to your hotel room for like 45 minutes waiting for the happy hour, all that other stuff.
