Speaker 1:          00:00          Jocko, you've talked about how getting into into adversarial relationships is pointless, but people always get into adversarial relationships with me. I've been told them scary before but never understood why. My question is how do I maneuver on this without acting like a little weakling bitch for lack of a better term, to appear less threatening. Do I just accept that I rub people the wrong way?

Speaker 2:          00:31          So this is a question there. I'll do my best to answer cause it's time for definitely time for some self awareness here for the individual asking this question. It sounds like you are, you know, a big abrasive person that is aggressive and intimidates people and I know what it's like to be that person because I could be, I could come across as intimidating. I know that um, I can definitely come across as aggressive. I can be aggressive. I am aggressive in many ways, abrasive. I don't know that not necessarily uh, um, categorizes me because I'm very cautious about not being abrasive because if I'm being abrasive with people, am I building a relationship under, make any progress? The answer's obviously no. So something, the thing is when I hear this type of question,

Speaker 3:          01:24          okay,

Speaker 2:          01:25          I, I think that there's some little bit of insecurity going on here, right? Some, a little bit of, hey that's not an insult. That's what I sense. Cause everyone's got insecurity's I do. Everybody does and but, but the fact that you asked this question, I'm hoping that that means you want to make some kind of improvement. All right. Do you want to get better? And you know, I'm a little worried that you might just be looking for like reinforcement cause people think jock was big and aggressive. So if I say I'm big and aggressive, I'll, you know, jock, who was just going to say, hey those people are just scared of you and they don't deserve your mercy or you don't. You Do, you use your intimidation factor. Overrun those people. Right? That might be what you're looking for, but you're not going to get that here. And the reason you're not gonna get that, here's cause that's not going to help you. It's not going to help you achieve your goals. Can you talk about people being scared of you? But the fact likely is, is that you're the one that scared.

Speaker 3:          02:29          Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:30          In, in, you actually said it yourself, that you don't want to appear to be weak. You don't want to appear to be a bitch. Yeah. That is that feeling. That's fear. That's fear. It's fear of looking weak. It's fear of looking wrong. It's fear of failure and it's fear of vulnerability. And those are, those are, those are real. And if you're, you know, everybody should be feeling those fears. I at some level, but you have to overcome those fears. If you don't, then how are you ever going to step up if you're, if you're too afraid to be wrong, how are you? You're going to answer a question. If you're too afraid to

Speaker 2:          03:22          look weak, how are you ever going to exposures? Any weaknesses? And if you don't expose any weaknesses, well just build a bunker around yourself and sit in there by herself. You. So as a leader, we know that up and down the chain of command, you need to develop relationships, right? That's what, that's what you're supposed to do. That means you need to communicate with people. That means you need to talk and you need to listen and you need to develop trust. And one of the best ways to develop trust with other people is by exposing some vulnerability, by saying, hack on, I'm not quite sure how to do this. Or Hey, echo, hey, can you, can you help me with this issue I have going on here? I don't know how to solve it. That's ways that you build trust and thereby build relationships. And it's hard to do that because you don't want to look stupid. You don't want to look weak. You don't want to admit you don't know something because you want to be Mr. Strong and know everything in. So you're probably putting up a front.

Speaker 3:          04:33          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          04:33          an aggressive front and abrasive front. It's a wall to keep people intimidated. And then in your mind you think it's not my fault, it's their fault because they're scared of me. It's their fault because I'm so intimidating. So that is not good. And then you get the you're kind of closing statement. Should you just accept that I rub people the wrong way. You can. You can't accept that you rub people the wrong way, but then you might as well accept right then and there that you're never going to be a true leader. That's, you're never going to build any relationships that you're never going to inspire anybody and you're never going to be the leader of a bad ass unified, high performing team, probably not worth it. And the, the better thing to do is to humble yourself, is to open yourself up to the pain and the discomfort of displaying weakness and error and failure and open yourself up to try and be nice to other people instead being scared of what's going to happen if you expose yourself. Go ahead and throw it out there,

Speaker 3:          06:02          act

Speaker 2:          06:03          pleasant to them so they talk to you without fear. And in doing those things, you can overcome whatever these under insecurities are. And I dunno what the insecures you have. It could be any number of things. Maybe you don't think you're smart as they are. Maybe you don't think you're as well educated as they are. Maybe you don't think that they have, you have the strategic vision that they have. Whatever those insecurities are, it's all good. We all got them. No big deal. But if you stop hiding them and you own them,

Speaker 3:          06:31          hmm,

Speaker 2:          06:32          you will become not only a better leader, but to become a better man.

Speaker 3:          06:45          So take a breath and get home and take another crack at this gig. You know,

Speaker 2:          06:59          I think losing your temper is a huge red flag. Like I've always said and always will say huge red flag if you ever lose your temper. And I'm nothing screaming, yell. I'm just saying you're getting mad and displaying that anger. Well, what's really, what's really what's really bad is when people utilize their temper as a tool to scare and intimidate people. So they go, all, man, I don't want to say anything to Jocko on this cause you got to go loses, loses temper, whose mind go crazy like that. That's, that's me using it as a tool, which is not good because you're not building any relationship too. You're not getting any input from people.

Speaker 2:          07:35          You're, you're not respected by the way. People might fear you if you have a bad temper, but they don't respect you. They're not calling you up and asking you for advice. They're not wanting you to run their, their project. Yeah. No. And they're not motivated to do good by you when you're not around. They are definitely not motivated to do good by you and you're not around. In fact, the only reason they do anything is out of fear, you know? Whereas if you have a relationship with them, you could leave for six months and the people that know you and respect you and care about you and have relation to, there's still busting their ass to do the best they can for you. Yup. Glad when you come back to yeah. Yeah. In, in a lot of times, like, so the adversarial relationship thing, there's a way to look at it is it kind of takes both you to, to kind of cultivate an adversarial relationship.

Speaker 2:          08:28          It goes, goes for any kind of relationship, but, well, yes and no, it will. Okay. So, um, you, you keep being a dick to me, we'll say. And if I just keep being nice to you, even though you're being a dick to me, even though we have a job to do what it, yes, all in all that and we're maintaining the integrity of that. But I'm keep being nice to you. You keep being a dick to me. I keep being nice to you after a while. The way that shakes itself out is I'm be nice.

Speaker 1:          08:56          You know the next person. Yeah, no. Well, here's the thing. We're still getting the job done and whatever, but my re, my response to you, if you'd be a dick to me is not be a dick back or defend. You know, it's, it's just be nice. Oh, you know, it's a, where are you going to say it shakes out as it shakes out. The one guy who's a Dick stands out.

Speaker 3:          09:15          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:16          So everyone's being cool and when all is said and done, we're just dealing with one guy is a dick. So if you, if, if you cultivate the adversarial relationship, it's like, okay, you have this competitive situation now to people that, you know, or Dick or guys that are jerks, which ended up with, yeah, and let's say you were a nice guy to begin with. Don't become a jerk now. You know, it's true. So, and I'm saying that because a lot of times if you're like gay people were Crete, uh, creating adversarial relationship with me, you're going to play a part in that relationship, you know? Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          09:54          Yeah. And the thing with this question, and you know, I mean, even the terminology used, which, which is, you know, how do I maneuver on this without acting like a little bitch? Literally. So you gotta figure, not, not, you know, not the most mature person. So I'm, I'm guessing, hey man, you're probably 22, you know, 24 something like that, or you're haven't matured a lot and you're 27, but you're still caught in that, in that game. And I think a lot of times, you know, uh, people when they, when they meet me or they, they learn about me or I show up at their business, they think I'm going to be that guy that's like, we're going to just come in here and, and it's, it's always really cool when people go, man, yeah, I didn't think of that. It's, Oh, you have this approach that we didn't expect.

Speaker 2:          10:45          And I'm like, yeah, you know, and by now most people kind of, you know, at this stage and echelon front, and when I show up some work, people have listened to as they know where I'm coming from now, but you know, two years ago, you know, they expected this big sergeant slaughter type thing to go down these folks to whip these people in shape. And, and my guess is that the individual that asks this question was kind of thinking he would get some moral support from me. And I'm trying to give them moral support because I want her to be successful because I want him to go out and dominate in the world. But to go out and dominate in the world, you have to be a a chess player, not a checkers player. You gotta, you gotta think you gotta use the relationships. You've got to use indirect warfare to go out there and be blunt, force trauma and everybody, it'll get you, it'll get you, you know, it'll get you a, a quarter of the way there if you're lucky.

Speaker 2:          11:38          And then it'll, it won't get you the rest of the way. So just, just, it's no big deal, man. You're young. You got some learning to do. That's awesome. I wish I would have been smart enough to ask this question when I was a young, stupid 23 year old. You got some, you're thinking, you recognize that you're in a situation, so all you gotta do is just, uh, just start taking a different approach, a little bit more of an indirect approach, a little bit more of an open mind, a little bit more humility. Don't worry about looking weak when you, the people that are scared to look weak are the people that are weak. Right. The people that are okay being exposed are the people that are strong. Like I'm totally comfortable in my leadership capabilities. So when I have an issue, I'm like, Hey, I don't feel comfortable with this. I'm not worried that somebody is not going to say like, oh, well we don't think you can handle this, that, no, no, no. I actually, I know I can. I've been in worse situation. So what he got. Yeah. So if you're paranoid about looking weak, it means you probably are weak. If you don't care about being looking weak, it probably means that you're coming along, you know you're doing pretty good. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          12:40          Check. So you don't need a hard shell if you have a hardcore, but you need art shell. If you have a softcore yes. That is true kind of thing. Yes. Did you just make that up? Yeah, but I mean, I'm not looking at it like, Dang, that was deep. I'm not, I'm not thinking that. But that is a true statement. If you're, if you're fundamentally sound on the internal and the meaningful structure of your, of your being, then you can withstand attacks. So you don't need to put up a big wall. Right, right. You know? But if you're fundamentally weak internally and the fundamentals of your, of your being are weak, then you need to put up a big wall of protection. You need to go round and blow up to people. And he made me weapons up there to really keep him away from guns. Some of the, some heavies.
