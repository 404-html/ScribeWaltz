Speaker 1:          00:00          In a leadership position. Is it okay to take or ask for suggestions on solving a task or is it okay to take suggestions that stray from my initial plan? Yes. Yes. And I hope that this, that would made you decide to ask this questions cause you just like found out about the podcast or the book or whatever because this is, this is something that absolutely anybody that kind of listens will would say yes, absolutely. You're in a leadership position. You should definitely ask for suggestions, take suggestions, share the planning, let other people lead. Many brains be smarter than your one brain. That's what you want. You want to utilize the brain power of your team. Now the reason you're asking this question, little bit scary, a little bit of a red flag. The reason you're asking this question because you were afraid of what it'll look like.

Speaker 1:          01:08          If you have to ask, hey guys, I'm not sure how to do this, or you're afraid of of what it means that you're going to look, that you're going to look weak, you're going to look like a weak leader, and that's definitely, yeah, you're going an experience. That's your insecurity that's making that happened. Don't be insecure. Don't be in secure because the open mind and asking for suggestions and the taking suggestions, it actually makes you look like a better leader. I know that sounds crazy. It actually makes you look like a better leader when you say, Hey, you know what? Echo, we got this promise off. Not a hundred percent sure how to tackle this one. Can you give me a hand? Can you give me some suggestions here that doesn't make you say, oh, Jocko doesn't know his game. He's an idiot. No, it goes, aw man. Jockos humble. He's looking for input. He wants to work together as a team.

Speaker 2:          01:58          Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:59          so yes, absolutely. Ask for suggestions, take suggestions. Have an open mind. Disregard your plan. If your plan wasn't good, I'm not just going to hold fast to a plan because I'm the one that thought of it. That's not good leadership at all. Don't do that. Open your mind. Yup.
