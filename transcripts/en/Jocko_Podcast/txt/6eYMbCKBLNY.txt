Speaker 1:          00:00:01       This is Jocko podcast number 94 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. The black cloud of smoke exploded silently outside the open door of the Dakota obscuring for the moment my view of the geometrical Dutch landscape deserted, but for a few for Lauren cows. As soon as the sea, it appeared below us. I started to think about the flack and I knew that everyone else in the aircraft must be worrying as well.

Speaker 2:          00:00:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:36       When we crossed the east Anglican coastline, that slight wave of movement had flickered down the aircraft. As the men check their watches, calculating the time it would take to fly over the sea and come within range of the now alerted German antiaircraft guns

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       below us. The air sea rescue launches of the RAF dotting the water at precise intervals were pleasantly comforting. The narrow band of beach, which was the coast of Holland, had aroused us once again. As the flooded fields flashed into view, private Harrison had leaned across to point out the guns and the ground shooting up at the massed ranks of our aircraft. At the sound of my Batman's voice, which had been silent for the past hour. The men near to the open doorway had craned forward to see what they could while the rest anxious for the first indications of the enemy had twisted their next appear through the small windows at their backs. At first I could see nothing and I was stupidly aggravated that everyone but myself could spot gun flashes. Then came that cloud of smoke producing an odd sense of satisfaction, a reaction which immediately shamed me. This was the behavior of a small boy for all that. It was satisfying not to feel scared by it. Perhaps it was because the experience was not only novel, but in some way impersonal. Looking down the dark tunnel of the aircraft at the double line of soldiers. It was a relief to see that all traces of nervousness at disappeared.

Speaker 1:          00:02:21       We had been waiting a long time for this.

Speaker 1:          00:02:29       So that is the opening of a book called men at our Nim and it was actually sent to me by a guy by the name of James of federal and the book was originally published under the pseudonym Tom Angus and it was about this battle at this place called [inaudible], which is in Holland. And in the book, the units that are doing the fighting, they're not identified, they don't say what units they are. But shortly after the book was published it became very clear and it was revealed that the author was an individual named Jeffrey Powell, a British army officer and that the unit that the book talks about was the hundred and 56th parachute battalion of the British army who fought against all odds

Speaker 1:          00:03:27       and really with misfortune after misfortune for eight days during Operation Market Garden, which is a famous world war two operation, a bold and super aggressive plan and also the largest airborne operation up until that point. And the goal was to isolate parts of the German forces and to cut off what's known as the rare district, which is like the heart of German industry. And then open up a route going from through that whole area, take control of the roads and the bridges and be able to punch right into the heart of Germany. Over 40,000 airborne troops took part in the operation, including America's 82nd airborne and the 104 first airborne divisions. But the deepest, the, those that jump deepest into enemy territory, we're from the British British first Airborne Division, and that included this battalion, the hundred and 56th parachute battalion. And if you know anything about Operation Market Garden, although it did achieve some beneficial things, overall, the mission was considered a failure because it didn't actually achieve the objectives that it wanted to achieve. And as you can imagine, those that were furthest out suffered some absolutely catastrophic casualties and people taken prisoner and people killed in action.

Speaker 2:          00:05:16       Hm.

Speaker 1:          00:05:18       And, and this is only an eight day. This is eight days long. So this, this period that we're about to cover is only eight days long and you're going to see that it is, it is vicious and the names were changed in this book, but again, this is an accountant, an account from one of the company commanders inside this battalion.

Speaker 2:          00:05:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:48       So obviously the opening was them flying over to the English Channel and getting ready to jump in to Holland. And here we go. Back to the book, I braced myself with the open door, the first man in the stick to jump gripping the fuselage and in case a sudden jerk flung me out too soon, leaning forward, the wind whipped my face pouring over the details of the plastic Dutch landscape below. I could now see one or two cyclists dotting the otherwise deserted countryside. The flicker of the red warning light near my face told me that there was one minute to go.

Speaker 2:          00:06:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:26       A railway line flashed blow the pattern of the woods was familiar as the view of the stable yard from the office window. The air photographs and the briefing model of the ground had imprinted the shapes on my mind. The pilots were dead on target. More often than not. In the old days we had been dropped a stray, but these yanks always learned from their mistakes. I never saw the red light turn to green. Harrison's hand slapped my shoulder. I was out of the door. The slip stream hit me flicking me sideways and I fell away just catching a glimpse of Harrison in the air above me and the tail of the aircraft flashing out of sight. Then I was floating, suspended gently in midair. My parachute canopy, hi,

Speaker 1:          00:07:15       I looked up at the sky, choked with hundreds of swaying parachutes. Most of them pattern didn't green and brown camouflage, but other others in a galaxy of colors, red and orange, purple, blue and yellow, vivid against the scattered white clouds. Every moment more aircraft arrived arrived to disgorge, their car goes into the crowded air. Then I noticed the humming we were being shot at from the ground. There were Boesch on the drop zone. Something was badly wrong and opposed landing with the enemy firing as we hung from our parachutes, parachutes or tried to collect our weapons before we could gather into a cohesive force on the ground was something new for us in the British airborne forces.

Speaker 2:          00:08:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:03       So as they're coming down, they're getting shot at, he uses this term throughout the book, he calls the German Boesch, B, O, c, h, e, and where it comes from, from what I gathered, there's a French word that means it could mean head like caboshing or something like that. And it also can mean cabbage. And so I guess they're, they're their slang term, they're derogatory slang term was these big headed German big cabbage heads and he reduced that down to this term Boesch. And it's a common one for them to use. They used it a lot in world war one. And so this is, this is a hangover from that, but you're gonna hear it throughout the book. That's how he's referring to the Germans. Back to the book of sharp pain burned. The knuckles of my left hand blood was seeping from my fingers. A bullet. Must've hit me, grazed me anyway, but now the heath land was rushing up, raising my hands to lift the webs. I pulled and then hit the, and then the ground hit me with an uncomfortable jar, a bad landing. I lay in the sunken road listening to the bullets cracking overhead,

Speaker 1:          00:09:19       and they're right there. They get right into the mix. I mean, it's immediately into the mix. Obviously they're getting shot at and the wig down and then as soon as they hit the ground, it's on back to the book of Man with bloodstream. Bloodstains shell dressing wrapped around his throat, walked around the corner of the walking towards us just as Pritchard, who's a medic, finished his work. Then came a couple of parties carrying stretchers, the occupant of one unconscious, the other with a cigarette between his gray tight lips. They were the first stream of wounded men from a variety of units making their painful way towards the dressing station, which had been set up in the woods behind us so far. See, company had been lucky only for men were missing and a fifth that turned up late, smiling cheerfully. Despite a bullet through his bandaged arm. Another four or five were limping and hopping about on strained or twisted ankles, expressions of disgust in their faces, victims of the gusty wind on the droppings zone.

Speaker 2:          00:10:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:18       All of them would have to be left behind. But then I thought again, calculating the figures once more, perhaps we had not been so lucky after all a 10th of the men who had in plane that morning were already casualties.

Speaker 1:          00:10:32       It, it sounded as if all the fighting had happened on the far side of the droppings zone in the Arnhem jerk direction. Now the noise of the battle began to ebb. The enemy posts had probably been overrun. Neither news nor orders had arrived from battalion headquarters, but I knew better than to obstruct the radio net with needless questions. So first of all, you're rolling into a situation where you, you're on your insert and you lose 10% of your men that that's, that's just where you're starting to. Now, if I remember correctly, that is the standard kind of figure that when you're conducting a big airborne operation, like when the army conducts big airborne operations, that's what they figure they're going to take for casualties on the drop zone. Obviously they usually do better than that, but for worst case scenarios, that's kind of what they figure and that's where they're at. The other thing that I thought was cool is here he is, he hasn't heard any word from the battalion HQ yet, but he's not going to jump on the net and saying, hey boss, what do you want me to do? Hey, what's going on? Hey, where do want me to be? Because there's other people that are trying to talk and he's got to just kind of figure things out. At this point,

Speaker 1:          00:11:45       now he's talking about his own company, but here's the report on the net on the rest of the battalion as he learned, as he figured itself and as usual. Obviously I'm not reading the whole book and I'm skipping through big chunks of combat situations, but at this point he figures out what's going on with the battalion. Going back to the book. Casualties in the battalion had not been light. Two officers and a hundred men had failed to arrive among them. The plane load, which we had seen shot down another load had probably been dropped in the wrong place. Ian Hampshire was one of the missing officer's rumor had it that he was dead. The other was the intelligence officer whose job Jimmy Gray had. Now combined with his own, Jimmy could not explain the reason for the delay. No one seemed to know, and that's one of the parts that I didn't go over it in the beginning of the book. As they're flying in, as they're seeing flack hit and explode around them, you know, they see another one of their aircraft filled with their brothers go down, no shoots.

Speaker 2:          00:12:52       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:12:55       Now they start getting some coherent input from the battalion and, and here's what they figured out. Going back to the book, we would move as had already been planned in England, the leading company of the battalion, we've Leslie Doyle's platoon number nine in the front, some 200 yards ahead, followed by company headquarters. Then Luke Tyler's eight platoon. Then Douglas Thompson, seven platoon at the back. As I had expected, the company was ready to move. By the time orders had been given out, two minutes. We're all that was needed for the men to slide there and trenching tools into place, pick up their weapons and sort themselves out. No one had removed his equipment. It was a lesson which the colonel had drummed into us. No Man must ever remove his equipment when the enemy is anywhere near, no matter whether he was digging, sleeping, or deprecating, whatever time it may be, day or night, a soldier had only to reach for his weapon to be ready to fight or to march. Just once this day, just once each day, one man in three at a time was allowed to strips so that he could wash and shave and shave. They must.

Speaker 2:          00:14:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:06       The last man of nine platoon was disappearing around the corner of the sandy track, which ran parallel with the railway line to our Nim. When I noticed the colonel standing on the right next to the shell of a still smoking glider, which partly blocked the battalion's path. So there was paratroopers that came in, but other people came in on gliders, just big gliders, you know, no engine that would get towed by other planes. They're filled with men and they were just land these gliders in, in big open fields. Hmm,

Speaker 2:          00:14:39       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:40       Gray was by the kernel side and behind them crouched to not have radio operators and orderlies. It was the same as ever. The colonel's eyes were still, but he never missed anything. The unfastened pouch from which a grenade or brand magazine could slip the slack Chin Strap, which would fail to hold a running man steel helmet in place quietly there, colonel would indicate the error to whichever passing officer NCO was responsible for the man. Nothing was ever ignored. Safely out of range. The offender would mumble about the nitpicking old bastard. But the abuse was usually perfunctory and good natured, all of the new his ways. And by now they had learned that his fads mattered. So the colonel's running a tight ship. That's what he's doing. He's a highly disciplined guy and he keeps his, keeps his troops in check and as you can see they're not offended by that. Like they, they, they complain about it a little bit, but they also, they also know it's the right thing to do.

Speaker 1:          00:15:50       Here we go back to the book, although we were moving along our planned route, our role in the battle had been changed instead of making for the high ground north of our Nem, the whole of the brigade was now marching for the PR for the bridge to relieve the struggling remnants of the first brigade, which had been fighting alone there for more than 24 hours. One thing was certain, so, so they're, their mission had changed a little bit there. A Bridge and First Brigade was at this bridge, had taken the bridge, but now they're getting attacked at that bridge by the Germans and there and now these guys get this brigade gets the orders to go and help them go and relieve them. Back to the book. One thing was certain parachute infantry. We're not the fast moving hard hitting troops depicted by the daily press with no more transport in a battalion and then for lightly armored carriers and some half dozen jeeps.

Speaker 1:          00:16:41       Nearly everything needed in battle either had to be carried on the backs of soldiers or dragged behind them. There were no trucks just behind the forward companies loaded with spare ammunition. Instead, extra bandoliers were strung around necks and light anti tank mines swung from waist belts. Success came with surprise in this sort of fighting, the enemy must be caught unaware and crushed before they could recover. Inevitably, we would run short of ammunition if the Boesch we're allowed the chance of standing and fighting. This weary trudge toward the bridge and our Nem along the endless tracks was a crazy way to use airborne troops. Surprise had been lost long ago before the operation started. I doubted the wisdom of dropping so far from the bridges. Now it was clear that it had been a mistake, so they're, they're in a radically different situation. Instead of dropping in and holding some ground, now they're moving. They have to carry all their gear with them. It's not a good situation. He's talking about some of the guys are carrying it as much as a hundred pounds, which is a ton of weight and now they get, they get word from the kernel back to the book. He was able to confirm that the first parachute brigade, we're still holding out the bridge where the casualties had been heavy on both sides.

Speaker 1:          00:18:13       The Germans having already lost 2000 men, although it was not clear who had counted them.

Speaker 1:          00:18:23       Now as he gets done with that, he kind of gives some word, they're going to start moving down this track. So he's giving that order to this. One of his officers, Doyle and Doyle's normally, you know, pretty pretty fired up about what he's doing. He's a motivated guy and here we go. Back to the book, Doyle was not at all his in bullying itself. The task of nine platoon was simple. He and his men had to walk straight down the track until they ran into the bush position. Their first warning of the enemy presence would be the rifle and machine gun fire tearing into them. Still less were the two scouts to be envied who would be moving out in front of the rest of the platoon. It was almost inevitable that the first German rounds would hit one or both of them, unless the Germans were cunning enough to let them pass so as to kill more of the men behind, but without armor in front to draw the enemy fire and pinpoint their positions. There was no other way to advance. I had chosen Doyle to lead the advance because I was certain that I could rely on him. This was the penalty for being good at one's job. So there you go. They're actually walking down train tracks and they know 100% they know 100% that Germans are waiting for them and they're going to push down the tracks and the way they're going to find the Germans is when the Germans start shooting at them.

Speaker 2:          00:20:01       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:02       So they proceed down the tracks and now going back to the book, the expected happen happened the column of the night collapse in an explosion of light and noise from a wide arc in front of nine platoon streams of white, red and yellow tracer bullets converged on the stretch of track where the men must have flung themselves to the ground. Very lights and parachute flares larger and brighter than anything carried by us, swung down towards the earth, lighting the dark country shy to the shade of gray of a gray. November morning, a house burst into flames on the other side of the railway. It was too sudden for an accident. The conflagration must've been planned. Anything which moved was now visible. Overall was the noise, the din of shells and mortars bursting both behind and ahead merging with the harsh roar of this enemy Spandau light machine guns and the more sustained drumming of the heavier weapons. Now I could hear another sound. It was a slow rat, a tat tat of nine put tunes, Bren guns and the crack of British rifles replying to the German fire.

Speaker 2:          00:21:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:17       There are a lot of enemy in front of us. The Germans had men everywhere. So this is like a well planned ambush scenario and if you think about it, they had, it sounds like they rigged this house to light up and and be on fire and now that's backlighting and silhouetting all the friendly troops because it just makes you stand out because it's a fire behind you on top of that machine gun fire on top of that mortar shells are hating you. And here we go back to the book as as

Speaker 2:          00:21:56       okay

Speaker 1:          00:21:57       as the major here as the company commander, Jeffry Powell is his crouched down waiting as all this is happening out ahead of him. He's not with that first platoon. He's behind them a little bit. And here we go. Back to the book, I saw a single crouched figure running up the track behind towards me. Then I recognize the broad bulk of Barf, Bartholomew, Leslie Doyle's platoon sergeant. This was quick. Leslie had wasted no timing, sending back news. Only a little out of breath. Sergeant Bartholomew sank down by my side and began to speak. His voice is calm and sensible as usual is leading section would come under fire at a range of only some 20 or 30 yards. It appeared that the Germans had allowed the two scouts to pass on molested, but everyone else in the front section had been killed.

Speaker 2:          00:22:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:48       There were several other casualties in the platoon as well, including Mr. Doyle, who had been hit badly in the Fi, and it was only semi-conscious. The survivors were pinned to the ground by fire, which was coming from either side of the track. This was all wrong with his platoon commander, hit Sergeant Bart, follow them, you, his place was with the platoon. There were plenty of other people to carry messages. Not only that, but Bartholomew could hardly have had time to verify the disastrous information about the leading section. It was far too light, far from likely that every man in it had been killed.

Speaker 1:          00:23:27       So Bartholomew's nerve had broken in the first test. So that's a situation this guy ran and he comes back and reports in and says, you know, hey, everyone's dead. And he's, he realizes he, the company commander realizes that not true. Going back to the book, perhaps the responsibility had been too much for him. Whatever it was. He was certainly scared despite a success in concealing the fact the sergeant had run away leaving the platoon to its own devices. I was flabbergasted of all the end pose. I had judged this cool reserved man to be the most dependable, a hard taskmaster, too ruthless to be popular. Sergeant Bartholomew had been an effective foil to the easy going and friendly Doyle and the two men had formed a fine team. It was incredible that this should have happened in the light of a flare. I studied the sergeants face. There was nothing to be seen. Bartholomew returned my glaze with steady eyes. There could be no point in my further destroying the man's self. Self respect. It was possible that he might recover after this first shock. Has Pride taking charge to control his fear?

Speaker 2:          00:24:51       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:24:53       so my rebuke was restrained no more than a comment that Bartholomew illustrative sent private Jones back with the news and not come himself.

Speaker 1:          00:25:02       Then I stood up once again told Robert who had appeared by my side to take charge and started down the track toward the forward platoon, motioning Bart following meal to accompany me. There was no need to say anything to Harrison who automatically rose to his feet. His sten cradled in his elbow ready to shoot. So interesting leadership dynamic there. Instead of saying you coward, you quit, he doesn't do that. Instead he, he really tones it back and says he should have said Jones instead. He's hoping that this guy will recover and this is a great line. His pride taking charge to control his fear, meaning this guy just has no pride at this point. He's trying to keep it together, but hopefully the cap, the, the company commander is thinking that, okay, this guy, we'll get it back together hopefully and we'll be able to utilize them as opposed to me just dropping the hammer on him right now. In which case he might just completely break and be worthless. And the other thing, and I, I tried to include as much as I could have this guy, Harrison, that gets mentioned, who's sort of the the the company commanders, right hand guy, but he's just always there, always ready, always stepping up and making things happen.

Speaker 2:          00:26:19       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:26:26       Now,

Speaker 1:          00:26:28       eventually as all that unfolds, we're going back to the book Nesbitt, which is one of the guys in that, in that platoon, Nesbitt had decided that it was time to leave and had used the lol to bring back the survivors of the platoon. Two men were dead. While nothing was known of the fate, the two scouts with Nesbitt, we're five wounded men, two of whom including his officer were being carried Leslie and shocking pain from a shattered fi, which morphea had done little to help, had fainted after a few yards and was still unconscious. A third of the platoon were casualties. It was bad, but not as quite as bad as pictured by Bartholomew. I could not blame Nesbitt for withdrawing without permission. Short of ammunition with their officer wounded and the platoon sergeant unaccountably missing. The men had heard nothing of the troops behind them for the past hour and had concluded that the battalion must've pulled back. Nesbitt had seen a lot of war as this DCM. One in Crete testified. He understood it's muddle. He knew it was rare for a battle to go as planned. His responsibility was to his men to rescue them from what seemed to be a mess. This he had done and his judgment had been correct.

Speaker 1:          00:27:50       They were no place to be caught at daylight, overlooked on a forward slope and unencumbered with wounded men. So you see decentralized command in action right there. Nesbitt doesn't here. It doesn't know what's going on. He makes a decision. I'm getting these guys out of here and what's good is the company commander supports, Hey, do he made a good call? That was the right thing to do.

Speaker 2:          00:28:10       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:28:14       Now at this point, they're moving backed. They're moving back after they've confirmed, you know, they'd pushed forward trying to find out where the Germans were and now they're moving back because they realize that the Germans are absolutely holding strong. So they'd had done this push forward. They've got basically ambushed and now they'd pulled back after, you know, like I said, confirming where the Germans were back to the book to accomplish this meaning to accomplish finding out where the Germans were to accomplish this had cost us Leslie Doyle and the absent bar following meal, while two men and Doyle's leading section were dead and the two scouts were missing, probably either killed or made prisoner, seven other men had been wounded, including another sergeant. This was a total of 13 casualties with another nine men lost when we landed with nothing at all accomplished over 20 men had already been killed or injured and now the battalion was moving in the wrong direction back the way we had come.

Speaker 2:          00:29:17       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:29:18       and you're going to, you're going to find, I mean, this is what makes this story so d so devastating is that it? You know, I talk about Murphy's law and things go wrong. These guys are complete. It's just Murphy's law over and over again and

Speaker 2:          00:29:35       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:36       In most of the books that we read on here, there's triumph and there's a victory at the end. And you can see right now already where this has headache and we got 20 guys wounded or killed and instead of moving forward, we're actually moving backward.

Speaker 2:          00:29:50       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:29:54       Back to the book. Sooner than expected, we reached the battalion base. It had been cited in a rectangular patch of wood about 20 acres inside line just north of the railway.

Speaker 2:          00:30:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:06       It was 2:30 AM a horrible hour especially. So if one is tired, cold and hungry, thank God it would be starting to get light and a couple of hours. What would happen tomorrow? Something had gone very wrong indeed by now we should be dug in on the high ground north of art, him waiting for the Germans to counter attack the bridges. Instead we were sitting here in the woods only a few miles from where we had dropped with strong enemy forces between ourselves and the city where the men of First Brigade must be fighting for their lives. Wherever one turned. There seem to be German troops and good ones at that. The men who had stopped us, had not behaved like rear area troops scrape together to put up some sort of resistance, but it fought with skill and tenacity. The slit trenches were dug and everyone except for the double centuries in each section and the officers and NCOs on duty was sound asleep. The men hump like dogs, some curled up with a companion for warmth lying in their full equipment, their weapons tied to their risks by the slings. I should be asleep to not sitting in worrying, feeling sorry for myself, for trying to get some rest and preparation for the coming day.

Speaker 1:          00:31:31       Stand to would be at zero for 30 hours, half an hour before first light when everyone would be awake and ready and this slit weapon poised for a possible dawn attack. So they're dug in and of course it's not looking good at this point. They're going to stand to at zero four 30 which is pretty common. Going to be up before the sunrise and you want to be up before the enemy as well.

Speaker 2:          00:32:02       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:32:05       Now they get together and get some word. Here we go back to the book. It did not take long. He did not take the colonel long to give us our orders. The brigade was to renew its effort to reach the bridge and bring relief to the men still fighting there, so pretty simple, straightforward goal

Speaker 2:          00:32:24       and

Speaker 1:          00:32:26       in order to achieve this goal, they set up to do an attack on this little section of woods where they think there's a bunch of Germans in here. We go back to the book. The leading sections plunged into the wood and disappeared. There were no there at all.

Speaker 2:          00:32:41       The information from brigade must've been wrong. We had attacked and taken an empty position. Never was there such an anticlimax, but never was an anticlimax. More welcome.

Speaker 1:          00:32:56       Now we get a little visit up on the front lines. Here we go. Back to the book. As the small spare figure stepped out of the first vehicle, I realized that it was the first time I had seen the brigadier commander since we left England. He was just the same as ever. Relaxed and smiling. Battle was nothing new to him. He had been through the worst of the desert war muddle in no way disconcerted him, at least not outwardly. It's interesting. He uses the term, muddle it. He's talking about the fog of war. This model, when you don't really know what's happening, and he talks about how the veterans are used to it in a co and and accustomed to it and they can deal with it, muddle in no way, disconcerted him, at least not outwardly. He seemed to anticipate it. Understanding how judgment and behavior was impaired by danger.

Speaker 1:          00:33:47       Wherever he went, he inspired confidence with his gentle eyes and friendly manner for regular cavalry officer. His background was unusual. He had come to his regimen, not from Sandhurst but from Oxford with a double first and fluency and a half a dozen languages, and I love this line right here. He wore his learning light neat lightly as he did his decorations, meaning this guy is highly educated and highly decorated, but you don't even know it. It was rare for soldiers to be aware of officers more senior than the colonels who commanded their battalions, but every man in the brigade would recognize, could recognize a name to brigadier. The two visitors did not stay long, but their appearance was a tonic for all. It was a reminder that that there were able men in charge even though the battle was developing in a rather odd manner.

Speaker 2:          00:34:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:46       Now as they, as he continues in these situation, back to the book, suddenly my preoccupation, my preoccupation with the problems of others ceased. There was a familiar wine overhead and I found my self propelled into the half dug a trench all but on top of Galbraith and Robert, the action had been reflex. I knew that I had made no conscious decision to jump as I lay there with my second in commands and trenching tool, carving into a ridge and my left buttock, the mortar bomb burst about eight feet to the right, the scream of the shards of jagged metal passing. Just overhead flailed my years as earth and stones spattered down on top of us. The stench of high explosive filled my filled the trench. My face I found was pressed into the course material of corporal Galbraith's battle trousers. Gingerly raising my head, I peered over the low parapet at the foot of the tree of a tree, some 15 yards away, lay emotionless heap, a green and khaki bundle, which did not stir.

Speaker 2:          00:35:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:53       Jumping out of the trench, I ran across and turned over the limp body.

Speaker 2:          00:35:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:57       The head fell back to show the open staring eyes of Sergeant Hawks, one of the seven platoon section commanders, a bright young, a NCO only just promoted who had been with the battalion since the day it was raised.

Speaker 2:          00:36:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:12       He was another old friend. At first I could see no sign of injury, but then I noticed the small hole in the back of hawks helmet and the thin stream of blood streaking the back of his neck.

Speaker 2:          00:36:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:25       Lying by hugging side, I seem to count seven explosions all just a little further away than the first, but still close enough to smell the hot gases. There was a short pause and then as if it were not an afterthought and eighth bomb struck the branches of the tree just above us directing. It's hot metal splinters down to the trenches below.

Speaker 2:          00:36:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:46       A half strangled it's cry of distress. Brought my head up just in time to see Corporal Pritchard clamber out of his slit and rate your race across the, towards the CRI has half a sack of medical supplies marked with its red cross dangling from his hand. The pause lasted no more than a half a minute. Again, the wine again, I ducked. This was the covering fire for a counter attack or the, was this the covering fire for a counter attack or where the Boesch merely harassing us? Spitefully

Speaker 2:          00:37:16       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:17       But when I raised my head from Higgins, from Huggins boots to look around, I was relieved to see one of the seven platoon Bren gunners, his helmet and i's just above the level of the parapet gazing down the track towards his front.

Speaker 2:          00:37:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:30       So the centuries we're still doing their job. The fire was not forcing their heads down. If there, if this was the covering fire for an attack, we would not be caught unawares. So that's the standard procedure right here for the Germans and really for anyone it's covered move, right? We put in big bonds, we put in mortars, we put her on in artillery and while you're hiding and while you're ducking down so you don't get killed, they maneuver it and then write it right. When they get so close that they're in danger of their own artillery, the artillery stops and then they proceed with the assault. Here we go. The low. Now there is a law of the law provided a chance to finish digging. There was no longer any need to persuade the pen to dig faster. The lesson had really been driven home. We'd been dating for no more than a few minutes when the sound of firing to the north slackened, but the noise from the vehicles in front had increased. The thought of guns only a few hundred yards away was punctuated by the hammering of brands. By the way, brands, I don't think I've said this, brands are sort of the uh, weapon, a British machine gun versus the, the span now, which is, which is the German machine guns and they use the Brits and the Americans use the term spanned out to talk about basically heavy machine, heavier machine guns. But,

Speaker 1:          00:38:52       but that's what they're talking about when you're talking about spend out. And then a brand is the Brit machine gun. Both Ford platoons were inaction and I had placed company headquarters too far back to be able to see what was happening. The walkie talkies were silent, also quite worried about the sitting of the full tune, some 300 yards apart, each isolated in its own corner of the woods and unable to support the others against a determined attack. This is so important for tactical leaders out there. Think about these lessons and these are lessons that I talk about all the time. And these are lessons that I used to have to teach all the time. So you've got your platoons, they're out there doing something. You need to be close enough that you have communications with them. So that you actually understands what's happening. And this is the same in the business world.

Speaker 1:          00:39:44       If you put yourself in a position to where you can't, well you don't understand what's happening in the field, then you're not going to be able to help. You're not gonna be able to support, you're not going to be able to, to understand what's happening. So you can make decisions. Mm. So in this point, he's positioned himself too far away. On top of that, he's positioned his platoons too far apart from each other. So if you're too far apart from each other, you can't cover for each other. If you can't cover, you can't move. And if you can't move, you can't win. So those are critical points. Make sure your command position is close enough, not so close that you're getting in the firefight. Note, not so close that you're pinned down, but close enough so that you understand what is happening. And then if you have multiple elements in the field, do you get them close enough to each other that they can support each other? Always.

Speaker 1:          00:40:43       He sees a guy running back and here we go. Back to the book, it was sergeant prior, one of Nesbitt section commanders are rather sulky, man able and well educated, but with a grudge against authority. And his left lefthand prior grasp is sten in a grip. So from that the knuckles showed blue under the under the sunburn. His right arm from which clothing had been caught away at the shoulder was thrust into the front of his smock. The elbow covered by a blood stain dressing. His face was white with shock and taught with pain. A morphine injection was doing little to alleviate the agony of an elbow smashed by a bullet.

Speaker 2:          00:41:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:21       The news prior brought was serious. The vehicles which we could here we're Boesch armor driving backwards and forward along the road and sweeping the front of nine paltunes position secure from retaliation. So far, the armor head only claimed prior, but sergeant Avondale had been killed by a mortar fragment as he dashed across between a couple of trees to put some question to Nesbitt. This inexhaustible loss of skilled leaders was serious in our parachute battalions on like usual infantry units, section leaders ranked as sergeants, not corporals. Nine platoon had now lost, not only it's officer, but three of its four sergeants as well. Hawks was dead and one of seven platoon section commanders had failed to appear at the rendezvous after the drop already nearly half the sergeants had become casualties. This is just a nightmare unfolding.

Speaker 2:          00:42:28       Hm.

Speaker 1:          00:42:33       Back to the book. After we'd put the final touches on our slit trenches, time was found a scrape, a shallow grave for sergeant hawks. It was hard to suppress one's revulsion at touching the body of someone I had known so well, but just as I was stealing myself to do so. Huggin step forward, ripped open the dead man's smock and shirt and slipped one of the two identity disks over the blood stained head, the sergeant major then unbuckled his watch and search the pockets for anything which might be useful. A Morpheus syringe and a field dressing, a bar of chocolate and a couple of mills grenades, two packets of cigarettes, and a box of matches. A couple of maps and a pocket knife. There was nothing personal except for a grubby on envelope containing a half a dozen faded in dog geared snapshots of the stout smiling girl holding a baby.

Speaker 2:          00:43:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:27       Before buttoning the envelope into his breast pocket, hugging slipped the identity disc between the photographs I was helping Corporal Pritchard shoveled the earth back over hawks body, listening with one ear to hug and sharing the dead man's ammunition and other possessions among the members of the company headquarters. When suddenly I became aware of Jimmy Gray standing beside me, apparently h just to speak, but diff diffident at interrupting, telling Pritchard to finish the job. I rose from my knees. Glad to be able to put my mind to something else. When I turned to speak to gray, I was disturbed by what I saw. The dirt of battle had exaggerated his usual scruffiness.

Speaker 2:          00:44:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:12       As smart controllers were coated with mud and dust and his right sleeve was stained from top to bottom with blood, not his own. As he explained when he saw my eyes fixed on it, the front of his smock and the battle dress under neath had been torn by a large fragment of a mortar bomb, which in some miraculous fashion had failed to even scratch him three inches to one side and it would have been set and it would have severed his head, but it was the eyes above the pallet on shaven cheeks, which were frightening.

Speaker 2:          00:44:47       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:44:48       They were empty of life when he spoke. The words are lucid and well chosen has ever, but the voice lacked expression. The phrases were cold. It was not as if you were describing events which he had himself witnessed, but something unreal, something half imagined. B Company at attacked at zero 800 hours at the start, they're advanced through the woods had gone like the first attack of the morning, a calm and steady progress against the seemingly nonexistent enemy. Then some hundred yards short of the objective, a swath the fire had cut down the men of the two leading platoons, the half grown trees and the sparse undergrowth had neater, neither hidden them nor shielded them from the interlocking arcs of the enemy weapons, which covered every inch of ground. It was just possible that they might have been able to deal with the machine guns alone, but the armor was too much for them. Pumping shells into the men at near point blank range gray had seen it all happen.

Speaker 2:          00:45:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:58       The colonel had tried to stop the attack as soon as the full strength of the enemy position had become clear, but by then more than half of the men of the two leading platoons had been killed or wounded. Both sub alternates were dead. The other officers and the CSM at all been wounded. The colonel had tried to turn the German flanked by sending a company around to the left, but there was no flank.

Speaker 2:          00:46:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:27       The second attack had been a replica of the first. It too had collapsed, but not before some 40 more men were dead or maimed, including two of the four surviving officers.

Speaker 2:          00:46:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:41       Harry Bates had been terribly wounded in the stomach and by now was probably dead. That's great at pulled him behind some cover his blood soaked to sleeve. This was not the complete story. There was further bad news. Not only had our own attack been shattered, but the other battalion to our north had hits similar enemy positions and was making little progress progress in its efforts to get into our Nemo along the main road from somewhere or other. The bullshit found enough troops of quality good enough to smash the brigades, attempt to reach the city, so we just have a horrible situation unfolding.

Speaker 2:          00:47:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:39       Back to the book from far away in the distance came the drum of powerful airplane engines. Nesbitt was the first to spot the minute shapes first circling and then diving out of the sun towards us. The noise changing to a shriek as the machine swept down towards the wood, towards the woods from a half a dozen different directions. Uh, happy shout of Spitfires rose from the trenches at lasts some help but arrived from the outside world. The RAF had arrived to give us close air support and that's, you know, we've had close air support save the day many times in, in, in books that we've talked about on this podcast. As I gaved up at the doesn't spit screaming down to strafe the Boesch positions on the sloping Ridge head. Nesbitt's voice suddenly roared in my year shouting to everyone to get their heads down and hide their faces as I duct with the rest. I spotted the black crosses on the wings. The aircraft were not ours, but German measure Schmitz. Our air superiority was so overwhelming that it never occurred to anyone that the machines might be hostile. They were not diving onto the enemy positions, but onto our own.

Speaker 1:          00:49:00       I gazed skywards the measure Schmidt was so close that I could see the pilots face. Two rockets detach themselves from the wings and swooped down to explode seconds later in the woods where the survivors of a and B companies, we're settling into their new positions. As I ducked once more, there was another scream of engines from behind followed by the sound of a storm of bullet striking branches on the trees and the other side two aircraft which had discharge their rockets. We're now carrying out a second run strafing with their machine guns. As I squeezed even closer to the earth at the bottom of this shallow trench, the reverberations of an explosion, some 50 yards ways pounded my year drums. It was another rocket. Suddenly it ended the aircraft advantaged as quickly as they had arrived. Wow. Yeah. Cause at this point the, the, the British and the Americans had almost total air domination and so everyone just completely assumed that, oh thank God here comes some spitfires to come and save us. And and they were wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:50:13       Now the the air, we did have air domination for the most part and one of the things that they needed as you, as you heard these airborne troops, they can only carry so much and so they're, they're going to need, they need more ammunitions. They need medical gear, they need food, they need water. They need stuff to be dropped to them, and so there was a plan in place for them to have gear and food and equipment and ammunition dropped to them at these locations where they were supposed to be, because remember they were supposed to be making progress this whole time. They're not making progress, but there are supposed to be making progress and since communication is so bad, they can't call back and say, hey, we're not. We're supposed to be, we're over here. Drop the gear on us. But the gear gets dropped in the pre planned positions, which of course our enemy positions, but here's what it sounds like for them, or here's what they're thinking on the ground. Then to the south of us, I saw the familiar shape of a line of Dakotas approaching at about a thousand feet in a minute. The Sky was crammed with them. It was the first supply drop about which we had been told that the briefings, but the drop zone was a couple miles away over the other side of the hill. Right in the middle of enemy positions.

Speaker 2:          00:51:34       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:35       By now, of course the division should have captured the area, but the Boesch still held it. News of the progress of the battle could not have reached the RAF or the pilots would have diverted a drop their supplies elsewhere. Now they can see this happening and the people that are in the plains, they're called the RASC, the Royal Army Service Corps. They run basically the supply and the logistics and, and help resupply and drop this equipment. So this is, he's as he's watching all these Dakota's the Dakotas are these little transport plans. It's actually what they had parachuted out of and now they're watching them drop this resupply back to the book among the mass. A Single Dakota just overhead caught my attention.

Speaker 2:          00:52:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:30       It had already been hit and flames were creeping down from the starboard engine toward the cockpit.

Speaker 2:          00:52:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:37       As it lost height, the khaki clad Ra. See, dispatchers were standing at the open doorway pushing out the penny, heirs of supplies. Those are the bags of supplies.

Speaker 2:          00:52:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:50       I could see their faces. The fire was on their side of the plane. The wing was burning before their eyes. The Dakota was now little more than 300 feet above the ground. If the men at the door jumped. Now they might just save themselves in a second or two more. The aircraft would be so low that their parachutes would not have time to open this. The men must have known, but they went on with their routine drill, pushing out the panty heirs regardless of what would happen to them. Then the starboard wing crumpled. The flaming plane disappeared behind the trees. The panty are still falling from the open door. The Sky was empty. The last plane had gone

Speaker 2:          00:53:45       cool,

Speaker 1:          00:53:45       but we still stood. Watching the place where the Dakota had vanished. Mourning the futility of the self sacrifice we had just witnessed.

Speaker 2:          00:54:00       Right.

Speaker 1:          00:54:00       Can't even imagine that guys just continuing to do their job knowing their fate

Speaker 2:          00:54:15       at

Speaker 1:          00:54:17       there. Their senior officers at this point, and they're in CEO's are, are starting to get hit pretty regular beach by snipers and so he decides to, he tells his his guys, Hey, take your take your rank off your uniform because I don't want the enemy to know. And he tells us to one of his, one of his leaders name named Robert and he says, I watched Robert's slip, his captain stars off his shoulders and tucked them away in his pocket. I knew for certain that my second in command disapproved officers should show themselves as such. So one of his guys is thinking, no, we're officers. We need to, we need to stand out. We need to stand up.

Speaker 2:          00:55:04       Now

Speaker 1:          00:55:05       I mentioned the American forces, the 82nd and the hundred and first and the British forces. There was also a Polish parachute brigade that was coming in on this attack as well and they were scheduled to come in a little bit later as reinforcements. And here we go back to the back whole book. Only then did I remember that the glider born part of the Polish parachute brigade was due to land that afternoon upon the stretch of enemy upon the stretch of open country below us. At the same time as the parachute battalions were dropped in the polder land south of our Nem bridges, the landing zone was already a battlefield and the wretched polls we're about to land in the middle of it. First the gliders hit the ground. It's massive weight tearing up chunks of stubble as it skidded to a halt lurching onto one wing.

Speaker 1:          00:55:57       As it did so, men jumped out and rushed to the rear end to release the tail unit so that the vehicles inside could be driven out to more gliders were not plowing across the ground. Another exploded in the air and a vast ball of yellow flame just as it was upon the point of touching down, mortar bombs were bursting among the men struggling to release their loads. While streams of chase tracer bisected the scene into oddly formal patterns, another glider was on fire on the ground as still more swooped in to land, adding to the chaos. The polls were now joining in the battle themselves, some firing toward the Germans, some towards the Kpos B, which is the king's own Scottish borders. It's a, it's another British unit and some in the direction of our other battalion. It must be impossible for the Poles to distinguish enemy from friend. They probably thought they had landed in a circle of Boesch units, all intent upon their destruction. In a few minutes, it was all over from the wrecked and flaming gliders, which now littered the ground. Small parties of Poles were making their escape firing at anything they saw move. Two or three vehicles had been driven away, but otherwise they'd failed the drag, their jeeps and guns from the gliders. The Polish anti tank battery no longer existed as a fighting unit. It had landed in the middle of a battle and been destroyed before it could fire a single shot waste. It was waste. Once again. Waste like the supply drop. Nothing seemed to go right.

Speaker 1:          00:57:32       Uh, not have some eight polls charged towards us. Intent on seeking shelter either in the woods or behind the safety of a railway embankment, some 30 yards away. One man slightly ahead of the others must have noticed our camouflage steel helmets in the slit trenches ahead and shouted a warning in a bunch. They flung themselves into the undergrowth anticipating what would happen. I yelled to everyone to get their heads down just as a hail of bullets from the Poles whistled over our heads, a few hitting the trench pair of pits, but most striking the trees well above our heads as the excited men empty their weapons in our direction. So long as we kept our heads down, we were safe from the Polish fire. But the worry was that some of them might creep closer and start to fling grenades around. However, in a couple of minutes, the firing slackened and then ceased possibly the polls sense that something might be wrong when no one retaliated. The comparative silence provided the opportunity to shout a warning across the narrow stretch of ground which separated us. There was no reply and I shouted once again and faltering English, a voice inquired who we were

Speaker 1:          00:58:40       firmly. The company sergeant major Huggins told them, the polls seem to understand. After a few seconds of audible consultation, they rose to their feet and walked across. So you've got to be just a chaotic situation. The polls land, they're getting attacked from all directions and sure enough, they're shooting at the friendly forces blue on blue happening once he gets them settled down, he's got some people, some of these Polish folks that now have no leadership. Back to the book, calling Douglas over. I told him that he now had a fourth section in seven platoon and within a few minutes the polls were digging hard under the tutelage of their corporal. The only comprehensible part of whose name sounded like Peter. The digging had hardly started. When a jeep roared down the track and the direction from the direction of the battalion headquarters as it breaked to stop and the cover of the trees, Jimmy get gray, jumped out and ran towards us. Gray's news was startling. We were all to withdraw to Wolf Hasan in 15 minutes time.

Speaker 1:          00:59:46       One could not just stand up and walk away from an enemy, right on one's heels in day light. The only way to withdraw was to move by bounds with platoons and companies covering one another back. Any other plan was madness. Things over in the north must be bad and deed for the colonel to be rushed in this way. But Grey's instructions were unshakeable. So they're digging in and are getting ordered. Get out of here, we're going to leave. And he saying, okay, that's fine, but guess what? Even when you leave and you still use the fundamental principle of cover and move. Yeah, and that's what he's wanting to do. So now they're on the retreat and here we go. Back to the book. The pace was far too quick. Some men were all but running to keep up. As I had expected, a little by little cohesion, we're starting to break down.

Speaker 1:          01:00:31       Some of the men of the mortar platoon had overtaken us despite the weight of the loads and we're mixed in among us. There were two small groups from another unit in the middle of seven platoon from somewhere in the front, a long way off. A Spandau spent sent, it's bullets flying harmlessly overhead, but men were looking apprehensive and flinching. We were now under fire from two different directions. At any minute. The Bush would find the range and then the slaughter would begin. It was no longer an orderly retreat. The withdrawal was taking on the nature of a hoard of men seeking safety. Soon discipline would crack and everyone would start to run. What a target. We must be some 500 men from four to five different units rapidly coalescing into a solid moving mass. Yeah. This is just a nightmare and you can imagine it's an individual thing and you're going to see some great leadership examples, but it's an individual thing because if you can keep the teams working together, covering and moving for each other, that's good.

Speaker 1:          01:01:34       You're going to keep the enemies heads down. But if w if people in the group starts saying, you know what, I'm not going to cover. I'm going to run. Yeah, and now no one's covering and now you've got a bunch of people that are moving and no cover and that's when you're going to get slaughtered. Not only going to get slaughtered by by people that are shooting at you, but if you're not putting down cover fire, the enemy maneuvers, they don't just sit there. I mean some of them we shooting, but there'll be shooting, but other elements of them are going to move and they're going to be able to cut you off.

Speaker 1:          01:02:04       They finally do make it back and they get it. They get a little bit of luck here. Here we go. Back to the book, we caught our breath in the wood so they, they get to a woods. David's men had disappeared and there was no sign of the kernel or of the battalion headquarters. No one had followed us. We the last across, but a quick check told me that only Robert Watson, the CSM and three or four other men were missing in addition to seven bill toone of the ladder. There was nothing to be seen in all. There were still about 50 men with me. Not Counting Peter and his seven poles still clinging tenaciously to us. Perhaps I should try to get back across the bullet spattered embankment to find out what had happened to the others. But the noise of the battle was getting louder. The Boesch must be closing in the vital thing must be to rejoin the rest of the battalion with the 50 men I still had and not to leave them in loop. Tyler's charge while I returned on what could be a foolhardy errand,

Speaker 1:          01:03:02       but it was difficult to avoid the thought that perhaps I was reluctant, reluctant to climb back over the top of that embankment. So he, he does make it to this woods, but he didn't have everybody with him and he's questioning himself, should I go back over there and risk it or not? And part of is part of his rationalizing, you know, I, the best thing to do is get back with the rest of the Italian. But part of him is saying, you're rationalizing this and you're just, you're just not, you're, you're being a coward. But he does. He, he proceeds on with Italian. He knows he's going to get killed. If he goes over that, he can hear the enemy coming. So back to the book, 10 minutes later, we found the remnants of the battalion, half of a company, the mortars and what was left of the machine guns were still were missing as well as our own seven platoon. More than one third of the men who had withdrawn from the woods had failed across the railway. We were now down to no more than a couple of hundred men.

Speaker 2:          01:04:02       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:04:03       so we're going, we're down to a couple of hundred men from five or 600 men in the battalion, maybe even a little bit more, maybe there might have been 700 men in the battalion. They get word once again. Here's what's going to happen tomorrow at first light, the brigade would move on to booster beak to join the rest of the division, but unless ammunition together with air and artillery support was forthcoming, the prospects were far from good. We were, it seemed not opposed by a few third line troops. Elements of three SS Panzer divisions had been identified in the battle. The Germans seemed to have moved quickly or else something had gone wrong with the intelligence. It was not surprising that the days fighting had been so very bitter, so they're pointing out that they weren't going against, you know, third rate troops. They were going up against ss Panzer divisions, the best of the German soldiers. In talking with sergeant major bower and Sergeant Nesbitt, before I reached Tyler's platoon, I had done my best to be as cheerful as possible, but it was plain that the two [inaudible] realized that I was making the best of things. With Luke Tyler. It was different. I could not insult him by trying to disguise our straights.

Speaker 1:          01:05:28       I just told them the facts as I had received them from the kernel. Possibly it was a mistake. Quite suddenly, the failure of it all oppressed me. In less than 36 hours, two thirds of the battalion had gone, 15 rifle company officers had landed. Only two were left. 10 for certain had either been killed or wounded. The chances of surviving another day. We're small fatigue and a hunger. It drained me. There was a need to unburden myself. Luke was junior in my rank, but equal in years. And in any case, it was easier to confide in someone who was, in many ways a stranger. Even as I spoke, I was ashamed of this weakness, but there was no stopping quietly. Luke gave me the reassurance I needed the iron needed to sustain oneself through such a day was easily expended. And I felt that I had purloined some of Luke share. So he, he basically on loads to one of his guys or to want to another, uh, another officer below him in rank. But what I think is interesting about this is

Speaker 1:          01:06:46       he needed someone to talk to. He knew he was holding it all inside and wasn't saying anything and trying to look positive. And even he's looking at his guys as he's telling them, don't worry gents, we're going to be okay. And his guys are looking at him like, Hey, no, we don't believe you. And so he has to, he feels the need to unload on someone. And that's why, you know, I just think from my perspective, you know, we always talk about relationships that you have on your team and for sure in your platoon or in your team, it's really good to have someone that you can just kind of unload on that, you know, is professional enough to bolster you up without getting dragged down into your negativity. And a lot of times I've found if, if you have someone like that, or maybe a couple people like that and your team that you can talk to, well guess what?

Speaker 1:          01:07:30       Sometimes they're going to be bolstering your attitude and sometimes you're going to be bolstering their attitude. And so you gotta, you gotta find someone like that that's in your team that you can say, man, this is, this is horrible, this is going wrong. And that someone's going to go, hey, you know what? It's not that bad. We're going to get through it. And then through, or three days later, he might become to you and saying, Hey, this is a horrible situation that I can't believe this. And you're going to say, no man, we're going to be all right. So I think it's important and that's again, we're building relationships, but that's one of the reasons we build relationships. They get into a holdup position. Back to the book on stand two rounds, I found the Polish trenches empty except for Peter there. Corporal crouched grimly behind his brand, the rest of the party advantaged in the early hours sensing perhaps a day at attach themselves to an unlucky unit. Peter explained nothing but as embarrassment. It was clear it was both unfair and pointless to press him for details when either pride or sense of duty had kept him there to fight among strangers. The fault of what would have happened if the enemy at attack from this direction against the position held by one solitary man was chilling.

Speaker 1:          01:08:42       It was a mistake to trust strangers I had learned yet another lesson. Rely on only those you knew.

Speaker 1:          01:08:54       Again, it's interesting how he sometimes backs off. Instead of pressing w, where are your guys? He knows, he's like, what? What point is that? Or when Bartholomew was, was running away, he didn't press him super hard and you're going to get to a point, there's pointing to here when he does press people, but here he's decided he's not going to do it. And the other interesting thing is here it says, I learned another lesson rely, you know, not distrust strangers relying on only those, you know what you have to do in those situations is you have to put someone that you do trust in bed them with these units that you don't know. So if you would have taken, and he gave these, he gave that section to one of his platoon commanders and said, hey, you got another section now, but maybe in bed one more guy or two more guys in there or split these guys up even more. So instead of seven and one big bulk, you put two or three there, two or three, there are two or three there and now you split them up a little bit and you can have better control over them. Yeah, it's weird. There's, you know, there's opportunity to dessert though. And these guys took the opportunity. Sure.

Speaker 1:          01:09:56       Now the fighting rages on and obviously I have to fast forward through some of it and they eventually get into of little village, a little small village and they've, they've taken down, they've taken some buildings and here we go there in these buildings back to the book, we were in a mess. The Boesch were on the other side of the valley, outnumbered and outgunned us.

Speaker 2:          01:10:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:10:26       There was not the slightest hope of reaching the back of the breed line this way and to stay here on this Ford slope was impossible at this rate, we would all be dead or wounded soon.

Speaker 2:          01:10:39       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:10:40       Somehow I had to get the survivors back up the hill, but it was near, but it was a near in Superbowl problem with the men scattered down among the houses, lawns and shrubberies shot at every time they moved. Someone called from the side of the house. As I turned and looked private, Gregory darted across to throw himself down beside me under the dirt and two days scrub of beard. His face was grayish white. He seemed about to vomit as Gregory stammered out his platoon commanders. I knew what had happened. Lieutenant Tyler was dead. It must have happened just after we parted. Luke had been killed on the steep garden path, which led from the house down the road. He'd, he'd been hit by a sniper, killed outright by a bullet through the heart. We did a couple of yards of the place where Gregory was lying.

Speaker 1:          01:11:35       Possibly Luke had been careless because he was still dazed, but he had to get back to his platoon and the path was his only route. So they had been together and they'd been hit by a some kind of artillery in the house and it rattled them. And then Luke had gone out to get back back to his platoon and when he left, he got shot by a sniper back to the book. This was how officers and ntls were killed just doing their routine job. This was why casualties among the leaders were so high all the time that they were moving about checking here, encouraging their backwards and forwards. Now besides myself and only the quartermaster, sergeant bower and Sergeant Weiner were left, all the rest of the officers and sergeants and the company had gone.

Speaker 1:          01:12:26       One problem, however, had been solved the remnants of Tyler's to forward sections had mannered, managed to extricate themselves without waiting for orders. Since last night, private Gregory had been in charge of one of the other sections, both the ncls having been hit the day before during that last mortar stock, a bomb and fallen right on top of the corporal who's commanding the other section, blowing him and his brand gunner half to pieces. Commonsense had told us survivors to quit and there had been no one to stop them except Gregory, who for the moment was shaken by the sight of what had happened to his friends and who in any case lack the authority to hold them there. No one else had been hit and scrambled back and the survivors were now sheltering in the house.

Speaker 2:          01:13:20       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:13:22       so they're in these houses and, and for the first time you're going to hear the company commander start to realize he's got people at the breaking point. Back to the book. The others were as uneasy as I was for the first time. I was unhappy about them until now. They'd endured the success of disasters, but the events of the morning had tried them too far. It had been yesterday, once again, yet another failure, failure against an enemy who is far too strong for us. Men we're looking jittery. Some could be well near their breaking point. As I gazed down the slope, trying to spot some activity among the Bush, a movement to the right caught my eye about 20 yards away. Two of Kelly's men were moving diagonally behind me, sheltered the far side of the ridge.

Speaker 2:          01:14:13       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:14:14       these are, these are desert, hers. My shout made them hesitate and then stop after two or three more steps for getting the enemy, I stood up and strode down towards them. No explanation was necessary. The surly guilt on their faces was enough. Deliberately choosing words for effect. I cursed them in language, rarely used by officers towards their soldiers.

Speaker 2:          01:14:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:14:40       It was enough. The two men turned back towards their platoon.

Speaker 2:          01:14:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:14:48       So like I said, sometimes he or if they're there, he's dropping the hammer. These two guys are trying to dessert and he goes on and drops the hammer on them and gets them back with their platoon. Back to the book. In this mood, the men would never stand up to an enemy attack. Even a mortar stock could break them. I could see it happening. First one or two men would slip away like the two I had just stopped and then a rush would follow. Something drastic had to be done. No more than the occasional rifle bullet was now coming over. In fact, no one had been hit since we took our positions along this rich, it seems safe enough standing up. I began to walk along the path towards the left of our position. For the first few steps. I felt wretchedly vulnerable, but then an odd exoration seized me for the first few steps. I felt wretchedly vulnerable, but then an odd exhilaration seized me not too slowly and not too quickly. I strode deliberately toward the first group of men grinning down at Lance Corporal Williams. I made some inept remark about it being the wrong place for a company. Clark,

Speaker 1:          01:16:04       if I were to be hit, it would happen anyway. Now seem to be as good a time as ever stopping at each group of men. I checked their firing positions and made necessary changes that I was at the end of Kelly's line and I started back conscious that everyone was watching. There was a burst of machine gun fire, well wide of us, but I managed to avoid flinching at it. Suddenly, sergeant we whiners voice harsh with concern, was yelling at me to get down demanding angrily what I was playing at the spell broke. I was grateful for the excuse to lower myself down beside him, very relieved that it was over the rage and winders face dissolved into an on a custom grin. The corny dramatics were over, but they had served their purpose. The men had got a grip on themselves. So he basically stood up and walked around and talked to everyone and made himself visible and made himself appear to not be scared to get the guys heads back in the day until his sergeant winder yells at him and says, hey dude, get down when these guys, these are like the desert is, where did they go so they can head back towards, towards the areas that had been secured.

Speaker 1:          01:17:23       So as this beach edge, you know, we landed d day, June 6th this is now in September. So you know, coalition forces or or sorry, allied forces had pushed into France. So if you could walk back, you could eventually get too friendly lines. Yeah. And that's, that's what their plan was. And then what that when you get there, don't they know, hey you do 30 days, you'd say, all right. You know, you'd say, Oh, I was, I got separated from my chops when I parachuted in. I couldn't find my people or whatever. You make up your lie and you deal with it later with it later because right now you're thinking I'm not going to make it

Speaker 2:          01:17:58       the crazy,

Speaker 1:          01:18:01       it was clear why nothing. We had heard nothing from battalion headquarters for the past two hours. Like everyone else, the signal, the signalers orderlies and clerks had been fighting for their own survival. The Germans were all around them and had been pressing them hard throughout the morning so they're not getting any information about what's happening.

Speaker 1:          01:18:21       This is, this is interesting. He goes back to get they, they ended up with a little extra ammunition and he goes back to get some ammunition from the battalion. They haven't got it like stage in the battalion headquarters and and how's he's doing this? He is, the ammunition was in a jeep and so he goes to the jeep, he finds the jeep and he's with one of his other guys and they're the regimental sergeant major is sitting basically on top of the jeep on top of the ammunition and he kind of is looking at the guy, you know, saying, Hey, I'm here. I'm an all star. I got paltunes out there and a company out there, I got to get them ammunition and he doesn't really move. He just kind of sits there. Hmm. And so finally, uh, here he was here, the regimental Sergeant Major was in the middle of battle sitting on his arse and taking his ease while a company commander hunted for ammunition majors are not in the habit of rebuking regimental sergeant majors, but this was too much. The tensions of the morning. It's snapped myself for spray restraint. And in a couple of succinct sentences, I told the RS, the regimental sergeant major what I thought of him.

Speaker 2:          01:19:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:19:32       Then the row, the regimental sergeant major apologized, but he did not move without any trace of irony or annoyance in his voice. He quietly explained that he could not stand up because he had been shot through both legs. I had not noticed the airborne smock with which someone had covered his outstretched and bandaged legs.

Speaker 2:          01:19:57       Thanks. I think

Speaker 1:          01:19:57       before you act now they're on their way. They're heading finally to this area of Ooh, stir beak there on their patrol. And here we go. Back to the book of Spandau opening up ahead, sent us all to the ground. Men diving for cover just a little too quickly on a moment later, a second gun fired on us from the right, but it was the, it was the ominous rattle of the tracked vehicles, which chilled the first one than another. Then two more quite close and in front. Their engine clatter rising above the din of the machine, guns and rifles. Then some 70 yards away. I saw the first of the SP guns. It's stubby weapon traversing slowly towards us. Sp guns are there. They're kind of like tanks. It's, it's self propelled guns. They're like artillery pieces with tracks on them.

Speaker 1:          01:20:52       The flash from its stout from it's now, it was one of, with the explosion of the bursting shell, just to the right, a half grown tree shattered in a jagged splinters, a second shot following hard on the first one covered Harrison and me with earth. We were swamped by the noise. Every sort of weapons seemed to be firing. Grenades were exploding, but the distinct above the rest was the clank and the throaty cough of the armored guns caught like this and the open. We were helpless tanks plowing among about among us could have been no worse. There was no way of fighting back. No one does seem to have even a PR which is like their Bazooka anti armor weapon and we could not get close enough to use the gammon bombs. The bags of plastic explosive carried for the for use against armor, so that's another little, it's like a big bag of explosives that you can put on a, on a armored vehicle to destroy it. They call them gammon bombs. The men in front, we're moving again. I stood up and signaled those behind to follow. We were doubling now, but there was still some sort of control. We were not running away but making for somewhere where I did not know.

Speaker 1:          01:22:07       Then about a hundred yards away, I caught a glimpse through the trees have a German half track. It stopped and helmeted shapes jump from its sides. How many more of them were there? This could be the start of another attack, which could only end it all our will to fight back was all but broken. Then I heard the Brig, the brigadier telling me to clear the enemy out of the hollow after which the survivors of the brigade would join us there c company, it seemed was the last organized body of troops, so they're looking at this area, this open area where there's some enemy, but it looks like it's a good position. Of course, their will to fight is just about broken and you hear the brigadier is saying, Hey, take your company and clear out that hollow. Go back to the book for a moment. I was so dumbfounded that I hardly heard the brigadier going on to say that the brigade major was dead as well.

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       Killed about five minutes ago. Another friend was gone, but I hardly listened. What was the brigadier ordering us to do and his quiet and determined fashion. It was absurd. The men were finished. Only a few minutes ago, I had realized that they were passed defending themselves. Now we were being told to assault that Boesch position. The brigadiers look was both quizzical and encouraging. The confounded man could see what was passing through my mind. Then I was away dodging back and through the bushes towards the men in the ditch. Even more aware than ever before of the bullets singing overhead with my back to a broad tree which hit me from the enemy front. I looked down at the upturn faces. There was no point in wasting at all in wasting time on details. The orders I had to give them more, quite simple, devoid of any complications such as who would provide covering fire. It was time for play, acting again, my naturally loud voice carrying down the line of men and Bung above the sound of battles. I balled them to follow me. Adding the comment that is better to be killed going for the basters than lying in that bloody ditch.

Speaker 1:          01:24:21       No one has a stated. The men rose to their feet. At the moment, I stepped out into the open from behind the shelter of the tree. Glancing to my right. I was exhilarated by the sight of David Unwin. Solid bulk running parallel to me and half a dozen of his men following David shouted something to the effect that they were coming as well. And I waved my sten gone and acknowledgement behind me. Sergeant Winder broke into a scream of rage, harsh and furious. The yell spread down the line too heavily laden and too tired to sprint. We lumbered forward towards the enemy and a sort of jog trot. Now, I was careless of everything. We did not stand a chance, but this was the right way to go.

Speaker 1:          01:25:10       This was the proper way to finish it all. Nearly hysterical. Now with rage and excitement, I heard my own voice join in the screaming. The Germans were shooting at us. I could see flashes of their weapons springing out of the gloom of the trees. There was no need to look back to confirm that the line of men was still following the noise told me they were there. Now the boats were no more than 50 yards away. As I brought my sten down to hip level, depress the trigger. They flashed through my mind that it was the first time I had fired my weapon. Since the battle started my four fingers squeeze the metal, nothing happened. It had jammed. Here I was running toward the enemy with a useless piece of metal in my hands.

Speaker 2:          01:25:53       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:25:54       There were figures moving among the trees. First, a couple than a half dozen dark shapes were outlined against the green background. Men sprinting away, men disappearing through the trees. The boats were running away. We had done it. We had driven the enemy out at the point of bay and that this was the ultimate in war. The site of the savage screaming parachute is streaming towards them, had been too much for the Germans, even though they had to do nothing more than keep their heads and shoot straight. Yeah. So there you go. Surrounded, broken. And I think the key point here,

Speaker 2:          01:26:39       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:26:40       When you're think you're broken, do something and do something aggressive. Yeah. That's, that's The d. This is, this is a hundred percent default aggressive. That's what this is. You know what? We're here. We're being defensive. We're hiding in our slit trenches. Okay. You know what we're going to do? We're going to attack. We're going to attack full force. Yeah. Back to the book. The sight of David on the right added to my delight, shouting to him to hold the right of the hollow. I directed Sergeant Weiner round to the left. There was no need to tell anyone to hurry. They all knew that the Germans would not delay in mounting a counter attack. Umone of terror distracted me. I turned to the wounded German. The man's features were contorted into a rictus of despair. Above him stood sergeant major Kelly red eyed and panting his band that raised above the soldiers stomach, but Kelly did not strike. He was relishing the moment snatching maximum pleasure from the wounded man's anguish before he sliced it sliced into the soft belly. As my newly found mouser knocked the bayonet to one side, the sergeant major smelled at me in an unspoken protest at such silly scruples.

Speaker 1:          01:27:55       Then he seemed to shake himself. The blood lust has bad past did. He came to his senses, gathering his men to the defenses. So again, he could, this guy goes from the pure fury and rage of this incredible bayonet, all salt, and then he immediately just puts his one of his sergeant majors in check who's about to, you know, rent ruthlessly killed this wounded guy. Very interesting dichotomy there.

Speaker 2:          01:28:24       Mm hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:28:28       Back to the book. Something had been snatched back from the disasters of the day. The remnants of the brigade headquarters together with a few stragglers from other units had now all arrived in all, there seemed to be about 150 men with a half a dozen officers as well as the Brigadier David and myself. There was Jimmy Gray. The latter brought news that the colonel was probably dead, although he could not be sure as they'd become separated during a scrimmage with an sp gun of the rest of the officers who had jumped with a battalion captain John Simmons. The gunner forward observer was the only left one left.

Speaker 2:          01:29:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:29:12       Continuing. After about 15 minutes, a lowland shooting suggested that I might now be able to get round to visit the battalion positions. The battalion for the first time, it struck me that I was now in command of what was left of it, pitiful remnants, but they are still fighting. The brigadier had allotted the south and west sides of the perimeter to us. The first pit held sergeant wiener with seven or eight men at the bottom. His eyes shut, lay a gray faced and motionless private Gregory shot through his stomach.

Speaker 2:          01:29:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:29:48       Corporal Pritchard had bandaged him up and give them a shot of Morphia, but because his airborne smock had been pulled down over his blood stain dressing to keep as warm as possible, he laid there with no outward sign of injury looking as a man might do who had collapsed with exhaustion. Gregory's eyes opened when he saw who was standing over him. He asked for the favor. His voice was quiet. His words measured in coherent. His proposal quite logical out here. Without the help of a doctor, he was going to die in any case and he could stand the pain no longer which someone please put a bullet through his head. For the moment my grip tightened on the Mauser and Gregory State, I probably would have been asking for the same release. If it did happen, I hope that someone would have the guts to give it to me. Then I caught whiners. I then he knew that I could not do it.

Speaker 1:          01:30:52       The only way to help Gregory was to give him a further shot of more for Ya. Dangerous though it would be to do so. As I reached for my own ampule in the breast pocket of my smock, I was ashamed by my reluctance. The reason it was purely selfish, sooner or later I might want to use it on myself. Wounded and alone behind a bush with no one about to help me. But Sergeant Wiener came to the rescue. He had scrounged a couple of supply of ampules from somewhere or another opening the small black tin. He Bared Gregory's arm and pressed the needle home. The words of sympathy and encouragement sounded pitifully trite as I pressed Gregory's shoulder, nervous of any reproach, which I might see. I turned and walked away without looking at the wound and man's face. My name was being called. It was private Jones slithering towards me down the opposite slope of the hollow. Jones told me quickly, I was major Unwin killed by a sniper shot through the forehead as he, he's peering over the rim of the hollow, trying to locate the whereabouts of a span dough machine gun. He died instantly. Jones was adamant. There was no doubt that he was dead. His brains had been blown out. Jones was urging me to come see his body, but I could not bring myself to do so.

Speaker 1:          01:32:36       David could not be dead. They could not have killed David. Everyone else, yes, one after another, friends had died, but I never believed that this could happen in David. So vast, so indestructable the humerus, gentle David. The brigadier was beside me. He had also heard the news for nearly two years. He had known us both and it was playing that he understood the anguish, but there were other things to think about

Speaker 1:          01:33:14       as we knew only too well. The brigadier told us our ammunition. It was nearly finished and as her own fire slackened the enemy, snipers were becoming bolder and more men were being hit. Soon we would be forced to surrender, so we had decided to take the initiative. We would break out towards the rooster beak, charging through the enemy and solid mass, trusting our numbers and impetus to get through. It was an extraordinary plan for the second time that day the brigadier was ordering us to do what seemed impossible, but our trust and the brigadier, his judgment was now implicit. It was a gamble, but one which offered at least a chance of success to stay here would only one end one way.

Speaker 1:          01:34:03       15 minutes later we were ready. It could have been the start of a race. The brigadier asked whether we were ready, then add his shout. The hundred of us rose to our feet and exploded in a solid mass over the lip of a hollow in front was the brigadier himself leading the way behind came the yelling, screaming men filthy and bloodstained weapons in their hands, band nets, dull and menacing. A fearful site to anyone in our path. The German fire now seem to be coming from every direction, but I saw no one hit. We were rushing downhill along us lane, a solid human battering ram. The first wild play pay slackened the firing stopped. We had done it. We were through the enemy and out of the forest for the second time, that day boldness to it saved us once again, some default aggressive activity. And, and I mean obviously I want to make it clear that emboldened the both these situations, it wasn't, it wasn't, uh, it wasn't a call of, hey, there's a, there's a, there's a objective we want to reach. Charge it.

Speaker 2:          01:35:26       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:35:27       It was, we can either sit here and do nothing and die or we can attack. That's the, that's the big, I don't want anyone out there thinking, okay, I'm just going to, every time default aggressive, I'm going to run and we're going to attack. No. These are situations where the alternative to attacking is is being defensive, laying down and dying and continue to get picked off and snipers until you get overrun. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:35:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:35:52       Now they meet up with, finally they meet up with these other British troops. Back to the book. Someone was leading us into a garden of a large house. The men dropped to the ground as they halted, conscious that they were now safe with houses and other British Air British troops around them. Others after a swig from a water bottle, lay supine, unconscious. In instance, sleep. I counted them. Jimmy Gray, John Simmons and sergeant wine or were there sergeant major Kelly was missing. Someone had seen him fall in the rush. There were just 49 other men about half from c company last night there had been 200 the night before, 500 now they're in these positions and they're about to get attacked just below in the garden, but out of sight. Another brand opened up. It was Jimmy Gray Century at the garden gate. There was a glimpse of a camouflage figure running through the trees opposite no more than a hundred yards away, diagonally across our front towards the air landing troops. Then a couple more, Jimmy's Bren fired again and one of the figures pitched forward rolling over, carried on by its own momentum.

Speaker 1:          01:37:14       We would not, we would have to fight and this is their, they're talking, he's talking about the fact that they're in the houses now in these, in this village, we would have to fight from the house itself, not from the trenches in the garden. It was a sturdy building with thick solid walls. In any case, the garden was too small for the purpose from these upper windows. We would have an extra range and observation to fire diagonally down the road in front of the houses held by units to the left and right. 15 minutes later, the Trim Dutch house had been wrecked. Every pane of glass had been smashed and every picture and mirror knocked from the walls. There was no time to be careful in the center of each room. Barricades been built well back from the windows out of sight of the boat, but cited so that every scrap of ground outside was covered.

Speaker 1:          01:38:02       Sideboards and chest of drawers stuffed with books or bedding made the barricades contents of the furniture flung in heaps into corners of the rooms. Mattresses were rolled down to the basement, ready for use if needed by wounded men. More books crammed into drawers were blocking those windows not required for shooting through. Fortunately, the owner of the House possessed to find library from its content seemed a lose. A doctor with gray. I walked around the house for a final check before leaving to return to my own headquarters at the rear. Manic vandals might've swept through it. Some woman's life work ruined in the time it took to drink a cup of coffee. An explosion from above followed by the clatter of tiles falling from the roof, drowned out the noise from the gun. Another bomb burst in the garden just outside the window, sending a couple of fragments whistling into the room. Now the Bush were hitting us with mortars as well.

Speaker 1:          01:39:05       A bullet splintered of the empty frame behind me and buried itself in the ceiling. A warning that I was far too close to the back bedroom window. There was a sniper behind us as well as the Spandau. A quick movement in the garden of the house caught my eye. Then two figures in the wrong sort of camouflage darted from behind a Bush and did the shelter of a wall. They were Boesch, not British, so now the enemy was indeed all around us. There was no doubt about it. Now John Simmons and his men were in the houses where they had been left that morning. John had made strong points out of a couple of houses, smaller but just as robust as the ones held by gray. The two groups had been working closely together. Largely I felt certain because of John's charm of manner and determination, this young Gunnar had done very well. It hardly seems possible that most of his men hardly knew him by sight. Yesterday. Today he is welded. The survivors of four different companies have a unit into have another arm into a tight knit entity, well capable of carrying on the fight all day. They'd held from killing and wounding quite a lot of enemy but losing only one man themselves. A corporal have a company whose hand had been blown in half by a flying mortar, splinter

Speaker 1:          01:40:25       lined and filthy. Though his face was eyes, red rimmed and Chin stained with three days worth of fare, fuzzy down. John still moved briskly. Our reminder to all of us that we could still keep going. So he's got guys that are stepping up big time.

Speaker 2:          01:40:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:40:45       Inside the houses we felt reasonably safe from the shells and bullets, but there was always some cause for the officers and senior NCO is to move about in the open from building to another. It was the same as it had been in the woods, the officers and sergeants, so this trade or greater chance of being killed or wounded as their men, all the same. It was easier for an officer with so much to do. He had little time to worry about his own safety also. He always had to try and act the part to set an example to the others and officer had to exude confidence, however hard it might be, but because he always had to try to keep a grip on himself, it helped him forget the danger. Very true. Very true. Got a lot of things on your mind.

Speaker 1:          01:41:36       They get a massive bombardment in these positions that they're in. Back to the book of the Germans must be softening us up in preparation for something more serious. Their ammunition seemed unlimited. The bombardment ended quite suddenly rather as it had started. This would be it nudging Williams to get his head up from behind the barricade. I shouted a warning to the others, Elkins and Bauer in the next room and the two signalers who had moved up to the bedroom at the back. The starter of the Bren gun caught across the war, the words Bauer's rifle fudded next door, and then Williams was firing a succession of bursts from his Bren gun in the orchard opposite. Germans were running through the trees towards us. Several dropped. This could only be the start of an attack now from either flank, the sound of rifles and machine guns reached us accompanied by the thought of exploding grenades.

Speaker 1:          01:42:30       The attack was coming in all along our front. Some of the Germans among the fruit trees were firing back a couple of rifle bullets, splintered the front of the wardrobe. Then more gray figures. We're lumbering towards us through the trees. Some fell all there's ducked behind the puny trees. They didn't stand a chance. It was like shooting targets on the press practice range. The Germans and the mortars had been forced to stop because their troops were so close. It was so, it was, it was possible to fire slow, carefully aimed shots with little or no distraction. The only way out of the orchard was through the single gap in the high fence, but the enemy soldiers never got within 20 yards of it. A Tall German officer was standing in the middle of the drive out in the open, clear of the trees, waving his arms to the men behind him. No more than 50 yards away. Every detail of his face and uniform was clearly visible. He was a handsome young man, fair haired, and smartly turned out already. He'd been standing there for about five seconds encouraging his men to advance. As I leveled my sights on the German officer, I knew that I was at someone who is just about to die.

Speaker 1:          01:43:54       It seemed a pity. He was such a courageous boy, just the sort, just the sort one would like to have had as a platoon commander. My fingers started to squeeze the trigger, but it was too late. Someone else had fired. The German fell, spread eagled and lay still. At least he died quickly. The death of the young officer mark the end of the attack. Now, no one moved in the orchard except for a single wounded man squirming his way back through the trees. So it's interesting when you, you take the leader and the leader goes down and the attacks over. Hmm. Now, uh, also it's important to note that although the leader stood up and encouraged the attack by taking that risk of being out there in front of everyone, in this case, it didn't work out well because he got shot, killed and the attack faltered. Perhaps if he could have found a little bit better of a position to do that from then, then maybe then maybe he would have been able to encourage his troops and stay alive.

Speaker 2:          01:45:08       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:45:12       Back to the book. But we had one no more than a temporary respites 15 minutes later we could hear the unnerving noise once again, tracks were clattering towards us. So I haven't, I don't know why I haven't talked about this yet, but here you have these airborne troops on the ground and their biggest fear is tanks. And you've heard me talk many times about my love for tanks and how effective and awesome they are as tools and as a weapons and the way that the tankers utilize them. They're just, they're just awesome machines. But here you have the tables turned and and the good guys don't have real, any effective way of stopping these tanks. You can shoot a machine gun all day long at a, at a panzer tank and it's not going to do a damn thing. And so it can just, and by the way, you hide in the building, cool a tank. We'll go right through a building. They go right through buildings. They will go right through a building like it looks like a construction piece of heavy equipment. That's what it looks like. It'll go right through a building like it's nothing. So these guys are absolutely horrified of the tank showing up. That's their fear.

Speaker 1:          01:46:35       Tram tracks were clattering toward us, a gun funded and the dark red house opposite began to fall apart as round after round crashed into it. Muzzle flashes from the far side of the orchard revealed the position of the, but there was nothing we could do. At least the men. We're not waiting in the house but slipping one after another out the door, back across the road to the headquarter house on either side. The guns were firing. Now it was our turn,

Speaker 2:          01:47:10       the the

Speaker 1:          01:47:12       tank rex, some of the houses and then it the tank leaves. So here we go. It's, it was time to strike back. The tanks had gone and as yet the Bose did not appear to have occupied the houses lying out there in the rear gardens overlooked from the windows. We were vulnerable indeed. Soon the mortaring would start again, then we'd be safe for back in the ruined buildings. As John Simmons listened to the instructions, the young captains manor was as relaxed as ever, calm and outwardly self confident. He somehow managed to give the impression that he was almost enjoying the morning's work. Possibly he was making that a point subconsciously perhaps that are gunner could always take charge of 30 infantry men, but there were undoubtedly immense rose reserves of strength hidden behind that cool exterior. As he lay behind the bed of half dead pea plants scanning the houses for any sign of German occupants. There was no trace of disquiet and his voice as he discussed his orders to counter attack and clear the street to the enemy. 15 minutes after John had gone, I was still in the same place in the vegetable patch watching the second hand on my watch creep towards the top of the dial.

Speaker 1:          01:48:30       Then graze weapon opened up on the right, firing back in the back into the rooms of the houses, more in the hope of distracting the enemy. Then providing covering fire. The danger to John's men lay on the other side, the front of the houses. Now John's three brand guns were firing as well on the left. The assault party would soon be moving into the street.

Speaker 2:          01:48:57       It came

Speaker 1:          01:48:59       the sustained rattle of a Spandau Gun, first one, then a second.

Speaker 2:          01:49:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:49:06       After that there was silence except for one or two rifle shots. I waited lying in the vegetable patch, almost a straw with worry. Something was badly wrong. Nothing could be seen from here, but I had to resist the temptation of going to find out for myself what had happened. I must avoid getting involved in the skirmish. Then Corporal Day, now John's second in command was running through the flower beds toward me. Days. Face said everything even before he started to speak.

Speaker 2:          01:49:42       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:49:42       The attack had failed. It had failed the moment John had been killed out there in the middle of the street and 10 yards in front of day and the rest of the assault party, John had died in just the same way as that young German officer this morning that had finished it. The rest of them, including day had turned and run, but in some extraordinary way. No one else had been hit day made no excuse, no attempt to excuse himself, telling the story factually and not trying to put a gloss on the incident. The implication was clear. They had been asked to do too much. So now I had been responsible for killing John as well.

Speaker 2:          01:50:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:50:34       It had been so simple. I issued the orders and then John had walked out into the middle of that road to be shot down by the machine gun. I should not have done it right. The counter attack should never have been attempted. The men were no longer capable of making such an effort. They could still hang onto their positions fighting from behind cover, but after six days of continuous battle, they lack the will to get to their feet and go for the enemy in the woods. It had just been possible to urge them forward in one last surge of willpower, but since then they didn't dirt or a further 48 hours of death, starvation, thirst, and fatigue, and in the woods, it was men from my own company. Today, it had been different. Today, a mixture of men, survivors of four different companies had been left to follow a gunner officer whom they hardly knew. There was a limit to what soldiers could be asked to do and I had gone beyond those limits and so John Simmons had died.

Speaker 2:          01:51:54       Okay. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:52:03       That's the burden of command.

Speaker 2:          01:52:09       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:52:10       Back to the book, it was impossible to understand why the Germans were not using their arm or to support this infiltration by their infantry if they had done so, all resistance would have collapsed long ago and the tanks would have been on the lawns.

Speaker 2:          01:52:26       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:52:27       The crushing news at the brigadier had been badly wounded, came through on the telephone just before the line went dead. Once again, the Boesch, we're now among the houses and gardens, which the glider pilots had been holding and gray had reported that he was being shot at from two sides at the same time. The quarter master had also sent word that the enemy were behind him and that he had long ago lost all contact with the recky on his left.

Speaker 2:          01:53:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:53:04       They are just in a wretched state and he goes to meet with the colonel in one of the buildings. The colonel seemed to be trying to break something to, to us gently and then it came out. It was hard to believe, harder still to understand the division was to be withdrawn over the Rhine that night. It was all over. It had been, it had only been possible to ferry about 250 men of the door sits over the river before dawn, a profit lists addition to the perimeter garrison, the second army had overreached itself and trying to get to us and although the troops were pouring northward, they lack the strength across the river and continued the advance into Germany already the bush, we're hammering from the flanks at their narrow lines of communication, so the operation had failed. Everything had been in vain. It was all a waste. Listening to the outline of what had to be done that night, it was hard to concentrate on the details.

Speaker 2:          01:54:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:54:16       The first emotion was grief and then other disappointment. The battalion had been destroyed to no purpose

Speaker 1:          01:54:34       and that's it. They get the order that night to leave and they come up with a plan. They actually follow rope. They put rope at night down towards the river where they're going to get extracted and at night they attempt to follow that rope down there. And of course along the way they lose more men. Men Get separated, men don't hang on, they get lost and they lose even more men as they're trying to make it to their extraction point. But he does get end up with a small group of people at this extraction point. There's Canadian boats there to bring them across the Rhine River. Back to the book, the Canadians were already pulling the last men into the boat and I was standing with Harrison alone in the river when I heard the whiners voice harshly insisting that no one would be left behind the young Cox and needed no further urging button poured us to be careful as the boat was grossly overloaded.

Speaker 2:          01:55:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:55:33       Then Harrison pushed me up over the side and the two of us flopped down behind the and as the engine went into gear and the boat move towards the mid stream. So now they get across the river, they get dropped off. And, and to answer your question earlier, once they get dropped off and they're on the other side of the, they're on the western side of the Rhine River. It's basically secure area. Even though it was only, you know, several hundred yards away, it was relatively secure and now what they have to do is they have to march back about five miles to get to a even more secure base. Here we go back to the book as we reached the track, which after a few hundred yards let us to the road when I stopped, the men flopped to the ground, empty and lifeless, lacking any wish to go on more parties of men appeared for the darkness shambling in the exhaustion of relief, all terror ended, devoid of the willpower needed to summon up further effort. There was only one way to make the two mile march bearable and old fashioned remedy. I called the Sergeant Weiner to fall. The men in threes, the discipline bark bounced back to me as wiener pulled himself to his feet, shouting to the men to fall in. There was no trace of query or surprise in whiners voice and the men shuffled to their feet.

Speaker 1:          01:57:01       That's, that's your route training right there, that you're exhausted after eight days of continuous combat, you're just done. And the sergeant says, all right, on your feet form a column of threes and you do it. They're getting close to the end. I'm now, they can see the camp and I hosted them. There was only one way to end such a march. It was pointless perhaps. But I decided to make the final gesture, bringing them to attention. I ordered them to slope, arms and demarche by the left to attention. I sensed their appreciation as there's shoulders went back. This was the way they always returned to camp. This was the way they always finished. As they stepped off for the last 50 yards, they were even swinging their arms. So they march back into this camp. Once they get into this camp, they get loaded up into uh, a vehicle, a big military transport vehicle that's going to take them further to the rear where they can get some treatment and they're loaded into that for you.

Speaker 2:          01:58:08       Cool

Speaker 1:          01:58:12       and here we go. Back to the book, the canopy of the truck now sheltered us, but my shivering became uncontrollable. I knew I was becoming light headed and could hear myself grieving allowed for those that we had left behind, particularly for those who had been lost during the withdrawal down the river bank. There was silence in the truck. Then I heard as if from a long way off the voice of Sergeant Weiner clon calm and flat saying that none of them would've got back if it had not been for me. It was true to say that I would never have got back if it hadn't been for them, but I shall always be grateful to Weiner for having said it. The next thing I remember was Weiner and Harrison half carrying me into what seemed to be a hospital.

Speaker 2:          01:59:04       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:59:06       someone was stripping off my clothes and dressing me in pajamas. Then I felt the prick of a needle in my arm. I was awake. The Sun shining into the windows of the award, an orderly brought tea and food on a tray. I laid between the clean sheets, looking at the torn and filthy garments on the chair by the side of the bed. There was nothing wrong with me. Now I saw that my hand was wrapped in a clean bandage. When the nursing orderly came to remove the tray. He brought me the message that a soldier was waiting in the corridor to see me. As soon as the orderly left the room, I slipped out of bed and put on my clothes and went out into the corridor waiting. There was Harrison, a broad smile on his face telling me that captain gray and Mr Elkins and turned up with eight of the missing men. Another 20 stragglers had also arrived from somewhere or another, but that was the lot. That was the battalion three officers and 43 soldiers. We walked out the door of the hospital side side by side, the week September sun shone down on the battered buildings.

Speaker 1:          02:00:39       I'll way in the distance, the dull rumble of the battle still rolled down from the north

Speaker 2:          02:00:55       and once

Speaker 1:          02:01:02       all the men were recovered, and that's, that's the end of the book. And when all the men were recovered it, and when you look at the actual battalion of 156 the parish parachute battalion, it looked like this. 313 men were captured. Many of those were wounded. There was 98 killed in action and there was a total of 68 from the battalion that made it across the Rhine safely and those 68 men, if they could heal up, were then sent to the other battalions inside. The first pair of Rubber Dade and the hundred and 56th parachute battalion was actually disbanded. It ceased to exist. Jeffry Powell went on to retire from the army, the British army in 1964 he retired as a major general. He was awarded the military cross, which is Britain's third highest award for valor and this is what his citation reads at Arnhem numb after his commanding officer had become a casualty, Major Powell took command of the remnants of the battalion up to this time. He conducted himself with the greatest gallantry for the remaining six days. He retained control of his unit and also of the men of other units in the area under the most difficult conditions.

Speaker 1:          02:02:35       Heavy fire for mortars, artillery and self propelled guns never stopped, is it activity? And getting round his section of the perimeter and encouraging his men to greater efforts throughout the whole period of the and m battle. In spite of being wounded, this officer showed himself to be a gallant leader of men and the most capable fighter and one whose bravery was a source of inspiration to the men under his command and to all those around him. And I think it's pretty clear that if you will read a book like this, General Powell is still a source of inspiration as are the rest of these incredibly brave men.

Speaker 2:          02:03:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:03:31       And also a source of leadership lessons of what to do and what not to do. And it's also an incredible reminder of that heavy burden of command. And the fact of the matter is, when you lead, you own every decision and every action, not only of yourself, but of your men. And with that burden, you owe it to them.

Speaker 2:          02:04:14       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:04:15       To be as well prepared to be as tactically sound and to be as physically and mentally strong as you can possibly be. And that goes for any leadership position when you're a leader, be as prepared as you possibly can. And then you go out and you lead and you lead with courage and you lead with resolution and you lead with boldness, boldness like Jeffrey Pal, then the officers and the men of the hundred and 50, sixth parachute battalion. Pretty amazing book that,

Speaker 1:          02:05:15       you know, like I said, I got this book six days ago or something, somebody just sent it to me and I gave it the um, the little tests when I kind of opened books up cause people send me a lot of books and I gave it the, uh, I gave it the test. You know, I opened up, I read a couple sections and it immediately, you know, I'll give, I'll, I'll open to a book and four or five different places to see what it reads like. And this, you know, within the first page, the first page that I read, I said, oh, we, it looks like we have a winner here. This one's going to be on the podcast because it's just impactful. And the account. Now, the, in the back of the book, he talks about the, the individuals, just read some of them off here. The brigadier was General John Hackett. The colonel was Dickie Divo of the Grenadier guards. His fellow granted year was sergeant major, sergeant major dentist, Gay, his Batman, the guy that he talks about, Harrison throughout the book, the guy that's there from the beginning to the end, always by his side. That was actually a guy named Fred Tracy, a guy named David [inaudible] went in the book is the character in the book. The real guy was named Michael Page, who had been Powells best man and whose son Jeffery born posthumously had another son named Michael

Speaker 1:          02:06:54       and Luke Tyler and Sergeant Wiener and Jones and Johnson, as these were all real people. So, you know, this is another guy that uh, very similar to major John Glover who said he had a hard time writing about himself in the first person. You know, I did this and I did that, but it's the same thing that Powell said. You know, he had a hard time writing until he just made it about some other, he made some other character in his hand and vote from that perspective. But man, you definitely, this book I, like I said, I read, I don't know, 5% of it. It's not a huge book though actually. It's only a couple of hundred pages long and it's a very fast read. Did you find it to give you this weird stressful feeling reading now? Absolutely. Like listening to, it's like just more stress, stress. It is. And I was, I was debating when to tell you and when to tell everyone that, that this is not a good, that this isn't a good story, right.

Speaker 1:          02:07:54       That this isn't a positive thing. And I kinda just, I don't know. When I actually said that, hey, they're not going to win. I mean, I said that the, the operation market garden was, it was a failure, but you know, what does that really look like? You know what I mean? Like you don't know what that looks like until you get reading this book and then you start to feel what it feels like an absolutely. And when you read the whole book, man, it is just coming apart. It's just little misfortune, little miss four. And they're just coming in and they don't stop. They just don't stop. It's a, it's a nightmare scenario and yeah, and there's tons of great lessons learned. It's so, it's so amazing because I never read this book before. I just got it. Yeah. But it's amazing. Cover move. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:08:38       Decentralized Command. Even prioritize and execute. Even the apart when you're keeping it simple, right? Everything that, that we learned that, you know, I should've learned this years ago and when I think about, you know, I was, you, you, you look back at your life, right? And you say to yourself, what could I have done better? What could I do different? And you know, everyone in the seal teams, like basically you get one shot at each job other than just being uh, uh, a shooter and a platoon that you can do three or four times if you're lucky. But then once you get into a leadership position, you're like, you're an assistant platoon commander, you do that one time, then you're a platoon commander, you do that one time, then you're a task unit commander. You do that one time. Generally some guys, sometimes the guys rarely guys do more than one of those same thing on the enlisted side.

Speaker 1:          02:09:29       Guy Gets to do an uh, a leading petty officer does that one time chief petty officer of a platoon, platoon chief does that one time. Senior chief in charge of a task unit does that one time. You don't get to repeat the jobs. And so basically when you're finally getting good at your job, you're done and now you've got to go get the next job up the chain of command. So for me it was always, and now looking back and, and, and even talking to, talking to my seal buddies now, like, like how can we prepare them better so they know what we had to learn during the job. It's, it's, it's a hard thing to do because it's because a lot of stuff that you actually have to learn from experience. And actually we talked about that at the last muster, which is, that was a big part that we talked about. Your, if you're going to get good at something, you have two choices, experience or training and training as a way to condense, experience down and distill it. And that's what was great about when we, when I was running training on the west coast, we, we got to really condensed that experiential, I mean guys went through, guys went through hellacious

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       training and we're, we'd provide total chaos for them that most guys wouldn't experience that kind of chaos in their whole career or in 10 careers. But they would get it and they would get pushed super hard. So that way when they got out on the battlefield they were ready for the, for the chaos that was out there. Cause we trained him and we pushed him further and harder during training than we hoped they would get pestered pushed on the battlefield. Yeah. It was crazy. Even though that covering move, even when they're retreating it's like it showed like how you got to keep that, that discipline, that discipline. It's kind of like, you know like in an MMA fight or something and the guy who starts getting hit on the insight and rather than still covering up a little bit while he goes back, he like runs away or turns his back or something like that.

Speaker 3:          02:11:20       You don't turn your back and you're done. But great book. I definitely recommend it for your reading list. Yeah, there was a, there was that part in there that the guy came up to I think reload ammo or something and the guy's sitting there and he's just so he gets like scolded or whatever and you know, it turns out these wounded. Right. Like that's kind of, that was an interesting little lesson there. Like, you just don't know. You can't just start going off on. It's totally true. And, and I don't know if you remember, somebody asks us a question one time about, you know, how do I, these people that have had everything given to them and I, and I, you know, I've had, I grew up in a tough neighborhood and it's like, oh, you didn't, you actually don't know what that person's been through.

Speaker 3:          02:12:04       And we had that whole discussion. That's the same thing. True on a day to day basis with every other human being that you're dealing with. You don't know what they're going through. You don't know what triumphs and tragedies they've had in their life. You don't know what just happened to them this morning. So the recommended course of action as you give someone a little bit of slack when you don't know him, you know, you ever seen that at Seinfeld when he either goes to talk to that girl, come on. It was actually, it was, it was pretty much this, but just on Seinfeld. So he goes to talk to this guy. He's like, oh, I got to talk to that girl. She's hot. Whatever. He goes up to, and he's like, he's like, hey, hey, hello, excuse me. And her back has kind of turned, you know, he's like, excuse me, hello?

Speaker 3:          02:12:44       Hello? Like getting any starts to get real mad that she's not listening to him. Finally he walks like more close to her and she kind of starts to turn around and he's like, oh, so now you pay attention. What are you deaf? And she's like, Bingo. Like signs to them. Oh, she is death. You know where you got to chill out. Yeah. I'll find out about people for free start. They make sure the regimental sergeant major isn't wounded and both legs before you start dressing him down. I know. Yeah, man, that's a good thing he put that in this book. You know? That's pretty humble for him to put this in this book. You know what I mean? And that other part where there were all what? Like tired and stuff, right? Or they're defeated essentially. They were actually, you mean when they were broken?

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       Men. Yeah. And then they, and they got up and they just started charging, getting that default aggressive. Yeah. Yeah. The default, the default aggressive apart. That's like, um, like in Hawaii there's big centipedes no, then they're like, they're kind of, they're like, no, no, they're bigger than like send a pizza that I've seen here. Okay. Give me a figure like six inches, 12 it's six is like a normal, big centerpiece. Cinches they'll get bigger anyway there. I mean, compared to you, you know that there, there are little bugs, they're little, right, whatever, and you just step on it. But like when you start messing with it and it starts to get nuts, it's superintendent, I don't know. But they can chase you out of your room. You've got chased out of your robot, even like a, like a wasp or you don't like with these little things that are way smaller than you and they just get nuts and then, and like, you didn't want to mess with it, you know?

Speaker 3:          02:14:30       So Lafe Lafe was over. My house is a while ago, a couple of years ago. And, uh, there was a lizard in my house like about a nine inch lizard. And so my son and Lafe are going to try and catch this lizard and, and they're being weak. They're like, yeah, exactly. You're like, oh, you know, they're like, oh wait, wait, no, grab it, get a box on it and all that stuff. So I come in, Mister tough guy, you know, I come in, reached, I go, just grab that thing. You will cease reached down. I reached down to grab this thing, this thing turns its head and bytes and I screamed like a, like the Jim Carrey like right.

Speaker 4:          02:15:11       Oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:15:12       Flick my hand. It was, it was absolutely hilarious cause I went from being a big tough guy to screaming, um,

Speaker 4:          02:15:18       oh,

Speaker 3:          02:15:20       having a lizard bit on my finger Jube blood by the way. I drew blood. Yeah. All my thumb. So yeah, I was default aggressive, but it didn't work out. The, the, the lizard was more default aggressive than I was. Yeah. See and the end, that is funny. That's a funny story for a couple of reasons in my opinion. But that is the exact same concept though. You know, where if you would, uh, like how you said in the book just kept your head. You smashed that Lizard, all the five one to catch it alive. I wasn't trying to kill it. Yeah. But still I should have been more aggressive like the buyer and the bite didn't even hurt. Right. Yeah. I just shocked me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I wasn't ready for the, the gnashing of the teeth getting nuts. Yeah. Those lizards, we have a lot of those, especially when he gets hot.

Speaker 3:          02:16:04       I mean, I'm assuming it's the same time there are these, but here's the thing. Growing up on Kauai, there's these things they call them, we call them chameleons, but they're like, uh, no. Uh, no. Lay a n, m, O, l. E, that's he spent spell it. They, they turn green or brown or whatever and they get, they get pretty big and they're super aggressive. Like when you grab them, oh, that's the first lift. Red thing comes out of their neck and they start biting you and you get till when you hold them after a while they start to calm down. Yeah, I think they just start to get sick and stuff. I Dunno. I Dunno. But they calmed down. So you can do this thing where basically a kid, if he, if you have the Lizard Ted, you go like this and he'll go like that. He'll try to bite you.

Speaker 3:          02:16:42       So what you do is when he comes down on it, what ray, when you grab him, he's trying to kill you. But when he calms down after, I don't know, three, four minutes, you do that and he'll kill, keep kinda like he'll do less and less and less. Less and less. He'll always do that though, but it'll just be a lot less aggressive. And then if you put your finger in his mouth, he'll bite you and he won't let go. So you got to kind of drag your finger out and yet it'll, it can cause blood or whatever. But what we do is, and you can see pictures of this, we do that and we'd put it on, put the lizard on our ears. So the lizard would be an earring and hearing yeah, biting areas. You'd have two lizards hanging down. But anyway, the point there being fun if you can keep your, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:17:24       When you grow up with that stuff, like those lizards are not scary. Even if they're aggressive. And some of them, they get pretty like big and bulky and they're like, Dang, a state has some power to it. This little lizard, you know. And, but even here I it, when I grabbed them, they're like, oh no, I wouldn't have screamed like you explain the experiences with got me, dude. It was awful. It was awful. Well, um, being prepared I guess is what we're talking about, being aggressive. Why don't you get default aggressive with letting anybody know if they want to support this podcast and maybe how they could do it. Also support Jockos traumatizing experience with a lizard and this lizard bite his fingers and he was screaming, who wasn't leaf in who it was late. And my son. Yeah. Did they lose respect for you that time?

Speaker 3:          02:18:10       Well, it's actually funny cause Lafe always talks about, you know, me being calm and that's why he laughed so hard. We, we were driving one time and we almost got in a car wreck. He was driving actually, and I'll have him tell the story, but we hit mud and we hit, we were out in the desert, we're going 65 miles an hour on a back road back by all these farms. And it was two o'clock in the morning, three o'clock in the morning, something like that. And normally these roads are completely dry there in the desert and we're hauling and laced drive and I think he's driving his truck. Okay. What's driving this truck we're hauling and all of a sudden, out of nowhere we see, we see a big 18 wheeler on the side of the road on the opposite side of the road.

Speaker 3:          02:18:54       But it's a narrow road. Yeah. Yeah. And as we're hauling, all of a sudden we hit a water walker, probably a couple inches deep of water when mud, because it's what happened somewhere. Irrigation from all this farmland had broken and there was this flood. And so we hit this thing and we're immediately hydroplaning and, and Lafe is from Texas. Lafe is from Texas. So he did not used to driving in the snow. I grew up driving in the snow in New England. You know, you just, you just deal with it. Everyone's like a rally driver up there. Yeah. Yeah. That's so sad.

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       So and so leaf, he is not really used to this. And he starts to oversteer the car, which is really, really bad. And you know, I'm sitting there and we're going 65 miles an hour. He, he, he's funny when he tells a story too because he's like, we, we thought we were going to die. He thought he'd exactly, we were definitely die. And I'm sitting there in the passenger seat and I, and I say, don't oversteer don't overstay. No breaks, no breaks. Alright, you're good. Cause that's the other thing, mistake you can make. If you jam on the brakes, you're going to lock it up and you're going to slide, you're going to lose control. So I just don't understand it. Don't oversteer. No breaks. No breaks. Alright, you're good. So that was not my reaction when I got bit on the phone by the Lizard.

Speaker 5:          02:20:08       Ah,

Speaker 1:          02:20:11       it was hilarious.

Speaker 6:          02:20:14       Dang Bro. It's all good. But Hey man, you know, if you want to support this podcast, how about this? Talk about that possible. Do it. So one good way and support this is, well, okay. This is what it is. Origin, right? Origin, the brand origin main.com. That's the website. They've got a lot of cool stuff. One of the cool items, actually, there's a bunch are geese for Jujitsu. I remember back when kind of won't be first started this thing that's, that would be the main question about did you too was what kind of gear? And I'd be like, Oh yeah, there's these. And I give them the three. The top actually there was, there's four of them and it was shortly after where you recommended this, these origin ones. And then when I went there I was like, oh shoot, this is kind of expensive. I don't know.

Speaker 6:          02:21:02       You know? But then I just looked at the one that was like, it was like the first one I saw it, but there are many varying prices of keys and they're all good. By the way, I know this because I asked them nonetheless. If you're still wondering what kind of Geeky to get origin g hundred percent you have, um, options, you know, as far as pricing and stuff like that, if you want the deluxe one versus the more basic one. But they're all dope. And here's the thing about them. They're all made in America and not in the sense where they're just kind of assembled in America, but so, you know, the materials are sourced somewhere else. The materials are sourced. Would you call him sourced? I guess the raw material material comes from Tennessee, South Carolina, South Carolina, somewhere here. America. I know that mark boom brought over to Maine. Assembled smooth illume. Yeah, that's not a verb, right? Yeah. Woven on a loom, boom into this outstanding material. Moisture, what do you call it? [inaudible] right. That's when it kind of like helps with my sister. I didn't know all this, by the way. I'm being educated on it and there's lots to know by the way. Um, and I antimicrobial a big deal

Speaker 3:          02:22:28       anyway. Or do you mean.com? That's where you get school stuff. There's other stuff too, like rash guards and even like clothes, regular clothes, athletic wear. It's still anyway, all made in America. Boom. Also for some legitimate fitness gear on it.com/jocko. I just got the, I know I'm into kettlebells. I know I said that before. I'm a, say it again. What is yours? What is your heaviest Kettlebell? You have 40 kilograms, right? So 88 dots. Okay. Mine's 94, by the way. I have two of them. Oh, do you only have one? I do only have one. I only have one currently. Alright, well shoot, I guess you know, it's clear what I gotta do. Maybe I'll get another one, step it up. But um, shoot, who was I talking to about it? Oh yeah, Morgan, you know Morgan, right? We were talking, we were talking about kettle bells and some Morgan's feeling strong.

Speaker 3:          02:23:21       I told him that yesterday. Yeah. Not, not just because that's, it's kind of an insult in Jujitsu. Yes. Yeah. Like, Hey, you feel really strong city. Yeah, but I made it perfectly clear yesterday. I was like, Hey, you feel Jujitsu strong? I said, it's not, I'm not trying to say you feel strong like, hey, you're a meat, you're a meathead, but you feel strong in a positive way because, and I said, here's the deal. If it was just you being strong than five years ago when I started training here and be like, oh, you feel strong. I didn't say it then because you didn't feel strong. You feel strong now that your juice is getting better and, and you're getting more skills. Yeah. I feel like we got to come up with a different expression or maybe just a modified expression because some people, yeah, like they'll, people tell me I'm strong or whatever, and after awhile I was like, wait, I felt the same thing that you one time I told you like you're strong.

Speaker 3:          02:24:16       I thought it was kind of, maybe subconsciously I thought it was kind of established that, okay, look, you're really good at Jujitsu. You know, I thought that was kind of a given. So if I were to tell you your song, it'd be kind of like it. I like, Oh yeah. I was like, we're like, no, my technique. You're just like, no, my technique. I was like, yeah, no, no. I know that. I know your technique is outstanding. Yeah. Little bit. Not In an angry way or nothing like that, but actually surprise, I wasn't, uh, a little bit more sarcastic about it. See, okay. And which to me, I'm surprised that it and say, yeah, I'm glad I'm so strong that I can just, you know, when people say it and I know people don't mean it, I know they don't mean that. How we take it kind of like you're strong. It's your, your physical strength, not your Jiu Jitsu technique. That's what we take it as, you know, and they're just throwing it in like how essentially how I did with you. It's kind of like, look, you're better than you did to then me, you, you beat me up all the time. But in addition to that, you're pretty strong. I, that's probably what people were saying most of the time, but so when people would be like, Dang, you're strong, your grip, you don't, when they say you're strong, I say yeah, I lift a lot of weights.

Speaker 6:          02:25:24       So it kind of gives them the impression kind of like yeah, my weightlifting basically beats your Jujitsu kind of thing and that's a more of an insult, you know kind of thing. But it's a joke really. You know nonetheless. So yes Morgan, he's strong Jujitsu so he's technique is strong so that means it's just a technique is getting better and it and it reveals it can deliver the strength in the proper way. Yes. Good Job Morgan. But we were talking about kettle bells and he was like, Bro, cattle catapults off hard. So I started to feel kind of good because I got this 90 pound one and I was like, I lifted it up and you know, okay. You know that's the one hand boom, clean, clean press is their eggs. If you, you should legs to snap it up there a little bit. Yes. That is the clean and jerk.

Speaker 6:          02:26:09       Okay. Even one hand if you just do, if you don't use any legs and you just powered up smoothly, that's oppressed. Okay. So mine is clean and jerk. I Turkeys the whole kind of body or whatever. So my metcons they do, when I got the Werewolf ones, those are like 62 pounds. I do two at a time. Boom, boom. Okay. Easy. And you'd do reps, you know, it's a little thing. So I got the s the gorilla one's 72 pounds and I can do that one just as you get strong, you know? So I get the 90 pound one. I'm like, I only got one too. So I dunno. Do you think two at one time is easier because of the balance? Right? No, it's not easier. I mean you using more energy for sure. But as far as like doing the ballot, not easier. Yeah. Okay. Well so one is easier doing one. One is for sure. He's okay. Good. Well, okay, Gotcha. So I got one big foot that's 90 pounds and I lifted that off. I was like, man, I'm not right.

Speaker 6:          02:27:04       And so it was like maybe two, three days later I was like, well, I got to try. That's the, you know, I got the 72 pound one, I can do that, you know, a bunch of times actually. But so I just warmed up a bunch and just first time I did it, like I straight up failed, I couldn't do it. And I was like, all right, all right and I know how it feels now and all this stuff and then then I can do it. Boom. Both your boom. Yeah. Well that's good. Solid. Glad we all know that now. Yup. Hey God. And that's relevant. Just say actually, which is actually what makes kettlebells kind of fun to do is because it does require legitimate technique. Like you can't, like it's hard. It's like a dumbbell or a barbell or a machine. If you're doing barbell snatches, it takes a hell.

Speaker 6:          02:27:50       Yeah. And that's really the spectrum, you know? So if you go, like if you're just kettlebell and then dumb cause dumbbells a straight up balanced, I mean they're not, they're not like a PR but they have a handle both sides of the handle, equal amount of weight, you know, boom. You just have to balance your body and then after you get that balance down, this pretty easy barbell, even less because you don't have two sides gotta be balanced. It's just one long thing and then two sides of that is balanced. Then you go machine, you don't even need balance. You just need this tank to push. So it's that spectrum to the kettle bell. It's way on this side of the spectrum where it kind of, there's the game within the game, you know? That's what makes it more fun. I think you see progress in both areas. Technique and strength.

Speaker 6:          02:28:30       Anyway, we'll leave it at that. If you want the cool kettle bells on it.com/jocko or jump ropes battle maces the weight, do you call them battle Macy's or just maces yeah, those are kind of clubs. Yeah. Though you can get some cool workouts with that. And they like your forearms get I, I didn't look into like what exactly, you know they're going to improve, but I know core strength and all this stuff, but there's all these little things they improve to outstanding stuff. Also, good way to support if you're going to get this book men at how do you, how do you pronounce it? The place him art and Ham or men aren't him Jeffry Powell. That's how I pronounce it anyways. I'm apologize to anyone that's from Holland. Yeah. And pronounces it a different way. I looked at it on youtube and how they set it and there was like they say, oh, how to pronounce Our Name and there's 14 different ways to say it.

Speaker 6:          02:29:28       So I just rolled the dice and pick one that sounded easiest for me to say. So sorry if I'm saying it wrong. Hey Man. No, all good. Um, but if you want to get that book or any other book that Jack or reviews on the website, just go to Jocko podcast.com on the top menu. Then click on books from episodes. All the books are listed there by episode along with the few other things, but mainly just the books by episode. You Click through there, boom, takes you to Amazon, get those books there. That's a good way to support this. The Amazon Click through or if you do any other shopping, if you're getting a tripod or a video camera or duct tape or whatever, click through there. Boom. That's a good way to support. Great Way to support. Also a little addition there. You know how we had the uh, website Jocko podcasts to [inaudible] dot com that's a, there's a long story.

Speaker 6:          02:30:25       I think I went into it. It was like when I was like testing, like what website provider, whatever. I was like, let me get this one because what if I'm attached to it and it's a long story and then so we ended up getting Jocko podcast.com and they're both kind of there, but Jack podcast too was kind of the, the the primary one. It's not the primary one anymore. Jocko podcast. It's Jocko podcast.com okay, so that's good website. And that was actually a trooper. That's straight up goddess Jocko podcast looking out for us cause he, and then that's a big deal. So I'm in New York. Good Dude. Yeah, that's a huge deal because um, like do you have your own name? Yeah. Okay. So people will be like, Oh this guy's blowing off. They'll go and they'll buy the domain name. Either hold onto it or immediately go to you and be like, Hey, you want to buy this from me? Yeah, they hold it hostage. In fact, I think there might be like a legal like defense against it. Like if someone gets your name or your, your kid's name and your kind of a public figures, I think, I'm not sure. But yeah, that's what people do. Men, they'll or they'll buy a bunch of domain names that sound cool and they'll be like, yeah, you can buy this from me kind of thing. It's super whack when they do it with like Euro, you know when,

Speaker 3:          02:31:38       no, that's your company or your CEO hat for a long time. They, I don't know what they paid for eventually paid for ufc.com but for a long time they were like the ufc.tv and all these other UFC, but they had to step up. I bet you they, I bet somebody made a lot of money off that one. Yeah. Especially the three letters I guess. Like if you get the last letter tomorrow morning,

Speaker 6:          02:32:00       crazy town nonetheless. But yeah, Jocko, podcast.com that's the main website. Now if you were going to Jocko podcast too.com, it's not that anymore. Does that sound to you though over? Uh, it, it does. Did, but while I'm switching, I'm doing this thing. It will eventually, yes. But if you run into that, that's why God will have been hitting me up and rightly so. Thanks for that. Um, so yeah, none the less back to the point. If you want to support and by getting these books go through the website and clicked through there, it's a good way to support small action. Huge reaction. Small, huge. That's how it works. Also, subscribe to the podcast iTunes. If you haven't already, stitcher, if you don't use I o s I film Google play any anywhere they where they provide a podcast. Boom, we're on there. So subscribe. That's a good way. Also Youtube. Yes. I put some excerpts on there. More excerpts. I'm gonna continue to do so. Shareable excerpts. Tried to keep them under four minutes. That's cool. Right? For

Speaker 3:          02:33:03       Yeah. Might be a little long. But I every once in a while you get it like a good like 10 minute one though for sure thing. But they're more shit better than to think about what the video is that you, you want to get compression. Three minutes, four minutes tops. Yeah. And it depends on the, you should edit them. Maybe like make them shorter.

Speaker 6:          02:33:21       Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. I mean if it's appropriate because sometimes you don't want to, sometimes it's just you saying like a whole thing and it's like okay that's solid and sometimes it's you. And then my rebuttal to kind of kind of bolster the point, your point. Cause you'll clarify it because I, you know, and it's all, it's, it makes sense. So sometimes if you edit certain things out and maybe the message isn't there as much as maybe it should be. Not all the time, not all the time, but most of the time unless I'll look into it. How about that? Ideally if a video, and this goes along with like people's typical like attention span should be what? Like about a minute and a half.

Speaker 3:          02:34:06       I don't know. But my attention span is getting tested right now. Right. Just

Speaker 6:          02:34:12       saying we this is important stuff. We need to go over this so we can come to the conclusion on how to conduct ourselves in regards to youtube excerpts and other things. Nonetheless, subscribe to Youtube Channel. It's good. We're going to provide value. How about that? No. All if you're into the video version, cause some people are, some people are into more the video version of the podcast. Yeah. You know, boom. Subscribe if you haven't already. Youtube also Jocko has a store. It's called Jocko store. Jacqueline [inaudible] dot com and if you didn't already know, um, on there we've got some cool stuff. Shirts, mainly some rash guards. I just made an order for hoodies. Thicker, heavier fall is coming. Are we in fall right now? The fall was the first day of fall was like the other day we are in fall. Yeah. So we got some, not that we're doing a whole seasonal thing.

Speaker 6:          02:35:07       I'm just saying it's fall now. Getting cool eating cooler check. Got Some hoodies on there. I've got some shirts on there. Got some rash guards on there. I think I'm going to do a warrior kid rash guard. I have one but it's not in production yet. Yeah. And it's not, I'm going to change it a little bit, some coloring stuff and whatever, but it is pretty cool. Good, good little pre response. Um, also hats on there and some other cool stuff. I'm not saying get something I'm saying go on there, check it out. If you want to support and you want to get something, he thinks something is cool for yourself or for your, you know, friend, wife, girlfriend, neighbor, whoever. Didn't get something good way to support actually a great way to support also psychological warfare. Okay. What psychological warfare is. If you don't know, it's an album with Jocko tracks. So basically if you're on your campaign against weakness and you have a moment of weakness, this is like a little spot. So basically you put on these audio tracks to let you know, hey, pragmatically, don't skip this workout today. Hey, don't slip on this diet today. Hey, your procrastination isn't working and here's why, but it's chocolate telling you. So it's kind of like more effective, way more effective. Hundred percent success rate in my experience. 100%

Speaker 3:          02:36:39       that's legit. Yeah. A also Jocko white tea, if you want it, you can get that on Amazon. It tastes good and it makes you feel good also on origin main.com you can get Jocko Super Krill Krill oil that will make you feel good. And on top of that you can get Jocko joint warfare, which is awesome. What's in that, by the way? It's glucosomine can droid and those are the main, the main, but then we put some additional things in there. Um, yeah, and it's, it's been rocking it. It's,

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       it's awesome. You've got books or I've got some books if you want to read them. One is called way of the warrior kid. One is called extreme ownership. The Warrior kid book is for kids. Extreme ownership is for people in leadership positions or people that want to be in leadership positions. There's also a new book coming out called discipline equals freedom field manual. It actually comes out October 17th and at one point many months ago, October 17th seemed like it was a long ways away, but it's not anymore. It's here so you can order that one. It is unlike any book that you have ever seen or read. Also, what's interesting about this book is people keep asking me if it's going to be on the audible is not going to be on audible. Hmm. Instead of being on audible, it is going to be on iTunes. It's going to be on Amazon, MP three it's going to be on Google play.

Speaker 1:          02:38:05       It's going to be where you can find MP three tracks. There's a reason for this. If you do it through audible, you get this one big long book and it's in what the book is. The way the book is written, it's written to be chunked up and you're going to want to take parts of it and play it at certain times more like you would do with the psychological warfare album. So people were asking for more psychological warfare. That's what we're doing. Discipline equals freedom field manual. It's going to be available as an album that you can buy and then you can do what you want with the tracks. You can make them your alarm ring tone, you can listen to them out of order in any order. You can put them into mixed. You can do a lot more stuff with them. That's why we're doing it as an album with tracks instead of as an audible book. So you know what we might, you know, people might have a little challenge finding it or realizing, you know when they go on to Amazon or they go on to Barnes and noble, they won't see that it's available. There'll be looking for the audible. Then you won't be able to find it.

Speaker 3:          02:39:04       I'm sorry. Yeah, we'll just an audible, I think that's where they won't, you won't find it in the audible platform, right? Will not be there. It'll be on Amazon. It'll be on Amazon, but I don't think it will be linked in to the same thing where you go, oh, here it is. I think it's going to be hidden and it's gonna be hard to find. Kind of like, it's hard to find on iTunes. It's hard to find psychological warfare, but the question is, do you want to do, did I want to do something right or just do something easy? Yeah, that's true. Because the field manual, like any field manual, like when you want to go refer to it, you don't want to be searching around and be like, okay, what does that one part? You know that deals with this and boom, you can just go to them. You just look for the track name and either, so like I said, we could have done the easy thing and and

Speaker 1:          02:39:48       whatever, you know, had everyone just being able to click on it real easy. I apologize, but if you want the right way then that's what I had to do. So that's that book and then Echelon Front, that's the leadership consultant company that I have with wave Babin with JP to know Dave Burke.
