Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number one 66 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening and we are rolling straight into part three podcast number three of the psychology for the fighting man. What you should know about yourself and others. So if you haven't listened to the previous two podcasts, there are about the same book and there's so much information that we split it up because it was going long. And this part, these couple of sections here are really what I was originally going to cover, but then I figured I'd cover it all. And next thing you know this turned into three podcasts series tool and this section is called the soldier's personal adjustment.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       And here we go back to the book. In a demo in a democratic civilian army, millions of men are suddenly abruptly thrown into a new way of life. It is in many ways a tough life. Men used to going their own ways, choosing their own jobs, associates neckties times for going to bed now have to follow military orders about all these things men accustomed to a comfortable litter of belongings around them. Find the bear neatness of police barracks, hard to get used to. Those used to steam heat, warm shower baths and breakfast. Eggs cooked just three and a half minutes at home may be pretty uncomfortable when they have to put up with a bed on the ground and cold water for shaves. There is moreover no privacy in the army. If a man over sleeps and is corporal dumps him out of his bunk, the whole company knows about it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:55       If he looks at his girls photograph a lot, they know that to the business of living in a goldfish bowl and having to take razzing of from his fellow soldiers is about the hardest thing for a sensitive recruit to get used to. That's a fact. So here we go. These are all just welcome to the military. You're going to, you're not going to get to eat what you want to eat. You're not going to get to sleep when you want to sleep. You're not going to get to keep what you want to keep. Think about those a personal freedoms and everybody cherishes. They're all gone. Even your privacy when you get to, when I went to Navy boot camp, you go in the bathrooms, there's just stalls. There's no, I'm sorry. There's just toilets. There's no stalls. You just sit down next to everyone else and do your business through privacy is gone. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:44       Not every man of course meets hardships for the first time when he goes to the army. Some of known hunger and cold and hard work, some never saw flushed toilet or a shower bath before they got to camp. Some never had a good square meal. Well cooked for them. The army is providing luxuries. That's true too. Not Probably. It's definitely not as true now as it was in 1942 yeah, because in 1942 some people were still living out in the Bush here in America and there's a lot less people still living in the bush and America now. They're still out there though, but farmer lawyer, banker section, hand college man or man of little schooling, they all must adjust themselves to an entirely new way of living. All must learn new habits. Young men may find it easier to make the adjustment than older men because they are ordinarily a little more flexible with habits. A little less fixed. That's for sure. If you think you're going to join the military at some point, join when you're as young as possible. No attachments and I was so

Speaker 2:          00:03:48       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:48       Just dumb, I guess for lack of a better word, I just didn't care about anything. When I came in were like, uh, we're going to shave your head. We're going to take all your civilian stuff. I'm like, whatever, take it away. I don't care. But most men can fit themselves into the new life and work without too much friction. Those who do not, those who do it most easily are the ones who accept the new life at wants. Throw off civilian habits with civilian clothes and put themselves wholeheartedly into becoming soldiers. One of the hardest adjustments come with a loss of contact with family and friends. The soldier who misses friends at home is slow about making new friends at camp.

Speaker 2:          00:04:24       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:04:24       so there you go. If you are homesick, what you should do is make new friends. The army is liberal with furloughs as war permits from such homesick men when they first go into the service, but the real remedy is not in hurry trips home or long distance telephone calls. It is in building up of new interests and new ties in and around the camp.

Speaker 1:          00:04:50       Yeah. When I left home, I left home, I was gone and just that was that. One of the fears that many men have to overcome or adjust to when they first go into the army is the feeling that they may lose their identity, their freedom of individual expression from revel, Lita taps. There is little, if any opportunity for the new recruit to do anything he's not told to do whether he wants to or not. He must get up at the sound of the Bugle, put on the prescribed uniform march when he has commanded stand at attention, when he has ordered and do so even when with a mosquito biting him. No longer does he eat when he's hungry or go to sleep when he is tired. All conduct seems to be according to order. Is this really a fight for freedom and democracy? Of course it is, but conformity and discipline are necessary for the efficient operation of an army.

Speaker 1:          00:05:41       And I will say this, it's only that strict during boot camp. I mean for the most part during boot camp, that's when you really are, every movement that you make is based on what you're being told to do once you get into the fleet or out into the, uh, into a battalion somewhere. It's definitely, it's not easier, but you do have more individual freedom. So you, some people want to talk to a kid that's 16 and they are west. They're worried about, well you know, I really like to whatever I like to surf and I don't want to give up surfing. You'll have time to surf if you're stationed somewhere, you know, joined the coast guard cause they're always stationed near the water. You know, there's an idea.

Speaker 1:          00:06:26       Next a soldiers worries. There is first the fear of death. It is best met by accepting the possibility of death as a natural part of the job. And by being careful not to lose a sense of proportion about it. Again, it's weird for me to read this book cause that's if you had asked me that before I read this book and that's what I would have told you you have to do is be like, yeah, there's a chance I'm going to die and if you're scared of that, you should try and get over it. And I think the sense of proportion that's saying like, listen, okay, the world's not going to end if I die. No soldier is so important that he isn't justified in thinking the enemy is aiming every, oh, that's what they're talking about. This is that the sense of proportion is no soldiers and so important that he's justified in thinking that the enemy is aiming every bullet bomb and shell at him.

Speaker 1:          00:07:18       Besides there are great many men in the army and only a small proportion get hit in battle and the greater part of those who get hit will live and get well earned relief from the strain of combat. After that, there may be a purple heart decoration and some glory. This is when we're starting to lean a little bit towards propaganda. They were like, listen, you're probably not going to die. Which that is true. And the, the amount of people that are in the military can be compared to the amount of people that go into combat compared to the people that actually make contact with the enemy compared to the people that actually get hit. It's a very small percentage and if you do get hit, guess what? You got some glory and a purple heart coming your way. Don't worry about it. Yeah, like I said, this sometimes is leaning a little bit towards propaganda in a positive and truthful way, but you got to, you got to take it with a grain of salt. As they say back to the book, and soldiers who have been through the worst of warfare are inclined to say that only a fool wants to live forever.

Speaker 1:          00:08:25       They usually add the warning, but if you must die, make your death count for something. Don't throw your life away by taking needless chances. So that's the old again, uh, some, some propaganda for you there. Hey listen man. Only a fool wants to live forever. Let's go get some, and like I said, there is some truth to that. Back to the book. Sensitive men may also worry or feel guilty over killing enemy soldiers, other men in action, unless they understand this, worry in face it squarely they may head into trouble because killing is the main job of a combat soldier,

Speaker 2:          00:09:08       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:09:09       This is something people tend to forget from time to time,

Speaker 2:          00:09:12       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:09:13       The job of a soldier is to kill people,

Speaker 2:          00:09:16       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:09:17       From the earliest childhood, American boys are taught that it is wrong. The greatest wrong to kill. This principle is learned so early that it becomes part of them. As boys grow up, they forget most of what happened in infancy and early childhood. Few people in fact can remember much of what happened in their first three years. Yet they retained within themselves. The attitudes formed during the their earliest years. They don't remember ever learning them. It seems as if they always felt that way. If a man did not learn that it was wrong to kill until he was grown, he would learn it then with it, with his mind, and he would be easy to lay aside that rule when war or emergency makes it necessary for him to kill.

Speaker 2:          00:10:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:01       But the don'ts learned in earliest childhood become the voice of the conscience in the adult. They seem to be absorbed rather than learned. And even though his mind tells a grown man that the execution of criminals is justified, his emotions may rebel. Then if duty forces him to kill, he may go ahead and do it, but afterwards he'll feel a vague, uneasiness and anxiety. His conscience won't rest. Some men strictly brought up, may even get sick at the sick, at the stomach, at the site of a limp, pathetic body of a rabbit that has been shot. The Cure for the exam anxiety that results from this kind of conflict between conscience and reason is to understand it. Once a man realizes that the feeling is natural in men brought up as an average American to respect human life, this particular worry won't haunt him so much. He may have a few bad dreams, but that won't interfere with doing the job ahead. Disagreeable though it may be. Again, this is one where we're trying to let people know that, hey, what you feel when you feel all like, I don't feel like I want to go kill people. That's okay, we get it. Here's why you feel that way. You feel that way because you've been told that since you were a little kid, but you have to bring your reason into the problem and logically calculate that it's okay to kill people.

Speaker 1:          00:11:27       Tough. This is, this is, this is trying to tell a generation of American kids that they're going to go and fight and kill the enemy. That's what this is doing.

Speaker 2:          00:11:39       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:11:40       And even letting them know like, listen, you may have a few bad dreams, right? And that is probably one of the most minor ways of explaining the fact that you are going to have freaking nightmares, cold sweats. And they're, they're downplaying that, but they're letting them know that that's what's going to happen. So this is, this is definitely a book called the psychology psychology for the fighting man, and they're trying to use some psychology here to get the guys in the right mindset where they can kill next to the healthy mind to be at his best. A soldier must keep his mind fit as well as his body. He must be mentally alert and accurately aware of his surroundings. He must shoulder responsibility willingly

Speaker 1:          00:12:35       and except the dictates of superior officers without resentment. That's interesting. They used the word resentment, not without question, but without resentment. He must be able to get along with other men without undue friction and with mutual pleasure. That's important. Undue friction. There's going to be friction. You're working with other human beings. All other human beings are crazy. The marks of a man with healthy mind or personality are, and that's one thing. This book continues to do well as it makes these little lists. So here's the marks of a man with a healthy mind or personality. One, he uses his abilities with enthusiasm and satisfaction, although not always with happiness or full contentment. Okay, so, Eh, you know, I might not be totally into this, but I'm going to get it done the best possible way to, he wants to do something worthwhile to pull his load and not be carried by others.

Speaker 1:          00:13:34       It's interesting how a lot of this stuff is in full alignment with some Jordan Peterson activities. Someone's Jordan Peterson statements, right? Shoulder responsibility willingly. I think that's a, I think maybe Jordan read this book. It is a psychology book and he says maybe he read this book and started snatching good material from it. We're on to you JP. Uh, but yeah, and even this thing, man wants to do something worthwhile. Jordan Peterson talks about that all the time. He gets along with other persons including his superiors and those with whom he has a difference of opinion. Very important. How often is it we see people that I don't agree with your opinion, therefore I don't like you and I can't get along with you. So lame, so lame. I actually welcome people that have differing opinions than me because maybe they can teach me something. Maybe I can learn something from their viewpoint for when he is disappointed or meets with deprivation or strain. He faces the situation with constructive ideas and a fighting spirit, not with fear, rage, hopelessness or suspicion. So then he does not

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       suffer from in debt, indigestion, headache or pain, which though not all at all, voluntary may be produced by mental troubles.

Speaker 1:          00:15:05       So that's how you meet like problems with a good attitude, not with fear, rage and hopelessness. Five he perseveres in the effort to solve a problem or complete a task in spite of the difficulty and disappointment. Check perseverance. Six he likes to give as well as take

Speaker 1:          00:15:27       check. You ever known those kinds of people that when they say that they can give but they can't take? Yes. Yeah. Those people are fun to hang around. They never recognize it either. Yeah. And then if you call someone on it, like of course it's a denial, denial, denial in a defensive way, which is exactly what you're talking about cause you, you, you are proving my point right now. Continuing on some break down mentally because they are just not fitted for army life. They never should have been inducted in the first place. Physicians at Induction Centers Watch carefully for the signs of beginning mental illness. But nevertheless, some slip by and actually go through a pretty good chunk explaining that just you're not gonna catch every person, that

Speaker 1:          00:16:14       that has a possibility of having some kind of a mental illness of some of them are going to end up and you've got to be ready to deal with them. And those are the people that he, they say or four doomed to develop a mental illness. But then there's people beyond them. And here we go. In addition to those men who seem for doomed to develop a mental illness, there are other men who break in the army under battle conditions. These are real battle casualties just as much as if they had lost a leg. So this is interesting because we hear all these people talking about PTSD and whatnot as if it's new and as if it was unrecognized. This book is written in 1942 and they're saying, hey, somebody that suffers that kind of a stress under battle conditions. That's a casualty. Just like losing the leg.

Speaker 1:          00:17:03       So there you go. Yeah, and that's the part that's kind of well themes anyway, new is that it's just as traumatic as the physical damage and like you said, it seems new, right? It seems new, but this is World War II and we just don't, we always have to learn the same lessons over and over again. Why is that? Why do we have to learn the same lessons over and over and over again? It's a horrible reality. Back to the book. A man in battle may receive a blow on the head that will cause injury to the brain that is serious, particularly if he is a leader responsible for the direction and safety of his men. This is an interesting point. Since the brain itself has no sense organs, a man does not feel when his brain is injured and may think he is not been badly hurt.

Speaker 1:          00:17:53       This is how we end up with guys with Tbi, with traumatic brain injuries cause they don't, your brain gets rocked around, but it doesn't, it's not like a bruise. It's not, it's not aching. I mean, he'd get a little bit of a headache once you want you to experience a big boss like the next day, and I wonder why I got a little headache. There's a reason for that, but even what seems like a slight wound in the head must be looked after carefully. Usually the wounded man should be relieved from duty. If even a small part of his brain is hurt or his head is received a hard blow, which does not even crack the skull, nevertheless, he's likely to be confused or to act in a peculiar way in battle. So I think it's funny, it looked, you got to blow that didn't even crack your skull.

Speaker 1:          00:18:31       They're like, that's their, that's their assessment. It's, it can't be that bad. It didn't even crack your skull. A even a guy that didn't crack his skull needs to get checked out and needs a little break back to the book. A direct blow on the head is not the only way a man's brain can be injured. The blast of a shell nearby can cause harm to the brain. Modern helmets, however, protect the soldiers that years in his brain very well. That's kind of rubbish. The uh, how the helmet protects your ears and our helmets obviously or even more modern than the World War II. Uh, steel helmet that there were at least ours are made of Kevlar. No, that's not going to protect your ears. What we do have the protectors know is we were a lot of, a lot of people wear headphones for your radio and they have noise canceling headphones so that that does protect your ears.

Speaker 1:          00:19:25       Is it the kind that like go over, you go over your ears and then there are ones that go inside your ears too depending on what you like. But yeah, most of most people are wearing noise cancelling headphones that go over both of yours and they pick up noise from the outside and they, they uh, mute down. Yeah, really loud noises. Now one thing that's key, when you're wearing a headphones, those headphones on both ears, you lose. There's something that you lose. There's a couple of things that you lose. You lose the ability to tell distance how far away something is and where it's coming from and you lose the ability to tell where it's coming from. So if you see pictures of like me of life of Stoner, most of the time we have one year on in one ear off and, and sometimes people would ask, people see a picture of like, what don't you have your headphones on, here's why you want to be able to hear direction that someone's yelling for you and you want to be able to tell somewhat what the distances and those things are just gone.

Speaker 1:          00:20:31       Then you have the noise canceling headphones on, noise canceling, kind of go in your ears. There's donuts. There are interesting. Yeah. The ones, the ones that I have for shooting do that, you know, it has a little volume thing and, and also I don't, obviously, I don't know exactly how they made them to work, but the, it's like one, a gunshot goes off, it actually mutes everything. So if I'm talking to you and you know, a gunshot goes off like that for that instant use, you go off to, you know, yeah. And the deal, it is true. You don't know where it's coming from. So he could be over here literally on the opposite side. You know, it's crazy. Yeah. So for guys that are in the military or in some kind of law enforcement where you're, where you're wearing those headsets, just be advised.

Speaker 1:          00:21:16       And I wouldn't go to the point where I'd cut that other headphone off. I would keep it, I just push it behind my ear and wear it that way all the time. And that way if I needed to, I could put both headphones on because you can also run, and this is another thing that's a challenge in a leadership position as you can run two different radio frequencies, one into each ear. Uh, and so when that's going on, then you've got two voices coming in at the same time talking about different things. And it takes a little bit of practice to get used to that. And actually it's something that they say women are better at than men. Yes sir. They ran a test. Have you read that? Yes. Yeah. I read some research about it, but women can listen to two conversations easier than men can listen to two conversations.

Speaker 1:          00:21:58       But can they draw a bicycle while we've been through this before? It's risky. That's a risky conversation. The same study that or it wasn't the same study? It was a presentation. It was like a video with the article. It was the same one that said about the drawing the bike thing as the carry on tooth conversations or multitask in certain ways where it requires concentration. All this stuff. Yes they are. Yeah. That's interesting. That's why like my wife can literally be on the phone and like watch a TV show that you have to follow. You don't like do that kind of stuff. And I'm like the hot breath, you can't watch this show. You can be like shopping for curtains at the same time. You know like there were watching the show, are we shopping for Kirk dance kind of thing. But they can do that.

Speaker 1:          00:22:40       The so they have a little advanced skill there. So the modern helmets, they don't practice. They don't protect your head from shell blast at all. Even our helmets today, they don't. Going back to the book, besides these direct injuries to the brain, men in battle can suffer shocks to the mind every month. Every man has his limit mentally as well as physically. There are strains which no man, however tough minded minded Ken ender, modern battle has pushed closer and closer to these final limits of man's endurance, grueling hardships, great fatigue, prolonged loss of sleep, blistering heat, intense cold, high altitudes, great pressures below the sea. These are all conditions that put a dangerous strain on the mind as well as body. When a man goes through these things and then in addition suffered the strain of seeing his friends killed, of being in constant peril of his own life, of dealing out death with his own hands. There may come a time when the strongest man's mind will sicken

Speaker 1:          00:23:54       such a sufferer from war shock is not a weakling. He is not a coward. He is a battle casualty. If given psychiatric first aid promptly, he will probably recover to take his place again in the battle unit if neglected, however, he may become permanently ill or may even seek relief of his mental wounds in death. So again, this is 1942 and we still hear information about this nowadays. Like it's a revelation and it's not. And you know, people trying to seek relief by committing suicide. That's what they're saying here. Seek relief from mental wounds in death. What does that, that suicide and also, and I think to me it's always dick winters that always, uh, I always get reminded that he's the guy that would say, look, if you've got a guy that's getting close, you pull them off the battle line and you let them recover and he'll be fine.

Speaker 1:          00:24:58       If you don't pull them off the battle line, he's gonna break. He's going to be no good. The red, it's the engine, it's the engine, the car engine running in the red. The car engine is running in the red. You need to get it to a service station and get that thing serviced, give it a little breather. And then it'll be fine. If you get an engine running in the red and you keep running it, guess what's going to happen? You're gonna blow off the engine, it's going to be done. It's going to be ruined.

Speaker 3:          00:25:19       Yeah. So it's kind of like when you kind of go down that path, when you think about it, you know, people who commit suicide just in general, you know, it kind of is like kind of got to think about that. Like they were probably in one way or another injured right in their brain, whether it be, you know, for one, you know, by one way or another.

Speaker 1:          00:25:39       I think you just, you can't just, when you say injured, we're not just talking about physical injury, we're talking about whatever stress, massive amount of stress deaf all seeing all this May, I'm in chaos. Yes. So yeah, they have seen, you got to assume that someone that gets there in these cases has seen something that's so bad or suffered through something that's so bad that they seek relief from these mental stresses in death.

Speaker 3:          00:26:08       Yeah. So even like a, like a nonmilitary person where you know, like it's common for people to be like, oh, he took the easy way out, the coward kind of thing, right. He committed suicide kind of thing. But if you do really hundred percent regarded as an injury, just like your arm or your leg or something like that, it's kind of like it, it seems like a little bit more understandable almost

Speaker 1:          00:26:34       rather than calling them a coward outright. Yeah. I'm, I'm not, I'm not sure about that. I think that, I think that the most important thing is to recognize that if someone hurts their arm and they keep going on it, their arm is not going to get better. Right. If someone breaks their leg and they keep running on it, their leg is not going to get better. And if someone's got a, got some massive amount of stress that causes a mental injury, physical, mental injury or mental psychological, mental injury, either one of those. If they don't take a break and get some help and get some relief, then it's going to not work. It's going to break completely. Yeah. And then they get to a point where this is what we talk about when we talk about being in a cloud and everywhere you look around, there's nothing but cloud and you think you're stuck in this storm and there's no way out. That's where you end up. And you know, I, I think Peter Tia posted an article about a young woman who killed herself and I wrote something in response on social media, something like,

Speaker 4:          00:27:46       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:27:47       that's horrible to see. Especially I think, I think I wrote something along the lines of, hey, that's horrible to see, especially with so many people that are fighting to live. You know, you think about people that have cancer or whatever. And someone wrote back to me,

Speaker 4:          00:28:03       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:28:03       you don't understand mental illness. You know, you don't understand depression. And like, I responded back and I said, and then he kind of said, you know, it's not like that. And I said, you're right. I don't, like, I don't under, I don't, I'm not a psychologist. I don't fully understand what it's like to have this going on. And it's the same thing when we, Chris Cornell from Soundgarden killed himself and I happened to be on Joe Rogan's podcast the next day and we started off the podcast. We were talking about it. And you know, it's the same thing because what Joe Rogan and I are saying, and we're not psychologists, we're saying it's got to be hard to dig out of that, you know, go, go swing a kettle bell, go do something active, which to somebody that's got massive depression that just sounds idiotic, but to, to Joe Rogan and I really get a lot of satisfaction out of swinging kettle bells and doing Jujitsu.

Speaker 1:          00:28:54       It's like, that sounds like a decent idea. Right? It sounds like relief. Yeah. And so, Hey, I, that's, you know, of course you, yeah, I should I caveat that statement with, hey man, I'm not a psychologist. I don't really know when I'd feel like I, when I feel like there's darkness in the world, I really liked to do something physical. Tim Ferriss said the same thing. Get out of your mind, get into your body like the, okay, so the, the, you have those conversations. And you think, this is what I think, I can't change what I think, you know, why this is what I think someone could change my mind if someone could educate me. Sure. But I'm just making a statement. Hey man, that's horrible to see. Yeah. It's horrible to see. Especially when there's people that have cancer or whatever and they're fighting as hard as they can to stay alive and someone else that doesn't have any diseases decides, you know what, I'm going to take my own life.

Speaker 1:          00:29:51       I'm going to kill myself. That's horrible to see that. That's my statement. Yeah. And someone you don't understand this. And I'm like, no, I don't. That's part of my point is no, I don't understand this. And so I, I will say this, I've seen how fragile the mind can be. Yeah. And really why should, I should rephrase that. How fragile the mind is because I've seen people that seem to be going down a good path in, in all of a sudden out of nowhere that path is, they're gone. And, and that's like shocking. So one thing I guess I, the part that I understand is that I don't understand it and it's hard for me to relate to that and it's hard for me to understand and say, wow, I could have seen that common. No, actually I couldn't seem that common at all at all. So the interest, the most interesting thing about this to me is this book is from 1942 and it's talking about the same things that were apparently still discovering right now like that sometimes you need a break from combat like that when you come home you might be a little bit, you might have some nightmares

Speaker 1:          00:31:05       like that. If you break mentally, it doesn't mean that you're a weak link. And Band of brothers does a great job of that. The one character who's a total bad ass through and all of a sudden he just can't take anymore. And they go, okay, no problem. And Dick winters talks about it and he says, yeah, we no one lost any respect for that guy. The guy took his risks, he did a great job, and then he couldn't do it anymore. And David Hackworth describes it as, hey, you people have a cop and the cop gets filled up and we'd filled up. It's filled up. You can't put any more in there. He can't put any more combat in there. And it's not, some people have a bigger cup than other people. It's no disrespect. It's not, it's not a negative statement, it's just that's the way it is.

Speaker 1:          00:31:49       So if someone gets in these bad situations, what in my opinion you have to do is take a break, get someone to help get someone to talk to about it, that can help you find your way out of the store. But that's what I realized from, from the times we've had. Speaking of of Jordan Peterson, the Times that we, for the first time we had him on here, I had never really spent any time thinking about psychology as an actual possible thing in the world. You know what I mean? Just kind of seemed like Voodoo to me. Right. It's, yeah. Yeah. And then when he was talking through some of the psychological protocols that they use to come over particular to overcome particular psychological issues, I was like, oh, okay. So this basically is like a car mechanic, right? You come in with and you've got this problem with your car, cool.

Speaker 1:          00:32:41       This is what we're gonna do to fix that problem with your car. And so there's a certain amount of psychology that was revealed to me from Jordan as like, oh yeah, this is when you have this situation, this is what you do to heal it. And so it's important. I, that was kind of a, that was, uh, that was a revelation to me. Not like a revelation that changed my world, but it was, for me, psychology was just always kind of Voodoo. That's what it seemed like to me. Looking at it from the outside. And I'm an ignorant person, right? Seriously, I'm an, I'm kind of an ignorant person. I, I graduated high school, I grew up in the middle, a, grew up in the military. I spent all my time around a bunch of other knuckleheads like me. It's like you're, you're not talking this vast with this vast experience of all these different data points of the world.

Speaker 1:          00:33:29       It's like, no, I'm just a guy who never really dealt with psychology before. So for me, I just looked at, oh, it's just some weird people laying on a couch. You know what I learned from the movies? And so I didn't see the benefit of, Hey, oh, they actually have identifiable problems that they can see. And then they have protocols to overcome those. So if someone is out there and they're caught in this storm, whatever that storm may be, if you go to one of these brain mechanics, if they would've called it brain mechanic, I would have understood it. Go to a brain mechanical, they're called a psychologist to a brain mechanic and say, hey, this is the problem that I'm having right now. Can you give me a tuneup? And the brains, the brain mechanic will say, Yep, here's the protocol. I want you to do this. I want you to write down this. I want you to talk about this. I want, and that's what they do. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:34:25       Mental Danger Signals back to the book. Mental first aid is just as important as physical first aid for preventing casualties and losses to the service. If a 1942 if a man can be relieved of duty for a time given a rest when he needs it urgently, he can usually be counted upon to come back to the combat presently with fresh zest and vigor. If however, he's allowed to go on past his mental breaking point without let up. If he is permitted to wait until he collapses or until the urgency of his needs makes him go on sick call voluntarily, the chances are much smaller for his rapid recovery checkout world war one shell shock and that's what you end up with. Guys that are mentally destroyed by the horror that they see and the on remitting nonstop presence of this horror you have to give guys breaks if they need it.

Speaker 1:          00:35:24       Next, the first thing to look for is anything that makes a man stand out in an awkward way from the others in his unit. Anything that makes him look odd to the other men marks him as not. Does he stay by himself too much? Does he go for long periods without speaking? Is he known to other men as having strange ideas? Does he find conditions intolerable than other men get along under? All right. Is He a problem in the outfit? Refusing certain foods, wetting the bed following strange or peculiar practices? Does the sergeant regardless, regardless peculiar. Another thing to look for is any sudden change in the soldier's own personality. If he is a man who has been in the outfit for a while, it's easy to, it's easy to note a complete reversal of habits or attitudes when the ordinarily cheerful man becomes moody and depressed.

Speaker 1:          00:36:17       When the quiet orderly soldier becomes boisterous and noisy and a disciplinary problem. When the neat well groomed man becomes dirty and disheveled, let's his shoes going shined his uniform on button his hair and combed. When the dependable mangoes a wall and starts drinking hard, these are signs to look for for mental trouble. They should be looked into. The guard house may not be any help at all. Sometimes it makes things even worse. It's worse. So just because someone starts getting in trouble, hey, you know what? We do film in the brig as not going to make things any better. In fact, it could make things worse. Back to the book when a man has been through a particularly trying experience in combat without relief for a long period under steady bombing or gunfire without protection cutoff from other troops are lost at sea. More cute signs of war nerves may show up.

Speaker 1:          00:37:07       All men should know that these signs are the natural result of fear and war strain. They do not mean that a man has gone insane, but they do mean that he needs care. Rest, medical attention and mental first aid and here's some signs of that. Here's some signs of severe stress, inability to sleep, terrible nightmares in which the battle is repeated over and over, inability to eat, buzzing or humming in his ears, shakiness, general weakness, weakness in certain parts of his body as the knees or the rest of dizziness. Peculiar feelings in the heart, fluttering, pounding, skipping a beat, difficult breathing, relentless combined, but let restlessness combined with a feeling of being penned in an overwhelming desire to push people and walls out of the way. Rest is the principal cure for these indications of Warner's rest and the care of a medical man who understands such cases and an understanding on the part of the soldier of what is wrong with him.

Speaker 1:          00:38:10       These feelings are natural enough for anyone who's gone through the difficult conditions of combat, but they are very frightening to a man who does not expect them even more distressing than the shells or bombs or torpedoes themselves. This is when it's important to understand what's happening. If you don't know why you're shaking, if you don't know why you can't sleep at night, if you don't know why you can't eat, why you feel weak, like there's why there's ringing in your ears. If you don't understand why those things are happening, you, it's going to be worst for you. It's just unexpected. It's unknown and we're afraid of the unknown. Officers who understand these matters can do a great deal to relieve the men's fears of war nerves and to prevent them by their own calm recognition of the fact of nerves and their costs. So hey, officer's like, Hey man, look, you just got you. You've been out here a little too long. We're going give you a little breather.

Speaker 1:          00:39:03       How the mind protects itself. The body has defense mechanisms, so has the mind to touch a piece of hot metal and instantly you have withdrawn your hand before you know what you are doing. If something flies towards your face, you shut your eyes without stopping to decide how to close them. These are natural means for self protection. When the mind is attacked by unpleasant ideas, dangerous fears. It too has a way of withdrawing rough, turning away and shutting out what cannot be endured. When you see a man of ordinary co good common sense become strangely blind to facts. Refuse to believe that his lost brother has really been killed or refuse to see that he's he himself is to blame for a disastrous failure. That man's mind is automatically protecting itself from a truth so bitter that he can't take it

Speaker 1:          00:39:47       little bit delusional. It might be dangerous even where it possible to convince them, convince a man of the actual facts he might if compelled to face them, commit suicide. That has happened more than once and obstinate refusal to accept the truth on the part of a man of ordinary good judgment is a danger signal just as a fever of 103 degrees is a signal of a serious physical danger. Don't try to argue with such a man. He should be given a rest or a furlough from the duty and the strain. It is apparent that the mind is hard hit when he is fit again, he will be able to see clearly once more, he will rate himself and go back to normal just as the fever patient patient does when its temperature goes back down, but it is only when the mind's natural protective mechanism are used to an excessive or unreasonable extent that they, that they, that they point to a sick or exhausted mine.

Speaker 1:          00:40:46       Every normal man uses them daily. To some extent. This is the way they work and it's goes through a bunch of things that we all do on a daily basis. Normal people to deal with things. One, passing the buck. You see this every day when a man fails or or his humiliated, he can shrug it off or freely admit his. It is his own fault. If the failure is trivial, I did not mean much to him or if he has strong character. If the failure is a great personal tragedy, all but the man of an extraordinary strength of character, we'll try to put the blame on someone or someone else, someone or some thing else. The man who thus fails, we'll seize upon any plausible excuse. He blames the weather, the man who gave him wrong advice or the man who got in his way.

Speaker 1:          00:41:45       Sometimes he may even imagine a plot against himself and persuade him that everybody is down on him humiliation and defeat our hard to bear instinctively. Every man wants to try it once to get out from under. When blame hangs over him. Habits of good sportsmanship usually prevent him from doing so, but still in his own mind or among friends, he will say, but it wasn't my fault. That's an amazing section, obviously directly related to the idea of extreme ownership. The fact that it's only a man of extraordinary strength of character who will take the blame. That's the only, that's the only person everyone else is going to. I think what's important about this is to recognize that we all subconsciously know this. So when you screw something up and you go, well, you know, we didn't get the supplies we were supposed to get and that's why we failed. Everybody knows that. That's a little character flaw. You got right there to shine through. That's what's going on, right? It's a little character flaw and you hear it all the time. It's so obvious to everyone when you're making an excuse. Well, it, no one

Speaker 3:          00:43:10       believes your excuse. You don't want, it leaves your excuse. Even if everyone's making an excuse. Yeah, it doesn't matter. It's still the subconscious. Everyone let, let's say me, you, I dunno. Lafe there's a bunch of people in a room and we're all making excuses. It almost seems like each individual guy would be like, oh, they're making excuses. Meanwhile, like they're not thinking, oh, I'm making it uses too. You know? It's a scary thing. And what's cool is

Speaker 1:          00:43:39       as soon as someone goes, hey, you know what? This is actually my fault. Yeah. Other people go, Oh man,

Speaker 3:          00:43:47       I need to say that too, cause I screwed some stuff up. Yeah, it's all, it's kind of like you ever been in like a big meeting and it kind of goes off the rails a little bit. You have. Okay, good. Wait, have you ever been in a big meeting? What was your big meeting with like your wife and your tickets? Believe me, that's a huge meeting. The, and then, you know, let's say it goes off the rails and people start like essentially raising their voice. Maybe not yelling, but you know, and I'll, everyone's talking, you can't hear what anyone's saying. Right. But everyone's voicing their opinions essentially, just, just a little bit more passionately. Right. But you can't hear anybody. What did anyone say? Right? You know that happens a lot, so it's kind of the same concept because even when you are saying anything, everyone else is talking. You're compelled to be like, be quiet, but oh, what you just do it there. You just added to the noise with the thing. Rather than like handling it kind of consciously and be like, okay, I'm not going to add to the noise. I'm going to be quiet.

Speaker 1:          00:44:47       Yes. Taking ownership is contagious and making excuses is contagious. They're both contagious. Yeah. They'll both run ramping wild until you put a check on them. The good thing, the good news about that is taking ownership is the stronger power. So if you, if someone in that group starts to take ownership that that virus will spread stronger than the excuse making virus. Okay. The next thing that people do is the false front. When a man is worried by the fear, perhaps only half consciously, but deep in his heart that he has serious that he has a serious fault or weakness, what does he do? He puts up a great show of being just the opposite sort of person. If the man is stupid or ineffective yet feels a need to be strong and sure he will overdo his efforts to impress people. You will be loud and boisterous and cocky. The timid person may do foolhardy stunts seeking to prove his bravery. The man who is really courageous, strong and manly. Seldom knee feels, any need to demonstrate it. He just takes himself for granted. So there's a bunch of bed, obviously we see this all time. People are insecure about the way they do something. They try and give the false front that they're great at it. I remember when I was young and I bleached my hair blonde did a few times by the way. That's interesting. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:46:21       So it wasn't like super long and I'm like this, but it just shirt and us. I was a girl, he said, hey you, you just do that for attention.

Speaker 5:          00:46:32       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:46:33       And I'm thinking to myself like, well I don't like, I don't do it for attention. You know, and then you thought to yourself more, you know, it kinda sticks with you. Like am I doing it for attention? I'm not realizing it kind of thing. And some fee, you know, you go round and round in your head, you're like, then why did I do it? You know, do it, did I like, like how it specifically looked because it does stand out. I knew that from the beginning. What age is this? Uh, 2020, 20, 21 maybe? Yeah, like 20th. Okay. [inaudible] 97. Yeah, 20. See, anyway, so after you think about it, you're like, yeah, cause you know, I liked how it looked at the time and

Speaker 3:          00:47:18       yeah, I wanted people to sort of look, you know, it was a, so then what did you do? Nothing. Do you, didn't you kept I admitted it to myself. Yeah, I kept it. And then yeah, there's a lot. Uh, there's a lot of wrestlers like the high school wrestlers that do that. There's whole teams, whole teams. Everyone's got their hair bleached blonde. Yeah. Will it, cause there's a level of arrogance which with wrestling. Yeah. Well yeah, like self confidence. Like, Hey, I'm going to going to make this happen. And it's, it's a psychological game, right? I'm not scared of you. Look at me. I'm, I actually bleached blonde, my hair look at me cause I'm about to stick you on the mat. Okay. So other than semantics, is there a difference between the expression I want attention or I'm doing it for attention versus I'm doing it to stand out.

Speaker 3:          00:48:10       I think those are the same thing, but one kind of sounds more like kind of superficial kindness. So you just want attention. Yeah. No I'm doing to stand out. You know, I want to stand out. That's a good thing to stand up. That's a not a great argument is what I'm saying. Being being the, hey I just want to stand out. That's the most positive possible way of saying I just want attention. Yeah, because what you want. Yeah. Cause if you say Elena stand out cause you can um, like try to stand out or pursue standing out as a good thing for a good reason. You know, like I wanna stand out, I want my business to stand out. I don't want my x, Y, z thing to stand out. So, you know, so people don't have no sign on it or whatever. But if you're like, I want to do it for attention, it just sounds like I just want the attention, like if that's what I want, that's the end goal of the attention.

Speaker 3:          00:49:01       That's what it feels like when you say it. Even though there's sort of the same thing. There are the things, I was playing soccer when I was a kid and my dad, my parents were school teachers. Yeah. They're not a lot of money in school teaching and we, my dad, I needed a pair of cleats, so I'm probably eight years old and my dad goes to the sporting good store, digs into the the bin of leftovers second hand whenever any gets. And the pair of cleats that fit me is white. It's a pair of white cleats. Yeah. This is 19 whatever. 78 does. No one with white cleats. This is not for, everyone has black lights. So I go to the soccer game and like I said, I think we through white cleats. Cleats. Yeah, because my dad, they were the cheap, they went in the bargain bin. Right. It wasn't like my dad on the school teacher's salary was like, hey, which pair do you want from this rack over here? No, you're getting the, the new buck. You know what that is? No, it's a fake leather, you know, so you're just getting a fake leather plastic cleats. They're white, whatever. But I was out on the soccer pitch and I think, I want to say I scored a goal I think,

Speaker 1:          00:50:29       and as I was running back, uh, so like a dad from the other team said something like, you know, you think you're the big star now with those white cleats. I don't know if he was being nice. He might've been being nice. It didn't sound like it to me at the time. I think that right there was like the beginning of me thinking, I don't want to be the guy that's dying their hair. A bright blonde at 21 years old. Yeah. When you said maybe 21 you're going to be that. You think you're going to be the big star now he said something with those white cleats. It was something like that. I can't remember very much from my childhood that I remember. Remember when you were playing like the, this is not some big soccer, you know they got kids playing soccer now. They got there looking like a professional soccer.

Speaker 1:          00:51:24       No, this is, you remember them things that you had when you were a little kid. That yellow shirt that was like elastic around the bottom and you just put it on over your other shirt. So it was like the yellow team versus the other team who was one of those things. We're not talking high level, we're not talking to high level soccer playing. We're talking yellow jersey, yellows against the regular kids. Intermural. So there I was with the white cleats on and I remember thinking that guy thinks that I'm trying to make a spectacle out of myself. And he didn't say nice goal. He said, oh you think you got some Nice cleats? Were you celebrating all hard or something or you know, running thing. I was running back. Yeah. Yeah. He was hating. I'm trying to think of when I celebrated hard cause that's something that, that's something I remember a couple of times in my life celebrating hard and being like, man that was a bad move.

Speaker 1:          00:52:17       And again, it's probably the same age group, you know, like yeah, it's weird man. That's, that's kind of deep though. Were where that the, cause it's the opposing team's debt or somebody on their feelings. Um, cause yeah, I wonder right, because there's two things that he couldn't be, he was hating regardless and he was a mad, you know, goal obviously. But was he like, oh you think you're the big shot now? Like hating on, that's what I heard. You're cool. Or was he hating like on a deeper level where he was like, oh you think you're a big shot? Oh, but look here kind of thing. Was he saying that the way I interpreted it was he was saying, you think you're special because you've got those white cleats on. He didn't know that. Then we're the only place I got her. Cause my dad's a notoriously cheap guy. My Dad, we could tell stories about my dad. All, all 10, 15 podcasts worth of penny pinching come up from the old man. So you weren't getting these normal cleats. These are bargain bin cleats. So that's what we're talking about. Yes sir.

Speaker 1:          00:53:21       Number three, taking it out on the dog. The man who suffered injury and is not strong enough to hit back. May literally take it out on the dog or may go around looking for trouble with someone else. He can talk back to a punch in the, in the nose. Yeah, check. Here's one borrowed virtue. A more constructive or helpful sort of mental protection mechanism is this action of a man who feels weak or inadequate by himself and who gains a feeling of strength and superiority by attaching themselves to a stronger man or a strong group. It was this that sent so many men to their recruiting stations on the morning after Pearl Harbor. As a man alone, you feel powerless in the face of threatening dangers as United States soldier. You know, you can go anywhere in the world, avenge wrongs, and protect your treasured way of life.

Speaker 1:          00:54:13       So if there's a positive way that we, we we roll. Number five is sick call. When your mind is called upon to face something you dread terribly, your body may come, come promptly to your rescue. The aviation student who really dreads to go up for his first solo feeling, sure he is going to crack up his plane may develop a convenient but real headache on that day. He, yeah, you see that happen, right? And a little feel good. You speed. It happened with little kids to first Jiu Jitsu tournament. He'd come sick first. Whatever you know, first basketball game, I'm feel good. Shut up. You feel fine moving on the war within the man. It might be much easier to defeat the enemy if men could only win in some way. The conflicts that very often going go on within themselves.

Speaker 1:          00:55:17       A man. So this is, this is where we go dichotomy. The new level of dichotomy be digging in right here. A man so often wants to do two opposite things at the same time and he wants desperately to do both. He wants to dominate other men and yet be liked by them. He wants to give vent to his anger, but he doesn't want to get in hot water. He wants to gain promotion, but it doesn't want to do all the hard work. Above all, he wants to be a brave and treat true soldier to keep the soldiers faith, and yet he wants to live how to be brave and safe. That is the greatest psychological problem for the soldier. Most of the war neurosis, mental illness in parentheses, result from the failure of men to find any sort of satisfactory way out of that dilemma.

Speaker 1:          00:56:11       Every man is equipped with two kinds of the deep seated desires or instincts. Often these two conflict, one set has to do with his relations with other men. He wants to be one of the gang appreciated and admired by others and he even likes to sacrifice himself for the good of the group to which he belongs, whether it is his family, church, army, or nation, but he also has another set of desires that cannot ever be entirely denied desires connected with himself. His life has comfort, his personal freedom. No amount of patriotic fervor can wholly kill or drown out the calls of the more personal instincts. Only a few rush to enlist with no misgivings. Most for most men, there is some concern or distress in making the decision to leave home, family and job in order to join the service of the country. A move to a war theater and an advanced to close contact with the enemy usually brings a crisis in the battle within the soldier as well as in the battle against the enemy.

Speaker 1:          00:57:21       When a man finds himself close indeed to death, that his instinct to self preservation, one of the most powerful urges every normal man has makes every fiber of his being protested against facing the danger. Yet his comrades, his officer's his country, are all counting on him to do his bit a pretty big bit, risking his own life. Yet they are counting on him. If the personal instincts, when the struggle, the man, when contact with the enemy forces is made, we'll run away or will surrender. If the social instincts prevail, then he is the stuff of which all good soldiers, all heroes are made. Most men who have traveled the hard path of army life up to the front lines put up a good fight once they get there for a few. So there you go. You either have guys that go, okay, you know what?

Speaker 1:          00:58:15       Of course I want to stay alive, but I'm going to be loyalty to my country, my army, my team that I'm with and the guy to my left and my right. And so guess what? I'm going forward into the fray. The other that, that make the other decision arc. Well, you know what? I want to stay alive so I'm gonna run away. So there's two distinct types of behaviors. Most of the time it's, hey, we're gonna put up the good fight. Occasionally it's a coward and then this is the interesting one for a few. However, this struggle ends in a stalemate, a compromise. That is what a war neurosis is. A compromise of this internal conflict. If a man goes on being torn by as conflicting desires, if he cannot bring himself to go forward yet is to conscientious to give up, he will suffer from the type of neurosis characterized by anxiety he finds he can no longer concentrate.

Speaker 1:          00:59:05       He becomes confused. The expression on his face, his pulse rate and his rapid breathing betray the fierce battle going on with him within him. He himself may not be fully aware of the cause of this terrible sense of fear and horror of it seems to hang over him. Yet he is in a way solving his problem. He is making himself too inefficient to continue to fight, yet giving himself so much suffering that is conscious cannot accuse him of taking the easy way out yet even so, he does not know that he is doing all this. His nervous system does it for him. The man who suffers in any of these ways is not to be blamed. He's not a coward. If he were, he would have no conflict. That's an interesting point, so if you're just a coward, you just like, screw it, I'm out of here.

Speaker 1:          00:59:50       But the guy that freezes up and to get so nervous he doesn't want to run, but he doesn't want to go fight. He can't solve that conflict in his head. Back to the book. If he were, he would have no conflict. He would see to it that he was not at the front but in a soft, safe job somewhere at a good distance in if necessary he would dessert, but he does not dessert and still does not fight. He compromises with a difficult, unpleasant alternative one which he does not choose, but which has nervous system chooses for him. He cannot control it. The leader who lectures him balls amount or punish as him for neglect of duty is only to increase his trouble. On the other hand, coddling such men is a mistake too, so you can't go to, you got to balance this. You can't go super hard on them, but you can't coddle them either.

Speaker 1:          01:00:41       You need to balance this dichotomy. What they need is understanding, help the reinsurer, reassurance that comes from a firm but friendly attitude on the part of those who deal with them. They need the encouragement of assurance that such things happen to the best of men, but that men may get over such difficulties with aid. They need to be told that they will be helped by a good night's sleep, perhaps drug induced by the medical officer by a good meal and by rest and that then they will be expected to return the f to the fight and do their duty with the others.

Speaker 1:          01:01:16       So that's a pretty interesting way of looking at it. And I would say, as I thought about that, think about how many, how much, how much nervousness you feel. If you think about the nervousness is actually it's an internal war between two decisions that you could be making, right? Yeah. What should I do? Should I buy this new car or save the money, right? Like, well, which one should I do? I really want the car. But I know it should save money. You get this little internal internal conflict and that's what the struggle is. You're not really actually nervous about buying the new car and you're not nervous and I'll save money. Your nerve, you can't make a decision based on the two things that you want to make happen. So we get those little, I think it's, if you, if you frame things up, if you're feeling stressed about something, if you frame up what is actually stressing you out, there's a good chance of what's actually stressing you out is you're just trying to figure out which decision to make. Yeah, yeah. That is true. And one thing that you can do is you can, if you play your card, if your brain plays the game out, you can be so you can

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       not make a decision. Oh yeah. Because hey, you're just not making a decision. It's like that. It's crazy how they, I mean that's the first I've heard anyone articulate that little bit. Cause Bro, I'll get that in the most like stupid mundane things. So okay. Bear with me some with some unloading unloading the dishwasher. So on this side of my kitchen, which is like, it's kind of a longer like kind of kitchen where, so on this side, this is where pots go the, but it's not just positive to pots and then certain kinds of little these little soy sauce dishes. And, and then on this side it's like silverware and then there's like plates, right? So I'm unloading the dishwasher and I'm trying to be efficient. I'm not rushing, but I'm trying to be efficient. So I'm grabbing, I have like, you know, I get like maybe four dishes of sorts at a time.

Speaker 3:          01:03:13       And so, but I look at what I grabbed and I get this feeling like, shoot, where do I go? Do I go here first? You know, and put away the pots first that I have in my hand or doing over here. Because if I go over here, I can do that, you know, kind of thing. And I'm at this little conundrum, but I'm like, you know what I should do, and this is all just going on in my head. It takes maybe like four or five seconds, but it seems kind of long. But I don't want her, you ain't making videos during their debate yourself about pots and pans and glasses and soy sauce dishes. Who has a soy sauce dish? Is that an actual thing bro? It's bad because this is Lee. I'm not exaggerating. This literally goes into my head and it's this micro little almost anxiety.

Speaker 3:          01:03:57       This is not exact, but it's like it's there. It's something. It's not like nothing, you know? I'm not just like, oh, just making, taking action. I'm not doing that. I'm like literally standing there not doing anything, thinking about this stuff. So I'm like, okay, why have not in a situation where you have to make actual decisions, boom, that would be a problem. If this is any indicator, it will be a problem. So I'm looking and I'm like, shoot, where should I go straight to the that I said, no, you know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna put, put this whole site. Is this the dishes that go on this side? Because I'm going to put those back home to grab stuff. They've all gone that tight. But wait, now I've got to take the time to put this back in, searching and grab other ones.

Speaker 3:          01:04:33       I'm losing time. That's less efficient given the point that I'm at right now. So I'm like, man. And then you know, and then of course I'll just be like, yeah, whatever. I'll just kind of go. But the point is, Brad, that happens is it literally happens if it happening happening to you. Echo Charles with the dishes. Yeah. I can imagine that other people feel it when there's actual decisions to be made. And just to wrap this whole thing up, and I don't want to talk about that anymore ever. But if you were smart, you would just organize your kitchen so that everything is located co located. All things that go from dishwasher go into this small area. So think about that one. Well, don't think about it for too long because I don't want you to freaking stress out anxiety, but that a lot of those like he that he puts it in terms of like a two time kinds of instincts, right?

Speaker 3:          01:05:24       Yeah. What social and we're social human survival. Yeah. It's like a big one is a way to see it. It's like how you pointed out to me like the long game, you know it's like either you're playing the short game, the long game. So it's kind of like that. Like there's like you, you had the example of the buying the car thing. That's the short term versus long term payoffs situation. Most things are when you have that little conundrum, you know, like you, I'm gonna eat this pot of brown or at least pan of brownies, but I want to eat those products because they're delicious but I don't want to get, you know, you know, put on weight or whatever. You know, it's kind of the same thing I want both kind of thing. But, and they most of the time I think anyway, it sorts itself out to be a short term versus long term struggle.

Speaker 3:          01:06:04       And I think the important thing here is that you can actually take this concept and apply it to meaningful decisions that human beings have to make. Not just soy sauce bowls and brownies. No Diet is a big one day. It is. It's not a big one. When you compare it to storming the beaches of you. Oh, Jima. Just saying I agree with that. Yes sir. And speaking of which, and this is where this is obviously, this is part here, is probably written more directed at you back to the book. Men differ greatly in their abilities to stand up under this internal personal conflicts. Most men can come successfully through terrorizing experiences, revolting scenes and exposure to it.

Speaker 1:          01:06:46       Def War is older than history in all nations and tribes have resorted to it. So

Speaker 3:          01:06:52       even the terrorizing experience that you have. Yeah, with the soy sauce bowls. Oh, that one's garden. That's rough.

Speaker 1:          01:07:04       Continuing. The average soldier has conflicts, but settles them himself with no one else the wiser. So he finds himself free to fight with his whole strength on him. The average free soldier victory depends. Fortunately, the first contact with the enemy is the hardest in seasons. Troops, internal conflict diminishes. They have faced the worst and no, it is not intolerable. Even soldiers who have to retreat or not defeated. If they have learned to conquer their own fears, that's a good one. Even soldiers who have to retreat or not defeated, if they have learned to conquer their own fears, they will advanced another time. Having once won the fight with the inner man and having faced the reality of battle, finding it, finding it less terror and more opportunity for success than the green recruit could ever have believed possible.

Speaker 4:          01:08:05       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:08:06       So now we get to this section in the book and like I said, this is the second that I actually wanted to cover, but we ended up covering this whole on over the course of three podcasts. And this section is called leadership. You can't boss a brick, you can't even boss a dog unless the dog has been trained to obey and has formed habits of responding to commands. And before you can boss him, you must know what commands you will spawn to the famous seeing eye dogs can do wonderful things to aid the blind. But both dog and master must first go through a period of training. So there you go.

Speaker 2:          01:08:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:47       And now we get this off. 40 is not power.

Speaker 2:          01:08:52       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:08:53       that's an epic statement. Listen to this. No amount of legal authority over the grizzly bears of British Columbia would enable you to get yourself obeyed by them out in the woods. Men can be commanded only after they have acquired habits of obeying after and after. Their leader has learned to give them commands that make these habits work. All successful leadership dust depends on the habits of those who are to be led. The officer's standing before his men is limited in the direct exercise of his authority by what the troops are able to get through their eyes and ears. So this is this interesting you're going to see in this opening section here. It's really leaning towards that traditional military id of leadership. It's like, look, if you're trained correctly and I give you an order, you're going to listen. And so that's, that's where this thing kind of starts off with.

Speaker 1:          01:09:46       And as you probably can figure out, that's contrary to to what I believe effective leadership to consist of. But it's talking about it. And even though I don't believe that's the most effective form of leadership. And a matter of fact, I know it's not the most effective form of leadership. That being said, it is a form of leadership and it is, it can be effective. It does work in many situations where it's like, look, I'm the boss, I'm the one that's right. The paychecks, I'm the one that's got the rank and when I tell you to do something, you know you're going to get it done. And that is a normal sort of baseline, rudimentary,

Speaker 2:          01:10:26       okay

Speaker 1:          01:10:26       form of leadership. So it does exist. Back to the book, when a 40 is not obeyed, the fault may lie in the manner of speech of the leader or else it may be that the men are, are in need of basic training. So it looks so you look, if people aren't listening to you, it could be the, the way that you're talking to them. And now it starts to, and the reason I said this is starting off talking about type of leadership that I don't really find to be optimum at all. But you're going to see that it starts to lead towards the type of leadership that I do believe to be effective and they actually believe it to be the most effective too. So continue on. It is often said that a good leader knows how to handle his men actually. However, it is not possible for any leader to handle his men.

Speaker 5:          01:11:13       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:11:13       It is

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       himself that he handles. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:11:17       Then the men react to his department and the way in which they react to pens in term on their habits of thought and action. So that's a great statement of being the leader. It's it's you don't handle your men, you handle yourself. You're the one that you need to handle. And then if you handle yourself correctly, the team will then react to the way that you handle yourself. So that now we're starting to lean towards what I believe to be good leadership. That's leading by example. Next section. Discipline in an army. Much of this training on which leadership depends is established by discipline. Discipline is training in the habits of attention and obedience. Without such habits, we might have a crowd or a mob, but not an army. It is quite possible to lead a mob. Yet such leadership is uncertain depending largely on the accidents of personal appearance and unfortunate timing in an army. However, there have been many leaders of many ranks and they have been interchangeable.

Speaker 5:          01:12:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:12:23       If a leader is killed, another must be ready to take his place and lead men.

Speaker 1:          01:12:29       So it's talking about discipline and this is talking about the traditional form of military discipline. Hey, there's a rank structure. You must be obedient and that is not the optimal type of discipline that I believe in, which is, hey, we are a discipline team. We have discipline, standard operating procedures. We understand what the mission is, we understand what the goals are. We are going to move in that direction with discipline and the discipline is not imposed. Discipline that I impose on my team, it's disciplined that they impose on themselves because they realize that it makes them more effective and more efficient and more likely to be able to accomplish the mission which they believe in. Now it talks a little bit about learning obedience.

Speaker 5:          01:13:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:13:19       And again, obedience to me is not something that I'm looking for for my team. It's not what I'm looking for. I'm not looking for obedience. I'm looking for people that know how to understand what the goal is and they're going to move towards the goal.

Speaker 5:          01:13:31       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:13:33       The first requisite of command is attention. So you got to get people to pay attention to you. That makes sense. What men do invariably and repeatedly is finally drilled into them, becomes for them. Second Nature, they learned to perform acts or maneuvers and response to commands or orders. Because the commando order has always been accompanied by the act and the act by the command. Mere lecturing never trains men in action. At best, it makes them learn mere words sequences, except when the listeners already know enough about the required action to perform it. An imagination learning new, in other words, requires participation. You don't learn to swim by taking a correspondence course. So yes, you have to drill people. You have to get it, make it second nature that that is true. And we do that in, we did that in the seal teams. They do that in the military.

Speaker 1:          01:14:24       People know what they're gonna do when they get shot at. They know what the, from a certain direction, everyone knows what they're gonna do and we drill it over and over and over again until you don't have to think about it. It's second nature. Unfortunately, bad habits as well as good can be learned. If on spoken command, men do not respond, then they are learning not to respond. Whenever they are ordered to do something they cannot do. They are learning to disobey military manuals. Embody this fact in a rule. Never give a command that you do not expect to be obeyed. Now that's a brilliant statement and I don't necessarily think it's a brilliant statement for the same reasons, but actually pretty close. If you wait, if, if I'm looking at you and you're working for me and I say, yeah, you need to get all this stuff move by by noon today and I know there's no physical way for you to do it, I'm wasting it.

Speaker 1:          01:15:18       And, um, um, I'm diminishing my authority over you because you're thinking, no, there's no way I can do that. So now you're definitely not going to do it. And the next time I say to get something done, you've got to, you've got to already a preconceived notion that you don't really have to do it. So that's a great statement. If you're in charge, never give a command that you don't expect to be obeyed. Don't do it. Keep your mouth shut. Figured out something that can be done. Thus, a young leader when he finds himself so situated that his command might be disregarded, must refrain from giving it. He must first tried to change the situation, capture the attention. He must merely wait until he is reasonably certain that when he gives us the order, it will indeed be obeyed.

Speaker 1:          01:16:05       So it makes sense. And now we get into the section called the leader. And this is now where we start to come towards the vision of leadership or the, the principles of leadership that I believe in back to the book. A good leader does not depend solely on the authority that discipline gives him. As an officer or noncommissioned officer for good leadership goes far beyond discipline. Look, good experience leader inspires respect, confidence, and loyalty in his subordinates, all of which enable him to get from his men performance far above what a new leader could command. So there you go. All this stuff that we just talked about, you've got to train them. You got to have discipline. You've got to make sure they're going to obey your orders. You got to teach him obedience. All that stuff is nothing compared to the power of respect of loyalty.

Speaker 1:          01:17:04       Continuing on in this, the leader can rely on the generous of his men. For men have a natural longing to respect and have affection for their leaders. They want to be proud of their officers and noncommissioned officers just as they want to be proud of their unit and their branch of service. When the, when the new army was first being formed, many of the officers had little experience in command. They had learned the words were capable of giving directions and instructions, but they had learned neither the action nor the manner that go with the command. A young officer would utter an order, but his manner would betray his lack of confidence. This uncertainty was in effect a signal for not carrying the order out promptly and effectively. As military orders must be carried out all our lives, we have depended on the manor and behavior of others as well as on their speech to know what is in their minds.

Speaker 1:          01:18:01       Army discipline cannot change human nature. What did Sarah Armstrong say that 70% of conveyed message in a conversation is from like nonverbal, nonverbal cues. That's massive. Yeah. I wonder if that includes like tone or not. I don't think it does. Technically wouldn't cause that's a verbal cue. Yeah, so we know that whatever the number is, it's a massive amount to a massive amount that is conveyed by what your posture is, what your delivery looks like, what you're counting, it's reads all those things and then it lets include tone in it, right? Which the tone should be in there somewhere. If you're giving orders and you look like you don't know what you're doing and your sound like you don't know you're doing and you're using a tone that sounds like you don't know what you're doing, you're not going to get a lot of jumping in there to execute what you're telling me.

Speaker 3:          01:19:00       Yeah. Pie. That is nuts. Because when you think about it, I mean even saying that you start to think about what at what, like all the little things, all of them that you're doing while you're saying something or trying to say something like even blinking, like even if you blinked one time versus 10 times, just blinking that teeny, teeny, tiny thing when you said, you know, like Bruh, it's like you're saying something completely different. Even if, yeah. Even though like when I'm talking to people, I will not blink. I, yeah. I noticed that very, very early on in our relationship that you don't really blame when you're talking, but I will look, I [inaudible] the weird thing is is I'm not consciously doing that kind of thing. Yeah. But I do know that it's happening. Yeah. And Man, when I, when I first started making videos, I noticed it a lot.

Speaker 3:          01:19:48       So you know, cause I noticed like villains and characters, certain types, quote unquote types of characters. So one a villain. When an actor is playing a villain and he's saying something that's evil or whatever and he's blinking Brah I don't buy it at all. It's the fact you kind of can't really buy it. But if they're saying something, what if it's important in whatever way and they're not blinking. It's almost like, man, that alone sells it so much. Just that alone. Of course there's other stuff, but like, yeah, what? Blinking. Even like wrinkling your forehead kind of thing. Like all these little things. So it goes so deep that you know you can take two people. One guy does hand motions all the time and he just, he moves his hands a lot when he talks and the other guy does the exact opposite. He moves his hands so little that it's noticeable.

Speaker 3:          01:20:33       It's not that, oh he lacks verbal communication. It's his INAC. It's that his inaction is his verbal communication. See what I'm saying? So it's not like he has less verbal communication than the guy who uses his hands. He has just as much, he's just saying something completely different because he's still, see what I'm saying? So it's like just all these nonverbal things that's deep pecos man. Yeah. And this is where self awareness, this is where role playing and most important cause, cause look, you're not gonna, you're not going to become an academy award winning actor. So what you actually need to do is believe in what you're saying. Yeah. That's what you need to do. Because if you don't believe in what you're saying, your troops are looking at you again, he doesn't even believe this. Why am I going to go charge this machine gun nest when this guy doesn't even believe that he should be charged in this machine gun nest.

Speaker 3:          01:21:26       And yet if you truly believe that this is what should go down, people will see that you believe it and they're going to follow. Yeah. So how you feel about this? Because it might be slightly separate. Okay. So you know how people, they'll give you the advice you want to, you want to act confident. You want to be confident when you do this stuff, even if you're not confident or whatever. So it's kind of like people can smell when you're not confident and you're acting confidence. They way they can smell it when you're trying to act casual or an actory lack per how I can see, you know, everyone can see that, but if you do it enough, doesn't it start? Don't you get kind of good at it? That's the advice that I give people isn't go be confident when you talk to people.

Speaker 3:          01:22:09       What I say is when you talk to people, make sure you know what you're talking about. Yeah. Because if you know what you're talking about, you will come across as confident. Why will you come across as confident? Because you are confident now. Sure. There's some people that have some natural ability to act confident even when they're not. Yes, and there's also some people that can be very convincing and telling people to do something that they don't actually believe it. That's very rare. It's very rare. And even if I feel like those people, and obviously I don't know cause I don't know the people, but it seemed like those are the people, they're just used to doing it. They're used to telling tall tales with complete confidence, but you can see how people, if they repeat repeatedly talk about the same thing. Certainly they get better at it. And can they take that too far where they're just turning into a robot that's up there reciting something that they've heard and people go, oh this guy just got this memorized. Cause that's jacked up too, right? Like if you just go, oh, this guy's

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       just memorize this thing and he's not really into it. Right. That's not a good sign either. Yeah. People can see through that. Yeah. If he, yeah. If it's like, yeah man, u fan manufactured enthusiasm or something like that. Yeah. If they can smell it for sure. But because some people like they'll memorize it. Let's say if it's a speed, obviously depends on the context. Totally. But you know, if it's a speech or a lecture or a presentation that somebody get giving that they always give and you know when they talk about this Xyz exciting part or you know, important part, they've done it literally 10,000 times. So they're not going to convey natural excitement. They have to sort of manufacture it for the crowd kind of thing. And Yeah, if that, you know, manufactured excitement comes off as manufacturer to the cards yet that'll jam yet Jim, your whole thing up. Yeah. And I think that's why you have to be talking about something that you know about his part one and part two, you have to be talking about something that you care about. If we don't care about you don't want to hear me stand up and talk about something, you know, some whatever. You don't want it. You don't want to hear me talk about candle making sure. Right. Cause I don't care about candle making. In fact, I don't really like candles.

Speaker 1:          01:24:28       All right. I'm just being honest here. I respect your opinion. Don't like candles. Why would you have candles? It's 2019 right? Right. Well, there's many different reasons for Kendall's. But yeah, mood lighting. Uh, you know, my point is I don't like candles. You don't wanna hear me talk about candles. You don't hear me talk about the construction of candles because I don't care about it and I'm not going to give a very passionate talk about candles. Even if I studied the subject matter. If you hear me talking about leadership, you can't harness the enthusiasm that I have for talking about leadership. You can't, you can't hold it back. It's coming out unbridled. It's unbridled. It's coming out because I really care about this. You know what I'm talking to a bunch of people that are leaders. I want them to win. I want them to learn.

Speaker 1:          01:25:19       I want them to absorb what I'm saying cause I know it can be helpful to them cause I've seen it be helpful to thousands of people. So I want them to get the message and so it's going to come out that way. So I know what I'm talking about. I believe what I'm talking about, what I am talking about and I care about what I am talking about. And if you're talking to people, try and talk about things that you know about, that you care about and that you believe in. And if you do that as a leader, when you're giving direction and its direction that you believe in its direction, that you care about the outcome and its direction that you know and understand you are going to come across like a confident leader and people are gonna listen to you. If you're failing in those categories, it's going to be harder for you.

Speaker 1:          01:26:10       This is interesting continuing on and we just went on a little riff right there. But a leader is actually giving conflicting orders if he is uncertain manner, hints that he does not expect obedience or that he thinks he may not be obeyed. So even if you stand up and you say it you, you can be give conflicting orders if you just don't, if you just look like you're unsure of what you're doing, although it is possible for the new leader who has lacked experience to imitate the manner and tone of wiser leaders around him, only practice in command develops the appropriate manner and tone. And I would go further to say it's not just about practice and you don't want to become a good actor. What you want to do is you want to believe in what you're saying. You want to care about what you think would have no, no, but what you're saying next, lack of a confident manner inevitably interferes with command. So also ma'am, manner that portrays indecision for men respond to the signs of indecision by withholding or delaying action. The rule is that a leader should make up his mind and arrive at that decision before he gives orders.

Speaker 5:          01:27:16       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:27:17       Very obvious, but not so obvious because people screw it up when he confronts his man. He must be ready to commit himself to this course or that men will accept assurance for competence and they do not want competence and they do want competence and leader. Now I, this is again, this is a situation where I men will accept assurance for competence. That's not readily true because just because you're, if you're sure of yourself, the only way you're going to be sure of yourself is if you are competent. Unless you're one of these small fractions of people that are conmen, right? Con Man that can be late, the swollen gonna do everyone like that's you're a con man. If you're really good at that, it can be aligned to people and telling them something that you don't believe in, fine. It'll work. Sometimes if you're great at it might work more often than that. If you're a normal person and you want to be a really good leader, you shouldn't be just using your confidence to overcome the fact that you're don't believe in what you're doing and it's going to be really hard to do. That is really hard to get. People have really good lie detectors in their minds. Hmm.

Speaker 5:          01:28:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:28:26       This is a great section. What soldiers think of leaders for the first time in the history of armies. The army of the United States has undertaken to find out what its enlisted personnel. Think about a large number of things important to the army. Some thousands of soldiers have been interviewed at length and one of the subjects about which they were questioned his army leadership, what the soldiers said makes it very clear that the quality of leadership in an army is the most important single determiner of morale and performance. Did everyone just hear that? What soldiers said makes it very clear that the quality of leadership in an army is the most important single determiner of morale and performance.

Speaker 4:          01:29:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:29:13       What do we say now at echelon front, we say leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield. I luckily don't have to pay the writer of this book to say that cause that's the same thing. Leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield is the single most important determinant of morale and performance. Continuing on the relationship between men and officers, commissioned and noncommissioned determines the fighting spirit of an army quite as much as the ability of the soldiers to take training does. In fact, it turns out that these human relations are much more important to morale than beef, steak, warm socks, ballgames, and Vaudeville shows or what the men believe about the war.

Speaker 1:          01:30:04       What they think. The relationship that you have with your people is more important than all these other things. It's more important than their actual belief in what they're doing. More important than their belief in the war. Continue on among the hundred and 50 so items covered in in, in, in the interview. 77 proof to be definitely associated with morale and of the 20 most closely related to morale. 16 have to do with man to officer relations, what the men think of their leaders is then of utmost importance to the army and to the successful prosecution of the war. Roughly in order of their association with good leadership in the minds of the enlisted men are the following points. Three, here's what makes a good leader one ability. Competence comes first. The good officer must know his stuff for on this depends the confidence in his leadership.

Speaker 4:          01:31:05       Boom

Speaker 1:          01:31:08       and interestingly that is proof of what I just said, that if you don't believe in what you're doing, you don't know what you're doing, everyone's going to sense it. So competence number one. Number two next to the ability next to ability is interested in the welfare of the soldier. The officer who can be trusted to help the soldier in time of need or who would be accessible for personal advice is a good officer. So you've gotta, you gotta be caring about your men. Number three, promptness in making decisions is next. Number four, good teacher or instructor follows the leader who has the patience and the ability to make things clear, to get men under him. Dope. To get to make things clear to the men under him is valued for that reason. So you've got gotta be good teacher. Number five, judgment, common sense, and the ability to get things done, follow in next judgment and common sense. Isn't it an interesting common sense? You know what we want, even once you have some common sense and that horribly, a cliched saying of common sense sometimes isn't very common. And it's a cliche because it's true. Yes.

Speaker 3:          01:32:28       How many times I've been sitting in a big meeting, you know what I mean? Here in the city

Speaker 1:          01:32:33       thing that was so obvious. So it's just such common sense. And had people

Speaker 3:          01:32:40       kind of jaw drop at this amazing statement, which was completely obvious cause sometimes common sense isn't too common. It's only common to you. It's like relative, you know? That's why it's never like an shouldn't say never, but it's not that good of an an idea generally threatened to be like it's Commons or MB like mad at someone for not knowing quote unquote common sense. No, it's not good and it's not good when you,

Speaker 1:          01:33:05       when you make a statement that is common sense to say it condescendingly

Speaker 3:          01:33:10       like this is just common sense. Everyone you need to do this and then everyone already is mad at you. They're resentful of you yet just from the tone alone, the tone alone. Then on top of that dimension you've got your arms crossed and you're shaking hand Sarah Armstrong verbal cue cues. Just, yeah, Mensa because common sense in California is different than common sense in Texas. Some of it possibly. Oh yeah. Yeah. Common Sense in Texas is different than California. I'll tell you. It's true. That's a good point. You are correct. So you can, yeah, the number's going to be on you when you start doing that stuff. The condescending deal.

Speaker 1:          01:33:49       Here we go. Number six, the good leader does not boss you around when there is no good reason for it. Soldiers dislike an officer who throws his rank around, who test his own authority continually. They sense that he is not sure of himself.

Speaker 1:          01:34:08       Let that one sink in. If you're bossing people around using your rank to make things happen, you're people don't like you. Yeah. And there's someone that says, I'm not here for my people to like you like me. You're wrong. If your people don't like you, they will not perform as well as people that do like you. And you're the leader. Number seven, the man who tells you when you have done a good job rates well as a good leader. Failure in commendation is a common complaint among men in the ranks. The best incentive to good work is the prospect that it will be noticed and remembered by the leader

Speaker 1:          01:34:45       solid next. And um, that's something I don't do a lot of. I'm not like, okay, good job buddy. But I will say that when I do tell someone they did a good job, they know that I mean it. They're usually pretty fired up that I said it to him. Yeah, I would agree with that. Number Eight, physical strength and good build. Come next. You're nodding your head over there. Echo Charles. I Agree Jack. I mean, okay so at risk of sounding like maybe disparaging any one in particular, any type person in particular, but I'm just saying this is like factually so you ever watch it like a self defense video? Yes. And no matter what, yes I fall a mic go Joe life LR and Joe Rogan repost those mic Dojo life things. But yeah, there's all kinds of weird self defense things and I know where you're going with this.

Speaker 1:          01:35:46       Yes. So physical self defense guy, he doesn't look like he could what? Make it up a flight of stairs and you're thinking, Bro, I'm not going to listen to anything that you say. Right. Which detective Lee, his physique does not prove the effectiveness of his, his tenant is true. It doesn't. But what about when he's got the sign hanging up in the background that says honor, strength and discipline and only discipline. He has put in putting away that quarter pounders with cheese daily and that that's, that's the point, you know, so it's like bright. It is something, and I, again, I don't want to disparage anyone system or whatever, but yeah man, if I'm a soldier or a listener or a follower and I'm going to do first impression, right? I come up to you and you're going to teach me something and you're like, oh sloppy, you're a sloppy person.

Speaker 1:          01:36:33       I'll tell you. That's at the very least, that's a strike against. There's no doubt about it. And they're just just even me and Ramadi and telling all my guys, hey you will wear a square to wear uniform because first impressions mean something. And so if somebody shows up to be in charge of you and they can't take charge of their own health, it's an indicator that maybe they got some other issues. Especially, I mean then this is clearly directed at people that are in the military because military is a physical job. Re pretty much, regardless of what you're doing in the military, you have to have some physical capability to put on a rucksack and go and walk for a long period of time. You've gotta be able to do these certain physical activities. And if it's apparent from looking at you that you can't do that, respect is going down.

Speaker 1:          01:37:16       And by the way, this isn't, this isn't me talking, this isn't you talking. This is what these thousands of soldiers that filled out this survey said, hey, physical strength and good build, come next. That's what's respected. And it's definitely not mandatory because I mean, Napoleon was like a tiny guy, right? So it's not a mandatory thing, but don't be out of shape. I can tell you that. Yeah, get in shape. Hey, get in shape. How's that? If you're not in shape, get in shape. It'll be better for you as a leader. It will be better for you as a human being it. It'll help everything that you're doing. So do it. Number nine, good education, sense of humor and guts or courage. Number 10 impartiality is next. Leaders who do not save the dirty jobs for fellows. They don't like our valued. The good leader is fair to all in his command, so be fair.

Speaker 1:          01:38:14       Common Sense, which I guess isn't too net next and an importance is industry leaders who do as little work as they can get away with are not respected by the enlisted men. Yeah, don't be standing around with your hands in your pockets cause to home do that. 12 when an officer gives orders in such a way that you clearly know what to do is a mark of merit as a leader. Soldiers also like an officer with a clear strong voice. There you go. That makes sense. The remaining qualities which the soldiers mentioned came toward the bottom of the list. They are undoubtedly related to good leadership but they are less important. Not Hot tempered. Do not drive you too hard. Keep promises. The kind of fellows you could have a good time with, not too proud of their rank are all characteristics which some men want in their leaders, but there is no general agreement about them.

Speaker 1:          01:39:22       Many leaders are considered good in spite of failures on these parts. The chief things a man wants from a leader are thus competence and interest in his welfare. The orders of a man who does not know his stuff cannot be dependent on, they are subject to change and countermand an incompetent leader teaches caution and hesitation and following his lead, he becomes a signal for lack of action on the part of the soldier. Indecision in a leader has the same effect on a soldier as ignorance has no soldier can follow. A leader who's uncertain, which way to turn the essential quality of any leaders to take lead and show the direction quickly, clearly, emphatically, and with enthusiasm. Without these qualities, a man is not even a good leader for his hunting dog. Now the interesting thing about that is there's a, there's a little dichotomy that reveals itself.

Speaker 1:          01:40:18       It's like, okay, you gotta be decisive and give direction quickly, clearly and emphatically that that's great. That sounds good. What happens if you're not sure what happens if you're truly not sure which direction to go? Then what you do is you say hold up former perimeter where we got to get a resection on the map. That is so much better than saying, all right, well we're going to push a little further. You know what I mean? Like I'm not really sure where we are and hold on and wait. If you just go, hey look, we're a little turned around right now. We're need to recouple resections where to check the GPS, whatever we're going to do, when to find out where we're on the, we're gonna move forward to take five. It never goes uncle Jack has got this under wraps were good technically that is being decisive.

Speaker 1:          01:41:00       It is being decisive. Yes, you can be decisive in intro in trying to uncover what the next move is going to be cause you're not sure, but sometimes people try and you know bs their way through a scenario like that and that again, you're, you're, you don't know what you're doing and you're proving that so it's best to be truthful and say, hey look, we're turned around right now. We're going to form a perimeter, we're going to cut a resection, we're going to find out where we are and then we're going to move. You got 10 minutes. Boom. Everyone was okay. Cool. Good Times.

Speaker 1:          01:41:33       So those, that is a great list of what, what people look for from leaders and sure it's directed at the military, but almost every single one of those is equally applicable to any leadership position. Next, the role of the soldier, part of what makes a man a good soldier, his own, his, his own adoption of the soldiers role. He comes to think and speak of himself as a soldier. What a man thinks of himself affects his behavior. The rail straightener, which is the skilled worker who runs the machine that straightens railroad rails is one man. When he thinks of himself with pride as a rail straightener, he becomes another when he begins as he made to regard himself as a mere wage slave. The rail straightener takes pride in his work, does a good job, is happy the wage slave let's crooked rails get by because he doesn't care the same way the soldier who thinks proudly of himself as a soldier is doing a service to both himself and the army.

Speaker 1:          01:42:41       How smart is that? That is very good. Yeah. So it's like you're kind of introducing a sense of identity, right? And they like their job, like this is what you do and people will do that. You know, the for themselves, you know, I'm a whatever. I remember some time, this is actually quite a while ago, somebody posted a picture of a very intricate plumbing job and it was like 8 million copper pipes and perfectly spaced coming in. And I was like, this dude is proud to be a plumber and it's lunch shows budget. So yes, if you are in a job, get into the job, right. And let me tell you this, if you're not into the job and you want to get out of the job, the best way for you to get out of the job is by getting into the job you're doing something that you don't care about, care about it.

Speaker 1:          01:43:32       Because otherwise people look at you. Why would I promote you? You can't even, you can't even dig this ditch correctly. If you're out there digging that ditch like you, like you mean it like you'd make trying to make a perfect dish in the world. Do it. Yeah. Certain forms of punishment published just public disgrace, ridicule all the role of the soldier and may lessen or destroy his usefulness to the army and his, uh, amenability to leadership the noncommissioned or commission officer who rides one of his men in such a manner as to make him doubt his own value as a soldier is shattering the man's best motive for good performance. The senior leader who reprimands a junior in the presence of his man reduces that junior's value to the army.

Speaker 1:          01:44:13       Almost never good to the little someone in front of the team. Good leadership. On the other hand causes men to build up each for himself a particular role, a specialty. It means a great deal to a man to take pride in being a soldier into being a sharp shooter, an aviation mechanic, a truck driver, a cook or a radio operator. Competent leaders criticize a, a poor piece of work. Condemn a mistake but never take but take care of to never make a soldier feel he is a failure at his job. So you can criticize the mistake that they made but don't criticize their, uh, their ability in that job. When a soldier begins to regard himself as being part of his unit and when his job has become part of his role, then teamwork has enormously improved. The soldier who thinks of himself as only a private temporarily on this or that assignment is a different man from the soldier who thinks of himself as a necessary member of his outfit. Good information. And here's how we get to selection of leaders. Rank is no guarantee of the ability to judge leadership in others, nor are good leaders necessarily competent to assess good leadership and others. The test of competent judge is his successful predictions in the past.

Speaker 4:          01:45:36       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:45:37       so you might be the highest ranking guy, but that doesn't mean you can necessarily figure out who's going to be a good leader unless you show repetitively that you can select good leaders. The interview itself is not a fair or accurate test of the soldier, the man who would make a good leader, maybe a modest man who fails in an interview to exhibit those qualities that would make his men believe in him, trust him, and admire him and the man who could never secure the loyalty of serve subordinates may nevertheless be by assurance and poise by voice and manner, mislead inexperienced judges as to his capacity. So all the time I get asked, what should we, how should I interview? What should I ask? You can only figure out so much fruit. And when I get asked that, I always say, okay, who in here thought they were hiring the best guy that they've ever hired?

Speaker 1:          01:46:24       And he turned out to be a loser and everyone raises their hand. And how many times have you taken a chance on someone that you weren't sure if they're going to work out and they turned out to be a stud? Everyone raises their hand. Yeah. It's really hard to judge who's going to work well and who's not. And that kind of goes for like friends too. You know, like they're, I mean man that happens all the time where you meet someone and you just know you don't really feel them that much, but they end up being your best friend or something like that like years later or something like that. It's weird like that, like situations, even certain first impressions, you know, that that are like they don't indicate the long haul, you know? Yeah, yeah. It takes a little bit time to uncover what people are real about really about in many cases I can tell you like I feel pretty good about judging people.

Speaker 1:          01:47:07       Yeah. And I'm probably like 70% accurate, you know? So that's not a great, like I feel pretty good about it, but I know that I'm only battened 70% yeah. Which is like a c, but the, I wonder if in do you think this, do you think that there's certain things that are maybe even subconscious about people that you can sorta tell after just talking to him for a second, whether it be like for sure they react to, I'm going to ask, this just popped up my mind. I got asked, I was at a event and it wasn't, it was interesting about it. It wasn't with a specific company, which normally are working with a company and I was just at an event where I'm speaking to multiple different companies and this woman stood up to ask a question and as soon as she stood up I was like, this is going to be she, she does not want to hear my answer no matter what I say.

Speaker 1:          01:47:58       But she just stood up with just arrogance dripping off her and, and just, I was like, well, she's not gonna. She's not gonna like this answer. Whatever answer I give, whatever question she asks, she is not, she's not listening. So that, that thought that you had right there when it comes correct? Yeah, it was basically when she stood up and then three words out of her mouth, I was like, for real here. I was like, yeah. And, and it's also interesting because you know, she just, when you're working with a single company, they're all kind of on board and they're all kind of like, they're, maybe they're not on board with what you're saying, but they're unified as a group trying to move in a certain direction. So we have a random group of people and the woman stands up and I could tell right away, yep, she's got it.

Speaker 1:          01:48:49       She does. She, there's no answer. I'm going to give her, that's going to make her happy. What did it feel like? It was like subconscious, like what's it like or where you like see the visual cues? It was visual cues and then the opening of the question, and I can't remember what it was, but it was like, Oh yes, confirmed, let me tell you. So it was one of those, it was one of those, you know, and so what I did was I preempted my answer and I said, you're, you know, cause then she asked a question and I said, you're actually not going to like my answer to this question, but I'm just going to tell you what I've seen. And I appreciate the question. And then I answered the question. And of course she didn't like the answer. You don't know why she didn't like the answer because the answer was the leadership question.

Speaker 1:          01:49:33       And the problem with the people that you're having is not a problem with the people that you have. It's a problem with you, which is the way it is with all leadership problems. When you have a problem with your team, your team isn't performing the way you want them to do. It's, it's, it's, oh, they're lazy. Oh, they don't do the mission correctly. Well, whose fault is that? You're the leader. You're the leader in charge of the people. So if they're not doing the mission that you want them to execute it or how you want them execute it, you can't blame them. They literally work for you. You are the boss of them. So let's list, look, do you want to explain to me how you give them the direction you want to talk to me about like what, what sort of direction you give them, how you communicate with them.

Speaker 1:          01:50:15       And we went down that road, you know, but at the end of the day she sat down with no, she took nothing. I said onboard zero. And this is a fairly rare occasion, you know, that's why I remember, this was a couple of years ago, but I remember it because I thought, Yup, she didn't. She's, when she stood up, I set up, she's not listening to me and then she's not gonna like my answer. And then when she sat down I said, Yup, she's going to walk out of here and go, that guy didn't know what he was talking about. This, it's not my, it's not my problem that my team is all jacked up. It's not my, it's not my fault that my team is lazy. One of her key components of her statement was that her team was lazy and they weren't meeting the standards. And the answer to that question isn't, you know, beat them harder cause that doesn't work.

Speaker 1:          01:51:02       The answer that question is you as a leader are not doing a good job of leading them or there is a chance that your team is completely incompetent and you need to train them or get rid of them. Guess what? Both of those things are your responsibility. You're the leader. You need to train them or you need to get rid of them. So worse answering the world isn't the best. It's the worst dancer in the world. It hurts, you know, life talks about this, Dave talks about like when he was like, when he's writing, no bad teams, only bad leaders. He's literally thinking about things that he did where he was blaming his team, you know, and he's just looking and he's looking back on here. I was blaming my team and in none of it was my fault. And that's, that's the revelation that you have.

Speaker 1:          01:51:49       I've seen literally witnessed this and like a bunch of times too where people would stand up, which with what I thought was sort of that sort of feel that tone, like, oh, like they're gonna, they're just gonna Stump. You Miss [inaudible] mister know it all, you know, kind of attitude. And you tell him that answer. Like it's like, hey, it's your responsibility. You know? And then I can see their mind just totally changing you and they accept it. And actually going back to this woman, when I was talking to this woman, I immediately tried to like frame it in the most humble way to not offend her ego. You know, when I told them, when I told her, you know, you're not going to like the answer I give you. I didn't say it like that. I was like, look, I'm going to give you an answer that I, I got a feeling you're probably not even gonna like this answer, but I just going to tell you kind of what I've seen, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:52:37       So I tried to do my best to not hit her ego in the face. The problem was her ego was big and strong and dug in and leading the way leading out front. And so it was, you know, and that always bums me out and it doesn't happen very often. Like I said, I mean this is two years ago or something like that and I'm remembering this person asking this question, I'm trying to think of myself that she doesn't want to hear what I'm going to do. What she wanted me to say is, yeah, you're right, your team is so horrible and the exception, you know, they're probably just hate, you know the world and they don't want to do like, like you know what it is. They probably don't want to do a good job. They probably don't want to get promoted. They probably don't want to make any extra money.

Speaker 1:          01:53:22       They probably want to go home unsatisfied with your job. That's their, that's their deal. Right. And I'm sorry that you've been burdened with this horrible team that feels that way. Yeah. Right. Cause that's absolutely true. You don't have a whole, you might have one or two people on your team that aren't very enthusiastic, but you're not going to have a whole team that no one wants to do. Good job. No one wants to put in any extra effort. No one wants to work hard, but you don't have a whole team like that. And by the way, if you do have a team like that gas, what it is your responsibility to get rid of those members that don't want to do what they need to do to win.

Speaker 1:          01:54:04       Yeah. A lot of times when it happens, when I lead people down that that question, they'll be like, hey, you know, I've got this department, and I'll say, oh, okay, well you know, I got this department and they got these, these mid level managers and they're all horrible. I'm like, oh, well that's, that's terrible. Who, who's in charge of the mid level managers? Oh, well it's this guy. Okay, who's in charge of that guy? Oh, this other guy who's in charge of that guy. Well, I am. Okay, so whose fault is this man? Yeah, it's your fault. It's truly your fault. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:54:37       Funny, you'll do this technique, which I always find pretty impressive. Like as far as the little chip, it's almost like a, it's not a chess game cause it's not you against the asker of the question, but there's an element to it. We're just like that. Like how you'd like make them answer their own questions kind of thing. Where, but you'll go, you'll say, oh, do you, do you think that they just want to do a bad job? And they'd be like, oh no, no, no, no, nothing like that. Oh, do you think that like, um, that they want your company to fail the, you know, those questions that goes up and down the chain of command to cause some of like, well, my boss doesn't do this. I'm like, did you think of your boss wants to lower your profitability? Do you think your boss wants you to do things that are less safe?

Speaker 3:          01:55:14       You think your boss wants you to have people leaving on a regular basis? Do you think your boss wants more turnover? Do you think your boss, you go right down the list? And of course it's, no, no, no, no, no. And eventually you realize, oh look so calm. Here's me cause I'm not communicating well enough to explain to my boss when I need. Yes, that's a good one. But it's, it's good to also not only as like something fun to kind of watch or whatever, but um, you know, so you watched them kind of gain understanding. That is cool for sure. But it helps because it helps even me or people like put it into

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       perspective. You know, like men, no one's against you bro. You're like, hey, you know, make some right moves in, say some right things and men get up, get on the same page. And by the way, most of the time when someone is against you, because there are times, you know, you got that person that's a, just wants to get promoted and they're looking to step all. It's like, do a good job, do a great job, keep working hard, make them look good. What are you talking about? No, you make them look good. It will come back. It will come back back to the book. The only proof of leadership is leadership and the best thing to do is give it a chance to emerge and then have competent men judge whether it has appeared. So this is another, it's just hard to know what people are like until you actually put them in this situation.

Speaker 1:          01:56:39       Although young men can make excellent leaders, leadership develops with experience, no doubt about that. It is known moreover that the men have a platoon can size each other up, effectively, can pick out men who deserve advancement more consistently than leaders camp the men. No competence when they see it. Thus, it appears that the officer who fails to find out quietly the opinions of his subordinates when he is selecting a man for promotion is overlooking a valid source of information. One that is in the long run, far more accurate than his own judgment. So listen to your people leader. Next section. Very important or important leadership can be learned. There are no born leaders. All leadership is based on learning how to deal with men. Nearly all leaders improve after they have had some experience in command. Some improved faster than others and some continued to improve while others do not. So there are no born leaders.

Speaker 1:          01:57:47       Okay, we know my debate on this, I actually disagree with that. Well I should say this. Okay, there might not be born leaders but there are people that are born with certain aptitudes with for a variety of leadership qualities. And somebody posted something on social media that said there's an a gene, there is a gene that you have or don't have as a human being that relates to your ability to articulate. So guess what? If you are born with that dream Jean and you have a high level ability to articulate and communicate with other human beings, you are born with more aptitude to become a leader. Could you end up still being a terrible leader? Yes. Cause there's some people that are very articulate that are horrible leaders, but it is one attribute that you are born with doesn't necessarily make you a leader. Right?

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       It gives you more aptitude to be a leader. So maybe that is correct. You're not born a leader, but you're born with a little more aptitude to be a leader. Back to the book, consider the qualities which enlisted men believe important in leaders. The first is competency and ability. Competence is based on learning. The good leader has learned his job thoroughly, so there you go. That makes sense. His men can trust him to know what he's doing. He knows not only what he learned in his training courses, but he's kept it up to date. If he has an artillery man, he knows how the Germans use artillery and what guns they have. The s the rule is a simple one. Know your stuff so that I agree with you. Learn to be competent. Second to competence is the officer's interest in the soldier as a man, a demonstrated interest that gives the soldier confidence that when he stands up to hardship or is in trouble, the hardship is a necessary part of the job and his troubles give his officer concerns.

Speaker 1:          01:59:40       So you've got to care about your people. And actually what's interesting about this whole section, if you remember this, is this is saying there's no born leaders, but there's a whole section in the first part of this book that talks about Pete men have different aptitudes and skills that they either have or they don't have. And some of it had to do with, you know, you are a truck driver in the civilian sector, so you're gonna make a good truck driver in the military. But it also talked about how some people aren't, don't have the aptitude for certain jobs. So they're being a little bit hypocritical here just a little bit. Okay, so we're talking about caring about people and here it says every man can buy, can buy, practice, improve his skill in human understanding and increased his repertoire of actions that demonstrate interest in others.

Speaker 1:          02:00:27       The rule here is low, is less simple. It is know your men and show it. No their names, their history, their weaknesses, their good points there. Morale begin by studying their qualification cards. So that's another skill that you can get better at. Decisiveness is a skill harder to acquire, but it can with attention be it cultivated. When you have a hard choice, remember, you do not usually have to make a snap judgment. Careful consideration. Weighing the merits of alternate courses is not indecision. Your men will respect your judgement even more if you deserve. If you reserve decision until you are in possession of all the facts necessary for a wise choice, do not set up a council of war to pass things by vote. You are the leader, but seek advice when you need it. And do not hesitate to call on your subordinates for council if they are qualified to give it. But choose your course before you give the orders, which we already heard. So there's, and this is also a little bit contrary, we're not contrary, but this is an addendum to what was being said earlier, that you gotta be decisive. And here is saying, look, you gotta be decisive, but you can take your time. You want to measure everything out.

Speaker 1:          02:01:45       Another suggest, another suggestion to the leader is remember when you're men, do not understand you that it is your fault. You must talk their language, plain language. If you cannot express yourself clearly, it may be because you do not understand the subject to yourself. Think things through carefully before you try to explain. So there you go. A little extreme ownership, a little simplicity in there. A leader then to be worthy in the eyes of his men would do well to follow these commands. Number one, be competent. Number to be loyal to your men as well as to your country and army. Number three, know your men. Understand them. Love them. Be Proud of them. Number four, accept responsibility and give clear decisive orders.

Speaker 2:          02:02:45       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:02:46       Number five, teach your men by putting them through the necessary action. Number six, give only necessary orders. Bought. Number seven, get things done. Number Eight, be fair. Number nine, work hard. Number 10 remember that a leader is a symbol men need to respect and trust. You. Don't let them down.

Speaker 2:          02:03:20       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:03:20       so there you go. They they wrap it all back into

Speaker 1:          02:03:25       from everything we started started this thing talking about when you're talking about discipline and obedience. Hmm. This whole thing about being a leader has nothing to do with obedience. It has to do with being a good leader. Yeah, and that's how they wrap up that chapter. That's solid information in there. Now this next section is about mobs and panic and what's interesting about this is as a human being in charge of other human beings, you have to understand how mobs and panic on fold going back to the book, men and a mob act just as much in keeping with their past training and habits as they would if they were alone. But part of this training which men get from earliest childhood is to follow the example of other individuals and also to respond to their gestures, facial expressions and tones of voice as well as other as well as the spoken words of others.

Speaker 1:          02:04:19       That's an interesting concept, isn't it? It's a little trick statement because what it's saying is, hey, when you've got a mob of people, they are acting in accordance with how they've been trained, but then you think yourself wasn't in the army, then they wouldn't act that way. But then it goes on to say they'd been trained since day one to imitate people. So you're actually fighting against the rest of their training when you're trying to get them to not do something that everyone else is doing. And by the way, it's, it's an important thing that usually is beneficial and it goes into some of that here. When a soldier misunderstands a command, he starts to execute it as he interpreted it. But suppose in the middle of a movement, he become suddenly aware that the other men in ranks are doing something very different. Immediately he corrects his action to do what others are doing.

Speaker 1:          02:05:07       So most of the time it's beneficial. That little mob mentality, in the same way, the site of a leader running or galloping to the rear in a combat area may start a whole company heading after him on the double. His example can become as much a command as or order as his words. Mostly. It is a good thing that men naturally follow the example of others. It makes the world run more smoothly. Yet the good principal has vicious results. When mobs form or panic starts. Why mobs for moms form because some one event or condition has brought people together and captured the attention of every person in the crowd. Usually the mom is angry about something and it is and it's angry. Excitement makes it ready for action. Panic based on fear is something else. So a differentiate between the mob that is angry and the mob that is afraid.

Speaker 1:          02:06:00       That's panicking besides a common focus of attention. So that's one element is the common focus of attention. Emotion is characteristic of all mobs. Since a mob is driven by powerful emotion, it is not necessarily crazy to do something. It wants action so it only takes a cry of Lynch him or burn it to set the mob in motion. Mostly when you get into a crowd you join it, you do just what other people do. The site of others, seizing stones or starting an attack. So grips the men watching them that they think of no other course of action mobs. Therefore our uncritical interesting statements about mobs. I'm trying to think when have you been a part of a mob before? No, I mean in that regard, no, I've been at some shows and by that I mean hardcore shows back in the day where the mob would start to get something, you know, like whether it was breaking down a barrier and yeah, you get swept up in that mob mentality.

Speaker 1:          02:07:05       It's group think this one's talking about panic. Soldiers do not often for mobs, mob action among soldiers usually occurs when they are away from the usual reminders in circumstances of discipline when they are on leave and mingling with men from our, the organization's without leadership, but panic can occur in the best drilled. Thirdly, season troops, it can occur in the midst of combat. Some of the greatest routes in history have been cases of panic. The panicked group is much like a mob, but it acts from fear, not anger. It's attention is focused on the object of fear. It's thought and it's talk is of danger and disaster. It's aim is escape. Action becomes definite and mob like only when obstacles to escape are encountered. It doesn't take much to set off a panic among troops who are panic ripe. Then a single cry of gas or run or we're caught off may start a mad flight and here it talks about panic ripeness.

Speaker 1:          02:08:08       Anything that makes men tense on edge, jittery and over sensitive to slight noises, half hidden sites or sudden movements, we'll make them easy victims of panic. For this reason, prolonged anxiety makes men panic ripe, so does over fatigue, too much beer or liquor or a hangover. So does lack of proper food, especially deficiency of B vitamins and so does exhaustion from lack of sleep. Prolonged exposure to noise and alarm of modern battle may produce the jumpy state of mind from which panic arises. One main cause of panic is lack of training. Training must cover practice and defense and retreat as well as in attack. If panic is to be avoided if the retreat is not to turn into a route, the sight of one or several men running to the rear, the site of others throwing away their gear. Weapons may cause a general scramble and discarding of arms bad morale is another cause of panic.

Speaker 1:          02:09:08       Rumor sometimes plays an important part in Redding. Men for panic. Poor leadership can make the ground ready for panic, impairing the confidence and command necessary to hold troops to the performance of duty. How to stop a panic. This is very important. Once a panic has begun, the only way to Holt it is to capture attention and then provide, provide positive, clear commands. Leaders must act with decision, firmness and courage. If no officer is present, any self possessed man can assume leadership and give the scared men what they need. Clear, confident direction. So I think the important is to import important parts. You've got to get their attention and then you got to give simple, clear, concise commands, positive commands and then it goes on to say, but the best way to stop a panic is never to have it at all. Train all men through release so that they have confidence in themselves, their leaders, their weapons.

Speaker 1:          02:10:10       Train their leaders and select the best of them. Let good leaders build up good morale, avoid hunger, thirst and boredom as much as possible to do in war and all the conditions that lead to nervous tension and complaint. If you could not avoid them. And war is no bed of roses. Fight them with good morale. Fight the feeling of insecurity. Tell the men all they need to know. Let them know all possible information about the enemy, where he is, what he is like, how we attacks, what weapons he is using. Last but not least, build up faith. Be sure the men know why they are fighting, why it is a good cause. Let them be sure that their officers are with them all the way. Faith in an ideal plus faith in your leaders plus faith in other fellows in your unit can win victory against superior forces.

Speaker 2:          02:11:02       Okay,

Speaker 1:          02:11:03       so there you go. You got to watch out for that. Next section. Differences among races and people's modern total war has placed a new responsibility on the shoulders, shoulders of the soldier once his only task was to destroy the enemy. But now psychological warfare requires him to play a new role. He must help when allies for Uncle Sam in many strange lands, and this is what's interesting, we always think of world war well. We think of World War Two for sure as, hey, this is total war. You're not worried about hearts and minds, which was, you know, the campaign it in really in Vietnam it was hearts and minds. It's where that kind of originated and certainly in Iraq and Afghanistan, we think all those guys didn't have to deal with this back in the day. You have to deal with this. Now we are. We have to worry about the civilian populace and all this. Guess what we're wrong. Hmm. 1942 they're talking about this and it goes into, there are no infallible recipes for making friends the world around. But there are two basic rules for all soldiers in the manual of psychological arms. Number one, mind your manners. Number two, understand and respect the manners of strangers, especially strangers who might help both you and the cause for which you were fighting seems pretty obvious.

Speaker 2:          02:12:27       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          02:12:30       And no one thinks that in world war two they had to watch their manners, but you do. Next one talking about race, color of the skin is often the basis for prejudice because it is so clearly a badge of difference between people's, uh, mark that sets one people apart as different as not one of us American whites have been prejudice not only against blacks skins but also against yellow and against copper skins of the American Indian. The United States excluded both jabs and Chinese from immigration. When our western states became afraid of their cheap labor and the old German Kaiser invented the slogan, the yellow peril, when he wished to unite Europe against the Asiatics. And what I find interesting about this whole thing is this is 1942 so this is pre civil rights movement in America and yet we find the military forward leaning on civil rights and we'll get to that. Sometimes the prejudice against the negroes flares up in the army. It is not a problem. However, in a camp where it is well understood that a soldier in the United States uniform is a soldier, not a white or a Negro Christian or Jew rich man or poor, but a soldier. And as such worthy of respect

Speaker 1:          02:14:01       and not everyone feels race prejudice. There are plenty of white men who are constantly meeting and working with black, brown and yellow men of education, culture, brain's inability. These white men know that skin color is not a sign of inferiority or superior or superiority and they tend to forget about it or at least to regard it is or at least regarded as unimportant. These white men are numerous in Europe, South America, Asia and Africa where the races are mixed up in business and in politics.

Speaker 2:          02:14:31       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:14:32       the American soldier will be on the right track when he realizes that the differences are superficial, that other races while different from his own or not necessarily inferior, he will know that he cannot tell just from a man's color whether that man will bind up his wounds, guide him to a hospital when he his last feed him. If he is hungry or help them repel enemy invaders, it will help him to remember that skin color in itself means nothing about the intelligence, wisdom, honesty, bravery or kindliness of a man. If he studies carefully the people of other races whom he meets, he can satisfy himself that this is true. So again, 1942 pre civil rights and the military is saying, Hey, guess what folks? Race doesn't matter. And by the way, still a segregated army,

Speaker 2:          02:15:33       but

Speaker 1:          02:15:34       they're moving in the right direction. How to win friends in foreign lands. Every American soldier in a foreign land becomes an American diplomat. He has his role to play in making strange people into Americans, America's friends. Here's some rules he will find helpful. Again, this is so interesting to read because I'm telling you when you're in the military you think all these guys back to the night team, World War Two, they didn't have to worry about that and we just went over there and kicked ass shit. And it's like here they were getting the briefs. This is the brief. This is the big brief and here's some things that that will help you be a good diplomat.

Speaker 2:          02:16:17       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:16:17       and this is applicable like this is when you go and work with a new company, guess what you want to, you want, you do want to win the hearts and minds. Here's a couple tips. One, try. First of all the understand strange customs habits and ways of thinkings. Number two, respect these customs and habits of thought even when you can't understand them and even when they seem unpleasant or a feminine or crazy. Three when you cannot respect foreign countries, then suppress your disapproval, stifle your emotions. When you can respect foreign customs, show it. You can win many friends for America in this simple way. Five, when you associate with foreign people try to adopt their manners. Do not ask them to adopt yours.

Speaker 2:          02:17:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:17:06       Suppress your own peculiarities as far as possible when they are contrary to the customs of the land.

Speaker 2:          02:17:14       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:17:15       Number seven, when foreign customs or none of your business in mind only your own business. Number eight, be friendly after all, the only way to make other men like you is to like them. And number nine, take people as they come like them for what they are, not for the way they happen, to measure up to your own standards, what you expected of them. So really good guidance just in general for humans. Those interesting there, there,

Speaker 3:          02:17:47       what did, what did he say? If it's like if their customs or a feminine or, yeah, so I remember what I was learning Spanish in high school and they were talking about there's a difference between Spanish in Spain and Mexico and different, you know, it's a different

Speaker 1:          02:18:02       Castilian Spanish versus that's what they speak in Spain. Oh, for real? Yeah. And in Mexico they speak, I don't know if they call it Mexican Spanish.

Speaker 3:          02:18:09       Hmm. But it's fast still. I remember, you know, in part of the, you know, the course, um, they were talking about different customs and stuff like that. So I guess, you know, in, in Spain they say the SS with a list like a tea or disease, it's just a little bit. Yeah. Um, but there was this one custom that I can remember that they're like, oh yeah. It's not uncommon to see like men holding hands when they're free. You know, how like, Hey your, do you have your hand? Right guys? Just holding hands. That's how you know. And um, I remember thinking that's interesting. You know, because that's something that's really far from custom here. Yeah. Yeah. But we will have her hand like our arm around, you know when you're a kid you got your arms around your boys.

Speaker 1:          02:18:51       Yeah. But you're not, you're not just walking around like that sometimes I guess. I don't know when you're, you're doing it. Okay. You're a kid. Yeah. You're walking off the football field after a good play. Sure. You might have your arm around. You're right. Yeah. You're not walking down the sidewalk. Cater to a movie with your arm. Right. Your buddy that's not happening. Yes. So you're right. And that, that custom of holding hands is really common throughout. Like dude's holding hands is a real common throughout the rest of the world. Like lots of different places do that. Yeah. And it's definitely, we definitely get some funny situations where the, the, the seal that's, you know,

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       Super Macho and we're over working with some in some foreign country and some guys, you know, they, they're talking to them, they start to like him or wherever they started getting along. We're going to start holding the hands on. I'll walk over to the galley. He see she see a TV as leg and nod out. Somebody needs to brief you on our customs. We don't do that well according to the book. That's what I'm saying. You got to, you know, just go ahead and hold the advancements in homeboy. But yeah, that's the kind of thing that, that is rough for Americans, especially American dudes to get over. We're just going to walk around holding hands or like, you know how um, in Europe they'll like kiss not necessarily on the lips necessarily. Right. Butt Cheek, right? Yeah. He tried to kiss me on the cheek. Dud that make me weird for the day is jam me weird for the day for me to do it.

Speaker 3:          02:20:21       If I send me random. Yeah, no kissing is no factor in much of the world for, for a guy to kiss another guy like, hey good to see you plant one on me. Here's an American. It's like, Hey, good to see you. Keep out of my personal space. Actually you don't have to be honest. Um, I don't care like people actually some of my friends, they, you know, some, you know like the Italian mafia kind of thing. Like they'll build it and we'll do that. So my friends, they kind of know what the f you know what thing broke down my personal space more than anything else. Yes I do. Yes. She just uses the whole thing of like hugging another dude when you see him. I think that stemmed from Jujitsu. Oh frill. I don't remember ever doing that before Jujitsu. I have to think more, but it just cause cause you did, sue is so close anyways that when you, you know, you're just like that's the way it is.

Speaker 3:          02:21:14       Yeah. So do Jitsu once again, spreading for the spreading customs around the world, breaking down boundaries, breaking down boundaries. They broke down boundaries for me in Hawaii, there's a lot of kissing that goes on, mostly between, um, like between slightly, you know, like girls and guys, like even like if it's like your friend's wife, you kiss him on the cheek. That's how like it's in fact if you don't, it's kind of like, hmm. That was kind of standoffish kind of thing. Not a huge deal, but it's like, it's that normal in Hawaii. Um, but guys and guys, you know, I don't, I don't think that that's an issue. Like if someone kissed me on my cheek when they saw me and it was a guy, I love you bro, whatever. Like that wouldn't, that wouldn't move me either way. That'd be like, yeah, fine. But I'm saying if you, you did cause you would have like a specific type of personality, you know, they'd be like, that's a new new thing for chocolate. Guess that would be a new exploration, I guess. Brother. There was a time where I think we're doing like a Facebook live or something and we're talking about cauliflower ear and um, and I was like oil. So I said something about late after your ears are like soft. And then I went and you were right next to me and I, and I like, like flipped

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       your ear or something. And when I watched the live later, the look on your face was like, you were genuinely, not in a big way but genuinely slightly offended by my ear. Like it was micro was there. I was at my Jujitsu Academy when I was in Virginia Beach and there was a buddy of mine, another seal, and I had gotten him into Jiu Jitsu and he was a small guy, like one 41 45 scenario and, but you know, he was like a white belt, had been trained in and whatnot. And um, we were both, so now we were training and one night I showed up at the academy and we both showed up at the same time, like similar time. And in this academy it was Gustava Machado and Guga as his nickname. Great Dude. And so we, and Google is academy at the time was pretty small and it had one bathroom and the bathroom is where you would change.

Speaker 1:          02:23:20       So like put your d on or whatever. So my buddy goes in there and he starts changing. And me being just like a team guy, I'm like, whatever I'm going into. So, and he's a lot smaller than me and I'm a blue belt at this time. So you know, there's, there's that level of, of uh, you know, like Keke he knows that the situation unfolds. I can submit him. That's the way it is. And so I just bust into the bathroom and he's in there. He's changing. So He's, you know, I don't know if he was completely naked, but he was pretty close. And I come in and just drop my a rip off my shirt, dropped my shorts and, and, and, and I hear him go, oh, and then he goes, and then he goes, uh, think of a happy place. We both started laughing, but, um, yeah, don't care about any of that stuff. So there you go, try and try and accept other people's customs and don't try and impose your customs on them or you're not doing good for the diplomacy of the country. Yeah, yeah. Like, even when you go to like France, not to keep the customs thing going too long, but whether it be France or wherever. Right.

Speaker 1:          02:24:42       Here's the, it's a hard one. So let's say you go to the beach where they can go topless. They're at the beach, right? What if you're with your wife or whatever and your wife's like, oh, we're in France. I want to go topless. You know, how do you feel about that? Whatever. All good. I don't think we're going to a topless beach actually. What she wanted to go though, she doesn't answer the way I would see it. We're so conservative. Right? Isn't that crazy? We're super conservative for it to actually, puritans are legit. Yeah. I like the puritans. It meant that's the New England. There's a little thread of puritanism up in New England and I was like that. Yeah, I can dig it. Um,

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       at a topless beach, I would let totally let my wife go. Totally. Except if there is anyone there that we knew.

Speaker 3:          02:25:33       Interesting. So like if my brother's friends or if my friend, unless it was her girlfriends, I wouldn't care. But yeah, if it was any of our friends that we knew there were guys that would bother me, I think, well my wife just be, she'd be wearing a swimsuit. This is no real big discussion. Right. The Edna, I did dig it. Would you wear, you know how they were like the more what, like the trunks that are like speedo type trunks. That's how you know it's a, it's a speedo. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Would that be all you are? We need to stick with this. I wear surf shorts. I probably, you got books as in Brazil, you know, it's called a song gow yet. Hello? Yeah. And Dean lister, this the,

Speaker 2:          02:26:16       Oh,

Speaker 1:          02:26:17       I'm good friends with dean. Sure. He went through a phase of wearing a sung gow

Speaker 3:          02:26:22       yeah. A lot to train him and like that at all dudes basically wearing a speedo and beating me up and not fun. Yeah. And he'd go with no shirt for sure. So yeah. That, that's um, yeah, where that [inaudible] needs to do that for sure. They used to be pretty common for, it's definitely faded right now. Yeah, for sure. The idea of just wearing the tidy whities song. Gow grappling. Yeah, for sure. For sure. Fully. But on the beach though, you got to lay up Brazil, Brazil. That's your normal. That's, that's the custom, but not you. You're not going to adopt that customer. I'm American dude. I know Bro. But you, when you go to these foreign lands to America, you know, turn the box me. I'm just saying the book said, I didn't say the book said, you know, and you're just, you're going to so bay, that Brown, whatever you like.

Speaker 1:          02:27:09       Yeah. I'm going to stick to this. Your dish. That's what we do over here. Yes sir.

Speaker 1:          02:27:16       You done? Yes sir. Trying to frame me up. Rumor, rumor is the most primitive way of spreading stories by passing on from mouth to mouth. It is just as inefficient, inaccurate and unaccountable as it is. Primitive. Rumors are repeated by even by those who do not believe the tails. That's an interesting statement and it's very true. This is this. This is an interesting state. When you look at it from the viewpoint of fake news right now and Russian bots, rumors are repeated by even those who do not believe the tails. There is a fascination about them. The reason is that they cleverly designed is that cleverly designed rumors give expression to something deep in the hearts of the victims, the fears, suspicions, forbidden hopes or daydreams, which they hesitate to voice directly. So if a commanding officer can keep track of the rumors that are going around among his men, he will learn a great deal about their current fears and hopes.

Speaker 1:          02:28:13       He will have a sort of barometer that registers the rises and falls of their morale. That's a good point. People are out. We're going to get attacked. That means everyone's afraid that they're going to get attacked or we're not going to be, we're not going home on time, okay? Everyone's concerned about that, so pay attention to those rumors. A rumor is not always a lie, not always a malicious story, and there are uses of rumor in war. You can use it for disruption. You can use it as a smokescreen. You can use it for discrediting news sources. This is a special technique and they weren't doing that all the time. Now there's different kinds of rumors. There's the pipe dream rumor, I thought pipe dream was a modern term. There's the pipe dream rumor which depends on wishful thinking. There's pleasure and believing and repeating what you hope is true. The boogie man rumor is the opposite of the pipe dream. It expresses fear, not a wish. The wedge driving rumor, perhaps the most dangerous of all is the rumor that attempts to create hostility and distrust between allies or between particular groups within a country.

Speaker 1:          02:29:23       So you have to watch out for that. What makes rumor work, and I think this is probably the most important part of this section. Rumors thrive on fertile soil. What soil is fertile? Lack of information about important things, favor rumor, rumors encouraged by discontent, frustration, boredom and idleness. Expectation fosters rumors. Censorship since it blocks important news favors rumor and from those that you can get to how to control rumor one, ensure good faith in official communications. If the public loses confidence in the reliability of the communications of the armed forces and of the press and radio than rumors began to spread fast. So you've got to tell the truth to develop faith in leaders. People can stand, people can stand censorship and lack of news when they feel they are sure that they are not being told falsehoods and that what is being held back is being held back for good reason. That applies to all leaders from the president to the humble, his school teacher from the general to the corporal

Speaker 1:          02:30:36       three present as many facts as possible. Let the press and radio give as full and circumstantial news as they can without giving too much aid to the enemy. But the armed forces do the same. Men want facts when they can't get facts they take. This is something that we all the time in echelon front, we'll go into a company and they're having problems with the rumors and the reason that they're having problems with rumors is cause the the people. The leadership is not explaining what is happening. So there's, for whatever reason, they decide they're going to close down a location. You know, maybe it's because the rent was too high and they're gonna look for a different space. Maybe it's because the market had dropped down there so much that it was a, it was losing money. But what's the rumor when if you don't tell people about, the rumors were called out of business, so they already shut down Pleasanton and whatever the, we're going down find a new job.

Speaker 1:          02:31:29       So when you don't explain to people what's going on, it's good. I just had a, a guy, uh, leader who had to get rid of somebody and then a turned into a big email craziness where the guy that got fired sent his closing email to everyone. I'm going to miss you guys. I'm sorry that it didn't work out. I hope this doesn't bode bad for everyone else. Like one of those, right? Mass email. So, and the guy going, what? What do you think I should do? I mean, this is, I shouldn't have to like respond. And I said, you don't have to respond, but if you don't respond, these people are going to create. They're going to run with everything he said. So craft an email and say, hey everyone, sorry to see Billy. Go Billy. We wish you luck. Or maybe you don't include Billy on the email.

Speaker 1:          02:32:27       In fact, it probably wouldn't, but sorry to see Billy go, here's what happened. Here's what unfolded here was our financial situation. We were actually losing money in his division. Uh, not for one month, not for three months, but for 14 straight months. I had asked him repeatedly to conduct or to make these changes and he hadn't made any changes. And although I like Billy as a person, I couldn't sacrifice everyone at this company. For one person, what we need is to be profitable. And with Billy in charge of that division, we're losing money. And as the leader, I can't allow my loyalty to one person to Trump my loyalty to everyone here. Therefore I had to let him go. Now we've gotten that room under control. Next keep men and women busy. Was it? What's funny is that leader was telling me this, you, I never had to do this before. Tell everyone an email. What's going on? Oh, you never had an email, right? Email's relatively new, you know, and so it's not like somebody was sending out a mass email, throwing darts at spears, that everyone's from the, from their email for keep men and women busy prevent idleness and Ma Monotony. Empty minds are easily filled with untruths and worries. Idle hands make busy tongues fight rumor mongering campaign against rumor, expose it as enemy propaganda. Discredit specific rumors as inaccurate and false caricature rumormongers.

Speaker 1:          02:34:09       And this section is called psychological warfare. Interestingly enough, death can be inflicted upon the bondy's of an enemy destruction upon property. But defeat is a conquest of the mind. In total war, economic, military and psychological action are all used to bring about submission in the enemy. Economic Action deprives the enemy of vital materials. Military action destroys his armies by killing, capturing, scattering the soldier smashing or capturing the guns, tanks, planes, trucks, and supplies. But it is successful psychological action that in the end it deprives the enemy of his will to resist and can spoil the individual soldier as a fighting machine by removing the one thing that makes him fight the hope of success. The soldier without hope is like a tank without gas. When you come right down to it. All warfare, military and economic to is psychological warfare. Since willingness to surrender is a state of mind, all these different means are used to bring about a change of mind to convert determination to resist into willingness to accept defeat.

Speaker 1:          02:35:28       The chief tool of psychological warfare, the one that is most peculiar, particularly psychological, is propaganda. Since propaganda tries to change opinion, the people who plan propaganda have to know all about the opinions of those. They are trying to change. You can't be intelligent about changing anything unless you know what it is you're trying to change. Good point, and then it talks about how you figure out what people's opinions are. You have to gather that information and how to pull for that information. Then it talks about a little bit about propaganda. The truth is the best propaganda propaganda does not have to be dishonest or lying. Hitler said that a lie will be believed if it is big enough and it may be at first, but the big lies don't stand up. Eventually the truth catches them and unmasks them. The goal of propaganda is always a change in the state of mind. Good propaganda always starts from a fact,

Speaker 2:          02:36:34       okay?

Speaker 1:          02:36:34       There is a formula for victory in psychological warfare. One the enemy must be weary. He must be sick and tired and discouraged to the second step in psychological warfare is to turn disillusionment into despair. To convince the weary enemy that victory is impossible. The third step is to promise something better. Show him a way out the corner to beast, to fights to the death unless he sees a way of escape

Speaker 1:          02:37:03       for after the creation of despair, after the promise of something better, there is left there is left still one further step for psychological warfare. The enemy must be led to fix the blame on his own leaders. The soldier who surrenders when he could have fought on must have some excuse and he will find it if his discipline is broken down by his conviction that his own leaders are responsible for is unnecessary predicament. That last step may come of itself, but propaganda can help it. So those are some really important steps and if you think about them, if you think about them from a leadership perspective, they're very, very powerful. If you think about them from a business perspective, they are very, very powerful. And when you know the offense, you also have to understand the defense against psychological warfare. Number one, don't trust the enemy.

Speaker 1:          02:38:00       Remember that broadcasts and leaflets don't necessarily come from the sources from which they claim to come from. And by the way, that also applies to emails, articles, tweets, social media posts. Russian bots be critical. Even though a story starts off with what you know to be true, don't trust the interpretation that is tacked onto the truth. And so don't accept first interpretation. You hear about the reason the battle is won or lost or the reason there isn't any more coffee. Wait, the first story is the best propaganda because it has no other story to overcome but it is not necessarily the best for you to believe. But in general don't trust the enemy. Don't trust the enemy. If he turns friendly, fear him or better understand that he's up to no good. If you are captured, tell them just your name, rank and serial number and nothing else just because he seems friendly and well meaning don't spill things you think are unimportant. It wraps up with this trust only your own leaders there for you. Trust them and be wise and that's kind of an interesting way to to to finish up that book is that statement. Trust them but be wise.

Speaker 1:          02:39:28       Trust you leaders but but at the same time be wise and you've got to pay attention to that because it's a little counter to trust, right? It's saying trust but be wise and I and I actually agree with that question. Everything be wise question, everything question. Your leaders don't follow people blindly. You can put your trust in them. Sure. But at the same time you have to be wise. Be Wise to question them, be wise to try and understand their decisions, be wise enough to disobey them. Should they choose to lead in a manner that is detrimental to the mission, to the strategic objectives and to common sense. Okay. And you know what, you got to be wise not just about your leaders but about everyone. Seek to understand.

Speaker 2:          02:40:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:40:29       Seek to understand people which you do by watching them and by observing them and by listening to them. And you know one thing that we do people do is we spend a lot of time on output.

Speaker 2:          02:40:49       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:40:49       We are sending all the time, we are talking all the time. We are putting information out all the time. Learn to be on receive mode a little bit more. Learn to listen a little bit more. Learn to capture and absorb and utilize a what other people reveal. And when you do that you'll garner a better understanding of them, of yourself, of your team, of your enemy, the nature of the battle itself and the nature of humans themselves. So listen and learn and understand so that you can become wise. Because if you become wise, then you can win. And that wraps up this incredible book, psychology for the fighting man, what you should know about yourself and others. All right, so echo, I know, um, you've got some hopefully some information to tell us how to become a little bit wiser in our movement down the path that our movement towards winning in all aspects of life in this total war that we are fighting on a daily basis in all directions. Yes sir. I do.

Speaker 3:          02:42:17       We got, okay. Do you do to is one of the many ways and now what kind of gear are we going to get when we

Speaker 1:          02:42:24       do Jujitsu, foraging and g? That's the answer. Did people have not been asking me that recently? That's good. That's good. Well, hopefully it's good. Hopefully that signifies

Speaker 3:          02:42:36       that. They already know. They know. Yeah. Hopefully it doesn't signify that people are slowing down. Starting to do actually, which you know what? I know from different input that I'm receiving because I'm out. Resigned on receiving Loredo good that people are starting. Did you still just finished my first Jujitsu class got rolled out? Yeah. Just finished my Jujitsu class. I'm just finished my first stripe on that white belt. Oh yeah. So people are getting on the path for sure. Yeah. And Stain, cause I'm hearing about blue belts. No. Yeah. And we're in that mode. We've been in that mode for for like maybe a year almost where it goes. People are starting to get blue belt started to see blue belts. He

Speaker 1:          02:43:11       merged stripes are sure you are the pro, the, yeah. We're seeing blue belts were three years. A little over three years deep in the podcast. We should have our first hopefully potential Jocko podcast. Blackbelt within seven years is my prediction. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. I would say average 10 years. How long did it take? Maybe it took a few months before people started going, okay, I'm going to start this Jujitsu stuff cause he's guys won't stop talking about it. But I was going at wrestling tournaments. This is, this was awesome. Going to wrestling tournaments and having kids that are freshmen in high school. So there are 1314 years old. Guess what started in grappling? A little jar called wait, no little book called way of the warrior. The warrior kid got them on the path and so now they started that when they were 11 years old, two, three years ago and they read way of the warrior kid.

Speaker 1:          02:44:08       I want to learn how to wrestle and then the kids come up to me. Hey Sir, are you all good? My name's Freddy and I started wrestling because I got into Jujitsu, so thank you. So that's one of the best thing that's happened to me in a long time because why? Because I know that that kid is going to have like legitimately better life because they know how to do Jujitsu and wrestle. Their life will be better. So if you're doing Jujitsu, you get an origin. He getting origin g made in America and designed specifically for [inaudible]? No, for judo, no for hop. Kido? Nope. Designed for one thing. Brazilian Jujitsu. That's what it's made for. And by black belt by, by Jujitsu. Black belt people made it. That's legit. Also got some other clothes up there. T shirts, sweatshirts. We'll working on boots. I can't talk about that yet because then people will be on me for the next whatever as we try and get we can do, we have the machinery in place, we've got models being built. I have a pair, I know you don't have a pair cause you're not quite, you know on the inner inner circle. Yeah. You look really despondent when I said that. That's okay. I broke, I broke his arm anyway. Oh kiss for you later.

Speaker 3:          02:45:41       You get all these things at origin, main.com. Other stuff on there like supplements, most important supplements. I'd lift weights, whatever. And I've always had probably

Speaker 1:          02:45:54       like maybe 15 years I would say.

Speaker 3:          02:45:58       Always said like this elbow, like I wouldn't call it tendonitis, although I have had tendonitis in my elbow. So can you just an elbow thing? Yeah. And so when I first got in joint warfare and the oil go egg Gwyn away complete right. Went away completely. So recently I got like heavy back into limb. Like man I can, you can go right. So it sort of starts to come back. But now it's like at this phase where all feet, like right now if I tried to do like a close grip pushup or something like, like right now in this cold room I'll feel it, but the amount of sets that I have to do to warm it up or now reduced to one one usually it was every single set of more, it was like three, four sets of warmup that my first set I could feel it but I could get over.

Speaker 3:          02:46:40       It was like that. So it's like, and I'm getting older, I'm not getting younger. I know it seems obvious, but given the way my elbow feels, you know, not that obvious. Reviews on people for joint warfare are awesome. People are, they get that where something has been bothering them for so long and they get on the joint warfare for all on the Krill oil and you feel good. That's what makes it, in my opinion, the most important supplement or we kind of something allows you to work harder. So true. So yeah, joint warfare, boom, get down one super krill oil, some added antioxidants in there. And then discipline, which is, it's a combination of two things. It's a little physical energy boost and a mental cognitive increasing capacity to think you. So that's discipline. The drink discipline go is that, but it's in the form of a pill.

Speaker 3:          02:47:39       So or wait, they call it a capsule capsule. Yeah, it's a capsule. I told Brian at orange little, hey man, discipline. I'm addicted to the drink, which I love it. Thank you. Um, for, for helping me get this to the world. However, if I'm going to go up on stage and talk for two hours, I can't pound two bottles of discipline. You know why? It's a real simple reason. It is what it is. It's a biological reason. Yeah. Drink two liters of water and you're going to have to go to the bathroom. Yes sir. I don't want to have to stop. Hey, hold on a minute. Crowd of 700 people. I'm just going to go hit the head real quick. That's not happened yet. So took the discipline formula. We made it into a capsule. Now I can just pop three discipline when I'm going to need, when are we going to need that little edge to edge?

Speaker 3:          02:48:37       You don't, as Jason Gardner put it to me, the word searching gets reduced to zero like you don't word search anymore in your head. You know when you're saying stuff that still is there. Okay. Then there's that energy drink, one version, right? The energy drink is coming is not out yet. Well, the video with JP, yes. Origin, boom. Yeah. Clearly the energy drink is made. It is made, but it's not in production yet, and I'm going to go into why. Well, the reason why it's not in production is because of the way we are producing it, which is a way that no one else is doing because the bottom line is there's all kinds of, what'd you call it? Energy. There's all kinds of energy drinks out there right now, right? They're not good for you. The closest thing you can get to an energy drink that's good for you is actually Jocko white tea.

Speaker 3:          02:49:25       That's the closest thing you can get because it tastes good. It's got some caffeine. Some antioxidants, we're taking that to the next level with the discipline, go ready to drink in a can. It tastes delicious and it's actually good for you. This is the difference. So that'll be out, I'm guessing we're probably not looking for another two months, so no reason to get all excited yet. I'll let you know when it was all out there. In the meantime, the discipline powder is a good variant for now. But yeah, the discipline going to Cannes, it's really, it's nailed. It nailed it for samples. They're gone. I mean, I'm down, I don't drink energy drinks, but if there's like one there that like I know it's going to taste good. I'm Kinda, I'm Kinda, I like those, you know? So that one was like, ah. Yeah. And that's the thing is that it tastes good, which is awesome.

Speaker 3:          02:50:19       It's actually good for you. You know, there's no, it's just so good to go. Also got milk and you wanna get on the milk train for some additional protein in addition to your Ribeye steaks. And here's the thing, in addition to your Tomahawk Ribeye steak. Well yeah, he did the thing, you need additional protein if you're working out. Do you do that straight up? Otherwise your buddy, what eats itself and you want that to happen. And I'll tell you what, even if you don't need additional protein, you know what? You need dessert. Yeah. So luckily milk is its own. Why? What is more? What does this mean? It means really tasty nectar that is going to make you stronger and you can have it for dessert. When you get done having dessert, you won't get done with it and think, oh, I still want some ice cream.

Speaker 3:          02:51:08       No, you'd be like, I'm done with it and I'm done and I'm feeling great. We're good. Okay. So I made this, here's a new little dish in my little, I dunno, whatever. Yeah. So I go egg white omelet with like, I'll take like leftovers can omelet. No. So you know, for example, my wife made pot roast, right? So it's like pot roast. There's little carrots in there. You know, there's potatoes in there. Yes. So I'll take some leftover pot roast and I'll make an egg white omelette with the pot roast, right? It seems kind of what I, but whatever the leftovers is, most part, I'll make an Omelette with it. And so I made it and it's good. That's like good nutrients right there. That's a solid like post workout, whatever tastes good too. And then you know, no sugar, no, you know, it's like legit and tastes really good. So I pound, that was not last night. The night before look pound that. I'm like, man, I'm so, not only did I get a good, healthy, delicious little meal that I made, I'm like, you know how you have say pain in the mood for some dessert and in a way, in a weak mind,

Speaker 3:          02:52:18       in a matter of speaking, in a week, man, you can be like, hey, I had such a healthy dinner. I can kind of, you know, exercise some freedom on the dessert little bit. But I mixed up the milk. Double Win when bone stayed on the discipline path and when your foot, when you're kind of full like that. Sometimes you eat a giant steak but you're still, even though you're pretty full, you want to have a little dessert. Yeah. Little one. Scoop hitter. Yeah, my middle one scoop hitter scoops and lately I will say I've been mixing less milk and more Malke. Okay. Yes. It's thicker, like oily and it's so good. It's like a little, it's a straight up milkshake. Get that hit her as my brother feel. Von would say true. Also warrior kid milk. That's for the kids and think it's for kids until you try that strawberry that too, but that's a good on this sweat.

Speaker 3:          02:53:11       Strawberry chocolate. Is it? That's the only two right now. Right now. Yeah. Yeah, and then the strawberry that's going to go to the regular pretty soon it's coming. We're working on it. He's also, Jack was a store. You going to stay on the path. Good. Of course stay on the path, but if you want to represent while you're on the path, we've got some shirts for you. If you want discipline equals freedom, it's a good one. He gets two versions of that by the way. All the new ones, you know. Yes. And they're both in the game. Fully good ways to represent some hoodies on. They're also more rash guards. So you want to represent and people have been representing tournaments, competitions with get after it, you know, on the rash guard. These are all, yeah, so really good. Yet when you see people straight representing Oh yeah. In the competition, big time. Um, a lot of cool. So again,

Speaker 5:          02:54:02       hats,

Speaker 3:          02:54:04       flex, fit hat, uh, you know, I think we might discontinue the trucker hats, but I see what it, that w we have chapters has zero credit for selling that, that was so bad. Well, we have both truckers had and flex. It had also hoodies. Oh eight already said he's anyway, gone there. Jocko, store.com. If he likes something, get something represent and support. It's true. It's also yourself, Jocko white tea. Okay. Any it can, yes. Okay.

Speaker 5:          02:54:37       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:54:38       Little bit of caffeine in there. Antioxidants deadlift 8,000 pounds. That's good. It's good. Like my wife Dead Lifts 8,000 Times, you know?

It's for little kids, but everyone gets something out of it and it's a cool story that rhymes you and it's delivered very eloquently. If, I don't know if eloquent, the word eloquent is even compatible with, with you as as a whole concept or whatever, but I will, I'll use it. Very eloquent check. So Mike and the dragons for kids also for kids way the warrior kid and weigh the warrior kid too, which is called Mark's mission and also waive the war, your kid three which is called where there's a whale and that book is coming out in the spring. Get your kid these books because they will point them in the right direction on so many things. I wish I had these books when I was a kid so badly and I hope that the kids, you know, read these books and get themselves on the path and if an adult, you know, needs to get on the path, give them the discipline equals freedom field manual, which tells people how to get after it.

Speaker 1:          02:59:15       Everybody needs to know how to get after it. In my opinion. It's a good little daily read. It's not a normal book. It's different. Yes, very different. So check that one out. And then of course there is extreme ownership. The first book that I wrote with my brother Leif Babin and also we just released last year dichotomy of leadership and I'm starting to think there's people starting to comment that dichotomy of leadership is now starting to emerge from the shadow of his older brother. And we're starting to think that dichotomy of leadership is going to be a little bit more yoked, little bit more jacked. And may you serp, the older brother may end up being the one that people really dial into. So check them out. Also speaking of books, if you want this book, psychology for the fighting man or any of the books that Jocko covers, got them on a page on Jocko, podcast.com on the top books from episodes.

Speaker 1:          03:03:33       Charles and I am at Jocko Willink and of course thanks to all our military personnel for standing watch around the world. You protect our freedom and we are indebted to you. We are also indebted to our police and law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics and EMT correctional officer's border patrol, all first responders. You keep us safe and we thank you for your service and sacrifice as well. And to everyone out there listening, remember how many lessons this book gives about the way we think about the way we act, about the way we follow in about the way we lead it. And remember that a good leader doesn't handle his man. A good leader handles himself. That's some of the best advice for leadership and life I've heard in a long time. So follow it. Handle yourself. Keep yourself in check. Keep yourself on the path. Lead yourself so that you okay. Become a person that others will follow and they will follow you on that path. The path of discipline, the path of righteousness, and the path that leads to peace and freedom. So until next time, this is echo and Jocko out.
