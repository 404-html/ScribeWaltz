Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number one 58 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. There was blood all over the floor and smoke in the air. I heard shots fired outside, but I wasn't quite sure who was shooting or what they were shooting at.

Speaker 2:          00:00:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:23       I moved down the hallway confirming that all the rooms had been cleared. I soon found the source of the blood. I wounded Iraqi civilian on who my seal hospital corpsman. A highly trained combat medic was working to apply medical care.

Speaker 2:          00:00:41       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:00:42       and that's just a short little opening from chapter two of the book, the dichotomy of leadership with a that I wrote with my brother Leif Babin and in that chapter I go on to explain how during this operation in Fallujah Iraq, we went on to detain multiple suspected terrorists that night. And I don't go into much detail about that and I don't talk about the people that we captured. We tick, I think we've took, I think we took about 13 people off target, military aged males. We were probably looking for two or three. We weren't, couldn't figure out or confirm who they were. So we brought all the military aged males off target and so we end up at this detention facility and we're turning these individuals over and I'm sitting there kind of just looking at him, just sizing him up. This was one of their earliest operations I had done in my life.

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       It was the first big operation I did in Iraq. And so I'm sort of curious, I guess for lack of a better word, and I'm looking at the people that we had captured. Like I said, I think there's 13 of them and just looking at them, looking at their emotions that they were going through and some of them looks scared, right. In fact, I would say the majority from just look scared, just this is not good and this is a bad situation. And you get that feeling like, okay, this guy is probably not bad and will be released. Some of the guys looked mad, which is understandable to, you know, someone comes into your house in the middle of night and then takes you and you can be mad about that. If you can overcome the scared part. Right. And of course these people had lived under Saddam Hussein, so they'd been through some brutal stuff. And for them to be not afraid was also an understandable thing. Some of the older gentlemen. And then there was one guy though that he looked, he looked different. The look in his eyes, it will definitely wasn't scared, but it wasn't even mad. It was like beyond mad. It was beyond angry. It was beyond a fanatical look. The look that he had in his was evil look like any evil. We could see evil there and I never will forget that that face and I would see that type of face again over the years.

Speaker 1:          00:03:20       Yeah, especially in Iraq, you'd go out and capture someone that was known for doing horrible things and you could tell you need grab five or six people and you'd say, Oh, let me guess which one is the bad guy. And usually wasn't very hard to tell. And then occasionally some of those bad guys would just look, they looked completely evil. They look like sadists, they look like murderers. They, they had the face of evil. You could see it in their eyes. And I was,

Speaker 2:          00:03:54       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:03:55       watching a video recently of a, a young, beautiful young girl, blonde hair, kind of unkempt blonde hair, a little bit wild, and she had a like a constant persistent smile sort of shining on her face. She had young little innocent eyes that were filled with hope.

Speaker 2:          00:04:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:25       And I watched this video and she says in the video she says, my name is Louisa. I'm young lady from Denmark and I have a burning desire to go out into the Arctic. And she's going on kind of describing herself. She says, I'm very enthusiastic about the outdoors and outdoor activities. I'm studying outdoor life, Norway for this same reason. I'm trying to find my dream. She says to go into the Arctic, but sometimes I take some detours before I end up where I want in the video. She's got clips of her in various parts of the world on beaches and in jungles and she's clearly a traveler. And then she says, but I'm still working my way towards the north.

Speaker 2:          00:05:21       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:05:21       a dream that has been stuck in my head and I hope, wish and pray that I can retrieve my dream, our dream of experiencing the feeling of kicking a dog sled through the big Arctic about feeling the ice crystals in my face, in the view of an infinite white landscape. I dream about learning and experiencing the magnificent, untamed Arctic. And the video ends with her picking up snow in her hands and she blows it innocently into the camera lens and she's laughing.

Speaker 2:          00:06:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:15       And then the video fades, but she was not able to fulfill her dream. In fact, she entered a nightmare and didn't return on December 17th, 2018 that girl who made that video, her name was Louisa Jespersen and her friend Marin Youland, another beautiful young lady from Norway. They were browth brutally, brutally murdered by a group of subhuman savages as they camped beside a hiking trail in Morocco. And these despicable in viral people. And I use that term loosely, these, these savages that murdered these two girls actually recorded their disgusting acts and posted them on mine.

Speaker 2:          00:07:33       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:36       They attack these girls. They saw through their throats with butcher knives while they were still alive.

Speaker 2:          00:07:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:49       While they were screaming, while they were gasping for air, while they were begging for mercy and while they were eventually gurgling in their own blood and then fell silent, and one of the murderers put his foot on one of the girls' heads to hold her neck in place while he finished the job of decapitating her.

Speaker 2:          00:08:26       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:08:29       and these sub humans pledged their allegiance to isis and shouted, it's all laws will as they killed these innocent girls.

Speaker 2:          00:08:51       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:08:54       Sick, depraved vial creatures,

Speaker 1:          00:09:07       evil.

Speaker 3:          00:09:12       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:15       Evil does exist. Here's a nother example of evil. I started doing time when I was 11 years old and have been doing practically nothing else since then. What time? I haven't been in jail. I've spent either getting out or getting in again.

Speaker 3:          00:09:44       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:44       I have no desire, whatever to reform myself. My only desire is to reform people who try to reform me, and I believe the only way to reform people

Speaker 3:          00:09:55       is to kill them.

Speaker 1:          00:09:59       In my lifetime, I have murdered 21 human beings. I've committed thousands of burglaries, robberies, larcenies, arsons, and last but not least, I have committed sodomy on more than 1000 male human beings. For all of these things, I am not the least bit, sorry, I have no conscience, so that doesn't worry me.

Speaker 3:          00:10:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:29       I don't believe in man, God nor devil. I hate the whole damn human race.

Speaker 3:          00:10:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:39       Including myself. I prayed upon the week, the harmless and the unsuspecting. This lesson I was taught by others might makes right Carl Pans Ram number three one six one four and that is the opening of a book called Pans. Ram. Journal of a murderer.

Speaker 3:          00:11:18       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:11:19       Carl Pans. Ram was evil. He was institutionalized for most of his life in detention centers and prisons and whatever may have been good about him at one time or another was eventually suffocated. And what was left was pure on mitigated hatred and malevolence. And while he was going through one of his final stance in prison, he made friends with a young prison by the name of Henry Lesser. Then Henry lesser seemed like a very good positive person. Kind of had the ideal of reform. Now people could be helped in his mind, and Henry asked that Pans Ram, right? The story of his life, which, which pans ram did.

Speaker 3:          00:12:19       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:20       Then the notes were save, saved and documented, and there was additional information from various supporting sources surrounding other details of pans, rams, life, and all of that was put together and turned into this book, which though it is a very difficult read.

Speaker 3:          00:12:44       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:45       It's in my opinion, worth reading to gather a better understanding of of human nature and specifically of the capacity for men to commit evil. So again, most of this that I'm going to read from the book is his work, his writing, Carl pans, rems, writing. And here we go. Back to the book. I was born June 28th, 1891 on a small farm in Minnesota. My parents were of German descent, hardworking, ignorant, and poor. The rest of the family consisted of five brothers and one sister, all of whom are dead except three of us brothers and our sister. All of my family are as the average human beings are. They're honest and hardworking people. All except myself. I've been a human animal ever since I was born. When I was very young, at five or six years of age, I was a fief and a liar and the older I got, the meaner I got as fast as the older boys grew up, they also pulled out one died. They, this left me and my sister, one older brother and my mother.

Speaker 3:          00:14:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:09       My sister and I were sent to school during the days and as soon as we came home in the evenings, we were put to work in the fields where my older brother and my mother were always at work from daylight until long after dark. Sometimes my portion of pay consisted of plenty of work and a sound, a beating. Every time I looked cockeyed or done anything that displeased anyone who is older and stronger and Cape and able to catch me and kick me around whenever they felt like it and it seemed to me and still does now that everything was always right for the one who was the strongest and every single thing that I'd done was wrong.

Speaker 3:          00:14:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:44       Everybody said so anyway, but right or wrong, I used to get plenty of abuse. Everybody thought it was all right to deceive me, lie to me, and kicked me around. Whenever they felt like it, then they felt like it pretty regular.

Speaker 2:          00:14:58       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:58       That is the way my life was lived until I was about 11 years old. At about that time, I began to suspect that there was something wrong about the treatment I was getting from the rest of the human race. When I was about 11 years old, I began to hear and see that there were other places in this world besides my own little corner of it. I began to realize that there were other people who live nice, easy lives and were not kicked around and work to death.

Speaker 2:          00:15:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:26       I decided that I wanted to leave my miserable home before I left. I looked around and figured that one of our neighbors who was rich and had a nice home full of Nice things, hat he had too much and I had two little so one night I broke into his home and stole everything to that to my eyes. Had the most value, those things where some apples, some cake and a great big pistol.

Speaker 2:          00:15:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:48       Eating the apples and cake and carrying the pistol under my coat. I walked to the railroad yards where I caught a freight train going to the West where I intended to be a cowboy and shoot Indians, but I must've had my wires crossed because I missed my connection somewhere. Instead of going out and seeing the world, I was caught, brought back home and beaten half to death and sent to jail from there. And from there to the Minnesota state training school at Redwing, Minnesota.

Speaker 2:          00:16:14       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:16:14       right there. And then I began to learn about man's inhumanity to man. So he's off to a rough start and it was his father had left him and I didn't mention that part. Obviously I'm not reading every part of the book, but his father left the family and then it was up to his mom. Sounds like he had the, uh, more than his share of the, the rebellious streak that I think most kids have. And then he shows up at this Minnesota, Minnesota state training school back to the book. When I first went to the Minnesota state trait, the state training school, I was about 12 years old, lively, healthy, and very mischievous, innocent and ignorant. The law immediately proceeded to educate me to be a good, clean, upright citizen and a credit to the human race. They trained me all right in that training school, during my two years, I was trained by two different sets of people to have two different sets of morals. The good people tried to train me to be good and the bad people did train me to be bad.

Speaker 2:          00:17:21       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:22       The method that the good people used in training was to beat goodness into me and all the badness out of me. They'd done their best, but their best wasn't good enough to accomplish what they set out to do. The more they beat me and whipped me, the more I hated them and they're damn religion. Oh yes. We had plenty of church and religion. All right. I used to be pretty ignorant and not able to read very well, so I was always had a hard job learning my Sunday school lessons for failure to learn these lessons. I was given a whipping during the first year I was there. I used to get a beating every Saturday night and sometimes three or four more during the week for doing something I wasn't supposed to do or for not doing something I was supposed to do. Oh yes. I had plenty of abuse. They had various methods of punishing us for doing wrong and for teaching us to do right. The most popular with them was to take us to the paint shop, so called because there they used to paint our bodies black and blue. Naturally. I now love Jesus very much, much.

Speaker 1:          00:18:31       Yes. I love him so damn much that I would like to crucify him all over again.

Speaker 2:          00:18:39       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:41       I was too dumb to learn anything in school, so they took me out and put me to work all day washing dishes and waiting on tables and the officer's dining room right there. I began to get a little revenge on those who abused me when I served some food to the some of the officers I used to urinate in their soup, coffee or tea and masturbate into their ice cream or dessert and then stand right beside them and watch them eat it. They enjoyed it too because they told me so. I wish they could read this. Now the next thing I tried to do as poison that Mr John more by putting rat poison in his rights, rice pudding, but they caught me, beat me, and put me out of the dining room. About that time I began to try and figure out some way to punish those who punished me. The only thing I could figure out was to burn down the building in which the paint shop was located. This I did

Speaker 2:          00:19:39       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:39       I've got a long, thick piece of heavy cotton string wrapped it around and around a long round stick and lit what end of it and hit it in the laundry near some oil soaked rags that night. The whole place burned down in a cost of a hundred over a hundred thousand dollars Nicei some of the boys who were clever than I finally put me wise to how I should perform. If I ever wanted to get out of that joint. They told me to act like I was a very good boy. Tell everybody I met how much I love Jesus and how I wanted to go home and be a good boy. Go to school and learn to be a preacher.

Speaker 2:          00:20:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:17       I done just as they suggested and I'm damned if it didn't work out just as slick as hot grease through a tin horn.

Speaker 2:          00:20:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:25       I was called in before the parole board one day and there I told them all the lies and hot air I could and they gave me a parole and let me go home. In that way, I first found out how to use religion as a cloak of hypocrisy to cover up my rascality. He's

Speaker 3:          00:20:49       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:20:51       Rough way to kick things off. Yeah. But you almost like, you know, you talk about like evil, you almost feel it for him though, are on his side, kind of like, yeah. It won't just beating you up your whole life making just grinding into I'm beating you up. And then like, yes, you're getting it. That's how you feel right now.

Speaker 1:          00:21:10       Yeah. Well it's, it's one of those things that's going to be, you know, yeah. You feel sympathetic for someone and then you as, as that person moves through life, first of all, it's, there's other people that had been through worse things that turn out great and wonderful human beings. And there's other people that go through last that turned out worse. Right. So there's, it's, it's, uh, I'm no psychologists, but there's, there's, it's one of the things that's troubling about this and as you, as you hear what he goes through and when he turns into it's, yeah, it's, it's definitely a challenge. And you know, at the end of the day in, in my opinion, like, hey, you're still responsible for your actions and hey, we get it that you went through some hard things that doesn't give you an excuse to behave in an immoral way. It just doesn't.

Speaker 4:          00:22:16       Yeah, it doesn't, I'm sure that, um, you know, like he, he was saying how he was, you know, pissing in the soup and whatnot. I mean, I'm, I'm assuming those of the people who were like trying to correct them and you know, I'm beating him on staff, the staff of the, of the school where he was being trained at. So I think that's sort of why you're like kind of feeling for them because it's like, oh yeah, you're getting direct revenge on that kind of thing and you're of course you're angry kid. Yeah, of course. What you went through. But then yeah, once you start just taking it out like, oh, let me see an innocent person, I'm mad at them because their life is, and then you kill him or something, then that's when you're going to start to not feel for them. I'm sure.

Speaker 1:          00:22:58       I think. Yeah, I think so too. Yeah. I guess you do get that kind of feeling like all these guys are beating you up now you're getting a little revenge. You could, you could make a positive movie about that. Right? You could make a positive story that you can spin it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, depending on where it goes from there. So right now you're, you're on his side basically basic and back to the book, after serving about two years there, I was pronounced by the Parole Board to be a nice, clean boy. Have good morals as pure as a lily and a credit to those in authority in the, in the instruction where I had been sent to be reformed. Yes, sure. I was reformed. All right. Damn good. And reform too. When I got out of there, I knew all about Jesus and the Bible so much so that I knew it was a lot of hot air.

Speaker 3:          00:23:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:47       But that wasn't all I knew. I had been taught by Christians how to be a hypocrite.

Speaker 3:          00:23:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:52       And I had learned about stealing, lying, hating, burning, and killing from the treatment I received while there and the lessons I learned from it. I had fully decided when I left there, just how I would live my life. I made up my mind that I would rob burn, destroy, and kill everywhere I went and everybody as long as I lived. That's the way I was reformed in the Minnesota state training school. That's the reason why, so that's a little bit more that that's, that's where you have something in his, in his personality, right. There's something, there's plenty of people that went to this school that didn't go do what he did. He made that stair something snapped. Yeah. Where he decided that he was just going to make his life a life of making people suffer. Going on back to the book, I did not want to learn these lessons, but I found out that it isn't what one wants in this world. That one gets force and might make. Right. Perhaps things shouldn't be that way, but that's the way they are. I learned to look with suspicion and hatred on everybody.

Speaker 3:          00:25:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:07       As the years went on, that persisted in my mind. That persisted. That idea persisted in my mind. Above all others. I figured that if I was strong enough and clever enough to impose my will on others, I was right.

Speaker 3:          00:25:21       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:25:21       I still believe that to this day.

Speaker 3:          00:25:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:25:26       So this is just this twisted. Yeah, it's really, it doesn't take long for him. They get pretty twisted.

Speaker 3:          00:25:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:33       In like there's a lesson here of who the lesson that he talks about. If I found out that it isn't in the, what one wants in a world that one gets, it's like that's actually an important lesson. Like you don't always get what you want, but then taking that to say, Hey, if I'm strong enough and I can force my will on things, then I'll get what I want more often.

Speaker 4:          00:25:53       Yeah. And the in that he did say clever enough to, yeah. Which kind of, it's weird cause like a real low, super low level of that still goes on I think with, with a lot of people there, no doubt about it. You know, with justification and you know how like, you know, you'll, you know, you'll, you'll justify things in your head, you know, it'd be like, Oh, you know, when you do something bad, will you do something, you know, is unfair. Even that kind of low level stuff, like it's not hurting no bunch for sure, but it's like maybe not fair or something like that. Then you'd just justify in your head. And you know, like some people they're clever. Like they're smart so they can justify their justifications are way more legit seeming. Cause they're real smart. They can just, you know, yeah. It's kind of like with lawyers, you see the lawyers doing the movie, you know, you paint for someone to be like someone like the,

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       you kind of take things out of context and put other things in context and not supposed to be there kind of thing. And Yeah, you just kind of paint this picture in your own mind why what you're doing is right. And of course in other people's mind too, you know, then you're clever enough, Daniel, you're justifying it yourself and he's, but he's not even talking about that. He doesn't need to justify it to himself. He's doing what he's doing to, to get what he wants. And his use of being clever isn't to justify to himself his use of being clever. It's just to outwit people and take advantage of them. Yeah. Be a con man beyond a con man. And he gets, so he's in and out of prison and he goes back into prison. He gets out of prison. He goes back into present here. At this point, he broke out of prison and he's, he hooks up with a guy named Jimmy Benson. Back to the book. He showed me how to work the stickup racket and how to rob the poor boxes in churches. I in turn taught him how to set fire to a church after we robbed it. We got very busy on that robbing and burning or church regular every chance we got.

Speaker 2:          00:27:46       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:27:46       When we got tired of riding a train because this is their, their uh, you know, hitching on these trains. When we got tired of riding on a train, we used to open up the journal boxes, take out the greasy waste packing and throw in some sand or gravel into it. They wouldn't get far with that car. So they get done riding a train and they just destroy it. They, you know, they ruin the gearboxes. Just general destruction of everything continues in and out of prison. One time he uses drunk and here's a guy talking about the army and ends up enlisting in the army. Back to the book. I was only in the army a month or two when I got three years in u s military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. I had the job of swinging 18 pound hammer in the rock quarry. Most of my bit, my number was 1874 and my name was Karl Pans Ram there. I done 37 months. I done plenty of work and I had plenty of punishment and the only good part of it was that they didn't try to hammer anymore religion. And to me at this time of my life, I was about 20 years old, six foot tall and weighed about 190 pound of concentrated hell fired man inspired meanness. I was strong as two or three average men.

Speaker 2:          00:29:02       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:29:02       I had to be to be able to withstand some of the punishments and labor that I went through during my three years in the u s um,

Speaker 1:          00:29:11       military prison. One of my tasks and punishments while there was to be shackled to a 50 pound iron ball for six months. During that time, I wore the ball and chain day and night, slept with it and work with it on my work was in the rock quarry and that was three miles from the prison. The gang of about 300 convicts and 40 screws used to march out in the morning and back at night. The other men had to carry nothing except themselves. But my part was to load my iron ball, an 18 pound hammer, a pick and shovel, and a six foot iron crowbar all into a wheel barrow and march behind the line of cons out to the Corey and worked there for eight and a half hours in the hot Kansas son busting big rocks, but all of that treatment did one good thing for me. The worst food was, and the harbor, they worked me the stronger I got, I was going to save the, Oh, so he got a good workout and you think, yeah, he's six feet tall, 190 pounds back in, what is it, 1900 or whatever. He's a yolks dude and he's doing all this hardcore physical labor and yeah, he's turning into a very scary dude.

Speaker 3:          00:30:23       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:30:25       Back to the book. I was discharged from prison in 1910 by the way, can you imagine? You're in the army for a couple months and you get put in the Leavenworth for three years.

Speaker 1:          00:30:39       I was the spirit of meanness personified. I had not at this time got so that I hated myself. I only hated everybody else before I left there. I Sung on the same old song and gave him the same line about how I sure love Jesus and what a nice young man I was and how much good I it had done me to be sent to that prison. I don't know if they believe me or not, but they all said they did anyway. They all declared that I was pure as a Lilly and free from sin.

Speaker 1:          00:31:12       Again, there are so a bunch of traveling, there's a bunch of coffee. He's a constant criminal and he, there's another thing we realize back in this day and the reason he named, he said, oh, at this time I was Carl Pans Ram is because he changes his name a bunch because that's what just what you would do back then if you a criminal and there's no electronic tracking system, there's no phone numbers, no cell phone. There's not even a fault with like phones and everyone's houses so you can get away with murder quite literally. And he does, but he, he, he's maybe not the best criminal as well because he gets caught a lot, you know, for robbing and stealing and part of it's cause cause he has like a, doesn't care it, so he gets put, he gets arrested at different time. He gets put into a chain gang and he eventually breaks away from escapes the chain gang and then he goes from continuing skipping trains and ends up with an Indian guy and they work together as a little team and they rob a guy and here we go back to the book of the Indian, tied him up first he took off his belt, pulled his pants down to below his knees and tied his legs together.

Speaker 1:          00:32:20       Then he tied his hands behind his back. Then he tied his hands to his feet, pulled together. Then he stuffed a sock in his mouth and tied a handkerchief tied over that and then tied them to a tree. He was in ready to leave him and walk away. But I wasn't through yet. I figured while I had such a good chances that I would commit a little sodomy on him. This I proceeded to do

Speaker 1:          00:32:48       and he mentioned at one point that he, he hooked up with a girl and got some kind of vd and then he was like, oh girls, they're dirty. And so that's why he goes after guys. Now back to the book at at night, while I was riding the freight trains, I was always on the lookout for something to shoot or trying to stick up the Hobos that I met on the trains. I looked them all over and whenever I met one who wasn't too rusty looking, I would make him raises hands and drop his pants. I wasn't very particular either. I rode them old and young, tall and short, white and black. It made no difference to me.

Speaker 3:          00:33:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:33:37       Some months later I was pinched at Chinook Montana for burglary.

Speaker 1:          00:33:44       I quick took a plea of guilty and got one year at the state prison at deer lodge, Montana. When I got there, I met my old partner, Jimmy Benson, who was doing 10 years for robbery. I stayed there about eight months in escaped he, he's also good at escaping escapes all these things all the time. A week later I was arrested in three forks, Montana for burglary under the name of Jeff Rhodes. I pleaded guilty and got a year and was sent back to deer lodge where I was at once, brought to court and given one year for my escape under the name Jeff Davis. Out of these three sentences, I served 23 months in that prison. There was only work for a few men and I wasn't one of those. All the cells were for two men in each cell. Each man could choose his own cell mates and get a new one anytime he wanted. I used to want a new one pretty regular at that place and time I got to be an experienced wolf. I knew more about sodomy than old boy Oscar Wilde ever thought of knowing. I would start in the morning with sodomy, work as hard as, as hard at it as I could all day and sometimes half the night. I was so busy committing sodomy that I didn't have time left to serve Jesus as I had been taught to in those reforms schools.

Speaker 1:          00:35:06       He gets out of that prison. As soon as I got to Oregon and gets put in another prison, I got to, as soon as I got to Oregon State prison, I was in more trouble. I swore I would never do the seven years and defied the warden and all his officers to make me gets put in solitary confinement. Here we go. In solitary confinement, there are coolers and coolers. Some are bad and some are worse. None are good. Some are cold and wet, some are hot and dry. Some you freeze and others you roast and sweat in all you are hungry and thirsty and filthy and in some you stay a day or there's a week and there have been times when I've been in the cooler a month or more. Bread and water isn't very nourishing and neither does it generate clean thinking in a person's mind. The milk of human kindness generally curdles and turns into sour under such conditions. The more cooler you get, the more heat and hate there is in your heart. In every joint I was ever in, there was always some form of torture that was on tap. I usually got my share of every kind there was. I've had them all at one time or another and then he goes on through a bunch of different

Speaker 1:          00:36:19       torture that they would use on these prisoners from like straight jacket type things. There's something called the snorting Pole, which is a post about 12 feet long. You get basically tied to it. You get whipped back to the book. When the lash begins to take away, little bits of hide in, the blood begins to run. Then the soccer begins to jerk and Yelp and snort. That's why it's called the snorting pole. When a man is let down after being whipped, he has blood on his back and murder in his heart.

Speaker 1:          00:36:56       That's, that's all about the snorting Paul. There's a bat and the paddle, there's, here's this thing, the restraint machine, the restraint machine, bare footed, standing on a cold damp concrete floor, backed up to an iron bar door, hands behind, cuffed to the door, a large belt under my arms, around my chest, pulled tight to the door, standing in that position for four hours, then let down for one hour to eat my bread and water. Then four hours more than to bed, which was a board, no blankets in the morning, bread and water, and then four hours more and so on for a stretch of anywhere from five to 14 days. That was the limit. That's your restraint machine you've ever, okay. I know you're claustrophobic, right? Sure. Yeah. I mean you are, but sometimes I don't. I don't think I'm claustrophobic, but sometimes I want to move a limb.

Speaker 1:          00:37:49       Right. You know what I'm saying? Well, yeah, and for instance, you're on a plane and you're all tight and in economy seat up against the bulkhead and there's like, it's tight. Yeah. You know that part of the plane towards the back where the, the, the, the bulkhead kind of curves in. So you're even losing a little bit more space. Yeah. And you just want to move. Yeah. You know, but you can't cause the seatbelt light just went on. Yes. Now imagine doing four hours like that for 14 days. Four hours. Twice a day for 14 days. Yeah. That's horse shit. Yeah. That's actually real harsh. So there's like two and t to Sam Club. Cause claustrophobia usually is like, you know Lee,

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       you go in an elevator and you feel it. That kind of, you know, I don't, I don't have it like that, but yeah, maybe I'm a little bit more sensitive to those kinds of scenarios. Side control, claustrophobia. Well you know I used to, yes. But this is more what it is to put accurately. Did I email you? Healed me? Yeah. Actually what it was. So it's like he, I just got in better shape. That's all. Cause like it wasn't, it was the idea that if I'm like tired and I won't be able to get out of here, like I'm stuck here forever, I'm going to die here. That's the feeling you get. But when I wasn't tired, I'm like, oh no, I can cruise down here. I just, I don't know. It just felt like it was better

Speaker 5:          00:39:14       the last time we rolled. Didn't you have a little issue down there?

Speaker 4:          00:39:17       No. Are you sure? Yes. I don't remember having any issue recently. Probably like year. It's been years, but that's the feeling is what it is. So, but here's the, when I got an MRI on my arm, you tap to something the other day. That's not a tapping offense. I forget what it was. It was your that that forum on my throat. Oh, I remember. It was like I couldn't, it was too like you did it too hard for me to have time to figure out, okay, I can turn this way or what a to relieve the pain. You did it too fast. I did it with like a little extra, like a little, yeah. It wasn't like a striker or nothing like that. But yeah, it was like I would've gotten, my throat would have got injured if I will.

Speaker 5:          00:40:02       Took more time. Thanks for that. By the way, I had a MRI on my, Oh, you're selling that tube. Yeah. So which is fine if you're just in a comfortable position. It can be when you open your eyes and you look how freaking tube is, like inches in front of your face and you're in there. Yeah, I can kind of Jammy all, but you just close your eyes and be like, oh, that'll be, claustrophobia is a big deal in the, in the seal teams especially cause you had to lock out of the sub submarine chambers, which isn't in the old days, it was a submarine chamber that wasn't built for seals to lock out of. It was built for an escape hatch. If there's an emergency on the submarine lockout, you're underwater in a submarine. Yeah. And you go into a little chamber and then once you're in a little chamber, it fills with water, equalize to the outside and then the door opens up and you can swim out.

Speaker 5:          00:40:55       That's called the lockout chamber. And we used to do that and uh, there's still, we still do it, but like it's a little bit more of a specialized group that does that now. But it used to just be a general thing for good for if you were in the day and he would do that. And I mean it can definitely cause you're in there with equipment as long a while it would take a long time to get ahold of seal squad out. Like what? Like what's a wild boy? You'd be, you'd be in that little chamber, uh, for probably 15 minutes at a time. But here's the thing, you're in there, there's two major situations going on. Number one, you're not just in there, you're in there with like one or two other guys. Yeah. But you're also sitting there with equipment, so got bags of weapons, waterproof weapons.

Speaker 5:          00:41:38       You actually have your boats in there and there. So it's all tight and here's, here's what would really freak out. So the water starts to fill, it starts to fill up, and then as it's filling up, it gets to a point where you got to keep it equal as, and you're using these little pressure valves. One, you basically crank a valve that pushes air into the chamber, and so that pushes the water down. If you're not good, then you're going to mess up the pressure. And it's called losing the bubble cause there's a bubble of air that you're just sitting there breathing. If you don't equalize the pressure, well then that bubble of just keeps going up and then you lose the bubble. The bubble is gone, which I think is where the w that's what I always thought. Losing the bubble. And you've heard that term, right?

Speaker 5:          00:42:27       No. Okay. When someone says, oh, he's losing the bubble. You've never heard that before? No. Well, we would say, and I've heard it, I've heard a civilian say it too, so I'm pretty sure that it's, yeah, but I think that that's where it came from. It's like, Oh, you're losing the bubble. And I've been in the chamber when someone lost the bubble and I remember I was telling the guy, I was like, Hey, you're losing the bubble, you're losing the bubble. He wasn't about, and then I'm underwater. And then you've got to find the, you've got to find the octopus, which is the regulator of which you have, you have air tanks just in there, like compressed air tanks, like scuba tanks that are strapped to the wall just in case someone loses the bubble. But did you got to find, they've got a chem light on a red cam lights and you just dig, dig around and go and grab the red cow.

Speaker 5:          00:43:08       Might you find your thing, you start breathing and you find the valve and you crank it and then the bubble comes back. But yeah, you, if you're claustrophobic in that situation is going to be problematic. Big. Huge. Yeah. Cause it's just the expression on your face at this time. She tells me that you would not, how big was it? How big is the chambers? It's smaller than the area that you and I are sitting, right? Yeah. Yeah. So my Mri for my Bicep, I had to go like this, like my hand up in the air. Well you know, I'm laying down so it's not up in the air, but like, so you're not laying, laying regular, one hand is up. Okay. And for 15 minutes in that little teeny tiny tube, like how you're saying I could lay on my bed like that. They sedate you or anything.

Speaker 5:          00:43:54       You just dealt with it? Yeah. This is how had a few Mris in my time, but I just relaxed her, went in there, no big deal. I didn't lose the bubble. I do. No, no, no, no. The thing is I did it. Well, here's the thing. So this is what I really admitted to myself. Okay. I have like a little, um, sensitivity to it. Um, he's like, okay, you got to put your arm up cause it, you know, and you can't move. So I'm thinking, man, I can just lay it on my bed like this all day. I'll sleep like that, you know, but why am I super like nervous about this? So I go in and he's putting me in and I feel my heart just started beating real fast, like full on. I'm like, oh man. But um,

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       but I mentally push through it like the kind of, I feel like not even a minute, but maybe like 30, 45 seconds. I'm like, ah, you know, watch guys cave diving. Like what do you mean? No? Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're done underwater. But it's an underwater cave. Yeah. And you're diving that can get a little tight. Yeah. So, and I, we um, I'm quiet. It was a place called the blue room and it's that, and here's the thing. So it's basically a cave. You walk up this mountain maybe like, I don't know, 50, 50 yards, maybe up a mountain. And you go, well, no, no, the mountain is huge. You just walked up 50 hours. Then there's a cake. That's where the cave is and you're going in the cave and depending on, you know, how much it rained or whatever, there's a little lake in the caves.

Speaker 4:          00:45:20       Really cool. We used to always go at the back of the cave is a little teeny tiny hole, teeny tiny pool. If the water's too high and it covers that whole, it's still a hole, but it's, you got to go under water. So at the end of that it basically, that whole is a hallway that you swim through. You can't touch the bottom. It's like you swim through this little hallway and it goes and it curves. This is maybe maybe a 2020 yards day and not 20 that's, that's you know, maybe 10 in the dark though. And the only light is glowing, bright blue light that the water creates from the sun that shines in the water and kind of reflects up. It's really, it's really nice. But yeah, if you have an issue with that, especially if the other side, what do you, it's a big room it now that's another thing.

Speaker 4:          00:46:07       Open to the light. The light from the water lights up the room. So it's, it's, yeah, it's really weird. That's why you kind of go cause it's really awesome. The thing is, there's nothing to hold on to your treading water in that room. So it's like, oh, the rum room is deep water. Yeah. You get in touch. It's a huge lake in there, you know, so you can't touch the bottom at all. And um, but if the water level is high enough where that cave or the, the hallway we'll call it, it's like this, you know, where you can just barely to, it gets like, oh, this is kind of nerve wracking for sure. But sometimes it's real low and it's cool you just swim through. But if it's like your first time or you have a little bit of Claustrophobia in water like that, you'll, it'll jam you up for sure.

Speaker 4:          00:46:48       But I never had a problem with Alan. It's that, it's what you said when you know you can't move. Yeah. But if you know you can move so you can just stay there. It's weird. It's like a psychological thing, you know? Yeah, no, but yeah, it's, you know, I get that every once in a while on the plane to the restraint machine. So I guess that would be really effective against some people that have a little claustrophobia or they, the thing is though, okay, let's say all of these methods are bad, right? Let's say all these methods of reform are bad. I feel good about saying that. Yes. Okay. And then you say, okay, if I was in that situation, I do everything

Speaker 5:          00:47:30       I could to get out of the scenario where like okay I got arrested and I got put in there straight machine and I got the beat with a paddle and I got all those things happen. We get, so you know what I'm going to do is try and trying to stay clean a little bit. Right. Get on, maybe get on a little bit of a of a path. A better path. Yes sir. It didn't work at all at all. He didn't care. Yeah. Well it kind of makes sense that like when, what did he say and went after the snorting pole or whatever. Like Whoa, you just fill out the hatred and murder in your mind. Yeah. That seems like, cause even the claustrophobia thing on the, on the, what's that called, the restraints situation. Four hours every like every session, all day. You know, like after awhile you're like you're going to get used to that or you're going to go so nuts that you're just going to faint or I dunno, something like that.

Speaker 5:          00:48:19       Either way there's a part of your mind I would think. I don't know. That's just what it feels like listening to it. I feel like I would just be so nuts at the end. Like oh like I wouldn't care about that restraint thing. I would just care about like murdering person or something. I could see how that could go. Yeah. I mean I personally wouldn't go that way. I'll probably try not to go there anymore, but that's just me. Yeah. So maybe as a reform or if you cross the line and you make someone snap, now you're no longer being productive. This is true with your kids then. Maybe you haven't experienced this yet, but you can like push your kids to a point where they don't care. Like yeah, I'll take this away. I'll take this away and then all of a sudden they go, I don't care.

Speaker 5:          00:49:01       Take it. They throw their tour. You know the tours that you're threatening, they throw it at you. Take it, remember the breakfast club. Remember that movie? I do remember, I remember that Guy John Bender, what it was Israel, I forget the actor's name, but anyway, I'm just trying to play bender is his name and he's like guys which carry the bad guy, the bad kid. Okay. And he's really, and he's like, um, he's like, hey, did Barry Manilow radio or did you would read very mental. It was wardrobe. And he's like, I'll give you the answer to that, uh, next Saturday saying like, you got another detention, you're next day. And then, then he says something else. He goes, then you get another Saturday. And he's like, well, I'm free though. Soda. You know, he did that. He was after, I was like, I don't care. He's like, and then he's holding up the horn, two months vendor, I got two months. Those good, a good part there. So yes, you can't push it too far. And obviously from a leadership perspective, we'll just go for a little leadership perspectives here. There are things you can do to the people that work for you where they won't care anymore. Yeah, and now you, now you're done. You have, you've lost control. You've lost control over them, so don't do that.

Speaker 5:          00:50:11       He talks about this electric, electric shock to they called the hummingbird first, an ordinary steel bathtub with in which four or five inches of ice cold water. The victim is laid down in there and chained hand and foot. Then the chief torture enters the scene. He's dressed in ordinary clothes and old and

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       has only a rubber slicker and a pair of rubber gloves on his hands and his hands. He holds a common sponge. The sponge is connected to electric battery by wires. The switch is turned on and the torture advances on the victim. He first begins on the soles of the feet by gently rubbing the charge sponge there and then gradually working his way up to the body and to the head of the sensations of to the victim or that there seems to be millions of red hot needles sticking into them. The agony is intense two or three minutes and the victim is ready for the grave or the madhouse. Yet there is not a single mark or bruise on his whole body. A physician stands beside this is sick. The physician stands beside the victim and every few seconds feels the pulse and examines him. When he judges that the victim is exactly on the verge of madness or death, he gives the signal to switch off the current than the victim is thrown into a cell where he left for a few days or weeks.

Speaker 4:          00:51:28       Yeah, that's weird. The sponge, how they put the sponge there like on lethal weapon one he got, he got rigs with that mirror and I remember that's what it made me think of when you had the, the sponges and he's in the shower. I'll tie it up like that. He keeps like hitting him. He hit him again. Yeah, those sponges. I wonder what that that's about though. The sponge, it conducts electricity, water, water conducts the direct mark. It's just hitting you with like a big shock pillow of shock.

Speaker 1:          00:52:04       Uh, continues on. He gets it, eventually gets out of that prison and any actually broke out of that prison. And then he's now he's just on like full crime mode. I don't even know what goes beyond crime mode, but just full stealing, raping, murdering swindling. He steals enough money. He works on a bunch of different boats and eventually steels enough money to buy a yacht. So he's bought a yacht and I don't know how big the yacht was, but it wasn't small. And here we go back to the look on my yard. I had quarters for five people, but I was alone for a while. Then I figured it would be a good plan to hire a few sailors to work for me, get them out on my yacht, get them drunk, commits sodomy on them, robbed them and killed them. This I done every day or two.

Speaker 1:          00:52:54       I would get plenty of blues, booze by robbing other yachts there. The Barbara too was one of them. I robbed her. Does nurse, so others around there. I was hitting the booze pretty hard myself at that time. Every day or two I would go to New York and hang around 25th street and size up the sailors. Whenever I saw a couple of who were about my size and seem to have money, I would hire them to work on my yacht. I would always promise them big pay and easy work. What they got was something else. I would take them and their clothes and gear out to my yacht at city island. There we would go and whine and dine and when we, when they were drunk enough, I would go to bed or they would go to bed. When they were asleep, I would get my 45 Colt automatic army pistol. This I stole from Mr [inaudible] House and blow their brains out. Then it would take out a rope and tie a rock on them and put them into my robot. Rowboat, rolled them out in the main channel about one mile and drop him overboard.

Speaker 1:          00:53:54       They are there yet 10 of them. I worked at racket for about three weeks.

Speaker 1:          00:54:04       We eventually gets on another ship, loses that kind of gets people are suspect. He goes, gets on a ship to Europe from Europe. He goes to Africa in Africa. He buys a girl. I paid a big price for her. I bought her from her mother and father for about $8 in American money. The reason I paid such a big price for hers was because she was a virgin. Yeah, so she said she was about 11 or 12 years old. I took her to my shack the first night and took her back to her father's and shack. The next I demanded my money back because they had deceived me by saying the girl was a virgin. I didn't get my money back, but they gave me another younger girl. This girl was about eight years old. I took her to my shack and maybe she was a virgin, but it didn't look like it to me. I took her back and quit looking for any more virgin. I look for a boy. I found one. He was our table waiter. I educated him into the art of sodomy as practiced by civilized people, but he was only a savage and didn't appreciate the benefits of civilization. He told my boss and the boss man fired me quick, but before he did, I licked the hell out of them.

Speaker 1:          00:55:18       The boy, 11 or 12 came bombing. Another boy about 11 or 12 came bumming around. He was looking for something. He found it too. I took him out to a gravel pit about a quarter mile from the main camp of the sing clear oil company. I left him there, but first I committed sodomy on him and then kill them. His brains were coming out of his ears when I left him and he will never be any debtor. He is still there.

Speaker 1:          00:55:50       He ends up murdering another six people in Africa on a boat. He chartered a canoe and then kills everyone in it and then signs onto a ship that's heading back to New York. That was the summer of 1922 he arrives back in America back to the book in Salem, Massachusetts. I'm murdered in 11 or 12 year old boy by beating his brains out with a rock. I tried a little sodomy on him first I left him laying there with his brains coming out of his ears. Went down towards New York robbing and hell raising as I came in January or February of 1923 I got a job as a watchman at two 20 Yonkers avenue, Yonkers, New York. While there I met a young boy of 14 or 15 or his name was George and whose home was in was an is in Yonkers. I started to teach him the fine art of sodomy, but he had, but I found he had been taught about it all and he liked it fine. I kept him with me until I left that job of night in April of 1923 the kid, George got scared and I let him go home to Yonkers. When he got there, he told the police all he knew about me, which wasn't much, but it was enough for the cops to come looking for me. They caught me and my yacht at Nyack, they took me boat and all my plunger to Yonkers jail. They're charged me with sodomy, burglary, robbery and trying to break jail there.

Speaker 3:          00:57:17       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:57:17       in and out again a few days. He gets out. A few days later I went to new haven where I killed another boy. I committed a little more sodomy on him and then tied his belt around his neck and strangled him, picked him up where he was when he was dead and through his body over behind some bushes. Eventually he does his time. He gets trial for the, uh, sodomy burglary and robbery, pleads guilty and immediately given the limit of the law, five years at once I was sent to sing sing and then from sing sing he gets sent to another prison called Dan and Mora, which is a notorious, notorious prison, says in the book of all the prisons, Dana Maura was the one and only designed specifically to punish.

Speaker 1:          00:58:12       And so now this gets really interesting because he's in this really bad prison does, and there's a description that's not from him that's just part of the book, part of the information in the book, talking about Dana Maura and how bad it is there. And then he's done a whole this heinous, I mean, just heinous acts that he should be killed for it over and over again. And here he is. Um, going back to the book, I attempted to escape. I failed in my attempt, but in doing so, I fell about 30 feet to a concrete walk, breaking both my ankles, both my legs, fracturing my spine, and rupturing myself in this condition, I was carried to the prison hospital where I leave for five days and was carried out and dumped into a cell without any medical or surgical attention, whatever. My broken bones were not set, my ankles and legs were not put into a cast.

Speaker 1:          00:59:04       In fact, nothing was done except give me a bottle of Lindemann, which I would have done, which would have done no good if I had been able to rub it on myself. The doctor never came near me and no one else was allowed to do anything for me in that condition. I was left for eight months. At the end of the time, the bones had knitted together. I could stagger around on a pair of crutches, so it's like he's complaining about his maltreatment, right? I got injured and they didn't take care of me. It's like, hey bro. Yeah, you don't get any good treatment.

Speaker 1:          00:59:38       At the end of 14 months of constant agony, I was taken to the hospital where I was operated on for my rupture and one of my testicles was cut out five days after my operation. I tried to see if my sexual organs were still in good order. I got caught trying to commit sodomy on another prisoner for that. I was thrown out of the hospital and dumped into a cell where I suffered more agony for many months, always in pain, never a civil answer from anyone. Always a smaller a cursor allying hypocritical promise, which was never kept crawling around like a snake with a broken back seething with hatred and a lust for revenge. Five years of my life of this kind.

Speaker 2:          01:00:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:12       The last two years and four months confined in isolation with nothing to do except brood upon what I thought the wrong, what I fought was the wrongs that had been done to me, not allowed to receive letters or visits from friends. When the prison inspectors came to investigate conditions and complaints, they were told I was a degenerate, that I suffered from delusions, that I was insane. So they would pay no attention to me or anything that I or anyone else ever complained of.

Speaker 2:          01:00:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:38       This went on for all of my five years and the more they misused me, the more I was filled with the spirit of hatred and revenge. I was so full of hate that there was no room in me for such feelings as love, pity, kindness, or honor or decency. I hated everyone. I saw,

Speaker 4:          01:00:56       uh, again, it's a guy that t he only sees the pain that's been caused to him, but apparently doesn't see any of the pain that he's caused. Anybody else? Zero. Empathy, zero. Then it's sort of, could it seem, or could it happen like this with him where, you know, when he's young he gets beat down. [inaudible] obviously not shown much affection. That's, that's the assumption obviously, but beat down. So now he has this hatred, so now he inflicts pain on quote Unquote Others. Mm. Right. Because of the hatred he has or whatever. So it's kind of like him kind of what getting event for sure. Lack of a better term. So he gets even and then he gets punished for that. Right. Obviously because he can't commit crimes like that. So he gets punished. So now he thinks it's an uneven now, hey, you know? Yeah. It's just the feeling.

Speaker 4:          01:01:46       He's not like, yes. So now he's like, oh, now that now me being punished for what I did by the way, but me being punished has given me even more hate. Now I got to, you know, seek vengeance for that. Then he does it. Then of course he gets and he just keeps doing it. So it's like this cycle. Well, the, there's another cycle here and the cycle is he's blaming everyone else for the situation that isn't blaming everyone and at a certain point, sure, let's, let's blame that first state penitentiary that he was in when he was a kid. The state school let, let's put some blame on them. Okay. Yeah. But you got

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       out of that and you had another opportunity to get on the right path and, and then you, what do you do? You just blame, blame, blame, blame, blame. And the more you're blaming other people, do you put yourself into a downward spiral that he's never going to get out of, obviously. Yeah, they need, now he's blaming. He blames the whole human race. I mean, let's, it's, it's real easy just to sorta s he only writes about it for three sentences, but like, oh, oh, in new haven I raped and murdered an 11 year old boy. Yeah. Like, no, you don't get any mercy now. And you can't blame anyone else for doing that. That's no one else's fault you did that. Yes.

Speaker 6:          01:03:01       Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:03:03       But in his mind, the o for shake, you know how like when you hate, let's say you flick your friend on the head joking around, right? You flip them on the head, you don't care. Then your friends liked to be interested in friends, like, hey, that was kind of heart, you know, so, so he'd like flicks you an escalation for a hard and you're like, Hey, I did flick you on the head that hard. So you smack them, you know? And it turns into this big fight and who's who's, who's to blame, right? Yeah. Both guys feel like, Hey, I flick y'all just joking. You didn't have to flick me that hard. The other guy like, why'd you flick me in the first place? You don't kind of thing. So, and I'm not saying that that's what happened, but in his mind that's probably what it feels like. Oh for sure. That's what it feels like for sure. That's what it feels like. And we all can feel like that at one time or another. We think, oh, it's this person's fault, it's that person's fault. It's my parents. It's the school system.

Speaker 1:          01:03:50       It's the whatever. It's society. Yeah, right. It's society. Yeah. It's every other human being like that's where he's at right now. He hated everyone I saw. Yeah. That's where he's at. It's like he's the victim and he's the victim and just listened to. I mean, it's so clear when he's talking about all these medical problems that he, he's the victim. He's the victim. Whereas if he would've just swapped his attitude early on and said, okay, what about what's happening right now? Even the first, why did he, why did he get sent to the state penitentiary or to the state school system? Because he stole a gun, ran away, but it ripped it ripped off a family of their stuff. Like, Oh, if you do that, you go to prison. But he didn't see that this is fault. That wasn't his fault. He did that because he was living in a bad home. It's like, okay, at some point you have to take ownership of what's going on in your world and you can't just continually blame other people. If you do eventually, you know who's at fault, everyone in the world, but you.

Speaker 6:          01:04:49       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04:51       It's true, so let's not get there. I'll tell you what, it was a pretty good transition for when I joined the navy. That's one thing that I've talked about how when I joined the navy tech, a clean slate, you know what I mean? Like it doesn't matter what you did and that was a really positive thing for me because all of a sudden, and it's a very cause and effect when you're going through like Navy boot camp or any kind of boot camp, any kind of military indoctrination, if you don't do what you're supposed to do, you get punished for it. If you do what you're supposed to do, you either a don't get punished at a minimum or you get some type of reward and it's all set up that way purposely, but it's very easy. It was very easy for me to comprehend as an 18 year old kid going, Oh, if I, if I do this right, I will be rewarded.

Speaker 1:          01:05:37       If I do this wrong, I will be punished. This is on me and then what you read. Then the next thing that they build on top of that is if I let my team do something wrong, we will all get punished. If we do things correctly. We will receive at a minimum, no punishment and possibly some type of reward. It was very easy for me to assemble those pieces in my young brain. And let's face it, when you're 18 years old, I mean my brain wasn't all that develops, right? I mean like physiologically speaking, the Ma, like what does it, the male frontal cortex isn't fully formed until they're like 25 right? Didn't you tell me that? Yes. Yeah, so there you go. So there I was 18 and I yet was able to figure out, okay, wait a second, if I do this, it's on me.

Speaker 1:          01:06:28       If I get punished, it's my fault. If our team gets punished and, and again, that's a, that's a little jump there to kind of bring you through that little phase of like, okay, we get, now you're responsible for you. You understand that. And once you understand, that's like, okay, now you're responsible for your team. And some people don't make that transition. Some people, you know within the team, oh, it wasn't my fault. He was Jimmy's fault. Right. And as you stay in the military longer or as you go in any workforce, eventually you realize, okay, if we don't, if I don't work as a team, we're all going to get punished. So I needed help. The team, he's not learning any of this. That helped me was awful.

Speaker 1:          01:07:11       Back to the book and my whole mind was bent on figuring out ways to annoy and punish my enemies and everybody was my enemy. I had no friends. That was the frame of mind I was in when my five years was up and I was turned loose to go anywhere I wanted to go. My intention was to rob rape and kill everybody. I could anybody and everybody, and he goes through these long kind of plans of putting bombs in inside of tunnels and and w how to get a gas mask and he's be used poison gas and he's going to steal so much money and then with this, with this bunch of money that he was going to get from robbing all these people in in these plot that he has with that, he says with unlimited funds in my hands, I then intended to steal millions of dollars and killed millions of people.

Speaker 1:          01:07:59       This I intended to do by starting a war between England and the USA. Sounds fantastic. All right, but I'm positive he could have done it. He goes through his whole plot of how he was going to make that happen. He was going to bomb a British ship that was, you know, like here peacefully bomb it and make it look like America did it when diplomatic relationship for we're already strained. That was his plant. Hmm. That's crazy. I used to spend all my time for, you're not high. Could murder the most people with the least harm and expense to myself. And I finally thought of a way to kill off the whole town. Men, women, children, and even cats and dogs. And he goes through another big plan about using arsenic and, and dead hogs and put them in the water swim. He goes through like detailed plants,

Speaker 2:          01:08:45       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:47       Now this was some interesting, his perception of what it was like. He's back in jail again. Um, and I forget what for this time, but for all this crap that he's doing all the time, all these crimes he's committing back to the book of the underworld code is very simple. It is never squeal. Don't be a stool pigeon. A rat on informer. All crooks want everybody else to believe that they are. Square cops are the same. They all wish everybody else to think they act from principle. They are always telling everyone they meet about how much principal they have. It is against their principal to do this or that. The queer part of it is that they not only want others to believe this, but they believe it themselves.

Speaker 1:          01:09:34       But the real truth of the matter is that they deceive themselves and mistake policy for principle, when crooks are square with anyone, it is because it is for their own interest to be so it is good policy when it ceases to be in their own interest to square with another one, then it becomes time to change their tactics and they aren't slowing doing it either. It makes no difference to them who they snitch on, no matter if they had been loyal to each other through a whole lifetime as partners and friends, no matter if they send their friends to prison or to hell by way of rope or chair, that cuts no ice. They are looking out for their own precious skins.

Speaker 1:          01:10:22       No, this is a guy also that doesn't trust anybody. So, and that's actually what he said. I mean certainly that's theirs. You can't say that about it. You can say that about a lot of people, but there's all kinds of criminals that never give up. The never, never given him his names, never rat on anybody else. And they get the book thrown at him and they take it back. The book every child has, this is interesting. Every child has some criminal tendencies. It is your place to correct those traits and teach them the right way to live while they are young and they're minds are forming. Then when they do the reach, the age of reason and action, it will be quite natural for them to live clean, upright, honorable lives. In that way, you will stop crime at its source before it begins as a child, a child is very easily led. Any child of properly taught will live the way he is taught to live. All criminals are merely overgrown children. It is in your hands to make us or break us. We buy our own efforts are failures in life simply because we don't know any better. We don't know how to live decent, upright lives. Hereditary heredity has very little to do with the shaping of our lives. The main causes of why we are what we are is because of our improper teaching, lack of knowledge and our environment.

Speaker 1:          01:11:50       Every man's philosophy is colored by his environment. If you don't want us to rob rape and murder you than it is your place to see that the mental and moral misfits are properly taught, a sufficient amount of useful insensible knowledge to put their proper to and put into the proper environment where they can be best fitted to exist in life.

Speaker 5:          01:12:10       So there you go. The nature, nurture, argument, pans, Ram, all, all nurture. It's all how you're raised. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:12:19       It goes on. I was born a normal human being. My parents were ignorant and through their improper teachings and improper environment, I was gradually led into the wrong way of living. Little by little from Brat, bad to worse. I was sent to reform school at age 11 from that day to this, all of my life has been lived among moral and mental misfits. All my associates, all my surroundings, the atmosphere of deceit, treachery brutality, degeneracy, hypocrisy and everything that is bad and nothing that is good. It is unnatural that I should have absorbed these things and I've become what I am today. A treacherous, degenerate, brutal, savage, human devoid of all decent feeling. Absolutely. Without conscience, moral pity, sympathy principal, or any single good trait. Why am I what I am? I'll tell you why I did not make myself what I am. Others had the making of me

Speaker 5:          01:13:24       everyone else's fault, and I'm not in the power to control it. Right? I mean, at this point he recognizes what he is, but he doesn't make any effort to reform himself. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of those two, like even with extreme ownership, right? When you're working with a team, when you say it's easy to blame others and especially when it is their fault at certain times, it's like their fault that this happened to, that happened. It's like a philosophy, right? It's like an approach. It's a certain approach where you say, okay, you know, whatever their fault that this happened or whatever. It's really hard to up with a situation

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       when you're a leader of a team and it's the teams fault.

Speaker 4:          01:14:14       Yeah. I haven't been able to come up with one lately and to say it's, maybe you can, that's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is it is, well, okay, we'll go with this guy. Oh, guidance from a guy on Twitter. Yeah. He said, hey man,

Speaker 1:          01:14:31       why are you giving all this hate to machine gunners shooting outside their field of fire? Because I use that example a lot. Yeah. Hey, the machine gunner shoots off the outside of his field of fire. That's the machine gunners fault, right? No. And I said, dude, hey man, I don't hate machine gunners. I hate the officer's that blame the machine gunner when the machine gunner doesn't know where he's supposed to be shooting that thought machine gunners fault. That's your fault boss. Yeah. So so continue on about the situation

Speaker 4:          01:14:55       trying to refer to, so I, this is like a typical little thing that I'll hear from people. It's like wow, you know, sometimes I got to take ownership even though it's really, that's what you think you're wrong. Yeah, no, no raw. Okay. Gag. I dig it. But cause because right now I'm not saying about whose fault it is and that's not, that's not the point I'm trying to make. It's more that he's right. It is because of them. Like they or the way his parents raised him did cause him to be like this. It caused him to be like this and it cause him to be hit. Like it didn't like his parents raising them didn't make him, you know, sodomized that kid or whatever. He didn't, they didn't make him do it, but their rate of the way they raised him caused him just cause it effect straight up caused him to be like that quote unquote no, it's his fault.

Speaker 4:          01:15:45       Yes. It's his fault that he's doing all these things, you know, cause you can just not, you can not do it. That's possible to just not do it that day or add or whatever. So yeah. As far as fault and blaming, yes. Okay. You're going Sam Harris Freewill on me. Well see the thing is, I mean I guess what I'm saying is like if you don't grow into lack of freewill yeah. Lack of freewill. No, well not necessarily. I'm just basically isolating the blaming part of it and then the cause and effect part of it, you know, kind of thing. Because in that case he's, he's right. Like there what he's saying is correct. As long as he's not saying and it's their fault and it's not my fault. I'm not, you know who he is saying that? Yes. Okay, so, so push that aside. He's writing on sentence myself.

Speaker 1:          01:16:31       What I am. Others had the making of me. It's everyone else's fault that I'm like this. Yeah, that's, that's, that's not extreme on a shit right there. No, but oh gold cause an effect on them. Here's my point. Here's my point because this is not, this is a gray area, right? We're in a gray area. Here's the problem. If he looks at it, if he only lens that he looks at it through is this is everyone else's fault and he's not to blame, then guess what? He's not going to make any changes. If he had a little bit, if he just looked at the situation and said, you know what? All these happened, but some of this is because of me. Yeah. Some of this is because the actions that I've taken and I can now change my behavior so I don't stay in this mode of operating right now. That's the difference. Yeah, and he never makes that change. He never makes that that different. He never sees it that way. The only thing he sees is that it's everyone else's fault and when you, this is the thing he goes, you can see it gradually increases. He's, he's going from like, oh I just hate this teachers and and I just hate them, the wardens and eventually he hates everybody cause it's everyone else's fault. Even people he doesn't even know because they're a member of the human race. He hates them.

Speaker 3:          01:17:54       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:17:56       That's why personal responsibility, so important to teach to kids. Yes sir. It is so important to teach the kids and that's one thing I think I learned. I mean obviously I've got some of it from my parents, but it was really crystal clear when I came when I came in the military because it's black and white that the gray area is gone. When you go through some kind of military indoctrination, the gray area is gone. You mess this up, it's your fault. You're going to get punished for it. Yeah. We still get guys right that oh sure. For sure. Drill sergeant is writing me or whatever or you know, Bill, he should have done this. Jones should have done that. Right? It's like okay, but it doesn't matter. Sure. Yeah. Okay. The man, does it matter back to the book, I have only a little knowledge, but I have as much intelligence as the average person and I know I was taught wrong. I could have been taught properly and if I had been, I sure feel I would led a far different life than I have done. You are to blame more so than I just straight up you. He's talking to us, talking to her general human, the race of human beings. That's my belief. If you are going to go on teaching others as you have taught me, then you must suffer the same as I.

Speaker 3:          01:19:15       Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:19:16       here we go. He is at this point on trial and this is from like a, I think this is one of the ones from a newspaper clipping or report, but it's another part. This is so this isn't pants, Rams Journal. This is some of the additional information back to the book on the stand pan. Drums, eyes slid toward the table where his pistol and burglar tools lay. Prosecutor Collins whispered to an assistant who hurried over and remove the exhibits to a safer place. The arms of the witness chair disappeared under pans, rams, huge hands as he faced the jury ignoring everyone else in the courtroom, you people got me here charged with housebreaking in larceny. I'm guilty. I broken and I stole what I didn't steal. I smashed. If the owner had come home, I would have knocked his brains out. Pans, rems, eyes took on this, uh, strange depth as he watched the jury.

Speaker 1:          01:20:12       There's something else you ought to know while you were trying me here, I was trying all of you too. I've found you guilty. Some of you I've executed. If I live, I'll execute some more of you. I hate the whole human race. He said evenly, a juror gasped. Pans, Ramsay. Round heads suddenly swung toward the prosecutor who looked alert and suspicious. You think I'm playing crazy, don't you? I'm not. I know right from wrong. No delusions. I don't hear anything. You don't care. My conscience doesn't bother me. I have no conscience. I believe the whole human race should be exterminated. I'll do my best to do, do it. Every chance I get the courtroom was now numb as pans. Ram turned to the doors once more. Now I've done my duty. You do yours.

Speaker 3:          01:21:12       So

Speaker 1:          01:21:17       he gets a long prison sentence and when he gets into prison, he actually kills a, uh, one of the civilian workers. They're in prison. Like a guy that just, is it like a maintenance guy who runs the laundry and

Speaker 3:          01:21:33       he's has a beef and kills him. And

Speaker 1:          01:21:40       this is where we start. This isn't one of the letters. So I talked about the Guy Henry lessor who was a garden, one of the prisons he was in who formed a relationship with him when he actually says a couple of times that this is the only guy that like didn't try and take some from, I think the whole thing started off a game, like a dollar to buy cigarettes or whatever and no one, according to him, no one had ever done anything nice for pan drowned in his whole life. And this, this garden was the first guy to do it. So he develops a relationship with them and so they go, they write letters back and forth, and here's the excerpt of one of those many letters back to the book. The real truth of the matter is that I haven't the least desire to reform very much.

Speaker 1:          01:22:23       The reserve reverse of that is true. I would not reform if the front gate was open right now and I was, and if I was given $1 million when I stepped out, I have no desire to do good or to be good. I am just as mean now as I can be and the only reason I am no worse is because I lacked the power and the proper opportunity for meanness. If I had the power and the opportunities, then I would soon show you what real meanness was. You overlook the fact that the law and a great many people have been trying their damnedest for 25 years to reform me. I am tired of having people try to reform me. What I want to do is reform them and I think the best way to reform them is to put out of their misery. It took me 36 years to be like I am now. Then how do you figure that I could if I wanted to change from black to white in the twinkling of an eye?

Speaker 3:          01:23:25       Another letter,

Speaker 1:          01:23:28       same theme. I have no desire to reform under such conditions as would be required of me the way the laws of this country are today. I do not care to live any longer. If I must live in prison, I would far rather die and go to hell if that's where people like me go after death. I've very thoroughly considered this matter and I assure you now what I say is the truth. I've confessed 21 different cold blooded, premeditated murders, hundreds of cations of cases of arson, burglaries, robberies, rapes, and other crimes. The law has by this time looked them up and verify the truth of my various confessions. My philosophy of life is such that very few people ever get and just so deeply ingrained and burned into me that I don't believe I could ever change my beliefs. The things I've done to others, the things that I have had done to me by others and the things I have done to them can never be forgotten or forgiven either by me or others. I can't forget and I won't forgive. I couldn't if I wanted to. The law is in the same fix.

Speaker 1:          01:24:38       My belief is that the life without liberty is not worth having. If a law won't kill me, I shall kill myself. I fully realize that I am not fit to live among people in a civilized community. I have no desire to do so. If I had any choice in living any longer, the only way I would consent to do so would be to get clear out and away from all civilized people. I'm so set in my ways that I cannot adapt myself to the ways of other people so that the only way for me to do would be to live by myself without any human companionship. Whatever. He actually describes this island that he's kind of spent a little time on when he was down in South America. Then he's like, send me there if you wanted to send me somewhere, goes back. So now he'd killed that other guy, wonky the civilian and now he's going to trial for that murder. And this is a newspaper report of that trial. Back to the book, the commission heard the hard boiled giant tell of the fun which he received in killing a man and there isn't a man in this room. I wouldn't kill the cruel visage steel eyed man told the commission I mad plenty mad. Now I don't believe there's any good in any man. I'd like to have the opportunity to go weigh, gain power and brains and then I'd like to kill off the rest of the world. The convict said,

Speaker 3:          01:26:14       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:26:15       Dr. Perry asked the giant if he believed himself better than the rest of mankind. Hell no was the reply. I've checked up on myself lately and I know that I'm probably worse than the rest of you. I have no desire to live. If you would hang me, my troubles would be over and I would be better. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:26:30       rough,

Speaker 1:          01:26:33       but don't you fear Hell Fire? A member of the commission inquired. You haven't been able to prove to me that there is such a thing. Penn pans, ram answered the man boasted in court of killing 21 person's and vowed that when his parents were his parents living, he would kill them. Quote for bringing me into the world.

Speaker 3:          01:26:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:26:52       There are two things in this world that count as powerful money and knowledge. If I could get enough money, I would buy brains because brains are for sale. I could get a brainy chemist and I would have them prepare me a lot of poison gas and germs. With these I would be able to exterminate a great mass of human beings. Then I would kill myself. Society should build a great monument because I have never propagated my kind. So that's what his little excerpt of what his trial was like. This, you know, he was done. I mean he just did not care.

Speaker 1:          01:27:30       Back to the book, and this is the good book itself. The court convened again the next morning and the judge having been given no alternative by the hard rural jury look down at the defendant and pronounced him guilty with no mention of lifesaving phrase without capital punishment pans. Ram had nothing to say concerning the sentence. Hopkins then ordered that he be remanded with to the care of the warden at the Federal Penitentiary Penitentiary at Leavenworth there to be confined until the fifth day of September when between the hours of six and nine o'clock in the morning, you shall be taken to some suitable place within the confines of the penitentiary and hanged by the neck until dead. The judge then announced the 90 day interval to allow for any bill of objection and appeal before the defense attorney could speak pans. Ram said swiftly. I don't want any attorney to file for a new trial or appeal anything. I am satisfied with the verdict. So while he's now on death row, there's a like a delegation of people that are against capital punishment and they start fighting to get them off death row.

Speaker 3:          01:28:39       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:28:40       And he writes them a letter and here's a little part of that letter. On February 1st, 1929 I began serving this sentence at the u s penitentiary at 11 worth Kansas. On June 20th, 1929 I murdered one man, a civilian employee of the prison by the name of warranty. And at the same time and place I also attempted to murder a dozen other both guards and convicts. The only reason I did not kill them was also because I couldn't catch them. If I give, if I'm given another trial or if the death sentence should be commuted to life imprisonment either in penitentiary or an insane asylum, it will be against my will.

Speaker 2:          01:29:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:29:20       And then he goes on to try to explain to them, cause he doesn't want them to think that he's crazy because if he's crazy then he's not, he's going to get it's insane asylum or you know, reason of insanity. Back to the book. I shall try and convince you that I am quite saying at this time,

Speaker 1:          01:29:38       I am at this time, 38 years old, a big powerful man, strong in both body and mind. My physical fitness is not as good as it once was, but my mental facilities are unimpaired in any way. I've never used drugs of any kind or any type. I am. I am and always have been a very moderate drinker of liquor, practically a total abstainer. I've never taken any disease of any kind which would have the tendency to weaken my intellect. I have never been addicted to any habits of sexual excesses of any kind over which I didn't have complete control of myself. I choose to die here and now by being hanged by the neck until I'm dead. I prefer that I die that way and if I have a soul and if that soul should burn in hell for a million years still, I prefer that to a lingering, agonizing death in some prison dungeon or a padded cell and a mad house.

Speaker 1:          01:30:32       I do not believe that being hanged by the neck until dead is a barbaric or in human punishment. I look forward to to it as a real pleasure and a big relief for me and not feel bad or unhappy about it in any way everyday since I received that sentence, I've felt pretty good. I feel good right now and I believe that when my last hour comes, I will dance out of my dungeon and onto the scaffold with a smile on my face and happiness in my heart. Another reason why I believe that this sentence should be carried out is because I believe it is justice and I am quite sincere when I say that. This is the first and only time in my life of battling with the law that I ever did get justice from the law. One other thing I am going to tell you before I stopped this letter and that is this, the only thanks that you are your kind will ever get from me for your efforts on my behalf is that I wish you all had one neck and then I had my hands on it.

Speaker 2:          01:31:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:31:26       I would sure put you out of your misery. Just the same as I've done with numbers of other people.

Speaker 2:          01:31:32       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:31:33       I have no desire, whatever to reform myself. My only desires to reform people who try to reform me, and I believe that the only way to do reform to people is to kill him. My motto is rape a mall, rob a mall and kill them all. I am very truly yours. Carl Pans Ram

Speaker 3:          01:32:09       another

Speaker 1:          01:32:13       letter, I think it was the next to the last letter that he wrote to Lesser Henry Lusher. He says, I had no choice about coming into this world and nearly 38 nearly all of my 38 years in that have had very little to say and do about how I should live my life. People have driven me into doing everything I've ever done. Now, the time has come when I refuse to be driven any further, so again, I've just done, I've only done what I've done because of what other people have done to me. That's not on me. Zero responsibility. Everything I've ever done is because of other people ever, ever. It's a slippery slope that you just tried to step on him for a couple minutes ago. Yes, it is actually in your thinking about it

Speaker 4:          01:33:01       [inaudible] aren't you? Yeah, but I'm not wrong because I'm not talking about the blame. I'm talking about cause and effect. But here's the thing though, caused an effect. It's kind of like that's easy to start blaming. You know you got us this, see what I'm saying? Technically I want to split hairs, but technically there's a difference.

Speaker 3:          01:33:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:33:26       My point is if you have the Aetnas this, I mean I work with people all the time and this is the most important transition that people make in their brain

Speaker 1:          01:33:37       is whether you're a business leader, whether you're talking about your personal life, whether you're talking about the, the family, whatever you're talking about, the transition that you make from doing what you're saying right now, which is like, well, it's actually their fault. They've, that's in the back of your mind. Okay. If that's in the back of your mind like, okay, the problem is it grows. Yeah. The problem is you use that. The Prom is next thing, you know, it's not just that their fault, it's this, it's their fault. And it's the other thing that's their fault and it's the my team's fault. And it's a, and I, it's not my fault. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:34:10       Yeah. I mean, just to be clear though, that I'm not seeing the fault part of it. The fault, the fault in the blaming, that part of it literally has nothing to do with it. Are you saying caused an effect? There are two different things. There's the look, put it this way. Look, okay. And I said, kind of say this as a joke where, I dunno, let's say I did something right and then I'd be like, well, it's not my fault. It's, um, you know, my parent's fault for having me. Oh, but it's their fault. There are actually, it's great. My grandparents fault for having them. Oh No, it's the, you know, my great grand, you know, and you start just blaming every little factor that contributed to this result. Every little factory. Right. Here's the, so basically to kind of break that apart, it's like, yeah, if my parents didn't have me, this wouldn't have happened.

Speaker 4:          01:34:55       It's true. It's true. But the thing is you can't just start point blame as far as assigning blame goes. I'm not assigning blame if I'm saying, Hey, this is a factory or whatever as unless I'm doing it as a joke. You see what I'm saying? Okay. So it's like, okay, so if when you do cross the line to start assigning blame, that's when you can't be like, okay, it's everything else that you've got to blame yourself. But it, let's say you're not assigning blame, you're just maybe analyzing it from an objective perspective. So what I'm saying, you can identify all kinds of causes, all kinds of causes seem sane and they're probably true. Okay. But not having anything to do with causing bleeding or, or assigning blame, we're saying who's fault it is. Same. Same check. Okay. It's just, uh, another example of how like you or we, whatever when I talked to a lot of the time, sometimes all you will take a scenario and I'll just sort of marvel at different working parts of this scenario.

Speaker 4:          01:35:56       Like, oh, isn't it interesting how this is this and this is this, but you could do this and look at it this way too, even though it has nothing to do with me, you know? And it has nothing to do with any kind of actions to be taken or nothing like that. It's essentially just analyzing the scenario and being interested in it versus you, you always look at the scenario like, okay, yeah, cool, that's cool. You analyze it, but what do you do? You know, your attitude is really a real take action kind of kind of approach. So I think that's where I think that's where we're getting some, some misfires. So what I'm saying, you think that it's like I want to base some action to be taken upon the way I'm looking at it when it requires no action, it's just the way to sort of look at it, you know?

Speaker 4:          01:36:42       But if you want to take action, like, okay, so who do we blame? That's, that's the beginning of taking action in a way. Who Do we blame? What do we got to fix? Who Do we got to fix? Whatever to move forward to fix a situation, to, you know, whatever. Rectify it. Then you've got to be like, okay, I've got to identify the problem that I can change. And then yeah, in that case, then yeah, that problem's going to be yourself. It's the best way. And if it's not, then you're not going to solve anything. Yeah. You just can't sit around and blame people. Yeah. But does that make sense? Maybe I don't recommend it. No. Yeah, and that's the thing. Yeah. And again, even that was saying, I don't recommend it. That's like, that's super indicative of just like, yeah, you don't recommend that as a problem solving technique. That's a t that's an take action approach right there. See what I'm saying? It's kind of like if we came to a stoplight and then the stop lights red and I'm like, wow, isn't that red stoplight? Super Nice. Like, it's a beautiful color of red and you're going to be like, yeah, like, but it means to stop. So we're stopped. I'm like, no, I know, but isn't it kind of beautiful? Then it turns green. Wow. Isn't that a beautiful green light?

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       And you were like, yeah, but it's, it means to go. And I'm like, cool. But it's a pretty nice shade of green. You see what I'm saying? See what I'm saying? It's like two different perspectives. Yeah. And then of course he drove through the green light and you know, I had to go get after it. All right, we'll leave that one at that. All right. Um, obviously the attempts to save Carl Pans Ram were ceased. And here's how his life and according to this book at Leavenworth, the lights of the isolation that burned into a pale gray dawn, September 5th, when pants ram heard the distant distant rattle of footsteps. It was not quite six o'clock guard. Bellard went over to the steel door leading to an outer corridor and peered through the small barred window warden whites. Voice was heard and the guard turned a brass key in the lock. The door swung open. White entered the isolation at the head of the procession of some 20 persons including guards and newspaper reporters. Immediately behind the warden was Marshall McKeever of McKeever and the tall government hang man carrying the leather harness over one arm. White stopped in front of pans, rams cell.

Speaker 1:          01:39:18       The spectators press themselves discretely against the opposite wall. It's pans. Ram faced them searching through the wire mesh with his hostile eyes.

Speaker 2:          01:39:27       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:39:28       He saw two men in clerical garb on the fringes of the crowd in a once began to roar it white.

Speaker 2:          01:39:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:39:36       Are there any Bible backed cock suckers in here? I thought you might change your mind. White apologized. These gentlemen came along. Way To offer you comfort. Get 'em out. Shouted Pants, Ram. I don't mind being hanged, but I don't need any Bible back to hypocrites around me. Run them out, warden, or you'll have one hell of a time getting me out of this cell. Every man I get a hand on his going to the hospital.

Speaker 2:          01:40:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:40:04       White new pans. Ram was within a condemned man's traditional rights regarding witnesses of his own execution.

Speaker 2:          01:40:13       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:40:14       The disappointed clergy men were escorted out. All right, pants. Ram said. Let's get going. What are we stalling for?

Speaker 2:          01:40:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:40:22       White motions. The guards, a newsman to proceed to the exercise yard is Bollard opened pants, ram sell pans. Ram helped as escorts faster the fast and the leather corset. Anything you want to say? Ask The hangmen. Fumbling with a strap pans. Ram snapped impatiently. Yes. Hurried up. You. Who's your bastard? I could hang a dozen men while you're fooling around.

Speaker 2:          01:40:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:40:49       In the yard, the newsman took hurried notes. The scaffold looked strange. Somehow unexpected. Do glistened on the boards that had the raw temporary look of a structure erected for a county fair.

Speaker 2:          01:41:02       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:41:03       In less than a minute, the backdoor of the isolation opened and pans. Ram was emerged between Ballard and the hang man pans. Ram was almost running ahead, half dragging the taller, his taller escorts, white and the Marshall Hurry behind, trailed by officer's trying to look dignified as they ran.

Speaker 2:          01:41:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:41:22       And the confusion the spectators parted into two lines as they per session. As the procession raised pell mell and their direction pans, rams face was rigid and look straight ahead. His eyes fixed on the rope.

Speaker 2:          01:41:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:41:35       Only at the foot of the stairs did he seem to notice the transfixed onlookers. He paused, look slowly around and spat twice that his face was forward again. Everyone's nostrils inhaled the sweet smell of new oak and hemp and everyone's eyes followed him up the 13 steps which he felt with his feet. He hurried up the gallows as toward the gate pulling Ballard and the hang man with him. Reporters who had witnessed this event were surprised by it. Swiftness and their accounts were in conflict as to the time and exact detail.

Speaker 2:          01:42:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:42:14       There was uncertainty as to whether pans, Ram and been able to spit on the executioner as he had promised. He would the reporter's notebooks hide hung limp during the swift adjustment of the rope. The exploding sound of the opening doors and the swift downward stroke of the body.

Speaker 2:          01:42:30       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:42:31       Later they recalled the mist which had settled on the yard and the indistinct figures of guards watching from a tower on the wall. The prison had been quiet. The first bell was not yet scheduled to ring for an hour. Reporters had left the same way. They came in and were relieved to find themselves outside the walls. Records of official entry regarding the death of Carl Pans, Ram, our brief, Dr Justin Kay Fuller, one of the two doctors and attendants step forward and to the stretch body underneath the gallows, placed a stethoscope gently on the chest and palputated the neck.

Speaker 2:          01:43:12       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:43:13       Later he dictated his report to a prison clerk.

Speaker 2:          01:43:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:43:18       Medical certificate of death. Carl pants. Ram. I hereby certify that I examined the body of Carl Pans Ram in accordance with the directions of the surgeon general of the US public health service and attorney general at us penitentiary Leavenworth, Kansas on September 5th, 1930 and pronounced him dead at 6:18 AM

Speaker 2:          01:43:40       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:43:41       I found the cause of death to be dislocation, cervical vertebra, strangulation, legal execution, and so ended the life of Carl Pans Ram on September 5th, 1930 and while pans, Ram died, evil as we see certainly did not die with him. It's still walks among us today. And as we've been going back and forth on, I obviously pans. Ram did not get many benefits in life, but that does not excuse his actions. And we are responsible for what we do. We are responsible for our lives. And if someone's had a horrible things happen to them, if they've seen horrible things, if they've done horrible things, it's still important that you don't be calm. Those horrible things that you don't propagate those horrible things.

Speaker 3:          01:45:18       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:45:19       Instead be the hero, be the savior that absorbs those things, those horrible things and passes on good. And you do that. You do that by Pete treating people with respect and being kind to other human beings.

Speaker 3:          01:45:48       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:45:49       And it's, it's one of those things that I've thought about this one character, this does Henry Lesser. This guard is the first person that that pans ram ever fought. Did something nice to him. And who knows if that had happened earlier, maybe could have been a teacher at the state school. Maybe that's what tips someone towards the good.

Speaker 3:          01:46:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:46:22       You know, are you that person? Can you be that person that's sways someone from doing evil deeds, doing good simply crew, some sympathetic words, some compassionate gesture. Think about that. Might be that person. I might be that person. We be that person that sets the good example by being nice, by being kind. And here's the dichotomy. At the same time, you gotta be strong enough to stand up to people that think might makes right. You gotta be strong enough to face the malevolent force of evil.

Speaker 2:          01:47:24       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:47:25       And you have to recognize that that is everywhere.

Speaker 2:          01:47:34       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:47:37       That's say tannic force that is waiting to prey on the weak. And if we don't fight it, the net force has got to win.

Speaker 2:          01:47:56       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:47:57       So we cannot stand down.

Speaker 2:          01:48:05       Hey Tom, I think that's all I've got for tonight. Kind of a rough one. Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:48:22       When you think about it, this is like, this is pretty psycho, like pretty psychotic. Safeway's evil for sure. But I dunno if it was just the way he, it is the, it is. I do know it's the way he presented it was like, it wasn't like as tragic is, I don't know the other stuff that, that I've heard, let me take a part of it. He wrote it and he became humanized in your head. So you were listening to him talk and you were sympathizing with him and you were understanding the harshness that he went through and you were completely detached and not, you didn't humanize any of the victims at all, right? Yes. That's what it was opposite of the beginning when I'm talking about this beautiful girl Luisa. Yes. From what she went, you know, you understood her. Go watch some of the videos of that girl.

Speaker 1:          01:49:18       Yeah. You're such a nice person. Yeah. Like just like an angel. Yeah. And that's what you relate to. So as a, as a person yourself, as a human being yourself, it's very easy for you to get three to humanize someone, right. If you listen to crawl in room, used to be here, what he's been through and he's telling it from his perspective and all these tiny little 11 year old boy, you don't know anything about that boy. Just some arbitrary arbitrary thing doesn't even barely exist. It's a word. Yeah. Boy. That's all it is. Yeah. But it's not. It's not.

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       It's a little kid. That's a little kid. Yeah, that's exactly it. That's exactly what it was. You're going through his struggles. Ensure he's not print well. Yeah. And you know, he's talking about his anger and everyone did sorry. And you're like, Dang, Okay Bang. That's, you know, he's, he's a mad guy and sure I'm not, you know, I'm not siding with him, but it's, it's more like you're just getting it from his Pr, his perspective, you know, then he dies in your life. Well, you deserved it. Yeah. Yeah. But if, yeah, if they'd told that the whole story of like, I dunno, any one of them new, one of those victims will be like, Dang man, this is heavy. It's dark. Any sorta like, he didn't go into any kind of graphic detail, you'd just be like, oh, I commuted, sought him. In fact, I was like, Bro, how are you even doing that?

Speaker 5:          01:50:32       You're just like, just sorta committed, tried to commit. Like how do you do that? You know, you just, hey, come here, let me commit sodomy on you. I mean, I dunno. He made it sound like 200 pound dude against an 11 year old boy. Yeah. But even like the, you know, his inmates or whatever, then everyone, he was just the, and the point is there, he just sorta, he's preying on the weak. He says all the time, he's just picking a guy that's 132 pounds. Yeah. But yeah, and just 200 pounds. Yeah. Six feet. 200 yeah. You know, he was, I don't know what the, what the deal is, but like where I grew up in New England, the houses like the ceilings are lower and the doors are smaller because people were smaller. Yeah. Back in the day, and this is a hundred years ago, but we're born ever 90 years ago. But people are a little bit smaller, you know, so him at six foot one 90 is kinda like a yoke to dude. Yeah. Plus with all that, you know, years of hard labor in an 18 pound hammer. Yeah. You know, he was strong. Yeah. But he just sorta breezes over it though. You know, there's no graphic details. Just sorta. Yeah. It just committed some bad crimes, you know? So that's why it's always good to think about the perspective of the other people. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:51:55       It's crazy, man. It's crazy. But you know, and yeah, he could have, he should have, he should have chosen a path is what he should've done. Like how you said, yeah, he said that. Right. Well, more important I think because you're going to have some people out there that are going to choose the wrong path. They're not, they're not going to go, they're not going to go in a good direction. And that's why it's important to be prepared mentally and physically to stand up and face that man. It's true. You got to, speaking of which, take some Jujitsu. I'll tell you right now, you take some Jujitsu, you really decrease the probability of anyone attempting sodomy on you. Yes. It is a big help. Reduce, reduce. Um, anyway, what that means is we're going to, regardless of

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       our, our, our, what we're trying to defend ourselves from

Speaker 1:          01:52:50       Jujitsu versus evil. That's what I'm saying. Yes. It helps you. Yes. You need all your tools to fight against evil.

Speaker 4:          01:52:57       Yeah. Big Time. There's evil in the world. Confirmed. Yeah. Fully live evil in the world right now. Friesen crazy. Every once in a while I'll flash it will flash in my mind how valuable Jujitsu is. Like if you, if someone said, hey you can, you can never go to the beach ever again or you can never do to get to a fair again. See what I'm saying? Oh you, you might have some issues.

Speaker 1:          01:53:25       No, I just think that's funny how like the two biggest things you can put on the beach in Jujitsu, just saying you got to give up one beach isn't even on my list. I mean all doesn't to go surfing, but were just going to the beach for you as a thing. For me, it's not really,

Speaker 4:          01:53:40       oh yeah. Well put it this way, like I pry, could I trade a, I'd give up a lot to keep Jujitsu if it was, here's something,

Speaker 1:          01:53:53       if you know some Jujitsu, if you know some Jiu Jitsu, if you know more of Jujitsu than most other people around you, that's a real beneficial thing. Yeah, can you, and it's funny because if you don't know anything, you're a little bit ignorant. In fact, you're in a Latte, right? And you don't even know what you don't know. And so you're sitting in, you're, you're walking across a parking lot, right? And it's 10 o'clock at night when someone comes to bother you and you think in your mind like, oh, just do this and this and you don't know anything. It's a complete, it's a complete whole in your game. And the game of life is what I'm talking about. They gave him a life. If it is, if you know Jujitsu and you're walking across 10 o'clock at night and someone's going to give you a problem, you actually know what to do. Yeah. And, and the person that doesn't know anything there, so bar

Speaker 4:          01:54:42       just behind, it's crazy. I remember in college where, and I knew how to do a rear naked choke and like, you know, just from watching UFC never trained to actual Jujitsu class. But I remember in college I got into this like fight, right. And we ended up not fighting, fighting, but you know, the kind that we started to fight, but it was nothing. You know what it was it a friend? No. Okay. He was like, was it a known person or just a total random, he was like at a party scenario. No, I didn't know. Um, and, and you know, whatever, it doesn't matter what, how he got broken up, whatever. And we continued our lives. But right now I'm thinking back to like how much I didn't know. Like what was I even thinking like, Whoa, was I going to do just sort of throw punches, you know, or something like this.

Speaker 4:          01:55:35       Like what? Like even when you do get in a fight and you don't really know any especially need you to do, it's like man, you just sort of, it's sort of a shoot really compared to if you know Jujitsu, it's not a crap shoot. It's like, oh, I'm going to either decide to do whatever. I want pennant thing to this person if you want to, if you don't train Jujitsu and you want to know what it's like, picture anything that you actually know how to do. Like shoot a basketball or play basketball. Yeah. And picture someone that never played before playing against you. That's what's going to happen. Yeah. If you don't know anything or like say go find someone. If you ever can find someone who doesn't know how to ride a bike or a skateboard. Yes. Not everyone knows how to ride a skateboard but a bike and say, hey, let's race to the end of the block on this bike and that person doesn't even know how to write it.

Speaker 4:          01:56:27       They never been on a bike before. They have zero chance of it. Btu I know. Brett's like that. Anyway, so train some Jujitsu, train some. As you get to go take some classes. Brad, just go ahead and go learn how to ride that bike right now. Right now in America you can train Jujitsu and so many different places. It's amazing. Yeah, it is very amazing. There's amazing places to train Jujitsu. So go train some Jujitsu. Yeah, and when you do, so you want to do geek end Nogi so when you get a g, what Geeta we get, we all know if you don't already origins, you go to origin may.com I got a rash guards on there as well. Joggers as well. Shirts, supplements, supplements, of course. And that's a good one to wear. And I took your advice, you know. Okay. Remember I told you like Oh yeah a I didn't take joint warfare for like a few days.

Speaker 4:          01:57:16       And you're like, what? Why not other? Cause they just don't, I don't know, I forgot or whatever. Here's the thing, I admitted something to myself sometimes when I didn't back then and when I didn't take it. It's not that I forgot, it's just that I'd be like, oh I'll take one tomorrow or something. I'm like, I'm literally, I was literally too lazy to just go in the pantry right here. Not by the way, like three, four feet away. Get it, open it up in your routine now bro. Yes. And this is how I put it into my routine and I was like, there's no way I'm going to be able to accept the fact that I'm too lazy to spend literally 20 seconds literally and you know, and take some pills. It's like no way I can accept that, that I'm not trapped in your brand.

Speaker 4:          01:58:04       I'm kind of am I guess a little bit for at least two hours a week. I'm a little bit trapped in your brand. Well you're the one who's correcting it because I'm like no way. Cause you're like, dude, just do it in your routine and you make it sound so easy cause it doesn't feel that easy. But then I'm thinking like, wait, it is that easy. Really. I'm just not allowing it to put it by your toothbrush or whatever. No, I keep it in the pantry. Brow 15 seconds. Oh, but you just do it. Just do it. Yeah. Do a little extra. Very little extra. Anyway. Check joint warfare. Krill oil. These are the ones that I'm talking about. Desert in my routine every single day. Joints, all situations

Speaker 5:          01:58:42       to discipline, which if you don't know, we have a new flavor of discipline out. It's called Tropic Thunder. I got mine and let's, let's be real and let's be honest, what it, what it is, peanut peanut Colada, but I couldn't have something out there called bt or Gelada. Come on man. Tropic Thunder. Isn't that a movie? Late baboons? Favorite movie of all time? No, actually I don't, but it's right up there. They've quotes that movie a lot. I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you right here, I haven't seen it. You haven't seen tropic thunder. That's definitely a movie that is so I think Robert Downey Jr, right? Yeah, but the most important character in there is Tom Cruise's character. He's really, really funny. Less good man I think is his name. And anyways, so we couldn't call it in clear conscious, we couldn't call it Pina Colada.

Speaker 5:          01:59:38       That's just wrong, right? No, not happening. It's an alcoholic beverage. We're not doing it. It's kind of a kind of a foo foo. Is that a good word? Kind of a food foods like you ever been to an Italian restaurant or like where they, where it's real. It's real nice. It's too nice. Like they don't have like, hey can I just get some chicken Parmesan over here and when they bring you some food, it's really small and it has like a long like name in a different language. But you know I'm came be put extras on the name, you know, you know fresh clot from the Appalachian, Blah Blah Blah. In the title. It's like that came but there's never very much food. The longer the title, the less food you're going to get. That's a good rule. So couldn't go Pina Colada to Fufu. We went tropic thunder for Leif Babin. You didn't get as tropic thunder on it was pretty hot. And then don't forget about moke which additional protein? Additional protein and slash dessert. Yeah. Because it will fulfill your dessert desire. Yeah. When you get done with the ribeye steak,

Speaker 4:          02:00:47       so what's the game like when you, you know when you're going to, when you lift weights to elicit gains, you have to have a [inaudible] with a z you got to eat what, certain amount of protein or yeah, it's like 0.7 or 1.6 or just one gram. Yeah. But here's actually what I learned with one grab any protein, like any macro, they eat too much of get to turn into fat and protein. Proteins in kits turns to sugar first from what I understand. So you can't eat too much protein is I usually too much protein? If you're going like two grams per body weight per pound, right.

Speaker 5:          02:01:29       What about nine grams per bottle per pound of body weight? I think that's fine.

Speaker 4:          02:01:35       Here's a good way to do it. So in the morning I make a Omelet, right? With egg whites

Speaker 5:          02:01:40       and the good protein, clean, whatever, some of the best. But when you kind of, if you're starting, which I kind of started to measure these things or keep track of, okay, how many cal I am, I really [inaudible] whatever. So I realize there's not that much protein in a regular size, even a double size egg white omelet with no cheese. And so boom, you make your egg white Omelette train going on the side, make your milkshake boom, perfect. Oh milkshake, perfect amount of protein, cheese. What I'm saying, if in fact you're into, you know, getting stronger and what not. And on top of that we got warrior kid milk, which is basically going to take over all milk drinks for children in the very short period of time because everyone wants their kid to be healthy. Yeah. The kid wants to be healthy and strong and the kid wants something that tastes absolutely amazing.

Speaker 5:          02:02:39       So there you go. Where your kid milk. Yeah. Remember like back in the day, what was the fruit Hawaiian Punch or was that only in Hawaii Hawaiian Punch back tasted like, hey, our English muffins. Oh actually you can just, muffins aren't in England. It's not a British thing. Yeah, just like French fries aren't and friends, right. I don't they call them like palm treat something else French anyway. You know what I'm saying? You used to drink the Hawaiian Punch when you're little mouth. I'll read. Tasted pretty good. Yeah. Well it's a super strong. Yeah, but bro, you can't be giving your kids that like now with no knowledge. Really. It's chilled child abuse. And it's not just that these, these regular chocolate milk. What is that? It's just corn syrup in milk. Yeah. That's all it is. And chocolate and chocolate and sugar. But we get kid warrior kid more.

Speaker 5:          02:03:39       Guess what? You're making them stronger, smarter, faster, better and it tastes good and it tastes delicious because kids don't want to drink something that tastes like crap. No, they don't drink something tasty. So yeah, we're your kid walk all that stuff that we just talked about. Is that origin main.com if you want to set porch, that's a good stuff. All American made throw that in there like it's a no big deal. Yeah, go watch some of the videos of, of looms being remade. It's good.

Yeah, sure. Yes I am. Thank you. Okay. I know you were just telling me about one, you've done this before where you tell me about a video and I never see it for four months because like, well, and this one could be one of those cuts. It's like I'm going to be like pushing it. You know? Remember the war path one, I pushed it in the music and I was like, hey, should I make a bunch of things crumbling down? Is that going to be dumb? But in the process of doing that, sometimes I'm like, this is kind of done, so I got to change it. So I'm going to see, I want to push it out of fun, but yeah, okay, I'm going to try it. How about that? More, more videos. And also we've got psychological warfare, which we have failed. We were going to get out that for the new year. We did not accomplish that. So that's not good. But we will work on it. And the current one is available. Psychological warfare

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       on iTunes, Google play, MP, three platforms of all kinds where you can get little messages. We'll call from me tracks about how to overcome a particular weakness that you might be dealing with in the moment. I thought about this with psychological warfare. Sometimes, like when the weakness creeps in, we don't want to fight the weakness. It's like, yeah, like we're like, it's almost like, okay this is me. You might not be up to to relate cause you get mad when you feel like weakness. Sometimes weakness won't like creep in and I'll look forward to not lifting, you know what I mean? Or like, okay, so there's this burger place. All right. I'm not gonna say which one and to go to this burger places, certain burger you can get that's like off the program. You can't. Oh, okay. It's not a Diet Burger. Yeah. So when I, you know, when you're like, oh, should I just stick to the program, but I'm really in the mood for this burger.

Speaker 4:          02:08:40       Right. And the weakness creeps in, takes hold, and then you made the decision, all right, hey, I'm going to slip on the Diet right now. I'm back on the plan. I'm black, but I'm back on the program tomorrow, but I'm going to slip right now. When you make that decision in your head, you feel good. Like, oh, I don't want to change my mind because I was so looking forward to the burger. See what I'm saying? So it's like, what are those things where the reason sometimes people won't list, or, actually this has never happened to me, but I'm imagining the P, if someone doesn't want to listen to the psychological warfare it, that's why. Because it's like, oh, they just secretly, they don't want to accept it. And it's like, you know, and the except the weakness. Yeah. This again reminds me that I'm glad I'm not trapped inside your head for more than two hours.

Speaker 4:          02:09:28       Daily strong nonetheless, psychological or it's a good one. It helps. It helps you gotta eat. You gotta accept the hell you have to do is press play. That's the point you've got to go. That's where what you were saying, you have to press play. You gotta there's a little psychological part that you have to accept the fact that you're going to, you're going to get a spot. It's like in the gym, right? When you need a spot in the gym, you don't put on some lightweight, you know you get a, if you have a regular way on, you don't need a spot in cool, but you got to make the decision to put the heavy weight on there and then you've got to make the decision to go find someone to spot you. That part is hard for people. That's what I think. That's what I think. But once you get the spot and got the spot, you're in no danger of getting buried underneath that, that match. You see what I'm saying? Check. That's a psychological warfare is can we get it on? Ah, what? Amazon music and I tunes Apple Music. You know, wherever the they sell mp3s, that's where you get them playing on the core. Fair. Good one. Very good one. Also very up your workout man. Get some more workouts.

Of course we have extreme ownership, which was recently, uh, made some kind of chart for the audio book. Leif, Leif Babin and I read the audio book. Well, me and the Texas is Batman reading the Audio Book and we also read the audio book for the followup to that book, which is called the dichotomy of leadership, which I kicked off today with a tiny little excerpt. Um, that's the fallen one book. And I think, yeah, some people think it's better. Interesting. It makes sense that it is because now we've written more books and little

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       more experienced. Learn more. So find out for yourself dichotomy of leadership. That one's available. We also got Ashkelon Font. That's our leadership consultancy. We solve problems through leadership. That's what we do. If you need help with the leadership at your organization and if you have any kind of issue, whatever kind of issue you have, it's a leadership problem. It's not a problem of HR. It's a leadership problem. It's a not a problem in the finance department. It's a, it's a leadership problem. It's not an operational problem. It's a leadership problem.

If you want to come to that, try and jump on and buy a ticket real quick cause it's real close to sold out. Look forward to seeing their also f online. So we just launched this. What this is, this is an online interactive leadership training source. It's myself and the rest of the echelon front training team puts together, want to be able to reach more people. Some of the, you know, this kind of spawn from organizations that we work with where they have tens of thousands or even in some cases hundreds of thousands of employees and they want us to train everybody on the fundamental principles of combat leadership. Obviously with our six or seven instructors, we can't do that.

Speaker 1:          02:15:21       And so we had to figure out a whale way to scale the educational process. And so what we did is we went to virtual and so we put this together and once we made it we said, well what's it? We've made it. We're making it director to consumer as well. So if you want to check that out, you can go to e f online.com e f online.com and speaking of Def, yeah, for Overwatch. This is where we are connecting proven leaders, proven combat leaders from the SPEC ops community. And from combat aviation with companies in the civilian sector that need these experienced leaders to step up and lead their organizations. So eff overwatch.com is where you can get involved with that.
