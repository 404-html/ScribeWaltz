Speaker 1:          00:00          This is Jocko podcast number one 41 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. [inaudible] good evening.

Speaker 2:          00:10          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11          March 15th, 1631

Speaker 2:          00:16          yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:16          most loving and kind father and mother, my humble duty remembered unto you, trusting in God. You are in good health and I pray, remember my love on to my brother Joseph and thank him for his kindness that I found at his hand in London.

Speaker 2:          00:32          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33          I know loving father and I do confess,

Speaker 2:          00:36          yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:37          that I was an undue TOEFL child unto you when I live there with you and buy you for which I am much sorrowful and grieved for it. Trusting in God that he will guide me, that I will never offend you so any more and I trust in God that you will forgive me for it. My writing unto you is to let you understand what a country this new England is where we live. Here are but a few Indians, a great part of them died this winter. It was thought it was of the plague. Here is timber, good store and Acorns, good store and here is good store of fish. If we had boats to go for it in lines to surf fishing. People here are subject to diseases for there, for here. 200 odd have died of scurvy and of the burning fever and beside as many lie lame, all Sudbury men are dead but three and three women and some children.

Speaker 2:          01:52          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:53          Here is no cloth to be had to make no apparel and shoes.

Speaker 2:          01:59          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:00          So I pray father send me four or five yards of cloth to make some apparel and loving father though I be far distant from you yet I pray you remember me as your child and we do not know how long we may subsist. I pray. Do not put away your shop stuff for, I think that in the end if I live, it must be my living for we do not know how long this plantation will stand. God has taken away the Chiefest Stud in the land, Mr. Johnson and the lady Arabella, his wife, which was the cheapest man of a state in the land and one that would have done most good.

Speaker 2:          02:49          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:50          So father I pray consider of my cause for here will be but a very poor thing. No being without loving father your help with provisions from Old England.

Speaker 2:          03:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:06          I thought to come home in this ship from my provisions were almost all spent but that I humbly thank you for your great love and kindness and sending some provisions or else I should and mine have been half famished. But now I will if it please God that I have my health, I will plant what corn I can. My Wife Remembers her humble duty unto you and to my mother and my love to brother Joseph. Thus I leave you to the protection of all mighty God,

Speaker 1:          03:44          Watertown, New England. And that is an unsigned letter from, as I said, 1631 so these are settlers coming into New England, the f, the letters written back to a father and England and obviously written from a place called New England, which is where I grew up and where I am in the woods of right now in Franklin county, Maine. And we have a guest today that is also a new Englander, a Jujitsu black belt, the business owner, and a friend of mine by the name of Peter Roberts. He's been on the podcast before. So if you haven't listened to podcast 93 yet and you need to go get the backstory of how I met Peter and how this little deal got underway, go listen to podcasts 93 and then you can come back here and listen to the rest of this one. So here we go. Pete, welcome back. Thanks for having me.

Speaker 1:          04:51          And I'm extremely honored to be back on and was a little bit nervous to come back on. But uh, after all your razzing and you know, motivating and flanking me and after what you just read, I'm ready to go. Yeah, we got it pretty easy compared to those guys. Holy Shit. Yeah. And it's interesting because you know I live in southern California. Echo as we know is from Hawaii. Sure. And what's the temperature variation in Hawaii? In what inmate? No, no, in Hawaii. How much does the temperature? Very. Oh, one decree. Just kidding. I Dunno. 10 year round, something like that. 25 I think in the past three days there was a 40 degree change here in the weather in Maine. We went from 90 to 50 yeah, it absolutely gives you a false sense of hope. One day actually these people that settled here clearly were some sturdy stock that came up here.

Speaker 1:          05:48          You think about what they went through and leaving the comforts of England. And what I was thinking about is it's not like these were woodsmen from England, right? No you weren't hunters from England. I mean I'm sure some of them were, but they were people from England, from London and then they were all of a sudden surrounded by this and you can't prepare for like if there's nothing you can do conditioning wise to prepare for this, you just, you, you get here and you survive, you know, and that's what they're doing. I know you're talking about like, cause his dad had sent him provisions. That was his insurance policy. You know, I mean, hey, here's what we can offer you. And I never thought about on the other side side of things as a parent like that, who knows what they would they had for work or jobs, who knows if they sent them everything they had financially, what they could afford to send their son to keep him alive in New England.

Speaker 1:          06:40          And you've got a pretty much fixed geared that when your kid sales across the sea in 1631, you are never going to see them again. Right, right, right. You've got to figure you're never gonna see him again. Yeah. That's gotta be the thought. Um, all right, so welcome back. Like I said, now last podcasts, obviously we talked about origin, boom. And we talked about where it started, how it started, the trials and tribulations to say the least that you went through getting it to that point. But it's been a pretty, so you weren't on the podcast one year ago because we were up at this origin camp one year ago and now you're back on it again. But it's been a big gear than a huge benefit. Been a big year of growth for the company. How many people? We've grown by another 30 people. So total, we're like 40 plus people.

Speaker 1:          07:35          Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think this time last year we were, yeah, right around 12 to 15. And we, you know, you know what is crazy is, I don't know if I told you this this time last year, like I don't, I don't get real, I'm stressed out this time. Last year we had the immersion camp, right. We had a, the grand opening and the factory, we had just moved a 60,000 square foot factory into our factory like w like two or three weeks prior. And it was still moving into and there were some other things going on with business or whatever. And, and I, I don't know if I told you this one night I left camp during the, during, can't not tell me that I left camp and went home. I was by myself and my family was still here and I was laying in bed and I couldn't, uh, I couldn't get to sleep and I just felt really weird. Like my, my body felt weird and all of a sudden my heart, I felt like it was beating through my chest and I was like, what is going on? Come to find out I had an anxiety attack. Never had it in my life. I haven't had 1 cents and there was more going on. Does that actually mean? I don't even know what that, oh dude, I had never, I mean, sounds like some of the echo 38 or 38 years, you're cruising super hard. 38 years old.
