Speaker 1:          00:00:01       This is Jocko podcast number 84 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening, gentlemen. Your life expectancy from the day you join your battalion will be precisely three weeks. The Florid mustached major who addressed us at the small reinforcement camp, a few miles from bay, you obviously had misplaced, had a misplaced sense of humor or he should have been sacked on second thought. He definitely should have been sacked. Not that any of the dozen infantry Sabol turns took the slightest notice of what to us with a ramblings of an old fool. He was probably no more than 40 the fourth battalion, the Somerset Light Infantry was in one 29 brigade and was a prewar territorial army battalion with close links with Bristol and bath in the United Kingdom till late June, 1944 it was a close knit unit which had almost been decimated within a period of 48 hours on 5th of July three officers and 62 other ranks. We're required as reinforcements. Between the 14th and the 18th of July, a further 12 officers of whom I was one and 479 other ranks arrived and even then the battalion was still below its full strength of 36 officers and nearly 700 and CEO's and men.

Speaker 1:          00:01:55       This will give some idea of the appalling level of infantry casualties which had to be accepted in order to enlarge the slender and vulnerable Normandy beach head. Because I had the had had previous experience of six pounder anti tank guns. The commanding officer lippy Lieutenant Colonel Cg Lipscomb posted me as second in command to the battalions anti tank platoon, which consisted of six guns, but my stay with the platoon were short and I was quickly sucked into the real infantry battle as commander of 18 platoon in d company on the 31st of July. Immediately after the battle of brisk Broussard d company had just lost their commander Tim Braithwaite who lost a foot and gained a military cross and 18 platoon their commander. So that right is the beginning

Speaker 2:          00:03:01       of a book that we're going to look at today. It's called 18 platoon. It's written by a guy named Sydney, Jerry j, a r, y, who was born in Essex in 1924 joined the army in 1942 as a private soldier in 1943 he was commissioned

Speaker 1:          00:03:25       and from 19 from July of 1944 until June of 1945 he served as the platoon commander for 18 platoon. And the chances of survival for an infantry subaltern in a rifle company during the campaign in northwest Europe were slim. Most survived for only a few weeks. Sydney, Jerry survived 10 months from July, 1944 when he took command of 18 platoon in Normandy until the end of the war, near Bremen in early May of 1945 so this guy, this is, this is amazing, this guy, Sydney Jerry, he's the only platoon commander in the, any British second army to survive as a platoon commander from Normandy to the German surrender. One Guy, one guy, and this is the guy.

Speaker 2:          00:04:30       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:04:30       it's, it's amazing. And you're going to see that his attitude is, I mean, the, the lessons that he learned, he was young coming in. Who's 20 years old, 20 year old platoon commander coming in inexperienced, kind of lived a sheltered life. You've got to check out some pictures of him. He has that look to, it looks like he looks like you don't sheltered. It looks like a little young whippersnapper. Sure. So we'll go back to the book here as he breaks down what a platoon was at this time. In 1944 the war establishment of a British infantry platoon was 36 men. It consisted of three rifles, sections, each of 10 men, including a Brendan gunner, each commanded by a corporal or sometimes a lance sergeant. There was also a small platoon headquarters with a two inch mortar detachment, a PR, which was an anti tank weapon. The platoon sergeant and the commanders, Batman slash runner on July 31st 18 platoon consisted of 17 all ranks, 12 of them are more recent reinforcements. Halal one 12 and brick Krista guard had claimed the rest. So, so think about that. You're supposed to have 36 people in your platoon, and they have 17 of which 12 our replacements,

Speaker 3:          00:05:59       which means that 29 people had had been casualties. There's seven people that had been either killed or wounded, or sorry, seven people out of this 36 that hadn't been killed or wounded that remained in the platoon right now. So that's what we're talking about here. And again, he's coming in no combat experience. He rolls in and going back to the book, I sensed instantly that he tight grip was required, particularly so, because those few who survived Hill one 12 had witnessed what was without a doubt, the most horrific tragedy that befell the battalion during the entire campaign.

Speaker 3:          00:06:42       So he's about to explain what they had been through. He wasn't there for it, but he knew and he had heard what they had been through. And I'm gonna say that again. This is the most horrific tragedy for the entire campaign. This is what they're coming off of, and this is who he's going to take over for. This is what they had been through back to the book during a, during a company night attack and one of our soldiers had been hit in the lower chest by a rifle or a machine gun, bullet passing through his body. It did not kill them outright.

Speaker 2:          00:07:09       Okay?

Speaker 3:          00:07:10       The bullets devilish course lay through the soldiers webbing equipment pouch, which contained a 77 phosphorous smoke grenade, which exploded, caught on barbed wire. The poor soldier lay disemboweled for all around to see his rising body, uh, smoking mass of burning phosphorus, responding to his agonized screams to put him out of his misery. His platoon commander shot him through the heart and finally through the head after the poor man's final frenzied, please not there, sir. Through the head, Doug proctor was witness to this sublimely courageous incident, which seared itself upon all our hearts.

Speaker 2:          00:08:12       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:08:13       so that's what you're going to take over for Jay. Can you do that? I mean, is that like legal? You know, like if they found out that that happened, I have no idea what the legal ramifications are. But the moral weight on the shoulders of the men that witnessed that is, is unbelievably, it's, it's hard to imagine what that feels like. Back to the book to the NCO Sergeant Jim Kingston and Corporal Doug proctor immediately reported to me and explained forcefully and in great detail the poor state of the platoon as they knew it to be. So you've got these guys, these are the senior enlisted guys in the platoon, Jim Kingston and Doug proctor and you're gonna hear a lot about them and they're coming to him. Here's this new guy checking in and they're coming to them and, and they're, you know, telling him how, what, what a bad state the platoon is in.

Speaker 4:          00:09:10       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          00:09:12       Back to the book. While they did. So I was conscious of being weighed up was I fit to be their platoon commander. They were responsible, anxious, and discriminating owes, that stands for non commissioned officer. It's the senior enlisted guys. And my apprenticeship was to start immediately. They were startled by my attire previously warned by a young officer who'd fought in Tunisia. That battle dress was most unsuitable for Brat battle. I'd come prepared in sand colored corduroy trousers and a stout pullover. Not on like that now worn throughout the army. Among my prejudices was an acute dislike of steel helmets. They gave me headaches on exercises and England. I had been obliged to wear one, but the surge of individualism, which now engulfed me, convinced me that this was an article of equipment best left out of battle.

Speaker 4:          00:10:05       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:10:06       so he's, he shows up and he's Kinda dressed out of uniform, doesn't want to wear his helmet. He's wearing corduroy pants. Back to the book battle schools in England had insisted that off infantry officers should wear the same equipment and dress as their soldiers. The idea being that they could not be then be so easily identified by enemy snipers. They also decreed that one should carry a rifle or a stun gun.

Speaker 3:          00:10:32       Clearly this was ridiculous. How on Earth could your own soldiers recognize you in the heat of battle if you went through such lengths to disguise, he had the same, the same attitude as lieutenant lead and Korea that was wearing the orange vest. Do you remember that? So he could be identified in battle by his own men. That's what this guy's attitude is like. I'm not going to dress like everyone else. They need to be. They need to know who that I'm out there. How can they need to be able to see me back to the book I dispensed with a rifle or sten gone too because I'm hopelessly short sighted and I did not fancy trying to command a platoon while got up like a Christmas tree, meaning covered and a bunch of gear as a concession to impending battle. I sported a 45 Colt automatic pistol with two spare magazines, the 38 Enfield revolver. Then general issue throughout the army managed to combine total mechanical reliability with complete ineffectiveness. Once fired six shots from one at a target pinned to apply with board. None of which even penetrated the board. Neither did I hit the target, which gave me a little confidence in this weapon. The nine pounds I paid for the cult proved a sound investment. So there's a lot of people that like to talk about what type of side arm there. You've got a big proponent for the Colt 45 yeah. The classic,

Speaker 1:          00:11:56       again, important to remember that he's not even carrying a rifle because he knows his job asleep. And I used to do it when we had seals, seal leaders that would spend too much time on their gun. I would say, hey, you know what they used to carry in the Marine Corps and the army if you were a leader, you know what they carry? They carry a pistol.

Speaker 4:          00:12:13       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:12:14       so give me your rifle and we take it from him. Like you, you need to be leading, not shooting.

Speaker 4:          00:12:18       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:12:20       Leif talks about that a lot. Oh yeah. It's very, you know, life talks about his mentality, which was he wants to shoot. Yeah. He's from Texas. You know, he's, he wants to shoot his gun and he realized, Hey, I'm not here to shoot my gun. Yeah. I'm here to, you know, be at high pork and be off my gun and leading. Yeah, that's my job. And these guys took it to the point where they're not even carrying a rifle. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:44       Now he's talking about a senior leadership a little bit. His enlisted leadership back to the book, Jim Kingston was short, quiet and shy with the shoe, does have a countryman. Although he had lived and worked in Bristol all his life. He barely raised his voice but had total command over his section. There was no argument with Jim that that's another thing you'll find about this book, this book. It takes so many stereotypes from, from Sydney, Jerry on down. Like the stereotypes are just out the window of the way this platoon was. And there's a classic example. You know, you've, you picture the senior enlisted guy, there's Bra, you know, gunny highway scenario. Not happening now he can now he talks about Doug proctor back to the book. Doug prop proctor. Although a Summerset came from Nottingham also short, he was positive, direct with unfailing common sense and like Jim quietly dominated his section. So there's another, and I got to see some great leaders. There's some guys that were in warranty, you bruiser that were quiet when they were in to your bruiser and when I was putting them through their next workup, I was thinking myself, hey, are they going to be able to step up and lead? And that's exactly how they did it right there. They were just like quiet, professional and controlling, but they run their mouth to get it done.

Speaker 4:          00:14:05       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:14:08       Back to the book, I had not previously met any platoon like this one. They were quiet, fought ful, and on abrasive soldiers there was little swearing and there existed a tranquility in their relationships with one another.

Speaker 4:          00:14:23       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:23       Their eyes implored me not to fail them. Two factors were immediately apparent. Firstly, the platoon required quiet firm and confident leadership. So that's a good assessment. You can see these guys don't need anybody yelling at them. And here's the second point. Secondly, if I failed to use my imagination and slavish Lee followed the battle school, most of the platoon would not survive another major battle. So all the things he learned, a standard typical stuff that he'd learned that wasn't gonna work and it hadn't worked. That's why they had so many replacements come in back to the book. In fact, the problem that faced me with 18 platoon was identical to the one facing General Montgomery, our army group commander, how to fight and defeat the cream of the ss panzer divisions in the close normal Normandy bull college and still retain sufficient infantry rifleman to live and fight tomorrow.

Speaker 1:          00:15:27       The problem was a difficult one. Obviously I must set an example and always lead from the front. However, if I became overeager and got myself killed or wounded, the whole object of my previous training and my responsibility to my platoon would be cast away. I would in fact be letting down 18 platoon, so he knows he's got to lead from the front the time, same time. He knows he's got to stay alive. He knows you got to stay alive and this Normandy fighting here, he talks about normally d being a defender's paradise, meaning when you're on the defense and Normandy, it's W it's a paradise for the people on Defense, which was the Germans. Back to the book. We fought from one hedge row to the next up, torturous, overgrown sunken lanes, ideal country for the German defender, but appalling for attacking infantry. However, no arm but infantry could take and hold the Norman depot cottage bill conscious like a trees. Shrubs mangled together. It was here that I served my apprenticeship and the platoon developed its character, which despite constant depletion by casualties over the coming 10 months, it would retain until the end of the war. It was also here that imperceptibly I became possessive with 18 platoon. It was mine to be guarded with an almost maternal jealousy that resented all criticism of my soldiers. That's building at this point, most important. It was in the boat cottage that I began to appreciate. How vital is grip

Speaker 1:          00:17:11       grip on oneself, grip on one soldiers and grip on the situation. Unlike characters in novels and films, most men react nervously to real battle conditions, discipline and regimental pride, our supports, but indecisive moments of great danger. The grip of the leader on the led is paramount. Infantry section, platoon commanders must possess the minds and hearts of their soldiers. Strength of character is not enough successful leadership in battle, although complex any intangible always seemed to me to depend on two factors. Firstly, soldiers must have confidence in their leaders, professional ability. And secondly they must trust them as men.

Speaker 1:          00:18:09       So there you go. They got to have confidence in your ability and trust. And this trust topic comes up all the time. And I use the word relationships kind of interchangeably with trust. I always have to remind myself to point that out, that what I'm talking about, relationships and building relationships and business on the battlefield and wife relationships, our trust, that's what they are yet. But we build a relationship on trust. Yeah. And I guess you could have, you know, relationships that aren't built on trust that those are like another thing. Oh, I have a relationship with that guy. But you know. Yeah. So, but that's not, that's the one I'm talking about, right? I'm a good relationships. Yeah. Those are based on trust and those are obviously the most, the second most important thing to him. So first is confidence in their ability and second is trust. I like this part. It helps too. If a leader has the reputation of being lucky field Marshall Montgomery place great importance on the principle of making the enemy dance to your tune. Nowhere is this more important than in platoon and company battle. It is decisive because if you do not dominate events, your enemy will.

Speaker 2:          00:19:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:22       There you go. That's Jujitsu right there. Be First. Yeah. You gotta be first. You got to dictate the pace. You gotta you gotta be proactive.

Speaker 2:          00:19:31       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:19:34       Back to the book. Sound leadership like true love to which I suspect it is closely related is all powerful. It can overcome the seemingly impossible and it's effect on both leader and led is profound and lasting. Even after the passage of 40 years. Brief mention of the battalions finest officers and NCRS brings. It brings a smile to the faces of the survivors of my platoon. There resentment of those who failed to lead when it mattered most still runs astonishing. Lead deep.

Speaker 2:          00:20:11       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:12       So leadership can overcome seemingly impossible. This why leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield.

Speaker 2:          00:20:20       Mm.

Speaker 1:          00:20:22       Now he's going into his, so that's kind of his assessment and this is based on his experience, which we're about to get into. Then he's does more assessments, there's more, more. He talks more about what he learns about leadership as a whole, but you have to kind of understand what he went through and figured out where he learned it from the first, his first command in battle. Here we go back to the book, we were to attack this hill from the west with the fifth wheelchairs on our right and the fourth wheelchairs in reserves. The, the approach march to our forming up place had been a nightmare of swirling abrasive dust shelling and the stench of exhaust fumes from the tanks which transported us forward.

Speaker 4:          00:21:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:06       We were due to attack at 1500 hours with a company leading on the right and be company on the left. We followed B company B Company moved off quickly with our company deployed about 300 yards behind their forward. Platoons had barely crossed the stream when concentrated Spandau fire came from the front and from both flanks. So spend Al Fire. This is kind of a generic term that the Brits used for German machine guns and they're primarily talking about the MG 42 which is a big belt fed machine gun. Very similar to a modern, what we have m 60 or mark, 48 machine going a big heavy belts, belt fed machine gun, which lays down the insane amounts of suppressive fire. So here we go. They're getting hit from both flanks with these machine guns. Back to the book, there must've been about 12 machine guns firing at one time. This devastating display of firepower stopped the battalion dead in its tracks. There was no way forward or around it and no way to retire. Some of the guns had engaged d company over the heads of B Company and private Morrison 18 platoon was killed. So there's his first guy lost.

Speaker 1:          00:22:26       I like this. The way he starts off this next sentence here. First word powerless.

Speaker 4:          00:22:32       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:22:33       So he's in his first combat situations, got one man killed and how's he feel powerless. Here we go. Powerless and crouching and a hedge row. I tried to identify the spanned out positions. This proved impossible as they still kept up. They're crushing display of firepower. In my ignorance, I expected that the enemy machine gunners would soon expand their ammunition. They did not, nor did they in dozens of subsequent battles. So he's waiting for them to stop shooting. They don't. It just keeps coming. Captain Scammell commanding a company was severely wounded. Major Thomas Commanding be company was killed. Their companies were badly caught up on our right. The fifth wheelchairs had fared no better with their CEO killed and casualties mounting their attack. Also foundered.

Speaker 4:          00:23:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:25       As the afternoon turn to evening shelling and mortaring increased much of it passing over our heads. This isolating us from the Reserve Battalion so that the Germans are mortaring over their head so that the reserve battalion can't get to them. Shortly before dark, a troop of tanks arrived, one of which able to cross the stream

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       and give us some brave close support. Undoubtedly it increased our morale, but it was not enough to get the whole attack underway again. Any movement by B Company to our front brought down instant and concentrated Spandau fire.

Speaker 3:          00:24:02       The same applied to us a few hundred yards to their rear. Fortunately, the enemy did not seem to have any anti tank guns, so our armored friends were comparatively safe, but the fact remained that about 12 span dose had halted. A battalion attack without are locating even one of them. That's what suppressive fire does. That's what, that's what a big machine gun does. You've got 12 big machine guns. This stopping 700 people from moving. That's called suppressive fire. That's why you don't, when you heard Roger Hayden talk about how how many heavy weapons they, how many machine guns they'd carry. They, I think they had nine out of a platoon of 14 that's why as dusk fell, a new plan was made. C and d companies would advance in single file through a and B companies and using the cover of darkness, darkness infiltrate the enemy position. Once through them we would climb to the top of the hill and consolidate a cold and damp miss descended, which with fading light gave us welcome cover but also wretched discomfort.

Speaker 3:          00:25:09       We were still in shirt sleeves which became damp from the sweat of our exertion. Climbing the steep lower slopes alert with pistol and hand. I anticipated a sudden brush with an enemy post. Not a shot was fired by some miracle. We passed right through their positions without being to deck detected our luck and changed so you're going to see quite a bit of that is as they what the Germans were doing at this point defending hard, but then instead of staying in dying, in most cases they would retreat and so they'd fight really hard for awhile and then retreat and they advance if they had an opportunity. But you're going to see a lot of that back to the book. We now had to advance across a large orchard, so I deployed the platoon with two sections up and urged them forward as fast as possible. Suddenly in the middle of the orchard, we came across a young girl in a clean white dress sitting with her back to an apple tree sketching.

Speaker 3:          00:26:08       Now I just talked about this at the mustard, the random things that happened in combat and this is what I'm talking about and how do you train for that? How would you ever, if you're running a battle problem to train people, what are you going to do? Put a white girl in a white dress and the sitting with her back to a tree sketching doesn't make any sense. How do you deal with it? Back to the book, she seemed quite oblivious to the mortar fire in 18 platoons warlike appearance, how to stop pretty young girls from interfering with battle had not been part of my training as an officer, Cadet nor headed appeared on the curriculum of any battle schools, which without exception had despaired of my as an infantry soldier. Fortunately, there was a farm house beside the orchard and it had a cellar where she was persuaded to shelter.

Speaker 3:          00:26:52       While we got on with our battle, I reported what had occurred to our company commander who told me that I was being quite ridiculous. Really, Jerry, you're being absurd. With that remark, I realized that he had been a school master, a breed with whom I had been in conflict until quite recently, a breed with whom I'd been in conflict with until quite recently. So this guy has the, the attitude of a schoolmaster, which in England is a little bit different and especially in the 1930s and forties you know the strict, I think of a pink Floyd, you know the headmaster. How can you have any pudding if you don't eat? You meet that guy. That's what he's comparing him to. His next sarcastic remark, I would be obliged, Jerry, if you would kindly get on with the war. He gave me a little indication of what he wanted my platoon to do, nor did it inspire confidence.

Speaker 3:          00:27:46       We were still over 200 yards from the meadow surrounded by cornfields, which was the company's objective. And now became apparent that our company commander had an academic and detached attitude of mind, which made it quite impossible for him to come in the company. So the company, the company commander is not in the game. There's one thing to be detached from your emotions to make sure you're not getting caught up in the mayhem was another thing to be so detached that you're not even aware of what's going on. And actually I had a name for this when I was running training battlefield aloofness is what I called it. Cause we'd get these guys, you get these guys and we'd be running these crazy battlefield problems on them and it'd be not to be crazy. And you'd go, I remember one time there's a, the the task unit commander, there's all this mayhem going on.

Speaker 3:          00:28:32       The platoons are getting overrun and the people are getting, you know, shot with paint ball and they're not hitting their objectives. And I walk over to the company commander. He's sitting in a Humvee, or sorry, the the t you commander, the troop commander. He's sitting in a Humvee and I like the windows up because they're bullet proof windows, but he does want to get shot with paypal. The windows up, he's just sitting in there. He's got his headset on. I was radio like knock on the door. I'm like, hey man, you know what's going on out there? He's like, well I'm, I'm, I'm trying to gather that information right now. And I'm like, Bro, you ain't gonna gather anything here but dust. Yeah, you need to get out there and make something happen. Because his idea was, you know, I need to be detached, which I talk about being detached all the time, but there's a difference between being and as you see the same thing in businesses where the, the, the boss or the leader has no idea what's happening on the ground floor. Right? He doesn't know what the, the workers are doing. So he's so far to attach that he's, he's, you know, let them eat cake. Right. That's where that's where this guy is that because what they just in a way just depend on them to just handle it on their own. They think they're going to handle it on their own, which a good attitude to have

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       until they can't handle it anymore. Right, right. Once they can't, once a, once a team or a platoon or a business unit can't handle it on their own and they're failing. You have to get, you have to go do your job. You have to step up. You have to step down as leader. You have to get in there and square that stuff away. Yeah. Yeah. So it's that without the get there part, right. It's just like, all right, call me when it's done. And, and, and the problem is somebody has got to sort these problems out. Yeah. Yeah. They're, they're, they're real. Yeah. And they're not getting better. And you might take you a minute to go, okay, wait a second. This, these, these problems aren't getting better. What should I do? Once you realize that they're not getting better, you've got to get in there and make it happen.

Speaker 2:          00:30:21       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:30:24       This guy's not doing that. Back to the book, he'd be behaved like a supercilious umpire on an exercise in England at any moment. I expected him to admonish me for bad tactics and the school boy and me feared that I might be sent to the headmaster for a beating. So they continue on. We seize the highest point which face the enemy and the other platoons quickly deployed to give all around a fence of the other flanks after being mortared. The company required no encouragement to dig in. It's a real motivator. Getting mortared will make you shovel hard and yeah, the company commander walked round the platoon positions, eyeing everyone with distaste, nothing pleased him and he suddenly announced that he must sleep, which he did in my slit trench. Getting not a good feeling about this company commander. Just looking at everyone like negatively and then all of a sudden he wants to sleep. I don't like this guy. And of course he sleeps in in my trench. Now this is good. There's another officer that's there that's present, a guardian angels watching over us in the guise of Dennis Clark. Dennis some years older than me was exceptionally kind to me and tolerant of my immaturity.

Speaker 1:          00:31:45       Pay Attention. This is good. He took my, took me by the arm a few paces away from my platoon. Who the hell is in command of this shambles? Sunny, I muttered the unconvincing explanation that it was our company commander looking me straight in the eye. He drew a deep breath, which managed to express both exasperations at my explanation and sympathy with my predicament. You and I know that he is not. So what are you going to do about it?

Speaker 2:          00:32:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:18       I asked him if I should take command his expression hardened. Yes. You bloody well. Should some demonstration of loyalty to my wretched company commander was obviously required. I blurted out that he was really a school master and not a professional soldier, so he's kind of defending him. Dennis put his arm around my shoulder and whispered in my year, so was eyes sunny,

Speaker 1:          00:32:45       so that's awesome. The company commander is not leading and this this guy, Dennis Clark, who I think he's, um, artillery. Gunner pulls. This guy's a scientist, bro. You better take charge of this. And you better do it. Quick. Back to the book, we were now, well dug in on our objective. The company commander was still asleep. Dennis was arranging defensive fire tasks for me. I hit assumed command of d company without a word passes in between our company commander in me in practice. It may not the slightest difference because, because like a bad preparatory school master, he saw his role as one of examination and criticism.

Speaker 2:          00:33:33       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:33:33       This he continued to do despite the incredulous stairs of the NCS. So he's taking charge and and he hasn't even said anything. He's just done it. He just took charge and all the guy, the guys continue to walk around, get stare, glared everyone. But that doesn't matter. So this is a classic example. Your leaders not leading. I, I've given this answer. It's so many times, but this is a classic. This might be one of the best examples. Your leaders not leading. That's fine. Good step up and lead yourself. Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:34:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:04       Back to the book by Don. The enemy had retired and elements of the battalion moved forward to consolidate and strength and d companies position. The whole operation was very amateur. There was no doubt that the new company commander could not command a company in battle, nor could I who is just beginning to master the rudiments of commanding couple tune. He was removed within a few hours. I think Dennis had something to do with it, but he was not the kind of man to confide in 20 year old sub alternates. So that's another classic thing right there is that this Guy Dennis, who was another uh, officer probably went and said, get this Guy Outta here, get this company commander out of here. But when he does it, the company commander gets removed and, and he doesn't say anything to Sydney. Jerry, he doesn't, you know, ratted out or brag about or make a big deal.

Speaker 1:          00:34:54       He doesn't say anything just happens. It's like when I had a mutiny and my platoon and the commanding officer's like, no, we're not firing anyone. You guys get Outta here. Shut your mouse and go back to work. And we were like, okay. And then a few days, like a week later he got fired, but we, it wasn't because of us as far as we know. Right. Like no one's anything. We just knew he got fired. Yeah. Well, what reason? We knew we had something to do with it, but same thing. So you don't need to create a distrust in disloyalty and, and not even just those words, but you don't need to create drama. Yeah. Right. Don't treat the drama. Yeah. That guy's going to going somewhere is getting built it somewhere else. Hey, you guys won everybody. Yeah. Yeah. We're not doing that. We're not doing that. We're not up our own ego

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       by disparaging someone else's. Let's worry about the whole team. How's that sound? Sounds like a good idea to me. Back to the book, I now have little doubt that for the first two months in Normandy, we lack two things. Comprehensive and imaginative training and personal experience of battle. We were all so seriously handicapped by our casual attitude. Too many junior officers did not think for themselves and persistently relied on the narrow teaching of battle schools whose dogma had assumed the proportion of holy writ. So whatever he was taught, he was taught that that's the only way you can ever do it. And these guys that I've talked about this many times on the, on the podcast, the goal when I was running training was to actually get the people to think it wasn't sure. You have to establish the baseline standard operating procedures. That's great and those need to be rock solid.

Speaker 3:          00:36:31       But once those things are established, you need to make people understand that you don't always follow them and you need to call off a piece of that standard operating procedure to insert some other thing and bring in another per standard operating procedure and mix and match them so that you get something that's effective. You need to think that's what a leader needs to do at leader needs to think back to the book. The British infantry platoons and companies were overtrained and bored stiff with basic infantry tactics, which as far as they went, we're good. Much of this training unfortunately had been in the hands of battle school instructors who themselves lacked battle experience and imagination. These tended to become pedagogues, disciples of ds directing staff solution about which no argument could be tolerated. So DSS is that he'd be, he mentioned it a bunch. It's like that's their solution.

Speaker 3:          00:37:22       The directing staff, you can't argue with them. They're the, they're the cadre. Yeah. Possibly. Like most of our entry infantry, they suffered some consequences of the prewar shortage of creativity. Intelligent regimental officers, too. Few of them were professionally dedicated to the extent that they could visualize how battles will be fought and identify the problems that might arise when planning them. They seem to lack the capacity to think relentlessly through these things until solutions were found. Much of their time had been spent policing the British empire. Also, unlike the Germans, we British instinctively avoid displays of keenness. The enthusiast, particularly if he is innovative, isn't embarrassment. Thus the battlefield became our teacher and inevitably it exacted a grim price in blood and time. So as you're training, you got to push yourself hard. You've got to put yourself in situations. I don't care what you're training for. I don't care if you're training for combat in a seal platoon, in an army, infantry platoon, or if in the business world and you're training your leaders to handle situations or you're training your customer service reps to handle situations, no matter which one of those you're in, you need to push people hard. You need to put them in worst case scenario so that they need to learn how they need to learn how to think to get out of those problems.

Speaker 4:          00:38:53       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:38:55       I recall with embarrassment and incident at 45th infantry divisional battle school during the spring of 1944 and exceptionally tall and good natured Canadian officer had been sent to the school to give a talk on the street fighting. He had experienced natally. It was an interesting talk, but some of his advice ran contrary to that being taught in the school.

Speaker 4:          00:39:18       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:39:19       When the lecture was over, the chief instructor with insulting condensation, thank this shy and kindly man for a vivid word picture and turning to the student's warned us that at as this officer's experience was probably unusual. We had best not stray from the DAS solution.

Speaker 4:          00:39:41       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:39:41       As taught at that school. So you've got to combat veteran coming back with experience from street fighting in Italy.

Speaker 4:          00:39:50       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:39:50       And he'd come back with some different tactics and they tell him that you don't listen to that guy. That's just a rare case. Closed mind will get you killed.

Speaker 4:          00:40:03       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:40:04       This is starting to talk about their overall sort of formulation of combat plans and how they operated. Back to the book. The most successful actions by 18 platoon were fought without the support of artillery or armor. We had learned in a hard school how to skirmish, infiltrate, and edge our way forward, the right or left flanking platoon attack. So beloved of the battle school staff would rarely succeed in the Normandy bocage. I remember with horror being locked into timetables of meticulously planned large battles, these invariably left the junior infantry commander, no scope for exploitation. If you found a gap in the enemy defenses, adherence to artillery program, which rarely could be altered, effectively stopped any personal initiative. So what that's saying is you have these, the artillery that's going to drop bombs, they're going to bomb or strike with artillery at certain regions and certain times. So Lee, you might see the enemy running away and you have a chance to gain a superior tactical position, but you can't because you know that that's where the bombs are going. That's where the artillery is gonna be hitting in the next 12 minutes. So you can't go. So now you sit and wait.

Speaker 3:          00:41:18       So he got locked in by that back to the book. To me, the preparations for these battles assumed the demented proportion of a Koffka liked nightmare ballet in which the anonymous they ordained that we must perform a choreographed at ritual dance. Mccobb I felt trapped and helpless. No Solo parts were written into the score, nor was there scope for small groups of performers and this man of ballet of machines undoubtedly far shadows from the psalm that the battle of Somme clouded my emotions. But instinct told me that this kind of show would be unlikely to succeed. The irony was that this support was planned and given to the infantry. Would the best of intentions. The Psalm had cast its shadows on our artillery and armored commanders both genuinely believed that their hands, they, that in their hands they had the panacea which would protect us, the infantry from the terrible slaughter of 1916 instead they put us in a straight jacket. So very interesting viewpoint. And, and it's something that we need to pay attention to because you've got to be flexible. You gotta be flexible and that's exactly what he's talking about. And these, they would make these plans that were so comprehensive and there was no, you weren't allowed to deviate from the plants. And when you're not allowed to deviate from the plans and it's something starts going differently than what you expected, you're trapped.

Speaker 4:          00:42:48       Yeah. Telephone

Speaker 3:          00:42:54       back to the book, far too much time had been spent fitting the infantry and armor junior leaders into the big picture and too little time spent training them and stimulating their imagination and initiative and individual resourcefulness to probe, draw conclusions, infiltrate and exploit weaknesses in the enemy's dispositions. So He's, he's criticizing this lack of initiative, lack of creativity and the training to get that initiative and creativity back to the book after the 1st of August, 18 platoon never failed in any attack. Sometimes we took a little longer than planned, but we always got there in the end in defense, we never lost one yard of ground, nor did the enemy ever penetrate our platoon position. And we always dominated no man's land with our patrols. Whether persistent patrolling is always sound policy, I will argue elsewhere.

Speaker 4:          00:43:53       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:43:54       so he's saying once he kind of figured it out, they didn't lose any more. They didn't lose any attacks and they didn't give up any ground. It talks about the armor. Our armor was accused of being tiger shy, meaning scared of the Tiger tanks and the Germans. And I don't wonder why the devastation caused by a single hit of an 88 millimeter armor piercing shell needed to be seen to be believed. And this is an overall statement for the infantry and armor, the British Second Army, the sheer ferocity of the fighting in Normandy came as a salad tour. Solitary shock for which they were in some ways unprepared. So it was devastating for these guys. Now we start pushing out out of uh, out of normality and pushing into the CNE.

Speaker 2:          00:44:47       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:44:48       and here we go. They're pushing in the next day, 28, August d company occupied a Hara court. This is the only operation of war that I ever known to go precisely as planned, are supporting field regiment softened up the objective with their 25 pounders, the company advanced over Open Farm Land and immaculate formation and consolidated exactly on time. The only thing lacking was an enemy total bag, one days to German, one dead German and one dead hair rabbit. Right. So the only one that ever went well was when there was no enemy to fight against. There was, there was two Germans, one of them was dead, the other one was dazed and that was their, their last battle in France.

Speaker 3:          00:45:39       Back to the book experience in Normandy had removed anxieties regarding commanding and under strength platoon. So he hasn't had enough man. He's supposed to have 36, he's had like 17, 18, 19. In the attack, particularly at night. Apple tune at full strength is just too big to maneuver quickly. Three rifle sections of about 20 above about seven men each plus headquarters was ideal in defense. It was a different matter. The more riflemen on the ground, the better or short stay in lamence Sal Milan gave me time to think the first opportunity to do so since I took command of 18 platoon. It also gave me time to meet and talk with other young officers in the battalion. It was then that I realized that 18 platoon was no ordinary platoon. It had some undefinable magic, no corals, little swearing. Despite the war. That was the, despite the war, there was something peaceful about it. A helping hand was always available for anybody. The emotional links were from and true. I was a happy man, so he realizes and once he starts talking to the other platoon commanders, he's got this really special platoon that gets along great and he's, he realizes it back to the book. No young officer can command a platoon in battle on his own. In Normandy. I'd seen platoon commanders served by poor NCO struggling to gain some semblance of control over their bewildered and frightened men.

Speaker 3:          00:47:19       I'd also seen platoons with good end CEOs go to pieces in the hands of an indifferent officer, Jim Kingston, Doug proctor and Owen Cheesman set this standard and tone for 18 platoon. Without them, I as the platoon commander would have joined the ranks of so many poor young officers who never achieved grip.

Speaker 4:          00:47:47       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:47:48       Now going to

Speaker 3:          00:47:53       another and he's putting together another plan as they're advancing it, and obviously this is a long book. I'm doing an abridged version, hitting some highlights. You should get the book. I obviously get the book, buy the book back to the book at Zero 400 hours on 24th of September. Douglas, this is the new company commander Douglas Douglas held along Oh group by candle light in the cellar of the farmhouse at w, which much to his annoyance, I kept falling asleep. We were ordered to advance straight eastward down a narrow country lane from the orchard to the main road and consolidate after the Oh group and [inaudible] group is what they call it. Like when they're, when they're officers get together and pass the word and they called Oh group. After the o group, I made myself unpopular by asking why were advancing towards an area of considerable German opposition when my patrol had found a better route by which we might outflank the enemy.

Speaker 3:          00:48:53       So that, so he's saying, Hey, wait, why? Cause at his Pulitzer, all his platoon had been out on a patrol and found a better route and he's asking why and he kind of gets shut down. I was just 20 years old at the time. And even then I knew I was incapable of disputing orders without giving offense. We started at zero 600 hours, two platoons leading on either side of the track, the third falling in single file down the track itself on either side where the small holdings were small holdings, a few allotments and bungalows surrounded by small picket fences. But platoons advanced through the gardens and vegetable patches and passed on either side of the bungalows, the rear section searching each one quickly

Speaker 3:          00:49:38       and while they're searching, these little bungalows is there on patrol. They find this back to the book during one of these hurried searches, one section found a Dutch family, the Wittich's father, mother, son and daughter, riddled by Schmidt's or fire. That's a German machine gun. They lay an awkward postures of Def amid their ransacked home visit from the SS. No tears came, nor did they come a half an hour later when we came upon the charred wreckage of an American Dakota, it had carried us parachute troops to the 82nd airborne division and they're torn and burnt bodies littered the orchard like charred and mutilated rag dolls.

Speaker 4:          00:50:24       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:50:25       There was a further irony

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       attached to the front window and what remained of the Dakotas cockpit was a tiny teddy bear untouched by flames two months before a lonely teddy bear and an impersonal pool of blood had brought forth tears. Now I was collected and objective when faced within the span of 30 minutes with an atrocious murder and mass carnage by fire. And he's referring there in the beginning of the book, one of his first experiences, he's by a slit trench and there's a dead guy soldier in it and there's a little teddy bear. And, and for some reason, you know, he's young, he's inexperienced and it gets, gets, makes him super emotional. He starts crying and, and now he's a little further in the war. He sees, you know, this horrible murdered family and these tragically, you know, burned and killed paratroopers and he's able to detach emotionally from it. Back to the book, the enemy decided to make life unpleasant for us as possible by sudden unpredictable concentrations of heavy artillery. Right in the middle of our company area. We called them stocks. So he's going to use that word. It just means we're getting bombed. One of these shells unfortunately fell right into one of 16 platoon slit trenches.

Speaker 1:          00:51:56       No trace remained of the two men that were manning in it. Manning a Bren in my platoon, Lance Corporal Jack Lee and private Peter, filmer or buried in the trench. They shared other members of their section quickly dug them out unharmed, very dirty and remarkably cheerful. The self propelled guns, increase their activities, filling the sky above the company with ugly black air bursts.

Speaker 4:          00:52:26       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:52:27       they could place these with uncanny accuracy to burst about 25 feet above the road junction, outside company headquarters, the casualties mounted company Sergeant Major Sammy Jones and spot Martin. The jeep Burke driver were both hit outside company HQ. It was Sammy Jones who committed the battalion's only atrocity. Late one summer evening as the shadows from high trees and hedges fell across a small field and Normandy. We took some young Waffen Salt Waffen SS soldiers prisoner. One of them are short, stocky, and fair. Youth of about 18 proved insultingly truculent seizing the young lout by the scruff of his neck. Samari roared. You can take that Glenn out of your eyes, my boy, and putting the wretched youth across his knees. He gave his backside a sound wacky that is legit. And that's again, uh, you know, Sydney. Jerry and he talks about how proud he is that his men, it's men's behavior is so upstanding throughout this whole miserable experience.

Speaker 1:          00:53:45       And even when they see atrocities committed, like by the SS, they still maintain their discipline and their character. And this is, this is what he does. Oh, you, you're a little punk kid. I'm going to spank you. You tough little SS soldier can put over the knee and spanked. So after the attack, so now there's, this is again, this is happening after one of these attacks and, and the whole, the whole basic premise of this book is attack, rest, attack, rest, attack, rest. So as I'm reading, I'm kind of picking out some of the attacks that they're going on and they're just moving through France and then through Germany. That's what it is. I should have explained that earlier. Uh, but this is after one of the attacks. It's interesting. He says this smiling faces vanished. And the gray look returned once more men walked with one ear, cocked in the air for approaching shells and with a slight stoop.

Speaker 1:          00:54:47       If you remember what I remember I was talking about JP and I was talking about how like you'd see guys, they have this natural little stoop. Yeah, yeah. That's what he's talking about. And Jp didn't happen. No stoop. Jp standing up like you stupid. He was not. Yeah, he was stupid. He you standing up ready to get some. But these guys as an, it's contrast because when they're on the attack, they go into like JP mode. They're standing up straight, the ready to get some, but then once they're on the defense and they're just waiting to get shelled, they start to stoop. They started crouch a little bit. He continues back to the book. The jokes began to Peter out and the cheerful, good morning sir ceased when I went around the platoons at stand too. Morale was always hired during an attack, sitting around and being shelled is not an occupation to be recommended. So there's a good lesson there. If do you or your team is being defensive about things, your morale is going to go down because you're waiting to get hit. So go out and hit somebody, you know, go on the attack. Don't wait around. Don't let your morale drown.

Speaker 2:          00:55:57       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:56:03       Here's another attack. Back to the book. Scrambling out of the Colbert, we set a fast pace up the side of the road to a company's positions. This immediately brought small arms fire down on us, but by then we were then 200 yards of their slit trenches. So on. We ran as fast as we could being soaked. I began

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       to steam my boots, squelched and seem to drag me back, calling it my feet as it a bad dream and stopping me from reaching the inviting cover of the slit trenches. A company was dug in with two platoons forward in an orchard face to face with the enemy who were in dykes only a few yards beyond. The third platoon was to the right rear protecting the open flank and company headquarters to the left rear centered on some farm buildings. It was to these farm buildings that we ran hurling ourselves onto the straw on the barn floor. We lay panting and gasping for breath. John a cock, a company commander appeared round the door of the barn. He looked haggard and ward. I doubt he had slept for a week. The whole company area was covered by the most intense Spandau fire and defensive and the defensive battle here was one of fire supremacy, which the Germans had undoubtedly one, a company's morale was low. They had just lost Harry Barnes, one of the platoon commanders who refusing to take cover strutted about in his usual manner. He took a complete burst of Spandau fire under the arm. Harry was an amazing and fearless fellow who didn't care a damn for anything. Even after the burst hit him, he still lived for about three hours.

Speaker 3:          00:57:53       The men respected Harry and with their idol shot down in front of them, they were very jumpy.

Speaker 2:          00:58:03       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:58:04       Nother time you have to watch out for morale, obviously. Now,

Speaker 2:          00:58:12       okay,

Speaker 3:          00:58:13       if you remember, this book started in the summertime and now we're starting to get towards fall and this, this was something I'd never thought about before. When fall comes, you know the sun is up for a shorter period of time. Three. Here we go. Back to the book. The knights became longer and the dawn's gray and chilly. The sunsets were red and vivid and the days though beautiful shortened rapidly as the knights lengthened the hours of stag lengthened and with them the mental and physical fatigue of the company, so they have to stay after, stay up, you know, go rotate through watches at night. You just don't get to sleep the whole time. So if it's, if it's dark for longer, you got to stay awake longer at night. So it's starting to wear on the company itself. Back to the book, there was, there is one incident, small room that when remembered by itself in a life of such incidents, but very, but to me very vivid in my platoon, there was a young lad aged 18 named Biddle.

Speaker 1:          00:59:23       He was slight of build fair and looked a mere child. He had a pleasant personality and it was liked by everyone. He had joined the company at Lawmen Sell Milan after we had crossed the CN at Vernon in August one morning. There was a crack in a short interval of silence. Soon the shout went out. Stretcher bearers echoed through the orchard. I ran towards the commotion and saw Biddle writhing in agony on the ground.

Speaker 2:          01:00:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:03       At first he looked on hurt, but as I tore open his tunic, I saw clear wound through his abdomen coming out by a spine. He soon became numb and was no longer in pain, but was very frightened and shivered. We dragged him back behind the house and applied field dressings to his stomach and his back in case the wound started to bleed. Is young life solely ebbing from his body? Our stretcher bearers quietly and reverently carried him away. The scene is now to poignant to remember without shedding a tear after Biddle had been evacuated, the morale of the platoon dropped. He had been hit while standing in his slit trench by a sniper at least 300 yards away. And you know, it's, it's interesting, and I didn't go into this part, but there's a part earlier in the book where he, he basically disparages somewhat the use of snipers and he talks about how they usually don't gain you anything tactically.

Speaker 2:          01:01:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:31       But it's interesting what it does to the morale of apple tune, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          01:01:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:37       And He, you know, he doesn't complete. No, he, he, he explains that there's usage. Then there's, believe me, there's probably no bigger believer in the use of snipers in the world than me, but it's interesting, you know, he, he basically, you can tell he's a very, uh, a guy with, you know, this extremely high moral character and he kind of gets the feeling when he explains it that, you know, he didn't feel comfortable with sniping because people aren't expecting it. There's not a battle happening. He felt like he was a cheap shot. Hmm. Interesting. But it's interesting the effect that it actually has on his platoon in this moment

Speaker 3:          01:02:19       here. We're going to get to a point, he's got, Germans are in a dyke, they're just ahead of it. 18 platoon and 18 platoon is kind of pin down. And remember this character from earlier, Dennis Clark, Dennis Clark was the, was the guy that pulled him aside and said, hey, you need to take Amanda this company. Well, like I said, Dennis Clark, or I thought I remembered I was right. Dennis Clark was a, was an artillery guy that called in artillery, so here we go. Back to the book, I was saved by Captain Dennis Clark Mc, our team gunner. Dennis had a virtuoso touch where 25 pounders, we're concerned sniping with one gun that should get the buggers out. He said with total confidence moving his 19 set into my, that's a radio moving as 19 set into my platoon position. No easy task and daylight. He gave us a display of the most brilliant professionalism we had come to expect from the 94th field regimen by firing with only one gun and making his main point of impact beyond the dike containing the Germans.

Speaker 3:          01:03:25       He slowly decreased the d range yard by yard until one shell exploded in the dike. Out came five very wet and shaken pans are granted deers. During this episode, all the platoon had to remain in the bottom of their slit trenches because Dennis shells came over our positions with minimum clearance. I doubt if any experienced infantry officer would deny that the royal artillery during the Second World War where the most professionally competent people in the British army. So again, an interesting dichotomy because in the beginning he talks about how the artillery can track them because it's being used in this broad plan that's locking in where there's no deviation. But here he's talking about how brilliant it is because he's directly coordinating with it. He's explaining to the artillery officer where to put those rounds, what the problem is, and then letting the artillery officer's solvent. So there's a dichotomy there. Just like there's a dichotomy with the snipers

Speaker 3:          01:04:34       back to the book. After a few more days in the orchard, we were becoming increasingly exhausted and are fighting efficiency deteriorated. This condition existed not only in my company but throughout the battalion. Consequently, the news of a move back to rest came as a colossal, colossal relief to us all, but we did not know who is going to take over our positions. The takeover was to be at night and was to be carried out as quickly as possible. If the enemy discovered it, a determined attack could cause endless confusion and slaughter. During the late afternoon of one particularly unpleasant day, Douglas appeared that's a company commander, appeared with an American captain and two lieutenants from a parachute battalion of the hundred and first airborne division. They pad it around the company Area and they're rubber soled boots with the eyes or the whole company following them, so the hundred and first is coming in to relieve them having record ordered our area, the Americans returned to the company HQ to discuss administrative points for the takeover.

Speaker 3:          01:05:34       The plan was for the American company commander to bring his company down the main road in single file along the edge of the ditch. When the head of the column reached our company Hq, it would be met by guides from each of our pl tunes to lead the American platoons, their positions. As soon as they were on the ground, our platoons were withdraw and assemble on the road. This may sound simple in practice at, but at night in close contact with the enemy, it certainly was not. This type of operation leaves to companies particularly vulnerable. During the handover, a determined enemy could attack and turn the operation into a massacre. This is one of, and I've said this before on the podcast, so one of the hardest things to do is link up with friendly forces on the battlefield and if you're under fire, it's, it's even harder.

Speaker 3:          01:06:22       So this one, they're trying to do it, not under fire, trying to sneak in, make it happen back to the book. The rest of the day was spent packing, making sure the enemy noticed nothing of this anti activity. We put our spare rounds ammunition onto the carriers with great coats and blankets. The whole afternoon was strangely quiet. There was no activity from the enemy and we in turn kept quiet. The Sun went down and made a fiery sky. Looking east, the sky was threateningly gray. I went around, I went round my position too with Sergeant Kingston before the Americans arrived. All my men look tired and could hardly muster a smile. As I went from slit the slit, many had contained two men and now contained only one together with some Momento of his former mate, a mess tin or a blood stain jacket, even a packet of cigarettes, wet and limp with do. I wondered how many more momentos would be there when the Americans were relieved.

Speaker 3:          01:07:29       About an hour later, the Americans arrived. They loomed up in the darkness by the road side, padding along and the rubber soled boots without a whisper. I thought at the time what splendid troops they were and how excellent their equipment. I was particularly impressed by the silent and quick way they were led by their squad commanders to our section positions. So there come the Americans to relieve him. The hundred and first Airborne Division who's just outstanding soldiers. They're just awesome and we worked with them. It'd be one of my platoons in Ramadi, worked with, lived with them the first of five oh six the band of brothers, and you can tell they're the reputation that the guys in Ramadi upheld that standard in every possible way. But it's rooted all the way back to the soldiers right here. Sounds like this is what struck me when I read that I was like all this, this, that, that tradition of excellence in that unit has gone from World War II, from these guys right here, and it's that same attitude that I saw with guys and Ramadi, this same attitude.

Speaker 4:          01:08:42       Hmm. All right.

Speaker 3:          01:08:48       Now he makes a statement here about this whole big operation, which was called market garden, which was this giant operation to try and cut off. The Germans sees multiple bridges. I can give us three bridges they were trying to seize and it, it didn't reach its full effect. It wasn't like a complete mission success. They didn't achieve every objective that they wanted to. So here we go. Back to the book. Market Garden was a sad operation. Complete success coming so close at a stroke. The war in Europe could have been finished in 1944 undoubtedly, mistakes were made both by the first airborne division, particularly their planners, and also by 30 core and there was no shortage of bad luck. However, in my experiences, in my experience, most battles are riddled with misfortunes and mistakes. And the story of the sort found in this operation, it was not a failure because the ground was taken and a prerequisite to both operation veritable and the Rhine crossing.

Speaker 3:          01:09:54       So it wasn't like a total failure. Back to the book. I'm convinced that had the supreme commander General Eisenhower Given Market Garden, the unqualified support that it justified, it would have totally succeeded despite its crop of tactical errors and planning and execution. I suppose it was just one more casualty of the American mania for dispersal of effort. However, it was without a doubt the most exciting and imaginatively planned battle in which 18 platoon ever fought. And I'm proud to have taken part. So he's talking about folks of effort. He's talking about you. If you spread yourself out too thin, you're not gonna, you're not gonna make it happen. We call that prioritize and execute. What's the biggest priority? Let's put our resources there.

Speaker 4:          01:10:38       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          01:10:40       They didn't do that and therefore didn't get a full mission success. Now, of course, what resources were there? What was available? There's no one has on limited resources. No one, if you have that, you have no issues, right? Yeah. And you're just crushed problems with manpower. All right. So now they're moving beyond market garden and planning, uh, that actually planning. He's planning a, a patrol through a village. Back to the book battle school teaching at the time prescribed a strength of 12 to 20 for a fighting patrol. Here again, my instincts and experience did not conform to their teaching. He's a rebel.

Speaker 3:          01:11:24       How can you command and control that number of men in the dark, particularly in a skirmish? Douglas, the company commander, tolerant of the absent absency of my opinions on these matters left the planning to me. So cool. Douglas's little these centralized command. Did you figure out your plan then? I like this. The composition of the patrol I based on personalities and not on a battle school, they're ordained number. So imagine that you're, you're planning based into on the personalities of the individuals. You have the countryside being comparatively open. I decided to take a Bren gun being steady. Williams and filmer would fill the bill admirably.

Speaker 3:          01:12:06       If we ran into trouble, they could provide covering fire for any assault we might make or if things went badly, they could cover our withdrawal covering move. Obviously the assault party required strengthening, so I decided to take a total patrol strength of six men. One Bren with seven magazines and three arms with statins were five magazines and four 36 grenades each plus a pair of wire cutters. I carried my colt four grenades and an umbrella. My umbrella had been a source of amusement to the platoons since I had found it on the roadside and moocs apart from keeping me dry in or out of a slit trench. It was useful when prodding for mines and brought some fun and color to our lives. Jim Kingston and Doug proctor fought otherwise maintaining a disapproving silence, which I failed to notice, so now they're out on patrol. Moving down the bank to the right, we crawled forward in the mud and wet grass until we were almost past the orchard from which came the sound of digging and voices. Suddenly a challenge came from our front, followed by a shower of stick grenades thrown from a trench just inside the orchard on our left. One of the grenades landed between my legs, which were stretched out and spread apart. As I lay flat on the river bank. There was no flash. It's explosion seemed muffled and more importantly, owing to the soft mud I received, not a scratch.

Speaker 3:          01:13:33       The game was up. Now the concentrated fire of the three stands poured into the German, into the surprise. Germans putting away my pistol, I threw three 36 grenades in quick succession into the orchard, hurriedly reaching for my umbrella, which alluded me. And then ignominiously ignominiously we beat a retreat. So

Speaker 2:          01:13:57       okay,

Speaker 3:          01:13:57       he gets our gray throw at them. And I actually had this happen to you bruiser. Some guys were out on a patrol. They were an open field. They had cover from one side because they had preplanned how they're going across this field and while they're out there, they got hit with machine gun fire and then mortars. And they got mortars date on them. And luckily because it was, they weren't in like a muddy field,

Speaker 3:          01:14:23       like almost rice patty scenario. The mortars, when they hit, they went into the mud and so they exploded, but there was no, all the disruption was all absorbed by the mud. That's lucky day for tea. You bruiser right there. Boys were little little fired up when they came back from that one. Now they get back into a defensive perimeter. I remember nights and defensive positions like grosbeak stretched out in a slit trench trying to get an hour sleep before going round the platoon positions to check that everything and everyone was all right. One felt and was dirty and in the small hours of the morning with boot laces cutting into swollen feet of foul tasting mouth and an aching stomach, life had little to commend it. The dirt and discomfort worried me more than the danger danger. For some reason that I've never understood exhilarates, but despite every effort to keep clean, it did not always prove possible and that was unbearable. Never once since I never once since have I not been grateful to sink into a hot bath or slide into a bed with clean sheets. We went to extraordinary lengths to keep the dirt at bay. Once in Normandy, I washed and shaved in the rain water in the deep ruts made by carts.

Speaker 3:          01:15:45       Afterwards I discovered that 400 yards away, the opposition had been overlooking my absolutions a decent lot, who obviously approved of my personal hygiene. So if they didn't kill him, Hey, this guy's just trying to be clean. Let's let him continue back to the book. During the campaign, 18 platoon carried out three types of patrols, reconnaissance standing and fighting. The first two in variably useful because they provided information if only negative fighting patrols of which I led. Many were different and contemptuous proposition. Unlike the German and American armies. We had a vigorous policy regarding fighting patrols, particularly at night, and when things were static on both sides on the defense. The thinking behind this policy seemed to me at times to be superficial and probably leftover from the Great War World War One. If when detailed for a fighting patrol young officer's queried the wisdom of its given object, there was always the standard reply. I quite agree with you, but it all helps to dominate no man's land. There is undoubtedly a certain validity of this argument, but was it worth the consequent loss of good young officers and CEO's? I doubt it.

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       Shortly after the war, I was able to briefly voice my reservations to my illustrious army group commander. That's Montgomery. By the way, after giving me my Mc that's military cross ribbon, he stepped back and said, crisply patrolling is bloody, isn't it? When I stammered, that it seemed a bit hard that it was always the same people chosen for patrols. He replied with a twinkle in his eye. One day you'll command a battalion and you'll understand the problem for 20 year olds. Sub Alternate Exchange like this with a field marshal was heady stuff, but Monty's mischievous humor and utter lack of compacity coupled with this single minded professionalism, professionalism extended his personal influence to the most junior soldier in 21st army group. We felt we knew him and that he knew us often he did. So that's a great little interaction. You know, he says patrolling is bloody work isn't it? And and Sydney, Jerry says, yeah and the thing is it seems like it's always the same tunes that get made to do the patrolling and he says one day when you're in charge of Italian you'll understand why that is and the reason why that is cause you've got the good guy and that's the guy you're going to send out. You're going to rely on the people that get it done.

Speaker 1:          01:18:49       Well this is an interesting, we've got another patrol that they're getting ready to have to go out on and the patrol was to pro between the roads and advance if possible. As far as the forest beyond this, it's purpose was indeed vague. Douglas called me and another platoon commander to company HQ and explained it to us. He then suggested we should toss a coin for it. An embarrassing situation arose. I thought that the winner would lead the patrol. The other officer had dissipated that the loser would. I lost the toss and got the job. So, so imagine that you and me are saying, all right, there's a dangerous patrol we're going to have to do. Let's flip for it. I'm thinking heads. If I win, I get to do the patrol. You're thinking in your view when you don't have to do the patrol? Uh, not everyone was quite as fired up, I guess Sydney Jerry was

Speaker 1:          01:19:46       and they, they wrap up a relatively kind of uneventful patrol, relatively uneventful patrol, and he returns and they're having a cup of tea and some biscuits. Sure. In true British form, back to the book, it was then that I suddenly realized that I'd been commanding 18 platoon for months to be precise. Three months and two days before I joined the battalion in mid July, I had been worn, worn that my life expectancy would be about three weeks. It seems strange to me now, but at no time did I anticipate being either wounded or killed. I was just too busy for thoughts like these and I become totally absorbed in my grim responsibilities. In July, I had been written by doubt about my ability in my innocence. I'd expected success in battle to be the prerogative of a victor low Durham, which is like the champion. I now had no such doubts or illusions. Furthermore, I discovered just how much soldiers resent and fear a young officer who sees battle as a means to win his spurs possibly at the cost of their lives. So when you grow in and you're Mr beating your chest and you are who you're going to prove yourself to the world. Yeah, don't be that guy cause you're going to write checks with my life and we don't like that.

Speaker 1:          01:21:27       My duty had become clear to me it was to command 18 platoon with quiet confidence providing I made them only once. My mistakes would be forgiven if my soldiers were to go, we're going to place their very lives in my hands. They in return, we're criers of me, a serious attitude to my profession.

Speaker 1:          01:21:53       If I could achieve this with a light touch so much the better. That's an interesting comment. So you know, he's saying look what they require. Is that going to be serious? I'm got to be as serious as possible. And the, it's like you ever heard the term minimum force required? Yeah. You read, you probably use that as a bouncer, right? Yeah. Hey, you got to use the minimum force required. So what he's saying is that as a leader, the lighter touch, the better, the lightest touch you can use to lead is better. That's a pretty cool statement. That's a good thing to think about.

Speaker 1:          01:22:29       How can you lead with minimum force every time you go you use more than you, then you need your, you're overexerting right. And who knows what kind of, you know you're taken away initiative. You might be stamping out morale. So lead with that minimum touch. I like that. So at this point they're in a, they're in a position and there's three of these. Mark three 75 millimeter self propelled gone. So they kind of look like tanks. They got big tracks, they're Germans, they're German, and their end, they're sitting out in front of them, they're in a, they're in a static position. The company's in a static position. And there's these, these tanks sitting there, three of them. And Douglas looks at him and he's thinking to himself, hey, I don't know what those, they look like, they're functioning, they don't look damaged. And so Douglas is saying, okay, well we need to find out what's going on.

Speaker 1:          01:23:33       Even if there's no one, even if there's no one in them right now. Or it could be a place where they, you snipers later. Hmm. So someone's got to go check them out. So Sydney, Jerry, the guy, he goes out alone, Kinda sneaks out there. He does stuff alone a little bit more often than it actually does stuff alone. There's another story I didn't mention, but at one point there he hears noise. Look, one of the guys reports it's nighttime and they hear, they hear noise in this field. They think there's an enemy out there and he's white wall. There's one way to find out. So he, I think he does grab another guy in this occasion but it goes out and he's going through this field and it's like a cornfield or something and he can't see any, he's horrified and he can, he's trying to think of a reason to quit.

Speaker 1:          01:24:22       He's like, I just want to go back. This isn't smart. And as he's, as this is taking place in, his fear is climaxing all of a sudden he hears a bunch of cows and it feel good around. So he's doing another solo operation here, trying to find out what these tank like assault guns are doing out there. Back to the book, climbing up above the tracks. I put my head into the Cupola, which was open, a familiar and terrible stench. Hit me inside was a Sharnell house six inches away, a set of bare teeth set in unrecognizable black and incinerated lump grinned at me beside it. A chart and bony arm reached up in agony, spread on the floor like a pool of tar lay. The melted remains of the driver. I had entered Dante's inferno.

Speaker 2:          01:25:25       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:25:25       my head real and with my mouth, nose and lungs filled with the stench of death. I fell back to the ground, although on marked by fire on all on our side, all three assault guns had brewed up and were black and on their sides which faced the enemy.

Speaker 2:          01:25:44       Okay

Speaker 1:          01:25:45       with no stomach to look further. I ran back to the company for getting to look for American minds.

Speaker 2:          01:25:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:25:51       Never again did I look into a knocked out tank or self propelled. Guns are reported a Douglas that nobody in their right mind would use them for an observation post or for any purpose.

Speaker 1:          01:26:06       Later that day he asks, that's Douglas Douglas asked the commander of a Sherman tank to fire some armor piercing shells into each of them positioning his tank hold down. Besides 16 platoons positions which were two are left the tank commanders to take greater first selected the assault gun I had visited his first shell hit. It's slightly above the tracks like the hammer, a Vulcan, a red glow blossomed on the armor plate around the point of entry and slowly faded. It was followed by a second and third shell until a mirage of heat appeared above it and for a second time the funeral pyre blazed with an incandescent ferocity. The Sherman gunner then turned his attention to the next assault gun, which despite being penetrated by about six armor piercing rounds, failed to brew up his first shot at the third, caused a massive internal designation, no doubt due to ammunition stacked within a volcano erupted from its cappola sending a dense cloud of black smoke, smoke and red sparks into the air. A truly Wagnerian and for the warriors and tuned within, but it revolted me for the rest of the day. I booted this communicated itself to my NCS and soldiers who stole mystified glances at my grief for an unknown enemy. During the afternoon, I wandered across the road to a loan house were Dennis Clark had his observation post. I was looking for solace from a wise and good friend. The post was filled with Gunnar officers. There must have been a dozen of them setting up their equipment in preparation for an attack by two one four brigade. This activity precluded any solace for me,

Speaker 1:          01:28:04       immature and undisciplined. My imagination ran riot. What would they like? These men who's already incinerated remains had been blasted into oblivion by the 75 millimeter shells of our friend in the Sherman. My attitude door was ambivalent. Undoubtedly I was parked pacifist, but despite an abysmal record in mathematics and particularly in geometry, I was moderately logical for my age. This clearly ruled out total dedication to pacifism. I had previously discussed the concept of conscientious objection with clergy of all denominations, but none of them could give me constructive answers to my questions. The privations and suffering of 18 platoon hurt me an saw Baltar

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       and he's faced with a conflict which cannot be resolved.

Speaker 1:          01:29:08       One gets emotionally involved with those under one's command. Without this bond, few men will respond and consequently little can be achieved. However, to win battles, decisions have to be taken and orders given which at times may seem to be a betrayal of this trust. Before battle, the commander must exude confidence and enthusiasm. Whatever fears his private thoughts may hold. Just how thin aligned divides this from deliberate deception. I call it the commander's dilemma, a pretentious phrase, but there is nothing to be done about it. In Nicholas Montserrat's book, the Cruel Sea Poor Commander Eric Hansen makes the point with poignancy.

Speaker 2:          01:30:10       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:30:11       it's the war, the whole bloody war. We've just got to do these things and say our prayers. At the end there was another side possibly caused by adrenaline, danger, attracted and excited me. I felt elated and until the battle was over, I was impervious to exhaustion. Commanding a platoon, embattled demands not only a clear mind, but also considerable emotional force. I suspect it is the same transmitted force that exists between a conductor and orchestra. 40 years later, the dilemma of my ambivalence is still unresolved. I find the suffering inflicted by war, unacceptable, particularly amongst women, children and animals. Thank God I was spared the horrific sites. It filets on some days I am a pacifist and yet I'm still attracted by the sounds of guns and but for an extraordinarily happy marriage would have found it difficult to resist the lure of soldiering. So what he calls the commanders dilemma, and this what I call the dichotomy of leadership. And that one is the premier of the mall. And that is as a leader, as a combat leader, there you are going love your man and care about them more than anything else in the world. And with that,

Speaker 2:          01:32:11       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:32:12       you are going to make decisions and make plans where you are sending those men into a situation to where they can be wounded or killed. And that's it. And that is the ultimate dichotomy of leadership. That is the hardest one to balance back to the book, a new officer arrived named Humphreys. He used to play cricket for worst usher. He came on the same day that sergeant Oxland received a well earned commission in the field.

Speaker 2:          01:32:57       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:32:57       Douglass told them about sergeant Oxland and with great consideration he went to 17 platoons position to offer as congratulations.

Speaker 2:          01:33:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:33:07       While they talked just one salvo of one oh five straddled them, one shell fell into second lieutenant Auckland's slit trench and both were killed instantly. Like me, Ken Oxen has survived five months, Humphrey survived, not a full day. Is there a mathematical formula by which survival can be calculated? Who are the survivors and can they be recognized over the past 40 years? I've often pondered this, but still offer no real answer.

Speaker 2:          01:33:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:33:50       I suspect, however, that is something to do with attitude. The attitude seems to me to be a parameter which restricts not only our relationships, but also our creative effort. Further comment is unwise. Humphreys, one could argue had little time to develop an attitude to our kind of existence. Undoubtedly a self fulfilling circle develops newcomers inexperienced in the perils of the battlefield, suffered the highest casualties, knowledge of what can and what cannot be. Wrist postpones the fatal recognizing for the soldier.

Speaker 2:          01:34:33       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:34:34       for the commander. However, Jr battlefield experience will not only protect himself, but also all those under his command.

Speaker 2:          01:34:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:34:46       And that's the, that's why training is so important. So important. And that's why when I got done with, you know, deployment to Ramadi, it's why went to training? Because I knew that right there and I was thinking, you know, I didn't know how long the water was going to ask him when we left Ramadi. Ramadi was still horrible.

Speaker 4:          01:35:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:35:08       And when the task unit came in, relieved us, man, they were getting after it and I didn't know how long that was gonna last. I mean, it ended up not lasting that much longer, that kind of intense fighting, but it was impossible to tell at that time. We were just barely seeing stuff start to get started to get better at the end of our deployment, just barely starting to see the first indications of that back to the book.

Speaker 4:          01:35:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:35:41       The fifth Duke of Cornwall is Light Infantry at attempted to attack Hoven village through these ghastly woods and had taken heavy casualties there. Rain soaked bodies littered the paths and clearings while carrying out a reconnaissance. I came across one of their sections lying across, lying along a small path facing the enemy.

Speaker 4:          01:36:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:36:04       At first, I fought them alive until I saw that the studs on their boots were rusty and their webbing equipment was bleached with rain. Their battle dress was starched with mud and their hands and faces were green. German booby traps were on or near many of the tracks, and I was told by the company commander of the fourth wheelchairs from whom we took over the position that some of the bodies were also booby trapped. Don't try to bury them. He said I was temporarily commanding the company because Douglas had been given a well deserved leave and Brussels, although militarily, comparatively uneventful, Hoven has a special place in my memories. It was without a doubt my most, the most grisly and horrifying position that we ever hold held. But more importantly, it was the place of private Charles Ravens triumph. Raven had fought in all our battles since hill one 12 which to him was a yard stick of horror. All subsequent experience was compared with that. His first battle, he was no soldier. I doubt if he influenced greatly any of the skirmishes and counters or battles in which he took part. Sometimes he was frightened and he was so out of place on the battlefield that I often wondered how he became an infantry soldier

Speaker 1:          01:37:34       before the war. He had been a clerk in north London. I'm sure he was a conscientious and loyal employee and a considerate and loving husband for unlike most of us. He was married.

Speaker 4:          01:37:48       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:37:49       Raven had hidden depths and could be inspired once a Normandy during a nasty little platoon attack up a sunken lane. 18 platoon was held up by the inevitable unlocated spanned dose straining my eyes through binoculars. I was trying vainly to locate these guns when I was handed a steaming mug of tea.

Speaker 4:          01:38:12       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:38:13       he should've been observing to his front, but judging the moment, right, he had brewed a mess tin of tea on a solid fuel stove by any standards. This wasn't inspired act. He was considerate with our reinforcements. Pale on sure men, some of whom until recently it served in the royal artillery and had been transferred to infantry regiments to replace the appalling losses incurred in the Norman depot cottage. Beside them, raven looked bronzed and weather beaten. A hardened campaigner complete with a German Luger pistol to prove it. Some of the platoon regaled the reinforcements with horrible tales from Normandy and elsed as little more than a school boy. I found these stories and music raven did not. Fear for him was horribly real and never to be joked about. He developed a paternal attitude toward the newer and younger soldiers, a relationship devoid of patronage, but essentially one of kindly understanding. He spoke to me about it when the, I thanked him for his help. I admit I'm dead windy sir. His extraordinary honesty with himself from the rest of the platoon forbade him to attempt to hide the fact raven and overtaxed as nervous and physical resources long before we arrived in Hoven woods.

Speaker 4:          01:39:49       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:39:50       After two days in the position, he came to me late one evening and asked my permission to report sick the following morning. I suppose I should and physically have refused, but something made me hesitate and avoid dealing directly with the situation. I said simply, all right, raven, but do come see me before you leave. He didn't come. The matter was never again mentioned. I can only surmise the struggle which raged in his mind all that night while he crouched in his water log, slit trench, peering into the sinister darkness of the wood. I do know, however, that in Hoven would a considerable moral triumph over stark horror was achieved by a good man, unequipped equipped for nature on a cooked by nature for war in my view, the bravest of the brave. So that guy rave and had been through all this stuff and just barely held the line. And finally he was going to break. Finally he was going to break and he, and he comes to city Jerry and says, Hey, I'm, I'm good to go sick tomorrow, Cindy. Jerry says, okay, come and see me before you go. He doesn't come back. It doesn't come back to him, doesn't go sick.

Speaker 4:          01:41:15       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:41:19       back to the book. Infantry warfare is wretched business. It makes physical and emotional demands on participants that run contrary to all human instinct. The strong minority must quietly help the weak majority. To me, that is the essence of good teamwork. And that jewel in the crown of the British army, the regimental system is the strong foundation upon which we all knowingly or unknowingly relied. So there's gonna be some people that deal with it better than others and you've got to help them. Here's the situation.

Speaker 1:          01:42:07       They set up early warning flares, so we'll trip wires in case due to to notify them if the enemy's moving down one of their flanks. And here we go back to the book. After about 10 minutes had passed, we heard the popping of mortars behind Hoven village and a concentration of bombs fell in the fields where we had laid the flares suddenly are left flank, was vividly illuminated as flare after flare ignited. Knowing little about these flares, we had laid them with the trip wires to talk. How do we allow to degree of slack? The flares would not have ignited my fault. I should have known, had to throw a little extreme ownership from Sydney, Jerry and therefore y'all sure. Now he's talking about the attitudes of the soldiers and how soldiers, you know, there was a claim, he read an article years after the war that said that people, you know, people became brutal from the, from the war.

Speaker 1:          01:43:13       And here's what he says back to the book does a war brutalize one can only speak from personal experience, but I think not. Certainly no soldier of mine was made brutal. Rather the opposite war developed an 18 platoon consideration for comrades and humanity towards civilians and prisoners of war. I was proud of my soldiers then and this sentiment has increased with the passing of years. I would not suggest that the naturally brutal might not find in Warren outlet for their brutality. However, that ward is not brutalize the type of decent men, the type of decent and fair minded young English men whom I had the very great honor to command. We were not an aggressive generation of fact, which may explain my failure to understand some present day attitudes and the armed services, particularly in the Royal Marines and the parachute regimen.

Speaker 4:          01:44:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:44:12       Possibly a degree of personal aggression is appropriate and troops are come who are committed to battle for comparatively short periods like the marines and the Paris when the success of an operation depends on ultra rapid action. However, in my experience, troops lose personal aggression. After about two months in battle, after three months, they acquire a mature compassion, which in no way detracts from their authentic of capability. They simply know a lot more about war.

Speaker 4:          01:44:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:44:47       I would suggest that personal aggression should not be confused with authentic of spirit based on professional competence and experience. Interesting. Take that aggression that you can maintain if you, it's not going to last forever and, and then you're going to have to fall back on duty and, and that mature compassion, which isn't taken away from their offensive capability.

Speaker 4:          01:45:29       Interesting.

Speaker 1:          01:45:36       Back to the book on the 11th of January, we returned to the south. Fine. Yeah. Just to go back to that one piece right there. Dichotomy, leadership. There's a dichotomy and everything and uh, you know, obviously I'm a big proponent of being aggressive and I also always talk about the fact that there is such a thing as being too aggressive. You're running to your death. No, not a good idea. Not a good idea. And there's probably a good chance that when he talks about people after two months of combat, everyone starts to develop a different type of attitude. Also, the people that were ultra aggressive didn't make it like the, like the leader that he talked about that was strutting around the guy was ultra aggressive, didn't care about anything, and he's dead. Yeah, so there's a balance you got to have. That's the dichotomy of leadership. That's why the dichotomy of leadership is so important and so hard to understand. Back to the book, on the day after the battalion was relieved in Hoeven Woods, someone I suspect, I suspect it was the adjutant, Tim Watson decided that I should enjoy 48 hours on leave in Antwerp. I was overjoyed. The large hotel,

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       although faded, we're still plush and filled with officers, including women, ATS officers from the various base unit stationed in the city dressed as I left the battlefield. I was both disheveled and soiled, surrounded by the residents, many of whom were in service dress. I could not have felt more isolated and lonely. So he's getting some leave time, but he's showing up off the battlefield. Grimy. My first visit was to a magnificent white marble gentleman's hairdressing salon in the basement of a hotel.

Speaker 2:          01:47:24       Okay?

Speaker 3:          01:47:25       Without a word. The Barbara washed and rinsed my hair twice before touching it with his precious scissors and clippers. I remember the feeling of wellbeing as climbing the stairs. I returned to my room next, I took three very hot baths, one after the other to rid myself of grime, both physical and emotional. I think I must have slept for 14 hours before I rose shaved, took another bath and decided to explore the city. Uh, rather creased battle dress was my best suit. And in this I descended the main staircase into the lounge, which was filled with the resident officers, all of whom seem to be annoyingly self assured. I met a barrier. Okay. I had walked out of a world that I knew into one where I was desperately unsure of myself away from the battlefield. This world, I had no place for me. I did not go out to lunch, go to nightclubs, or meet the girls who were everywhere seem to be canvassing for these establishments. I had wandered too far into dark and smokey battlefields across the sticks to find solace or comfort in the bright lights behind the blackout curtains of Antwerp.

Speaker 3:          01:48:57       I longed to return to the battalion and to 18 platoon, which without my knowing it

Speaker 2:          01:49:04       okay

Speaker 3:          01:49:04       had become my home with a light heart, a clean body, flesh, freshly laundered clothes and refreshed by hours of unbroken sleep. I gladly climbed into the three ton truck that took me there years later. I found the same problem after I left the army. Antwerp had been a small taste of the real world and as anyone who has served with good soldiers on grim battlefields, we'll confirm afterwards. Real life never seems real again. Later. There was no 18 platoon to slink back to.

Speaker 2:          01:49:47       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:49:47       And without a

Speaker 2:          01:49:47       will loving wife, it would have proved in tolerable.

Speaker 3:          01:49:56       Well, that's the feeling that that we get.

Speaker 2:          01:50:02       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:50:03       When you get done doing that job.

Speaker 2:          01:50:07       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:50:08       And real life. Never seen. He was real again in comparison. I know the vets that are listening to understand that part. Back to the book on 11 January, we returned to the south of Holland. This time to gang gang lit snow lay on deeply frozen ground and life for the intro and life for the infantry. Manning their slit trenches became unbearable again. The Battalion Front was extensive. D Company was in reserve, closed close to battalion headquarters on the edge of town. Fortunately gang out was on a reverse slope which allowed us to move freely during daylight hours. The cold was penetrating. The oil in our automatic weapons froze and until antifreeze lubricants were issued, our brands were useless. Holding a wide front with large gaps between our company positions necessitated putting out many standing patrols, particularly at night. The privation suffered by these small patrols. Usually a corporal and three or four men were harder than the rest of us. Some had hallucinations and if you were exact a evacuated suffering from exposure, keeping fit, warm and clean became a great effort. Conversation dried up. The platoon became quiet but never morose. At one stage. I decided they needed cheering up and I wandered around the section post ready to chat with all of them.

Speaker 3:          01:51:46       It was quite unnecessary. I had wrongly judged their mood. They just wanted to be left alone. Now there's a, again by the book and read the book. There's a chaotic bottle battle at a pace place called Cleve and after the battle of cleave, he kind of debriefs here back to the book. What instructors at the school of infantry would think about the fighting Cleve. I shutter to think it resembled no other battle. In my experience. I have little control and it developed into a section commanders battle. Looking back over the years, it seems military leave totally unprofessional, are real wild west shootout.

Speaker 3:          01:52:34       Tactically, the Germans had every advantage. We were strung out in a long column, a mid shattered buildings and piles of rebels with the groups of parachute troops attacking both sides. They could snipe at us and engage with our, with their spanned owls from dozens of physicians, totally hidden by piles of rubble. They had the opportunity to concentrate their counter attacks on the narrowest of fronts but failed to do to do so, so they failed to focus their efforts. I can only assume that we had the psychological advantage, the circumstances being so chaotic and disorganized, perhaps being Germans, they cannot overcome their instinct for organization and tidiness. In the end, they departed possibly and discussed leaving us undisputed victors

Speaker 3:          01:53:33       on another attack. The Germans at this point are retreating and they can see that they're retreating. Fearing that the retreating parachute troops would make a stand on the edge of the wood. I increased the rate of advance joining Lance Corporal Porteous in the forward section running across the level crossing, I suddenly found myself face to face with a German platoon complete with the MG 34 fortunately, the gun was mounted on a tripod which was unusual and could not be traversed in our direction from a drainage channel. On the left of the road, a parachute has leaped up. Swathed and Camouflage Vale pointing is Schweizer at me from about 10 yards range. He fired a whole magazine of about 30 rounds. It was like watching a slow running silent movie. I didn't hear the chatter of the [inaudible], but I do remember seeing this stream of empty cartridges. Cartridge cases fly from the German machine.

Speaker 3:          01:54:30       Gun Miracles do indeed happen. One nine millimeter bullet went through my baret, missing my head literally by a hair's width. Another went under the Epilep of my jacket, penetrating the webbing or cross brace. The webbing cross brace of my equipment in grazing. My right shoulder, a third bullet ricocheted off the surface of the road and disintegrated the jacket. Finally, lodging in the palm of my right hand. Then came the anticlimax. The German looked at me in amazement through way as sir and I with a shrug of the shoulders. He surrendered. My natural elation was short lived behind me. Lay Lance corporal Porteous shot through the heart. Some of the German platoon ran away across the open fields to our left and were cut down by rapid fire. Bren gun by Sergeant Kingston Section, which now wind the railway track to the left of the road. The remainder of the enemy came towards us over the level crossing with their hands raised. We took 57 prisoners.

Speaker 2:          01:55:49       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:55:49       Now they're moving along and they are clearing some cottages and they get to this one cottage filled with rough wooden bunks. It it obviously served as an air raid shelter. The house having been found clear of enemy. Jack Lee was off his guard as he descended the steps suddenly from under a pile of blankets lept the fanatical German paratrooper. The only fanatical German paratrooper we encountered the entire battle. A large man, he sees Jack around the throat in an attempt to strangle him. Private fluid rose to the challenge in a bound. He was down the steps and with a mighty lunge transfixed the German on his band net, a brave lad. He undoubtedly saved Lance Corporal Lee's life just eight days before losing his own. The German was indeed unlucky as it was the only occasion throughout the campaign on which 18 paltunes bayonets were bloodied. We usually use them to open food cans, having checked the platoon positions and arcs of fire for the brands. Exhaustion hit me.

Speaker 2:          01:56:54       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:56:55       I fell into a deep sleep during the evening. A senior officer, I understand it was either to brigade or divisional commander, came out to my company position when he asked to speak to me. Sergeant Kingston refuse to have me wakened. I'm sure that Jim was the most diplomatic about it, but it says much for our visitors, humanity that he let it go by another attack. A and c companies were unleashed and passing be company, secure their objectives against some opposition. There was now our turn d company advanced across the flat open fields down the left hand side

Speaker 3:          01:57:42       of the main road into Zam 10 it's the name of the city or village casualties from the preceding companies in the opposition lay all around about 300 yards short of the town were extremely accurately engaged by a battery of one oh five s some of their shells exploded on the hard surface. The road earsplitting detonations and frightening fragmentation pieces of shell casing hummed in wind around us. One twirling piece in bedded itself with a thud into the trunk of a tree a few inches from my right ear was the only time in the whole campaign when I regretted throwing away my steel helmet. I think it was the accuracy and the intense noise of the showing that caused it. One of 18 platoons, lance corporals, a big man who had served honorably since market garden went to pieces. There was a pathetic sight and to everyone's credit, he was removed from the battle. He had passed his limit and nothing more can be said, so you don't know. These guys are brave at one moment and then a week, a month, two months, four months. They can't do it anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:59:04       Okay?

Speaker 3:          01:59:05       They get across the Rhine. Now they're fully in Germany. There's a little bit of a lull in the fighting back to the book. Early one morning while we were waiting for our supporting armor to arrive, our pod Dre, John Williams drove a receipt us after wandering around the platoon for a chat. He suggested he suggested that we should go for a short stroll. I had now been commanding 18 platoon for over eight months and I suspect that our adjutant Tim Watson, a kindly soul, had asked him to find out what shape I was in. We had not gone far into the next field when he came across some grizzly remnants. One of our artillery shells must have exploded right at the feet of a German soldier who had been digging. A slit. Trench is splintered and twisted. Spade lay beside laid by the side of that half dug trench beside which was a small shell hole. He had been disintegrated into small pieces of flesh and bone, which lay scattered all over the field. Had I been on my own, I would no doubt have shuttered and quickly departed from this horror draped over a wire fence nearby. Lay a parachute, which are extraordinarily brave. Padre spread out as a shroud on the cold and damp grass.

Speaker 3:          02:00:31       Then stooping. He walked around the field, a lonely figure reverently picking up every piece of that poor soldier. To my shame, I stood and watched him. I lack the courage to help somewhere beneath those flat damp fields just north of the Ryan. That pallette it. Pathetic Bundle. Must still lie. Now they're an attack again, but it seems like things are going their way and we're going, he's, he's kind of giving a brief to his, to his runner. When all of a sudden he hears yelling back to the books or they're charging us. Sure enough, from about 150 yards ahead of wealth spread outline of about 20 Germans were putting in a bayonet charge. Brave lads,

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       they didn't stand a chance. Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:01:43       I gave no orders except ceasefire, not one God within 75 yards of us, a few minutes later, a possession of Germans with stretchers and a huge red flag emerged from the village behind.

Speaker 2:          02:02:00       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:02:01       When they were close to their casualties, they hesitated. So I stood up and waved them on, all wore on arms stretcher bearers, and they moved across our front collecting their dead and wounded when they had finished their task of mercy. One of them, I think he must have been a German medical officer turned and saluted in our direction.

Speaker 2:          02:02:22       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:02:23       I returned the salute and with that gesture, the tiny battle of Cinderella ended.

Speaker 2:          02:02:31       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:02:32       In Bremen, little over a month later, one of our stretcher bearers, Lance Corporal Jay Stevens, was killed by a German grenade as he went to tend to wounded German soldier. 18 platoon remembering syndrome were justifiably outraged by such on soldierly behavior.

Speaker 2:          02:02:55       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:03:00       There is a mathematical formula. Aggression increases. The further one goes behind the lines. Opposing infantry with few exceptions like the SS are joined by a natural bond of mutual compassion, which few but the aristocracy of the battlefield can understand the public influence, no doubt by writers with literally no experience of battle have strange and sometimes silly ideas about what makes a good soldier. Ill informed television programs have added to this misunderstanding. Few professions can be have been so misleadingly caricature.

Speaker 2:          02:03:39       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:03:39       I had, I been asked at the time before August, 1944 to list the personal characteristics which go to make a good infantry soldier. My reply would indeed have been wider than mark wide of the mark. Like most I no doubt would have suggested only masculine ones like aggression, physical stamina. A hunting instinct instinct and competitive nature.

Speaker 2:          02:04:01       Okay,

Speaker 3:          02:04:02       how wrong I would have been, I would now suggest the following, firstly, sufferance without which one could not survive. So he's listing what he thinks the most important characteristics for for an infantry soldier are. The first one is sufferance, the ability to suffer. Secondly, a quiet mind which enables a soldier to live in harmony with his fellows through all sorts of difficulties and sometimes under dreadful conditions. As in a closed monastic existence, there is simply no

Speaker 1:          02:04:37       room for the assertive or acrimonious. Thirdly, below, no less important. A sense of the ridiculous which helps us soldiers surmount the unacceptable add to these are reasonable standard of physical fitness and a dedicated professional competence. And you have a soldier for all seasons. None of the soldiers are ntls who made 18 platoon. What it was resembled the characters portrayed in most books and films about war. All quiet, sensible on assuming and some by any standard. We're heroes. If I now had to select a team for a dangerous mission and my choice was restricted to stars of the sports field or poets, I would own hesitatingly recruit from the ladder. Very interesting. And I mean, obviously you have to put this in the context of, of his time, but

Speaker 2:          02:05:54       okay.

Speaker 1:          02:05:55       There's no doubt that, I mean, you get a sports star, especially these days, those guys that are getting paid 2030 $40 million a year to play a game, they're, they're probably not going to be the best at suffering in a trench.

Speaker 2:          02:06:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:06:16       Interesting. And I, and I think the key point of that is what is, going back to what he talks about earlier, is he someone that can think, hmm. Someone that can think someone that is not trapped in, in thinking the same thoughts as everyone else, which certainly an artist or a poet has to be outside the box of normal fought. Otherwise they become, they don't become that. Right.

Speaker 2:          02:06:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:06:52       In this situation. His platoon is kind of pin down and there's an air raid shelter, which has someone in it is firing these things called a panzer Faust, which is like a, it's kind of like a bazooka or like an RPG looking thing and he sees where it's coming from and he sees that it's this shelter. Yeah, but he doesn't know who's in the shelter. Here we go back to the COO. Who else was in the shelter? Women and children's sheltering more enemy soldiers with more pounds or Faust and spanned o's. We were in a vulnerable situation and it was no good pushing forward and ignoring the Metis lurking inside that shelter. I could have

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       sent two or three men to clear it. However, experience it taught me that when clearing sellers that the first man sent in is invariably killed.

Speaker 2:          02:07:46       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:07:46       Instead, concentrated fire was poured into the entrance, included get pee out, bomb.

Speaker 2:          02:07:53       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:07:53       Around us. The battle still raged and no opportunity arose for Medians for me to inspect the consequences of an awful decision.

Speaker 3:          02:08:04       Nevertheless, my duty was to win battles and not to gamble with the lives of my soldiers by fussing over too sensitive a conscience. So there you go. There's a dichotomy for you. If the one hand he's looking at the shelter thinking there might be women and kids in there, but at this moment in time he doesn't have time to find out and doesn't have time to, to take the most cautious route. So they hammer it with machine gun fire and some some anti tank rounds. He never even goes to look. Hmm. But he knows that he can't, his duty is to win battles and he can't dilly dally because he has a sensitive conscious doesn't work. Back to the book. Bremerhaven was our final objective.

Speaker 2:          02:08:51       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:08:52       It was 5th of May, 1945 19 days before my 21st birthday. Thinking about what you were doing, you were twins. That's why it's so interesting. Ready to break out.

Speaker 2:          02:09:07       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:09:07       We were concentrated at, we'll stat about 20 miles north of Bremen when the end came, and by the end, I mean the end of the war, 129 brigades order was stand down and splice. The main brace, which is a military, is actually a navy term splice. The main brace me, it's like drinking light is lit. You can drink the war's over. I had just given orders for our small part in the Brigades move forward against 15 panzer division, one of the famous Africa core formations.

Speaker 2:          02:09:43       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:09:44       In 1983 Jim Kingston gave me his copy of those orders, which he had kept all those years reaction to the end of the war, like aggression increased further behind the lines. One went,

Speaker 2:          02:10:00       okay.

Speaker 3:          02:10:00       The natural aristocracy of the battlefield, the infantry having fired a photo, joy, a very lights curled up and slept. We had learned too much to indulge in shallow demonstrations, so everyone's all fireworks and getting crazy. These guys are like, cool, I'm going to sleep. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:10:22       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:10:22       Since July, we had come a long way from the Normandy beach head.

Speaker 2:          02:10:26       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:10:27       The battalion had lost 47 officers and 1,260 and [inaudible] and private soldiers killed or wounded after July 31st, 1944 no member of 18 platoon was put on a charge. No one went absent or deserted.

Speaker 2:          02:10:48       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:10:49       Of the original 36 NCRS and soldiers who had landed in Normandy, only corporal Cheesman remained, or one man, many came after them and lasted a few days, weeks or months. Phew. I was able to thank adequately, I doubt if any of them realized how much I personally owed 18 platoon.

Speaker 2:          02:11:16       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:11:17       When I joined them on 31st of July, I was naive and Gosh, due to a narrow upbringing except for a passionate love of music, my intellect and emotions were unstimulated. My achievement at school had been abysmal. My mind was undisciplined and confidence in myself. Nil. This was rapidly swept away probably within three weeks, certainly before we crossed the CN on the 28th of August, discovering an ability to command a group of men, some frightened and but wilderness produced a new found confidence, particularly since I seem to be able to achieve it quietly and without acrimony or foss, having to improvise tactics to overcome the shortcomings of battle school training also helped. It proved to me that in some circumstances, older and more experienced deny others older and more experienced than I could be wrong. I suspect that as an only child, I had been brought up in too much off my elders.

Speaker 2:          02:12:28       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:12:29       a new world. It opened before me. Forethought and planning were demanded. Imagination and instinct too. Was that apparently quiet Normandy lane lethal, the intense Spandau fire and mortaring along a dyke. Was it a prelude to an enemy's withdrawal? Did the orchard in front of the village hide 88

Speaker 2:          02:12:53       okay.

Speaker 3:          02:12:53       My judgment and these things had proved equal to better than most of them the most, and it was the making of me. It also brought a few problems. I'm now only able to plan and run things in my way. As a result, I'm probably unemployable.

Speaker 2:          02:13:12       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:13:13       However, I would never wish to change places with the shy, hesitant boy whom circumstances put in command of 18 we'll tune age 20 I was far too young and inexperienced to appreciate that an infantry platoon was the finest command in the army and that's the success or failure of a so often lay solely in the hands of a young officer.

Speaker 2:          02:13:36       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:13:37       After careful reflection, I doubt that at any time since the war have I carried the burden of responsibility that I bore has a softball turn in battle. Wait, an army core division or brigade was committed to battle. It was the battalion company and platoon commanders who took over the mantle of responsibility from the generals from the generals and brigadiers.

Speaker 2:          02:14:03       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:14:03       And close country forests and street fighting. The platoon commander became the linchpin.

Speaker 2:          02:14:10       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:14:11       Only the company at platoon commanders, particularly the ladder, we're able to have close relationship with their soldiers, which is a prerequisite for having above average success failure by one infantry company. Correct. A divisional battle plan.

Speaker 2:          02:14:28       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:14:28       Conversely gallant success, like be company at Zahn 10 underwrote the battalion's victory. Again, I would emphasize the analog with the bond of professional respect between a great conductor and the members of a symphony orchestra without which a truly great performance is not possible. Outstanding performances cannot be arranged in a concert promoters office. They're created by some magic by the conductor and players and rehearsal and performance. Similarly, while senior commanders appreciated the strengths and weaknesses of their battalions and brigades, they could not extract a great performance from the rifleman upon whom victory dependent only the company or platoon commanders supported by their NC o's could ensure that 42 years on, I get considerable satisfaction from 18 platoon successes more so than I got at the time. So those were his thoughts in it. And he's the wars now over

Speaker 2:          02:15:44       and

Speaker 3:          02:15:47       a few days after the war ended. Um, well go to the book after cholera inoculations, we were conducted into the world of Frankenstein.

Speaker 2:          02:16:00       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:16:00       Nothing had prepared us for what we now experienced, not hill one 12, not mount pin shown elsewhere or Hoven could compete with this horror before the incredulous eyes. If 18 platoon spread over acres of delightfully wooded countryside was a factory of death, emaciated bodies resembling wax effigies of an alien race from a strange and distant planet

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       filled many pits. The stench of death and the site of such highly industrialized human degradation left my soldiers speechless. Private Macy d companies jeep driver aptly summed it up. There is now no doubt that we have fought a just war. That's after they saw the concentration camps. Obviously back to the book. Within a month of the war ending 21st army group was required to supply junior officers for the 14th army in Burma. Lippi the commanding officer decided that I should be one of them. And by then being intent on a military career, I was not inclined to argue. I would gain useful experience of jungle warfare, of which I knew nothing about. So they're getting orders still a war going on in the Pacific. Oh, you wrapped up portion from Normandy through Germany. Through their surrender. Guess, well, we need, we need people to go to fight in Asia. We need people in Burma. I was totally unprepared for the platoons, for the emotions that were unleashed immediately after I was deprived of 18 platoon, has a jeep, took me away from the battalion, a ghastly desolation and Gulf to me, I felt like a small boy on his way to a grim and unknown boarding school.

Speaker 1:          02:18:24       The pleasures of commanding 18 platoon in peace time or being denied me.

Speaker 2:          02:18:34       And

Speaker 1:          02:18:37       it's interesting. So he's gets pulled away from his platoon and, and he goes into talk about what happened to the guys that survived, that he knew. And I, I found this part to be fascinating in the how these people went back to normal life. Back to the book, Jim Kingston was demobilized in January, 1946 and two months later he returned to his civilian post with the Bristol Corporation, Electricity Department, retired in 1975 never married Doug proctor, return home to his wife and baby son and Nottingham. And March of 1946 found the transition from army to civilian life, painless. Returning to his accounting post in the coal.

Speaker 3:          02:19:31       Oh, in Cheesman. During the first few days of his demobilization, his wife died miserable. And for Lauren, he returned to his old job in Covent garden. And a few years later he met and married Bella, who in his own words, was a comfort and inspiration to him. Charles Raven joined the London transport as a bus conductor later transferring to the clerical staff and rose by hard work and study to be a garage inspector. Joe Thomas and George Harish went into the building trade industry in Bridgewater. Surprisingly, just incredibly normal paths after this incredibly not normal life. And, and what happened to Sidney Jerry? So here's what happened to Sidney. Jerry, back to the book, arriving in England on 9th of July, 1945 I reported to the Holding Battalion of the Hampshire Regiment at Westgate on C and was immediately sent on 28 days leave after a night out in London with three friends, also Burma bound. I telephoned my parents and found them away chopping them to Bognor Regis. I caught a train from Waterloo and went to see them staying at the same hotel as my parents were flight Lieutenant Jack weatherleys widow. Peggy and their three year old daughter and we're staying at the same hotel as his parents at once. A bond of deep understanding and affection developed between us.

Speaker 3:          02:21:25       In August, an atom bomb was dropped and so at a stroke my visit to Burma was rendered pointless. So two in my heart was a military career. I soldiered on in Libya and Palestine with the first battalion of my own regimen for two more interesting years and finally was demobilized in May of 1947 within a week of leaving the army, I attended a job interview. The managing director who saw me, a pale and thin lipped man was a business acquaintance of a relative. He, I'd meet coldly slowly and precisely from his desk. He lifted a ruler, which he rudely pointed at my face. I understand that you made a slight name for yourself from the war. Be that as it may people like you. Jerry should remember that while you have been gallivanting around the world, most of my staff had remained loyalty to come to the company. If you can give me one valid reason why should even consider you for any position, I should be interested to hear it. I nearly hit him now. I wish that I had quickly grabbing my hat and umbrella. I rose and told him that if he was the last man in the world, I would rather starve than work for him. With that I left my heart pounding and a foul taste in my mouth. I walked aimlessly through miles of streets wishing that I was back on some battlefield with real men.

Speaker 3:          02:23:11       Soldiers like 18 platoon armistice day brings its problems. Peg and I would like to go to church. We used to go but found almost without exception a lack of perception and sensitivity amongst the clergy. We suffered one armistice day cert sermon devoted to the cure rates theory that war being a crime against humanity. All Chivalry must there for be hypocritical. I wondered whether the German stretcher bearers and they're wounded at Syndrom would have agreed. I took offense pag and I have a lot to mourn. She, Jack Weatherly and I, 18 platoons dead. Perhaps it is expecting too much of anyone to understand intense grief, particularly that of a now aging platoon commander who had to lead some of his men to their deaths. We now spend arm assist day quietly

Speaker 2:          02:24:26       at home

Speaker 3:          02:24:29       with our ghosts. Memories abound during the night. I made a habit of wandering around the platoon positioned so that each of my soldiers could talk to me. I learned a lot. They talked about their families and their future hopes. I hardly had to contribute to those whispered conversations that some times took place in the dead of night or in the cold gray light just before dawn. I think it may have helped my soldiers to have a confidant, invaluable experience of human nature. I now treasure the memory weapons. Also left memories, the monotonous, repetitive bursts of the Brin, the hysterical of the MG 42 for furious rate of fire and the lethal chatter of the stands and schmeissers all contribute, all contributed to the cacophony of battle tracer. Bullets seared themselves into memory. Fired from a distance.

Speaker 2:          02:25:44       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:25:44       the parrot, the parrot. Bola approached almost laser Lee until suddenly like a swarm of fiery demons. They accelerated directly past one's head with earsplitting cracks. I shall never forget the brain splitting shockwave is mortar bombs detonated northern rending of the atmosphere when a stick of Nebo War for bomb straddled one slit trench, my memory is stocked with smells, the metallic stench of dead cattle and Normandy. The pungent odor of German prisoners and the vial penetrating chemical smell from a newly proud shell crater. Strange fleeting memories too.

Speaker 2:          02:26:33       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:26:34       Why in circumstance of great danger did the palms of my hands moistened making it difficult to grip the butt of my pistol. Why on Pitch Black Knights full of menace? Was it possible to discern enemy movement by fixing my straining eyes slightly to its side? It sounds foolish, but I swear that it works. After 40 years, I am sure I could still prime a 36 grenade in total darkness or load the magazines of a cult automatic pistol. I remember our dead

Speaker 2:          02:27:13       okay.

Speaker 3:          02:27:14       Their souls departing, they lay awkwardly like bundles of discarded clothing.

Speaker 2:          02:27:20       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:27:21       At bed. Berg, lance corporal Porteous laid by their railway crossing in an instant. He had gone leaving his body clothing and equipment

Speaker 2:          02:27:33       empty

Speaker 3:          02:27:36       at Helvin. Boom, private Jones died with a tiny cry Boston, the chill winter air as the bullet took him from us. Memories are not all sad. Rarely since as my adrenaline flowed as an invents to combat with all the senses. Alert one lived for a few hours, sometimes for day at a concert pitch like a drug. It captivated me. I wanted more totally absorbed, one pressed on until objectives had been seized and I flopped as I had never done since. I remember the mood of pulsating expectancy during the last few hours before battle. Old trusted friends like Dennis Clark and Brantley Hancock would arrive to tie up their artillery support. Others troop commanders from the Sherwood Rangers would appear almost in party mood to marry up with us. Very air was a vibrant with excitement and good fellowship, no acrimony, simply an exercise and willing cooperation to help us. The infantry overcome the days grim task. But my most treasured memory is the simple and sincere affection which existed between us all based on mutual trust. It was the cornerstone of the platoons success and it survives unchanged. To this day. This is tinge to with regret, regret because Jim Kingston, Owen Cheeseman, and particularly Doug proctor, did not receive any recognition they so richly deserved.

Speaker 3:          02:29:36       Jim and Owen were mentioned in dispatches, but Doug was left on rewarded. Over the years. This omission has troubled me, particularly because I had not been so had I not been so young and inexperienced, more notice might have been taken of my representations. I have no doubt that they all learned a military metal on more than one occasion and I, their platoon commander failed them. In this respect, I miss my soldiers. The warmth of their presence comforted me and their humor restored my spirits in the brutal world. If infantry warfare, although few of them realized it and certainly none would admit it, their behavior was noble. Their absence left a void, which, but for an exceptionally happy marriage would have certainly drawn me back into the army for the comfort that only a soldier can understand. Strangely, I have never since considered myself anything but

Speaker 2:          02:30:57       a soldier.

Speaker 3:          02:31:10       And that wraps up that book.

Speaker 1:          02:31:23       And I'm not sure if I have much to add because, because Sydney Jerry seems to capture it. And so much of what he talks about explains so much, not only about about being a soldier, but also about what it's like when a soldier is no longer a soldier to, to miss the adrenaline, to miss that singular focus, to miss seeing men at their best, at their noblest, to miss the men themselves, your comrades, your friends, your brothers to miss what he calls so perfectly that simple and sincere affection that exists in a platoon they'd affection that I'm not sure exists anywhere else. And you, you hear me talk about when I start talking about a seal platoon about how that's the best thing in the world. And Sydney, Jerry captures it better than me. You miss the mission and you miss the men. And of course you miss the fallen as the British, call them the glorious dead and you wonder what would have become with them. Where would they be now?

Speaker 3:          02:34:20       And do you wonder why?

Speaker 2:          02:34:27       Why them? Why was it down?

Speaker 3:          02:34:40       And you know, I talk about the gift, right? The gift that they gave us, that the fallen if given us this gift of freedom and this gift of life. But there's, there's more,

Speaker 2:          02:35:04       there's more

Speaker 3:          02:35:08       because you see the rest of us, we grow old time passes us by. And that that's simple and sincere affection that Sydney Jerry describes, it changes as we change.

Speaker 2:          02:35:46       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:35:47       It ages as we age, but the fallen do not change but fallen, do not. Age. Time has no effect on them. They remain babe. Remain young and bold and brave and unconquerable. It's so we remember them

Speaker 2:          02:36:34       that way

Speaker 3:          02:36:37       as they were. And as they will always be. Tara heroes. Heroes who walk no more and yet walk everywhere with us.

Speaker 2:          02:37:03       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:37:04       Who smile no more. And yet they never stopped smiling heroes who lived no more yet never stop

Speaker 5:          02:37:16       living car. Friends who shine no more and yet never stopped shining. And that is the other gift that they give us. The fortunate to bask in their lighting. Do don't remember.

Speaker 2:          02:38:21       Okay.

Speaker 5:          02:38:23       I think that's all I've got for tonight. So reco maybe a frog, you can talk about something else for a little while.

Speaker 5:          02:38:56       Yeah, I would appreciate it. Sure. You know, apart that kind of stood out and we talk about this before where there was a part where, you know the Germans, the bandits, they were attacking 150 yards away and they just get mowed down. They just keep killed and then the red flag comes up, stretchers come out, everyone sees fire. It's kind of like, you know, they're following these specific rules. Yeah. And then so they collect the buddies and they salute kind of like, okay, we're, we're good. And then he salutes back. Okay, solid. No game on essentially game on now. But this is like a war though. You know, it's different. I mean you kind of get that same feeling way on a lower level obviously. But like your watch, like a UFC fight and then the round ends and then the guys kind of like bump glove for sure. Good round. Do you know for sure, but two seconds ago you, you guys are trying to knock the guy out. You know, just like in this situation, two seconds ago these guys were coming to kill you and you killed them, killed them, boom. It happened round over. You know, let's essentially continue following the rules and it, it's weird, it's less about

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       the rules and more about like the respect, you know, it is. And, and on top of that you can pile on the fact that when they were in Hoven Woods, the Germans had booby trapped the, the British bodies. So they were just laying there. They didn't get, they didn't get, they didn't get the same respect back. But I think that's one thing that, that Sydney, Jerry is very intense on throughout the book, is that regardless of how deprived the enemy acts, they are gonna take the high road. Yeah. And you know, I think that's why this book is this book. They give this book to everyone at, uh, at Sandhurst, which is the, the British military academy that gives everyone, I think that's our great reason why, because he sets a standard with his troops and they hold that standard through regardless of the way the enemy behaves, they don't lower themselves to that behavior.

Speaker 1:          02:41:11       You know, the worst atrocity that gets committed by his soldiers is when they spank a Waffen ss guy on the ass. You know, that's, that's why this book is so powerful. And, and you know, there's a lot of, the book is very, it's very, you know, there's, there's stuff in there that you just aren't ready for. Right. Um, even when he was talking about the traits that someone should have, and you, you know, when you start thinking about it, he's right. He's right. And if you had the choice between getting some meat head that was going to go do your bidding, even though he might look like a big beast and he's going to, but then if you think about how's that guy going to act when things get tough or when things become ethically challenging, how's that person going to act? So these are [inaudible] and I love the fact also that men, he's killing people.

Speaker 1:          02:42:08       He's the, you know, it's easy to get caught up in the fact that he's wearing corduroy pants and he's got this, there's a part, there's another part I didn't, didn't go over in the podcast, but there's, there's a group of, of um, German, there's a German, uh, some kind of artillery piece and an artillery team and they're getting the, the Brits are getting their guns dialed in to the team and they're going to start killing them and they make a run for it. And they have horses and there's like six guys and some horses towing this dis artillery piece away. And Sydney, Jerry feels happy. He's happy that the especially happy the horses, like you know, he doesn't like seeing the, the, the, the animals get killed. And so he's actually happy that these guys escape. And then he just says, you know, well that's wrong because these guys are gonna come back and kill my soldiers.

Speaker 1:          02:43:04       So he does a, he, you can see how hard it is for someone to be in these situations where you have the good conscience, which wants to do right thing. And at the same time you got to kill people and that's, that's what makes combat so hard. And He'd been kind of get you thinking back, I remember the Christmas, the Christmas, Christmas where the Germans, the Germans kind of in that situation they initiated that right there. They were like, cause like a mutual initiation but yeah, yeah, yeah. If you remember that particular story. But I think overall it was almost like a mutual initiation. But yes. And that particular story, there was sort of a voice that says, hey, yeah, I'll, okay, I won't cheat you or whatever. And Yeah, man. It's just crazy how that can kind of emerge from these situations where guys are just straight up getting blown to pieces on purpose, by the way.

Speaker 1:          02:44:01       Not, you know, not like some tragic accident like this is, that's the intent. That's the intention. And then they want to just stop and sing together, plays soccer, and then the next day, by the way, they're going back to killing each other on mass. Yeah. Dang. Yeah. That's, that's the thing about, you know, the Yam, you know this, a book like this is so revealing of human nature because business people have to do the same thing. Yeah. You know, if you're a business person and your business is losing money, well guess what? You might have to do cut staff. You know, if you got to, you know, let's say we're working with a small business, you've got a small business, you've got 20 people, you know all those 20 people. Yeah. It's not like a nameless person that you're firing. Right. When you let go four or five people because you need to save money next quarter or you're going to lose your building.

Speaker 1:          02:44:55       Guess what? You're going to know those people. Yeah, and so it's the same dichotomy where this boss, who wants to take care of his people just like Sydney, Jerry wants to take care of his men, and all of a sudden the only way to do your mission is you got to kill it. You've got to, you're going to get some of these people guilt or you're going to fire some of these people. Otherwise our plant shuts down. Otherwise we can't go forward and everyone dies. No one has a job now. So the similarities, again, that's why it's, that's why these things about war reveal so much about human nature, which is really what this podcast is about. It's about human nature and the better you understand human nature, there's two things that can happen. Number one, the better you can lead other people, but equally as important if not more important, is if you understand human nature, you can understand yourself. Yeah. Can understand the decisions that you're making. You can understand why something's bothering you. You can understand what you need to conclude so that you can move forward in the best possible way. And if you don't understand human nature, you're your, I mean that, that's the understanding yourself. Yeah. And these books allows you to gather it and Garner so much of that. Yeah. Especially all the similarities. So many, all

Speaker 5:          02:46:10       the time. I remember in junior high, yeah, it was junior high. Oh, maybe early high school. So when are you split Pop Warner football? Where my best friend played for a different team, but we're all, you know, in pop Warner it's different. It's not by school, it's by like region, you know, like we're not region, I guess town live on coy and no regions go. I don't think anyway, still the, you know, my best friend at the time, his name is Byron, he, uh, who became a pilot by the way, I think. Yeah. Army or Marines, I forget. Anyway. Um, he played for a different team, but we were best friends. So it was kind of that thing, you know, where you're friends with the guys, but then you know, you go in the battlefield and you've gathered battling and you're back to friends. It's weird.

Speaker 5:          02:46:59       You're not killing him though. No Way. Different. Yeah. Did you ever see that in Iraq? Like any of that? Like I dunno, compassion, you know, it did. Yeah, for sure. Even with the enemy titan, not, not so much with the enemy type stuff. So what I mean, but with the civilian types for sure. I mean, I mean obviously, and you'd see guys would go completely out of their way to try and protect the civilian. Uh, the enemy over there is a lot. It's different. Yeah. There's a, there's, you know, here you have a uniformed soldier. Yeah. There you don't have a uniform soldier. You got somebody that's trying to sneak around and blow you up on an IED and

Speaker 1:          02:47:41       yeah, you don't see that same level of now. I mean, once you get a guy captured, that's it, you know? Okay. We've got him captured, zip them up, put them in the back of the Humvee. I mean, that's it. Yeah. So you definitely, what what he talks about is this, this mutual respect of like, look, we're sitting in a slit trench getting mortared. And when I like when I meet you, you're on the other side, but I know that you'd been slipping in the sitting in a slit trench getting mortared all day. That's why we have a mutual respect for each other. Yeah. In Iraq it's asymmetrical warfare. So they're not suffering the same type of situation. Yeah. And they also, you know, one thing that, that really throws that stuff out the window is the way that the insurgence treated the civilian populace. You know, so, so we're witnessing nonjudicial murders.

Speaker 1:          02:48:37       Like when w executions, we're seeing that we're seeing civilians getting tortured, we're seeing, you know, people being beheaded. And so when you see that you're there trying to help these people, and you start to think, look, if you're another infantry men and an opposing army, I can, I can empathize with you. I can understand what you're going through. But if you're, even if you're another army, but I see you raping, torturing, murdering, burning people. I don't empathize with you anymore. It doesn't work that way. So not really. Yeah, makes sense. Now you wouldn't get, occasionally you'd get like you could tell that someone would be mixed up in something that they shouldn't have been mixed up in maybe a young kid, you know, maybe a 17, 18 year old cause cause some of those kids, some of the insurgents were not the [inaudible] Lee, you know, pro al Qaeda.

Speaker 1:          02:49:35       Some of them were just, hey look, I'm going to get paid 50 bucks to put an IED in the road. My gig. Yeah. Yeah. And, and if you paid me 50 bucks to go and plant, you know, crop over there, I'd just as soon do that. Yeah. So you'd see some of that, there'd be, okay, look this, this kid's just, you know, he just caught up in stuff that doesn't understand. And then again, I mean, all I think again, the dichotomy is if you're putting an IUD in the road to kill Americans, bro, I don't care about you. I want to kill you. Yeah. Um, that's all there is to that. And it's definitely a different scenario when the, when the people that you're fighting or

Speaker 1:          02:50:15       are the ones that are committing these kinds of atrocities. Cause even as these guys, you know, they, they, you'd see how you differentiate between like the Waffen ss and like a normal infantry group. He differentiates those two. Yeah. That'd be like if, let's say the war in Iraq was against, let's say al Qaeda had taken over Iraq and you were fighting give a hardened al Qaeda guys or some normal, you know, infantry men for the Iraqi army. Yeah. Those guys, you would have been like, hey look, this dude surrendered. Okay. Yeah. The Al Qaeda guys, first of all, they're probably not going to surrender. And if they do, that's they're going to knock at the same treatment that a, that a guy that's a victim of circumstance, right. Lot of the Germans are a victim of circumstance. Hey, this guy came into power. I was a soldier. I'm still a soldier, you know, and Ah man, just heavy it is. But there is a definitely a mutual respect that you have for, for another servicemen that's, you know, has been through the same kind of crap that you've been through. Yeah, yeah man, it makes sense.

Speaker 5:          02:51:22       So with that speaking a heavy lifting kettle bells anyway, I feel like we should talk about on it on a Greek kettle bells again, I do feel spoiled even every time I pick them up, even though they're dope. You know the, the artistic ones, should we call them artistic cause they have names, right? Primal bells. Yeah. Just call him that legend bells.

Speaker 4:          02:51:47       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:51:47       All that stuff. You know, I feel kind of spoiled because they're kind of like the designer once their designer ish balanced by the way you, the way I got into that. Um,

Speaker 5:          02:51:59       here's the thing about the car, and I said this before, starting light with kettle bells critical. My friend Anthony came over, I don't know if you remember Anthony was there the first day we recorded, he was at my house. Oh yeah. So he came over the other day and he was like, yeah, yeah, let's lift. And you know, last time I seen him, I wasn't so much into the kettle bells. So I was like, all right, we're doing this thing. Be careful. And I saw him and he had, I don't think he'd ever done it. No, but he just, he grabbed the latest one and you know, I said start light or whatever. And you could tell his, I'm gonna say this with all due respect, if you haven't done it before, it makes sense. But like his form was way off and I'm thinking, Bro, you're going to get hard.

Speaker 5:          02:52:41       Okay. Careful. Yeah. So I wasn't going to go into like what crazy workout I did, but I'll save that for another time for three hours right now or no, I just looked at my watch to 53 that's not a good sign. So I apologize to everyone in the world for doing a three and a half hour podcast, which isn't going to turn into a faculty, describes his last 14 workouts, four and a half hours. Great detail nonetheless. So we'll credit krill oil real quick. I was talking to somebody at the muster, I think it was, I forget who it was, nonetheless was talking about the benefits yet again, this is like a common thing. It's true. I don't exaggerate about the Krill oil is still kind of like, I can't go back to not taking krill oil. Krill oil and I don't mind. Oh actually we were talking to life.

Speaker 5:          02:53:29       Remember he ran out of crow? Yeah, and he's all mad at me because he gave me some, I didn't bring any. Yeah, actually technically, technically it was Jenna Lee who brought me some. I think I just gave the order nonetheless. He gave me. Yeah, so I guess he and I had a part of it. Got The credit. He'll nonetheless, I'll never go back to no krill oil. So where would you get it on it? Krill oil. What if you wanted to save money? Go on it.com/chocolate there's a lot of things on there and on it is one of those good companies slash website where anything you need, like anything you need supplementation with all the way down to workouts. They got it on there. Try your best not to get too addicted to the website because it's very vast. Very rare. The only person that has that issue, I don't think so.

Speaker 5:          02:54:16       I will guaranteed spend time like watching the videos and stuff, browsing the products. Sometimes you can get like we talked about the, you know how you get on Amazon and you're like, yeah, I want to get that thing too. You don't really need, it just looks super cool. It's one of those websites was on does that? Yeah. So be careful. It does, but I don't think it had like prompts you. It's just the list of stuff is all cool. You know, it's not just a kettle bell, it's the really cool one, you know? So it's, it's that situation anyway on it.com/chocolate if you want the 10% off. And um, yeah, report back. Tell me what you think and if you asked me about the Krill oil, I'll tell you, I'll tell you till the end of time. I will not not take krill oil ever again.

Speaker 5:          02:55:00       If I have anything to say about it. Another way to support is when you pick up your copy of 18 platoon or whichever books you choose that Jocko reads on this podcast. Go on our website, Jocko, podcast.com go to the book section on the top says books from episodes. Click through their heads up. If you're looking to get 18 platoon the book, you actually, you can get it on Amazon used. Yeah. For like 40 bucks and used copy, which they'll all be gone. Yeah, yeah. By the time chilling, whoever you are listening to this, you can also get it from a website rifles, direct.com which actually supports the rifles regiment in the UK. So, um, you can get it there as well. Or you can buy the used to hardcover copies from amazon.com after you click through, click through there, boom. And you know, even if you're a buying something else, hey, click through support the cause anyway.

Speaker 5:          02:56:03       Another way, subscribe to the podcast on Itunes, stitcher, Google play, and any other podcasts providing platforms also and not excluding youtube. Youtube is a good one video version. I got youtube red by the way. Hey, wait, wait. What's the benefits again of the, one of the benefits is on youtube rep you can listen to you. Even if you go to another APP, it's still playing. So it's a real, it's a real cool deal for me. I'm in sounds [inaudible] I liked to add. I know you do. That's relevant most of the time unless you see the same ad over and over and again, you don't have to, you know when they play, you ever see the same oil, you don't see ads anymore. No. But there's who may or may not enjoy ads and or still have the older person that enjoys ads. You guys, she must, you know, you know how it like here for example, so ty Lopez, right?

Speaker 5:          02:57:05       He'll have like ad every single time. I know you know that there's this other financial company, which is a weird one, which is really, it's a really poorly done nonetheless. So ty Lopez, he was the example. Ty Lopez, he'll be like, he'll talk about some stuff and then after it's the same ad over and over and after awhile you're like, okay, okay, skip the ad. But then it kind of sticks with you and then you're kinda like, yeah, that's called advertising sucked in. Yeah. But it's kind of like, I see what's going on yet. I still am compelled, you know? So it's like, it's kind of like, it's beneficial almost. I'm over here not compelled, compelled fill. No. Anyway, I am compelled to to subscribe to Youtube. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. There you go. So we're trying to say you're sending a lot of other stuff going on.

Speaker 5:          02:57:49       Go on these tangents and it's relevant. I feel like people can relate on some level, sometimes. Maybe occasionally, maybe weird people nonetheless. Youtube. That's a good video version. What's the, uh, what's Jocko podcast is the channel. Yeah. [inaudible] yeah, sure. It'd be cool if you put videos on there more often. I do just before I put like two or three a week. Oh yeah. Two, three weeks now. Kind of. Okay, good. I'm looking forward to that new, whatever. I pick number one on the other. What does Monday? Yeah. Okay. That's one. It's whatever it is right now. Thursday. No worries. I got you. Good. Subscribe to that if you haven't already. And you can get the video version and excerpts which are sharable, sharable, meaning they're just shorter and shorter. So you know, whoever opens it, they ain't going to be more of a chance. I'm going to listen to it when it's two, three minutes long rather than two and a half, three and a half.

Speaker 5:          02:58:46       In this case, hours long. That's just how fired from doing podcasts cause they're too long. Is that possible? Maybe. Hmm. I guess how these else, anything is possible, right? That's the thing. Um, what else? Uh, Jocko has a store, it's called Jocko store website, Jocko store.com. See? Catchy, right? Easy to remember. If it's a store and it's jock was his chocolate store. If it's a podcast and it's [inaudible] is Jocko podcasts, if it's, you know, if it's key chains. I was meeting some peach key chains, some people talking to some people at a group the other day. Sure. We're not familiar with me or with anything. Good respect. And they, they said, oh well do you, you know, one of them said, oh he's got a podcast. And then the other one said, oh, what's the name of the podcast? And I said, all the podcasts is called Jocko podcast.

Speaker 5:          02:59:44       And she said, this one girl said, did you pay your marketing team a lot for that day? And I said yes. In fact, I did exactly real original like that. Yup. Original but hey man could be worse. So back to the store, Jocko store, that is some tee shirts on there. If you want to represent, uh, you know the tee shirts carry a message. The message has layers. Actually, I guess technically the shirts have layers because the message is one of the layers of it. The shirt anyway, go on there and store.com if you like something, get something that's a good way to start wars shirts coming out this week. That's my question to you. That's the intention. I'm getting angry. Yes, I understand. I understand. But no, make me not in your business. Normal face, normal face. My face is way normal. The don't make me come and get in your business and do your job for you.

Speaker 5:          03:00:39       Because if you've ever heard me talk on this podcast, I talk about when people don't do their job, that's awesome. Cause then I can take their job from them. Right, right. You got to step down and think about where I'm more of my mindset is. And you may want to step it up over on a year end all. Dang. You're about to jump into the song. I, yeah, yeah, yeah. None. No respect. I am. I dig it and we're gonna try to get that shirts for, you know, let's, do you know why you're saying this right now? Because you can't wait for the shirt that you designed to come up. Also, I think you're, I think you might be, um, really sabotaging and sabotaging my efforts. I made the better shirt. Uh Huh. And you don't want to print it because you're self conscious and that's not going to stand well. I will give you the respect because there is in fact layers to this shirt as well, so. All right. How about this? More layers. More layers you, oh yeah, yeah. You could be right. I think you might have more layers than the standard,

Speaker 5:          03:01:39       I guess. We'll see. We're going to find out about that one. Anyway, Jocelyn, start icon, so women's stuff on there as well. Some patches, some rash guards, some cool rash guards. Yeah, indeed. Hoodies, other stuff. Anyway, go on there. Check it out. If you want something, get something. Good way to support. Also psychological warfare. If you're having trouble, if you're having trouble, if you're like me and sometimes you stew or currently having trouble with not feeling like working out, not feeling like it, so you're considering skipping the workout, waiting for tomorrow, making your workout day into a rest day. If you're having that problem, this is what you do. Go psychological warfare, search on iTunes, Google play, Amazon, Amazon, all these things anyway where you can get mp3s, you search psychological warfare, Jocko Willink, and it's an album

Speaker 5:          03:02:32       with traffic and these tracks will help you through anything that you're feeling. That weakness, like I just mentioned, whether it be waking up early or skipping the workout or cheating on the Diet and I say cheating on the Diet because you made a promise to yourself, you're not going to eat those donuts. You made a promise and then now like all of us eat the donuts. No, that's not the promise you made. Just like I can never eat a doughnut again. No, sure. Exactly right. You can't, everyone in the world will like, someone will get better there with a, with a camera and they'll get me and consider this like what if you knew 100% no one's watching or whatever and then you're eating the doughnut. Can you imagine the guilt? You're feeling guilt. Yeah, he can't do it. You're done. Don't, not to too much guilt, but in the event of other people, not you dropped with other people feeling that weakness.

Speaker 5:          03:03:25       There's the track for that. Remember back when I phone Kinda came out and there's that thing. There's an APP for that. Remember that used to always say that, oh there's an app for that. There's an APP for that. That was like an expression. See, look with this. There's a track for that. Jimmy was saying, just made that up right now. Anyway, psychological warfare, check it if you need, if you need that, that spot because really that's what it is. It's a spot in life when you're trying to lift heavy things. It's good to have a spot if you're lifting light or not lifting at

Speaker 1:          03:03:58       all. You didn't need a spot, so don't even worry about that. If you're not doing nothing, don't even get this. You don't even need it. If you're not doing anything in life, don't get it. You see what I'm saying? Makes Sense, right? I'm get it. Exactly right. All right. Like I said, 18 will tune. You can get that at rifles, direct.com from the UK. It supports that regimen, which I'm all about. Also, you know, speaking of rash guards and stuff, check out origin main.com my boy up there, Pete Roberts, these kind of these kind of psycho actually kind of a mad man. He's all about manufacturing in America, which I'm all about too, and I'm going to go into this, but at some point, but like he wanted to make gies here and he couldn't get the fabric, so he went out and bought old abandoned looms from abandoned factories.

Speaker 1:          03:04:43       I had hired like old timers that knew how to work these things and refurbish them and rebuilt them and has made these looms, brought them back to life so that he can make gies and rash guards here in America in Maine. And like I said, that's kind of crazy. Borderline psychopathic, which I kind of like and that's kind of why we're, we're kind of working on joining forces in some way. A P origin. Warpath it's going down. We're going to make something happen. I'll keep everyone informed as we finalize the plan. That rash guard that you mentioned and posted the video that was a lot nicer is a lot. Oh yeah, Easter and legit. I, when you see it, it's underplayed it. You're like, yeah, well you didn't know I made it. I made it sound like just kind of cheesy. Yeah. Like you didn't realize it was actually sad.

Speaker 1:          03:05:42       But the thing is that rash guard, it's our, I had already sold out. I know. So now he's printing a bunch more but, but he's got, he's got a weave the material. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Or it gets, he gets one of his producers here in America. We have materials. So anyways, check out that origin main.com growing company. We're getting in league with them big time. Um, also Jocko white tea on Amazon. Here's a, here's an actual, again, this is a certified verified report. I have a cat that used to catch one or two mice per month. I forgot to pick up the tea bag after I brewed it and the cat ate the tea bag. Now my cat is bringing home raccoons, full grown rabbits and even the neighbor's dog. So be careful. Don't let your cat get it unless your neighbor's dogs being annoyed.

Speaker 1:          03:06:35       No, that's Jocko white tea. You can have it and it's not, it doesn't take the thing. It doesn't taste like normal tea. It tastes like victory. All right. Way The war, your kid. Boom. Also, this is a warning about way the warrior kid. When you order way of the warrior kid, just go ahead and also order a pull up bar, some flashcards, some healthy food, edit, Jujitsu G. Cause when your kid gets done reading this factually, if they're going to want to be stronger, better, tougher and smarter. So supply them the way they need to be supplied. Quit playing around. Get some. Also the discipline equals freedom field manual.

Speaker 1:          03:07:18       There's no book like this doesn't exist. It is not a normal book. It's kind of like the podcast. This podcast is not for everyone. Not everyone wants to listen to this podcast. That's okay. I'm not making a podcast for everyone. We're making a podcast for people that like to get after it. So this book is not for people that want to read, um, junk. Sure. Some people don't get the podcast. Some people aren't going to understand the book. They're not gonna know where it's coming from. That's okay. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not towing. We're not toning down the podcast right now. We're not saying, Oh, you know what? I think everyone would like it more if we did more, you know, interspersed some, some jokes throughout it and maybe if we made it 45 minutes and do the little fun presentation and can I get some backup music just to kind of have little jangled to make people get in the spirit. We're not doing that. Not Happening. If you want to listen to a little jangle or a little, you know, metallic riff to get you in the zone on the beginning of the podcast, that's cool. Then if you want that, that's awesome. There's other podcasts that offer, we don't offer it here. You know what you're going to get with the book if you're looking for, you know, um, 50 shades of gray and you're not going to get that.

Speaker 1:          03:08:44       It's a, but that's the cool thing. The cool thing is that the publisher let me do whatever I wanted to do. So I did and I made the gear and to feel you're going to feel that the, that the feeling of the podcast is the same feeling that the book gets you. So it's a little heavy, little dark, right? Sparse, right? Sure. Get after it. That's in there anyways. Discipline equals freedom field manual order it. It's, it's not printed. I'll give you an looming give you an example. It's not printed on white paper, so the straight up, let's just go from there. It's actually printed. The background is all images, black and white images. I know that comes as a big surprise to everyone for sure and then put over that his words. So there you go. Little indicator as to what the, the field manuals like you can get that good preorder it. Now of course extreme ownership. It's a little book. It's about leadership actually. It's about combat leadership and how you can take the combat leadership principles that we learned on the battlefield and apply them to your life. You can get that book too if you want it.

Speaker 1:          03:10:07       We also have echelon front consulting me, Leif Babin, JP Denelle, Dave Burke. We will come and help your team align your leadership so you can crush your enemies. You just heard Sydney Jerry saying it. A leadership is the thing that makes you overcome seemingly impossible things. So if your leadership isn't squared away, you're not going to overcome them. So you need to get in the game. You can contact us info at echelon, front.com if you want that.

Speaker 4:          03:10:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:10:40       Also the monster. We just got back from the Austin Muster. Outstanding. Outstanding. It was awesome. So many great people in their lessons learned. Knowledge spread.

Speaker 4:          03:10:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:10:52       Tim Kennedy was there. Tim Kennedy showed up. Uh, and it was cool and I didn't realize it until we were at Jujitsu. And I think I came up to you and said this during Jujitsu. So the last night we have Thursday, then Friday and then Friday night we go do Jujitsu. We went to 10th planet at, uh, Austin, Austin, 10th planet Jiu Jitsu with my boy Curtis Curtis. Todd White was there and Todd White, right? Yeah. He's an old school. Like he's, me and him are from that same era. Yeah. We're, we're from the same era. From back in the day only. He's only, he's a better artist. A better artist than me. Yep. So well, we went in and what I realized is this, you don't like a way the warrior kid, people say, aw man, I wish I had that book when I was a kid. Yeah. And extreme ownership. People say, aw man, I wish I had that.

Speaker 1:          03:11:47       I wish I had that book when I started out in my, you know what I got promoted five years ago. And you know what I say about way the warrior kid. I wish I had it when I was a kid. You know what I say about extreme ownership. I wish I had it when I was a assistant platoon commander. I wish I had it. Yeah, I didn't have it. And what's cool about the monster is so that feeling when you go to the monster you're giving dislike or just given this massive amount of inflammation, pragmatic information that you can take and you can execute with. Yeah. And so when we were at Jujitsu, I realized, man, we just all this stuff, these people in this room just got all this information and it, and it's so practical that you can take back to your team.

Speaker 1:          03:12:30       And then on top of all that, here's a little something else. Jujitsu. Yeah. Because, um, well only one quarter of the people that came to Jujitsu had ever trained Jujitsu before the other, what was 50 people that had never trained before. So they're getting this gift, the gift of Jujitsu in true. Yeah. Little. And they all, I would say 50% of them will go back and start training. Yeah. Maybe more. I wish it was 100% yeah, it might be. It might be. Yeah, it'd be, yeah. It depends on what you're into your, yeah, it's hard. It was always bizarre to me that when I introduced to someone as a Jujitsu, it was a 100% conversion rate. It should be a 100% conversion rate. 100% Oh, you just choked me and I couldn't stop you. I need to learn that a hundred percent otherwise I go through life vulnerable to being choked by anyone.

Speaker 1:          03:13:19       I don't like that feeling. Yeah. No, I don't like that the muster two is sprinkled in. I don't and I mean heart sprinkled hard by the way, which is a very critical, compelling part in my opinion is this the social stuff. And I don't mean social like you're just cruising and not learning. I mean the people you meet. Oh yeah. Well you definitely are going to meet good people there because everyone there is in the game big time and they're all looking to get better. They're all invested to get better. And, and the other thing is, you know we're hanging out. I ha I see all the time. Yeah, no there's me. Lafe Dave, Jp Echo. We're not, there's no green room. It doesn't exist. We don't even take breaks. Just like when, when we take a break to let the audience like go to the restroom or grab a, you know a cup of coffee or Jocko white tea.

Speaker 1:          03:14:10       We, we just, we just stand there like we stepped down office agent, we get everyone lines up when we talk questions. And you know what I was doing this time was I was like, instead of answering one person's question, just to that person I was going, hey everyone career, cause he's asking a question that everyone coming over a nearby, there's, there's, there's 12 people standing in line. Yeah. Instead of answering this one question, this one guy whispering, know, hey everyone come up here and you can all hear this because who knows, maybe there's some of those questions. Maybe it's something we're gonna experience in the future. I don't know. But you might as well listen and maybe you have a better solution than I have. Yeah. So it's like a, like a little little brainstorm brainstorm, right? Yeah. Yeah. It's cool. That's true. You, we take breaks.

Speaker 1:          03:14:51       Everyone. There's break throughout the known you take bricks, Jacqueline, don't take breaks for us. Break time is talk ties, talk to you guys, sign a book, whatever. No Green Room, no green room. So that's the muster. Um, and by the way, they've sold out all of them that we've done have been sold out. Now the next one that we got coming up is September 14th and 15th back at the Omni Hotel in downtown San Diego, California. Muster zero zero four it's gonna sell out. This is a known fact, so if you want to come, it's September 14th and 15th. That is right around the corner. So if you want to come to that, come to that extreme ownership.com is where you can register if you want to. Also my, the way this is interesting, if you train Jujitsu or if you're interested in training, Jujitsu, origin up in Maine has this immersion camp that they do.

Speaker 1:          03:15:52       I'm going echo's going with me. We're going up. There it is. There's two sessions that they run. It's the 20th August 20 the 23rd or August 24th through the 27th those are the two different sessions or you can come for the whole week. Anyways, I'm going to be there for those middle three days, like Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. So I'm going to be there for the last day of the first camp and the first day of the law of the second camp and it'll be on there on the Middle Day. We're going to be training, rolling, talking, hanging out, eating lobster, eating steaks, uh, just generally getting after it. So you got to origin main.com if you want to come up. There's not a lot of spaces for that. They, it's, it's, it's not, that's like, I think the most they're going to go is 200 people. So that's not a lot of spaces.

Speaker 1:          03:16:42       So if you want to come up, register quick and I'll see you guys up there in Maine. I'm going to, what I like about it is unlike the muster where everything is scheduled, like we don't have a lot of break time and even the break times we're working this thing. I mean you can only train Jujitsu what, six hours a day maybe. You know what I mean? Two hours in the morning, two hours at lunch, two hours in the evening. So that's six hours. You know, you're going to sleep four hours. So you still got 14 hours left in the day. So what are we going to do? We're going to kick it. Yeah. We're going to cruise. There's a lake, there's Kayaks, there's a zip lines and whatever. Yeah. Oh, we'll just go lay in bed and try and recover from the Jiu Jitsu sessions. So yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:17:26       Um, a bunch of good people coming up renewed after that. If you want to come up and hang out, do it. And that will work. We'll see you up there either at the muster or we'll see you at the immersion Jujitsu camp. How do you register for that one? Origin main.com. And then you click on the immersion thing and you'll find it. You Press Google, figure it out. Yeah. Yeah. There's a certain element of like, if you can't figure it out, don't bother. Yeah. And there's also a certain element of like, Hey, register now and, and go to this thing today, register today. And they always think today. Yeah, I know. They say that today. By the time this podcast comes out, it won't even be today. So, uh, all right. Also until we're at one of those events.
