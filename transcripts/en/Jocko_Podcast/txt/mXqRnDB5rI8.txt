Speaker 1:          00:00          This is Jocko podcast number 51 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening.

Speaker 2:          00:14          Forgotten.

Speaker 1:          00:18          The Korean War is often referred to as the forgotten war and it's sandwiched between deep, massive world war two and then on the other side, the highly controversial and also highly televised and therefore highly remembered Vietnam War. So I guess in that middle of that, the Korean War somehow gets lost and I guess somehow gets forgotten. No, obviously we should never forget. The war in Korea was brutal. And in many ways when you look at the Korean War, you see the worst parts of these, all other wars, you had the trenches of world war one, you had the bitter cold of the eastern front. In World War II, you have the landmines of the Vietnam War. And for the nearly 2 million that served in Korea and the more than 100,000 that were wounded, we should never forget. And we must never forget. And for the 36,516 Americans that were killed. We must always remember always and remember that for those that died, there is nothing else. There's nothing else. They gave everything. Everything they gave for a few meters in between trenches are for hill or for their brothers in arms. That's what war does. That gives everything to som and it takes everything from others.

Speaker 2:          02:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:33          Tert tonight we begin to take a look at the Korean War through the eyes of James Brady, United States Marine Corps in his book the coldest war.

Speaker 2:          02:47          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:54          What job are you looking for? I knew the answer and snapped

Speaker 2:          03:00          it back. Rifle platoon leader, sir. The major said that I was a hard charger, that they needed hard chargers in the basic school in Virginia where they trained marine lieutenants, they ask you every few hours that same question. Then they push a form at you to write down your four first three choices of duty. There are several schools of thought about this one held. You should tell the truth. Those who subscribe to this odd notion put down communications or tanks or mountain training. Anything that might delay assignment to a replacement draft and the war. Another advise diplomacy, a first choice of rifle platoon leader to show your spirit. Then what you really hope for logistics or motor transport. A third school felt you should lie. Brazenly indicating ferocious demand for a rifle platoon on grounds that this might impress people and get you made a general's aide.

Speaker 1:          04:00          Mac Allen achieved something of a name at basic school by stipulating quite honestly, each time. Rifle platoon leader, rifle platoon leader, rifle platoon leader. I didn't worry about it much, not out of fatalism, but simply because I believe the marine corps discarded all such forms without reading. And it didn't matter much what you wrote this close to the line. I was too embarrassed to give any answer, but the one, the major obviously wanted to hear splendid, said the major, we have an opening for a hard charger. Second Battalion Colonel Gregory's battalion. They want, yeah.
