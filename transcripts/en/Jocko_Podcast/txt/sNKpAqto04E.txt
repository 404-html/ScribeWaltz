Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number one 74 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. So I was the commander of the training detachment, which runs the tactical kind of advanced training for the west coast seal teams. And when I was in that position, one of the things that you have to do when you're in a leadership position is you have to give a valuations for everyone that works for you. You have to basically write down and evaluate how good they are and how well they do their job. This is normal for everyone in the navy. Then everyone in the military really. And in the navy it's a 5.0 system that you're getting graded on. So 5.0 is the best and 1.0 is the worst. I don't know if even go lower than that. You probably can, but there, and there are rules about how many people you can put at the top.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       You have to for, it's called forced ranking. If you ever heard of that, forced ranking means you have to actually rank everyone. So if you have 10 people working for you, you have to rank. This is my number one guy, this is my number two guy all the way down through number 10 and this is what you cannot do is you can't just say, hey, everyone's great. Everyone's a 5.0 that's, that's, you're not allowed to do that. And believe it or not, that's what people would do. Most people would just have to evaluate someone. Guess what they say, Hey, you're great. You do everything great. And you wouldn't think that the military, the military would have a hard time telling people like, hey, here's some areas where you need to improve. You wouldn't think that the military, especially like the seal teams, you're the big tough seal is going to have a hard time telling some someone, hey, this is where your performances could be better.

Speaker 1:          00:01:59       Right? But actually no one likes having those hard conversations. I shouldn't say just about no one likes having those hard conversations. And in fact, this is completely evident in the fact that there was an old evaluation system when I first got into the navy and there you didn't have to force rank, you could just make everyone perfect basically on paper. And that's actually what happened. That system was a 4.0 system. So it was a 4.0 was the highest that you could get and everyone was a 4.0 guy. Everyone got four point ohs in everything. And actually you have to take that back. And I think I might've talked about this before, but my first evaluation that I got at a seal team, I wasn't even in a platoon yet, but I was going through the initial training that you used to do to seal team. When you got to the seal team, you did something called Stt, which was stood for seal tactical training and it basically taught you the, is a little bit more advanced skills than you learned in buds. And I got a 4.0 and everything, but I actually got a 3.8 in a category called human relations.

Speaker 1:          00:03:14       And I was, I guess, you know, I talked to my friends though, we got 4.0 and everything and everyone got four point except for me, I got the 3.8 and so then you're supposed to get a counseling right from, and the officer that had written my, the officer that had written my evaluation and giving me all 4.0 4.0 in tactics, 4.0 and that's 4.0 and the other thing. And then a 3.8 and human relations. And he had to counsel me cause that's what you have to do. You have to go through and make sure that no one objects. And he, he looked at me and he said, you know, I I give you a 3.8 in, you know, in human relations because well because I think you're a little too hard on people that are, that are unsat.

Speaker 1:          00:04:00       And I kind of took pride in that, you know, cause I, at that time I wasn't really playing the game. You know, I kinda was thinking to myself, yeah, Aye Aye. That's right. You know, if you're UNSAT I am going to be hard on you and you can probably guess of the group that I was in, which individual I was harder on than any one else who was actually that guy. So that was kind of funny. But you know, after that, after I got into a seal platoon then all, you know, everything was 4.0 all the time. And again, I'm not bragging at all about that because every single guy, we all had 4.0 it crossed the board on everything and everyone was the best seal in the seal teams ever in the history of ever. That's what it was like. And everyone was this just this, just the way it was.

Speaker 1:          00:04:46       Everyone was the best soap. The navy realize this. Basically the navy realized that all the leaders were cowards and when it came to telling the truth to the troops about where they stood and where they can improve. So they made, they made a change, they made this drastic change to the evaluation and they changed to this thing called forced ranking where whatever there was percentages on how many people could be ranked at the highest level, like it was like 10% of your people can be ranked at the highest level and then 20% of the next tier and went on down the line. You didn't actually have to rank someone as bad but you couldn't rank a bunch of people at the top and it was, it actually made a, made a big difference all of a sudden because now all of a sudden you had to, if you were in a leadership position, you had to give your, some of your people some lower rankings when you actually had to figure out who is better and eventually what they did is that again, people not wanting to have hard conversations.

Speaker 1:          00:05:45       Eventually what they did is, because how you advance in the navy is based on your evaluations, which is what we're talking about. But it's also based on how much time you have in grade. So you can't, if you make, if you're an [inaudible], you can't make a five for three years or there's some, some random number, like you cannot make a five for three years. And so what they started doing is just ranking you based on how long you were there for. And so that's, that's what they started doing. So basically it didn't really help because you still ended up just saying, oh well you know, you, you're just new and that's why you didn't get promoted. Well, I didn't really understand that when the first, when the very first of the forced ranking evaluations came out, I had just made e five and because I had just made e five I got ranked at the bottom of the fives in my platoon.

Speaker 1:          00:06:42       And like I said, at this time I wasn't really playing the game really fully. So I was Kinda went to my chief and my and my lieutenant with, hey, why am I, why am I at the bottom? W W how, how can I be the lowest ranking of the fives because that's just wrong. What about this guy here? You know, one of my, this guy over here, you're telling me that this guy is doing a better job than I am. Cause I was working really hard and doing a good job and they didn't disagree with me. What they said. It's like, look, yes Jocko, you're, you're, you're definitely doing a better job than that guy and that guy. But here's the deal. They're up for promotion and you're not. And when you're up for promotion, you'll be at the top when it's your turn. And again, I wasn't really playing the game, so I said, Oh okay, I get it.

Speaker 1:          00:07:30       Why didn't you just tell me that were communists? It was what's going on there. And you know, there are no, we're not communists. It's just, you know, this is just the way that the system work. And I said, okay, so what you're telling me is this is the communist system as well as what's happening. Thanks comrade. And of course they did their best to explain it to me and I didn't really listen because like I said, don't, it wasn't really playing the game at this time. I was a young, you know, e five getting after it, but eventually it was me that was evaluating people and force ranking them. And then it was me that was explaining the rules of why people got ranked, where they got ranked and why I gave him the grades that I gave him. And of course I did this a bunch from when I was an assistant platoon commander and a platoon commander and a task unit commander.

Speaker 1:          00:08:20       So I had done this a bunch of, now I was the officer in charge of the training attachment and I had one of the guys that didn't like where he got ranked. He, he was, he, he didn't like it. He thought he deserved higher and he, he thought he deserved a bunch of five o's that the highest possible grade and Oh, you know, maybe not on all the criteria but on some of them. And he actually requested on office call with me, meaning he wanted to come and talk to me, which was kind of weird because at this time people literally would just walk in my office all the time and say, Hey, what's up? I got to, you know, they were talking about something I was super casual about people coming to see me. No, no factor. Right. So when this guy went and actually organized an official meeting with me, I was, you know, I was totally cool with it, but it was weird.

Speaker 1:          00:09:10       And he came in and he had his evaluation with them and he put it on my desk and you know, he said something along the lines of, you know, I got ranked in the middle of the pack and how did this happen and I should be at the top or, or at least I should be near it and I should have five o's. And in this category and that Cody Gillrie and this other category and the guy himself, he wasn't a slacker by any stretch of imagination. Who was what goods, really solid seal. He wasn't like an over the top outstanding front runner, but he was really, really solid, which you only allowed to have a very small number of guys that you're ranking as front runners. And he wasn't there. And you know, I was, I was better at this point at playing the game, you know, up and down the chain of command.

Speaker 1:          00:09:59       And so what I did was I sat there and I listened to them and I listened to his perspective. And as I was doing that, as I was listening this guy and I was thinking to myself, you know, this guy's a hardworking seal. He thinks he should have higher grades across the board. He thinks he should be a top ranked guy with five point ohs. And as I'm sitting there listening to him, I'm thinking, why does he actually think that? Why does he think that? What? What is going on in his head that he thinks that he should be a 5.0 and of course I'm thinking to myself, this is somehow my fault. This has gotta be my fault because I'm the leader and I have a guy, I have a guy that's concerned enough about his rankings that he's in here talking to me.

Speaker 1:          00:10:42       He actually set an appointment to come and talk to me about this. So obviously I have not done a good job at this point of explaining things to him. And if I'm, if I'm, if he doesn't get it, obviously there's gonna be more people that, that think the same way, then you know, he's not the only one when someone comes to the problem, they're not the only one. So that's what I'm thinking and I'm, um, I'm thinking that he's thinking he's a 5.0 that's what he's thinking. He's thinking he's a 5.0 and he's not, and he thinks he should be. And then I'm trying to figure out, I'm thinking to myself, okay, how do I explain to him where he is missing the mark? How can I explain to him that he's not quite a 5.0 because 5.0 is outstanding and then the answer kind of jumped out at me. The answer was the evaluation form itself. That's, that's what it was because the evaluation form itself actually gives the definition of what a 5.0 sailor is what a 5.0 liter is. And really when you break it down to what a 5.0 human being is the evaluation actually spells it out in plain English. So I picked up the evaluation form that he had brought in and I started to read chunks of it to him.

Speaker 1:          00:12:11       So the first little chunk that I read to read to him, there's a section called professional knowledge and, and if you are a 5.0 in professional knowledge, it gives you a list of what you are. And here's what it says. If you're a five point on professional knowledge, this is what it says, recognized expert, sought out by all for technical knowledge, uses knowledge to solve complex technical problems, meets advancement requirements early and with distinction. So you know, I looked at him and said, okay, recognized expert. Are you a recognized expert? Does how often are you getting called by the east coast or by the seal team to help them solve a problem? The answer was he's not. He's a good solid guy, really good instructor, but he's not a, he's not a recognized expert and he knew it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:14       And then I read the the 3.0 which is a middle grade. Like, Hey, this is your average situation. I said, maybe this is you. I said, listen, strong working knowledge of rating specialty and job reliably applies knowledge to accomplish tasks, meets advancement requirements on time. This is a solid human being, right? This is a solid, that's a, that's a 3.0 right there. And again, as I'm reading through this, this guy, yeah, he had strong working knowledge for sure. He was applying that knowledge to his job for sure. He was doing that. So that's cool. That's 3.0 what about quality of work? Another section, quality of work. Here's a 5.0 for quality of work needs. No supervision. Always produces exceptional work. No rework required maximizes resources, so need to know resources. Let's think about that. I mean, this guy was working in another department. He was definitely being managed and then always produces exceptional work. Again, this is as good can it get any better than exceptional?

Speaker 2:          00:14:26       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:14:28       So I said, is that you? Do you not need any supervision? And he knew. I mean, I know I worked in the departments. I know what's going on. He, he's not going to, you can't lie to me. And I said, how about this needs little supervision, produces quality work. Few errors, uses resources efficiently. You know what that is? That's 3.0 hmm. I actually gave you a 4.0 somewhere in between those two. I'm actually being kind of generous. What do you think? How about military bearing and character with, let's see what that looks like. Here's what, here's what, here's what the definition for military bearing and characterised us navy 5.0 evaluation. Exemplary personal appearance, model of conduct, conduct on and off duty. A leader in physical readiness exemplifies navy core values. Honor, courage, commitment.

Speaker 1:          00:15:26       Now, this guy is sitting in my office, he's in sloppy PT gear. His hair's a little bit long and he's not, he's not one of these superstud seals. That's an awesome physical shape. He's kind of a guy that liked to party a bit and he was a hardworking seal. A great guy. But I'm saying he wasn't exactly a model of conduct on and off duty. Think about what that means. A model of conduct. So that's 5.0 then I said, listen, let me tell you what I tell them, but let me tell you what 3.0 is excellent. Personal appearance, excellent conduct, conscientiously complies with regulations, complies with physical readiness program, lives up to navy core values, honor, courage, commitment. That that to me, you know you're a pretty squared away guy, but how'd you do on that last PT test? Right? Cause you, you didn't knock it out of the park.

Speaker 1:          00:16:14       I know that. Right? So you are you telling him? Yes, you're reading, reading. I'm just doing what we're doing right here. I'm straight up reading them to them cause cause it was really obvious that these standards are very, very high. And you know also here's the bottom of the barrel. Okay, this is 1.0 1.04 for values or for military bearing and character. This is 1.0 consistently. Unsatisfactorily appearance, poor self control conduct resulting in disciplinary action, unable to meet one or more physical readiness requirements fails to live up to one or more navy core values. Honor, courage, commitment. So, so this guy clearly is not a 1.0 that's a, that's a horse. Know that's a, that's a bad sailor. But this guy's solid. He's in the middle. I think I had him with a four point. I said Aye. Aye. We good with a foro or you going to tell me that you crushed that you were the leader of the pack on the last PT test that we did.

Speaker 1:          00:17:19       You know w when you tell me were you the, were you the 5.0 no. Couldn't honestly say it. And by now he kind of, he kind of got the message that he's no 1.0 but he definitely wasn't a 5.0 either. And, and clearly what I realize is he never actually read through what those standards were. And clearly that was my fault for not making sure that this guy and the rest of the people at my command understood what the grading criteria was. And I started to try and do that and I started to realize that the grading criteria was actually solid and it was a good guide to being a really good seal, a really good sailor, a really good person.

Speaker 1:          00:18:07       And as you read through some of these 5.0 qualities, here's the one for command organizational climate slash equal opportunity. So if you're, this is your, if you're a five oh in this category, measurably contributes to the navy's, increased retention and reduced attrition. Objective, proactive leader, exemplary mentor involved in subordinates, personal development, leading to professional growth and sustained commitment, initiate support programs for military, civilian and families to achieve exceptional command and organizational climate. The model of achievement develops unit cohesion by valuing differences as strengths. So let's think about that. That's, that's a massive, who's going to get five? Oh, in that, in the seal teams, not too many people. Because in the seal teams who's initiating support programs means you're actively starting a program to help support, right? There's not a lot of guys, they're going to hit 5.0 and that's the way it should be.

Speaker 1:          00:19:05       Here's what, 5.0 it looks like for personal job accomplishment and initiative, energetic self starter completes tasks or qualifications early far better than expected. So you're not just doing, you're doing it early and it's still even better than everyone else. Plans and prioritizes wisely and with exceptional foresight seeks extra responsibility and takes on the hardest jobs. That's 5.0 here's the, here's the five bullet 0.0 for teamwork. Team builder inspires cooperation and progress, focuses, goals and techniques for teams the best at accepting and offering team direction. That's a team player. That's teamwork. And here's, here's the, here's how you get a 5.0 in leadership. Now think about this. You think you're a good seal, you think you're a good sailor and you think I'm, I'm a good leader, right? Here's what you have to do to get a 5.0 inspiring motivator and trainer. Subordinates reach highest level of growth and development. So now all of a sudden, not even about you anymore. It's about you being a leader and you not just what you do, but what your subordinates, your subordinates have to reach the highest level of growth and development. It goes on. Superb organizer. Great foresight develops process improvements and efficiencies, leadership achievements, Dr. Leadership at treatment, dramatically further command, mission and vision. So what you do as a leader dramatically furthers the mission.

Speaker 3:          00:20:36       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:20:36       Perseveres through the toughest challenges and inspires other others. Exceptional communicator. How many people did you know that are exceptional communicators? There's not a lot of people that are exceptional commuters. That's a hard thing. That's not only being born with some communication skills, it's actively working and honing those skills through your lifetime. Before someone tells you you're an exceptional communicator. Make subordinate safety conscience maintains top safety record constantly improves the personal and professional lives of others. So this is, this is barely even about you anymore. It's how well, how well does your team do? So you've got to be 100% squared away if you're going to get a 5.0 in leadership. That's just the way it is. And, and like I said, you're not just getting judged on your success, but on the success, not just of the mission, but of the actual individual people that work for you.

Speaker 1:          00:21:31       And so this, this granular look at these descriptions kind of changed this guy's perspective and it now he actually saw what he was supposed to be doing and he actually knew what he was aiming at and he didn't know that before. And you know who's fault it is that he didn't know that it's my fault because I'm the guy that's in charge and I thought everyone knew or I thought at least everyone was aiming as high as they possibly good at everything. But that's actually naive. It's naive for a couple reasons. Not only is not everyone aiming to be the best they can, I don't know. Some people don't care about some things, but sometimes people don't actually understand what it is that they're supposed to be aiming at. They don't understand what the metric is, how they're being measured, and clearly you have to have something to aim at and if you don't have anything to aim at, then you're never going to get anywhere. You're never going to be, you're never going to hit the target that's you're not aiming at. You have to aim at the target to hit it. You have to know what you are trying to be or you won't be that. And the navy, I think with this evaluation form

Speaker 1:          00:22:47       does a decent job. If you kind of can take a step back and one problems with the, with the navy evaluation system and all the evaluation systems in the military is they're very administrative. It's, it turns into more much more of a paperwork drill than it is an actual, an actual attempt to make people improve themselves. Right. It's there, but people go all go to FAU. This is where I fell out. Cool. I'm a promotion called man. They don't read it. Yeah, right. They don't actually, it's not, it's not a true counseling up to the objective isn't to really truly improve those people. That's one of the problems with this, with the, with the counseling system inside the navy and it happens in the other branches as well. But, but if you read that sheet and you kind of take a look at it, then you realize, okay, there's some things that I can aim at now. And the navy does a decent job of that. I'll tell you, the Marine Corps does an even better job.

Speaker 1:          00:23:43       The United States Corp evaluation system is more detailed and it's more descriptive and it's more complete. The navy system than the whole navy evaluation is two pages long. The Marine Corps, there's is six pages long. And one thing that's interesting about the marine corps, you know, in, in the navy one they list, okay, you're a 1.0 this is what you're like as a 1.0 the marine corps doesn't even give description for the low end of the spectrum. They did. They don't even, they don't even exist. They're not going to waste time describing a loser marine. They have a higher minimum standard basically. But this is one thing that struck me the first time I kind of noticed the Marine Corp evaluation system cause it's, it's an administrative thing so it's not like I would see it on a regular basis. When I was in Ramadi, I was in the brigade tactical operation center and I was probably there for a meeting with the brigade commander or whatever and was there for whatever reason.

Speaker 1:          00:24:45       And one of the marine officers was in there who I knew and we were kind of talking and he was filling out one of an evaluation for one of his guys and he was on the back page of his evaluation. And I was just being nosy I guess looking at looking at what it was like looking at what their system was like, comparing it to our system. And as I was looking at the form on the last page, the page he was actually working on there, whereas a graphic representation of of marines and of how they rank marines and it kind of looked like a Christmas tree. So if you picture a Christmas tree and the whole Christmas tree is made up of Little Eagle Globe and anchor, which is the symbol of the Marine Corps. And so there's a bunch of Little Eagle Globe and anchors and they're all positioned on this piece of paper and it looks like a Christmas tree.

Speaker 1:          00:25:34       And so the, the bottom, the actually the, the bottom of this graphic, the bottom of this Christmas tree is just an empty space. There's nothing there. And, and that line is representative. There's a little indicator that shows what that line represents. That line represents the unqualified marine. So there should be no unqualified marines in your unit. And then it goes up one level and now you've just got one single Eagle Globe and anchor representing one marine. And, and this, this is, it looks like the trunk of the Christmas tree and that that line is labeled a qualified marine. So now you've got one guy, you know, percentage wise, one person that is simply just a qualified marine there. He's qualified but there's not, this shouldn't be that many of them. And then they'd go, now he picked her Christmas tree above the trunk. Now it's a big wide area and that's where they go to this next level, which has the most, it's like the middle third of the Christmas tree and that area they labeled that area.

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       One of the many highly qualified professionals who form the majority of this grade. So the biggest chunk of people is sort of in the middle third of this Christmas tree. And that's what it is. Hey, that's what most of, that's where most of the guys are. There's Holly highly qualified people. They make up the most of this group of that that I'm evaluating. And there they are. And then above that third on this Christmas tree is a, now the Christmas tree is getting smaller, right? So now we're getting into a narrow group in this narrow group is labeled and it's called Sophie. You're in this group, you're being labeled as one of the few exceptionally qualified marines. And that again, that's a much smaller number than that middle group. And then you get to the top of the Christmas tree where there is a single eagle globe and anchor representing the very best of this group. And it's up there alone at the pinnacle of performance. And there's a label for this singular marine at the top of his group. And the label says the eminently qualified marine. And I remember when I read that,

Speaker 1:          00:28:13       when I read those words, the eminently qualified marine and I, I thought to myself, that is the ultimate praise. And that's pretty much how the Marine Corp evaluation ends. And it ends in this epic way because it is, it is an I, I, it's weird to say this, it's an epic document. It's an epic, epic document. And I want to talk about this document today and I want to start off by, by the way, that the document itself starts off. So this is the Marine Corps fitness report. This is how they grade marines. And it starts off with the commandant's guidance. So the first thing they'd get his guidance from the most senior marine in the Marine Corps and the commandant's guidance says the completed fitness report is the most important information component in manpower management. It is the primary means of evaluating a marine's performance and is the commandant's primary tool for the selection of personnel for promotion, augmentation, resident schooling, command and duty assignments. Therefore, the completion of this report is one of an officer's most critical responsibilities inherent in this duty as the commitment of each reporting senior and reviewing officer to ensure the integrity of the system by giving close attention to accurate marking and timely reporting.

Speaker 1:          00:29:44       Every officer serves a role in the scrupulous maintenance of this evaluation system. Ultimately important to both the individual and the Marine Corps. Inflationary markings only serve to dilute the actual value of each report. Reviewing officers will not concur with inflated reports. So out of the gate we're getting put in check. Do not come here telling everyone they're great. That's not, that's not gonna fly where we're rejecting that outright from the start. Now we start the evaluation and again this is set up a little bit similar to the navy and they start breaking out what your performance is based on the first thing that it's based on his mission, accomplishment and mission accomplishment. They break into two things. The first thing is performance. So here's what it says about performance of mission accomplishment, accomplishment, results achieved during the reporting period, how well those duties inherent to a marine's billet plus all additional duties formally and informally assigned work carried out reflects a marine's aptitude, competence and commitment to the unit success above personal reward indicators, our time and resource management task, prioritization and tenacity to achieve positive ends consistently. So the low end it says meets requirements of billet and additional duties, aptitude, commitment and competence. Meet expectations, results, maintain status quo so that as you're doing your job,

Speaker 2:          00:31:31       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:32       And then if you're at the high end of the spectrum, results far surpass expectations, recognizes and exploits new resources creates opportunities, emulated, sought after as an expert with influence beyond unit impact, significant innovative approaches to problems produce significant gains in quality and efficiency. If you just take that single bullet and that's what you try and achieve, you're smoking, you're crushing you. I want to, you have someone like that working for you and you're in heaven because this guy is going to make things happen. Next up. Proficiency demonstrates technical knowledge and practical skill and the execution of the marines. Overall duties combines training, education and experience translates skills into actions which contribute to accomplishing tasks and missions imparts knowledge to others.

Speaker 1:          00:32:34       Think about this one translates skills and actions. That's it. That's kind of a big deal. How many people have skills, but they can't translate them in actions? Thinking about that your life. Hey, you got some skills, but you don't use them. You can't put them anywhere. You can't put them into a fact. Here's the middle grade for proficiency. Demonstrates mastery of all required skills. So if you've mastered your skills, you're still just like in the middle. Expertise, education, and experience consistently enhance mission, accomplishment, innovative troubleshooter and problem solver effectively impart skills to subordinates. These are the kinds of things where if you load that you're supposed to impart skills to your subordinates. You pay attention to it, you start doing it, but you might not recognize that that's part of your job. That's part of your life. Here's what it sounds like if you're an expert. True expert in field knowledge and skills impact far beyond those of peers, translates broad based education and experience into forward thinking. Innovative actions make a measurable impact on mission accomplishment. Peerless teacher selflessly imparts expertise to subordinates, peers, and seniors. Think about that. That is a high bar man. That is a high bar. You could work, you could work diligently every single day and fall short of that. Yeah, but let me tell you, it's important that you know that you should be working towards it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:34:04       Next section. Individual character. Isn't it legit? When you're going to grade someone on their character, this is outstanding. This is outstanding. How many people are not thinking about what their character is, how many people are not actively minding the way that their actions reflect their character happens all the time. Oh yeah. If we were thinking about if you knew you're getting graded on it, maybe you wouldn't take those, those base actions. Yeah. Yeah. Kind of like goes along with like how you said that one time, like imagine someone's videotaping, you know, and they're going to do the playback. It's like, man, if you go, if you have that in the back of your mind yet you act. That's the first step though, because the actual, that's the first step because you might think, well, I'm being videoed but this is what I'm expected to do. So you might be doing something that's not correct. You might be off chart. You might be aiming at the wrong thing. Hey, I'm acting like a tough guy. I want everyone to know that I'm tough. You realize, oh, that's actually stupid. Yeah. So you can be, you can have in your mind that I'm going to keep my character, but you're wrong because you might be aiming at the wrong thing. So this gives you some pretty specific things to aim at.

Speaker 1:          00:35:16       Topic number one, core courage, moral or physical strength to overcome danger, fear, difficulty or anxiety. Personal acceptance of responsibility and accountability. Placing conscience over competing interests regardless of consequences.

Speaker 2:          00:35:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:35       Conscious, overriding decision, risk, bodily harm or death to accomplish the mission or save others, the will to persevere despite uncertainty. What if you're thinking about the fact that you're getting graded on your will to persevere despite uncertainty? You think about that every day. You don't know what your future holds, but you're going to persevere regardless. Think if you're getting graded on that every day. Hmm. Here's what the bottom end of the spectrum is. Demonstrates inner strength. So at the minimum, you're demonstrating inner strength and acceptance of responsibility commensurate with the scope of duties and experience, willing to face moral of physical danger in pursuit of mission accomplishment. So even at the low end of the spectrum, you're still willing to face danger. Moral or physical challenges.

Speaker 1:          00:36:30       Here's the middle. Guided by conscious in all actions, proven ability, proven ability to overcome danger, fear, difficulty or anxiety exhibits bravery in the face of adversity and certainty, not deterred by moral difficult situations, morally difficult situations or has miss responsibilities. How often are people deterred by difficult situations, daily, morally, morally difficult situations? Here's at the top, the top of the spectrum for courage, uncommon bravery and capacity to overcome obstacles and inspire others in the face of moral dilemma or life threatening danger but not. It's not even just about you. You have to actually take it to level. We're inspiring others demonstrated under the most adverse conditions. Selfless always places conscience over competing interest regardless of physical or personal consequences. That's a competition. We talked about the competition between, oh, I'm going to take care of myself and I'm going to take care of the team. I'm going to take care of the mission between what's doing what's right to do instead of what is easy to do. The next section that you get graded on your individual character is effectiveness under stress.

Speaker 1:          00:37:57       This is just outstanding because there's not thinking about this and you don't even see this in in business. I don't see this and when people evaluate other in the business world, but there is stress in business world is a different kind of stress, but it's stress. Here's effectiveness under stress. Here's what you're doing. Thinking, functioning and leading effectively under conditions of physical and or mental pressure. Maintaining composure appropriate for the situation while displaying steady purpose of action, enabling one to inspire others while continuing to lead under adverse conditions. Physical and emotional strength. Resilience and endurance are elements. Low End of the spectrum. Exhibits discipline and stability under pressure, judgment and effective problem solving skills are evident. Just the low end of the spectrum. By the way, how many people do you think, do you know that don't exhibit any discipline or stability under pressure, right?

Speaker 1:          00:38:52       There's all kinds of people. Yeah, there's all kinds of people and we know when's the last time you you, you didn't do a good job under pressure? Probably this morning. It happens, right? Fully write comments, especially when you're not thinking about it, especially when you're not aimed at the correct response to pressure. Yeah. Especially when you haven't put a standard in your mind. Remember when you used to kind of freak out in Jujitsu when you got claustrophobic, right? Sure. Yeah. Right? Sure. You get, you'd get in a position. Yes, sir. Yeah. Usually side control. Right. You didn't like that. The pressure on the neck, the pressure on the chest. There were more circumstances surrounding those, you know, scenario. Does she has a mental and moral problems? Yeah, it would have to. Yeah. Okay. Yes, I do remember that. At some point you said to yourself, all right, I cannot act that way anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:39:47       Yeah. You made a, you set a bar for yourself. Yes, sir. That's the beginning of solving the problem. That's what I love about this. It's actually setting a bar of when you're under stress, this is how you got to act if you're, if you're a little above average for effectiveness under stress, here's where you're at. Consistently demonstrates maturity, mental agility and willpower during periods of adversity provides order to chaos through the application of intuition, problem solving skills and leadership. Composure reassures other, imagine you are on a team and this is the average guy. This is just so impressive. But my point is unless you tell your guys what average is, they won't know it. Yeah, they don't understand it.

Speaker 1:          00:40:41       Here's the high end. So this is when you look at your troops and you say, this is what I want you to do. When we come under massive amounts of stress. Here's the model I want you to try and perform as demonstrates. Sell the matched presence of mind under the most demanding circumstances stabilizes any situation through the resolute and timely application of direction, focus and personal presence. Now, what I was doing this, I was actually only gonna read the high end when I was thinking about this, but then I realized each one of these built and that person at the high end already has the other two. But there's other elements in there that aren't mentioned in the high end. So you've got to mention me and you assume when someone's on the high end, they got those. Obviously they got the lower end things wrapped up, right? So you got to combine all these three together, the low grade, the middle grade in the high grade.

Speaker 4:          00:41:36       We want people to show initiative. Talk about this all the time. This is the essence of decentralized command, is that people show initiative. Here's what they say about initiative action in the absence of specific direction, seeing what needs to be done and acting without prompting. Hmm. So I'm listening to all, all of these, this whole thing. And at first I was like, oh, that's cool. That's how the navy kind of evaluate the people and sure you're going to talk about the marines and stuff, but maybe like the second little part you started reading, I just started applying it to myself. That's what I'm saying, like my life. Okay. So you know, we're, we're all part of that. Like, if you have a family, if you're at the dad or something, right, or your whatever, if you, if you're in a family unit, you're part of a team right there.

Speaker 4:          00:42:23       And you know your goals change from time to time, but you sorta know the goals. So I'm like thinking in my mind every little like element that you're talking about, I'm like, okay, let me evaluate myself for sure with this. Like how good and you're right, man. So a lot of times, a lot of times like, okay, so performing under under stress, right? Like there's all these little things. You're going to the beach and you're trying to make it on the house and make it the beach. We have a high stress level. The kids need their water and they need their change of clothes. It might get cold, they need to Jackie and all this stuff. Meanwhile the clock is ticking, you know, daylight. You could go on and miss sunset, all the stuff. Um, so how are you going to perform under that stress?

Speaker 4:          00:43:09       You know, and I get it. The funny thing is you're, you're bringing up this, you're bringing up this, and I'm actually completely making fun of you for bringing up that stress. How often are you at a public place and you see a family and they're running late or whatever, and you see a leader of the family, mother or father freaking out and losing their composure over the stress that we were actually joking about. Yeah, you're a little bit serious. I'm joking about it. But still you see people lose their minds because of dumb things. Oh yeah. And it, there's a little bit of stress in their world and they dropped the ball. They freak out. Farm. Exactly. So my question is, do those people, has anyone ever sat them down and explain to them what the standard is? Yes sir. And that's my point here.

Speaker 4:          00:43:54       Yeah. A lot of times people don't even recognize, they don't even know. They don't even understand what, what the eminently qualified human being, how they are going to act in these situations. Yeah. It totally, totally, exactly 100% right there. So like, okay, so you know how he ever have a guy who like loses his temper and then like you say, hey, you kind of lost it there and then he goes back to how he felt like almost like the way he felt justified. Right. So you just understand, here's the thing Brad, we know you felt like that. You totally demonstrates. So you don't have to explain that. But yeah, you were feeling

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       this and you behaved a certain way. But if that guy knew that he was being evaluated on his behavior, regardless of how he feels, but he, he'd be aiming how you put and that's it. It's not, it's not just the grading part. Yes, it's, you have to know what the standard is because that guy that might not even understand, hey, if I lose my temper, it's, I think it was either, I think it was JP. Jp really took it to heart when he heard me say losing your temper is a weakness. The for that. He just didn't, you know, because you see other people in your life and see other team guys, you see your dad, you see your uncle and they fly off the handle and you almost have a respect for it, right? You definitely respect your, when your dad loses your temporary, you kind of think, wow, that's powerful.

Speaker 1:          00:45:21       How can I have some of that power? While you just do that, it's a learned mechanism. And then eventually you realize or someone tells you, Hey, when you lose your temper, you're not in control. And matter of fact, you're not controlling all and whatever made you lose your temper is controlling you. And losing your temper is, is a weakness. And so that's the big difference. It's not just, hey, you're being graded, you're being watched, which is definitely a great mindset to have, but you have to understand what the parameters are that you're being measured by, that you're being graded on. And that's where this comes into play. The next section, I'd just started with initiative and we want subordinates to take initiative, but we want everyone to take initiative, right? Or your kids. You want your kids to take initiative. You want people in your, if you want to, everyone to take initiative.

Speaker 1:          00:46:10       I used to say to the young seal platoon commanders and tasking your cleaners, I would say imagine if everyone of your, everyone, your fire team leaders just was doing something smart. They just took initiative and made it happen. Your job becomes so easy because you don't have to control everything. Everyone's just making things happen. That's initiative. So here's what it says about initiative action in the absence of specific direction, seeing what needs to be done and acting without prompting the instinct to begin a task and follow through energetically on one's own accord, being creative, proactive, and decisive, transforming opportunity into action. So that's what initiatives, if you're on the low end, you demonstrate willingness to take action in the absence of absence of specific direction, acts commensurate with grade training and experience. That's what we expect of you. Little bit, little bit better in the middle, self motivated, an action oriented foresight and energy consistently transform opportunity into action. Develops and pursues creative initiative solutions or sorry, innovative solutions acts without prompting. Self starter. That's what we want. And then here we go. The high end, highly motivated and proactive displays, exceptional awareness of surroundings and environment. Uncanny ability to anticipate mission requirements and quickly formulate original far reaching solutions

Speaker 1:          00:47:41       always takes decisive, effective action with definitions like that, it's no wonder there's only been one marina at the top of that Christmas tree because that is a squared away individual right there. Far region. Know what's crazy about this? Having put so many people through training myself, even though there's only one allotted space up there, there are so many people that are capable of this kind of behavior. It's way more than 1% it's way more than 10% if you have people that understand what the parameters are and really aim towards, you can get a lot closer than most people would think. Yeah, and I, I mean I obviously, I don't know, but it seems like what you, what you're talking about, if they, like a lot of people just don't know the standard and the, you know, they don't know. Yeah, they don't know. It's not been made clear to them. The next section, leadership, and this is broken into multiple sections obviously, because leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield. So this is their biggest section. Leadership section number one, leading subordinates. The inseparable relationship between leader and lead, the application of leadership principles to provide direction and motivate subordinates using authority, persuasion and personality to influence subordinates to accomplish assigned tasks, sustaining motivation and morale while maximizing subordinates performance. So there you go. That's what you're going to do as a leader. Low End

Speaker 1:          00:49:13       engaged provides instructions and directs. Execution seeks to accomplish mission in ways that sustain motivation and morale actions contribute to unit effectiveness. Cool. So you're acceptable. Yeah. Middle Ground.

Speaker 2:          00:49:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:29       Achieves a highly effective balance between direction and delegation. We're talking a little dichotomy. Effectively. Task subordinates and clearly delineates extent. Standards, expected enhances performance through constructive supervision, fosters motivation, enhances morale, builds and sustains teams that successfully meet mission requirements, encourages initiative and candor among subordinates. So you can see that the, the low end, you're kind of just telling people what to do a little bit right.

Speaker 2:          00:50:04       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:50:06       Now you're starting to ask for feedback. You're starting to build that bond. Here's the high end number one thing for the high end promotes creativity and energy among subordinates by striking it. The ideal balance of direction and delegation achieves highest of performance from subordinates by encouraging individual initiative. That's decentralized command. I'm going to let you guys run and that's going to maximize performance. This is an incredible term in genders, willing subordination, loyalty and trust that allows subordinates to overcome their perceived limitations. Willing subordination when your team actually wants to follow you. Personal leadership fosters highest level of motivation and morale, ensuring mission accomplishment even in the most difficult circumstances. Next section, developing subordinates, commitment to train, educate and challenge all marines regardless of race, religion, ethnic background or gender mentorship, cultivating professional and PR and personal development of subordinates, developing team players in a spree decor, ability to combine teaching and coaching, creating an atmosphere, tolerant of mistakes in the course of learning. You'll hear, you'll think about that very often in the marine corps. Hey, we're tolerant of mistakes. That's how you learn. Low End of the spectrum maintains an environment that allows personal professional development and sure his subordinates participate in all mandated development programs.

Speaker 1:          00:51:48       Ground develops an institutes, innovative programs. It's you're proactively trying to bring up and raise your subordinates, make them better to include PMA, which is professional military education that emphasize personal and professional development of subordinates challenges, subordinates to exceed their perceived potential, thereby enhancing unit morale and effectiveness creates an environment where all marines are competent to learn through trial and error as a mentor. Prepare subordinates for increased responsibility and duties. By the way, this is the number two item under leadership. The first one is leading, the second one is developing your subordinates. Here's the top end of the spectrum. Widely recognized and emulated as a teacher, coach and leader. Any marine would desire to serve with this marine because they know they will grow personally and professionally. Subordinate and unit performance far surpasses expected results due to mentorship and team building talents. Attitude toward subordinate development is infectious, extending beyond the unit that that's bold. Now you are training your people so well that other people in other units are starting to train their people. Think about that impact right there. That's how you develop. You develop your subordinates so much that some other leader in a different company, in a different platoon, in a different battalion says we're going to start following that program. Going to start it up. Yeah, that's leadership right there.

Speaker 1:          00:53:31       Section number three is setting the example the most visible facet of leadership. How well a marine serves as a role model for all others. Personal action demonstrates the highest standards of conduct, ethical behavior, fitness and appearance bearing demeanor and self discipline are elements. Low end maintains Marie corn standards for appearance, weight and uniform where sustains required level of physical fitness and ears to the tenants of the Marine Corps. Values fine. You're accepted. Middle-Grade personal conduct on and off duty reflects highest marine core standards of integrity bearing and appearance. Character is exceptional. Actively seek self improvement in wide ranging areas. Dedication to duty and professional example. Encourage others. Self improvement efforts. That's the middle grade them. In the middle grade, you reflect the highest marine core standards of integrity bearing in appearance. You know what that means? That means 24 hours a day you're in the game. That's what that means. It means you're active, actively seeking self improvement in wide ranging areas. You're trying to get better everywhere. That's middle ground by the way. High Ground Model Marine frequently emulated exemplary conduct. Behavior and actions are tones. Setting an inspiration to subordinates, peers and seniors. Remarkable dedication to improving self and others.

Speaker 1:          00:55:21       What are you trying to do to get better? For me, as I say that said that on this podcast since day one we're trying to get better. What are you doing actually? Yeah. What's, what's the activity? Because if you knew another word you see here a lot and this is action, action, action words into action, ideas and actions. Skills into action. Hmm. I was going back and forth with a guy that I did some work with, four echelon front, and I worked with him quite a few years ago overseas, and we still text back and forth from time to time, and he, I said, hey, because he was telling me some of the notes he had taken it. I said, send me some of the notes. One of the notes that he's from, the first note he sent me was, you can't think things better. No, it's, it's, it's a solid piece of advice because he's one of these guys that that was a thinker, right? Yeah. The big thinker, and I'm all about thinking, you know, let's, let's develop our brain. Let's develop our mind power. Let's think about things. Let's be thoughtful. That's fine, but you can't think things better. They're not going to get better unless you actually apply the skills, skills into action. Fobts into action.

Speaker 1:          00:56:48       Next, ensuring wellbeing of subordinates. The genuine interest in the wellbeing of marines enhances subordinates ability to concentrate. Focus on mission accomplishment. Concern for family readiness is inherent. The importance placed on welfare of subordinates is based on the belief that marines take care of their own low end of the spectrum deals confidently with issues pertinent to subordinate welfare and recognize a suitable courses of action that supports subordinates. Wellbeing applies available resources, allowing subordinates to effectively concentrate on the mission. At a minimum, you're absolutely taken care of your people. Middle grade instills and or reinforces a sense of responsibility among junior marines for themselves and their subordinates actively fosters the development of and uses support system search for subordinates which improved their ability to contribute to unit mission accomplishment efforts to enhance subordinate welfare, improve the units ability to accomplish their mission. People don't think about that fact that the people that are actually accomplishing the mission, our people, and if those people aren't ready to perform because you've neglected them, you're not going to be to accomplish the mission. High grade noticeably enhances subordinates wellbeing, resulting in measurable increase in unit effectiveness, maximizes unit and base resources to provide subordinates with the best support available. Proactive approach serves to energize unit members to take care of their own,

Speaker 1:          00:58:26       thereby correcting potential problems before they can hinder subordinates effectiveness. Widely recognized for techniques and policies that produce results and build morale, builds strong family atmosphere, puts motto, mission first, Marines always into action.

Speaker 2:          00:58:46       Boom.

Speaker 1:          00:58:49       Last section for leadership communication skills, the efficient transmission and receipt of thoughts and ideas that enable and enhance leadership. Equal importance given to listening, speaking, writing and critical reading skills. Interactive, allowing one to perceive problems and situations. Provide concise guidance and expects xpress complex ideas in a form easily understood by allows subordinates to ask questions, raise issues and concerns and venture opinions contributes to a leader's ability to motivate as well as council. Minimum skilled and receiving and conveying information communicates effectively in performance of duties. That's the minimum above average middle grade. Clearly articulate thoughts and ideas verbally and in writing. Let's think about that middle ground. Do you know how hard it is for people to clearly articulate faults and ideas verbally and in writing? It is a skill you need to work on all the time. By the way. This gets you a middle grade here. Communication in all forms is accurate, intelligent, concise and timely. Those standards accurate, intelligent, concise and timely communicates with clarity and verve. Ensuring understanding of intent or purpose encourages and considers the contributions of others high grade. Here we go. Highly developed facility in verbal communication, adept in composing written documents of the highest quality combines presence and verbal skills which indent in gender confidence and achieve understanding irrespective of setting situation or size of group addressed displays. An intuitive sense of when and how to listen,

Speaker 1:          01:01:21       so,

Speaker 2:          01:01:23       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:01:24       read, write, speak, listen and do it all the time. If you're in a leadership position or you want to be in one.

Speaker 2:          01:01:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:34       The the reading part, people ask me what I learned in college. One of the most important things that I learned in college was I was an English major. This is why I was an English major by the way, because I recognized when I was at a seal team, as a young officer that one of the most important things I was going to be dealing with was communicating with other humans. And I needed to have good command of the English language and of reading and writing the English language. But when I had to decipher Shakespeare and I took a lot of Shakespeare and you realize that you don't know what words mean and you realize that you don't understand the sentence construction and you, what you realize is that you have to break them down and go them and figure it out. So when I would get the rules of engagement from up the chain of command five years later, and I didn't understand them because they were using words I didn't know, I said, okay, what I needed to do is look these up, read it, find out some substitute words, make sense of it, look up the definition of what they're specifically talking about and go from there.

Speaker 1:          01:02:38       Because when you first, if you just open up Shakespeare and you don't understand something, what do you do? You say it's stupid. When somebody writes a rules of engagement and there's words in there you don't understand. If you don't understand how to parse things apart and look up definitions and can't be humble enough to recognize that there's some things that you don't know well then all you do is go all this is stupid.

Speaker 2:          01:03:00       Check communications.

Speaker 1:          01:03:06       The next thing, no one really probably thinks that this is going to be in here for the Marine Corps. The next section you're getting graded on as graded on as a marine. His intellect and wisdom.

Speaker 2:          01:03:20       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:03:21       thanks to people in the military is a bunch of knuckle draggers. Think it's all about brand,

Speaker 2:          01:03:28       but there you go.

Speaker 1:          01:03:30       Intellect and wisdom, intellect and wisdom, professional, military education. PME, committed to intellectual growth in ways beneficial to the Marine Corps. Increases breadth and depth of war fighting and leadership aptitude. Resources include residents, schools, professional qualifications and certification processes, nonresident and other extension courses. Civilian educational institutional coursework. A personal reading program that includes but is not limited to selections from the commandant's reading list, participation in discussion groups and military societies and involvement in learning through new technologies.

Speaker 2:          01:04:15       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:04:15       you got to get in the game, right? They're going to get educated. Here's low end maintains currency and required military skills and related developments has completed or is enrolled. Inappropriate level of PME for grade and level of experience. Recognizes and understands new and creative approaches to service issues. Remains abreast of contemporary concepts and issues.

Speaker 2:          01:04:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04:42       Middle-Grade PME outlook expense expands beyond Mos and required education. So you're not even worry about your own job. You've got that covered. Now you're going outside of what your job is, develops and follows a comprehensive personal program which includes broadened professional reading and or academic coursework, advances new concepts and ideas. And here's your high end dedicated to lifelong learning as a result of active and continuous efforts, widely recognized as an intellectual leader in professionally related topics, makes time for study and takes advantage of all resources and programs, introduces new and creative approaches to service issues, engages in a broad spectrum of forums and dialogues. So this is never going to stop. You've got to keep feeding your brain.

Speaker 1:          01:05:39       The next thing you're getting graded on. Intellect and wisdom, decision making, ability, viable and timely problems, solution, contributing elements. Our judgment and decisiveness decisions reflect the balance between an optimal solution and a satisfactory workable solution that generates tempo. So there's a good dichotomy for you. Optimal decision on on one side, workable decision that can keep you moving. On the other side, you've got to balance that dichotomy. Decisions are made within the context of the commanders established intent and the goal of mission accomplishment. So of course you're trying to support the commander's intent. Anticipation, mental agility, intuition and success are inherent. This is not the first time they brought up intuition in here. How you develop into intuition, experience, wisdom, breeding, low end, low end makes sound decisions leading to mission accomplishment as the minimum. The minimum was to make sound decisions actively collects and evaluates information that ways alternative alternatives to achieve timely results, confidently approaches problems, accepts responsibility for outcomes. Middle-Grade demonstrates mental agility.

Speaker 2:          01:06:59       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:07:00       effectively prioritizes and solves multiple complex problems. This prioritize and execute analytical abilities enhanced by experience, education, and intuition, anticipates problems and into implements viable longterm solutions, solutions, steadfast, willing to make difficult decisions. That's a, that's a high bar for middle grade, high grade, widely recognized and sought after to resolve the most critical, complex problems. Seldom matched analytical and intuitive abilities. Accurately foresees unexpected problems and arrives at wealthtime decisions despite fog and friction, completely confident approach to all problems masterfully strikes a balance between the desire for perfect knowledge and greater tempo, widely recognized to solve problems. This one though, this little line here, accurately foresees unexpected problems and arrives at wealthtime decisions despite fog and friction as a big ask right there, you gotta be in the game, you gotta be in the game to get to that level. Last thing you're getting great on, on for intellect and wisdom, his judgment, the discretionary aspect of decision making draws and core values, knowledge and personal experience to make wise choices.

Speaker 3:          01:08:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:41       Comprehends the consequences of contemplated courses of action.

Speaker 3:          01:08:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:48       Minimum Grade Majority of judgments are measured, circumspect, relevant and correct. Minimum middle-grade decisions are constant, our scar consistent and uniformly correct. Tempered by consideration of their consequences. Able to identify, isolate, and assess relevant factors in the decision making process. Opinion sought by others, subordinates personally, personal interest in favor of impartiality.

Speaker 3:          01:09:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:21       And the high end decisions reflect exceptional, exceptional insight and wisdom. Beyond this marine's experience, counsel sought by all often an arbiter consistent superior judgement inspires the confidence of seniors.

Speaker 1:          01:09:42       So that's how you get graded on intellect and wisdom. And actually the last thing that they grade you on is they actually grade you on how well you evaluate your other marines. The extent to which this officer serving as a reported official conducted or required others to conduct accurate uninflated and timely evaluations. This is the last thing you get great at all and they go through and you're, the low end is like you did a good job. The high end is you do an outstanding job, but they're grading you on how well you grade. And then you get to the last page, which is where this is where you have the Christmas tree, the Eagle Globe and anchor Christmas tree comparative assessment provide a comparative assessment of potential by placing an x in the appropriate box in marking the comparison, consider all the marines have this grade whose professional abilities are known to you personally. And then you go through that tree, the unqualified on satisfactory, a qualified marine, one of the many highly qualified professionals who formed the majority of this grade, one of the few exceptionally qualified marines. And then you get to the top, the singular marine at the top who is the eminently qualified marine,

Speaker 1:          01:11:07       the eminently qualified marine. And that's what I think makes this, makes this interesting, is to to consider that statement imminently qualified and think about where you're at and you're, you're not at the top. I'm out of the top. None of us are at the top who can be, but what are we striving to be? What are we striving to be? Are we striving to be the most eminently qualified human being that we can be? Do you even know what that means? Do you even have those thoughts in your head? I'm guessing you don't. I barely do. I know I've had vague thoughts. I know I had definitions that floated around in my head of what I was trying to be, what I'm trying to be today, but why aren't those solid?

Speaker 2:          01:12:28       Why aren't they?

Speaker 1:          01:12:29       I was, I was thinking about this. I was talking to Dave Burke deal Tafe. Yeah, good deal, Dave. And I was like, Hey, we need to build this. You're basically an evaluation system for humans to become eminently qualified as a human. What does that look like? Not only to graved yourself, but to actually know what you are trying to be. So Dave and I will work on that. So stand by to get some and until, until we do get that out, then think about, think about are there areas that, you know what the goal is that you're walking around thinking that you deserve a 5.0

Speaker 1:          01:13:31       but you really actually, he really actually deserve to. I know I do that. Yes. Right? I'm thinking I'm good. I'm walking around. I'm thinking I'm running everything right. I'm thinking, I'm thinking I'd come correct. Yes. But the reality is I don't, you know, and, and the reality is that you have that little moving goalpost in your head. You move it around a little bit, right? You give yourself a little bit more slack one day, then you tighten it up cause you're feeling good the next day, then you slack it off a little bit more. But I think as far as you're concerned, that's a five. Oh, right. You're there. You're in there. And the reality is, I don't measure up the way I should be measuring up on a daily basis.

Speaker 2:          01:14:14       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:14:15       On an hourly basis. Who's grading me? Who's lagging to me? You know, who is me? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:14:25       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:14:26       me. But until we clarify what the aim is, what the goal is and what those standards are, how am I supposed to hold myself accountable to those standards when they don't even exist? So I'm going to make them exist. Yeah. I'm going to put them in. I'm going to put them on paper. We're going to come up with that eminently qualified human being. What that looks like because we all got all got ideas floating around up there.

Speaker 2:          01:14:48       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:14:50       Well I'm going to bring it, bring it. I'm going to apply that. Put it into action. Put it into action. Right. Are we doing everything that we could be doing? Everything that we should be doing? Are we cutting corners? Are we slacking off? We'd given ourselves a 5.0 when we should be at best. Cracking a too daily. How much are we leaving on the table every day? That's a question for you, right? How much are we leaving on the table? How much you say, Nah, you know what? I can just leave that there. It's fine. How much? How many things just do you accept this collateral damage? Like something goes wrong, like one thing goes wrong and so there's just collateral damage. Other things are just gonna fall by the way. And you're good with it. Yeah, you're good with it. You, you, you know you, I hurt my knee. Oh, cool. Guess what? I'm gonna eat a donut, right? Is that where we're at? Is that where we're at or is there collateral damage? Oh, work was hard. Therefore I'm going to know, treat my family, not going to, not going to have good family quality time tonight. Collateral damage because they what to expect from me. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:16:01       Right? Where's the collateral damage? Why are we allowing this collateral damage will, part of the reason I'm telling you that we allow this collateral damage just cause we're not effectively grading ourselves. And even worse than that, we don't even know what standard we're trying to achieve. No one's even told us the minimum standard. Okay, so why is your life going marginal right now? Why are you doing okay? Why am I doing okay right now? Well, it's because I have some vague idea. I have, I, I kind of know I'm heading in the right general direction. That's not good enough to get maximum. It's not good enough to be eminently qualified. It does. It doesn't work. You have to step it up.

Speaker 2:          01:16:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:16:47       You have to, you have to have the unmitigated daily discipline in all things and that's hard. It's hard for one day. Never mind every single day. So I'm going to make this evaluation. Dave and I are going to make it. I'll get it out to y'all and until then, and I'll try and get it turned around as quick as possible. At least some kind of a,

Speaker 3:          01:17:15       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:17:15       What is it called? An early version. A Beta test? Is that what it's called? Uh, sure. I think, no, the technology. Right, right, right, right. Yeah, sure. Beta test. We'll get a Beta test. We're trying to get something out there quick and until then start looking at yourself as usual, your strengths, your weaknesses, and start trying to see where you can improve.

Speaker 3:          01:17:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:17:39       Start moving towards the goal of becoming the eminently qualified human beings where we're heading. And I think that is all I've got for tonight. So Echo Charles, what do you got? Well

Speaker 4:          01:17:59       I got, I know, I know. We're trying to step up. Yup. We got thoughts. Well yeah. So you, and you actually mentioned it in like bright there at the end. There were all these Little Eva oh that little bit. All these evaluations are like, you know, you do this consistently and all this stuff. It's so there's two kind of parts to that one. I was thinking you, you have to do all these good things, right? To be the minimum or to be the, you know, you, you can't even really be in the group if you're not in the minimum. Right. But you got to do those things every day. Like you have to essentially be known for these things. Yeah. So, so how we get jammed up, I think when we do, when we are conscious of like how good am I doing in Xyz area of my life or whatever, and if it's something that you're working on, a lot of times we don't get the accurate evaluation to ourselves because we'll do, we'll do it really good one day and we'll do a really good two days.

Speaker 4:          01:18:50       And I'm like, Dang, I'm pretty good at this, so I'm going to go ahead and get myself for like a four or whatever. But meanwhile you only did it twice, meaning, you know, in the whole week you did it twice. You're so happy because it's this big change because you usually do it zero times. Yeah. So you're like, hey, I got this. Your minimum bar was set so low that you think you're crushing it. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Good Times a near miss because in your mind you kind of are comparatively speaking, heritable thing. Is it like if you have a standard and stuff, then you can act more accurately, but we don't have standard. So in your mind it feels like, oh, I got this, I got it licked. I'm, I'm, I'm a four now. You know, I used to be a one, I'm a fort now. So meanwhile you're not a four year actually still a one. Yeah. Really, really? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:19:30       You think you're, you're, and there's also, there's also this, there's also an a, and I, I talked to Dave about this a little bit. There's a, there's a short term grade and there's a longterm grade, because check this out. Let's say you, let's say you've never worked out before and you've been watching video games and eating donuts and, and just, you know, in, in bad physical shape. Yeah. Your grade, your overall grade for physical fitness is whatever. It's a 1.0 it's a low, it's the lowest it can go. But daily if you get up, okay, look, look, I can only run one mile and it's going to take me 20 minutes, 22 minutes, I'm going to do it. And then I'm going to do as many pushups as I can, which is 23. By the way, if I did a one mile run in 22 minutes and did 23 pushups, that would, I would get a 1.0 for the day.

Speaker 1:          01:20:25       Yeah. But this individual that's been on the couch, the living a sedentary lifestyle, if he does that, guess what? He's going to get him. He's going to get a high grades going to get a 4.8 for the day. Hmm. So then he's leaving himself in the right direction. Yeah. So not only is that, not only do you have to, this is one of the problems in it. And again, this is something I told Dave, I'm like, listen, uh, once, uh, by annual twice a year, every six months you're getting a grade that doesn't help you. What you need to look at yourself every day. You need to look at yourself every day and say, did I truly do live this way, live the way I should be living today? Yeah. And then those standards need to be clear and then you need to apply them to your life. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:21:17       I might even say like the, the, the, that that example you just gave. So the guy who was sitting on the couch all the time whenever or every day and now he's doing it. He's working out every day, but his physical fitness standard technically is still low. Still be at a 1.0 maybe another area of evaluation is like, you know, improvement or are you know to say or back when you're young, you know, they give you that most improved kind of thing. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:21:44       Maybe that could be part of it. I think it will be covered by the daily track, the daily track, like, okay, you got to, you got a 4.0 today. What's your average right now? My average for the last, my running average for 30 days is I'm hitting a 3.9 physical fitness. That means I'm doing something every day. I'm pushing the envelope, I'm improving. Now my overall score is moved from a one to a 1.2 yeah. Cause I'm, I'm in a little bit better shape, but it's still not where it needs to be. But guess what? That can crush them people. Right? If someone goes to a 1.2 I'm never going to improve it. So it's been three months. No guess what would you get today? What'd you do today? Same thing. Opposite, right? The opposite can happen where someone thinks, well, I did something, I did something today, so I'm good man. No, no. And the other collateral damages, I did good physical fitness today, so I'm going to take tomorrow off or I'm going to eat a, you know, a crappy meal. Yeah. We get that pizza together. Right? We don't want that. We, and when I say we, I mean me. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:22:49       In that, why is that? Because we've, we've, we've created this, this, this pliable standard in our head that we move around based on our little feelings. You, but, but this does, this won't allow for it. You need to keep yourself in check. You need to keep yourself in check at all times. And the reason you need to keep your check self in check at all times, you need to impose discipline on your life because you will end up in a better situation that you will end up in a better situation. You'll end up with more freedom is where you're gonna end up. You know, people, you talk about regret, right? Oh, you go talk to people when they're, when they're dying on their death bed and they're, they're going to regret things they didn't do. There's nothing I can imagine you're going to regret more than when you look back at your life.

Speaker 1:          01:23:42       And you said, and I didn't achieve what I could have achieved. Yeah. And there's only one way to maximize your achievement. And that's to get daily discipline, daily discipline. And again, when we're talking about achievement, what are we talking about? I'm not just talking about I worked more than you. I made more money than you. I produced more, I sold more cars and that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about what, what is your, what is your achievement? Yeah. What is it you're trying to do? I spent a bunch of time with my family and raised great kids. Okay. That's what you want to do. Put that on paper so you know what that looks like. Maybe there is a financial there. It should be a financial aspect to it because you need to pay, you need to have a roof over your head.

Speaker 1:          01:24:25       You need to be able to feed your kids. So you certainly should have a job of vocation aspect to grading yourself. Are you doing what you should be doing that work? Because if you're working hard at work, guess what? You're going to get promoted eventually. Are you going to find it? You're going to improve your skills to a point where you're be more valuable and you can go find a different job somewhere else. So that's gotta be in there because if what we allow ourselves to do is show up at work every day and just do what we need to do to get by. Guess what? You're never leaving that job. You'd be doing that thing forever. So it's physical fitness. It's what you're eating, your fuel systems that you're putting into your body. It's the family, the the, the effort. What are you doing to improve the skill sets of your children?

Speaker 1:          01:25:13       What are you doing? What are you doing to improve the skill sets of your children? Are you spending 20 minutes teaching them new vocabulary words so that they can articulate better so they can become a better leader when they get older? Are you doing that? Is that a big ask as a dad, as a mom, are you doing, have you showed them how to escape a Dia Tiene? Have you? Maybe you should because you can get caught. Negi team. That's the street fight right street by gay teens are coming. So have you, does your kid know how to escape of Guillotine in a street fight? How much is it? How long will it take? You got to teach him today. That takes 15 minutes, but you've got to drill it. Got To drill it every day until they kind of understand it. So what have you invested in your kids today? What's the minimum standard now you could think to yourself, well, you know, I got my kid an iPad for Christmas. That was an awesome gift. So I'm pretty much good to go as a dad. Right? Does your kid care about that iPad compared to, are you fast forward three years where your kid's got an incredible vocabulary and can defend gay teens? Right? So how much have you invested in your family?

Speaker 2:          01:26:36       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:26:37       so these are the kinds of things that we can set a moving goalpost where you can set a moving goalpost that says, I buy, Hey, if you get your kid an iPad with some apps on it, you're a good dad. That's a moving goalpost. Hey, you should, hey, if you can get your kid an iPad and they can get some educational stuff, you feel pretty good about it. Cool. Good job. Is that a moving goalpost? Yes, it is. Because what they really need to know is have a better vocabulary. What they really need is interaction with you as a human being so that they can interact with other human beings in a, in a more complete way. That's what we're doing. So you got your physical, you got your okay mental, what are you, how much have you read today? And I'm not talking about reading somebody's freaking Instagram post. That doesn't count. Get negative credit for that. You're getting dumber when you do that. Yeah. So what, what do you, what are you doing? How many words did you learn today? And by the way, this is brain maintenance too. Cause if you're not trying to learn new things, then your brain is deteriorating just like your body will.

Speaker 1:          01:27:38       So you've got that aspect. What about your creative output? What have you done in that capacity? Did you write us? Did you draw a picture? Did you write a story? Did you come up with a guitar riff that kind of rocks,

Speaker 1:          01:27:55       right? Did you, cause you may or may not have. My guess is you didn't. So how, what have you done that today? And where, and by the way, if you think, oh, I took a cool picture for Instagram and I'm kind of giving myself artistic credit for output right there. No, no. So, and then you start looking at all this stuff and you start adding it together. Your time that you've invested in your work and your family and your friends, and you're trying to try to teach your kids something and you're trying to read something and all of a sudden you look and you say, well, I don't have much time. And then you look at yourself and say, wait a second, why? Where did my time go, Dick? What grade do I get today for time management? Yeah. It's a big one because did I spend time doing things that I got negative value? Nevermind break even actually negative value.

Speaker 2:          01:28:48       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:28:50       And we don't have a grading system. We don't know what we're aiming at. We don't know what the potential is because that's what's cool about this. And you, you read these definitions, the high end, the outstanding, the eminently qualified. That is an unachievable human. Yeah. It's an unachievable marine. You will not be that good. You cannot hold all those categories. But let me tell you something that is no reason to not aspire to become the most eminently qualified human being that you can become just because it's an impossible path. Just because it's a path with no end to it. Just because you'll never reach the top of the mountain ever. You will not. You cannot. Guess what that is. No reason to stop. Guess what? Jujitsu, you're going to get tapped out. You're, there's always going to be someone that that can tap you out always.

Speaker 1:          01:29:44       100% of the time, the best guys in the world get tapped out. Yeah. The best guys in the world get tapped out. Boot Chechnya, Hodra Gracie, which touches the best guy in the world. What happens? He goes in GE and loses to Gracie. Tapped out. Submitted. Why is that? Because somebody is always, and what happened? Roger Gracie, by the way, when he fought Tim Kennedy, he got beat down. So there's always, you're never going to get to the top of the mountain, but that is not theirs. That is not a reason to, not to stop climbing. Just because you're not going to reach the top of the mountain doesn't mean you stop climbing. No, actually you climb Harger you see where you can get, but if you don't know what you're climbing, if you don't understand the mountain, if you can't see the summit, you don't know where to climb. And then you just look around and gone, well I might as well just slide down because it, it, it, it's, it takes physical and mental exertion to move up the mountain. And if I don't even know where the top is, I'm just going to, I can't tell where I am. I can't tell him from them halfway up the mountain, the quarter with the mountain, I can't tell from close to the top, bottom, top and can't tell. So there's enough reason for me just to sit around and do nothing. Break out the donuts, not the,

Speaker 4:          01:31:03       okay. So the way you started this was, was, um, with your navy experience as far as evaluations go and it, okay. So this is essentially what it would, it kind of translated to me what it was in the navy. The one that you were talking about was like everyone expected to get the, the, the perfect score. Right. And that was sort of the standard. And then the, in the Marine Corps one, it's kind of the opposite. Well No, the navy ones started on when I first got in the navy, basically everyone was a 4.0 and then they changed it because you need to force rank. And I dunno when the Marine Corps or if they made that change, but it, but they did because that's the way it is now. They're forced ranked for sure. Okay. So the, and the point is just the two different standards, like common like standards, right.

Speaker 4:          01:31:44       You know, when, cause you get this in other places too where it's like, oh, you know, it's just, uh, just your, here's your quarterly evaluation and I just put force, you know, cause I don't have any complaints about you kind of thing. It doesn't necessarily reflect how dope you really are. It's just, I don't horny how dope you could be. Yes, exactly right. So it's just more of like, okay, so the ceiling is pretty low is what it is by like a common like perception as far as the standard goes. Then you gotta have the opposite where it's like, oh, we all know no one's going to get a five. Like we all just know that. So we're, we're just kind of doing the best we can kind of thing. And in that way is better up for obvious reasons. But at the end of the day, it's like when you say, Oh yeah, you can literally be like you're topping out because as you get better and better, it's harder to get better and better.

Speaker 4:          01:32:29       Yes. So if, but you won't even get to those upper levels. If that ceiling was so low and you're ripping four is all day, they're all year, whatever. Man. I used to, um, he used to play his game. Super Mario brothers. You ever heard of that supermarket? I've ever played one single second of that particular video game. All right. Dang Bell. Okay. I played halo one time for about three minutes with some of the guys that was in my seal platoon. And then I just think it was after thought it was a, they were really good at it. They murdered me a bunch of different ways. Then I said, well, this is stupid. It's a video game. I don't care who wants to go grapple. Yeah, well that part is, I would say that that's true, but this the, the point still is consistent. So Super Mario brothers. It's okay.

Speaker 4:          01:33:21       See, it's Super Mario. There's a bunch of Mario brothers. This one is, this is more, this one is called Super Mario brothers original Nintendo entertainment system here. I don't want to say 1,904 old school. So Super Mario Brothers had four worlds, uh, sorry, eight worlds, four levels each world. So 32 levels. And you have an opportunity at various points in some levels to hit the warp, like the warp zone. So He'd go down a pipe in, it skips like all these levels, right? So you could see, you could essentially get through the game in maybe like, I don't know, six or eight levels. Okay. If you worked right, but if you chose not to work, you would have to go through all 32 levels. So I used to be able to go through all 32 levels, never dying one single time. Like I got really, really good at that.

Speaker 4:          01:34:13       You're for those either just listening and not seeing this on video echo looks super proud of that last statement. I mean I was a little bit embarrassed for him, but it's cool anyway. Okay, 32 levels. Here's why. Here's why that's significant though as far as Super Mario brothers goes, because you can easily pass the game, save the princess by just warping and it's still real hard. But you, you gotta, you know, you only go through a few levels compared to if you go through all the levels voluntarily, right? So once you save the princess by working, it's like cool, now you've got to go through all the levels. But if you can do that without dying, that's like that's super high level, right? As far as Super Mario brothers goes. So it's basically, so what's your points? So go to this two standards, go back to the two standards.

Speaker 4:          01:35:00       If you go for the stand it's like oh yeah, everyone gets a kind of a 4.0 kind of thing. That's like passing the passing of the game by warping. It's true. Like man, you passed the game in one man. Damn that's good. That's good by any standard really. You know I can't complain about that. But you've got to open up the standard little bit more go through all 32 levels, men without dying. Then you do it as quick as you can kind of thing. And if that standard kind of allows for all that, where you can't reach the top a little bit, like the standard isn't saving the princess standard is like something way greater. You see what I'm saying? So it allows you to get better and be evaluated on that, on that elevation while still not like capping out at a certain level.

Speaker 4:          01:35:39       You see what I'm saying? Switch. You got to do as far as the evaluation process goes. Okay Bro. I'm telling you, I'm telling you, look to Supermarine there's this thing they discovered. He was like a glitch in the game where you could like go to this one level and do this thing with a turtle shell and keep jumping on it and get like a thousand men, which is kind of a step backwards in a way. But that's just a side note day. Okay. How much time have you spent playing video games? Well, and what you could've done with your life. Yeah. Well keep in mind that guitar you could have played, you know, instruments could have mastered chess. You could have spoken another language instead of you're over here talking about how you did 32 levels in one minute. By the way, this is it. This gets you a really low grade.

Speaker 4:          01:36:32       We'll come up with a system. Your grade is going to be the low. Yes. As far as achievements goes, yes, very low. But as far as an evaluation process, did all that translated highly respect you? I did g Charles go dang man. Did He Kinda, yeah, sometimes there you go with it. That you finally got that respect too. You want and from that side, Mario Bros in fifth grade by the way. So you know a little bit different. Was that a humble brag? Like I did 32 levels by the way. I saw me in fifth grade. No, I think it was more of an aging thing actually. That wasn't a break at all because in fifth grade you could have been learning the language. Yes sir. Yeah, we're doing pull ups were actually, it was doing pull ups in fifth grade. That's legit. Yeah. Big Time.

Speaker 4:          01:37:13       I thought the check. Well, okay, here's the bottom line. We are looking to step up. We are looking at to, to become better, truly better. So what do you got for us? How can you, how can you help us get better? Yeah. To stay in the past. So, and actually that brings up a good point because we're on the path, quote unquote right, you whatever, all on the path and saying we're even saying we're on the past straight up saying, but like what is the path though? I mean, sure, there's some things, you know, we can go through it and you did too of course as part of it, but you don't have any evaluation kind of standard is what you say it. So yeah, I think that'll be how actually I'm really looking forward to it to be honest with you. Yeah. And the last digit.

Speaker 4:          01:37:57       So yes, that's on the path. Here's the, okay, so this will help us prep then. At the very least, prepare to be officially on the path and be evaluated the same time. Get jiggy, right. Step one kitty Geek. Step one, be get a rash guard. So where do we get our gies and get her keys from origin or [inaudible] dot com best cheese in the world. Factually. Actually the new rift is an hour. So let's just live re this is like when you put it Rifkey on and then go back to your old geezers. Like I said this before, this is a nonstarter. You're going to be mad at your old gay, you're going to be Trey, your old g. You're going to wonder why anyone ever made a ghee like they used to make them, but then again, then you're going to, then if you choose, you can revisit or you can visit that video that Pete put out about like, you know, made and like all this stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:38:50       It's like, oh, okay. That's why they didn't make it because what they went through to make it. Yeah. You know, not, not everyone's [inaudible] as usual, we are standing on the shoulders of giants because you always look at the way things have evolved and you have to take those iterative steps. No one just thinks of the iPhone, right? Somebody had to make a bunch of other phones before that and then even consider iPhone like right now. Like what is the newest one? I dunno, x or something. Something. 10 x is the tent and you know, Roman numerals. I guess I didn't know that at first. Anyway, the one in six years from now is going to make this x ten one you'd be like, oh, it's the old school. You know, like not unevolved neanderthal one. That's what going to feel like. That's what your old g will feel like.

Speaker 4:          01:39:39       Yes. A Non Neanderthal Geeky and you put it on the rift. Oh yeah. So you should get done. You can get the gies, you can get the rash guards, she can get other clothing do. You can also get supplements, which right now I am taking a ton of joint warfare. Yeah, I hurt my knee, which is not that big of a deal cause let's face it, I'm walking around, you know we're going to be fine. It's not that big of a deal. I don't want people to feel like, oh no, what happened? Don't worry. Everything is fine. I did however up the joint warfare and continue the Krill oil path, but the g the joint warfare, you can feel it in there, can feel it like little micro nano robots in there repairing stuff. Now you have to, you know, I know what happened with your Bicep, but the last time I hurt my other knee it was a disaster. And this one is already. So you guys get your joint warfare. I remember you. Well, I mean, of course I remember it because it was as recent as today where you're like around like Wolverine. But I'm like, yeah, well I dig it.

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       It's probably the joint warfare but has to, something to do with it. But also there's some, there's definitely, I definitely have been blessed with some sort of uh, ability to, to heal up a little quicker. Thank thankfully, knock on wood, that's what it seems like to me. Well also we have moke which is additional protein that happens to be delicious and taste like a dessert straight up. It's the way it goes with that also. Where are you kidding? Mock. Same deal just for the kids in the same deal, but they have strawberry or your kid milk, which is literally the best tasting thing in the world. Yeah. Uh, that has strawberry flavor cause men is still my favorite and we do have strawberry adult milk coming out. It need that and it is ridiculous. What is t and d test and evaluate. Oh, so I got the little package in the mail and it was so good.

Speaker 1:          01:41:52       So yeah, you can get that. You know, also discipline and discipline go. So discipline if you are going to train Jujitsu or you're going to do something that's going to require physical output and at the same time mental alertness. So that's, for me it was always about hey pre mission cause it when you're on a mission you have to be physically ready and you have to be mentally ready. You need a both aspects. And so that's why we made disciplines or you're ready for those things. And then also we have discipline go, which is a, which is a capsule. And the reason I made this is because sometimes I'm going to speak or I'm going to work with a company or I'm going to be in a board room all day and I want to bring my a game. Sure. And I don't want to have to drink a whole beverage because I don't don't need it at that time.

Speaker 1:          01:42:49       So I talked to Pete, Brian, we took the, the elements from discipline drink, put them into the capsule is that way if you need to bring your a game, you can get your discipline go and that will get you across the board and some will a little bit of Jocko white tea look good in the original, the original tea that Jellco was into. Yeah, just kind of a white tea. It's you know, at first but not sort of a stable, it's like synonymous, you know Jocko white tea. Yeah. It's just, it's synonymous with good taste. It's synonymous with 800 pound deadlift.

Speaker 1:          01:43:34       So there's that big time. Also the t is available at Jocko store cause yes Jocko has a store, which we already know but that's a good place to visit to stay in the game to represent while you're in the game. So if you want t shirts, we got some lightweight hoodies rolling, rocking and rolling. A lot of good evaluations. No comment. Yeah cause you haven't put one on yet because you haven't given me one. Well you know, let's face it, you kind of deserved that one. And it's also changing minds of people who were originally weren't really assign special forces over here. Psyops you know what? Hey, the truth be told they came out really good. Just even like the fit the design cat on the other night. Yes. There it is. One of them. There's two for this too. Okay. That's right. You can get truckers hats.

Speaker 1:          01:44:27       Yup. Patches on their watch or other stuff. Yeah, a bunch of cool. Sorry. Yeah. If you want to duck store.com if you want to represent while you're on the path while you're being evaluated, that might even be one of the evaluation, uh, scenarios. Your uniform. Come on anyway. I guess if someone's just a complete Slob, yeah. Then maybe they do need to step it up. Somebody. Yeah. Okay. Maybe uniform will be judged, but I doubt it. Well, okay. Well what be wearing a stinky geezer though. Oh yeah, no, that's, that's a uniform violation. Big Time. Yes sir. Oh, you didn't want to wash your g so now we all have to suffer. Yeah. Yeah. You're going to get punished. What of don't do that. Hey, the Rifkey the cool thing you can watch with your normal clothes. Yeah, because it's, and it'll dry. It's just not, it's not like when you put a regular g in and it's like you threw a 40 pound weight washing receipt and go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

Speaker 1:          01:45:29       Yeah. Yeah cause it all bunch of, that's all. And it takes nine hours to dry. Not the rift. A rift drives with your normal like quick dry tee shirts. Just about, did you see the video Pete head when he's like going into the fibers? Like he takes care of one fiber and it's like breaking in and it's hard to break. He puts the two and you can't even break it. The whole g is that, yeah, it's good man. Real good. Oh, so subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already. That is for black of a better term.

Then you've got extreme ownership, which I wrote with my brother Leif Babin where we took the leadership lessons we learned on the battlefield and explain how those can be applied to your business and life, and one of those lessons in that book is called the dichotomy of leadership. The dichotomy of leadership seem to be, as we continue to work with businesses, companies, leaders around the world, we found that the biggest problem that they had was balancing the dichotomy of leadership and when you can't balance the dichotomy of leadership, the multiple dichotomies of leadership, when you can't balance them, they derail your whole team. So get extreme ownership and get yourself the dichotomy of leadership so that you can understand how to truly apply these things effectively. Echelon Front, that's my leadership consultancy and what we do is solve problems through leadership.
