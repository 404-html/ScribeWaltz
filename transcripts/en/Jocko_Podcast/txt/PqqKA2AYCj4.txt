Speaker 1:          00:00          Jocko, dear Jocko, my chosen community has lost and continues to lose members due to suicide. One reason is that they don't ask for help. I think one reason they don't ask for help is that they're afraid of being or being seen as weak. I'm aware that this takes strength and discipline to be able to perceive, perceive when you need help and to ask for it. I don't know how to convey that to them. Could you address how one can gather support from their team without losing face? So there's an obvious reason why I paired these two questions.
