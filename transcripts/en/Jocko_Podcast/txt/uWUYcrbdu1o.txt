Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 66 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good evening, Echo. Good. Even at three 25 the true once again received orders to attack. I gave an order full of enthusiasm. I told the troop we attack and five minutes to the 70 [inaudible]. This is the movement we have all awaited. Although we knew the general locations of large enemy units, we had not received detailed intelligence about the enemy we were to encounter. I had a feeling however, that this time we would meet the enemy. Lieutenant Gaultier known for his deadpan sense of humor, asked on the radio, what kind of contact can we expect? I replied, enemy contact. He said, Roger, that's the best kind and the troop rolled forward through the blowing sand and that's a, that's a little excerpt from a personal account from a guy by the name of HR McMaster. You may have heard about recently coming into a higher profile job in the current administration.

Speaker 1:          00:01:23       But he's a very interesting guy. And I wanted to talk a little bit about his experience in some of the things that he said about this is the way he sees things. And so he was in this big battle in the first Gulf war as a captain. So you know, in charge of a a group of 140 guys and he fought in this battle called the battle of 73 east. And I'm gonna go to a little excerpt from Wikipedia that sort of gives you the broad idea of what was going on in the battle of 73 eastern refers narrowly to the violent armored combat action that took place in the final hours of second acrs covering force operation in the zone of Second Squadron and in the northern third of the third squadron zone in the battle for of second acrs armored cavalry, cavalry troops, troops, e g and I with troop k contributing to I troops fight totaling about 36 [inaudible] tanks, defeated two enemy brigades, the 18th brigade.

Speaker 1:          00:02:29       And later in the day, the Ninth Armor Brigade. So it's interesting you have a legitimate tank battle, right? Like a World War Two style tank battle that took place in the first Gulf War. And that's what this is talking about. And McMaster at the time McMaster's was in charge of eagle troop, so they got some good details in here. And again, this is a very simple, one of the best, clearest descriptions of what happened. It was actually on Wikipedia, so I just pulled some of that. So here we go. A little bit of what Eagle troop did at 4:10 PM Eagle true perceived fire from an Iraqi infantry position in a cluster of buildings. Eagle troop, Abrams and Bradley's returned fire, silenced the Iraqi guns, took prisoners and continued to east with the two tank platoons leading the nine m one tanks of Eagle troop destroyed 28 Iraqi tanks, 16 personnel carriers, and 30 trucks in 23 minutes with no American losses.

Speaker 1:          00:03:37       So you've got nine tanks against 28 tanks and 16 personnel carriers and 30 trucks and the nine tanks. When that's, that's this domination, battlefield domination. And there was a bunch of technical reasons as well as leadership reasons that we're going to get into. Next at about four 20 eagle crest at a low rise and surprised and Iraqi tent company set up in a reverse slope defense on the 70 easting. Captain McMaster leading the attack immediately engage that position, destroying the first of the eight enemy tanks to his front. His two tank platoons finished the rest. So they're just, they're just hammering, hammering these I Iraqi tanks three kilometers to the east. Mcmaster could see t 72 so those are the tanks at the Iraqi's are using in prepared positions continuing his attack past the limit, the 70 limit of advanced. So the way maps are set up, there's, there's coordinates on them and each one of the core does, has each one of the lines that runs north, south has a, has a label to it.

Speaker 1:          00:04:47       69707170270 three so he had been told not to go past the 70 easting that's what they're saying. That was his limit of advanced. These are all really common military terms. They say, Hey, you're not allowed to go past this road or this, this coordinate on a map, and they just call that a limit of advance. So he was supposed to stop at 70 he has to get after it a little bit harder. Continuing his attack past the 70 limit of advanced, he fought his way through an infantry defensive position and on the high ground along the 74 easting and this is going now that I mix this in here with the Wikipedia, which was a very simple explanation of what happened. Now going into a personal account that McMaster wrote himself when he was a young captain.

Speaker 2:          00:05:31       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:05:32       so here we go. From captain mcmasters account, Lieutenant Gifford called me from the command post to remind me that the 70 easting was the limit of advanced. We were already beyond it. I told him, I can't stop. We're still in contact. Tell them I'm sorry. Gifford explained the situation to the squadron headquarters on the radio. Major Mcgregor was forward with our tanks and fully understood the situation. If we had stopped, we have forfeited the shock effect we had inflicted on the enemy. Had we halted, we would have given the enemy for farther to the east and opportunity to organize an effort against us while we presented them with stationary targets. We had the advantage and had to finish the battle rapidly. We would press the attack until all of the enemy or destroyed or until they surrendered. So that's a pretty bold move to just push and it's also a risky move.

Speaker 1:          00:06:24       And I'll say the biggest risk of it is having a blue on blue situation unfold. I think it makes a lot easier the fact that this was day time and that that just makes it, everything's so much more clear in the daytime. But you could obviously make some mistakes if you're, if you're pushing you that limited advances there for a reason and you might have some other group that's controlling that sector. You also might have air power that the air power might be told, hey, if you see any vehicles moving past 70 easting you can start dropping bombs. So you do have to be very cautious when you make an aggressive move like this. And I bet McMaster himself would go back and say, you know what I should have done is I should've given him a heads up. Hey, I'm pushing past 70 easting please, you know, let everybody know.

Speaker 1:          00:07:05       So now this is going back to the, to the wiki account here. There he encountered and destroyed another tank unit of 18 t 70 twos in that acts in the Iraqi stood their ground and attempted to maneuver against the troop. This was the first determined defense the regimen had encountered and it's three days of operations still. The Iraqi troops had been surprised because of the inclement weather and we're quickly destroyed by the better trained and better equipped American troops. After defeating that force, McMaster send a scout platoon of two Bradleys north to regain contact with troop g and doing that, the Scout Platoon encountered another Iraqi tank position of 13 t 70 twos which they destroyed with tow missiles. So as these guys are just everywhere, they find these, these, these Iraqi tanks, they're just crushing them. And this is going back to McMaster's account again.

Speaker 1:          00:08:01       I jumped on top of my tank to give the crew room to cross load ammunition. While I monitored the radio. I surveyed the fires, which the which surrounded the troop. It seemed as if the action, it only lasted seconds. I felt no significant emotion during the battle. I think I had simply been too busy. I realized that I had not eaten all day. I tore into an Mre package and devoured a dinner of cold potatoes and ham. I gulped down some water and the quick infusion seemed to slow the flow of adrenaline. So I thought that was interesting. He was just doing his job, you know, he wasn't getting emotional and just getting it done. And then the ceasefire comes the next day and that's it. The war's over like, I mean this was the world. The war was 72 hours and the war's over and so he kind of talks about what he was thinking here.

Speaker 1:          00:08:58       Once they hear the cease fire back to McMaster's account, Eagle troop had taken no casualties. I and other soldiers offer prayers of thanks to God. We did not gloat over our victory. We'd simply done our part and liberating Kuwait from the treachery and inhumanity of Saddam Hussein and his Republican Guard. Henchman. We surprised the enemy on the 26th of February. That surprise and the bold action and teamwork of the troops soldiers contributed to the route that is now known as the battle of 73 easting. In general, the Iraqi's were unprepared for the United States army. Americans are better trained and equipped. The true decisive factor, however, was the American soldier. He is the best at what he does and absolutely dedicated to serving his country. Our soldiers were aggressive and battle yet demonstrated great discipline and compassion for their enemy. I am grateful that I had the opportunity to serve with them in this action. Captain Hr McMaster, each troop two to ACR.

Speaker 1:          00:10:12       So, and I didn't go into too much of a, I didn't go into it at all, but they took a lot of prisoners as well. They weren't just killing everyone. There was a lot of people that were surrounding a lot of Iraqi soldiers that were surrendering and they were doing their best to take care of those guys. And there are also some that pretended to surrender and then attacked. So they had a little bit of both and they, they as, as McMaster said, they showed great discipline and compassion for the enemy. Now I didn't, you can, you can go online and you can read the full account of what this whole battle felt like. But he, he recently wrote, so now he's a lieutenant who was a captain at the time, an o three and now he's a lieutenant general, a three star and there's a a website called the strategy bridge.org and there's an article there which is written by McMaster and he goes through the lessons that he learned in that battle.

Speaker 1:          00:11:10       And the, the, the article is called something along the lines of Hey, guidance for small unit leaders. So I thought there were some, some good solid lessons learned that he brought back. So I'm gonna go, go through it. Number one, lead from the front leaders must be forward to gain a clear picture and make decisions. As Sergeant Harris engaged with 25 millimeter lieutenant, got ta moved forward to assess and further develop the situation. So, so to explain that you've got a sergeant that's like engaging the enemy and then the lieutenant, he doesn't just sit there, he goes forward to find out what's going on and assess what's happening. So as a leader, when your troops are getting busy doing the work, what can you do? Don't get this. Don't get target fixated on your own guys and the work that they're doing. Look around, go forward. Move to a different position where you can see more. Back to the book, Go ta fired a tow missile into the center of the enemy position in the village to Orient our tanks. After our gunner, Staff Sergeant Craig Kotch fired a subsequent tank round to mark center. All nine tanks fired high explosive rounds into the village simultaneously just suppressed the enemy position despite the secondary explosions in the village to itself. First platoon maintained its primary observation to the east. So he's basically marking their position. Lieutenant go ta basically marks the position.

Speaker 2:          00:12:43       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:12:44       so not only did he move and observe what was happening, then he's directing. Everyone else wants it once he does that. So it's a really simple combat. You hear it all the time. Lead from the front. Now can you get too far forward? Yes, you absolutely can. If you're, if you're the guy that's actually engaging the enemy and you're having a, you know, either with your weapon in a tank or your weapon, your personal weapon on eight your your your rifle and you're the leader and you're actually shooting bad guys, well then you, you got some issues because you need to be looking around. You need to be seen what the next move is going to be. So lead from the front, but always the dichotomy is there. Don't go so far forward that you lose the ability to look around and observe what's, what's happening. Number two, shoot first

Speaker 1:          00:13:31       if you know we're friendly forces are and there is not a danger of civilian casualties, do not hesitate to shoot or conduct reconnaissance by fire. The side that shoots first has a tremendous advantage. Staff Sergeant David Lawrence was the commander of first platoon's northern most Bradley when his gunner, Sergeant Bradley Feltman's said, Hey, I've got a hot spot out there. I'm not sure what it is. Lawrence responded, put a toe in it, see what it is. A toe is a tow missile. Lawrence identified the hot spot as a t 72 as the term was ripped from its hall. In the ensuing explosion, our troops experience was consistent with Erwin Rommel's observation in his world war one book, infantry attacks. And this is Rommel talking. I have found again and again in encounter actions, any counteractions the day goes to the side that is first to plaster its opponents with fire.

Speaker 2:          00:14:27       Okay

Speaker 1:          00:14:28       shoot first and how do I translate that? Real simple, be aggressive. Now he points out very clearly here, you know where there's, where you know where friendly forces are. Yeah. Right. You know we're friendly forces are because obviously that can go sideways and by the way, when he pushed past his limit of advanced, now also no one knew where he was. So he need to be careful in that situation. But that that aggressive being aggressive with fire is something you have to do and you can see like they saw hotspot out there on their thermal, I don't know what this is. We have put a toner, which is, we know it's not good guys. Okay. Blasted. Yeah. We had a, I had been in Baghdad on my first deployment for like a couple days and we went out on a, on an operation in any ways. When we were coming back, we got ambushed and wasn't a big deal, but like w you know, we received fire and so we returned fire and, and basically we returned fire heavily in and we were getting after it.

Speaker 1:          00:15:35       This is when we didn't have any armor on her home. These, they were just, they were just open, they didn't have doors. So we didn't have armored Humvees. Not many people did in Iraq at that time in 2003 so what we had done is we had taken the doors completely off and then we'd taken our seats and turned them so they faced outwards. So we, and we, we'd have our feet like hanging out of the Humvee or maybe sitting on these, these big rails that we built along the side. And so we'd be facing out. It was, you were in a position, you were basically in a position to shoot at all times. And because of the way a Humvee set up with doors on either side and then people in the back, you had 360 degrees of, of visibility and of fields of fire coming out of every Humvee.

Speaker 1:          00:16:21       And so when we got, we were driving, we were on that, we'd just done a little operation. We were coming back and as we were coming back, we started taking fire. And so we just returned fired. It was a massive return of fire. Like I think the enemy was pretty overwhelmed with it. And we got back and everyone was kind of like, well we kind of, we kind of laid it down. We went through a lot of rounds in a very short period of time. And the reason I'm saying this story is because that was my platoon. And so we get back and, and we're kind of debriefing and then the next day we're going out in another operation. And I don't know if the story is going to make any sense, but the next day we were going out on another operation and one of my Bros who wasn't, who is my senior enlisted advisor at the time, but he wasn't on that mission that we just did and he's, he goes, listen, if you guys take contact, you need to shoot back.

Speaker 1:          00:17:14       You can't be afraid to fire it. And I made some combat like, don't worry, we'll be good to go in the one on one, here's afraid to shoot. Then everyone laughed because they knew that we put down a lot of lead. If you want to, if you want to trade bullets with us, we'll play that game. We don't mind trading some bullets. So the same thing though, if you start feeling like you're going to get contacted and then they, that's another thing they just teach us, you know, when you're in a firefight, where do you think the enemy might be? And we heard this a lot. The Korean marines were talking, or the the marines. The US marines that were in Korea. We were talking about that, hey, you're going to put fire down where we think the enemy might be cause that's where you know you're looking at a an area and there's a a good covered physician.

Speaker 1:          00:17:53       If there's a bad guy it's probably going to be there. Put fire on him. Yeah. Shoot. First lesson number two from general McMaster. All right. Number three, fight through the fog of battle. Be prepared for confusion and concurrent activity as we suppressed enemy positions in the village. While Lawrence was launching a missile, the troop received permission to advance to the 70 easting. I instructed first platoon to resume to resume movement to the east lieutenant pest check did not respond immediately because Lawrence was reporting on the platoon, radio net contact, contact east tank. Simple orders and complete reports are essential to maintaining common understanding in battle. So there's another example of got to keep things simple and he's specifically talking about how you communicate with other people on the radio. That's what he's talking about. You have to communicate simply and clearly in order for people to understand what's happening.

Speaker 1:          00:19:01       That can mean if you give Troy, a lot of times you see this, people try and give too much detail, right? That listen to this contact contact east tank. That's it. Where's the contact? It's to the east. What is it? It's a tank. That's it. That's what we need to know. Now everybody knows it's going on. If you said, hey, I've got a contact, he's about 480 meters. It is a t 72 tank. It's moving in an eastward. No, we don't care about any of that right now. We don't care about any of that. Just tell us what is happening. And that's one of the things that can help you fight through the fog of battle. Now that contact called is actually a standard operating procedure, I'm assuming, which is we, cause we would do this in the seal teams. You'd give what type of contact it is, what direction or sorry, what bearing and what distance.

Speaker 1:          00:19:47       So you'd say machine gun, fire hundred and 50 meters, four o'clock and now everybody gets a very quick read of what's happening because you can't, not everyone's gonna see where the firing came from. So even having a standard operating procedure to keep your, your verbiage limited is important. There's calls the whole, all everything we do in the seal teams basically has a very simple call that you can make and it's broken down into like three words. Contact Front online, you know, that's it. Everyone knows what to do. Every seal you tell them contact front online, they know what to do.

Speaker 1:          00:20:27       Number four, follow your instincts and intuition. As Sergeant Feltman launched the tow missile, I decided to go to a tanks lead formation and instructed green and white the tank platoons to follow my move. First platoon pulled in behind as the tank wedge moved and covered the tanks. Rear Third Platoon, retain responsibility for flank security. Gotta maintain that flank security. As we began moving forward, first platoon responding to the contact report on their platoon radio net began firing 25 millimeter high explosive munitions across the front. It was a little unnerving for the tanks. As we moved forwards, I gave first platoon a cease fire order red one. This is black sex cease fire. The two tank platoons were slightly delayed as our tank came over the crest of the imperceptible rise north of the village Sergeant Craig Kotch, the gunner reported tanks direct front, I counted eight t 70 twos and in prepared positions they were at close range and visible to the naked eye.

Speaker 1:          00:21:37       So east talking about trusting your instincts and trusting your intuition and my, and that's what he's doing here. He's seeing things happening, he's seeing things unfold and he's like, he says, Hey, go go into this formation. Boom. Everyone goes into his formation. He's acting off of instinct. But what's important here is where do your instinct and where does your intuition come from? It comes from training and experience. That's where it comes from. Now, it could be hard to get combat experience. We hadn't had a tank battle in, well since World War II, there's been no major tank battles and here these guys are, no, none of these people ever been in a tank battle before and now they're in a tank battle. So how do you do that? You got to do realistic simulated training. That's what you have to do and you have to make this realistic.

Speaker 1:          00:22:18       It's gotta be surprising. It's all the things I talk about all the time. It's gotta be surprising. It's got to be an unknown. You've got to do things that people aren't expecting. That's what you have to do so that they can develop their instincts so they can develop their intuition. Because if you're inexperienced and you don't know what you're doing and you just decide you're going to follow your instinct, your instinct can be wrong. It can be wrong. And the law, it's like Jujitsu, right? You take a new person in Jujitsu, their instincts are going to be wrong. Period. End of story, right? I mean, the classic is it someone is mounted on you. Then they knew. Yeah. You either do one of two things. You try and push them off of you, you're getting are locked or you turn around, you turn over and they're choking you.

Speaker 1:          00:22:57       But each one of your instincts is wrong. Your instinct needs to be elbow scape or you know, uh, Oompah escape. Got To be one of those two things. But those are instincts only come from training. And it's the same thing with these combat scenarios. How you ha you can't just try, don't just trust your instinct as a matter of fact. Yeah. Make sure you've trained yourself, make sure you've prepared yourself and then make sure that you detach. Cause that's another thing that can screw up your instincts is your instincts. You're feeling pain. You know, I was rolling with Andy yesterday. He will put like pain on me. He'll, he'll put his elbow in my ear or something and all he's trying to do is get me to, to make the instinctual move of all, I'm going to greet you up and pull his hand away if I do that I'm getting are mocked, right.

Speaker 1:          00:23:44       No. Can't do that. You have to just accept the pain. Yep. Just, just deal with it. Go grind harder, Andy, bring it here. Your instinct, if you start taking fire from a certain position, that could your instinct to be, oh, we're going to get down and move over here. You got to remember you've got to detach enough that you say, oh, I need to check my flank. I need to see what else is going on here. I need to assess these other situations that might be unfolding. Yeah, that's the, and that's where that kind of, well I am training you come in and a lot of it can be things that aren't really conscious to and it comes with like let's say, you know, relationship situation. Let's say, I know I'm sitting over here trying to talk about war fighting and you want to go straight to relationship to this earlier in the show when not even necessarily saying, you know, romantic or boyfriend, girlfriend, any kind of relations.

Speaker 1:          00:24:33       If you know the person really well, you can tell when something's off just a little bit and be like, hey something buddy. The guy would be like, oh no, no, all good. And they can, you know, they can be real convincing with, yeah, yeah, no, I'm all good, but you, you know your instinct because you have so much experience with them, you know? Yes, you're right. And you're right in the fact that, you know, when I talk about deescalation, right? If you come in and you say, Hey Jocko, this crap, what we were doing this, if my instinct is like, no, it's not crap, that's my instinctive response. Like, no, screw you. I'm right. You're wrong. But what I really need to do is say, hold on a second. Detach. Let's assess what Echo Sierra echo normally doesn't do this. Right? Why is he doing this? Something is going on.

Speaker 1:          00:25:13       Don't, I'm not going to trust my instinct right now. Luckily, like you said, through training, through knowledge, right? In this situation, I know that you don't act that way. So yes, follow your instincts, follow your intuition, but make sure that you've trained to develop them. And also I like to question him when I feel something, I just don't go with it immediately. I want to go with it. And I most likely will go with it, but there's also a possibility. I say, well not a possibility, but what as I say, hey, we need to move. Here I go, okay, what could be happening? Is this a position that the enemy might be in? Is this a a move that could be getting set up on me? No, I think I'm pretty solid. Or at least as I move there, I'm going to be aware of it.

Speaker 1:          00:25:53       I'm trusting my instinct, but I'm being cautious. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy how like you hear that talking police, you know like cops have like good in for sure. The repetitious patterns. Sure. Of Bad guys. Yeah, for sure. I was going to say something else too. Oh, there's plenty of times where if you don't trust your instinct you will get crushed. Right? I mean you think about in a Jujitsu perspective, but when you get good, you're not thinking about anything. You, you have to just use your instinct, your, you're training, your muscle memory is what's working. And the same thing with police. You know, they get to a point of you going into a situation and if they're not going off their instinct, they're gonna get, they're gonna get burned. Yeah. Cause they learned, you know? Yeah. And that's the trained instinct. How you were saying they train as opposed to the untrained in kind of get a one being a, being a police officer out on the beat.

Speaker 1:          00:26:46       You're not going to have, they're not going to have an a fraction of what you deal with that cop 10 years later. Yeah. And you and that cops, hey listen, I see your hand, I see you got some blood on your knuckles. I know what happened here. Tell me what's going on. You know what I mean? Whereas a young guy might be old school in your face about softer. Yeah. Or guys like being too nice. You know how like the cop can tell like, oh this guy's being tuned ice. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. There's like a mediocre level of niceness that's like, okay, that seems like, like he's mellow, but if a guy's being like too aggressive or too defensive or too nice, they can tell you. I know there's something I'm suspicious, you know? Yeah. He'd be a new that might not be able to tell that.

Speaker 1:          00:27:23       You know what I mean? Yeah, no, absolutely. All right. Next one. Number five, use standard unit fire and battle drills. Aim to overwhelm the enemy upon contact and retain the initiative through speed of action. As sergeant catch fire the main gun and destroyed the first tank, I sent a contact report to the troop. This is black. Six contact east, eight armored vehicles, green and white. You with me? Sergeant conch destroyed two more tanks as our tank platoons, accelerated movement. All nine tanks began engaging together as we advanced in approximately one minute. Everything in the range of our guns was in flames. Fire distribution and control allowed us to destroy a much larger enemy force in a very short period of time.

Speaker 1:          00:28:18       So how do they do that? Good solid, disciplined, standard operating procedures. And you, I'm telling you, you, you think about how simple this is. He says, this is black six contact east eight armored vehicles or green. Why are you with me? That's the whole, that's the whole detailed plan. Hey, there's bad guys over there. We're moving east, let's go. And everybody says, all right, we've done this thousands of times. We've drilled it, we rehearsed it. What? What do we do right now? And they probably had little standard operating procedures. Hey guys, on the, you know, on the left flank are going to start flying at the left vehicles of guys on the right flank. And they had all these procedures work out so that in less than a minute victory, less than a minute. So develop those good standard operating procedures, disciplined procedures. And when I talk about freedom on the battlefield, this is exactly what I'm talking about. Discipline equals freedom on the battlefield because when you have those discipline procedures, he doesn't even have to see it. The freedom to maneuver. He has a freedom just to say, hey guys, there's the enemy. Let's take care of them. Boom. It's done. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:29:27       Next one. Number six foster initiative. Every trooper understood how our platoons and the troop conducted fire and maneuver our tank driver, special ed specialist Christopher Heden. Sog knew that he had to steer a path that permitted both tank platoons to get their guns into the fight. He turned 45 degrees to the right and kept our frontal armor towards the first enemy tanks we engaged, he drove through a minefield, avoided the anti tank mines reporting on the intercom. Sir, I need you to know we just went through a minefield. He knew that it would be dangerous to stop right in the middle of the enemy kill zone. Heden Skog saw that our tank platoons had a window of opportunity to shock the enemy and take advantage of the first blows that Sergeant Kotch delivered. So clearly this is decentralized command, right? And you just think about this first. Every trooper understood how our platoons and the troop conducted fire maneuver.

Speaker 1:          00:30:26       Everybody knows what to do. Everybody. And here's this kid, he's probably 18 years old. Is he a specialist? Yeah, specialists. He'd probably 19 years old and he's got he leaving, right? The commander's in charge. But there's the guy that's driving that's picking the course where they're going to go. And again, think about this, the captain, he's not saying like 86 degrees, the left six degrees to the right, get 40 no, he's not giving any of those orders. And if you think about it, could he have been able to do that? He's dealing with all this other stuff. You're dealing with fire control. He's dealing with, uh, the position he's reporting back up the cheese, got all this other stuff going on. He doesn't have time to tell this guy where to go, but it's decentralized command. That specialist that is leading the tanks from an actual driving perspective.

Speaker 1:          00:31:13       He knows what to do. He knows the procedures, and so he's able just to do it. He even knows, he knows it so well that when he sees that we're in a minefield, he assesses the threat. Okay, we're in a minefield by c three minds. I'm going to steer around them the best I can, but if we stop, we're going to be, we're going to be open to getting attacked by the enemy. So you know, we're gonna do, we're gonna keep moving. And he made that decision on his own of the right decision. He made that decision on his own because he understood the overall objective and the procedures that they would follow and what was most important. So that's a great example of decentralized command.

Speaker 1:          00:31:55       Number seven, use tanks to take the brunt of the battle tanks drove around the anti tank mines and Bradley's and other vehicles followed in their tracks. Our squadrons s three tank commanded by major Douglas Macarthur. Mcgregor hit an anti tank mines but the blast damage to the tank only slightly. It continued the attack and made a repair. When we halted, we ran over anti personnel mines, but they sounded like pop microwave popcorn popping and had no effect on armored vehicles. The rate of our fire of our tanks allowed enemy tanks to fire only to aerate main gun rounds at the outset of the battle and to later as the troop assaulted enemy machine gun fire had no effect on the troops advance. The psychological shock of our tanks advancing undaunted toward their defensive positions paralyzed and panicked. The enemy.

Speaker 1:          00:32:59       So if you don't know anything about what I'm talking about, I apologize. But tanks are massive. A one Abrams tanks are massive and they have extremely heavy armor. They're 68 tons. And as he's saying here, these, even the anti tank mines aren't, aren't, aren't stopping the tanks and the, the Pr Anti-personnel just has nothing but Bradlees are smaller, not as big, not as big and not as heavily armored. So the, the tanks are laying down, you know, driving and then the Bradlees are just falling in their tracks in case they hit any minds the, they would hit the Abrams tank. But what I said when I take about, so how can we apply this to, you know, everyday life, how can we apply this to business? You know the saying technically specifically use tanks to take the brunt of the battle, right? This, this is the way I look at this from a business perspective and from a life perspective, play to your strengths, right?

Speaker 1:          00:34:04       What is the strongest thing they've got are these tanks and it's the same thing that we run into in business, and it's the same thing you run into in life and Jujitsu everywhere. What are you, what are you strong at? What are your strong areas? And that's what you focus on. That's what you use to lead your, your advanced. Now, do we train for our weaknesses? Absolutely. You know, we do that all the time. Do we? Do we, when we have a weakness in a business, we don't go, hey, let's just cover this up. No, we, we focus on it so that we can prove it, but if we're going to go to market with something, let's go to market with something that we're good at, right? If we're gonna, if we're going to try and set up some expansion into a new area, let sucks set up the expansion into an area area that we're familiar with, that we're good at, that we're strong in.

Speaker 1:          00:34:52       Let's not say, Hey, you know what we've been making, we've been making cars for the last 50 years. Let's go over here and make computers. No, we're going to make cars. Okay, let's make trucks too. We know how to build vehicles. That's what I'm saying is, and you see this all the time, would you do to, what do Jujitsu guys do? What they should do, which is try and try and play to your strengths, right? Yeah. In in competition. Competition. Yeah. Right. Of course, when we're, when we're training, we prayed our weaknesses, right? We want to, Oh, I'm, I don't like people being across side. Cool. Let him get across side. Yeah. I don't like being on the bottom. Cool. I'm going to be on the bottom. But in competition, what are you good at and how do you get the person to play your game? Yeah. That's the question. And that's everything too, right? Like even at work, you're going to train the new guys, but you're not going to send the new guy, you know, to make contact with a potential client or something. Be Quiet. Don't send the new guy. Send the strongest and the tank and the m one Abrams to meet the new client. That's got big potential. So play to your strengths. Use tanks to take the brunt of the battle.

Speaker 1:          00:36:01       Next, be prepared for misfires and degraded operations. Lieutenant Jeff Desantos tank crew came around the village, destroyed an enemy tank and acquired a second tank at very close range that was traversing on them around. Got Stuck in the breach of the cannon, meaning this, this can is not going to shoot anymore. The loader grabbed hold of the loaders hatch kicked around in the breach, came up and the Gunner Sergeant Matthew Clark destroyed the t 72 in another example, staff sergeant Digby ordered Private First Class Charles Brewer Toobin to reload tow missiles per tubing. Could not get the cargo hatch open. However, when the lightweight wrestler guys a wrestler, good for him, kick the hatch release. He sheared it off. Rather than tell Bradley his Bradley commander that he could not get the toes reloaded, he jumped out of the back door while the vehicle is under small arms and machine gunfire.

Speaker 1:          00:37:04       He climbed onto the back of the Bradley, loaded both missiles, then tap the his Bradley commander on the shoulder while yelling toes are up. Staff Sergeant Digby nearly jumped out of his skin because he thought an Iraqi had climbed onto the Bradley. So here's these little malfunctions going on with your weapons and what do you do? You deal with it, and I think I said this on the last podcast with life, we have a little saying nothing works. Everything sucks, right? And that's what you got to prepare for. You count. If you rely 100% on those radios, those radios aren't going to work. If you rely 100% on your weapon, okay, you better learn those drills. You better learn how to, how to fix and adjust your weapon very quickly. Go to your secondary, whatever the case may be, you've got to drill those things. Got to be ready for problems.

Speaker 1:          00:37:53       You gotta be ready for Murphy's law to kick in next. Number nine, coordinate between platoons and ensure mutual support. The burning tanks and personnel carriers of the enemy's first defensive line formed a curtain of smoke that concealed enemy further to the east as our tanks assaulted through the smoke, we saw other enemy, armored vehicles and large numbers of infantry running to get back to subsequent trench lines and positions. We destroy the enemy armored vehicles quickly and shop the infantry with machine guns. As we closed the distance with them, pockets of enemy soldiers threw up their arms are soldiers were disciplined. Turrets turned away from any enemy soldier with his hands raised tank platoon leaders asked a scalpel tunes to pick up observation of the enemy infantry as their Bradley's came through the smoke, the scouts saw that the enemy had used a false surrender to gain a better position. Enemy soldiers were re shouldering the rifles and rocket propelled grenades are Bradley's surprised the enemy and killed them before they can engage our tanks effectively covered move, cover move real simple. That's what that one is mutually supporting. That means we're helping each other out. That's what cover move is next. Number 10 take risk to win because eagle true press the assault, the enemy could not respond effectively,

Speaker 1:          00:39:33       right? That's that. You're going to find that in 80 case. You want to get the person on their heels. You want to get your opponent on their heels. As we cleared the western most defensive positions, our executive officer, Lieutenant John Gifford, broken on the radio. I know you don't want to know this right now, but you are at the limit of advance. You are at the 70 easting. I responded, tell them we can't stop. Tell them where to contact and we have to continue to attack. Tell them I'm sorry we and that's a part I already covered. We had surprised and shocked the enemy stopping would have allowed them to recover. As Erwin Rommel observed an infantry attacks, the man who lies low and awaits developments usually comes off second best. It is fundamentally wrong to Holt or to wait for more forces to come up and take part in the action.

Speaker 1:          00:40:31       Eagle troop continued to attack toward another very subtle ridgeline on the enemy position on which the enemy position his reserve, a coil of 18 t 72 techs, major Mohammed later told one of our troopers, this is the enemy commander of this unit. Major Mohammed later told one of our troopers that he had not known he was under attack until a soldier ran into his elaborate command, bunker yelling tanks, tanks. By the time he got to his observation post all the vehicles in defensive positions to the West, we're in flames. He ordered the reserve behind him to establish a second defensive line. It was too late. The Eagle troops tank crested the rise and entered their assembly area. The tanks were starting to move out when we destroyed them at close range.

Speaker 1:          00:41:25       So it's not only take risk, it's to be aggressive. That's gotta be your default mode. Default mode is aggressive press attack and it, it's interesting when, I mean clearly it happens in combat. You start getting the upper hand, keep going, keep going. And it happens in Jujitsu as well. You know, if you can get that person on the run, you're attacking them with two, three, four different things at the same time. That's when they're done and that's a bad feeling when you're, when that's happening to you, you're falling behind in the Ooda loop and they're just getting, getting all inside your loop. You're defending something that you feel the other thing happening. Yeah, not good, but again, take risk. But yes, be aggressive. Now those word, the lessons from this, this one battle, you know this one battle at 73 easting and now obviously McMaster stayed in the army.

Speaker 1:          00:42:23       He went up through the chain of command and, and now we're going to go to 2005 2006 the battle of [inaudible] in Iraq, which this, this battle was led by who is now our kernel McMaster. He was a captain at the time of this 73 easting battle. Now he's a commander who's commanding the third ACR, the Third Armored Cavalry Regiment, and this is very similar to the battle of Ramadi. What happened in California and the reason, one of the reasons why it's so similar is that Colonel Macfarlane, who was the commander of the one one d that led the fight in Ramadi, that I was there to support. The first thing he did when he went back to Iraq, when when Mcfarland went back to Iraq for that deployment in 2006 he took over for a McMaster and McMaster was in tallow far so mcfarlane shows up and [inaudible] and says, Hey, this is what I did.

Speaker 1:          00:43:27       I did a little something called cs, clear hold and build. This is the strategy. We pushed into these NV controlled territories and, and then it becomes so pacified in Talla far that they were able to take most of the one one 80 and send them down to Ramadi. And when they got down to Ramadi, Mcfarland, who's a brilliant guy, had listened to everything McMaster said, looked at how he did it, and then applied the same strategy in Ramadi. Now he had to make adjustments to it for sure because it wasn't exactly the same. But luckily he was a smart creative guy that said, oh, we've got to make these adjustments. But he did it. But the overall concept came from what McMahon from what McMaster did up in Taliph are. And so there was an article in the New Yorker written by a guy named George Packer. And the article is called the lesson of tallow far is it too late for the administration to correct its course in Iraq?

Speaker 1:          00:44:29       And this, this article came out April 10th, 2006, probably three or four days before I arrived in Ramadi in 2006. So that's when this article came out and you can see he's saying, hey look, is it too late to correct the course will actually, um, a lot of people in 2016 weren't even admitting that we were on the wrong course. You know, cause what we're doing at that time, and I've talked about this a bunch, what America had been doing at that time is his going out grabbing bad guys one at a time, two at a time and bringing them back to base and putting them, arresting them, capture, kill missions. And what's interesting is that's that's, that's an attrition, that's a war of attrition, right? You have certain number of bad guys, we're going to go catch them all. And he really wasn't working. It really wasn't working.

Speaker 1:          00:45:24       That's why in 2005 2006 enemy attacks were up 300% and you know, 2005 2006 our whole country, well I shouldn't say our whole country, but many people in our country, including a lot of major politicians were saying it was unwinnable and you know, we, we just need to get out and it was a quagmire and all that stuff. So that's because we were not on the right strategy. And actually if you take this and you apply it back to Hackworth, when he basically said during the end of the Vietnam War and he said, look, we're not going to win. He wasn't talking about we couldn't, when he was saying, we're, we're fighting the wrong kinds of tactics. We're doing the wrong thing here. You keep saying, Hey, what's our body count? What's our body count? What's our body count? That's a war of attrition. Hey, we lost this many guys.

Speaker 1:          00:46:11       You lost that many. That's an attrition warfare. It's World War One. I always use World War One is the classic attrition warfare. Hey, we're going to go over the trench. We're to kill as many of you is. You can and hopefully it's less than, well, awesome. We're going to see you can last longer. That's a punchy. That's, that's, hey echo. We're just going to stand here. You Punch me, I'll punch you. You Punch me. And whoever goes down, you know loses. Well, guess what? What do we look like at the end of that? We're all beat up her, right? Both of us. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how good we are. So these guys were thinking maybe instead of doing punches to the face, we should do little Jujitsu, a little something, a little bit more, more tactically sound. And it wasn't just go out, grab bad guys, just go out and try and kill bad guys because we learned 2003 2004 2005 that's three years of doing those type of operations and real progress wasn't being made.

Speaker 1:          00:47:00       It's certainly wasn't made. And in Ramadi at this point, again, there was guys that were doing incredible work and you do have to go out and, and attack the bad guys and go after those critical notes for sure. But we were focused so much on that that we were at ignoring a lot of what was happening with the populace and politically other, other areas that needed to be addressed. So this article came out, and again, it's from the New Yorker written by George Packer came out 10th 2006 and here's what we're going to this article back to the article. The lesson that McMaster and his soldiers applied in Talla far were learned during the first two years of an increasingly unpopular war. When we came to Iraq, we didn't understand the complexity, what it meant for a society to live under brutal dictatorship with ethnic and sectarian divisions.

Speaker 3:          00:47:53       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:54       He said in his course, energetic voice. When we first got here, we made a lot of mistakes. We were like a blind man trying to do the right thing, but breaking a lot of things later. He said, you gotta come in with your ears open. You can't come in and start talking. You really have to listen to people. I mean, okay. That is just, this whole thing is just a, a great summary of a humble man, right? He's saying, look, when we came here, we didn't understand the complexity. That's humility. He says, we didn't understand what it was like to live under brutal dictatorship. That's humble. He says, when we first got here, we made a lot of mistakes. He's not saying all, we did everything right. No, we made a lot of mistakes. We were like a blind man trying to do the right thing, but breaking a lot of things. So they're trying, he admits it. We're trying, but we're breaking a lot of stuff later. He said, listen this, you gotta come in with your ears open. You can't come in and start talking. Okay. Leaders around the world pay attention to that right there. You don't need to come in and start talking, come in with your ears open and listen. And he says, you really have to listen to people.

Speaker 3:          00:49:14       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:49:14       very clear. Very great leadership guidance right there. Back to the article.

Speaker 3:          00:49:20       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49:21       They didn't even want to say the I word. One officer told me it was the specter of Vietnam. They did not want to say the insurgency word because the next word you say is quagmire. The next thing you say is the only war America has lost Vietnam. And the next thing you conclude is that certain people's division of war is wrong. So we had a hard time again, just as America admitting, Hey, this isn't just a bunch of thugs running around. There's an organized insurgency here. We needed fight it like an insurgency. We had a hard time making that mental transition as a nation. And I'll tell you when I, I've told this story before, when I got to Ramadi and I looked at what was going on, I literally read the counterinsurgency manual that was written by basically by General Petraeus who's a brilliant guy. And these guys, McMaster, I think macfarlane, they all helped him write that article or write that book. So this was a totally different attitude. And you know, you hear it here that people, people back in d c they didn't even want to use the word insurgency. They want to use that word because it, it makes everyone think of nom and we lost, right?

Speaker 1:          00:50:44       So the article, I'm going going a little bit deeper on that, back to the article, the Pentagon strategy in 2003 and 2004 was to capture, was to combat the insurgency simply by eliminating insurgence and approach called Kill capture. [inaudible] SAP, a retired special forces officer who now teaches at the naval postgraduate school in Monterey, California. Set of the method. It's all about hunting people. I think it comes directly from the secretary of defense. I want heads on a plate, so he's talking about Rumsfeld right there. You'll get some people that way, but the failure of that approach is evident. They get Hussein, they get his sons, they continue to work every week to kill more, capture more. They've got facilities full of thousands of detainees, yet there's more than surgeons than there were when we started in dereliction of duty. Mcmaster wrote that a strategy of attrition was in essence the absence of a strategy one a great line.

Speaker 1:          00:51:54       That is right and so, so McMaster wrote a very harsh critique of the Vietnam War and the way it was run. Again, not, not a critique of the boots on the ground and the troops that fought, but a critique of those back in BC that were running it. And you know, this is just, this is just an incredible statement that a war of attrition is in essence the absence of strategy. This is like, okay, what do you do? What do, I'm just going to, we'll go kill as many of us and we can't. Okay. That's if the, if that's your strategy, not a strategy. It's like when you get new an MMA fight, what's your strategy? And the guy goes, I'm going to punch him in the face until I win. Right? That's not a strategy. Put My head down. And definitely a good strategy. Don't, don't do that. You need to have a little bit more strategy than that. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:45       Um, back to the article. If we're not stupid and we don't quit, we can win this thing. And again, what's important is the 2006, this, this major McCaughlin Maclaughlin, he's another person that's interviewed in this article. He's talking about like, we could lose this thing, right? So if we're not stupid and we don't quit, we can win this thing. Major, Major mclauchlan said, history teaches you that war at its heart is a human endeavor. And if you ignore the human side, yours, the enemies and the civilians, you set yourself up for failure. It's not about weapons, it's about people.

Speaker 1:          00:53:33       That's very, it's very true. And I'll tell you where it's true. It's true in war, clearly. And it's true in business too. And you get people that don't understand the human side of business. They don't understand that they're dealing with human beings and they treat people like numbers. They're not going to be successful. Now you also get people that go so far in the other direction, that's all they care about is their people. And guess what? Now they're making bad business decisions and they're hiring more people and they're keeping them. They're not letting anyone go and they're running themselves in the ground because their overhead's too much and they caused destruction. But on the other side, you've got someone that's now bean counter, right? Nope. You let that person go no severance or whatever limited you do that methodology, you're gonna end up with no business either because they've people there.

Speaker 1:          00:54:21       Because there are people, if you treat them like robots, they're not going to work for you. They're going to, they're going to rebel against you. The robot will do what the robot is told, but people aren't robots. So you got to remember that human side and obviously in war and that's, that's one of the reasons that we're able, if we're able to talk about this stuff to businesses, we're able to talk about combat leadership to businesses. The first, oftentimes, the first thing that the business that's bringing us on has to get a grip on is the fact that we were in charge of people, not terminator robots, right? We Lafe and I use that term all the time, that people think, oh, you're in the military. Oh, you run a navy seals. They do whenever you, no, no, not true. There are people, and guess what?

Speaker 1:          00:55:11       The enemy are people, they have thoughts, they have passions, they have desires, and guess what? The civilian populace that you're working amongst, those are human beings too, and they're not just going to listen to what you say and you can't just for instance, can't just throw money out them, right? You can't just throw money at them. They don't care about that money. You, you know, it was really interesting. I talked about this, this new story I saw on vice news of a guy going into, he was, uh, I don't remember the reporter's name, but he's a young reporter, spoke Arabic and he goes into Ramadi wall. It was surrounded by Isis and Isis was getting ready to take over. And he's saying, Hey, he's talking to just normal people. And he's talking to this one guy. And he says, you know, the guy saying, look, we really need help. We hope America comes back. And the reporter says, well, why don't you just leave? You don't want you to get out of here. And the guy says, I live here. I live here. I'm not going anywhere. That's a human right. That's a human, that's a sentimental value. It's like my house that I live in, you're not going to take my house from me. Like if you, if people came to try and take my house away from me, there'd be a fight. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:56:29       it wouldn't end well for anybody. No, that's sentimental, right? So you have to remember that these human beings are human beings. And that's the, one of the key things that, that McMaster really mcmasters really understood, really understood this fact. And, and you know, I'm giving a lot of credit to McMaster, but there, there's a lot of, I mean there's way more guys that I'm talking about that I don't have them going through their names, but there's a lot of guys that contributed to this idea and did an outstanding job. Um, you know, he's getting the credit because he's gotten charged, right? I'm giving him some credit because he's the guy in charge. But I guarantee if you asked him, he'd say, well, no, I had this captain that this, and I had this major that did that. And he had all these people, but he's the guy just like if something's gone wrong, he'd be responsible.

Speaker 1:          00:57:19       We'll some stuff went right. So you get the credit. They're general. Now he wrote these, these four fallacies of warfare, which I find very, very interesting. And so we learned kind of the tactical side of what he learned from his battle. The 73 he stings easting. You know, he had 10 lessons learned. Pretty tactical stuff. Right? Now we're getting into a little bit more strategic level. We're talking about war as a broad in a broad sense. And so here's what he says about these four fallacies of war warfare. There are four fallacies about future war that are preventing us from learning from our most recent experiences. Mcmaster said, these fallacies are portrayed in such a way that they reduce risk to United States interest, when in fact they exacerbate risk because they over rely on capabilities and they purposely ignore continuity's in the nature of war. Okay? So he's saying, look, the, the way they portray these things is it makes everything good for America, but they actually make things worse for America.

Speaker 3:          00:58:32       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:58:33       Because they ignore things in war that are always the same. This is war we're talking about. The nature of war does not change. Okay? His first fallacy,

Speaker 3:          00:58:46       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:58:47       The vampire fallacy, it's a vampire fallacy. It's a vampire because you can't kill it and it comes back every 10 years. This is the belief that a narrow range of technological capabilities we'll deliver fast, cheap, and efficient victory in future war. The latest manifestation is the belief in a new range of technological capabilities. Everything from big data analytics to artificial intelligence to drones and robotics and so forth. So, so what does that mean? We have an idea that we can, as a, as a nation just we are, we're so technologically advanced that nothing can stand up to us and we can just use these precision weapons to take out enemy targets. And then it's over. It's a fallacy. It's a vampire. It's going to come back. You can't just kill it. It's gonna come back. And you know, obviously we've seen, we saw that in Iraq. We had all kinds of technological advances over the enemy,

Speaker 4:          00:59:50       but

Speaker 1:          00:59:52       they continued to come back. And when we walked away, they came back strong. They were called Isis. Now I think that's pretty self evident what that means now. What does this mean in business and in, in, in life? Well, to me what this means is there's no easy solution. There's no easy solution to things, right? We look at something, we go, oh, we can just do this. We can just use some new technology or we can just use some APP, right? Oh, if I get an APP to track my diet, then I'll be good to go. No, you've got to stop putting the sugar in your mouth to be good to go.

Speaker 1:          01:00:42       People want the shortcut. They want to, they think that there's an easy way to get things done. And there's not. You have to do the work. There's a vampire out there. What you got to do is you got to grab that vampire. You gotta cut its head off. You got to soak it in holy water, and then you got to dry. It's bones out in the sun that that's what kills a vampire. All right? That's the attitude you have to take. You can't just think there's going to be a shortcut. We'll be able to, we'll be through with this of empire. You know, tomorrow, cause I have a, uh, a cool gun. I'm gonna shoot him. No bullets. Don't kill him. Got to go harder. Yeah. I think the

Speaker 5:          01:01:27       correct, the way to kill a vampire isn't to cut his head off. It's the, it's the wooden stake into the heart. That's, I think you might be thinking I'm going to do so or something. Okay. Just kind of Fyi. The holy water part with correcto. Yeah. Just, just so Fyi, I don't, I don't mean to call you out here. I actually googled how to kill a vampire that's wrong though. Mythologies. It says otherwise he, you stick a wooden stake in his heart. Crucifix. We'll get them. If you have faith, sunlight will kill him. So that was correct. Holy Water. Holy Water. We'll get a murmur. Sure. Yeah. And um, yeah, yeah. I Dunno what, what website said? Cut his head off. Uh Oh. Don't trust Google lesson learned. See, you know what I did right there. Took a shortcut. Oh yeah. I took, I thought it was a vampire. Just Google it real quick. We're going to go, you know what you did. This is what, this is what I think you did. I think you googled it, which is fine, but here's the thing about googling something. Googling is not the answer. It's what you find from Google. And if you just go for the first one or the one that looks like, because most people see the Iraq. The irony here is that I tried to take a shortcut and I'm wrong, and that's the same. That's the vampire fallacy in its own right.

Speaker 1:          01:02:39       Proves the point. All right, next, the zero dark 30 fallacy. And that's the name of a movie about the, the killing of bin Laden. This is the idea, the zero dark 30 fallacy. This is the idea that all you have to gain to do, to gain a victory in war is to gain visibility of an enemy's network structure and then conduct raids against that network, either with special operations forces or notes. So the problem with both these fallacies, of course, they represent important capabilities you need to have, but these are capabilities that masquerade as strategies and simple solutions to the complex problem of war, neglecting wars, political nature, neglecting wars, human nature, neglecting wars, inherit uncertainty based on the interactive nature. And finally neglecting that it is ultimately a contest of wills.

Speaker 1:          01:03:50       So the idea that you can, again, it's attrition warfare and I, I'll be honest with you, I never really looked at this as attrition warfare until I was reading researching for this podcast. I never, I always said, hey, you know, it's raid mentality. Hey, we can just capture all the bad guys. But to say, yes, that's attrition warfare. That's exactly what it is. And especially for me, because I look at World War One as so awful, and it's an example of attrition warfare, and that's what makes it so bad. This is attrition warfare to, Hey, we're just gonna capture, kill all the bad guys. How do you do that? What we're forgetting is the, what about this line? When you do that, when you just say, Hey, look, all we need to do is, is captured. Kill the bad guys. This is what you do.

Speaker 1:          01:04:32       You masquerade this, that capability to be able to do that, which is an awesome capability, awesome capability. But that mass back capability masquerades as a strategy and what you listen to, the things that you forget about this list is classic. The complex problem before you neglect wars, political nature, human nature, inherent uncertainty, interactive nature, and you neglect that. It's a contest of wheels. So that's, and there's some great youtube videos where mcmasters talking about that big lesson, learning that this raid mentality was, it's part of, it's part of the way you defeat an insurgency. Part of the way you defeat insurgency is capture. Killing the bad guys. It's awesome. But there's so much more you have to address. That's like saying, Hey, the way you win a Jujitsu is to arm lock the person. You can even say as broad as that way you win in Jujitsu is to submit somebody. Right? So if I taught you every submission I knew, but I didn't teach you how to transition, didn't Chichi hourly positions you would. There's no way you could win. It's the same thing here. Is Submission important? Yes. That's what a rate is. A rate is the submission. It's one piece of it. It's not the whole game though. It's not the whole game. And I think that's what he's making very clear here through that zero dark 30 fallacy. Next one.

Speaker 2:          01:06:01       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:06:02       Is The wild kingdom fallacy. Back when America was wholesome, there was no reality TV, no Kardashians or anything. So on Sunday nights, American families would watch this wildlife show called mutual of Omaha's wild kingdom. And that show, what happened on that show is the host Marlin Perkins would send his assistant Jim to conduct exotic and occasionally dangerous fieldwork. This is the belief that we could be like Marlin and just get gym or other militaries to do are fighting for us. And this is a way in the minds of some people to reduce risk, but it actually increases risks because you were relying on other people whose interests are often times in crew incongruent with your own interests and not only don't have the capability to fight and do what you need to do, but oftentimes don't have the will to do it.

Speaker 2:          01:07:08       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:07:09       So he's saying this idea that we can just, hey, we'll just have the Iraqi's do it. Sounds like a good idea, right? Cause I don't want my guys to get hurt or killed. There's a problem with that. The problem is they can't do what we do. They can't do it as well as we do it. And they probably don't have the will to do it. Now, credit to the Iraqis right now they're moving through Missoula. They're getting after it there. They're heavily backed by American forces, but they're, they're taking the lead for sure. Hmm. So, but when we were in Ramadi, those guys didn't have the will that we had. They didn't, didn't mean as much to them. If you can believe that. I know it sounds crazy. We had a battalion of Iraqi soldiers to talking about this with life. We had a battalion of Iraqi soldiers, so 500 Iraqi soldiers that it come to Ramadi as to to help out in the fight.

Speaker 1:          01:07:59       They left, they abandoned, they quit a battalion of Iraqi soldiers. And here's the weird thing. The reason they brought this battalion in one, we needed more manpower. Number two, they were Sunni. So Ramadi was a Sunni city and bulk of the army at the time was Shia. So the, she is coming in and fighting in Ramadi. Sometimes the Sunni's would say, hey, hey, wait a second. Why these? She is in here. So the idea was to bring the Sunni's in to help. And the Sunni's got scared. This is the Sunni battalion got scared and left. And one of the reasons they said, well, it's an a Sunni city. I just said, wait, wait a second. That's the whole point. These are your people. These are other Sunni's that are getting murdered by insurgents. So it was just, it was a tough situation. And my point in saying that, and there's a whole, there's a whole nother discussion we could have on that. But the point is that in order to win that fight, we had to be on the ground. The Iraqi's were not going to do it by themselves. They were not going to. And that's what this fallacy is. Hey, that if we just direct other people to do it, yeah, then we'll be good to go. And we don't have to take any risk. Now again, how does that translate to what we do, you know, business. How's that translate to business? How does that translate to life? For me, it's real simple.

Speaker 3:          01:09:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:34       The important things that you gotta do. You gotta do the hard things that you gotta do you gotta do you know it? Okay, Tim Ferris, can we outsource some stuff? Yes, we can. Don't worry. Tim will outsource some stuff, but the important stuff you have to do, you gotta do it. Gotta do it yourself. If it really means something, you have to do it. You have to have the will and you have to make it happen. Because if I outsource something to somebody, if I say, hey, I really don't feel like reading this book. You know, I really feel like reading this book for the podcast, can you read this for me? Well, yeah, somebody's going to read it, but they're not gonna have my perspective on it and they're just going to give me some notes. I'm going to sit here and read them. Yeah, we're not going to get the product that we need because that's important.

Speaker 1:          01:10:24       I have to do the work myself. No one can. I can't outsource that piece. Can't do it. There's actually been, people have said like, Hey, I can read the books for you and give you notes. I'm like, Hey, I appreciate the offer. No, I got to read it. I gotta do the hard part. Yeah, yeah. Now you say trying to outsource that stuff. Echo Charles. No, no, no, no. Keep it in house for sure. The, the congruency of, of interest, you know, that's a big one because you can't even think that the person has the, the same interest in really. You both can think that, but just maybe in a different way. Especially when you're thinking creatively, like how you present this and what parts do you think are important are going to be slightly different. Even if the person has the same interest is it's going to be different.

Speaker 1:          01:11:06       Yeah. So then at the end of the day, when you expect a certain result, it's gonna be different. Yeah. We'll let yourself down. Yeah. You know, just somebody just wrote, cause we're Musashi, it's a giant book. And someone was highlight massage the other day and kind of took a picture of it and he said, you know, I wonder how close Jockos highlights are going to be to my highlights, exactly what they're going to close. They might even be right on maybe, but they might not be. And I can't say, hey bro, send me your book and your notes and then we'll do the podcast and I'm just going to cheat. Can't do that. Just like you can't say, Hey, you know what? Iraqi forces that aren't ready, that don't have the same, here's the big problem with the Iraqi forces at the time. The Iraqi forces at the time didn't have a vision of what their country could be like.

Speaker 1:          01:11:51       So think about that. We Americans, we had, we had inherently being from America, we have a vision of what freedom is like. We know what that is. Iraqi soldiers didn't know what that is. They thought, man, they lived under under Saddam for their whole lives. I mean, all the soldiers that we worked with lived under Saddam their whole lives. That's all they knew. So for them, we say, no, you're going to have freedom. They're like, oh yeah, I don't know what, what does that even mean? What does that mean? I don't know what that means. We're, we're thinking, Hey, don't worry. These guys will fight. They're going to fight for their freedom. They're going to fight for their Sunni brothers. They're going to fight for their Iraq. They're kind of like, we don't even know. They didn't even really have a good vision of what Iraq is.

Speaker 1:          01:12:30       Iraq is a country that we used to be underneath Saddam and now it's not. And we don't know what that means. We don't know what that looks like. We Americans had a vision of what that looked like. They didn't have it. So how are they going to fight for it? So to your point, they don't see what we see. They had a different opinion. So who's got to go on there and, and have, and who's gonna have the will to fight the answers us in that particular case. And it's the same thing right now. Like even in Missoula, even in the last time when Ramadi was taken back by, by the Iraqi forces. Good, good on them. Props to the Iraqi forces. Right now they're backed up by Americans. Americans are, are saying, hey look, this is the vision. This is what you're going to do.

Speaker 1:          01:13:12       This is how we're going to take this part of it. And that is the big difference of why they didn't have the will. They didn't understand what they were fighting for. And you take anybody and put them in that situation. You don't even look at Vietnam War, right? You could. The Vietnam War are our American soldiers. Some of them you can go watch interviews. You know, they were saying, I don't know what I'm fighting for. Yeah. Hey, they were actually questioning, I don't know what, we know what America's like anymore. Right. Who's really reading, reading this book by Jim Thompson, you know, longest held pow ever. And when he got back, he was kind of, when he got back to America, he knew he was gone from 1964 until 1973 when he got back, when he left, America was fairly conservative in and patriotic. When he gets back, people are burning flags, people are protesting.

Speaker 1:          01:14:05       He was taken aback by it. And so, so if you took somebody that for Vietnam in 1970 in America's in turmoil and all that, it's hard to have the same vision that they'd had in 1964 which is like, Hey America, we're going to go stop the communists. Communists are bad, communists are bad. But then you start having the American Socialist Party that Tony, you that communist are good. And all of a sudden the kids over there going, hey look, I don't even know what's going on but I'm not sure I want to die here in this jungle. And that's problematic. And it's the same thing with, with the Iraqi soldiers. They just didn't know what they were fighting for. If you asked them what they were fighting for, they might say a paycheck. You. Very few of them would say, I'm fighting for a free and stable Iraq.

Speaker 1:          01:14:52       The very few of them, some of them fought against truly heartfelt fought against the insurgents. They didn't like the insurgents. Insurgents were murdering people and raping women and torturing people. They didn't like that. Then they'd fight hard against them, but that wasn't, not everyone experienced that. Not everyone saw that. Yeah, and I'm sure they're kind of like, you can tell him what you're fighting for, you know? And they can answer you for sure. You don't feel, it's like, you know, like your dad tells you when you're young, you dead tells you, hey, clean your room. I want this room spick and span like you don't get it. Yeah. All I'm going to take this whole meth. I'm just going to put it in the closet just so he'll stop, leave me alone kind of thing. You know? And then meanwhile, the Dad, your dad has this vision is like, look what's up with you?

Speaker 1:          01:15:41       Why didn't you clean your room? Don't you understand kind of thing. Yup. No, you don't. You don't understand that. Your Dad's trying to teach you that discipline equals freedom. My kids were running late this morning going to school. Why are they running late? Cause their rooms are messy. It w you're running late. Everything stressful now when we're heading to school. Why is that? Well, because you're, your room is messy. Lack of discipline, lack of discipline causes mental stress. Mental stress is not freedom. Yeah. But to your point, even trying to explain to the Iraqi soldiers why they're doing what they're doing on a really big level like that is difficult is difficult. Now occasionally you get a good leader. There was some, there was some good leaders. There was one of the generals that the Delta platoon commander worked with. He was a good dude. He was a good leader and, and the Delta platoon commander actually had some really good Iraqi scouts as well that really believed in what they were doing.

Speaker 1:          01:16:36       And I know that be the reason I differentiate a little bit. The Delta platoon commander worked very consistently with the same guys, a bunch as, as Lafe was working with multiple different groups. So the Delta platoon commander had some more tight relationships with some of those guys lifted too. But anyways, some of those guys understood what they were fighting for, but it's hard to, just like you said, explain what freedom is. And the other piece of it is in the, in those situations, explaining what freedom is, is no guarantee at all, right? That freedom is coming your way. These guys had been through so much turmoil that country has been through so much turmoil there. Like, Hey, you know what? We don't even know. You can promise us that but doesn't seem like we're doing too well. How do we know you're going to win? How do we know we're going to win? We don't know that. So you know what? I'm going to lay low. You see where this thing falls and then all they don't step up once I know who's going to win. Tough next, the RSVP fallacy. Thank you for the kind invitation to the war, but the United States regretted, is unable to attend. This is the belief that you can just opt out of war. It's a narcissistic approach to war, which we define w only war in relation to us and what we'd like to do.

Speaker 1:          01:18:03       So this idea that you can just be opt out doesn't work. The, the, the, the bottom line there is that you gotta get in the game, the game's going to take place, the game's going to happen and you're going to be affected by it. That's the key point. It's not a game that takes place on a field. It's a game that takes place on a field and expands out the crowd into the stands and into town and still scars. Stuff starts getting burned. Yeah. And riots take place. So you have to get in the game.

Speaker 1:          01:18:40       That was the, that was the fourth fallacy of worn out. I think that all those really show, not just how smart McMaster is, but also how open minded to yes. Which is a very important quality. I also think he's a realist. He's a realist and looks at things in a very real way. You know, this is the, what's happening and this is what we needed to do to deal with it. And also what's great about McMaster is that he is not afraid to speak his mind and he's got kind of got in trouble for that along the way. So I'm definitely looking forward to seeing how McMaster handles all the challenges that are ahead of him right now, not only in DC but in the world. So it's going to be an interesting and we wish him or I certainly wish him the best of luck in that pursuit.

Speaker 1:          01:19:46       So leading off of little McMaster, and I'm thinking about going to a little Q and a at this time. Sure. It's been a little while since we did Q and a here. Yeah, I've been doing Facebook live. Can you tell? Yeah. And what I've been doing Facebook live, I have not, I, I'm purposely not preparing at all. That's my goal. My goal is to not prepare at all because in the second or the, yeah, it was the second one that I did. I started looking at the questions ahead of time and I was saying, okay, well maybe we'll just take a couple notes here. And all of a sudden I started preparing for Facebook live and then I realized if I'm going to prepare, I'll make it the podcast. So No, don't prepare Facebook live. Ask me your question and I'll answer it there on the spot.

Speaker 1:          01:20:34       It's fun. It's different, right? It's easier. I can't do two podcasts a week because don't have time to prepare for him, but can do Facebook live. You can slide that thing in. Does it preparing for a live thing with the dynamics of Facebook live. Doesn't that defeat the live kind of purpose in a way it does. But we could do this podcast on Facebook live so we could prepare it and we could put it on Facebook live. We could do that, but then it would be a rehash of what we're doing. And the other piece of it is, is I think the Facebook live is a way of people seeing a little bit more of me as a normal human being and not me as a guy with all the answers on stuff like, no, you asked me a question, I don't really know. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          01:21:32       And, and also, you know, obviously on this podcast is, is usually pretty serious. And so I'm not like that all the time. So maybe they could say, well, I, I have a serious side, no doubt. Sure. But am I like that all the time? Yeah. So I think Facebook live is a good way to say, and plus, I don't want to answer some questions here, B, for a couple of reasons. Number one, man, when somebody listened to the podcast, I want to make sure they're getting something of high quality, right? Not, not just some fluff, right? Yeah. We're not doing fluff here. If we need to do fluff on the podcast, we just won't do the podcast because I don't, I don't want to somebody to press play and waste time. Oh, you know what I mean? Yeah. I don't mind fluffing around and talking smack on Facebook live because it's, that's what it is.

Speaker 1:          01:22:27       It's an open forum. We're going to have some fun. We're going to get after it a little bit, but it's not going to be super heavy because if you want that come here, get your podcast on. Yup. Yes, kind of more lightened up a little bit. Yeah. It's not like that's, it is not like I said, okay. Hmm. Let's see. I need to show them my light side. No, but if you talk to me live, it's like when Jody came on, Jody came on like after we were hanging out for like an hour. He's like, yeah man, when I was coming down I just thought you're going to be like full on cycle the whole time I was like, yeah, I'm not falling cycle the whole time. If we're eating a burger, we're good. I'm not going to be sitting there while I'm eating a burger St. Let me tell you what, no, I didn't want to do that when I'm eating a burger, when I enjoyed that Burger.

Speaker 1:          01:23:15       It makes sense. But yeah, if it's a live Q and a, you know how like at like the muster or you know when you guys, okay we're going to do some Q and. A. That's the example of like a live Q and. A. You don't prepare for those questions. You know, and, and, and, and also what's interesting about those questions is those, I've given some, I mean, if you think about any of the podcasts that I've gone on, Tim Ferriss', Joe Rogan, Sam Harris, the, those, those guys ask me some heavy questions, right? Those guys weren't just asking me, we weren't just be guessing right. During those. So there's no guarantee that I'm not going to get, get a little bit serious on your Facebook live or whatever I'm going to do. I'm gonna do what people ask me. Right? Yeah. But

Speaker 4:          01:24:00       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:24:01       yeah. During the muster, who we do a lot of Q and a during the muster, we get all kinds of questions. There's some really funny questions at Reus Choir, funny responses. There's also some, some real serious ones that require very serious answers. And what's interesting, and this happens on Twitter to, somebody asks me something dead serious question, like a very serious, you know, something that's emotional to me, like about losing guys or, or something like that. Guys killed in combat and I'll, I'll respond to it. And then two tweets later, someone says, you know, I'm going to have some mint chocolate chip ice cream tonight. You know what I mean? And so you go through these. If someone's read, they must think I'm schizophrenia because I'm answering real serious. Then it's real light. And then it just kind of weird, Eh, rollercoaster math. Yeah, it's an emotional rollercoaster on the Twitter. Oh Lord. All right. So Q and a Qa Echo Charles back in the game. Back in the game. So yeah, first question Jocko, an echo, should you defend bad leaders? It your superiors to your man. Think about that question. This is a good, it's a good question. And we haven't done Q and a in a while. And that's why I want to start off thinking about that. Should you defend bad leaders that are people that are in charge of you? Should you defend them to your men? Now this is really a perfect example of the dichotomy of leadership.

Speaker 4:          01:25:34       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:25:36       And this is one of those situations that makes leadership very, very hard because it requires a nuanced balance to handle this correctly. So on the one hand, if we, if we,

Speaker 4:          01:25:53       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:25:53       say our boss is a bad leader and doesn't know what he's doing to figure out the boss, hey echo, our boss does know what he's doing. He's an idiot. We undermine his authority for sure and we undermine the authority of the whole chain of command. So should you call out when someone's sucks, you say, Oh that guy sucks. He's terrible. Should you do that to your leader? The answer is no. You can't do that. You can't do that cause you're undermining everything. So you've got a horrible leader. You can't just sit there to your boys and say, Hey, this guy's an idiot. Can't do that. However, if you give full support to this horrible boss, then your troops who know a good leader from a bad leader, they know what stupid and what doesn't. They know this, they know this. And if you are sitting there backing them 100% then they're going to know that you either actually agree with the bad leader, which is bad, or that you're too weak to stand up and say, hey boss, what we're doing is wrong, so you can't go to one extreme.

Speaker 1:          01:27:09       The boss is an idiot. You can't go to the other extreme. The is awesome. Think about how hard that is. Think about what I'm saying. This is a very, very challenging, so what can you do? Well, okay, first of all, as a subordinate leader, it is your duty to push back, right? To to say, Hey boss, I think we're doing the wrong thing here, and this is why we spend a lot of time trying to build relationships with our bosses so that we can have candid conversations with them, right? Sometimes it's hard to do that. It is, I understand, but when you have built a relationship, then you can go to your boss and say, Hey, look, this isn't, this isn't good. Now, once you've done that, then you can go to your, go to your book, your troops, and you say, hey look, I went to the bosses when I told him, you know, I told him that, hey, doing this method isn't gonna work.

Speaker 1:          01:28:04       Well, he explained to me while we're doing it, this is what he said. So this is why we're using this method. I know it's not popular with you guys, but it's, it's, here's the reason why we're doing it. So, so you made progress, right? Your guys are saying, okay, well he at least stood up to the man and now he gave us an answer. He told us why we're doing what we're doing. And so that's good too. But the other thing is when, the easiest way to do this is to provide an honest truth. Truth is going to be your friend here. Truth is going to be a friend. Now I should, I should put a caveat around that because the truth might be you think your boss is a complete idiot and everything he's saying is stupid. Okay, so I, I take it back. Don't use a full on truth. And this is so, this is so interesting too, because clearly truthfulness is a huge, you know, it's a value that I've hold very dear, right? And you gotta be truthful and all that. I'm telling you right now, do not

Speaker 1:          01:29:01       be true. If you think your boss is an idiot and you think the method that he's picking or the plan, he's got his stupid, don't be truthful your guys and go down there and say, Boston did. He is not going to help your team, right? We have to be smart about what we're doing. But when you, when you do that, what you need to do is to keep it somewhere in the middle. Okay? So when you say something negative, don't get all crazy with the negative. Don't get all nuts with a negative. What you want to do is say, you say something like, Hey, look, I'm sure there's some better ways of doing this, but this is the decision that was made and we need to make it work, right? So I'm not saying it's horrible and to say, look, hey guys, I'm sure to some better ways, but guess what?

Speaker 1:          01:29:47       This is what we are being told to do right now and we're going to do the best we can notice that I'm putting it from like them to know we are making, I'm taking ownership of it. This is now ours to execute. Yeah. So you want to do that and, and I also want to focus more on as much as I can. I want to focus on not the personality of the boss, but I want to focus on the what we're being told type thing or what the mission is because I don't want to bring, I want to keep the personality, the boss at bay. Sometimes you get a boss that has such a raging asshole personality that you have to say something like, you just, you have to explain. And that's when even then you want to ratchet it down a little bit. You don't say, Hey, the boss is an asshole.

Speaker 1:          01:30:30       You know the boss is an idiot. No, you don't say that. You know, you say, hey look guys, I know the bosses is not exactly perfect, but I think he means well with what he's trying to do and that way we need to focus for that reason. We need to focus on executing because not going to help us to sit here and complain about the boss. He might not have the greatest personality, but you know what? His intention is good, so let's support him. You know what I mean? Something like that where you're not, you're not giving him full support, but you're not completely throwing him under the bus. Again, this is so hard to do because let's face it, the boys, the troops, they know what's up. They know when that boss is an idiot. They know when he's unprofessionally. They didn't know when he treats you like shit.

Speaker 1:          01:31:15       They know that stuff. And so if you bow down, if you break and you give that to them, yes, you're right. The boss is a jerk. Yes, you're right. The boss treats people like shit. Yeah. If you give them that you're hurting the situation. And that's why also when you're in a leadership position, your job oftentimes is to buffer between the jerk boss and the boys. You don't, the boys should never know that the kind of stupid harassment that you get from your boss, the boys should never know that and they should think, hey, Jocko says this guy's good to go. We're good to go. There's never think that this guy's an idiot. So again, in both cases it's like you can't go hardcore. You can't go hardcore against either the plan or the person, but you also, at the same time, you need to give a little bit of a pressure release.

Speaker 1:          01:32:13       Just a little bit of a pressure release, you know, got to give them just enough that they go, you know what you want them to think. Do you want them to think, hey, Jocko gets it. He knows he's not admitting it to us and good on him. He's, he's keeping it professional. They know how they, they know that John [inaudible], they know I don't love the boss, but they know him keeping it professional. So therefore they, they accept what I'm saying and they stay part of the team. Yeah. It kind of feels like, I'm kind of imagining myself as one of the boys. Oh, you're my boss in re we don't really like your boss. Right. I feel like, sure. If I was made to feel better in whatever way, just a little bit better, that pressure release. I said just a little bit better about the mission.

Speaker 1:          01:33:04       Okay. And I trust you because of how you always handle things or whatever. You know what? All right. It's not the best funnest, whatever. It's not my first choice, but at least we're doing it together. You know, I trust you and all right, let's do this kind of thing. And one of the key things you just said is trust. So if you trust me and the boss is saying to do something completely ridiculous, and I come down and say, Echo, guess what we're going to do? We're going to, we're going to dig this hole and then we're going to fill it back in. I want to do it six times today. Let's get to work. And you know it's stupid and I come down and try and sell that to you without any explanation with that voice, that voice, I'm going to lose trust. You're not going to trust me as much.

Speaker 1:          01:33:47       Now, if I come down and say, hey, hey boys, hey, bringing in, this is what's going on. Yeah. See, I'm going back to another voice here. Going back to the leadership, I said, hey guys, here's what's going on. I know this is going to come across as a strange task. We're going to get it done. We got to dig these holes. I know where to fill them back in and we're actually going to do this six times today. Again, I know it's not exactly what we were planning to do today, but look, let's get after it. Let's get it done and let's prove to everybody that we can make this happen faster than and all of a sudden were wherever you were going to get after it. You know what I mean is no factor. Whereas again, if I go into like a Dorky nerd voice and try and say, we are going to do this because it's the best plan ever, I'm losing trust with you.

Speaker 1:          01:34:28       I'm actually hurting my trust. So this is a really, really nuance thing. And my best advice here is to try and keep it in the middle, right? Trying to be, and I'll tell you, probably lean a little bit, lean towards being professional. Lean towards supporting the chain of command because, because the guys are going to know when you give them that little little pressure relief when you say, Hey, I know this is, this is a little bit of a strange plan. As soon as I say that, if it was like, okay, he understands working with, I know we'll do whatever he says, Hey Jocko.

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       Okay Jock, we get it. You gotta you gotta you gotta have us do this. Cool, let's do it. Yeah. It's when I come down and say, hmm. And again the, you'll realize that this is, this is the opposite. I see all the time. You know, if you come down and say the boss's plan, we got to do this. I always throw that as like the worst possible leadership is, hey, we got to do this because we were told to do it. That's the worst possible leadership. Not saying to do that. What I'm saying is a little pressure relief. Just a little pressure relief of, hey look, I threw up a different plan. I thought my plan was a little bit better. Boss came up with this, this idea, we're going to go for it. It's close enough. Just something like that. Just like, I know, I know.

Speaker 5:          01:35:37       Dig It. Yeah, that's it. A little, let's give him a little, a little nugget. Yeah. I feel like I would feel if you were to be like, this is such a dumb plan and I don't know why we got to do it or whatever. I'd be like, wait, wait. Then why are we doing that? Then my like, why are we doing it? Then you know, and I wouldn't want to do that. No. So yeah, it's like right in the middle of there. It's leaning towards being professional. It's leaning towards supporting the chain of command with just enough of a pressure relief too to have them say, I'll tell you a story. It's cool. This is real, real quick. This was in the take your time. I want you to tell me the longest store. We're going back to ninth grade through high school, College. It's weird that I even thought of this.

Speaker 5:          01:36:16       So we, we, you know how like in in class, right, this high, early high school, freshmen, you know in class they're like, hey, get into groups, we're going to do this thing. And um, so we got into these groups and we did some project little thing during class. We're done halfway through glass, we're done and we're about to present. The teacher looks at it and it was like, oh, you guys got to do it again. But the teacher didn't tell everyone. She tells me this one girl, Marla is her name come Marla. So Marla comes back from talking to the teacher and she's like, she was kind of the leader. No one desi. But she, at that point, she was kind of the little leader that liaison between the group and the teacher. So she comes back, she like, cause like we gotta do it again and were, and everyone was like, what?

Speaker 5:          01:37:01       She goes, we gotta do it again. Like you could tell she hit accepted it, but just her being like sighing kind of demonstrated that a, she feels the pain too. I dig it, but hey guys, you know, we're not going to complain right now. Let's just that little subtle thing. But that's exactly what it did. It kind of, it basically accepted the order that none of us really wanted to hear. But at the same time she demonstrated that, hey, she feels it too, you know, and let's do what we did again of course and whatever. I don't even know what grade we had. Got an a plus, I'm sure Marlo work working her leadership skills. It was weird that, I mean, I don't know necessarily that she intended to do that, but that was the exact effect. And you can, thinking back, I can see the elements, you know, the little pressure release was her not saying don't talk to me like dad. She said we gotta do to get, you know, she didn't like oppose anybody heard, just heard little shit, mannerisms. You know what she didn't do? She didn't jump completely on board the teacher. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       And be like we gotta do this again. It sucked. No, she was like, hey look we've got would have to do this again. You know what I mean? She just hated it enough. And I'll say this, this question, I'm surprised it took so long to get this question because this is a really, really good question and it also is a incredibly important skill to be able to walk this line. And it's tricky to do and it's, it's, it's sort of, this might be one of the, this is like the type of thing that helped me a lot in when I was in the teams was just being able to do this enough cause you get have to do some dumb shit teams man. And you know what it's like. Okay. Being able to translate a stupid, something stupid and give enough pressure relief too to make guys not just go jock was just, you know, company guy, right?

Speaker 1:          01:38:49       He's a company guy. He look, he just lives. Oh he doesn't stand up for us. No, actually I do. But this is, you know, like lifestyle. Tell him that story about doing paperwork when I'm like, no, we're going to do all the paperwork. I went, I held the company line. But like in such a dynamic or her such an overboard way that guys are like, okay, yeah we're going to win. This is a competition. So that's good times. Yeah. It's like a meat cause it seems like okay. All that paperwork, it's, it's almost like the paperwork was like in a front dude's like, Hey, what the US against them kind of thing where it told us to do the paperwork and you were like, yeah, and we're, yeah, exactly. You know, so it's like you take it to the, that's something I'd done. I've actually done that a fair amount.

Speaker 1:          01:39:32       I talked about the story before, but like an officer candidate school, every little stupid rule that they threw at us, I did it to the nth degree and had everybody in that class to the nth degree where they were just going, yeah, yeah. Going ballistic. So a story like that where we're just going, we're just going to take what's there, take the order, and carried out to the extreme and take pride in doing that. That was another little tactic that I use by me along the way. Yeah, we're going to do that. We're going to do, it's so hard. You're not even know what your name was. That's another tactic you can take for sure. They want us to Polish these boots. They want us, they want us to clean this thing. We'll do it. Watch this.

Speaker 1:          01:40:08       All right. Next question. Six question Jocko. Has there been a situation in which you took something to personally? How do you avoid taking things personally? So the initial reaction is like, no man, I don't take things too personally. You don't want to keep to, but the actual factors. Yeah, I take, I take everything personally, right? Like, I mean I, if I do something bad, I am very personally, I don't like it at all. If I do something poorly, I don't like it at all. I take it very personally. If somebody gives me feedback, I take it personally. This is like, it's an ego thing. It's a pure ego thing. Right? And I just had to say this at a group I was talking to just because I say ego is bad all the time. He goes good to egos. What drives you? Eagle is what makes you want to be number one.

Speaker 1:          01:40:56       Yeah. Ego is what is, it brings you pride in your work and makes you work harder to give, deliver good product and and be a good leader and a good employee and a good person. Right? That's ego. The problem comes when ego or taking things personally actually prevents you from listening to the critiques that you're being told. That's, that's the problem. So, for instance, we'll take this little podcast right here that's got some critique on it. The other day I got somebody, somebody sent me a little critique and they said that I didn't explain cause we had Andy Stumpf on here and Andy was kind of rattling off that has his career in the teams and he's, he was rattling off the career and the teams, he lost some people, not a bunch because it wasn't that complicated, but he lost some people. And, and for instance, he used an, an an an acronym, um, or an acronym Lpl, which stands for leading petty officer, which is the, which is the second senior enlisted person in a seal platoon.

Speaker 1:          01:42:00       And I didn't explain that when he said it. So there's an example. So when I heard this, my first reaction is like, oh, you don't know what Lpl is called, gold. Google, go Google it. Why are you asking me? Oh Bryce, just stop talk. And then that was pretty much, you know, my, my ego was saying, hey, I can't believe this person doesn't dare you. How dare you? As I thought about, I was like, well, you know, I need to, I need to make sure in the future that I'm more than, I'm more aware of what guys are talking, especially when I'm sitting here talking to it, another seal who we have a common language and we are talking about things in very conversational mode. So we're not caring about anybody else. And that's sort of what the podcast is often is like we're not, we're not talking to everyone that's listening at this moment.

Speaker 1:          01:42:45       We're just kind of talking to ourselves or amongst ourselves. And so when he throws out this words, I need to be more aware of them. So if I took it personally, I might not listen to, if I actually listen, I can do a better job. So that's, that's kind of it. And basically that's the same with anybody. When anybody receives any criticism of any kind, they get, they take it personally. And I think the thing is two things. Number one, get over it so you can listen to what the criticism is in. And also remember this, this is kind of weird, I think maybe I'm wrong. What do you think the more angry and the more personally you take some criticism, the truer it actually is. Is that possible? When something really bothers you, it's probably something that really bothers you because you know it's true. Like when somebody says something that just doesn't matter to me it, it's, you know, I don't take it personally. Oh they just think that don't

Speaker 5:          01:43:52       worry about it. I'm not worried about it. But when somebody says something that I know is true and they're pinging me on it, that's means I get even more, take it more personally and get more angry about it. And, and then that should be an indicator, hey, this is something you actually need to fix. It actually has to do with insecurity more than anything. So it can be, it can be super true or it can be kind of true or you can just be questioning whether or not it's true. If you're insecure about it, that's when it's going to, cause you can be like, there can be, okay. You know, let's say guys have a receding hairline and they're like, oh, I don't, I don't care about that at all. It's totally true. You know, and, or let's say I do care about it. I don't like it, but I, I've known it for the last time I was 20 years, whatever.

Speaker 5:          01:44:32       And someone's like, Hey, you know, you're hairline's receding to care about that. I don't, I don't think they know. I don't know of any, but I'm just saying certain things. Um, and if you know about it or you know, and you know it's true and c, you won't necessarily be bothered, but, but if you get someone who's like, it's starting to recede or early on or it's like Dang. And they won't necessarily be, this is just an example, hypothetical, but they won't necessarily be concerned about the actual hairline receding. They're more concerned about, oh, do I look older and my unattractive now, or am I losing it now? Or something like that. That's what they're insecure about. So when someone points out some symptom of that insecurity, that's when they're like, well, you don't go to say that. Are, you know, they get all mad and that goes for kind of anything.

Speaker 5:          01:45:17       So maybe, I dunno, maybe it's someone saying, hey, you didn't explain this enough. Maybe you're like, wait, what do you say? Was that a junk episode kind of thing? Or, or something like, did I not, um, you know how you, you're good at explaining stuff and simplifying them or whatever. Maybe it was like a, an attack ad or something. He's a personal point of pride. Yeah. Yeah. You know? Exactly. I don't know, but maybe, but that's typically what people get mad about. It's not necessarily if they know it's true or not. It's if they're insecure about it. Right. Well, you wouldn't be insecure about something that wasn't true. He was a thing. But sometimes you do, cause you know, sometimes it's like a weird, like mental, uh, like problem. But you know, girls for example, I'm not saying all girls, but listen, I'm going to totally generalize right now. But you know, the girl was like, Hey, do I look fat in this? The girls I can awesome shape or whatever. And you're like, ah, or worse. They always think they're fat, that it's not true. That's not the response by the world.

Speaker 5:          01:46:13       That's a perfect example though. You know what I mean? So it's like that kind of stuff. You know, people are just insecure about stuff sometimes. Oh, and even though the girls are in really good shape or, or, or even guys when especially like if they're into like their physique or something like that were, I dunno, they're at a party or so I've heard guys like they go to parties and they'll do like dips or pushups before they walk in. Cause like, so they're like more pumped. Aye, I swear. And is that why you're doing some push ups?

Speaker 5:          01:46:46       You know what I mean? So like you were just a little insecure about what I have said anyway. You know, they'll get that kind where there'll be like, oh I'm, they'll think that, oh, I'm not looking very cut up or something like that. You know, like that kind of stuff when it's not true. Yeah. Yeah. No, I think, I think that's a good point. And I think the bottom line is when we take things personally, I think it's actually not a negative thing because it means that you're, there's probably something that you need to work on. But I think what we need to watch out for is taking it personally and therefore being mad and either be mad at the person that told you which the person probably could be out aligned, you know, saying some stuff that's offensive. But even if someone offends you, well, okay, well let's fix it so you don't have that, that, that weakness or that insecurity anymore.

Speaker 5:          01:47:40       And so just know what your red flags are. No, when you're taking somebody's, everybody take stuff. Personally, I'm like Mister detachment and I take so personally all the time. When somebody says something to me, I'm like, oh, okay, why don't I go when I do to do better, do good job with seeing the big picture though. You know, like, cause a lot of times, you know, when I always think back to the, you know, the, the relationship like okay, let's say, let's say I'm at home, I'm mowing the lawn, I did all this, these great housework, chores, whatever. You know, dad comes home, mom comes home and they're like, hey, I thought I told you to take out the trash. Meanwhile everything else is spic and span. So I'm like, I'm mad. You know, how dare you say that to me when I did this?

Speaker 5:          01:48:23       Me, me, my thing, my thing. But at the same time, they're right. You know, so you do a good job of like, you'd be able to kind of recognize that even though you'd probably feel those same things. You won't, your default isn't wounded. We'll do it and fight back and make the problem bigger. It's kind of like you'll feel it on the inside and recognize the red flags, what's happening and you go, Oh yeah, I'll kill her. But I got to remember to take all the tress because the truth is, that's correct. That is correct. It doesn't matter if you did the lawn or not. The trash was a thing, you know, so yeah. Yeah, you did good job of recognizing that part. I think a lot of times in our case we don't do such a good job. No, I'm going to throw this out there.

Speaker 5:          01:49:04       This is a little off subject, but it just made me think of it. I was talking to Dave at the gym yesterday and he was listening to the podcast and he, he lost his, he lost his dad. Yeah. And like six months ago and he was listening to a clip from the podcast of me basically saying, hey, because someone asked what good comes from when someone dies and he, he said, look, you covered a lot of stuff. And it was super powerful and it was, was very helpful. And he said, but there's a one more thing. He said, there's one more thing that has come from my dad's death that it's good. And I said, what? And he said it was

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       like a slap in the face of go out and, and get after it. You know, and I kind of left that out and I've, I've talked to other people and clearly, you know, when you lose someone that's close to you and see the reason, I guess the reason that I didn't think of this is because in the teams you kind of like, you guys get killed, you know, and we all kind of already live with the feeling of, hey man, I mean, I say it all the time. I'm going to live the best life I can. But for someone in the civilian sector, and they haven't had any, any, they haven't lost anyone day, haven't had anyone died close to them. They get the feeling that many of us, many people walk through through the world with of I'm going to live forever. You know, I'm not going to die.

Speaker 1:          01:50:35       And I got all the time, I've got time. And so he made this great point. He said, you know, for me, when my dad died, he's, you know, he's in his mid twenties and he's been kind of, you know, I don't want to say the word relaxing, but he's been, you know, fairly crude. He's been cruising kind of, and he's, he realized he can't, he can't do that, you know, he needs to, he needs to get after it. So cool. Cool story. Cool feedback. I thought I should let everybody know. That's another good thing. When w if you lose someone and you, you're not accustomed to that and you don't see how precious life is, cause a lot of the times it's pretty easy. Forget, it's pretty easy to forget how precious it is when, when it's right there, when it's given to you, you know, it's, it's like food.

Speaker 1:          01:51:22       It's pretty easy to forget how mean how precious was the, was the crappy loaf of French bread with sticks and bugs in it that Colonel Rita got, we got to the prison camp and Hanoi and that was precious. And you know what, even colonel reader, three weeks later he was like, oh, this, that bread. Even, he's here, he's laughing. He's like, that bread sucked. I was like, sir, here you said it was like the best thing you've ever had. He goes, well it wasn't first. So we all get, we all get this attitude that you know, hey, this is always going to be here. Well it's not always going to be here so don't, don't treat it like it is taking that for granted, you know, next question. Hi Jocko.

Speaker 5:          01:52:02       I'm being told in Jujitsu that I'm using too much strength to execute techniques and dominating roles. I get after it in the gym and try to be stronger and fitter. All were already limit my strength against same weight training partners and definitely don't pull, don't bull rush or overpower lighter partners. I want to improve my Jujitsu knowledge and understand the intent of reducing my strength and uh, it reduces my strength to learn the skill. But where, where's the balance? I feel like I feel like I'm doing uh, being penalized for working hard and being strong and there has to be an element of strength. Two technique right

Speaker 1:          01:52:43       now that I'm trying to do zero strength working week positions and they still go 100% on me. I'm not learning anything. Right. What he's asking, what is, what is my 25% stronger than my training partners? 100% of trained Nogi for four years. But Gee only for 12 months. Don't judge the white belt warrior. Okay. So you know, I don't think anyone is saying use zero strength, right. It just be a or used to have a uh, kids in the kids class that would just like flop around like the use. No, they'd be like noodles. You know, especially when you're a partner and I say, Hey, don't be that. So no one's telling you to use zero strength. That's not the, that's not the, the goal here. You just want to use less strength and I'm the same way, man. I work out so I can be strong and when we're rolling, if I have to use strength, I'm going to use it.

Speaker 1:          01:53:39       You bench pressed me off off you the other day from across side wall technique. Can you even claimed it at the time? That's all weight, so, so that's good. Right? And, and you, you used it cause you had to use it, you are going to get punished and you're like, oh no, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna have Jocko across aside, discerning in the role. So boom. Got Bench press or watching too, by the way. So, so yeah, we, we want to be strong for sure. But I'll tell you, this is the music, the key thing when I'm going to train with someone, I'm going to use just enough skill and strength to stay slightly ahead of him just enough. I'm not trying to crush them.

Speaker 1:          01:54:22       If someone's, and it'll tell you if someone's a way lighter than me then, but they have kind of equivalent skill, then I'm going to try and limit my strength as much as I can. So it's a Jujitsu versus a Jujitsu for sure. But I'm definitely gonna use my strength if needed for really, for a couple reasons. The first reason is because of ego. Sure. Right. I don't want to tab, I want to get caught in a bad position. I don't like that. Yeah. If you call, if you train, like when we're done training there, I'm definitely using strength cause I'm dripping with sweat, right? I mean I'm using physical attributes, but that's not the only reason. The other reason that you have to use your strength sometimes is you don't want to give people the false sense of security that a, that worked. Right. Even your good training partners, like you don't want to say, oh the guy gets a position so you just tap, right?

Speaker 1:          01:55:13       Because he's in a competition or in the street. The person is not just going to tap, they need to do it. Right. So that's it. I guess the bottom, the bottom line is, my guess is is this dude is probably using too much strength. He's probably one of those guys that's naturally really strong, man. He works out and he's thinking, I've been trained in Nogi for four years. So now when I put this guy on, man, I'm angry about it because I'm falling behind a little bit. So I'm gonna use some strength. Yeah. I would say man, just try it. Try and relax and just

Speaker 5:          01:55:44       one of my favorite pieces of advice to give relaxed Harger this, relax, try and flow when you roll a little bit and it definitely will make you, it'll make you better in the end. The more you relax the the, the more the better you'll get at the end. And certain, I found that like certain guys, that's just, they're just their method really just strong. Yeah. And that's how they roll and they're just aggressive physically. That's how, and I found that they can, a lot of times they can get more technical, but really that's kind of their, their strengths in a way. And that's, it's just their way of ruling and some guys in the opposite, what now that you mention it, there's some people that are like that. They have like an on and off switch then either all on or they're just super docile.

Speaker 5:          01:56:35       Yeah. It's almost like got to find that middle ground if you can. If you can't. But people are different. Like let's say like remember Franklin mistruths phrase lexical at crazy. Okay. Consider him where he's going to be real technical and flexible and flowy and stuff. And that's his Jujitsu. You can, he can, I need to be more strong and rigid and aggressive. He can train that. But his default is that flowy, flexible way. And, and guys who are like this, I think that's going to be kind of their default. They can train kind of deviate a little bit and get it more for sure. But that's kind of just there. That's the vehicle they have, you know, and uh, it's, it's almost like a genetic thing. It's not genetic but it's, it's kind of, it's almost like the foundation of their Franklin was a trip to roll with because he was so flexible but not just in a normal way.

Speaker 5:          01:57:27       You know what his is flexible and his, his spine was like when you put your weight on him and he would just like, like jelly fish. Yeah. It was like an octopus. It's exactly what I was like. Well she kept training man. He was so good. That's all. I'm pretty not too long ago. Yeah, he's trained at like occasionally. Yeah. He, he was getting good for awhile. Yeah. It really feel good though. Still good. Um, but yeah, it's kind of, it's more of a mental thing. Like if you mentally, there's drills like you can do you remember? Um, Jerry allowed in was his name. He jammed into the needs but we used to do this thing. He's like, Hey, let's just flow. Right. And you know how people say, let's just look, so then they're trying to kill you. He wouldn't though. He would be like, his flow would be like a fast pace and you could even try to hold them down and, and he just be like falling flat employee.

Speaker 5:          01:58:14       He would get you in a good position and they need to get right out of it into another, you know, like he was really good at flowing to the point where you get kind of tired because you're moving so much. It's not full speed flow. It's almost full speed though. So I remember doing that a lot with him and it really translated when I would roll, it would be like, I felt like that difference in technique. That's really good. I, I do. I always do a warm up run with Andy. Like that would just go position possess. We were going, but we're going like, you know, we're just go flowing. Yeah, that sounds, I don't like the word, but that's what it is. I mean, that's what it is. Don't ever do that with dean. No, I'm serious. Don't ever, no, don't ever say listened to him.

Speaker 5:          01:58:58       Say like, Hey, let's just get warmed up because he's not going to do that. He's going to flow until he's in a good position that he's going to smash. You said don't do it. You have to just go hard. Good. Yeah. Yeah. And he's real good at that stuff too, but that's a good way though. Like if you, yeah, that's a good way. That's a good way. If you can see that's a good, I see what you're saying. That's a good way to learn to relax more. Yes. Yes. When that becomes more common because, let's face it, I mean if you're strong and you're going into roles and people, if to the point where people were saying, hey, you're, you're using too much strength from him, you're getting, if you're hearing that from multiple people, there's an issue. Man. That's my point is even though you're saying, well saying, hey, some people are just that way, don't accept that.

Speaker 5:          01:59:43       Like who the guy that asks this question don't accept echos thing of saying some people just that way because that means you're just going to keep doing it and you to get better because he will. The more you relax, the better you get. Yeah, for sure, and of course I don't mean it like that. I know. Yeah, no, I know you don't, but I'm saying like don't get that miss conception that that's what Aco is trying to say. Hey, you're just that way. Go with it. No, don't go with it. Listen to what echo is saying when he's saying, hey, find somebody to flow, roll with and just let it flow. It's going to be rare. You find a person who's kind of default method is this. And then by the way, I just realized I don't say flow role cause I was thinking about when I say to Andy or we don't say it anymore, we just do it.

Speaker 5:          02:00:23       But I used to write, hey let's a get a warm up round as I call him a warmup. Okay. Hello role. But sometimes not along. Sometimes it's just like a technique sharpener have. Let's see. He does do it. Say does do some flow rolling drills and gets better at it. I would, I would guess that there is going to be a significant remainder of his game that's going to be this aggressive game. Oh for sure. For sure. Yeah. Homes is aggressive on the mat for sure. Another little mindset that might help is think less competitively cause you know how like a lot of people from there and really it's true though. He, here's the thing, this, this element needs to be there where it, when it's time to, to spar, it should be competitive. Otherwise it's like what are we doing? You know, I want to know if I want you to be competitive because I want an accurate look of what it's like to roll with Jocko or a guy like Jocko, big, strong, good at Jujitsu, whatever.

Speaker 5:          02:01:24       If you're just flow rolling with me and non competitively every single time I'm not getting the work done I need no, that's what I was talking about earlier too is that's why you go, yeah, yeah, yeah. You got to use strength. Yeah. So it should be competitive, but if some, if people are complaining you're going too hard, you're going straight up. Like every role is ADCC. Yeah. On the line. Life or death, you know, kind of more in that direction. The Mood Giles, snare. So if you think maybe less of that and understand that this is, this is training. If you want to get less using strengths, they'll pay. You got to kind of train that stuff. I like it. The middle. The next question. Next question Jocko. I need some advice. If you've got time, we've got time. What's a good course of action when someone lies, betrays trust or just plain destroys you?

Speaker 1:          02:02:17       Move on, straight up, move on, forget them. They are lying and they are untrustworthy. So move on. Now sometimes this can be hard, especially if they've somehow tied themselves into your life. Especially like for instance, you get the kids involved in a divorce scenario. You, you can't move on, but you have to mentally move on. You have to emotionally detach from that human and that's hard to do because obviously they were someone that you trusted. It'd be. And the reason I know that you trusted them is because they got to a point where they were able to betray your trust and destroy you. So they, they, it's hard. But the fact that they trust that you trusted them, the fact that you had that relationship, that's even more reason to walk away. It's even more reason to move on. You got to see them for what they are. And this is an important piece right here. This is an important cause. This is something I learned as a young lad out there in the world. That person is not who you thought they were, right? They are not who you thought they were. The idea that this person

Speaker 2:          02:03:51       okay,

Speaker 1:          02:03:52       was a trustworthy, faithful companion is not true. It is not true. That person does not exist. They didn't exist and they don't exist. It was in your head. It was in your head that this person was trustworthy and you the, they were everything you wanted them to be and they were faithful, commanded. That is a lie. They are not that person. They have proved it. They've proved it by their actions. So move on and at the risk of sounding callous, get over it.

Speaker 2:          02:04:32       Okay?

Speaker 1:          02:04:32       Get over it. Do not dwell. Do not dwell on, do not dwell on, on on what it was and don't dwell on what it could have been. You were year when guys go through bad breakups. You know it's, I just thought, well, you're going to, it's like, no, don't dwell on that. Deal with what it is right now. What that person is. Deal with reality except reality and be be thankful. Free Alley. Be Thankful that you were able to learn before you invested morale more than to this person. Be Beat. Be Thankful that you found out when you did that this person was a liar, that this person was unfaithful as untrustworthy beat. Be Thankful that you know it and you know it now instead of later. And you know what else is going to make it a lot easier to get over these situations is recognize that there's plenty of people out there in the world that are trustworthy and there are faithful good people there. They're out there. Go find one of them.

Speaker 4:          02:05:35       But

Speaker 1:          02:05:38       don't think that that person that you had was the only one in the world. They're not. And you know what if that I have sometimes, sometimes people have a hard time making that trust because they're so caught up and they, they, they don't want to meet someone else right away. That's fine. Start with yourself. Right? Rely on yourself. Trust yourself because we won. When someone breaks our trust, we, we, we question ourselves to yes, like we think are my judgments bad. I'm not a good judge of human character cause I totally put my faith in this person and look what they did to me. So now we don't trust her. So you've got to build that trust up. You got to build that trust up back again with yourself. How do you do that? Read.

Speaker 4:          02:06:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:06:20       Right. Learn workout. Be alone. It's okay to be alone so people get freaked out when they're alone. It's okay to be alone. It's okay. It's okay to be alone. There's no big deal. Enjoy it.

Speaker 4:          02:06:38       Okay?

Speaker 1:          02:06:38       Do something productive and build that trust up in yourself and you'll look back at the situation. Learn from it. We do that. It's an owl post operational debrief. Oh, you've put too much trust in somebody. Cool. They broke your heart. All right, Roger that. Let's see. What were the steps? What should I have recognized? How many times did I say? Well, you know, they didn't call me, but it's probably just because their phone was out of battery. No. Once your phone runs out of battery once, okay. You don't let it happen again, right? Yeah. So you start seeing those red flags to you, the mistakes that you made and then look for them next time around because you deal with people all the time that they made mistakes. The first run, they go back and they make the same mistakes. The second run they go back and make the same mistakes.

Speaker 1:          02:07:19       The third run. That's when you got to start blaming yourself on your situation. That's why, that's why I said you got to like build a relationship with yourself. You got to learn yourself. You've got to trust, you've got to learn to trust yourself, so spend some time doing that and then when you go back and you start dealing with people, because that's what, that's what you got to watch out for is that you become a hardened criminal. If you don't trust anybody, like you were talking about cops, you know sometimes cops have a hard time because they're dealing with scumbags all day long and it builds up this, this mistrust of other people. So you don't want to have that happen. You want to be suspicious of people, but you want to be able to build trust. Once they proved themselves. So take those small steps and start to build up over time.

Speaker 1:          02:08:08       Don't just jump in and give someone a hundred percent trust out of the gate. You don't know him. Don't know him. You know, back in the day, back in the day when old hardcore bands used to have this t shirt that just said trust, no one was like, yeah, that's legit. Right? You don't, don't go out of the gate with the big trust on somebody with important stuff. Don't do it. But the good news is, like I said, there's plenty of people out there that are good people that you are giving you. You can give all your trust to just take it slow brother. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:08:40       So crazy how you just explained that so simple and it makes total sense when you're in the situation now the motions, you know like you can't just detach and be like, what are the red flags that I know you're too busy. No missing the person or whatever your disasters. But even throwing things and looking at pictures, that's the worst to get out the picture and stare. I've seen guys do that. I'm like, Bro, give me that. Let me throw this away for you. It's not going to help that person. Yes.

Speaker 1:          02:09:12       Always to me was, was explaining like listen, cause guys was no,

Speaker 5:          02:09:19       no, she wasn't. That is a lie. That person that you put put together in your head that you've assembled in your mind, that person doesn't exist. They don't exist. The person that you dealt with was a liar, was unfaithful, is a cheater. That's the person, the person who wasn't this person that you're putting forth in your mind. That person doesn't exist. So stop. But, but you don't understand the good time. Yeah, I know. I know. I know. It's a choice. Here's the trick. Okay. So

Speaker 1:          02:09:50       if,

Speaker 5:          02:09:51       okay, that person lie at that part of the cheater and what I kind of said there, it was, look, you don't understand the good time. That's a real part of it. That's really it. It's like sure they did this. Sure. She, um, uh, flats my tires when she gets messier, all that. But the good times we have are so good. So it's, it's, it's proof that it's not about the person. It's not about the person that you can see all the red flags and how they mistreat you from time to time or they'd be true. It's about yourself and how you're sad now because of all these reasons. But the trick comes with what one of the tricks come with. Um, same thing I said about drinking, where it's your brain. Cause it's like chemicals. When you bond with someone in certain, in certain ways.

Speaker 5:          02:10:27       And it's different from, you know, it varies from person to person, but it's like, I think it's like oxytocin or I don't know where it's, it's it. Yeah. It's so I don't want to go into it. But you feel this bond with this specific person. That's why you have these feelings. Even though this girl like lies to you, you see her lying text messages on your phone right now. You're looking at him. Meanwhile, you still still miss him. It's a trick because it's saying that your emotional wellbeing is attached to this person kind of thing. Right. And all the other stuff, you just kind of ignore it. So it just, like I was saying with drinking, right? Why know consciously like I'm going to be hung over it tomorrow. I won't get anything done. All this stuff. Why do I want a drink so bad right now?

Speaker 5:          02:11:07       You know, kind of thing. Um, and it's the same thing. The chemicals in your brain are telling you like this girl is essential for you. You know, for your wellbeing's not, yeah. Oh, that's the logic though. That's a lie. It's a trickle. Listen to the, don't listen to your brain. Listen to me that she is not essential, bro. I'm telling you. But that's the logic. Those chemicals are blocking. I have seen so many situations where guys are just in, what's horrible is, I'm sitting here saying this, it's, you could be smacking someone in the face telling them, move on, move on. And they're not going to listen to that. So that's all. So you to make a decision, that's, that's, that's, it's hard. And guys ruined their lives. I mean the others do too. And Roseanne guys ruined their lives, you know, with over somebody that is completely abusive, whether mentally or physically, that just completely abusive and they will ruin their lives for this person, that person.

Speaker 5:          02:12:01       And you see in my mind, I think it's because they build a person, they build a person on the framework of reality. They build a fantasy and they're in love with that fantasy and they want to keep it going. Right? It's a fantasy. So stop and they get away. They ignore like all the Quona version and they remember the good times, even if it's like 10 minutes a week, they remember those good times. They ignore the red flags foe because of that, that you know that trick, that chemical trick in their brain. And so it reinforces that thing that they built. You know, that fantasy that they build. It's true. This big. The reality is this big. Yeah. And look the fantasy state and they just attached to it. You ever see a friend or whatever, cause I'm assuming you've never been in this situation like you ever had a friend where they're really into it.

Speaker 5:          02:12:51       They're almost ruining their life. They're in bad shape or whatever, and then whether it be all of a sudden are years later, whatever, they're thinking back and they're like, whoa. Was I think because of the chemical trick, so to speak. Whereas off and then they can see all of that logic that you're talking about and like all my gosh man, it's, it's almost like, it's almost like you feel like you were a different person when you recovering from cancer. I mean, just the fact that you can't talk any sense into people and no to that situation. That's the trick. You got to try and, yeah, it's hard. It's hard. But I think knowing that that's it. It's a chemical in your brain that is tricking you and it goes for a lot of stuff. Donuts, like all this that's tricking you. If you

Speaker 1:          02:13:31       know, like, Hey, and you say, I'm not going to be tricked. I feel it. I feel this. I feel the sadness. I feel missing this person, but it's a trick, you know? Yeah, that's, that helps. It totally helps. I like it. So move on, man. I know it's hard. Trust us. Speaking of moving on, next question, unless we want to talk about this anymore. No, exactly right. Let's move on. In what circumstances do you recommend direct? I will hold on. Oh, we're not moving on. You're stuck on it. But what's horrible is been people killed themselves in these situations over a lie. Yeah, that's, that's to me the trick, the trick. But it's a lie in and guys or girls get so distraught over this fantasy that doesn't exist. And what's really jacked up is if they could just move on, they'd find a reality that was actually congruent with what their desires are.

Speaker 1:          02:14:32       It's out there. You could see people all over the world. They're there, they're in relationships, having fun from every level, right? There's someone out there, but you, you get caught up in this mental trap and, and obsessing over a fantasy. It's a fantasy. Don't, don't, don't obsess over the fantasy, man. There's, you can, you can get over it. And there's plenty of other human beings out there that are awesome. So go find one of them. And in the meantime, hang out with your Badass self. Right? And become a better person and working out is a big one for sure. For sure. As it, that's 100% just get it, get in the gym and get after it. Jujitsu solves everything. Yes, lifting solves every leg. Right. Okay. So what circumstances do you recommend direct attack in combination with indirect, if any? Or do you have any examples?

Speaker 1:          02:15:27       Yeah, so we talk about flanking all the time. I always recommend a combined attack, right? If you only attack the flank, well then the enemy's going to Justin, they're gonna put all the defenses there. Now it's not a flank anymore. Now it's the front and becomes so, so you need to feign attack, or at least you need to attack with some minor level of force directly so that the enemy has to defend what you're doing. And I mean, clearly when, when we were, examples are pretty easy to come up with where when we're doing raids like assaults on buildings, you're gonna attack that building from multiple directions at a minimum. At least you're gonna set distractions on some of the other directions. And it was same thing we were setting up Overwatch's. Yeah, we're going to have, a lot of times we'd have a main Overwatch and we'd have a little, another little flanker Overwatch.

Speaker 1:          02:16:15       I said, when you come to get us, you're going to pay and like a classic l shaped assault. There's a reason it's called an l shape. It's shaped like an l. You have a, you have a, a fire, a base position that's going to put down fire on the target, and then you have some newer element that's going to come in from the flank, but even with that you, you, you have to do a base element and a maneuver element. There's a reason because you're going to, the base is going to put down fire and then the maneuvers going to maneuver it. So yes, those are, those are clearly some of them. And it's the same thing. Yes. It's the same thing in the business environment, right? In the business environment, if you're going to maneuver into a new market, you don't just walk away from your other market, right? You don't, if you're going to develop a new product, you don't throw away your old product. No, you keep, that's your base. You keep that going and then you frank. So it makes sense there. Um, yeah. So absolutely. When you, when you're going to attack attack from both directions. I, in fact, I do that most of the time.

Speaker 4:          02:17:23       So next question.

Speaker 1:          02:17:32       This actually isn't really a question. It's more of a comment. Yeah. I kind of turned it into a question. I know you responded to the comment, right? Yeah, sure. Just want to say quick. Thanks. I struggle with the daily grind trading days for dollars, but you helped me make it happen. Yeah. And my comment was like, okay, well thank you. I guess because I hope at the same time that you're grinding that you're trading that, that you're, I hope that you're not trading days for dollars long term because long term that's a losing proposition, right? If you're grinding and it's not doing something you want to do, if it's a grind that you can't embrace, then you got to find a way out of that. Right. You got to find you can't, Trey, you don't want to trade days for dollars because dollars don't mean anything.

Speaker 1:          02:18:28       Days. All you got. So you've got to find a way out. Now, this does not mean you need to be rash about it. This doesn't mean tomorrow you walk, you know what to do with this job anymore. I'm out and now you're broke. No, don't be rash. And don't throw the baby out with the bath water. But do come up with a longterm plan about what you want to do, how you want to do it, where you want to do it. And this might take one year or two years or five years. It might take five years to get to where you want to be. That's okay, that's fine. It's, it's actually kind of cool when you're grinding right now, cause you know there's something that you're working towards in the long run that's actually awesome. So, but, but you gotta have an exit strategy.

Speaker 1:          02:19:16       You got to have an exit strategy. You've got to plan and figure out how much money it's going to take and what are you going to do? You're going to work two jobs. I'm going to save all my money right now. I'm going to invest here. Then pay off my or whatever it is you're going to do so that you can get yourself into a position where you actually enjoy doing what you're doing. That's what you want. And the one other cool thing about this, like, like I say, man, it's cool to grind, man. That's what we're here to do. You're here doing stuff right? If you're not doing anything well then what are you doing that? So the, the other thing that's cool though about grinding and working is, is that when you get that freedom right, that you work hard for it, it can be so much more worth it.

Speaker 1:          02:20:02       The discipline that you put into place to get to that freedom that you want. It makes that freedom so much more worth it. So I appreciate it. I'm glad you're grinding. I'm glad you're grinding hard, but don't just make that trade. It's not a square trade. Days for dollars is not a square trade. Get it back under your control. And we've had, I've actually had some really cool feedback on the podcast of people that have hit me up and said, hey, I, you told me to plan an exit strategy. I wish I could find this. The Guy said, you told me to plan an exit strategy. He's like, that was whatever, nine months ago I saved my money. I just did this. Now I'm in another business. I'm kicking ass. Thank you. Right. So it can be done. It's one of the things about cool about being a human being. You've got free will, you can make stuff happen.

Speaker 5:          02:20:48       Oh it's a go make it happen man. Isn't that a lot of tricks there too where you know the, we'd talk about the disc, hyperbolic discounting when you, when you basically go for the short term payoff in at the expense of the longterm payoff. So let's say you have an exit strategy for five years. It helps actually it, it's, this is like for real help night and day where if you look at that end exit strategy as like a, you know, a goal or whatever and the time in between now and then is preparation time. That's all that is like. So a lot of times like I remember one when I was working at the nightclub that was, that was a full on like Ooh, nightclub called job, all short term payoff stuff. Kind of day to day, week to week. I get my paycheck, I go hang out, go work paycheck, hang.

Speaker 5:          02:21:38       So it's all just short term payoffs. Right. So I was in there for years, like years. How many years? Seven. Eight? No, six. That was the end of like almost seven. Yeah. Nightclub. So I remember thinking when I was like over it already. Um, I remember thinking, Dang, I feel like I wasted a lot of years. I think back now I didn't cause I learned a lot of like psychological stuff. But um, I remembered like reflecting and being like, man, I spent and yeah, I went to college, all this stuff really slacked through. Call it. I spent it the same way, just like, okay, I'll take this class because I may or may not pass it, whatever. I just want to play football and be cool, whatever. And I reflect and I think, Dang, I spent my life preparing for nothing really consciously. I mean passively I did because I liked certain creative things and that, you know, materialize for sure, but actively like consciously, I was never, you know how certain people, they're like, I want to be an architect for sure and that's it.

Speaker 5:          02:22:33       And I'm doing it. And I know a lot of times if there's family history in certain things, it's like they know, you know, and they wind up doing it a lot of time. But I reflected and thought, man, I'm here. I spent my life up to this point preparing for nothing in life. I know about working out. That's it. So a lot of times when you're making your, you find yourself in a grind that without an exit strategy or something like that, a lot of times that will be the case. Like I've spent my life kind of preparing for nothing really. But that's the good thing how you're saying it can take a year, it can take two years, five years, whatever. Start preparing for that five years and at the end when the five years comes, you are prepared straight up. If you spend one year doing something, focus like, Hey, I got to get even something like I'm going to play the piano. I don't know anything. Bow and Arrow, I dunno, you spend one year focused on it at the end of the year you can be pretty prepared. Yeah. Compared to the average person. So he spent like two years, five years preparing whatever that exit strategy is. And you're for real prepared spend. Look at that time as this is preparation time. Yeah. And it's, if only

Speaker 1:          02:23:41       somebody comes up to you, you've been working at the nightclub for a year and says, hey, echo, what are you going to do with your life? And you're like, oh, it wouldn't eat. You would immediately say, well, well let me phrase that another way. Echoed. Are you planning to, uh, you know, be a nightclub bouncer for the next 25 years? You're answered clearly be no. Okay. So what are you getting ready for? Yeah, cause a lot of times this person is aware that they're in a grind. A lot of times people don't even realize that what they're doing, they're, they're, they're marking time is what we call in the military. You're marching, but you're not going anywhere. You're, your feet are going up and down. You're spinning your wheels. So think about it. That's a great point that you just made is what, what were you preparing for?

Speaker 1:          02:24:28       If you would have been learning to play the piano, boom. You can be in the game right now. But so that's an important thing. Especially when you start talking to people that are younger, you know? Oh I'm when they're 15, 16, 17 years old. Cause there'd mark and time they're having fun. Yeah. But it's cool to have fun. Let's make sure we're making some progress and building some capacity to have a better future all the time. What can you do to build capacity for your future? Hey, you know, you heard Andy Stumpf and I talk about this and we didn't even recognize that there's anything else you could do besides being the teams. That's it. That's it. And that's kind of, that's kind of good because when you're having teams you don't want to be thinking about anything else. And luckily the teams does give you preparation for other things in life. Cause you're in leadership positions, you're going up, you learning skills, you're learning whether you're learning, parachuting and you're learning stuff. Guys get out of the teams all time. They become cops,

Speaker 5:          02:25:23       they become firemen. So they can be all kinds of good jobs. But if you're not in a job like that, you're in a job like a bead, a nightclub bouncer. Hey, it's a fun job, right? Yeah, it's cool you're having a good time, but let's make sure we have an exit strategy on that one, right? Yeah. And it doesn't even necessarily mean like if I want it to be ultimately in Devon, just saying, being conscious of it where if I want it to be a nightclub owner or something. Perfect. Yeah, I'll stay right in there. And, but here's the difference is I'm not, I wasn't consciously spending that time preparing for anything. I was going for tomorrow for it, you know, this weekend. That's all I was going for. And a lot of times, I mean in the nightclub it was, cause it was like a very recognizable payoff, you know, cause it's fun and there's this party going on.

Speaker 5:          02:26:10       But even in these grinds, like let's say working for a moving company one time it was the same thing I was looking for the weekend. It sucked. But I was like the work part stuff, but I was looking forward to getting off work. Okay. The relief is so it's, it's the same dynamic, just kind of negative, you know, it's like a negative versus the positive is the relief kind of thing. The moving company made you want to eat, eat forced your hand to want to go do something else, like a different lifestyle. Whereas the nightclub, the sooner you can get, you can get distracted and in that way you're like, hey, this is just going to be cool. Right? Yeah. So it's that that carrot and the stick, you know, the, you know, the nightclub was, I was just eating that carrot, those right in front of my face every day or every week or whatever.

Speaker 5:          02:26:51       The moving company was like, fine, I'm just trying to run away from the stick that's hitting me every day kind of thing. Yeah. So I guess it just depends on how much you hate sticks and carrots. It's just so good. And like you said, we don't listen to our parents or we don't listen to our people around us. We don't listen to it, we just don't do it. It becomes noise. That's why even you saying, what do you, what do you wanna do with your future, bro? I've heard that since, literally, since I could understand English. What are you going to do with your PR? What are you doing to prepare for your future? What are you going to do? You see yourself doing the fruit? Well, yeah, no, I don't know Leila. It's just, it's a meme or Eddie, you know, you hear it all the time. So it doesn't mean anything. That's why a lot of times it takes like someone to either rephrase it or straight up like show it to you somehow. You know where it hits you. Like Davis sock in his is he was cruising and his dad died and you got shown. Yeah. Okay. What am I doing? So good stuff to think about. Yeah, I mean personally I just got tired of it man.

Speaker 5:          02:27:46       Well I'm glad you did x question. I think we got time for one more question. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:27:57       Okay.

Speaker 5:          02:27:58       Jocko, I have read your book extreme ownership. My son and I listened to your podcast on the way home from hockey practice and while I can see your message, I can't bring myself to employ it, which I would like to do so very badly. Any suggestions?

Speaker 2:          02:28:15       Well,

Speaker 5:          02:28:18       everybody wants to employ extreme and

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       disciplines so very badly, but everybody also wants it to be easy, right? They want some, some secret power that just makes it happen and they think that I hold the magic key that's going to make discipline the easiest thing in the world. Well, I can tell you that taking ownership of your life, it isn't easy and living the life of discipline isn't easy. In fact, it's hard. That's why it works. And so if you want to employee discipline, there's only one way to do it. You employ discipline. Stop looking around for suggestions on how to employ discipline, because I'll tell you that listening to this podcast is not going to give you discipline. Reading the book is not going to give you discipline. You have to impose discipline on yourself. You ain't. You do that with steps that you execute. Small steps. Get up early, workout heart, attack your daily tasks, crush your job. Don't waste time on on on meaningless activities. That's how you employed discipline. You get aggressive in making things happen. Be The discipline. That's it. That's it. It's that simple. And I'll say it again. If you want to live a disciplined life, that's what you have to do. You have to be the discipline,

Speaker 1:          02:30:40       and I think that's all I've got for tonight. So Echo. Yes, I know you've been kind of stepping up the discipline and ownership. Why don't you take some ownership right now of telling people how they can support this podcast if they want to. I will before supporting this podcast. I think we all should support ourselves in this way. Similar to like on the airplane. Like I said before, you get the airplane and the oxygen mask, you got to put it on yourself before you can help the infant.

Speaker 5:          02:31:20       Not that, not that this podcast is an infant or nothing. Well maybe it is one year, whatever. Anyway. You know what I mean? So if you're, I've been into working out more, more consistently, we just ain't locked cause those, and you know, I'm no stranger to the workouts.

Speaker 4:          02:31:36       MMM.

Speaker 5:          02:31:40       I've been supplementing my workouts with supplements as you know, um, Krill oil just got some more boom, you know, that when you get new krill oil, like I get it now before I run out. You know? I mean, it seems obvious like, Oh yeah, you're, you're an adult now and you're prepared. I like it. Yes, exactly. Which is new for me. The buzz is still doing, I'm out of Krill oil, how order, so now I know. Yeah, no, no, no. That's not going on anymore. Which is another demonstration of discipline really. We count that. Yeah. That's kind of counseling as a daily discipline bordering Krill oil before you're out. That's right. It's true. I like what you've done there when it comes in. I'm not even out of my old, but when it comes in and feel it feels good, oils in it feels good to be prepared. Yeah. So yeah, you feel prepared. You are prepared. Yeah. You are. You like, cause you are straight up. Anyway. Krill oil. If you don't know what's Krill Omega threes is it? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:32:44       Anyway, it's real good for your joints. It can really, that's, I mean Omega Three's good. Cool. But the question is if you don't know, it's kind of like what does that do for me? You know? Well how's that going to look? How's the Omega three is going to benefit me in the Krill oil situation? It's your joints. Especially if you do a lot of pressing exercises and Jujitsu actually shouldn't say especially, I'm just saying including, but not limited to, hard pressing as you just exercises. Like where are you done there? I'm telling you man, it's the truth. Um, anyway. Yeah. So get on that Krill oil. If you have joint, a joint session situation, really, or if you don't or if you don't prevent it. If I needed to do more preventative stuff in my life, yeah, it's funny. I'll take them like I'll pull them out, you know, and they look like jelly beans.

Speaker 5:          02:33:34       I didn't realize it looked like my daughter. She's four. So look what jelly beans. But did she smell up? Nah, she don't bite him. She, you know, you smell them. Smelled like Krill oil. Hey, I was on deployment. So they make disgusting jelly beans. Have you ever seen those before? They make jelly beans that tastes like Puke, that tastes like what? Like on purpose. It's like a joke. So I was on deployment in Iraq and somebody sent me a care package, a care package, yet they were being funny. They sent me some of them bad tasting jelly beans. I didn't look at the label. I've just opened them up because I hadn't had any candy in a while. I wanted some candy. Boom. Took a mouthful. Just pure Dang. It's disgusting. Yeah. So the Krill oil jelly beans, more or less, the same thing with vitamin Itam eats up. Yeah, the packaging is different, so they don't, you know, you get those things anyways.

Speaker 5:          02:34:33       If you're interested in these krill oil tablets, this is what they are. I'm not krill. I had a little tablet to yeah, eat them, chew them if you want. Swallow my recommend because they smell and taste like krill oil anyway. But they're good for your joints. Yeah. On it. Okay. So the really all the supplements you're going to want to take is from on it. So go to on it.com/ajiaco if you want the 10% off. But like I said, back to the support part where, okay, so you know how like when you work out and then you ever work on, you're like a my knees or my elbow or something is bothering them. It's like your whole body's working fine. You can bench a bunch, you can squat a bunch, but it's like your elbow, it's like holy, you know, you're, you're only as strong as your weakest link.

Speaker 5:          02:35:27       Elbows, knees. That's your weak link right there. That's what the Krill oil does. That's what it alleviates. You know? That's important is what I'm saying. Yeah, I agree with, here's the thing, I didn't really understand that, but at Bro, I've, I've done it where I've taken like Ibuprofen to like, okay. It's cause it's just pain. It's not like I'm going to pull like if it's your muscle or something like a strained muscle. Yeah, it's like a pain, but it'll inhibit cause you have a little chain decide to start taking krill oil. Um, I mean I know I take and I was like, yeah, you should try it. Or did I say that or did you just start trying it on your own? It was you, but I heard about it. You know, my wife's, my father in law would, oh screw it was better than fish oil.

Speaker 5:          02:36:09       I was like, cool. I don't even take fish oil. So it didn't really mean much to me. I lift nothing. I'm, I'm looking for gains bro. C'Mon, I leave me alone with a girl. But yeah, that was it. And you mentioned it and um, you know, like you're not hobbling around in pain and other, so I said, hey, if chocolate doesn't let me go try. And then I got it from a guy that was like a power lifter really strong and he was, you know, 56 years old when I met him. He was a great shape and I said, what, what'd you do? He said, yeah, I told that's not the only thing. He also works out hard and all that stuff. But yeah, it's a good thing to know about. That's really, that was my point really. You know, like my, you know, you can be strong but when you got your elbow jacked up from being strong, really you got to patch that little thing naturally. Like cause it's not like you're putting quarters, cortisone shots or in my case Ibuprofen, just to mask the pain so you can get gains. It's different. It's like a whole thing. I was telling them, Taylor, I was talking with him, we rolled through a little, did we know? We didn't know. We were just talking and uh, I told him how old I was and he's like, what? You know, it's the Krill oil man.

Speaker 5:          02:37:24       Notice I didn't mention how old nonetheless, if you like Krill, I actually there's some good soul, you know, the per case. So there's this total strength and performance to um, I was, I was looking at that because it's real interesting like stuff in the clinical studies, it's over time. So it is considered a preworkout. So typically when people take it consistently, consistently out your gains, it's like a cumulative effect. What I mean, just like Krill oil though, really like because here's why I got traded. I didn't get trick. But here's why I misunderstood. Is usually a preworkout has like caffeine and stimulants and Cheryl have like other stuff allegedly, I don't know. But usually you take a pre workout so you get fired up physiologically to go lift, get big pump, get all this, you know, this performance stuff or whatever from the caffeine and all that.

Speaker 5:          02:38:19       Total strength. And performance doesn't have caffeine. Yeah. So it's a different, it's a whole different kind of system that's giving you the benefit. Feels good though. Yeah, that and but true tech too. Same thing where you can take it that day and you'll feel it that day because it helps. Oxygenate guy said I double at double dip on those to get all of it all up on it. And downfall trip to South Africa. I didn't have either. Oh Dang. Um, what do you call it when you don't take what's up? Go on slick. I guess here we had some good rolls down there too. Yeah, I was, I was thinking to myself back to the guys that were down there, chef and Richie, they're like, Hey, do you know tomorrow night? Because I went and rolled the first night at their fight fit and the the first night, you know, we'd trained a little bit, you know, but we were hanging out and then they said, hey, when you come back tomorrow we're just going to do like 10 rounds, ten five minute rounds.

Speaker 5:          02:39:14       I was like, okay, cool. And then I got the home and the next morning or the next afternoon, we were heading over there. I said, yeah, I wouldn't mind having a little bit of shroom tech. Right. But I didn't have it. He had to go slick. Good Times. Amen. You know, and hey, go and slick. That's cool. But you don't have to. Yeah, no. I mean, we didn't want her, I wanted to have a little bit that some of us, we don't want that be, I mean, also we're going to take this room tech, we're going to take the, the cro to me, again, back not to go too deep on the Krill oil, but that one I think is like an essential, that's like an everyday thing. You know, like people, they'll drink coffee every single day. You know what I mean? Yeah. And Co I say cool drink coffee, but it should be like that because the crew is way more beneficial than the coffee. I mean, coffee is more like, it's like an immediate thing anyway.

But the good thing about you is actually, actually one of the, one of the reasons that listen to you is because he listened to me and you listen to others, you know, we visit the others. So people be like, Hey Xyz, make that into his shirt or you know, hey you said make that into a shirt or they'll just come up with their own thing, you know, prioritize x out and whatever and make it a shirt. So during that listening.

Speaker 2:          02:45:29       Okay.

Speaker 5:          02:45:30       I kinda, we kinda just took it to heart in a real general way. And there's some new stuff. I like that. Yeah. It's good. It's good options. Yeah. But you can't, we can't make every shirt that everything. No. And I just don't, that wouldn't be practical. No. Would it be, and some do. I mean, I gotta be honest. I say some cool stuff. Also say some dumb stuff. Dumb stuff. Yeah. Or you know, something that made be, wouldn't translate onto a shirt that someone would actually wear other than maybe a handful of people. Then we'll just say some short ideas and make more sense than others. We'll just say that. But nonetheless, uh, we are, and this is going to be a result of it with some, you know, maybe some new stuff. Oh, there's also some patches, patches, the velcro ones and whatnot. Um, hoodies, rash guards, performance.

Speaker 5:          02:46:23       I think we do another crash guard design as well. Not going to get rid of the old one. The old ones. The current ones. That one's dope to none. The less, just more options. You know, guys want to get after it and have different looks, maybe even have to in rotation that looked different. Boom. So yeah, we do that anyway. All these things, you can look at them if you like what you see, one, two, three things, whatever, however many things. Get it support that way. Good way to support such a good way. Yeah. Um, yeah. And, and you're representing, so it was kind of like, it's, it's like an official way to kind of just jump in the game, you know? You know what I mean? I do. I saw, remember, um, ah, I dunno if, yeah, you met him, right? Yeah, that's Sam.

Speaker 5:          02:47:05       He came in the gym and shaved head. So he was just sitting there in the den, in the lounge downstairs. I'm, I'm going to get something to my car real quick. I see. I see the shirt. Of course I'm gonna say something. But before I say anything, I'm thinking in my mind, look at this guy representing hard. And the thing is, I don't know him. You know, there's a guy I haven't met or whatever. And you get that feeling like that guy's representing. And that's the feeling you get really, you know when you see somebody in the wild with it. Well, I actually, speaking of that, I got a little story to tell. Somebody hit me up and they said, hey, I was out in the wild, saw someone with uh, with the Jocko podcast tee shirt on, walked over to him through the bone of fees on them.

Speaker 5:          02:47:50       Like you ever seen like a spy movie where I come up and I say it is cold and dark in the winter and the person responds in March, it will be warmer and now we know we're going to go. So what was the bone of fees? This dude walked up to the other dude with a trooper tee shirt on and he said, good evening. I go and boom. They knew what was up. So I think that's become the official bone of fees of Jocko podcast. Yeah. If you, if you see someone who didn't know wild well you know, it might be a situation where you can't just get crazy. Nope. You just got to walk up and say good evening echo and then they'll, then you can do your burpees and that. That feeling is real though. That feeling that I had when he, when you see it it's like, ah, yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:48:35       You kind of know, you know. Anyway, it's cool that way you'll have a little added layer if you will. Anyway. Also psychological warfare. If you didn't know what psychological warfare, this is what it is. It's an album with tracks and they're not music tracks. They're not. Jocko was hardcore band tracks. Bronson's children's tracks. It's not that. What it is is little. They're not even excerpts cause they're just loan tracks for specific things and those things are, if you're feeling weakness at any point while you're trying to consistently get after it, wake up early or workout or stick to your mental QRF. Quick Reaction Force. Yeah. Weakness in your, yeah, here we go. Boom. Call the QRF. Who they are. I kind of look at it as like a spot, you know like when it goes to those people that don't lift a spot is when someone helps you lift whatever weight you're trying to lift and, and not to split hairs, but really it's not necessarily there to help you.

Speaker 5:          02:49:33       It's, I mean ultimately a help general med. Sure. You don't go down. Yes, exactly. So they're sleeping. If you want to really get after, if I'm going to work every single day, no days off one year, big, big tall order right there. Just like if I'm going to bench this 10,000 pounds, what? I'm going to make two videos a week, I would have bench more than I've mentioned before, but I'm going to go from go from my one rep Max. It makes sense to have a spot. You might get that one rep Max and not need the spot, but it's there if you fail, like if it's like too much or it feels like too much with that guy, stand up, just nudge you as much as you need. That's really how, this is just how I look at it. Accurate. Yeah. Potentially right. Based on what it is, is you put the track on like, oh shoot, I'm about to skip this workout.

Speaker 5:          02:50:24       I'm about to make this workout day a rest day. No you're not. Yeah. You don't want to do that. No. You can rest tomorrow, today at work or rest on the day that you have scheduled for rest for really new thing. Don't just impromptu make it arrested cause you feel like it's not how it works. If you need a little spot in doing that, you listened to a track called workout, get workout. I don't know. One of the workouts spots cause there's, there's a couple for workout, there's one for waking up. There's three for waking up. Yeah. See. And there's one for kind of sticking to the Diet plan, you know, like there's that kind of stuff and um, yeah, you put it on and there's one for getting for forcing yourself through creative blocks. Yeah. Right. Which kind of sounds like impossible, but you know, tell you who it's possible.

Speaker 5:          02:51:11       I would say, I will say that this will get you through it 100% of the time. Like I, I'm trying to imagine the feeling that you would, that would result in your heart if you listen to this and you still skip the workout thrall. Yeah. It's hard to fathom the feeling you would have anyway. It's very helpful and I'm a real good spot, you know, and it's chocolate talking to you. So he's like kind of there with you. You know that guy you want there. That's my opinion anyway. It's called psychological warfare. It's on iTunes. So if you just do a search, psychological warfare, Jocko Willink, get that you can support that way. But this is one where this is real good support for yourself. Make it your ringtone. Wake up, wake up, call, clear it with your wife first. You could have some problems. Spouses do not like. Yeah, that's a good one. And it happened. Happens to be number one still on iTunes. That's awesome. Yup.

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       Since day one, by the way. Yes. That's, thank you for the support and on that one. Um, all right, while you're on Amazon real quick, this is a couple of things I have to cover. Um, I've legally have to do this Jocko white tea. We're, we're, it looks like we're gonna have to go put a warning on it cause there's a little situation going on. Got a uh, uh, uh, trooper hit me up on Twitter and this is what he said. Warning, I started drinking Jocko t and the wife became pregnant, should be on the label. So he was also wondering if the child would arrive as a brown belt in Jujitsu. Now to be honest with you, we should have tested this further. You know, we should have tested this further. We didn't and we aren't a hundred percent sure if babies produced under the influence of Jocko white tea will be a brown belt.

Speaker 1:          02:53:06       They will be a purple belt minimum but they might not be a brown belt but fertility. Yup. It's confirmed prenatal Jujitsu skills confirmed and confirmed to the level of about 147%. So order the t make it, drink it, it tastes so good. It tastes like victory. So you can get that. You can, you can also preorder where the warrior kid book. Now, Uncle Jake is trying to explain to mark what a warrior is, so he gives him a notebook that has various warrior codes in it. He's got the ranger creed, he's got the seal code, he's got the marine core core values. He's got the the seven virtues of Bushido, the Samurai Code. He's got the code of Chivalry for nights. He's got the Viking laws. We've got all these like war your codes in there so that young mark knows what is up and we should all, we can all kind of need to know what is up with some of them.

Speaker 1:          02:54:14       The Vikings, you know, you might not thank you might think yourself out viking laws. What you know, what kind of liking teach me, why would I need to know if viking loss, how could I possibly get anything? So you get way the warrior kitty, you order it. You won't even start going through the Viking laws. Let me tell you what they say. Viking laws, be brave and aggressive. Be Direct, grab all opportunities, use varying methods of attack. Be Versatile and I agile attack one target at a time. Don't plan everything in detail. Use Top quality weapons. Be prepared. Keep weapons in good condition. Keep in shape. Find good battle comrades. Agree on important points. Choose one chief, be a good merchant. Find out what the market needs. Do not promise what you can't keep. Do not demand overpayment arranged things so that you can return. Keep the camp in good order.

Speaker 2:          02:55:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:55:20       Keep things tidy and organized, arranged enjoyable activities that strengthen the group. Make sure everybody does useful work. Consult all members of the group for advice. Hey, this viking laws, 1200 years old, is there anything you might be able to get out of that? Yes, absolutely. We can all take something away from that. So

Speaker 1:          02:55:46       bunch of warrior codes in there and by the way, mark, he ends up writing his own war. Your kid code. Yeah. Yeah. Kind of kid code that I wish I would have lived by. You know what I'm saying? Yes. It's going to help some people out. Also just released. We got the discipline equals freedom field manual coming. This is what you were asking for a book. It pretty much represents what we talk about this on this podcast. Faults and action. The thoughts are aligned with what you hear on this podcast. The actions are more detailed than what I say on the podcast. More granular, more specific workouts of food intake, martial arts. So disappointing because field discipline equals freedom field manual. You can get some of that. You can also pick up a couple of copies of extreme ownership of course.

Speaker 2:          02:56:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:56:36       Lessons of combat leadership that we talk about on this podcast. By the way from Henry the fifth to HR McMaster spans a pretty good time and those lessons of combat leadership translate to business and life and the laid out in extreme ownership very simply and very clearly. So what you do is you order one for you and then you order one for everyone in your chain of command up and down, get some monster, May 4th and fifth the New York City Marriott Marquis Register now, book your hotel booking travel, come and get it. You know it's morning PT. That's where we start with full days of leadership training, leadership, discussion, Q and a lot of Q and a. Also just hanging out.
