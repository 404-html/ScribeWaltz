Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 74 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening now. I always dug music and I'm pretty sure it started when my dad would play a Hank Williams sr on the eight track in his, I think it was a 1971 barracuda and he'd play that trip, that tape just over and over again. And I still know those songs by heart. And then, you know, like I, that was when I was a little kid and then I got a little bit older and like a lot of kids, all of a sudden I was listening to the Beatles. Elvis thought they were great. I still think that song, while my guitar gently weeps is a good song, but that wore out kind of quickly and it was something wasn't there in that music. Something just wasn't quite there. The music didn't sound how I felt.

Speaker 1:          00:01:16       And then in 1980 ACDC back in black came out and it was popular. Right? It was popular. And so it went into my ears at some point and I said, Dang, all right, better closer. Sure. Warmer. We're getting there and then I washed around in the hard rock for a while, Hendrix led Zeppelin and I can't help throwing it on a little Jack Black when I say that. If you watch that tribute that he did to them and that you know, some of the kids that I hung around with and New England, they rode that train down to hippiedom. You know we're talking Crosby, stills and Nash and Janice Joplin and the grateful dead and all that. I couldn't relate, wasn't there. It didn't get there. Didn't seem to reflect the world that I was beginning to see myself. I got on the other train. Right, and we're talking about van Halen.

Speaker 1:          00:02:24       Yes. This is the 1980s you know if you were a kid in America age 13 we got issued the album 1984 by van Halen. That was just a given. You are going to get that God is your diver down. Boom. You can need to listen to this. This is rock and roll people. This is Eddie van Halen. Listen to that Guitar Solo eruption listened again. Do it again. Iron Maiden, right? Actual Song called trooper, you know, you got to listen to that when you're a kid. And so now I'm heading in the right direction. I'm feeling it is starting to reflect what the things are like in my head. And then there was that day where I got an album called black sabbath by a band called black sabbath. And the first song is also called black Sabbath. And I put that on and boom, I had found something that sounded like I was thinking.

Speaker 1:          00:03:29       And from there I was definitely on the right train. Then it was Motorhead and soon after the Ramones boom. And then that leads to the sex pistols cause you're just going harder. That's what you do. That's what I was doing. Like what's a little bit harder than that? What's a little bit harder than that? Sex pistols, bodies, no feelings. They're singing songs, no feelings. Okay, I hear what you're saying. Louder, more anger. And then finally we get to black flag my war side to still one of my all time favorites. Minor threat. Get Ahold of a little band. Another little band from DC called the bad brains. Some Detroit hardcore negative approach.

Speaker 1:          00:04:22       And then so I was, you know, I was Kinda in the game, right? I was there. And so 87 rolls around and one of my friends who is actually more of a metal head at this time, he gives me a cassette tape cause this was dark and the dairy when you were just going to have to listen to cassette tapes and they were usually dubbed 47 times from somebody else. But the eye, this was the real tape and this was the real deal. This was an actual original with the full cover on it and everything. And the cover of this tape was just a giant mushroom cloud of death and destruction and above the mushroom cloud in large old English script blazed. And across the top it said Cro mags. Okay. And then underneath the mushroom cloud in a little bit smaller script and old English, it said the age of coral. Okay. So I put it in my tape deck and I press play. And the first track

Speaker 1:          00:05:32       it hit me like a training and it's the first track was called the we got to know. And let me just tell you the lyrics. Sure. Struggling in the streets. Just trying to survive, searching for the truth, just to keep us alive. Got To break these cha shackles, got to break these chains. The only way we'll do it as if we use our brains, there's gotta be some meaning to the purpose of life. I know there must be more than the struggle and strife looking for the answers and I need a clue, but my mind is so disturbed now what do I do now? I can tell you I was not struggling in the streets, but like most teenage kids, I did feel some shackles, right? You feel the shackles of things and I was looking for answers and I needed to clue and so I was like, hmm, yeah, we're on to something.

Speaker 1:          00:06:26       The next title track had me a little worried. I'm a little concerned cause you know, like I said, there was a lot of kids were taking the hippie route and so I was not into that. The next song title had me a little concerned. It was the song was called world peace as I was kind of Oh red flag and then I listen to the lyrics, lyrics, all you hippies, better state start to face reality. Are You all your far fetched dreams of anarchy? Better start to see things the way they are because the way things are going, they won't be going far. World piece can't be done. It just can't exist. World piece can't be done and arche is a mess. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:13       And the rest of the album kept up that assault on my brain, on my attitude. And that was it. I had found something called hardcore music and it, I never really left it. And I listened to Cro mags and a ton of other hardcore bands from that time until now. And that's pretty much essentially the soundtrack of much of my life. And it had a pretty big influence on me. And it was an attitude that I kept throughout my life and it was my own interpretation. I can tell you that right now. It was my own kind of, you know, you listen to the lyrics and you kind of apply what it means in your world. That's what I did, which to me was pretty simple because to me hardcore meant hardcore. That's weird. That's pretty simple. Hardcore in everything. You do. Work hard to be aggressive, don't back down, fight for what you believe in, hold the line. And that's kind of what I did in my life.

Speaker 1:          00:08:17       And I dunno, like a year ago or something, somebody asked me something about, you know, on, on the interwebs, someone said, oh Yo, what, what, what band should I listen to? You know, I said, oh, Bob, Blah Blah Cro mags, you know, check them out, whatever. And you might want to do that. And eventually, you know, it's the, the Internet is an incredible thing. And eventually I, I, uh, the founding member of the chromatics guy by the name of Harley Flanagan, sure. He like reached out and say, Hey, what's up man? How are you doing? And I had heard over the years, you know, that Harley was [inaudible] guy, black belt in Jujitsu. And so, you know, he's just kinda hit me up and eventually, you know, we were talking and he said, Hey, I've got a book coming out and send it to you. And I said, cool. Yeah. And he said, man, the books crazy. And I was kind of like, yeah, you know? Yeah, I know man, because you know how I was around that. It's cool. I get it. It's kind of crazy. And he's like, no, no, no man, it's, it's crazy. And I said, okay, cool. So he sent it to me and then I read the book and

Speaker 1:          00:09:33       Damn, I had, I had no idea, actually, I had a semblance of an idea, you know, because in the hardcore scene, people know each other. I mean like, you know that you know, you after a show, you talk to everyone and it's the band members, it's people. Everyone kind of knows each other. So I had heard stories, but the book, when the reality behind the stories was, was way more intense and crazy than I could have a, a thought. It was and it was one point when I was reading the book, I'm going to read a little excerpt right now and it said this, this is hardly when I started working on this book, I was staying at a hotel in the red light district in Amsterdam in Amsterdam. The working title was the longest suicide note ever written. I was trying to document the madness from as far back as I can remember until the end, the story of my life as an insane suicidal joy ride of rock and roll depravity and demise until the final crash and burn. It was going to be a book that all the great fuckups never got to write cause they died first. So I began working on it. I figured the end would've come sooner than later,

Speaker 1:          00:11:03       but I was wrong. And once I got done reading the book, I reached out to Harley and I said, hey man, there's a lot in this book. That's crazy. And the fact that you live through it in the fact that you got through it and the fact that you got to the position that you're in now with your life, I think a lot of people can learn from it. And it'd be awesome if you come onto the podcast and Harley said, let's do it. So Harley Flanagan, welcome to the show, man. It's great to be here. Thank you for having me on. Yeah, it's awesome. And I saw you several times when I was a kid and we were trying to figure out names of clubs where I saw you, but that was pretty cool and it's pretty cool to be here. I guess we're talking about, uh, 30 years later. You know, cause I was seeing you when I was in my teens, 14 1315 around there and here we are. Pretty amazing trip we've had since then. Yeah. And usually when I ask people, Hey, you know, talk about where you come from quickly and kind of where you grew up. And we don't spend a lot of time there because most people didn't really do anything significant that had any long term impact on their lives when they're like eight, nine, 10 years old. Right. But for you,

Speaker 1:          00:12:27       I mean, when you were eight, nine, 10 years old, shit was already crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, she was pretty much crazy from the start. Yeah. I'm gonna, I'm gonna just kind of pull a little something here out of the book just to give a little bit of background. This is from Harleys book, hardcore life on my own. I was born at San Francisco General Hospital on March 8th, 1967 at the start of the summer of love. My mom's name is rose Marie Fillioux fill you, fail you. And my dad's name was Harley Wayne Walker. Flan again. My mom was a hippie. My Dad was a drifter and somehow their paths crossed before the hippie days. My mom was into all the early rock and roll stuff, Motown and pretty much all the music that was happening when she was young. Her father, Juan failure. Yes. One Phil Yu wan Fairview came from the Dr. The Dominican Republic came to America through Ellis island by himself when he was in his early teens and one was the first was one of the first Americans to join the United States army served in world war two where he played in the military band.

Speaker 1:          00:13:41       That's how he got his citizenship by serving in the military. He was one of the funniest people I ever knew. You worked all kinds of different jobs, everything from building a building super to a long storm and he was a charming guy with a thick Spanish accent. So that's the beginnings. Do you speak any Spanish a curse? A little bit about, so you've got that now you continue on. My mom was a go go dancer and like so many people, she was caught up in the whole drug culture of the 60s when I was a kid. She was still a stripper. I remember going to work with her a few times when I was little. That was weird. Looking back on it now, there was even a short period of time when she was a Dominatrix, but that was later. My Dad left home for good or around the same age as me, maybe 14 or 15 and started riding freight trains. He liked to live from moment to moment and from everything I've heard. He had a serious drug and alcohol issues most of his life. He was always in and out of prison.

Speaker 2:          00:14:51       It's

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       hard to accept that your dad chose heroin and alcohol over you. It really does kind of hurt even now. I guess that might be one of the reasons why it turned out the way I did.

Speaker 1:          00:15:07       My mom and me did a lot of hitchhiking and stayed with a lot of different people. A lot of crazy shit happen on those trips. At one point, a friend of hers was going to Europe and asked, do you want to come? And my mom was like, I'm getting the fuck out of here. She did and I went with her. I was probably around three or four that was that. I never saw my father again. I stayed in Europe pretty much until I was about 10 but I come back to the states every year or so. We settled down in Denmark, 1971

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       Denmark and Danish culture are very wholesome. It's a great place to grow up, but of course there's an underside to in the 60s and in my case, the late sixties and seventies it was cool in certain aspects and wasn't so cool. And others, you had all these people fucked up on drugs and all the free love. Everybody's fucking everybody. And it's not really the best environment for a kid to grow up in. And as cool as some of the things, and a lot of the people were, a lot of them were, at least some of them were just fucking lost. And Yeah, all the kids were wild. What do you expect? I mean, we were just in an imitating the grownups, so as a result, I was getting laid and doing all kinds of other crazy shit. Before I'd even reached puberty, you basically had a bottle, a little kids just going off. You got all these hippie kids with their hippie parents, seeing all kinds of craziness. Adults running around naked people doing drugs being insane. That shit rubs off on kids. Damn. Yeah. Did you completely think that was normal at the time? Was that just the way the world was?

Speaker 3:          00:16:53       Well, that's the way my world was. Um, I didn't realize really that we were so a different from the rest of society, uh, until my parents tried to put me into a regular school. And, uh, of course I started getting fucked with a lot by the kids because I had long hair and you know, I didn't, I didn't really fit in and uh, my parents looked like freaks and now is when it really hit me. And it was also, yeah, I went from being at that hippy school to being in a very strict school in Denmark, which was like real old school and very rigid. So it was total culture shock. She was like, what the fuck, you know? And um, so I started cutting school a lot and going back to the free school to visit all my friends there and just hang out.

Speaker 1:          00:17:42       And that free school, that's, that's where you started is that, that's where he started playing for as much, you know, I mean, I was always into music, but that was really

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       the first place that facilitated it. You know, like they, that was one of the cool things about that school was um, they really pushed the arts, whatever the kid's interests where they would give you the ability to pursue that. Unfortunately, they were also very lax. So if like you didn't have the interest in pursuing math or whatever, they'd be like, oh well, you know, he's just not interested in it. You know, he wants to be a musician and it's like, you know, as, as we all know as parents is like, no, fuck that. You need to, you need to know how to do your math. You need to know your shit. You need to know how to use your brain. You know, it's not just about, you know, gratifying your artistic and creative interests because that's not going to always pay your fucking bills. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:18:38       So, no, but it was, it was cool. It was, it was cool in certain ways. Like I said, you know, they, uh, my math teacher, he was actually from the states, he was from the Bronx and, uh, he was a jazz drummer and played standup bass. And he really was a big inspiration on me musically. And so, you know, it gave me some tools, you know, that came in handy later in life. Yeah, for sure. So you were listening to actually got your first Gig then? Like, like you were playing little Santana covers kool and the gang.

Speaker 4:          00:19:18       Yeah, my school band was cool. Yeah, no, they were fucking legit. I mean, we were like, you know, funky stuff, you know. I mean, we were plans, like I said, um, my math teacher, he was one of the band leaders. So, you know, you've got a guy from the Bronx who was a jazz dude. He's going to be teaching all these little Danish kids musically, what's really going on. Right. Because in Denmark at the time, things like, you know, Abba was what was big, you know, so, you know what I mean? So it was like, what the fuck, you know? So, yeah, my school was cool as far as music and a counter culture and all that shit. But then, you know, then well as, as you maybe have seen in the book really. Then when my mother of all people turned me onto the sex pistols, that's what really, uh, that changed everything for me, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:20:05       Thanks mom. That was, that was, that was an eye opener. Oh yeah, the sex pistols. Oh yeah. Yeah. It changed everything for me. And at that time, like you got one second here where you said, I remember coming off stage and you're playing with the band that I think the school band at this point, I remember coming off stage one night and these girls, no, yeah. Not, was hanging out with, they were like, you know, that lady you came with, which was her mom, she's in the bathroom. She's not feeling too good. I went in the bathroom and my mom was throwing up all over the place. That kind of shit was a kind of come down back to reality that I have to walk your mom home. Yeah. It's fucked up. You know, little things like that, they stay with you forever. But, um, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       to, to her, uh, she did, she did sober up eventually and you know, she's, she sobered up for about in the eighties to the day she died. She was clean and uh,

Speaker 5:          00:21:01       you know,

Speaker 3:          00:21:04       Eh, you know, people fall victim to drugs, to alcohol and sometimes it's hard to pull yourself out, you know. But eventually she did, you know, unfortunately I had to witness a lot of real, um, ridiculous shit. But um,

Speaker 5:          00:21:18       yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:21:19       You know, I don't think there's such a thing as a perfect parent, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:21:23       Yeah, no, no doubt about that.

Speaker 6:          00:21:28       And your mom, she did, like you said, she gets you the sex pistols out and that they need, like you said in here, you said, well that was that. Yeah. Yeah. It's almost concerts. What I was saying, here we go, go into your book here. Until that point, I hung around with all these little hippie kids. I had long ass hair, so we were really already little freaks. We'd walk around the streets, people would give us looks and trip out on us. Our parents and teachers had long hair and beards and shit like that. But then punk rock came about and this was more appropriate for me. It wasn't all peace and love, it was just more me. The music was raw and the imagery and the craziness appealed to me. It was energetic and a big factor for me was you didn't have to aspire to be Jimi Hendrix.

Speaker 6:          00:22:16       She didn't have to be Carlos Santana. So you listen to that music and you'd say, you know what? I can just play it. I can do this. You can play that, do this. I can have fun and do this shit like this is, you know, you don't need to rack your brain to figure out how to do this. You could just do it. You know your power cords on man, you just need some Saturday, man. That's all you need, man. That's all you fucking mean. It was funny is I always tell people this about music. If you go to a guitar store anywhere in America, and you put up a little flyer in there that says, you know, I need someone that can play every note on the following three albums, you know, and you pick complex, you pick rush and cart and there too, there'll be, there'll be, you'll get 10 people that'll say, yeah, I can play all that stuff, I'll play it for you right now. But there's and all those guys, I mean, a lot of those guys, unless they have that thing, unless they have that sincerity that you're talking about and they have that little spark of creativity, it doesn't matter how technical you are, if you don't have that heart,

Speaker 3:          00:23:18       you could be technically amazing and have not one ounce of inspiration and your fucking body, you know. And uh, I mean, look, man, you know, the Ramones were, you know, some of the worst, greatest musicians ever. You know, those guys could barely fucking play. And they wrote some songs, they wrote songs that are still anthems, you know, songs that you will still hear played at, like major sports arenas or whatever. I mean, you know.

Speaker 4:          00:23:47       Yeah. But you know, music's a fucking weird thing man. It is. It is. And uh, you had your first band called little big boss. Was that in reference to you? I'm assuming he must have been years old. You know, it must've been because the other two guys in the band, we were adults and they named the band. So looking back they probably named it after me cause I was like, I guess already tired tyrant to play with. You know, you were playing drums at that point. Yeah. Hammering all the drums and then you guys move back to, uh, back to New York and you're going back and forth, back and forth to New York. Yeah, me and my mom, we lived in Europe, but we would come back every like year or year and a half or so to see my grandparents and my aunts and stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:24:33       And so we always had that connection to New York. We always came back and I know, and I, I was here during all of the pivotal moments in history in New York. Like, you know, I remember son of Sam, which was huge if you were here, you know, I remember the blackouts, which were also huge. If you hear, I remember the garbage strike, which was also insane because you had like, you know, 20 foot mountains of garbage every fucking where, I mean the city stank. I mean, you know, like I remember all the madness of New York. I mean I moved back here for good and 79, like I guess January or February of [inaudible] 79. I mean it was like the weeks it died. Actually the stimulators we're supposed to play Max's the one weekend that he was playing and he died before the show. But um, yeah, you know, it was a much different place back then.

Speaker 4:          00:25:25       You know, you guys know, you know, but um, you know, a lot of people who've only been here over the last 20 years, they have no clue if it is a different place. And, and I mean, you know, in, in the book you got crazy pictures like you and Andy Warhol. Yeah. Cause you were just your, your, it was your aunt Denise that was running with them? Well, no, actually he that or is that just a ran? My mom actually knew him. She had been in one of his movies when she was young when she was like 15 or something. And um, that picture was just taking it at the class show. Like I used to run into people like him at different clubs and stuff. This was the backstage at a clash gig. The first time they played in New York. You look like you're about 10.

Speaker 4:          00:26:11       It was a, I was actually 12 in that picture. Um, but yeah, I mean I was at all the clubs all the time, you know, I mean it was actually, it was a, you know, kind of weird, you know, thinking back on it. Cause like, I mean, when I, when I, um, I did a thing with Anthony Bordain awhile back and he was like, you know, he, he's like, I remember standing in front of clubs like Max's and trying to get in and you know, here come this like 12 year old kid and just like walk through the fucking door. Like the bouncers were just like, let him in. Like, you know, he belonged in

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       there and I'm like, what the fuck? Why the fuck is this child here? Like, who let him in and who the fuck is he and why are they serving him? Like he's the fucking mayor, you know? And uh, you know, thinking back and it's fucking little strange, you know, I mean, I was, I was the youngest kid that you around on the club scene back then. And then, you know, as time went on, you know, my band, the stimulator has really had a lot to do with it. The, the crowds at the show has started getting younger and younger because like, you know, we started pulling a very young following, you know, go figure 12 year old in the band. And um, people like the Beastie boys, they started coming to see it before they were the Beastie boys. They were like, they were just fans of ours, friends of mine, they were like some of my best friends growing up.

Speaker 3:          00:27:32       And, and then a lot of other people who went on to start a lot of the first wave of New York hardcore bands were fans of the stimulators kids who were all like, you know, in their early teens when they used to see us play. And then they went on to start a lot of the bands that, um, you know, set off that. Now how long did you play with the stimulator for? Uh, I only played with them from like 79 to like 80, maybe the beginning of 81. And then I was done with it because at that point I had already, you know, the bad brains had come to New York and I was already, and I was all that first hardcore that came out from, you know, black flag circle jerks, minor threat. And of course bands like discharge from overseas, from England, you know, and all that shit was starting to really, um,

Speaker 3:          00:28:26       take over my, my, uh, my soul. And, uh, so I was like, you know what, I can't play with the fucking steaming as anymore. That shit is too poppy. It's too, like, it's happy. It's just not, it's not where I am. And at that point, I had already, you know, the life I was living on the streets and the wife that, uh, the other band members were living was not really the same. I was just hitting my teens. And as we all know, that's when the problems begin, you know, that's when you start getting in trouble. So, yeah. And the music that I started writing really reflected the, um,

Speaker 3:          00:29:09       the feelings that, uh, that I was having. And, uh, you know, the cause of the, not just the environment but just, you know, everything leading up to that point had, had created this person. Yeah. And, uh, and it was a really violent neighborhood. Yeah. It was a really violent neighborhood and I ate a lot of shit for being white. And, um, which is ironic because, you know, I'm according to Minuchin and I'm Cherokee and Choctaw, but if you look at me especially, you know, in all Puerto Rican neighborhood, I'm a white boy, you know, so I really ate a lot of shit. I really, you know, until I started fighting and actually started getting more, I hate to say it, but it started getting more violent. That started to earn me a little bit of respect. And, uh, I guess the fear and the credibility kind of went hand in hand. Like when people, you know, people knew that they couldn't fuck with me. I started getting respect and, um, I don't really think that's a really healthy for a young mind to associate popularity with violence and aggression, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:30:20       Yeah. And I mean New York at that time and like you said, and I, I used to come down to New York sometimes when I was younger and it was completely different, you know, in the, in the mid eighties. You were there earlier than that. But for me in the mid eighties, when you'd come down here, it was completely different. I mean, we're sitting here right now in times square times square was nuts, man. There was like, you take two every two steps, somebody to be offering you drugs, you know, I used to come here when I would cut school and just watch people get pickpocketed watched the hookers turning tricks and the guy is selling drugs and the people getting into trouble and yeah, it was, it was, it was a fucking free for all. It's really, and where you were living, you were living here were strict. Yeah. Was [inaudible] it was way worse. I mean, I was talking to ist the other day, we were talking about,

Speaker 3:          00:31:07       about, you know, some of our experiences and uh, just in my area alone, I mean there was about five or six gangs within the, you know, 10, 15 block distance, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:31:20       everything from the Hitman on my block who were, were fucking really out of control and to the hell's angels on Third Street who back then were like legitimately no fucking joke. I mean,

Speaker 3:          00:31:32       you know, I mean, I can tell you some fucked up stories, but you know, you could,

Speaker 4:          00:31:39       he told me he fucked up stories too. So where does that go? It goes into uh, you know, uh, it's just, it's, it's hard to, uh, if people go to New York now, it's just completely different. Yeah, it really is, man. It's, it's impossible to really get it. I mean, the best thing you could do is look at old movies that Kinda tried to capture that. Then you got some pictures in the book that show the neighborhoods and there you can tell, you can tell what they look like, a war zone. I mean, I wouldn't know, but they look as close to what they looked like a war zone. You can take it from me on that one. Looked like a war zone. I mean, dude, I was living in a squat. We literally had no running water, no windows, no. How old were you when you like moved out? I, when I was like 14, you know, because basically I was getting into so much trouble in school that they were about to basically take it

Speaker 3:          00:32:31       from my mother and put me in like Spotford and I was like, fuck this, you know, I had lost interest in school and,

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       and all that shit. Yeah. It's actually funny. I was something I wanted to tell you. Um, when I was 15 actually just right down there and there was a recruiting center, army, marines, Navy, the whole bit. And I was 15. I, I tried to enlist in the marines, you know, cause like I, I, at that point I was already, I was very, I guess I had a lot of pent up aggression, you know, and I was just like, oh, I just want to fucking, you know, I probably shouldn't say this. It probably sounds bad for the military, but I just wanted to kill this one. I just wanted to fucking kill. And I wanted it to be able to, like, I just was so fucking, ah, you know, and it didn't help that my mother was a hippie. So, you know, just, it's natural for a teenager to rebel against everything their parents believe in. I mean, I had like fucking recruiting, you know, catalogs and shit under my bed, whereas most kids probably had, you know, their playboys and shit. Like my mom would find my ribs, every critic shit instead of like holding up the fucking, you know, Ben, I was raised by sudden to me, no soldier get on their fucking hippy fucking,

Speaker 6:          00:33:46       there's, there's a lot of guys in the military. So I'm like, fuck this. Through the years, you're 100% right, Chris, through the years, there's so many guys in the military and you meet some guy and you're like, hey, how's it going? And you, you know, you learn their last name at first, but then you know, you get to know him a little bit and you're like, you know, oh, what's your first name? And they'll be like, oh, my first name is rainbow. My first name is, you know, ocean. And then they go, yeah, my parents were hippies, you know, and, and so many kids rebelled against their hippie parents. I'm going to [inaudible] I'm going into, in the seal teams, that's a very common, so you're 100% right. It's a good way to rebel. And I even say this, you know, for me, you know, hardcore was a rebellion. And, and going in the military, for me, it was a rebellion against the norm. You know, was everyone's going on a, I'm going to go be a Hippie, smoke dope, uh, go to college, get a job. And I was like, no, I'm going to go be a commando and just get after it. And Fuck you. So, you know, it's fucked up because it's like,

Speaker 4:          00:34:48       had I followed those instincts, you know, I mean, you know, in some ways my life would have been probably a million times better. I know how to add a lot more, you know, uh, discipline. I would have had a lot more focused. I would have had more positive shit, you know, going on. I would learn some skills and shit, but at the same time I wouldn't have fucking written age aquarelle I wouldn't have written best wishes. I wouldn't have influenced people like you would it be, you know, to go above and beyond what the fuck I could ever fucking try to do. You know? So it's like, I feel like in, in my own way, I, I managed to do my service to, you know, humanity if you will. You know. Although it was a disservice and a lot of ways, because I did inspire a lot of people that do a lot of really fucking wrong shit,

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       you know? But, but nonetheless, the inspiration that the, it was real, it was genuine. I think that's why a 30 years later people still give a fuck about that record and people are still out making money on that record and you know, people still cover songs off that record. You know? And, and it's funny cause I was telling you earlier, he's mean that lineup that played on that record only lasted for one fucking record. You know, it's amazing how short it is a long time, you know, and it's like, and you know, it was something special because still now 30 years later people are still talking about it and not many people can say that based on one fucking album. Yeah. You know, so it's good shit.

Speaker 2:          00:36:21       Okay,

Speaker 6:          00:36:24       I got it. I'm just going to go like you were talking about your neighborhood, this is just kind of a sample of what you were living around and in back to the book, I remember one night lying there hearing some chick down the street getting raped. Yeah. And knowing there wasn't really nothing to do. It was like a helpless feeling. You knew that if the cops got called, it wouldn't matter because they probably wouldn't show up. And if they did, it would be too late and they probably wouldn't find her. Yeah. One night my mother's then boyfriend got the tip of his nose almost shot off by a zip gun. He has a scar to this day, just because he was white, looked a little freaky and was walking down our block. I remember coming home one night and my aunt and my mom, my aunt and an Gustafson, the stimulators basis got jumped by six dudes with golf clubs and shit trying to pull her guitar out of her hands. You don't really think about a group of guys jumping two chicks and a kid, but that shit happened. They didn't give a fuck. You've got to figure, a lot of these guys would hang out and huff glue and shit. And when you have glue and you smoke a lot of dust, you get pretty grim and lean towards the violence. Yeah. So there's your, there's your surroundings, there's your environment.

Speaker 3:          00:37:39       Yeah. I mean it's, you know, it's, I'll tell you, man, it's, it's a,

Speaker 2:          00:37:46       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:37:47       It's almost harder to hear it being read back to me now, especially in your voice. But, uh, but it's like, you know, it's real and eh, it brings back a serious emotional response in me. You know,

Speaker 6:          00:38:07       you know, as I was reading that, I was just thinking of myself because you and I, you know, in the scene there was always guys that had dogs, right? Pit Balls, everyone had pimples. And as I was reading that, you know, you and I both know if you take a pit bull and you bring it up and you beat it and you've torture it and you heard it, that dog's going to be a mean evil bastard. And if that dog's brother can get brought up and get fed and get care of and you know, sleep, it gets treated good and that, that dogs and grow up and be nice and, you know, just thinking, you, you take a person, a human being, and you put them in an environment where that's what they're living with and that's what they're seeing and that's what's around them. They're going to tend towards that direction. Yeah. And it's gonna be hard to break out of that shit.

Speaker 3:          00:38:52       It is, you know, and, uh, it's, you know, look around at the world, man. You know, look at all the, all the fucking ghetto was everywhere. Look at all the, you know, all the, you know, a lot of people don't get outside of this country, you know, they're live here, so when people don't realize how well they have it. Yeah. Yeah. And even, you know, I used to laugh, I was talking to my friend Melly Mel and uh, we were saying, I was saying, you know, I don't even understand what the fuck's up with all that. Like West Coast Gang Bang and shit. I mean, these guys, they, first of all, they don't even have to deal with winter.

Speaker 6:          00:39:33       The second fall, they all got like yards and garages and fucking barbecues and Shit. Like we grew up in like apartments with fucking rats and roaches and you know, concrete everywhere. And you know, what the fuck are you so pissed about that you need to go and shoot at each other and kill each other? You that fucking bored. Like, it's just, you know, it is an interesting dynamic here in New York City the way it is. That's why I didn't touch it. I mean, even now that it's like, you know, soft his fucking baby shit, it's still intense. Yeah. You know, I like, I just, I feel confined when I'm here, you know, now, now, now, now that I've grown up, when I come here and I live in [inaudible], I live in California and you're right, I got a yard and I got a barbecue and my neighbors have yards and they say good morning.

Speaker 6:          00:40:34       And it's like, you just, you have space. Space is a real thing. And animals, you know, you can't put an animal, a little tiny cage, they get pissed off. And that's what we do with 8 million people in New York and put him in a little tiny cages. But it's her getting pissed off, especially when, you know, the good majority of them were broke as shit. Yeah, yeah. Uh, but this whole time as you're doing this, at the same time, you're still, you're listening to music, you're going to shows all the time. And like you said, the bad brains show up. You know, that was a change. That was a game changer. They were as groundbreaking as far as for me. They, they sh they rocked my world as much as like the sex pistols. Like they, it was like all of a sudden it was a new chapter.

Speaker 6:          00:41:21       I, uh, you know, and the way you wrote, you wrote about the bad brand. So the bad brands, for those of you that don't know, it was a band from DC and they were pivotal in changing music. Really a generation of music, new, there's all kinds of bands that referenced them, like big bands and reference a bad brands. But here's what you said about the bad brains. It wasn't just one thing. Go ahead. For those who don't know. They were not only one of the innovators of, of what we call hardcore punk, but they were all black and they were from DC and it, you know, there was not many black kids on the scene. There always was black kids on the seat. It was always Puerto Rican. It was always everybody, you know, we always, it was always mixed diversity on the scene, but they were like the best.

Speaker 6:          00:42:05       They were the tightest, they were the best. They were the fucking, they were this shit man. And a lot of times when people first heard their first 45 you know, just because of the style of the music, people didn't even know they were black and they'd go see them and be like, Oh shit, these guys are black now that may not seem like a big deal. Now we're talking about fucking 1980 yeah. You know, and yeah, they would just the fucking, they were the shit man. And then they got into Rastafarianism and that, you know, even further made it even more bizarre. A bunch of fucking rosters from DC plan hardcore. You know, what the fuck is that? And playing it better than everybody. Like fucking smoking motherfucker. Yeah. You know, uh, you know, I think if you've got to see the bad brains back in the day, you're lucky.

Speaker 6:          00:42:51       I mean, I remember seeing the bad brains and just being, you just, it was just sick. It'd be like seeing James Brown back when he had Bootsy Collins on base, like back in the old, like when he was like all over the, I always used to like an HR to Lake James Brown meets Johnny Rotten. You know? Here's what you said back to the book. You hear a lot of crazy stories about HR. Hr is the, the singer from the bad brains, throat in the bad brains. But as crazy as HR can act at times, back in the day, he was inspirational beyond belief. He in the bad brains had the entire New York hardcore scene, hardcore scene talk, talking like fucking Jamaicans. For the longest time, everybody was like firebrand and blood clot. That's hysterical. It's like the mob. We're so heavily influenced by them that the bass player started growing dreads and wearing a Rasta hat.

Speaker 6:          00:43:43       A whole contingent of white rosters started popping up on the hardcore scene. They took things to another level. It was impossible not to be inspired by the bad brains. The only way to describe HR would be like James Brown meets Johnny rotten meets Bob Marley. He was such a dynamic front man. Hr could do a standing back flip and land right at the end of the song, nail it right at the last beat. It was like, oh my God, did he just planned that? I remember one time at a seven, which was a tiny club within the first two minutes or so of their show, he had already knocked the sheet rock ceiling out and bent the mic stand in half. The amount of explosive energy that would come out of that motherfucker. You couldn't help but be blown away, especially since we were all young and here was this guy that was in shape.

Speaker 6:          00:44:26       He used to be a javelin thrower back in high school. He was always athletic, so he had a bunch of scrawny punk rock motherfuckers and then this dudes up there that was an athletic powerhouse going completely ape shit and he could sing his ass off and he could hit notes. Hr came out there with a purpose, like he was on a mission. Every show I saw of theirs back then was amazing. I remember when I saw him up in Boston one time and he was like going, he, there was, I guess like fire pipes or whatever, uh, uh, sprinkler pipes and he's leaping up and swinging on those things and jumping off into crowd. It was nuts. He was a motherfucker

Speaker 4:          00:45:02       man. He spent half the show in the crowd like he was. Yeah. You know, you can't, you can't, he just can't even, you know. Yeah, man, they was something everybody has that moment though, that, that period where they really, you know, well not everybody, but everybody who's like intense, you know, you know, you think about your life, you can think of that one period where you were just fucking point.

Speaker 6:          00:45:34       They were around. I was like 16 and it ended like last week. All right, well did last [inaudible] some of us. But

Speaker 4:          00:45:48       yeah, there was a period when they were just fucking untouchable and, and you know, have you seen HR now? Yeah, I've seen him over the head. You actually like seen him talk to him? I, last time I spoke to him and he came out to my house was probably around 2011 or 2010 and you know, he's definitely, you know, he's, he's got some issues, you know, he, he has suffered some serious, so he has like, um, mental issues, you know, I mean, I don't know what his diagnosis is. I'm not going to stand here and pretend to know, but it's, but you can tell there's a clear change that that guy from the guy, now there's something that is definitely a psychological difference, you know, and I, you can't just blame it all on drugs because, you know, some of us have done plenty of them and they're fine.

Speaker 4:          00:46:39       So I mean, some, you know, there's something, you know, and, and it's really, it's really sad. You know, their plants, I don't know. I don't know when or what they're doing and playing. I mean, and God bless them, you know, I mean a doctor, no, you know, he suffered a stroke and a heart attack and he had to like learn how to use his hand again and, and everything. I actually did a benefit, uh, show us a record that's available on pledge music. It's the only place you can get it. You can't even buy it in stores. And, and 48% of the music goes to help him just help him also, you know, to whatever he needs help with. You know, cause God knows he's pledged music. Yeah. What do you search? Pledge, pledge music. Harley Flanagan. And the song will come up. It's the, one of the songs is called friends like you and um, but anyway, yeah. I mean those guys were intense. I mean, it will never be what it was, you know,

Speaker 6:          00:47:31       I'm, I'm glad that they're doing their thing, you know, whatnot. But I think my memory of them is from that period. Yeah. And you probably saw how many times did you see that

Speaker 4:          00:47:43       it's unlimited because I have no idea. I saw them so many times. I saw them out on the west coast and

Speaker 6:          00:47:49       you know, excuse me. Yeah, I saw him in Tiawana. Oh really? Yeah. But HR wasn't with them,

Speaker 4:          00:47:56       so it was kinda like, oh cool. But not that cool. No offense. Other singers who were really doing great dudes, great singers. But it's really hard to follow in someone's footsteps. I mean, that was a rough hospital. That's a rough fall shot.

Speaker 6:          00:48:11       So meanwhile you did a trip to England. This is the first time you saw skinheads before?

Speaker 4:          00:48:19       Well, I saw, I was getting hired, I got my head shaved in Ireland. I had seen skinheads one time before in London, but I didn't know what the fuck they were. I was just like, what the fuck? Like I could know that there was something, they had an interesting look like they, you know, and, but the shaved head thing was what got me and uh, yeah. So I, I met skinheads in England in the 70s, but I got my head shaved in Belfast and 19

Speaker 6:          00:48:43       dean 80. And here's what they told you, going back to the book, I always remembered what the Belfast Skins told me, teach America about skinheads, the first few friends of mine to shave their heads and included Adam Yauch do that from the Beastie boys and a few others who weren't really skinheads in the stereotypical thug way. They just liked the look and the music. I mean we were all into the early oily style music cockney rejects and bands like that even though it wasn't really called oil yet. The two tone thing was happening with all the Ska bands jumping off like the specials and selector and madness. And they were all popular with the skinheads early on, but there still wasn't a skinhead scene in New York. Just a few friends of mine who were up on it both in a couple of years. All that would change. So, obviously the, uh, the, the typical person when they, that doesn't follow the music scene at least at, at a deeper level, when they think skinhead, the immediately think of sort of the, uh, the branch that went off and, and got the most press, which was the, the Neo Nazi skinheads. But the original, the origins of the skinheads is actually black dudes, rude boys, Ska bands like the specials and madness. And that's kind of what you saw and, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:50:09       I mean, I actually talk about a little bit of that in the book. I give a little bit of the historical information just to give people a clearer idea. Um, yeah. But, you know, the media always let latches onto whatever is most sensationalistic. You know, they'd to always grab the worst aspects of, of what people are doing and, um, you know, yeah. You know, it's, you got it, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:50:39       Yeah. I mean, I'll, I'll say one more thing. In the New York scene had always been more diverse than most hardcore scenes that always been Spanish kids, black kids, Asian kids. A lot of the early New York hardcore skinheads were Spanish. Yeah. Mojer from agnostic front, which if you don't know agnostic front is probably, they might be considered like the, Oh, they're definitely one of the biggest sort of skin head bands from America. And they were absolutely the first real like New York skinhead and you know, I mean, but uh, yeah. You know, and he's Cuban logic. I mean Diego was Puerto Rican as was Jose from the mob and so were a lot of skin heads that came around later. Even back in the Maxxis days, you had the bad brains, pure hell, that influence or one of the first real New York hardcore bands and they were all black.

Speaker 4:          00:51:24       Yeah. I think where you just pulled up, I was just talking about the diversity on the scene in New York. New York has always been different from other places as you know, you, you know, it's one of the things that's cool about it here. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:51:38       I could say, you could say it's fairly diverse here in New York City. Fuck, this has got to be one of them. I bet you the, I don't know, you'd have to look at this, but in New York City, one of the most diverse places in the, on the planet, it's as far as like different languages spoken. I mean, one thing I noticed that, you know, you can eat any type of food here by a people. I mean, we had moved here like three weeks ago. That's one thing I always loved about it here. Gangnam style, uh, dumplings, dumplings, dumplings in Sushi, served by, by Gangnam style. Oh, actual guy. Oh. And meanwhile, you know, at this time back to the book, I was drinking a lot huffing glue, taken pills and lots of LSD and whatever else. So this whole time, that's what just prevalent in the scene. Drugs and New York was a very much, um, are seeing like to, to get fucked up in DC. They, where they invented straight edge,

Speaker 4:          00:52:48       you know, they were, they were all about being clean and sober and, and God blessed them. And uh, you know, that caught on like wildfire and other places, you know, uh, the straight edge movement spread and whatnot. And we always went the extreme opposite. We were like, are we, you know, they had a song, don't drink, don't smoke, don't fuck. We used to sing, you know, we've, we drink, we smoke, we fuck, fuck you. You know, and um, yeah, a bunch of fucking idiots. You know what I mean? W you know, unfortunately, you know, at point in my life

Speaker 6:          00:53:27       and in the hardcore scene, it was often cool how fucked up you could be. You know, and I'm sure it's that way in a lot of the world, in a lot of youth culture and in a lot of, you know, cruise and gang culture and you know, I don't mean to theorize, but I'm going to do it a little bit of philosophize with you. You know, like cultures that back in the day or some cultures, even today when you want to prove that you are, we'll sacrifice yourself for the tribe a little bit. Like I'll go hunt that line or I'll go out and do something that's hard and I'll take risks for the group and I'll prove that, that, that I don't care what happens to me. I should have been in the police. I think that, hey, I'm going to prove that I don't care what's happened to me.

Speaker 6:          00:54:16       Watch me drink this, watch me, shoot this, watch me smoke this and whatever. No, I agree. I think that that instinct that's still in us doesn't have a place to be used properly. And I'll tell you where I got that philosophy from in the seal teams, man, when I came in, it was like the way that you kind of proved that you were tough was drinking and fighting. Right. Take everything to a fucking extreme. If you fucking drank five, I'll drink 10 yeah, you fought to motherfuckers off fight fucking five motherfucking. That's what it was. And when the war started, did not like that stopped cause that stuff still goes on. But it definitely in my mind, in my mind, I was thinking and we still drank and we still partied and got after it. But it was different, man. It was different to all of a sudden be saying, hey look, you know what?

Speaker 6:          00:55:07       I need to prove myself as on the battlefield. I need to be ready for that. And so I, I, when I apply that to like all of society, it seems like a young kid like you who's 15, 16 years old, how do you prove that you're tough? How do you prove your manhood? Oh, you think you can drink 12 shots? I'll drink 20 exactly. Every thing. And you know, you talked about like the straight edge moving and those guys, it's interesting if they took it to another level too, they stopped fucking name until they stopped paying then fuck. And then how did they prove? How did they then prove that they were tough? They would go out and fight and beat up people that were drunk and shit like that. Well that's what started happening in some scenes. And then because like in DC, those guys were always, they always tried to be more PC.

Speaker 6:          00:55:53       They always had a little bit more consciousness. But in a lot of other places you had bands like, you know, you got, I got in trouble with Ian Mackaye remember when removing Food Gazi came on this. So for Ghazi, one of my buddies from DC, this is, and the dirty and one of those guys, one of my buddies, one of my buddies from DC, they sent me a demo tape. He's like, Hey, this is, this is eons new band and you're quite a few thousand. No, I was like, cool, that's a great album. Great. Um, and so we went and saw him in Brooklyn, me and my boys, we went down to Brooklyn Museum and we went berserk because he wasn't feeling it. He had like longer curly hair and, and he's standing there and he put it like they play their first song and we just cleared out destroying everything.

Speaker 6:          00:56:43       He was like, Hey, I'm just trying to think of what he say. So he knows I'm not bullshitting if he ever hears this. He said something along the lines of like, let's leave her, let's leave our machoism and our egos at the door, you know, if you're gonna dance, be cool or something like that. And so then I was like, dude, what do I do now? I get music, rocks, I want to break stuff. And I couldn't, so we just, I remember when he started going that route and you know what, God bless him and you know, and he has always had it

Speaker 4:          00:57:13       integrity. And as he, as he matured, you know, his his way of thinking.

Speaker 6:          00:57:21       Yeah. And you know, you gotta respect. I mean, you held the line with what he did, his record, he never sold out. You know what hat's off for sure. He's fucking legit man. For sure. I got the first wreck for him now at this time. And you used to break his balls. Fucking relentless Lee though. But that's just the way I am. If I, if I, if I like someone in respect of, chances are I'm going to really fuck with them whenever I have the opportunity, you know, so yeah. Um, so fuck you. Uh, the, at that time you, you kind of came up with the name of the, I actually came up with the Cro mags name and you started like tagging everything with the old match and where you had a kick ass. I was like, when we talked about my first, the hardcore band called Bronson's children. First thing we did no music but we made tee shirts.

Speaker 6:          00:58:17       They can merchandise. So we, you know, that's what we did. And you were doing the same thing, just different as you could actually play music. And I was just, uh, let me see where we're going with this one. So you started, you started coming, putting together the band and then things started getting a little bit crazy. You beat someone up who's some friend to someone else and all of a sudden you heard that you had like a price on your head. That was actually before the Cro mags. Really? Yeah, it was pre chrome. It's like he made up the name. But you were nothing. Yeah, that's actually why I

Speaker 4:          00:58:54       wound up, I'm heading out to California. I had to take a little break from my neighborhood. Yeah, it was pretty intense, man. This dude, I'm all right. There was a gang on my blog called the hit man. And this is back in, you know, I remember them from the seventies through the eighties. I mean, this is when they still used to wear colors, you know, patches on there. In fact, the Puerto Rican gangs looked more like bikers, like Puerto Rican bikers without bikes back then. Like they all had like patches and jeans and like Mc boots and you know, they'd wear like the f true pats and total old school, you know, like, you know, uh, wolf tails and shit, you know, lack of for college. This is like ridiculous shit. If you look on old youtube and then old photos of New York gangs, it'd be like, okay, that's what he's talking about. Yeah. Anyway, yeah, these guys were fucking, they were no joke. And one of the hit men was pig man and he, you know, they did hits, they weren't called the hit men, you know, because they, you know, ro hit songs, you know, they, you know, they, besides selling heroin, they, they did hits and, uh,

Speaker 5:          00:59:59       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:00:00       Pig Man. I've known about him my whole childhood. He was like a lower east side myth. Like, you know, everybody had heard of him but no one knew. Ya know, cause if you saw him, that was most likely the last thing you saw, you know, but he would wear a pig's mask. That's why he was called pigs pig man. And he would pull up in his blue Nova and fucking blast you with a shotgun. And it was that simple. And they actually kicked in a friend of mine's door and put shots in people's mouths and guns to their heads. Whereas Harley in one of the skinhead apartments looking for me and they came to my squat and, uh, pulled someone into a corner and put knives to their throats, which departments Harley in and pig man was cruising by my friends with the mask on and didn't see me.

Speaker 4:          01:00:48       So kept driving I guess. So it was real. And uh, I'm like, I was like fucking 15, you know, I mean, I'm 15. I got fucking pig man looking for me. I mean, that's fucking no joke. This is big man. Motherfuck Gino Man. And, uh, I'm like telling the locals, I'm not black. I'm like, shit man. And My mother lives on 12th Street. We know what the fuck. I don't know what about her. I don't worry about your mom. Everybody loves your mom. This, this, this not personal man. There's money on evolve, you know, it's his business, but you should get outta here, man. You should hang low. These are your four to Rican brother is telling you this. Yeah, I like the guys on the block. Just people who knew me from school. Like people like my friend's uncles and shit like that, you know, like dude, you should get the fuck outta here. So I'm like, you know what, I think I will. Yeah, just that's cause you beat somebody up. Yeah, I used to, I used to get in a lot of fights and I used to also, you know,

Speaker 5:          01:01:45       okay,

Speaker 4:          01:01:45       yeah, I beat someone up. And it turned out he was, uh, it was this guy who was a one owner of one of the after hours clubs. I'm the lower east side and a lot of these after hours clubs like you know, save the robots and the pyramid and all these other places. They had like no that like they will the late night freak clubs where everybody would go like to a six in the morning and they would all be doing blow and doing coke. So I guess that's how they knew the hitman because they all used to, all the club freaks used to buy all their drugs from the Puerto Ricans and the neighborhoods. So we were kind of fucking up their business too because we were like fucking up all the, all the new freaks that we're starting to come to the Lori side, all the new white people that we were like, you know, fuck you, we just made this motherfucking neighborhoods safe now you motherfuckers all thank you.

Speaker 4:          01:02:27       This is gang busters. Like your just the flood is fucking fuck. This is our neighborhood now. So yeah, you know, I was an asshole. I mean, I, you know, I have to admit that, you know, looking back, if you know, if you're ever going to man up, you have to be able to say yes, I wasn't an or, you know, but that shit. Yeah, pig man was no joke. And I went to California and the shit died off. I came back, dude, you went to California and I was reading that part of the fucking, I said, what in God's name is going on to talk about the bats. Yeah, man, we were living in an abandoned brewery. Uh, there was, you know, a couple hundred kids live in there. Probably. We were all living in the actual vats that they used to have the rubber coated in square rooms, like with a man hole to get in and out of.

Speaker 4:          01:03:17       And you know, we were living in the Air Vance and yeah, it was fucking crazy man. And everybody was fucked up on drugs. Everybody was a runway. Everybody was, you know, it was, um, what amazes me about the eighties is the lawlessness, you know, in New York and in San Francisco, you know, like you could really get away with just about fucking anything and they would be like, no police involvement, no repercussion, you know, I mean, you'd get into a fight and the shit could go on for a half a fucking hour, like from one area to another and back and forth. You know the guns will fight. Yeah. Like, I mean, you would fucking start fighting on avenue a, you'd end up on first avenue over on seventh street, then back over to eighth street and back down to avenue n and it's like mad screaming and you know, stabbings and bottles breaking and no cops, you know, that it was like, you know, I mean shit happens now man. You fart too fucking loud on the street here and you got arrested.

Speaker 4:          01:04:22       I just, so you're 15 years old, you live in, in a, in a, in a vat in San Francisco with a bunch of everyone's running away. Matt Crystal Meth, fucking shoot and crystal left, right front and center, drop in liquid acid in their eyeballs. How's that even like how do you process that? And the other weird thing is, is like you're surviving, you're, you're, you're getting food to somehow, right? You're stealing food, shoplifting and panhandling and mugging people, figuring it out, figuring it out. And that's what everyone in this vat, these vans are doing. Yeah. Well, I mean there was only a couple of us that were out mugging people cause there was only like me and mark dagger and a couple of other people who were like hardasses everybody else was either out panhandling or turning tricks. You know, it was like you, you, you, you know, you were either out Mcginn someone sucking a dick, begging for change, you know, and um, did you just think like, okay, this is what life is like?

Speaker 4:          01:05:31       Yeah. That's what life was, you know. I mean, I remember like eating at soup kitchens, you know, with like adults and I'm like 15. And that being weird and like almost getting into fights with like dudes who were like ex cons and you know, like dudes were just got out of prison who were like to them, they were still in the prison lunch room, you know? And to me I'm just like trying to, you know, get some food, you know. And uh, yeah, it was, it was pretty intense, you know, I mean, but to be fair, I had a great fucking time, you know, I mean I had a lot of fun, you know, the debauchery, the violence, the drugs. I had a fucking blast. What? I recommend any of it and know what I wish it on my kids or my worst enemies. No.

Speaker 4:          01:06:19       Did I have a great time? Yes, I did. How I fucking made it. I don't know. But you know, I guess it's, I guess is that like when people talk about, well, when people say to me, Oh, I think this is the same thing cause I'm sitting here going, how can that be fun? But I guess, yeah, no dude. People asking me about like being not thinking about the most intense situations you've been in. It's like the adrenaline, the fucking, ah, like dude, the last time I got in like a real fucking crate. No, not the last time. The third or fourth. The last time I got a really bad violence situation, like the one it's in the book when I had like, I fucked up this dude who was in a gang and the next thing I know I got like 30 dudes fucking coming after me with pipes, bads pop up, Bah smashing out our windows and I'm running into the crowd of them to save a friend of mine now.

Speaker 4:          01:07:09       She like, dude, I was fucking like high for like a week off of the adrenaline. And then when I finally came down and I was like, Whoa, what the fuck was that man, I have died, you know, but like for literally a week after that shit, I was just like, yeah, you know, and, and you know, that's like, but that's the difference between certain types of people. Like, you know, I will run into a fucking violence to save a friend and a lot of fucking people that I grew up with, we'll fucking punk out. I've seen people that I respected fucking run and leave their friends behind and there's some real pussy shit, especially when they're trying to be all bad ass skinhead.

Speaker 4:          01:08:00       You ain't nothing but a bitch, you know? And um, and hey man, you know, and that's one reason why I'm really fucking proud to be here. You know, because it's like you guys, one of the things I respect the most is someone who will put themselves on the line for someone else. Like when you will put your own life at risk for another person. There's nothing more admirable than that. So hats off to you guys and to all all the military out there, you know, serving this country and serving their brothers, their sisters, their families, and everybody, you know, hats off, man. It takes a lot of fucking balls and I respect and I'm not, you know, even law enforcement, you know, and I'm not a big fan of the police in many surf. I've, I've become friends with a lot of cops since I started doing Jujitsu.

Speaker 4:          01:08:59       Jujitsu changes a lot of things for the policy. However, you know, I still have my reservations, but I respect again, anybody who is willing to put their life on the line for others and for the greater good and you know, and there's really nothing higher, you know? Yeah. Well like obviously I got my work with the police and they're the same way, man, they're there and they got, they got the, one of the hardest jobs in the whole. Look, I say that with, you know, a little bit tongue in cheek, you know, I mean, it's like I've grown up always being on the shitty end of the stick when it comes to the cops. And you know, still to this day, even like when I'm trying to get something achieved and accomplished and I try to go to them for guidance, they still look at me like they want to slap the cuffs on me more than fucking help me out, you know?

Speaker 4:          01:09:45       So, you know, but you know, some friends, but I do understand, you know, I what they deal with on a regular basis, so I get it. But I also think that a lot of people are attracted towards lines of work that give them a, a position where they can abuse their position. You know, I think that happens in human race though. I mean, it's not, it's like a go do a ride along with some cops, man. It is, I couldn't do it man. The cops is just the, what they deal with on a day to day basis, what it does to the brain, you know, hard ass job. People don't understand. I mean it's like there's a certain level of, uh, you know, once you've seen some, some shit, you're always on that edge, you know, and that fight, that fight or flight, you know, and unfortunately they don't have the choice.

Speaker 4:          01:10:41       They have no choice but to deal with at a fight. So, you know, so, and they got to protect. You don't have to, of course you see, oh all we always see the negative thing of trying to work within certain guidelines and that makes shitty parts. End of the time they're there going, no, Hey sir, please put the bat down. Put the knife down. That's what we're doing. Nine days, you know, socks to hard ass job harder. But you know, again, I got, I, you know, I also got to play, uh, I gotta keep my one foot grounded in the streets. I still have my you, you were

Speaker 6:          01:11:14       uh, yeah. You're conditioned. Yes. From your childhood that the man you are is more on the other side here on the other side, man. Exactly. On the other side. And so now that's how you're conditioned us. Just like when they, when they see you. Well, I don't know if they see, see you now. Well, you know, things are a little different now, but you know, hey, you know, what the fuck are you going to do? Well, I'll tell you what I do when the cops tell you to do something. Oh, I'd do it. I don't fuck around. I'm like, look it up. No problem. No problem. That's how you make friends. I see my stupid fuck. The feds were like, Yo, fuck that blah blah blah. It's like fuck's wrong with you. Oh, you had to do was say yes sir. How fucking difficult does that, you know motherfucker, he that stupid. Yeah. Um, man, we haven't even gotten to like the chromatics yet. Have we? Who? The chromatics Oh yeah. Like putting together the first album. You know what I mean? Shit.

Speaker 6:          01:12:18       So you guys finally get together here. We go back to the book. It had been three years since Paris and use of Paris. The guy was a, he was the guitar. It's stars from the Cro mags hooked up and started writing November 2nd, 1984 and on February 16th, 1985 the cro mags went into high five studios on 27th street and Park Avenue in recorded 12 songs. The age of coral cassette, which has released on CD called before the quarrel. Yeah. That was the original version of the album before we actually went and recorded the album, age of coral. So that's 84 that that's going down. Yes. And that's a good recording. I have that one too. I actually like it a lot better than the album I was telling you before. I can't tell him I, I, someone's granted my head that I expect little things that aren't there. And so I, I I liked the first one better cause I think it's this more raw.

Speaker 6:          01:13:15       It is more, we know that it's more explosive. I think it's more true to what we actually sounded like when we played live, you know? Yeah. The other thing, the other one had, you know, a lot of productions shit that I wasn't too happy about. But yeah. So now this is where now you think the story has been crazy so far. Echo, I'll just throw you under the bus right now. That story has been crazy. Now it goes, just takes another kind of what I consider this an even more bizarre turned and everything we've talked about so far. So going back to the book, I was into Vegetarianism, but it took me a while to get into Krishna. At first, John, this is the the singer from the Cro mags or one of the singers that sang the cro mags. John and me used to go to the trucks where they served free food and comp comp can square park, which wasn't big hangout back in the day and everyone used to go there and hang out.

Speaker 6:          01:14:07       A lot of hardcore kids did. I mean I was living in a squat, I was vegetarian, I had no money and here was free vegetarian food. They also had a few preaching centers on the west side that me and John used to go to to eat, but still it took a while for to give a fuck about what they were saying. I was there for the free food. I wasn't looking for religion, I was just hungry and trying to survive. We would always show up late. John would tell us when the good time was just to get the food after the reading and preaching and everything. But over time I really started getting into the philosophy. In the beginning people didn't take John and Christina. Seriously. It was kind of something the hardcore scene laughed at. But as my friends and me started getting into Krishna, it started to change.

Speaker 6:          01:14:50       So you guys started getting into Hari Krishna? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Which is pretty funny. Looking back now, tell me the fundamental philosophies. I mean obviously Hari Krishna's are vegetarian. Yeah. Cause they don't want to like hurt, you know, animals. The actually, it's more to it than that. That's actually not why. It's because now I'm going to start fucking talking to all their shit. Well gimme a little bit of it. They only eat food that are offerable to God. And you can't offer God a rotting carcass to eat. Okay. You know, there's, there's nothing that has to do with like, hey, we don't want to hurt things. Oh there's all this karmic stuff. You know, everybody likes to, you know, not make more Karma for themselves, good or bad. See, that's what I'm saying, like this is why this is why it gets more bizarre to be, yeah, see that's the thing is with the amount of Karma I had already hated myself. I was not trying, but this is where it gets even more fun.

Speaker 4:          01:15:47       The up and twisted because you got me and my friends who were like recovering skinheads for lack of a better way of putting it. You know, dudes who he used to go out and get in like, you know, 20 fights in a night, you know, put 19 people in Icu just because you know, just walking from the east side of the west side, what you look at it, ah, you know, fuck you out all night. Just fucking wild and you know, and then all that shit with pig man and this and that and God knows how many other things, you know, how many bodies I've found and came across and, and you know, how many, how much madness I had it experienced, you know, like we were talking about, you should know. It's like sometimes, you know, when you're dealing with life and death on a regular basis, you know, sometimes you're like, you know, God, you start calling out the god, you don't even know what the fuck guide is and you're just like, God, help me God, you know, please, you know, guide me, help. It's this the call of f of desperation, you know? And, um,

Speaker 4:          01:16:50       I would have never been into Christianity and this and that. I just, it all just sounded like a bunch of bullshit to me. And here I was actually hearing some things that made some sort of sense to my teenage mind, you know, Karma, Ooh, you know, all these other things that like were like resonating me, you know? And it's like I needed that shit. You know, I needed some sort of guidance. And had I not had something like that, I mean, it could have been fucking Buddha, it could have been whatever, you know, but I needed something that was greater than you needed to some kind of guidance. And you're like, I need guidance. I need discipline. I needed hope. Hope. Yeah. You know? And when I started going out to their farm for a little while, like they were getting, we were getting up at like five 30 in the morning and meditating and watching the sun come up and like it was like this whole, you know, it going from like being like hunted by the gangs in my neighborhood to that. It was just like, I can't even really explain it. It really, it was like,

Speaker 5:          01:18:04       yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:18:05       I don't know how to fucking put it man. It was just like, it was like, here I am at peace. I was going to say, it sounds like people might for the first time like wow, you know, so that, but then the more I was involved in it, the more I seen, you know that people in religions in general or are typically a bunch of fucking hypocrites, you know, you get a lot of people preaching a lot of shit that they don't all fucking follow and all rules don't really fit all people. You know, every human is different and not everybody can follow the same guidelines. And, and when is, when did things start becoming just belief in what the fuck is belief anyway? It's just what you choose to believe, you know, unless it's like, this is real, you know, this is really cutting my face. That's really blood. This is, you know, I really have to eat food and breathe. Air Belief is just that, you know, I know I still have, you know, my spiritual inclinations. I still believe in some sort of, I don't like to say the word God anymore because I don't, I, I, I don't have that overview that I know any fucking thing. I just know,

Speaker 4:          01:19:25       I know I got a lot of love in my heart for the people I care about and I know I want to try to do good things. You know, I've done enough bad things.

Speaker 5:          01:19:35       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:19:36       I'd like to try to

Speaker 4:          01:19:38       prevent some people from experiencing what I experienced. And at the same time I would like to share the, the great experiences that I had with people, you know? Yeah. Well, one of the, one of the great experiences and one of the things, the great things that you shared to people is that that album, that album, and we'll go to here, going back to the book, the age of coral, some would call it one of the most, if not the most influential New York hardcore and albums. It was recorded and mixed in under 100 hours over a 14 day period. January, February, 1986 at east side sound by Steve Remote and Chris Williamson, our manager and so-called producer. But it was really Steve. So 86 comes around and you guys put together the age of coral. Yeah. This is the, the one that got released on a big scale is like the first, that profile.

Speaker 4:          01:20:33       Yeah. It was probably one of the first hardcore records to ever be put out on a real major label. Like something that wasn't like discord or w slash records or something underground. Yeah. And, and now this is, you guys are, you guys are starting to get a big draw. I mean huge draws outside of New York City. We were starting to tour at this point and doing, you know, we, our first big break was touring with Motorhead and then we got, uh, you know, we went on to play with many other metal bands at around that time. The whole crossover thing. Yeah. For those of you that don't know crossover, when he's talking about that, that's the crossover from hardcore to metal and kind of combined, it was really want to have a metal heads started discovering hard. Right. When people like Metallica started wearing Gbh shirts and coming to see the chrome eggs.

Speaker 4:          01:21:27       Yeah. When people like anthrax started daring to come to CBGBS. Yeah. You know, and that's really, but the hardcore bands started getting more metallic. Yeah. Because like metal heads started shaving their heads and getting into hardcore, like the kid, like yourself, like kids who had been listening to Don Halan, they were little who started getting into hardcore bands, started getting more metallic. We, we definitely to be, I mean, did agnostic front. Yeah. Know, they, a lot of people tried to jump ship, you know, I guess I don't, I say that kind of jokingly, but I guess, you know, it seemed like there was more opportunity to actually make living bigger on a bigger audience, you know, actual record deals, you know, Pantera, Pantera, fucking great band cause Pantera, me and one of my favorite bands probably, you know, dime bag, uh, fucking love that dude. One of the worst tragedies imaginable, uh, to, uh, music is motherfucker got shot on stage for and buy a fucking psychotic fan.

Speaker 4:          01:22:32       I mean, it's like, you know, like the fuck man. Yeah. That was awful, you know. Yeah. It's uh, yeah. I mean not to, not to talk about, not to get into, you know, the whole chrome mag beef and this and that. But like one thing I will say is, you know, it really bothers me that a dime bag died like that and that they never, cause I know they would have buried the hatchet by now and they would have done an amazing that the union tour and they would, if they would have just kicked the shit out of everybody and they'll never have that opportunity now

Speaker 6:          01:23:06       because he was robbed from us. And to know that my band or search a bunch of stubborn, immature fucking old ass holes that we can never actually embrace each other purely based on what we did achieve together and how many fans would be so happy, you know, because once, once you're gone, you're gone. And you know, it's very rare that four or five people will have that chemistry for a moment in life. So, you know, just based on that alone, it's pretty fucking sad and pathetic, you know? Yeah. And it's weird run that you guys have, cause you guys, you guys, you guys were on the verge. Yeah. I mean, yeah. And, and when I w you know, when I remember you guys, um, touring and I didn't see you on the age of coral tour cause that was a really fast talker and you went yeah and I just didn't have the opportunity to see you but uh, I saw you on the best wishes tour, which was the next album that came out and you guys were big.

Speaker 6:          01:24:10       I mean you guys were just to kind of put it in perspective for people. Like I think the, the places where I saw you play, and this is kind of a national brand is the house of Blues. If you've ever been to house of Blues and I saw you a place that was as big as the house of Blues, I used to play there. Okay. I didn't know you actually played there but like that kind of venue. So that's in my mind, you know, that's legit, that's abandoned that venue, you know what I mean? When you're playing places that size, you can make a living and you, and if you keep going and stay consistent, you know, you can do fairly well for yourself. But now, now this is the key. So, you know, age of coral comes out. You guys are popular, you toured Europe, you know, you're getting after it, you're filling up places. Uh, best wishes. You're filling stuff you're headlining. Best wishes. Put your playing with Motorhead to before. Yeah. You're supposed to play with black Sabbath one time. Yeah. By the way, that would actually be the ultimate show of all time for me. Have to fucking agree. Right?

Speaker 7:          01:25:05       Cause my favorite bag, yeah. Black Sabbath didn't show up because they were having some issues. But uh, yeah, that, that was awesome, dude. I made it on a flyer with black sand could die down. But here's the crazy thing is I was reading the book,

Speaker 6:          01:25:32       I couldn't believe this. You come home from those tours and there you have no money. Yeah. Yeah. And you hear this, this is kind of like a rock and roll myth, right? Oh, the guy signs the contract. If the producer, and I've watched a bunch of, of, uh, uh, programs about this and what the, what the record companies do is they say, hey look, we're gonna give you a hundred thousand dollar advance for your next album. And then you go, awesome. So they give you a hundred grand and you start spending it, you, and then they back charge you for your studio time and the, and next thing you know,

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       literally at the end, you haven't even gone onto it. You owe them $25,000. You're working to pay it off, they lend you this money with interest. And so that's the kind of shit that was happening with you and you come back off these tours. You're famous. Cause also at this time, now that I think about it, you and the Cro mags, you guys were like on the cover of like the metal magazine, all those stupid metal magazines, man, you'd term they'd be like skid row on one page and us on the next [inaudible] you're like, I thought, fuck yeah. Is he on one page? Me On the next, yeah. So you were there. I mean, yeah, we were on the cusp right about to break it, you know, and you were still broke still. You would come home from his tours and still be living on the streets.

Speaker 4:          01:26:48       I would, I would be coming off those stories and trying to figure out where I was staying or I'd be showing up at my grandmother's house, you know, or I'd be like, yeah, we got pretty fucked man. But you know, you don't know what you don't know. You know that. So it's like when you're a kid and uh, you ain't got no guidance, nobody looking out for you, you know, you make a lot of mistakes. And also back then they had a bunch of better monopoly there. Here they're nowadays how to screw you. You can say, Oh, you know what, I'll just make my own record and I'll be able to distribute it through the Internet and social media, all this other stuff. You know, that would have been helpful in those days as far as you know.

Speaker 2:          01:27:31       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:27:32       But, um, you know, I think that the Internet and everything is also really kind of fucked music up because it's like people don't have to have any, uh, lineage or any, a connection to their roots anymore. It's like people who don't know anything could just Google it and cut it and paste it and call it their own. And the next thing you know, they're an artist and it's like, no, you're not a fucking artist. You're a fucking cut and paste and motherfucker who hasn't ever actually experienced the fucking thing and you don't even know the history of what you're imitating. You just know that you're into it right now. So you're imitating it right now. The other crazy thing is

Speaker 2:          01:28:04       okay,

Speaker 4:          01:28:04       you know.

Speaker 2:          01:28:05       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:28:06       It was hard to get like these records when I was a kid. Yeah. You had to know you couldn't order them. Yeah. You had to like get somebody that was going to go to New York and hey, if they have this album, can you pick it up? Or you go to Bleeker bobs and grab it. And it was like that he couldn't just, but nowadays you can if you say, oh the chromatids are cool cause I heard a song, you put them into Google, you get cro mags, you get every other band that's been related to them. You get bounced at Sam like them and you can just download them all the media and it's no factor. It's kind of crazy. That's why for me, like you know how many record total record albums I had and I loved music, I probably had like

Speaker 2:          01:28:44       okay

Speaker 4:          01:28:45       80 records, right? 80 records on my computer right now on my phone. I probably got 10,000 records. No cat on all kinds of songs. Right. Every band that's ever existed. I got him on my phone. Then you, you would shit if you saw my fucking would shit. It would fucking be like, like a kid in a candy store man. You fucking him. Cause I got everything from back then. I got it all. I got like Motorhead test pressings I got like you're one of those guys gets test Fresno. I was watching some video with the Rollins Rollins and he has my first single, he bought it from me. I think he might have one of the most epic record collections that he likes. Weird stuff like stuff that like I wouldn't want it, but he's got, you know, first pressings test pressing. He's a freak and he's got money too, you know, he's a good dude.

Speaker 4:          01:29:41       Yeah. You end up trying to try to sue a little bit. I think he tried to sue the record company or something and you end up just going into legal cost. What trying to happen was we were trying desperately to get off of our record label and get away from our management because we got to a certain point where we were just on the verge of blowing up and profile was, was still treating us like chumps, you know, we weren't getting no money, we weren't getting anything. We were getting treated like fucking dog shit. And I'm someone who was working at Electra was interested in signing us. So we were like, electro Metallica, here's our fucking shot. So we like got to file profile middlish right. No profile was actually a hip hop label. So what they did with us was really kind of out there out there because they had, you know, their big band with century media that came after no profile was big for run DMC.

Speaker 4:          01:30:35       That was who there and then like rob bass, it takes two. It takes do that was like there, there was big, that was their hits run DMC was their main shit. Speaking across over run DMC. Yeah, they brought the metal. I mean, you know, those guys were great man. I saw that first year played so many times back in the day. I remember seeing them with the Beastie boys at the garden and that was a fucking great show. It was fun, man. It's like the Beastie boys brought all like the, the little white kids and run DMC ball, the black kids and the black kids with his walking round Robin all the way fucking pick off like watching people just get yoked like an I, I, I'm like, this shit is hilarious. It was 40 oh damn. So you're trying to get off that label and trying to get on to electric dam cause electrodes.

Speaker 4:          01:31:26       Yeah. Yeah. That would have been a good move for us. But um, profile didn't like us and they would have rather taken, you know, they couldn't offer them enough money to give us our freedom. They were like fuck these dudes. Yeah. Yeah. We had some issues with some of the people there. And then you end up so with uh, with Alpha Omega, and by the way, I didn't say this but you sang on best wishes John. I sang on like half the album more or less. You know. And then me and John both sang on iPhone Mordoff Omega and I got to read this from the book cause I got a kick out of it. Oh boy. Theory goes back to the book. You know how you can always tell when a heavy band is starting to lose their edge when they start using a fucking keyboard. Yeah, we did that.

Speaker 4:          01:32:22       All right. To be fair, I was eating a lot of mushrooms that they recording session. So like things sounded a little bit different to me and they were sounding the keyboards, how to cool man. I was eating all kinds of mushrooms and drinking mushroom tea and I was like, yeah, that shit sounds cool to roll with that, you know? Was he at least I can look back and laugh at myself? You know? It's like if you can't fucking laugh at yourself, man, you're an asshole. And some other, I think I might to breeze through it. But there's another point where you were talking about how spinal tap ish, like all this and even that spinal tap is right. We just started. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:33:08       So Ed, did you want to hear some really fucking funny? I mean the me and Doug watched spinal tap with John one time. Just, just, just to show you a little bit about his intellect. All right, we'll watch it. And about halfway through that movie, John Turns to me and done goes, Yo man, these guys suck. I've never even heard of them. Why did they make a movie about them? Mean dog is look at each other like this mother thinks this is a real documentary. Oh my fucking, anyway, sorry. I had to, hey, you know what I've seen, I've seen spinal tap twice live. Oh, I saw them once. Yeah, I have a spinal tap lighter. I brought my wife and you know when they play big bottoms all play base basis. Those are fucking brilliant.

Speaker 4:          01:34:01       No, but I remember like being in those clubs where you would find trying to find the stage. You're walking around and you're like, all right Cleveland, Cleveland. You're like fucking outside the club. Yeah. Uh, now you're still and you're still struggling. I struggled up until pretty much not that long ago, two weeks ago. Like I said, he wrote, you wrote here before I get into this next chapter, I'm telling you that I had to lose a lot of stuff from this error cause I have kids now and I don't want them to know exactly how insane things got or to think I'm a worst piece of shit then they already will or do. But again, this is proof that you can plumb it to the bottom of the worst depths of hell and still come back and try to become a better person. There was enough filth, drugs, or gs violence and crime during this period to write a book about nothing

Speaker 6:          01:34:58       else. As insane as it was. And as much fun as I thought I was having deep down, I was looking for a way out. I think that's why I took everything to such an extreme. I don't think I cared if I lived. There were times I don't think I wanted to. I'm not proud looking back on it now, if anything, I'm sort of surprise. I survived.

Speaker 2:          01:35:27       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:35:28       Heavy. It's fucked up here. And you read that Shit Bro. Like it makes me go. Hmm. But yeah, man, it's true. You know, you know, I've seen some of my friends

Speaker 2:          01:35:45       that

Speaker 6:          01:35:47       they, they start to, I think get the same outlook and they start doing shit that is, uh, not, you know, high survival rate activities. Yeah. And it's like they're walking that line of, you know, well, it's kind of like you want to die, but you're not going to take the pussy route and kill yourself. So you're just going to do everything you can to kill yourself without actually putting a rope around your neck. So instead of putting a rope around your neck, you put a rope around your arm and stick a fucking needle in it, or you know, smoke dust until the world is just a fucking illusion. You know, I'm going to read this right here because this is, this is, you know, here you go back to the book. At one point I was

Speaker 1:          01:36:35       broke. His Shit. This is after you have three albums signed by a major record contract toward all over the world, played with Motorhead on tour. Here we go back to the book. At one point I was broke as shit and I got busted shoplifting food at a supermarket. I didn't have any ID, so the kids I was with ran back to the house and came back with three of my CD covers his ID. I was sitting in this holding area in the back of the store and the store cops were looking at me all confused. They were like, this is your Id. I was holding up pictures from the age of coral best wishes and Alpha Omega and I was like, see, look at the picture and look at my tattoos. This is me.

Speaker 6:          01:37:12       They were like, you're kidding, right? This is all the id you got. That's, yeah. I didn't even have a fuck. I had no idea. I had nothing. Dude.

Speaker 1:          01:37:23       I just realized that I completely breathe. Breezed over. Is that I'm saying that you had this record and you had this record yet. You're also a sick bassist. I mean like an unbelievable basis. You know, like, like she had this incredible musical talent. You play drums too, but I mean your bass playing is drama, but that's well and good. But your base plan is sick. So he had all this talent and you had records and you had fans and you had all the shit and you're still down in the down in the dirt, shoplifting, shoplifting,

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       fucking smoking ice dude. Hey Man. You know, it could've been worse, man. I mean, look at fucking people like Jocko Pistorious. I mean that mother fucker was like the most spaces. Yeah, like the, and Jimmy Hendrix, you know, he was the Jimi Hendrix of base and look at Jimmy and him and it's like, you know, you can have all that talent and if you're, you know, if you're suffering on the inside, man, you know, me and fucking Jocko, there's another tragedy. Motherfucker got beat to death by a balancer. You know, who didn't know who he was. This is not this Jocko, Jocko Pistorius. He actually got tried to get up on stage at a Santana show him because he was friends with Santana and he tried to get up on the stage and he was so fucking messy at the time that nobody could recognize him. And the bouncers threw him out and he kept being belligerent and they beat him to death.

Speaker 4:          01:38:47       You know? So it's like you can have all the talent in the world, but you know it's, it's this, it's sad because really the people who are have that gift usually are people who are really emotionally well that's why they have that gift because they're so fucking emotional, you know? I think you know that definitely. Then that can really become destructive if you don't have a positive place. Like if you're really, the only times in my life where I haven't been all fucked up on drugs was when I had something constructive to do something that gave me a purpose. And when you have that creative, emotional

Speaker 4:          01:39:27       self destructive thing in you, because it really can become self destructive if you don't have a place to put it. I mean, shit man, if you wouldn't have fucking gone into the military and God knows what the fuck you would have done with that intensity. No, the military I've talked about that, you know, I mean it's like it's a beautiful thing for me. Yeah. I mean you probably would have been for me too. I just wound up. But you know, in, instead I wound up being a soundtrack to your yeah. But a lot of, a lot of fighters, you know, a lot of UFC fighters and stuff and a lot of those guys have a rough time, you know? Absolutely. It's hard to be that type of an intense person and to go to such extreme emotional dumps because, you know, one second you're just a tough guy on the street. The next second you're a tough guy in front of fucking thousands of people and there's lights flashing everywhere, you know? And then, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:40:22       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:40:23       And then some people, it's like your career has done and you're still that tough guy who still will fuck shit up, but nobody gives a fuck. And now if you fuck somebody up, you're going to fucking jail. You know? And it's like, you know, and drugs become an easy way to deal with fame and the confusion of popularity and the depression. It's a heavy thing to go from,

Speaker 2:          01:40:45       ah,

Speaker 4:          01:40:46       to the silence of your room and your mind. There's a buddy of mine plays in a band called slightly

Speaker 6:          01:40:54       and they're actually a big band. And they play in front. They're from San Diego and one of the guys in, and he, you know, we were just, you know, he's got a little kid, he's a normal guy, but he plays in a slightly stupid and he was, you know, they just got back from tour and you know, I just said something to mud. How wasn't he goes, man, that just never gets old. You know, getting up in front of 10,000 people that are singing your songs, man. He said, it's just like unbelievable man. I tell you, man, I haven't been in taught on tour in a really long time and, and um, last time I gigged out.

Speaker 3:          01:41:28       I think the last time I did a tour was like 2011 or 12. And then a lot of shit went south in my life. Go figure. And I needed time to pull myself back up and get my shit back together. I'm going on tour in about nine days. I'll be playing in Berlin first. I'm going to be playing a bunch of shows in Germany. I'll be playing in Venice, in Italy and I'll be playing in Switzerland. I believe in Belgium and the UK. I'm going to have about 13, 12 or 13 shows and 13 or 14 days. I'm really, really looking forward to this. Um, I'm not looking forward to driving five, six hour drive, so I'm not looking forward to not sleeping in my bed. I'm not looking forward to not waking up next to my wife. I'm not looking forward to all that shit, but I'm really fucking looking forward to doing my thing again. You know, I got so involved with Jujitsu and teaching Jujitsu and stuff, that music actually started to take kind of a back seat, especially when I had my kids and I really couldn't tour and stuff anymore. Uh, why? It was a choice I made. I mean, I could have done whatever the fuck I wanted, but I chose to be there for my kids. Now they're older and so on. And Life is, uh, has made this possible to do again. I can't wait man. And um, you know, this

Speaker 2:          01:43:12       okay.

Speaker 3:          01:43:12       Affecting people the way I, you know, you do with music, it's a, you make a connection, you know, you know, you, you know, look man, I'm sitting across from you now because of a fucking album I did 30 fucking years ago. Was that fucking tell you, you know, it's good.

Speaker 2:          01:43:29       MMM.

Speaker 6:          01:43:30       You're going back to book here. You're, you're at that point, you know, you, this is know the same time period where you're getting arrested for shoplifting.

Speaker 2:          01:43:41       Okay,

Speaker 6:          01:43:41       here we go. I was in a state of depression and the drugs helped me stay in it. I was trying to get better as far as wanting to get off drugs at least half the time, and I would for a few days or a week or so here or there, but I was just too depressed and one thing would lead to another. Then back in to the abyss, the death spiral into emptiness, nothing and nowhere ness. Of course I was all into Alice and chains and nine inch nails and all of that fucking depressed drug music. But even as fucked up as I was,

Speaker 2:          01:44:17       okay

Speaker 6:          01:44:17       there was this wheat grass juice stand on mission and I'd still make sure to go get a shot of wheat grass juice every day because I figured, hey, at least wheat grass juice is equal to eating tons of vegetables. But I was trying to sort of stay healthy. Like I was like, okay, I know I'm not eating regularly and I'm not eating very well, so let me at least try to, you know, and this is, this is another thing that's again I think this Georgia state. So I go to monkeys, Dorothy heroin and fucking wheat grass juice.

Speaker 2:          01:44:57       Horrible.

Speaker 6:          01:45:03       I'd go to music stores and pretend I was going to buy shit and just play instruments. I'd hang out as long as I could and then leave. I actually got offered gigs while I was playing in stores. I got offered gigs for doing sessions for different producers, but I'd be all fucked up and miss the session cause I wouldn't know what day it was. And then realize a day or two later I'd boot lose their business card or whatever. So you just can't get your shit. I was pretty fucking, it was embarrassing. And that was by the way that was taking place out on the west coast.

Speaker 6:          01:45:33       It sounds like. I went to San Francisco to clean, get clean off drugs. I was like the worst city. Fuck I clean. I haven't you ever heard of Idaho or where you're new to checkout Idaho or Montana? Uh, thank you. Move back, move back to New York and now you start kind of bringing it back together. I'd go for these long runs at night cause I couldn't sleep. Uh, your girl lived down by the twin towers and I'd run from there to central park and back on the way it stopped by Coney island high on, on Saint Mark's place to see who was hanging out for a few minutes. Say Hi then keep running uptown to the top of the park. I'd run a few laps around the reservoir and then turn around and head back down on the way back down. It stopped at Coney island high again and there would be the same people. Everyone was pretty much in the same place, just slightly more shit faced and had hang for a few more minutes and then keep running. It was kind of good to see that as I was getting my shit together to see all these people not really doing anything but standing around getting fucked up as they got older and did nothing with themselves. It gave me motivation to keep my shit together.

Speaker 2:          01:46:38       So

Speaker 6:          01:46:40       yeah, that's when I started pulling myself back up. You know in one of the things that

Speaker 4:          01:46:48       helped with that, first of all, you guys got def jam, you guys got signed to Def Jam, is that right? We had a, they gave you an advance or something, but we got an advance to record something for them and then the deal wound up falling apart. So we wound up

Speaker 4:          01:47:01       being left with the recordings in our possession that we were able to then put out ourselves what, what album was on revenge. Okay. Which I thought was actually a really good album, but, um, you know, it is what it is. But didn't think shit, never managed to stay together. That band just had fucked up Karma and all around this time you started your Jiu Jitsu career. Yes. Yeah. Well that's, you know, I, I've said it many times, man, Hanzo really fucking saved my life and a lot of ways cause uh, you know, even though I was doing those, you know, 12 mile runs and shit like that, I mean, I've worked my way up to really do one long ones. I started off doing like three, four miles. I got into it, but I would still have my moments of just like a depression and um, just, and I'd want to get fucked up and stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:47:58       But I had Jujitsu and, uh, I was living in my rehearsal studio. I didn't even have a fucking shower. I was like bathing on the roof with filling up a two gallon buckets. I'd go up there were like four or five buckets and just like babe, I was living in the rehearsal studio. I wasn't, you know, life was not great, but every day I'd go and I'd train and uh, that gave me a place to, uh, to find myself again. You know. When was this, what year? Uh, it was like January, February of [inaudible] 96. Okay. Like when I've came back, I discovered a MMA from UFC one and two when I was out on the west coast. And I'm like, what the fuck did he just do to him? Like, I would probably, you know, hit a thousand people in the face. I kicked the thousand people in the head and the head butted and bitten, whatever.

Speaker 4:          01:48:55       But I ain't never seen a triangle choke thought fuck is an arm bar, you know? And I made up my mind, this is when I was still on smack. I was like, I made up my mind. I was like, Yo, if I ever get the chance to learn that shit, I'm gonna fuck them, learn that shit. So when I came back to New York, I just kept going through like black belt magazine, Kung Fu magazine. Like one of these motherfuckers got to move out here sooner or later. This is New York. I mean they can't all stay in California. They fucking room Gracie's they're like a very big family. One of them is going to have to move out here. So Hanzo get moved. I found an ad, Enzo Ku cook, Gracie Kukoc had said Gracie Kuka Yeager's still with his old partner and yeah man, I went down and I met Hanzo and that changed my life and I was 21 years ago, you know, and, and a lot of people are, they think I why they think it, but they think Jiu Jitsu is going to be, you know, kind of when you walk in it's going to be intimidating. And it, you know, I could tell from the way you wrote about it hands, I was just like, Hey, what's up broad, you know, he just makes you feel so welcome and so at home. Yeah. And um,

Speaker 2:          01:50:05       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:50:06       He's, you know, I can say this and mean it. You know, I, I really loved that man. You know, he, he was there for me through some of the toughest parts of my life and he didn't give up on me and he believed in me. And sometimes really that's all you need is somebody to believe in you and did not give up on you. And, um, you know, when I got arrested in 2012 and I was all over the papers and the news and everywhere, you know, they, a lot of people were shying away from me. Let's just say that. Um, for those of you who don't know, I got jumped by about five or six guys. Uh, and I wound up biting a nice chunk out of one of their faces and slice in a couple of them and poke and one of them and the process of the me getting jumped, I got 40 stitches.

Speaker 4:          01:50:58       I was stabbed. And, um, you know, a lot of people were like, you know, I can't believe he did that, blah, blah, blah. I'm like, did what got jumped? You know, I got fucking jump man, the fucking telling me about slice and cut and stab it and fucking telling me shit about shit until you got five or six motherfuckers trying to take your fucking life, you know, then you can start talking about how could you do this? How could you fuck you? You know, you got five dudes kicking you in your face, stomping on you. You had better be willing to stab it, bite or rip someone's balls off. You know? And that's what people don't fucking understand, who have never experienced real violence or real potential of death. Uh, you know, when I first got into Jujitsu, it was all about the fighting. You know? I was like, yeah, learn more ways to fuck people up. Yeah. I now I really, it's, it has nothing to do with fighting for me anymore. I mean, I just love the art. I love the relationships that I've made through the art. I love sharing what I've learned. If anything, I'm a

Speaker 2:          01:52:10       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:52:11       Again, you know, the fight or flight man, I'm way more likely to run then fight at this point because I know

Speaker 4:          01:52:20       how bad things can go. Yeah. You know like yeah definitely. I actually, I might have told this story before, there was a bad ass marine and his name was Da. That's what everyone called him and da in, in the military DSLR for short, for direct action. But that was his initials too. But it just, so it just worked and he looked like a superhero. He's a total stud and he was a gang banger from Texas and, but you know, he joined them or even to be like you. Right. But he joined but he's a black kid. But he joined the Marine Corps and he was in force recon. He was a total bad ass. And I, and I said, hey man, you got to come and try Jujitsu out. And so he started training. They like, after like six months, he came up to me and I was like, hey man, you know, cause I was like still deploying and he's, I wouldn't see him a lot. Nice. Almost like a mad how you, how do you like Jujitsu? He was like, man, it's kind of fucked up.

Speaker 7:          01:53:16       What do you mean bro? It's, it's awesome. He goes, he goes, no man cause I used to feel like a real bad ass. Now everybody has to you I'm thinking about, I might be a pussy. So yeah man

Speaker 4:          01:53:28       it is funny. It's very humbling, very, very humbling game to play. It really is. But you know at the same time though, to me it is, it is that though it is a game for me. It's like when, when I think of fighting or when I think of,

Speaker 2:          01:53:46       okay

Speaker 4:          01:53:46       self defense, I, I I I believe in Jujitsu. I mean I am 100% of believer but

Speaker 4:          01:53:54       Jujitsu is fun for me. It's not about violence or self defense or fighting, you know, cause he's fighting and violence to me is about ending something is ending. Somebody, you know, I mean cause I know I could die. It doesn't, I tell people all the fucking time, I'm like, you know, you don't got to worry about like uh, you know a blackbelt kicking your ass. Cause he's a black belt. He's already matured past the need to kick your ass. You got to worry about that 90 pound mother fucker who will stab you without you even having a chance to say, dude, we don't need to have a problem. Right. You know, you got to worry about that dude who's just so don't give a fuck that before you even have a chance to say buddy, your shirts wet and you're like, oh shit.

Speaker 4:          01:54:44       You know? Yeah. And um, right. We've talked about that on here. You know, people say like, oh I was going to get no, this guy said something to my wife, what should I have done? I'm like, just to grab your wife, go home and buy her, you know, a nice dinner and yeah, I say, honey, I love you. You don't, I don't, it's not worth getting stabbed in the neck and it's not worth having to stab that junky in the neck either. And I just know from my own experience that there's always the potential that I could go to that extreme. I don't think for one second because I'm a Jujitsu black belt that like, I'm just going to submit this guy and hold them down until the police get here. Because you know what that guy may have through other friends standing in the shadows behind you or that guy may fucking start stabbing you when you're looking to fuck and you're trying to, you know, submit him

Speaker 7:          01:55:27       and all of a sudden you're like, why? Why is that

Speaker 4:          01:55:31       shirt wet? Well, you know, why is my pants wet? Oh my God, that's fucking red. You know? I mean, that's just life, you know? That's, that's why, um, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:55:45       now as good as Jujitsu isn't as good as you felt doing it, you go on tour and just before we go on to where you break up with a girl at the time, blah, blah, blah, back to the book without the feeling of being needed, I didn't feel I had much purpose in my life. I started falling back into fuckup mode. I was seeing several different chicks around at that time. Hey, you wrote the book and it's wrong. Correct. Done on her. I'm Craig can, you know, it wasn't even so much over just a breakup of a chick. I was actually, I've been with this chick for a while and she had a daughter and I had raised her daughter. Oh. So it was like, you know, also not just feeling like betrayed and everything else that goes along with a breakup. But as any father or step father stepmother, you know, you have a certain, uh, you know, you develop love for a kid even if it's not yours, you know?

Speaker 3:          01:56:43       And that was really what was a hard on me more than anything because the mother was all fucked up on drugs and I had actually taken the kid from her and I was raising the kid for her while she was off just being a fuck up. And then the grandparents and me gotten contact. So I wound up doing, you know what? You do it again. This is your family, this is your blood. Thank you. Got To grow up with your family. So that was, that's why I was struggling, you know, it was because it was like, you know, I was, I never had a father that gave a fuck about me. So every time I've been in a child's life, it has really mattered to me. He liked to be, uh, to protect them because no one protected me, you know? So, um, so that was why I really started to lose my way again, you know, cause I was like, you know, uh, I don't have a purpose. There's no one for me to love no one for me to care about and knowing the field, uh, my, my love, you know? So yeah, the drugs started to fill in the gap again, you know, but fortunately that didn't last forever.

Speaker 3:          01:58:06       It's funny, man, some of the fucking, some of the toughest motherfuckers actually got the biggest hearts. And that's what a lot of people don't realize is, you know, I'm sure that underneath this rugged exterior, you're quite a sensitive motherfucker, you know? And, um, are you talking about me? No, I'm talking about the guy behind you. But, uh, you know, I mean, seriously, some of the most eldest motherfuckers I've known in my life have been some of the most sensitive people on the inside. And I think that part of that illness has been a shield, you know, to protect themselves. I know it probably was with me and a lot of ways, you know, if I wasn't as violent as I was, my neighborhood would have devoured me, my environment would have devoured me if I wasn't as,

Speaker 1:          01:59:01       Yup. So to your point, I agree with you and that's one of the reasons why I think going back to Jujitsu or boxing or wrestling or Moy, Tai, but win win

Speaker 1:          01:59:17       you me when we're kids, young men, going back to the whole thing about proving yourself, how are you going to prove yourself that you're tough when you're a kid, you go out and you fight and you beat people up too stupid. You do stupid stuff when you do Jujitsu, you know you're tough and, and you know when you look at some guy in the street like, Hey, that guy might stab me, but if he doesn't, I'm going to, I will choke them out and to take me 15 seconds so I don't have to do anything to prove. That's why I think it's for me. And I think it was Tim Ferriss asked me this question, he was like, what makes a man or something like that. And I was like, to your point, for me, learning how to fight. So learning, Jujitsu,

Speaker 1:          01:59:58       getting married and having kids and going into combat, those were the three things that I was like, okay, those three things. They were evolutionary to me and they were the three things that happened where I said, okay, I don't have to walk around trying to prove myself to this guy or that guy. I know how to fight. I don't even know need to impress that girl over there. I got a girl, you know, and I got and I got mouths to feed so I can't act like an idiot. And I know I'm not a coward in if shit goes down, I know that I will do the right thing. I know that 100%. So those were the things that to me gave me like security as a man. And so it's the same thing that you're saying how, you know, when we're young and you're out there just to try and prove and, and protect and shield your, your emotions, your sensitivity, you know? Yeah. That's what you do. And so a good way to get over that in my opinion, is you, instead of having to fake it, you learn it for real. I wish I would've had Jujitsu when I was a young kid. That would have helped me immensely, you know? Yeah. Um, well I mean, just to just, just

Speaker 3:          02:01:04       one person not just mentioned briefly is, um, high end Gracie, uh, another brother that I, I truly love. And uh, you know, he died in 2007. It was a very tragic, and um, here's a guy who was feared by 99.9% of the people that knew him. And the 1% of people that knew him fucking loved them. And he was, you know, it's like I'm saying like, you know, you got these people who are fucking dangerous motherfuckers. You don't even want to look at them wrong or for too long, you know? But if they fucking love you, man, nobody better fuck with you. Ever go there. You got a part in, in the book where you're talking about he came home, he fought in Japan, he comes home, he gives you, you know, you just had your first kid. It gives you two grand. Yeah. If for not for nothing, just for being you. And I didn't want to take it and he's like, shut the fuck up. It's for the baby.

Speaker 3:          02:02:08       You know? I mean, I know motherfuckers my whole life we didn't do that for me. You know, you know Dean Dean lister, who's, you don't want one of my friends and training partners and all that, but he's got some funny stories about high end and he's like, hi. It was fucking crazy back. He was a crazy motherfucker. But, but, but to be honest though, I never had any crazy experiences with them because I feel like when he looked into my eyes, he knew he didn't have to prove anything to me. Yeah. You guys kind of countered it out. What's that called? Is canceled. Well, it was like, you know, I don't have to prove I'm a bad ass to you. You don't have to prove you're a bad ass to me. Let's just go out and chill. That's good. You know, we'd go out and like go to stupid movies, like, you know, go out and just work on his English, you know, like, I never, you know, yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:02:59       We had fun, you know, but we never like gotten brawls and got know. But I mean, you know, he died. Yeah. He got, uh, he got arrested. It was a bad situation. You know, again, it's like, you know, again, this is somebody who was very emotional and a sadly, you know, like many people started using drugs as a, as a way to deal with shit, I guess. I don't want to say to deal with shit, but maybe just as a little bit of an escape, you know, you've got to figure what kind of fucking, uh, you know, I mean his favorite song was a boy named sue by Johnny Cash and he really felt like he was living that life by being him, you know, with the name Gracie and having to be, you know, always having to step up, always having to prove himself and always having to be a bad ass.

Speaker 3:          02:03:51       And I think that when you're forced to react and deal with things on that level all the time, and especially when you are actually a nice person at heart or, or a sensitive person at heart, when you're forced to always take that stance as shit to fucking tough one man, you know, that's a hard road to travel. And um, you know, I always have him with me always. I always have him sitting on one shoulder and hands, oh, sitting on the other. And uh, you know, when I look back on it, yeah. When I have big, when I am confronted by, you know, serious shit, I think about, you know, how one would react and how the other would react. And, and then I tried to find my own sense in there. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:04:38       I mean it's high. It's kind of a classic example of everything that we're talking of. I mean, yeah. For all, for all practical purposes. You shouldn't be here right now. You up either dead or in jail or whatever. Yeah. And he did his shit that was going down the same path, but he didn't, didn't make it to make it happen, you know? And uh, that's, you know, that's the, that's the thing, man. I feel really fortunate that I had music because I think that it gave me a tool to, to, uh, it gave me a paddle to row my wave through the shit.

Speaker 2:          02:05:09       Okay.

Speaker 6:          02:05:09       But it also came with its own load of shit. You know, it's funny cause I, you know, I probably should have encouraged my kids to learn more about music and be more musical, but I encouraged them to be Jujitsu guys because I felt that, you know, MMA is way safer. Better. There's less. It's less off road. Yes. Bad exits. You can know, you might get punched in your face it bunch of times, but at least you want, you know, at least it won't be life punching you in your face, you know, and there's, you know, all kinds of drama around it. You described it to get a spinal tap, you know, just the rock and roll crap. Cro mags comes to an end for the most part and you end up putting out outer record Harley's war. Yeah. And um, good, good rock and roll music baby. And uh, now and also during that time you, you had some kits. Yeah. And you know, you, you met the mother of your kids and she wanted to go to school and so you took off some time to just, yes. I pretty much put my musical career on hold. Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:06:28       You know,

Speaker 6:          02:06:30       to take care of your kids. Yeah. And uh,

Speaker 1:          02:06:35       you know, one of the, one of the paragraphs that you wrote in here is awesome. Um, talking about your kids and you say, and this is something I completely related to, I'll tell you the first time I looked down at the other end of the mats and saw my boys training. It was one of the greatest moments in my life. My youngest son spent his birthday at the Academy with George Saint Pierre and all the rest of the fellas. My eldest son had his birthday there with all the Gracies in about 30 kids, a full house and a cake with a Henzel Gracie Academy logo on it. My sons have grown up with Hanzo like an uncle Igor halls, Gregor, Daniel, Neiman, all the guys treat my boys like family. They've known their instructor Magno Gama since birth. He came to the hospital to see them hours after they were born at Hanzo.

Speaker 1:          02:07:21       They have known since they were days old. My oldest and I have been on Greyhound buses in the middle of the night traveling hours away to represent RGA and team hands. Oh Gracie. I've competed with my son's net at nationally ranked grappling submission and Jujitsu events. One of my proudest moments was when we both competed at the same event by son took first place in his division and I took second place in the expert Masters Division in the 30 to 35 year old age bracket. Although I was 44 hens. Oh joked when he first saw my son. This is the proof that even though the fruit is rotten, the seed can still be good.

Speaker 1:          02:08:02       That's uh, yeah, we, we all know that one. And you know, I, I guess it's when you see your kid doing anything that you love doing and you see, get to see your kid do it, Echo, you got that in your future. When you see your kid, I'll wait. [inaudible] you see your daughter on the mat right now and uh, that, that's cool. When you see your kid like training and I'm to the point right now, my son's a big kid. He's 14 but he's, I can roll with it, man. I can legit that can roll with that taller than me. Yeah. He's my 14 year olds. Six foot buck 80. Yeah. Yeah. And it's awesome when you, when you get to train and you know, the other thing I noticed while I surf and when my son as good as it feels to surf like as good, there's a really good feeling and you serve as good as that feels.

Speaker 1:          02:08:55       If feels just as good, if not better, to be paddling back out after catching the wave and see my son just, just, just getting after it and it's so awesome. It's like you sometimes you sit there and watch, you know, I'll just take the opposite watching him and, and you try not, you try to like contain yourself movie. It's just so awesome. It's so cool. And, and you know, you see, you know, I got a bunch of daughters too and seeing them do when they, it basically when you see your kids kicking acid stuff, man, it's man, it makes you feel fucking good. You know? I mean you see them doing positive and shit specially man, cause God knows, I mean, I've done so much negative shit.

Speaker 3:          02:09:35       They, when I see my kids doing something positive makes me feel really good. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:09:44       Going back to the book, Talking About Your Dad, my dad, my father died from a fire. So you, your father, your father and we didn't talk about it much. He, he'd gone away and then he'd like, had intermittent contact with you over the years actually, once he was out. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:09:57       my life. I, you know, when my mom left him when I was real young, you know, uh, I never saw him again and I own, we actually spoke to him twice on the phone. I got like one letter from him and it was like one or two pages and a cassette of him playing guitar in a halfway house. And, um, basically just apologizing a lot. And uh,

Speaker 1:          02:10:31       yeah, you know, he knew he made a lot

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       of bad choices, but, um, that's fucked up though because you know what I mean? Uh, he was all, you know, he's fucked up on heroin and he was an alcoholic. And, uh, he, he actually, uh, like kicked my mother in the stomach when she was just like very pregnant with me, you know? And, um, yeah, that's how much he didn't want me. So, you know, it's a, it's a hard pill to swallow, you know, when your father would rather be strung out on heroin then be your father. But, uh, but I, I've managed to, uh,

Speaker 3:          02:11:21       turn it around, you know, cause, uh, I love being with not just my kids, but I, I teach the kids at the ends up Gracie Academy. And, um, so the childhood that I didn't really have, I get to experience and live vicariously through all these other kids and I get to be a role model to them. Where as I didn't have any. And you know, I'm teaching these little boys and little girls how to defend themselves and how to fight, not to fight and have honor and how to lose with honor and always to shake their opponent's hand and say, good job. Whether they win or whether they lose and how to have that respect for their opponent as well as themselves. You know, when I teach these kids that, you know, there's like they say a Jujitsu, there's no losing in Jujitsu. You win or you learn.

Speaker 3:          02:12:16       And when I can take a kid who, you know, I've worked with a lot of kids who have um, you know, varying degrees of spectrum disorders where there they've had autism or physical issues and to see the improvement that they make, not just at Jujitsu but in, uh, in their social skills. Uh, you know, kids who are so insecure that they won't look at you and now they're making eye contact with you, talking to you to life, change your face and shaking your hand and, and their chest is out and your shoulders are back and they're not all, you know, that, you know. So where I didn't have certain things, you know,

Speaker 3:          02:13:03       at the end of the day it gave me something else. It gave me the ability to value that, that relationship that you can have with children that a lot of people take for granted. A lot of, I even get disappointed with a lot of the parents that bring their kids to Jujitsu cause I feel like, you know, you're a lot of people hand their kids off to everybody else to teach him how to do everything. You know, they don't work on stuff at home with them. They don't sit there and teach them. They don't. I get, you know, when you have a kid that doesn't know how to do a fucking jumping jack, you're like, what the fuck did your parents do with you? They don't roll around with you. They don't teach you how to do a somersault. I have to teach you, which is your left and your right hand.

Speaker 3:          02:13:45       Like really, you know, I don't think people value that time enough. And I have said it before, it's like, you know your, your, your job made, your career may change several times in your life. Your spouse may not be your spouse for, but your kids are always going to be your kids. So you really have to cherish and value that and the time that you spend with them because they'll always be your kids. You know, that woman that you think you're in love with may leave you, you may fall out of love, your job May, uh, you know the fold, but your kids you to be your kids forever and they'll always need you, even if it's just emotionally to know that you're there. Even if they're not seeing you every year or every six months or even if you don't speak to them, they, you know, you still have to be here and emotional and spiritual backbone even from afar. You know, I had no, I mean, you know, I forgive you dad. Yup. You, uh,

Speaker 2:          02:14:59       yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:14:59       When he died, you actually flew down to Texas to a

Speaker 3:          02:15:04       yeah. Basically the barrier, the barrier and that, that was cool too. I got to finally meet his mother and, and learn about my father's side of the family. So there was some closure in that, but, uh, I buried him myself. I, I wouldn't let anybody throw dirt on top of him. And, uh, and as it turned out, I wound up marrying my mom too with my, with my youngest son.

Speaker 6:          02:15:38       You're, you're now, you were kind of wrapping up this book when you were writing it and, and you know, you kind of closed it out. Um, and

Speaker 6:          02:15:59       w when you closed it out, you, you said this at the end of the book, I guess part of being a father is learning how to eat a certain amount of shit. You do it for your kids because they need you. You just throw a little on a little salt and pepper and maybe some Tabasco and smile cause you gotta be there for them. One thing my father said was, I've got all these years of experience, experiences that I don't know what to do with. And that's Kinda how I feel with my boys. How do I come in for a graceful landing after so much fucking turbulence in my life? Hopefully I can guide them better than I was guided or at least maybe they will learn from my mistakes. God knows I've made enough for everybody.

Speaker 6:          02:16:40       And if I remember correctly, you were, that was the kind of the end of the book and then you were moving on and then, and then 2012 comes along and there's like a hardcore fest, you know, they're proud of bring it back. Like, oh, I don't know if it's like a reunion fest, bringing back a bunch of old bands and the chromatics w I should say a formation of the Cro mags or members of the chromatics, you can just call it the foam egg. So let's just keep it real. They were going to play a fake ass band that does my songs with one of the old members, you know, and they were going to play. Yes. And you were like, okay, um, you know, I'm gonna go check it out and you know what? I'll bring my base. Maybe we'll get onstage. I mean, you know what?

Speaker 6:          02:17:30       There was actually two members of the original group playing that night and my intention was to go and to extend my hand and say, you know what guys? I buried, I love you guys. As much as I hate you. I love you. You know, and just because I like to think that at the end of the day to people that were friends can laugh at their own foolishness. You know, I would like to think that, that people are able to look beyond their egos and forgive each other for being idiots because God knows we all are at times. So yeah, I went to that show with the hope of maybe even being invited up on stage to play a few songs with them. And um, well the rest is history. Yeah. You show up and, and here you go. You're, you're walking through the place. You go to the, you get invited up the dressing room.

Speaker 6:          02:18:25       Hey, come say hi. And then here we go back to the book. As soon as I walked in, I literally walked into the room, took two steps, the door shot, and I got punched from behind out of the corner of my eye. Could see it with some big dude with tattoos. It was like, Bam. He hit me hard. I saw a bit of a flashbulb like you see when you get hit out of nowhere and you don't expect it. And then it was a reign of fists and kicks that were coming from every direction of the room. And this was a small room. It's a dressing room and I started falling forward. I fell onto the couch and rolled onto my back and started throwing up kicks just instinctively to get people off me. I was getting jumped by at least four or five guys, probably more.

Speaker 6:          02:19:00       There was a bunch of people in the room. I think I counted seven or eight, although I couldn't even really count in all the chaos at that point. I reached into my pocket, I had a little knife, I pulled it out and it still had its sheath on. So I just tried to punch the first person that was in front of me and get them the fuck off me. Everybody started screaming. I saw the door of the dressing room open and, and I started yelling, security, security, and then I left and then I saw somebody pull the door shut and I thought to myself, fuck these dudes. Their intention is to fuck me up and they don't want no one to see it. They're trying to beat the shit out of me. And I've seen all these dudes in a pack kicking people to the point where their brains don't fucking work.

Speaker 6:          02:19:42       And I knew right then that if I didn't get the fuck out of that situation, I was not going to make it home in one piece. So I started flailing the knife as furiously as I could just to get myself the fuck out of that situation at toward the door, everybody's screaming, he's got a knife, he's got a knife and I don't even know who it was or how they ended up in my face. I guess it was when they were lunging at my arm. I bet whoever was in front of my face, I tore a big piece out of his cheek. It was obvious. It was a setup. When I saw the door pulled shut, I was fighting for my life. These guys wanted to kick the shit out of me, stomped me out, and no one would see it. There would be no whist witnesses and that would be that, but that shit was not going down.

Speaker 6:          02:20:22       I bet the one guy's face, I just tore his fucking cheat opened right below his eye. He was screaming, blood was running down his face. I bet someone's wrist as they were trying to get the knife out of my hand. I just didn't bite it. I tried to tear a piece out. That's when the bouncers broken to the room. At this point, I was on the bottom of a pile trying to stab and kick and everybody started trying to grab my hand. They're like, give me the knife, give me the knife. I'm security. I ended up getting dragged out onto the balcony getting kicked. I got one good kick in the right face and I'm surprised it did knock my teeth out. One Dude's scream, get on your stomach, get on your stomach, put your hands out in front of you. And this one big guy stepped on my back with both of his feet and another guy was looking at my face and squeezing my throat.

Speaker 6:          02:21:03       I don't know who the fuck was, who. One guy looked at me and said, motherfucker, I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I will kick you in your fucking face until you are dead, motherfucker. If you don't stop moving. I saw Pete from sick of it all and the crowd of people next to us with a freaked out look on his face. He was gesturing with his hands for me to calm down and stop resisting. He kept mouthing the words hardly chill. Harley, please stop chill Harley. That's when one guy said, put your hands out in front of you. I asked her, are you a cop? He was like, yeah. So I said, show me your badge. And at that point the boys in blue came running up the stairs. I was like, fine, I'm not moving any more cuff me. I stuck my hands out in front of me face down on the floor.

Speaker 6:          02:21:42       I still don't know that I've been stabbed. I've got 40 stitches in my leg. Thank God it was in my leg. Only the cops cuffed me. He turned me over and that's when I saw the wound in my leg. It was grotesque. The blood was bubbling out of it. The fashion tendance were literally hanging out on my leg. That's why people started saying that it was a compound fracture. The cops cuffed me, they put me on a chair, carried me down the stairs and put me in the ambulance. It wasn't until I got cleaned up in the ambulance that they realized it was a stab wound.

Speaker 6:          02:22:13       Yeah, it was a fun night. And you kind of already talked about this. I mean they basically arrest you immediately was a total melee. Yeah, and I actually won the, I got arrested. I thought we were all going to get arrested and there was this going to be like a bar fight. Everybody you get pulled in. But all these fucking guys started making statements that were basically, that I've launched into the room and started just stabbing people. So, you know, you got a room full of people saying he did it, he did it, he did it. And you got one of me saying, what the fuck happened? Fuck, he thinks is good and get walked out in cuffs and you end up on Rikers, Rikers island, for those of you who don't know from around the world is a jail in New York jail, Rikers island. And meanwhile the media, you know, it's putting out all these, uh, the version that's getting told to the media, which is that you instigated it and you were a horrible person and et Cetera, et cetera. And now you're out at Rikers island, going back to the book all night. You'd hear people screaming and talking shit. The youth offenders were in the same building as us right next door. So all night you'd hear them screaming, suck my Dick, motherfucker, I'll fuck you up. Suck my dick son, but fuck, oh fuck. All night long.

Speaker 6:          02:23:41       Riot cops came in all the all fucking night. Then as soon as the sun would start coming up and they'd finally shut up, the seagulls would start making noise. It was nonstop. Ironically, it was the best sleep I'd gotten in a while. Ever since I started going through the bullshit with my ex, my life had truly become a nightmare. I remember at one point I was looking out through my window, through the gates. It was a beautiful sunny day and I could hear the birds and a butterfly flew past my window and I was like, damn, right then and there. That butterfly represented freedom. What I wouldn't do to be free right then. I had no idea what it was going to happen. My lawyer told me I was possibly looking at two and a half years in jail.

Speaker 6:          02:24:32       Rough. Yeah, I remember that butterfly very vividly. Happy. Yo get that. You get that. I don't want to pat. It's also a prison was not in France. Yeah, it's like whatever islands. They were all there. It was a prison. I went, it was no joke, man. Prison as a no joke prisoner and you know, we always find the good in things. And you got a visitor that came to visit a woman by the name of Laura. Yes. Who's now goes by the name of Laura Lee Flanagan. And uh, she was, she had interviewed you for, for what? For what website? Uh, she had a website called New York natives.com and,

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       um, yeah, they did a lot of stories and then you know, about things happening in the city and interesting people in this and that and blogs and stuff. And she interviewed me as a, a native icon, uh, because, um, you know, you wouldn't know it from looking at her and, or by her career. I mean, she's a lawyer and she's, you know, from the upper east side, she's amazing. And, um, she used to be in the hardcore for a brief moment in her childhood, so she knew of the chrome eggs. She had seen us play. And, um, a friend of hers, a, they were doing, she did a story on c squat, a squat that I used to live in, you know, and um, it was really a good story. It was very interesting. And one of the people she spoke to around that time said, you should speak to Harley.

Speaker 3:          02:26:18       He used to live there and he'd be interesting for you know, for you to interview. And she, uh, pursued it and uh, we started talking, um, we did the interview and I started sending her some chapters of this book that I was still working on at the time. And uh, I don't remember how exactly it came about. I mean, she has a phd and she's done a lot of writing and stuff in her life and a lot of editing and stuff. And she really enjoyed the book and I needed some help in the editing. I mean, I have a seventh grade education, so there was, the book was basically one sentence

Speaker 4:          02:27:02       when I gave it to her, she gets the award for like entity and challenges. No Shit. I mean they were, it was better tonight. I was like, yeah, you edited the book. And then we, cause I was an English major too and we had a moment of like, I'm mute. I gave her a moment of mutual respect and admiration. I mean this book would it okay, it's like 300 pages. It would have been a thousand pages. And it was like I said, it was one sentence and we literally had to like, okay, we've got 10 stories about fighting now can we lose these other 20 okay, we've got 10 stories about like almost overdosing. Can we lose the other 30 okay. We've got, you know, so there was a,

Speaker 3:          02:27:49       you know, I mean it would have been a fucking endless book. I mean I took a lot of fights and a lot of drugs and a lot of rock and roll dumbness and just a lot of actually a good stories didn't make it in, you know, but I think, I think we got left with a pretty good picture of everything. You know everybody, it's actually funny because when I had the book signing, a lot of people that I went to school with and like fifth and sixth grade from my neighborhood showed up and they were like, dude, you nailed it man. You described the neighborhood. So, and

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       the funny shit is actually one of the hit men and the guys from my block was at my book signing and I actually asked him, I was like, dude, who the fuck was pig man? And he's like, oh man, that was crazy. Eddie and crazy. Eddie was a brand of PCP. We all used to smoke back then. So I'm sure that's why he got the nickname. But um, he's like, yeah man, you know, he's, he's got an auto body shop down, grandkids, blah, blah, blah, like word, you know? I like, well tell him I said, what's up? You know? But it was funny because literally like all that actually mattered more to me than the reviews of the book was when I had people who were shared, those experiences and people who grew up in the neighborhood. I mean even more so than the cro mags, parts of the books, like the people who are like, Yo, you fucking nailed it man.

Speaker 4:          02:29:09       This is exactly what the city was like. I try to tell people all the time and they don't get it. So I bought them a copy just so they can fucking see for themselves. That was when I knew that I nailed it. You know, that that was, that was, you know, there was a couple of publishers that didn't want to put it out there. Like, yeah, we can't touch this. Like, Hey, you know how, you know how your wife had to lose like 20 to fight stories and I had to do for this podcast, I got rid of their, you know, we discussed a fraction of the crazy shit that's in here. Nah, I mean we haven't even touched, I mean we could sit here and talk for the fucking till tomorrow and you know, but uh,

Speaker 6:          02:29:50       but I do, you know, I just, the book gets it across and that's why like I said, I thought I was familiar with the hardcore scene and factually, I mean I went to CBGBS, I don't know, hundreds of times when I was a kid and all shows all over the east coast. Boston. Yeah. So, but I still didn't recognize that there was this much chaos and speaking to chaos, I'm going to go back to the book here. You're sitting in jail and here we go. Because all the people talking shit and trying to frame me. The record label I'd just signed with was having second thoughts. Everything was coming to a head and now I had to prepare for a court date facing four felony counts of second degree assault and weapons charges for biting and stabbing people. If there was ever and I teach the kids.

Speaker 6:          02:30:42       If there was ever a time that I was about to lose my shit, I'd have to say it was around this time. If there was ever a time someone would relapse into drugs, alcohol or some self destructive shit. It was a time like this. I actually went out and got drunk a few nights, which I hadn't done in a long time. I was really depressed. I was really at the bottom. I could have easily spun out of control, but I said to myself, fuck that. I'm not going to let myself go and do that to myself or my kids or give in and give the satisfaction to my enemies. I'm a black belt. I have more control than that now.

Speaker 1:          02:31:19       I'm not who I once was. I'm stronger than that.

Speaker 2:          02:31:25       And then

Speaker 1:          02:31:29       the next court date I wound up getting a d an adjournment again because they didn't have a case against me. And again, it got pushed back while the DA continue to try and build it until finally in December of 2012 they contacted my lawyer and said to appear in court on Friday, December 14th when the entire case was dismissed.

Speaker 2:          02:31:52       Yeah. And Yeah, you

Speaker 1:          02:32:00       at that point, you know, you kind of get back on track. Yeah. And you're teaching Jujitsu like you said. And there's a good quote here when you're teaching Jujitsu, after you had the incident at Webster Hall and what are the parents said, you know, when into here he comes back to start teaching the kids class again after he's been all over the front page of all the papers and everybody's looking at me like, oh shit. I walked in the academy and like every half the people were super happy to see me in there. They have looked at me like so like a gunslinger just walked in. I was like, you know, fucking wild west. One of them, one of the moms, one of the moms was quoted as saying, well, at least I know my kid isn't getting taught Jujitsu by a pussy. Yeah. That was why that fucking data hands, Hanzo laugh. And yet there's still, um, there's still hard times because at this point you're, you're losing custody of your kids. Yeah. And that was, you know, that's, you know, I gotta tell you it means

Speaker 3:          02:32:59       that has been the, the biggest trial and tribulation I've dealt with. Obviously I've dealt with many, but, uh, you know, especially someone who didn't really have

Speaker 1:          02:33:14       responsible people like really

Speaker 3:          02:33:20       raising me. You know, I, it really hurts to not be there for your kids every day. You know, cause I really, I used to cherish those moments more than anything. I mean, just walking them to school in the morning and the little conversations we would have on the way to school and, you know,

Speaker 2:          02:33:39       okay.

Speaker 3:          02:33:40       Taking them to Jiu Jitsu and, you know, I really was the, uh, this, the main caretaker. I was with them all day. You know, I did everything with them, took them to the parks and museums have this. That's isn't, and to then have that taken away, it's difficult to, again, to not start fucking up, you know, especially when you're dealing with depression and all that shit again. You know, it's just like, uh, like I said, you know, we don't have someone to love and to feel that, that reciprocation and, and, uh, you don't feel needed. It's hard to not feel needed, you know. But I, uh,

Speaker 3:          02:34:31       all right. You know, I went through all the process of family court and this and that, and, uh, you know, unfortunately they don't live with me full time, but I see them a lot. And, um, you know, everybody knows who's been through a divorce and as kids, right? Fortunately, I was never married to their mother. Hallelujah. But, um, anybody who's been in that situation knows it's, it's not easy and it comes with a lot of challenges. And, uh, so now my challenge is, is to try to be involved with my kids' lives as much as I can and to, to try to give them some moral guidance and a manhood guidance from, from a distance, you know, and sadly, they didn't see, you know, me and their mother act like complete and total savages towards the end of the relationship because people, when they break up, they typically don't know how to act or behave even in front of their kids. So, but you know what, even all of this is made me a stronger and wiser person because I feel that it has again forced me to look at myself. And, uh,

Speaker 3:          02:35:42       you have choices in every situation, how you're going to react and how you, you know, what you're going to do. And now I really think about the consequences of everything. I know I can't just react explosively if somebody does or says something to me on the street because I know that that could cost me my freedom. It could cost that my kids, their father could cause my wife or husband. So, you know, even even losing my kids has been a learning experience that I hope, God forbid, they ever, you know, wind up, um, with kids in separated and this and that. But hopefully even this bad stuff can help them become better men and smarter men and hopefully better, smarter than I was, you know? And uh, I just try to, I try to believe really that, that in the end love wins, you know?

Speaker 5:          02:36:51       Okay.

Speaker 6:          02:36:52       Yeah. Um,

Speaker 5:          02:36:55       okay.

Speaker 6:          02:36:55       There were, so one more thing that you had to overcome in the book and you know, sometimes, man, I just read a big chunk of the books that I'm reviewing because it's just, uh, uh, uh, the way it's written in a way it goes and the story that it tells, I just don't really want to change it. I just want to put it out there. So I'm Kinda gonna do that right here. After all the madness in my life and the recent drama surrounding Webster Hall, my arrest, losing my kids, starting a new relationship, getting my kids back in my life and dealing with all the drama of family court. My mom was stricken with terminal cancer.

Speaker 2:          02:37:43       Okay.

Speaker 6:          02:37:44       After a major operation in what seemed like a recovery, things took a turn for the worse.

Speaker 2:          02:37:50       Okay.

Speaker 6:          02:37:51       Through it all, she remained supportive in my battle for my kids and I started spending a lot more time with her. It's fucked up when you know your mom or dad is dying.

Speaker 2:          02:38:04       Okay.

Speaker 6:          02:38:04       You go through your whole life with all the baggage and shit that they put on you and all the shit in the world and your friends put on you and then there comes a time when you realize you have to put it all down.

Speaker 2:          02:38:18       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:38:19       Then just let it all go. I was with her as much as possible during the last few months. We spent more time together than we had in years. We even left the city one day, just a month before she died to spend some time at a horse stable. She loved horses and she hadn't been around them since she was a child. She said it was the most beautiful day in her entire life, and later she spent the night and then the next three nights at my apartment, we had such a good time that she completely forgot to take her pain medication. I hope I can face death with as much dignity the way she has handled it. I've never seen a braver person in my life. She makes all the men I know look like cowards.

Speaker 2:          02:39:13       Okay.

Speaker 6:          02:39:13       Sadly, she only saw my kids twice during her last few months, but the time that they spent together was amazing and very meaningful and picked up her spirits.

Speaker 2:          02:39:23       Okay.

Speaker 6:          02:39:24       And I don't know. And I know that she took great comfort in the fact that I'm finally in a place in my life where things are coming together in a positive way.

Speaker 2:          02:39:32       Okay.

Speaker 6:          02:39:32       I just wish she could have been here with us longer.

Speaker 2:          02:39:37       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:39:38       She died Monday, June 15th, 2015

Speaker 2:          02:39:46       okay.

Speaker 6:          02:39:47       At the funeral, her ashes were carried out and placed on a table.

Speaker 2:          02:39:52       Okay.

Speaker 6:          02:39:53       They weren't a box. Not meant to be buried. A beautiful statue of a crying angel.

Speaker 2:          02:40:00       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:40:01       We all took part in reading from Bible verses. I held onto my son, Jonah, and he cried quietly. My son hardly stood behind me with my girlfriend trying to

Speaker 1:          02:40:13       keep his composure. As tears rolled down his face at the end of the service, a slight drizzle of rain started again. When everyone was done consoling each other and people started walking away. I looked at the box sitting on the table surrounded by flowers with the hole in the ground beside it.

Speaker 2:          02:40:35       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:40:36       to cemetery workers arrived with shovels and a rake and I walked back and asked if I could cover her with soil myself as I don't from my father. 13 years earlier, I explained that I didn't feel right about someone who didn't know my mother covering her with dirt.

Speaker 2:          02:40:55       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:40:56       they understood.

Speaker 2:          02:40:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:40:59       I thank them. I took the box with the angel off the table. I kissed it. My son's kissed it and I got down on my knees and put it in the ground. I wonder. The cemetery workers handed me a shovel and I started to fill the hole. My youngest son who'd been crying came over next to me. Got on his knees and started to help me fill the hole with his hands, grabbing pieces of soil and putting them in, picking out rocks so none would damage her box as we filled it.

Speaker 2:          02:41:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:41:37       And his tears stopped.

Speaker 2:          02:41:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:41:40       I put down the shovel and we both finished by hand and then I raked the soil over and we pat it down the earth with our hands and it was done. It was so sad and so beautiful. The next day was father's day.

Speaker 2:          02:42:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:42:05       When I started writing this book, I didn't know what the end was going to be or what I wanted to say besides telling the story of my life and setting the record straight. But now it's so obvious what is about closure and that that wraps up the book. Yeah. And look, no one has lived a perfect life. We've all made mistakes. We've all done things that can't be on dawn, and we've gone places that we should not have

Speaker 6:          02:43:12       gone, but we all have the opportunity to redeem ourselves. And it starts with confessing what we've done. It starts with owning it and then getting on the right path and staying on the right path and staying on that path, the correct path. It takes discipline and it takes humility and it takes courage and it's hard, but what is the other choice? What else can we do? Let the darkness completely consume us. Live for instant gratification. Wherever we can find it. Be over taken by temptation. Advice. No, do not accept that. I, I hear from a lot of people that struggle with all these things. They're caught, they're drowning.

Speaker 2:          02:44:41       Okay?

Speaker 6:          02:44:42       They're folding under the weight of pain and suffering and misery and addiction and they asked me what I think. Well, what I think Nan, what Harley proves is that you are better than that. You are better and you can try on flow over these dark forces. You can become better. You can be better for yourself and for the people around you. For all of us, hold the line, stay clean,

Speaker 2:          02:45:46       okay.

Speaker 6:          02:45:47       And never surrender. You overcame a lot of stuff, man.

Speaker 2:          02:46:09       I

Speaker 3:          02:46:10       have and I'm still trying, you know?

Speaker 8:          02:46:16       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:46:22       I guess everyone is. Yeah. This is the time in the podcast. Why we have that coherence. One of the many reasons

Speaker 8:          02:46:39       because where do we get a chance to decompress a little bit. Yes. Fully, fully. He gets to ask a couple questions. It plagued my mind a little quick. Yeah. You know, like when after the thing where'd they stop wearing

Speaker 3:          02:46:53       and my leg. Um, I mean it's, you can see when I was

Speaker 8:          02:46:58       oh yeah, yeah. Like lower lake. Yeah. Yeah. Cause you were saying the thought or they thought it was a compound fracture. Yeah. Cause you know Fisher is white. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Tagging out. So everybody thought that was bowling. It was sticking out. Yeah. That it make sense down there. But kind of by your Shin, like in your thigh, be like compound fracture that yeah. No, I didn't even know it happened until I was coughed on the floor or I'll see it. And that's so crazy. Like when you're in the moment so much. Yeah. Well you can get straight up, stab, stab with your stuff, hanging out, going to be hanging off and you'd be like, okay, what's next? Okay. Oh, is that all my cases off all day? Oh, can I help you? Here's your eyeball. Thanks. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:47:39       Uh, I mean that's why, that's why I'm so sketchy when it comes to like, as much as I, you know, I got admitted like that shit was fun. I like a good adrenaline. It's like a, a good violent confrontation. Look, good fight is fun, but it was also like life and death, you know? So it's like, you know, like I was saying, you know, like I had that one fight and California where I'm running into a mob of all these dudes. Like, you know, I was high off that shit for like a week. My adrenaline,

Speaker 8:          02:48:18       it's like, ah, I felt like I could fucking raw. Yeah. And then like a week later, I'm like, what the fuck man? Yeah. What was that shit? You know? So like

Speaker 3:          02:48:30       as much as you know. Yeah. It was fun. How often do you get to have a street fight anymore? You know, Shit. Especially at my age.

Speaker 8:          02:48:37       You guys, good time, man. But it was all the other shit, all the fucking ripple effects that came along. We're like, fuck, I may not see my kids. Fuck, I may be in jail. Fuck of the next three years. Like fucking, you know, protecting my ass for bubbles over here. Yeah. I'm like fucking, you know, those shit was like, damn man, can we forget Kate, we just all get along. Okay. We all just have a street fight, you know, and just like, can't we all just have a Steve ride get on with our Shit, you know?

Speaker 3:          02:49:05       But you know, but you know, shit

Speaker 8:          02:49:08       happens man. We going to do man. Yeah. When you put everything into perspective, the whole getting into street fights doesn't seem quite as dope. Yeah. You know, it changes when you got responsibilities. That's the thing. The responsibilities anyway. Speaking a responsibility, responsibility. We're not getting any younger. Um, so we'll talk about on at first as always. Um, so on it supplements, you know, you know, but on it, no, most people use just to know, but on oh, and the west coast, they do. I think that's how you mother fuckers,

Speaker 7:          02:49:43       you are [inaudible] need to get on it. Yo. Yo what the fuck is up with on it?

Speaker 8:          02:49:51       True. But here endure. And that's what I thought too with supplements where it's like, yeah, it takes up him until they get you big. I found that that's not necessarily the case. So the supplements that I take the we take, therefore like you got a suitcase, which I'm in him.

Speaker 7:          02:50:05       I'll get you [inaudible] been on other shit. [inaudible] this is stuff that's good. This is legal. I want you to be on the right stuff towards the light. The light is on it.

Speaker 8:          02:50:27       You know how like, like for example, the one, the ones that I take, we take now because Krill oil for inflammation and shit like that. You're exactly right. So the so on, it is like a real reputable company that, um, like, you know, you're getting, because right, you can get supplements and you're getting like they say a Krill and you're getting like fucking, you know,

Speaker 7:          02:50:53       rat Rach bladder oil or some shit, you know? And they'll be like, yeah, that's cool. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          02:51:01       The rest of it's own vitamin e Joe. Yes, exactly. Right. So this is like known to be the best. I'm going to have to get down. Actually I'll read the, you know the main guy, his like he has an extensive background in like uptake. You know how like you can get a calcium supplement but that supplement won't deliver the uptake so your body doesn't deny even breaking it down or absorbing it. Yes, exactly. So this only snow, there's a lot of different vitamins and all that shit. I, I tried to get all my vitamins through food. Yes. You know, if I can, you know. Yeah, that's optimal. So that's kind of the point there were like, yeah, when you get it with food, you know that you're going to get the best uptake for the most part. You know, if you, if you're getting your, you know, I dunno, protein from soy beans or something, you know, something, I don't get as much protein as you animals over here. I'm a vegetarian. I have been since like 82 or something like that, which I also think is one of the reasons why I managed to maintain a certain level of health and sanity despite all the drugs. I think that that actually, you know, helped me.

Speaker 7:          02:52:09       The wheat grass [inaudible] hey, hey, everyone was listening to a podcast. If you're shooting up heroin and always wear a condom when you're shooting your hair. Yes, good Lord. Well, yeah, you figure that's optimal from the food, but on it like they like Vaco. Good job

Speaker 8:          02:52:29       in knowing like the optimum way to uptake. Like the nutrients. Yeah, I found that out nice. That's like, you know, I was like, you know, that's a good one. Anyway, one of the reasons. So we do krill oil, strong bone, new one. I just started. Jack always does it for your, for your joints. So you do know I have some joint issues after a while. That's how, and yeah, the, and the crude oil helps a lot. A lot. A lot. That's the, I'd say that's the number one that I would recommend. I'd recommend a few more other things too, but just for different reasons. Like to have this one warrior Bart's buff while you're vegetarian, so nevermind. Buffalo, buffalo meat. Maybe. You know how like they make not necessarily no buffalo meats better for you? I mean, I know you know it doesn't have all the fucking hormones. I don't know if you can necessarily offer it to the God.

Speaker 7:          02:53:14       Sorry, which God you're offering it to. I mean, I'm sure there's some native American guy does a lot of the warrior bars to fear Hindu. There's enough guys to pick from and I got plenty.

Speaker 8:          02:53:31       Yeah, I think they'd be done for the shroom tech as well, which is stuff it's made from a mushroom, the mushroom name, different kinds of mushrooms

Speaker 7:          02:53:41       I was doing on the board started to sound good, but it's just to help you uptake oxygen when you do with athletics. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 8:          02:53:54       You need to, especially as you get older, your oxygen, it doesn't travel as well. I just realized there's no greater joy for echo. Then when someone's on the, on the, on the podcast as a guest that wants to know about this stuff, like when I'm training or whatever oil is it like you know your thing and I'm like doing a sales pitch to them. It seems like it. Anyway, get them a krill shirt. I asked me about the Krill oil. I'm telling you in the mornings, I told this story before, Jack heard it plenty of times in the mornings. My daughter, she's, she's like for now, but you know when she was three she come in, wake me up. The only person in the world that hasn't heard the story is Harley Fun. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:54:40       [inaudible] and me talk for three hours right there. Heck gets to talk for an hour now about story. And that was a good,

Speaker 8:          02:54:54       but she'd, she'd wake me up, jump on my back. So you know, now I've got to stand up out of bed, cold, sore from whatever with the three year old on my back and it would be stiff. I got to do the correct form to get up. Otherwise, you know, you turn your back, your knees, all that stuff after like it was just under a week. Krill oil, no factor. It's like I was already warm. That's the feeling. You want some Krill oil now. I was just going to

Speaker 4:          02:55:20       Jack. I got to give my, uh, father-in-law some props. May he rest in peace. He turned me onto the Krill.

Speaker 8:          02:55:26       Oh, all right. Let me tell you other than laws, but what's up filing laws? They've been around,

Speaker 4:          02:55:33       been around a little longer than us. Yeah. No, he turned me on and, and even though you know, I am a vegetarian, I do take the official, the Krill oil and whatnot, because you know what I mean? Look, I, I started off as a vegetarian food for whatever spiritual reasons and whatever health reasons. Now I, I believe it's best to have mainly vegetarian diet, but if my body starts saying, motherfucker, he needed some fish like you, you are like about to drop dead. If you don't get some serious protein search, like I will do what I, what my body tells me to do. I think humans are designed to be able to do vegetarian and meat. That's why we have two different kinds of teeth. You know, when we were hunter gatherers, you know you were gathering a lot more than you were hunting realistically. Cause one thing wasn't always easy with a fucking spear, you know, so yeah.

Speaker 8:          02:56:31       You know, I listen to my body a lot too and my body usually tells me each day, you know crops total pro. Well the good thing about the Krill, whether this meat however much this means, how they harvest the Krill is also yes. Do it though. It's good. They use like ecofriendly chips. He watched the video friendly shifts [inaudible] no friendly shit. Fuck it up the video. I watched the video is good. Okay. Maybe you just need to have their own podcast called the echo on it. Podcast. People need to know. You got to fucking make your own line. Eco Oil something. I don't know man. It's hot it one. I think they haven't nailed it. All right on it. I'm going to get on it. Interesting enough how your father in law turned up. My father in law turned me onto it. I didn't listen to him, by the way. I only did it when Jocko was like, yeah, I take Krill oil. So I was like, okay, I'm going to take whatever. Anyway. Anyway, [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko that's how you can get 10% off of all your stuff. Whatever you like. Well, I'm just going to ask him directly gave me the tech.

Speaker 8:          02:57:51       That's what I did in the beginning to for sure. Yeah. Also good way to support Amazon. Click through. So what all that is, you shop on Amazon, right? I guess I have how I just said you're the only person that hadn't heard like the Krill oil, so now you're the only person in the world does not getting everything they buy off of Amazon. Oh, I live in the city. I go to the store, I guess isn't different. Yeah, we want it. We go out and close the door and get it. You can walk. Yeah, you can walk everywhere. Yeah. It's not like that. Like I said, we got yards and barbecues and yards. Fuck y'all motherfuckers all miserable. No winter jazz. Mother fuckers. No snow, nothing gets study. We have a winter. Was He? You know he's from Hawaii. He takes it from California. Goes one step further.

Speaker 8:          02:58:44       My mom says that, oh yeah, in the winter it rains a lip or I don't even know if that's true reins a little. That shit that don't qualify as [inaudible] mean it feeds the plants. You know it's a fucking mind soon. I don't want to hear it. Yeah man. I hear bad things. Bad things. So Amazon, Amazon, all these things you've turned to me shopping on Amazon and this goes for everyone. Before you get to animal, you click through the website, our website, your website support. So when you bought you get a thing from Amazon saying hey, thanks for referring. You know it's pretty, that's pretty dope. They give us a little bit a little piece of that and you know what it costs the Vick. The cool thing is, cause you can set up things for, for like podcasts, that's basically give me money, give me money. But I don't really like asking people for money. This is, you don't even, it doesn't, your price doesn't go up. It's actually in my book, it's kind of a good way to stick it to the man because Amazon's got a kick a little bit down to the podcast are over here. It's kind of not because I mean you stick it to the man to [inaudible] fucked man.

Speaker 8:          03:00:14       Yeah, a little bit of confusion there. That's cool. But I mean either way, you know when you do the, I think it does benefit Amazon cause like a referral, you know, I mean, so you're saying that somebody might order something from another online retailer but instead someone says I'm going to support the podcast. Yeah, fuck that. Support the podcast. Motherfucker. Don't be a bunch of bitches. You gotta support the home team, man. Fuck that. I feel the same shit. But Amazon is actually pretty cool like that. Like they'll offer every once in a while like little things like, oh you want to donate? Like you round up. Like, let's say your thing costed like eight 89 and you're like, Hey, your gut, 11 cents to the next dollar, you want to donate that 11 cents to like something, it's like charity anyway. It's good like that. Anyway, and I support the podcast, do through the Amazon, click through, go to the Jocko podcast website, which is Jocko podcast.com and click on the support or the Amazon banner and then do your shopping.

Speaker 8:          03:01:09       And that's a good way. Some people, they'll do it and then like the little, they'll get a screenshot of it and they'll send it to me on Twitter knowing that that is cool. That is dope. It's confirmation. Yeah. And it's Kinda like, like they say, Hey, I'm supporting them and I feel, I feel that like literal direct support from their coach Charles A. Good day as your support, the podcast with a little social needs when, cause I got, a lot of times they don't, I don't see like the price or nothing. You, they'll just say, oh, it'll be a screenshot. Pretty ambiguous. It could very well not even be them. So putting the podcast necessarily call. Yeah. Just trying to tickle your did that. Maybe it works. It works out. Like when they do that makes me feel good. I feel like they care very easy. Easy.

Speaker 8:          03:01:55       Anyway. You can subscribe to the podcast, iTunes if you listen to it on iTunes, stitcher, Google, play, all these ones. Um, yeah, that helps leave a review. If you're in the mood, like what chuck was saying, or hardly seems like you don't give a review on this specific one. Oh, we have a youtube channel. If you have not subscribed to that, good. Subscribe to that. If, if you'd like the video version of this podcast, but the excerpts, you know, people have been kind of giving me crap about saint excerpts a lot too. I say excerpts. You say it a lot and you put your tone on it for you. Don't just say, I don't think he said no. You don't say, Hey, you know, we've got some excerpts that we put on it. You Go, I made a couple extra.

Speaker 8:          03:02:41       You Go, you go. Escalation voice level 12. Yes. Well I think that was your right? Was that your idea? Excerpts? Yeah. There you go. Yeah, because people don't want to watch TV. They're not going to watch it. Three hours, three hour podcast. If there's some point, oh hey Joe glue. Cool thing with Harley Flanagan. He was talking about this. They want to see Harley for three minutes. I want to send it to their body that they listen to hardcore with. They can't send them, hey, watch this three and a half hour podcast in the next, during your lunch break, you're going to send him a little clip, right? Listen to Harley Flanagan. Talk about a street fight. Yeah, yeah, exactly right. Maybe you should do a bunch of excerpts of yourself talking about on it and extra next to me. Seen excerpts. Yeah, that's not very shareable, but that was a good idea.

Speaker 8:          03:03:28       Thank you Jacqueline for that. So if you want to see excerpts of random lessons, not random, they're not random. Sorry, any mean random excerpts of lessons, individual lessons selected, selected from the podcast. Boom. That's on youtube. And also if you want one, tell echo on social media. Hey, make this time period on this podcast into an excerpt and put me on there too, because that way I can harass him too. Now we can't do to every single one. Quest. Yes. Straight to every single one. But some of them icy and I go, yeah, Echo. Come on man. The nickel are asking. I agree. Could you post the wheat grass and heroin? That'd be a fun one. I think we're gonna. I think we're going to do that one. But we'll have tee shirt

Speaker 7:          03:04:20       [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          03:04:23       cause everybody, that's another thing, they want extroverts, but people also want to have tee shirts for everything. Like anything that some person where somebody finds something funny or interesting or whatever and it's, hey, we need to make that into a teacher. And then it gets escalated to a certain point where enough people ask for it and then we break down. You should go breaks down and makes a teacher. It works too. It's like a Oh yeah, it's good. Yeah. It's so the excerpts. Good idea. Thank you. Uh, Youtube. But if you do the request, if you're requesting that the, you know what episode and what x or be sure you know which, which excerpts are already on there. Cause sometimes people are like, Hey, do this London and then it'll already be on there just saying. Yeah. Sometimes people tell me to do a book review and it's already been done.

Speaker 8:          03:05:12       Oh yeah. If you're doing a review on art of war, yeah, I get a lot of requests like that. Then I have to look up and see which one it is and then send it back to him and say, hey man, I already did it on this one. Yeah. Actually that's a good like how we're going over today. That's a good thing about how we put the, the timestamps on all the subjects. So an and that feeds into the search term. So if you, you're like, hey, some suit Jocko podcasts are devor it'll go boom to that episode 23 actually coming on top of this book, there's a book out about HR right now from the bad brains. And the reason I'm thinking of this is because one of my buddies who's in to the podcast who was a hardcore kid growing up, and his name is Nahko, but he's a, he's a cop in La and he was a cop in New York. And so it's, I'm just thinking about that. Here's a kid that grew up listening to the cro mags, who's been like saying, get hardly or you got to get her, he's a cop. He's a bad ass cop and his and his girl was a cop too. Dang. They're getting, after I got to phrase that cops, man, don't hate them all.

Speaker 8:          03:06:16       You know people, they'll be like, hey, no, I don't eat carbs. I have friends that are cops.

Speaker 7:          03:06:22       Some of my best friends are black. I got a cough Capo, my phone.

Speaker 8:          03:06:37       Fuck No. Oh good. I'm also, hey, Jocko has a store. It's called Jocko store. These shirts, stucco. We're man, I need to get one of these discipline equals freedom. The fucking shirts. You know, I wrote a song recently that I named discipline equals freedom and just I got

Speaker 4:          03:06:56       to fucking say, because you know I don't give a fuck, I'm going to say it and that's that. Yo, when I found out that Jocko was in the hardcore and when I found out that he was into my band, the Cro Mags, I was, I was very proud and all and uh, and I asked this motherfucker, you give a thought about singing in her heart

Speaker 7:          03:07:19       and fucking reaction I got out of this month

Speaker 4:          03:07:22       fucker. If my computer screen could like just turn into like a fucking screaming look. Motherfucking the, the, the the response. Anyway, I am very proud to say that a w w we are going to be playing besides doing this European tour. I'm going away in a week playing all over the place. Then we'll come back and in June I'm going to be playing in La and we have invited Jocko to come and make a special guest appearance when we play it, the fury fest in La. And so for all you motherfuckers out there who want to see me playing with one of the baddest motherfuckers walking this fucking earth certified by the u s fucking government, then you, you were going to see some fucking Badass shit because I'll tell you I have not gotten, I haven't been able to just play the bass and not be like chained to the microphone in a really long time. And that was one of the things that was intense about the cro mags back in the old days was that me and the singer both used to go fucking ape shit when we played. And it's funny cause you know I was thinking for the longest time man, if I could get a singer what I get and I'm like, you know shit, I'm like, I'm like, you know Henry Rollins in his prime was fucking bad ass. You know Phil Anselmo in his prime was a fucking bad ass jock.

Speaker 7:          03:08:45       So we'll see what happens if [inaudible] want to see some shit. You know, I used to have a fake seal thing in my band. Now I get a real one. We'll see what happens if a, if a Mike ends up in my hands, I may have to slap them with a mic and see what happens.

Speaker 4:          03:09:02       Hey, there you go. Yeah, you guys can sing the or with those shirts on [inaudible] story. That's where you get them. I got you. Whatever shirt you need. Oh yeah, for sure. But if you're in the mood to support the podcast, purchase a shirt or whatever, we have other stuff on there. Jocko. Story, outcome. Got Those mugs you made. Yeah, those are some good monks. So I shouldn't have even said this. He's been amped about these brew coffee mugs we got or what did he called? Travel mugs. Travel mugs. Tumblers. I've heard. Yeah. All right. Look, I won't go that deep into it this time. Next time I'm going deep extra deep. This time I'll go. Just kind of deep. This is straight up the best cup of it, right? What does it look? It look like his head,

Speaker 7:          03:09:46       like a handle on it. Actually we kept a little bit,

Speaker 8:          03:09:54       you know, it's just black on black. It's like black matte and then the design, you know, it looks like this on one side, then it's shiny black anyway, it looks super dope, but 30 ounces so big enough but small enough to fit in your cup holder. Boom. I, I'd been drinking some mother fucking coffee. So, so here's the thing about the coffee, it's, it's those ones that are like, I dunno how they make them, you know, the insight and the, I dunno, they're stainless steel, BPA free, all this, you know, good stuff. I don't know what all of that means, but it's, I know it's dope. It's Krill involved. Yeah, it's somewhere down. The line is involved, but it keeps it like your car. If you like your coffee hot, it'll keep it hot for like eight hours or something like that. I don't know if it keeps it the same temperature for eight hours.

Speaker 8:          03:10:43       It might, I don't know. I've never had hot, I'm a cold coffee guy. All right, well here's the good news about that Bro. But you put quit. How's this? I put ice water in it and I was drinking it a drink. Like almost all of it. There was still a little bit in the bottom and I forgot about it. Went to sleep the next day I was cleaning up. I was like, oh my cup from last night. Boom, ice still in there. You know how usually in a regular cup it's like water. It'll keep it cold for 24 hours. Boom. Not losing any coldness. Anyway, I want to go way deeper next time, but this is straight, you know, special podcast for you to talk about that. That Cup or bowl out group covered. One episode will be the cop. The other episode will be the oil oil.

Speaker 8:          03:11:25       Every single day. I'll go deeper with the oil bro. I'll go deeper with the Krill oil right now if we have, I know it all, but anyway, essentially what it is anyway, but yeah, but yeah, chocolate star, this some cool stuff on their travel mugs are out. Those are good. There's some bumper stickers, some women's stuff on there, some patches, some rash guards, one new rash guard, and it's not, it'll be out, but nonetheless, I'm not going to promise anything quite yet, but new rash guards going to be out. Hoodies are on there. There's some good stuff. Hey, just take a look if you like what's on there. You want to support in that way. Get something also psychological warfare. Okay. All right. Hardly might not know about psychological war for so many. Explain it. Go deep. None. Not that deep. So basically it's an album. We're three hours and 18 minutes into this quick.

Speaker 8:          03:12:16       All right. It's an album echo. Don't care. Don't care. Don't care if the hours and keep listening. No, I'm just saying this part is kind of important too. You know what I mean? People are out there getting after it, waking up early. Some people, some of us sticking to the program, sticking to the Diet, sticking to the workouts, right? Every once in a while you wake up or you don't feel like waking up early that day or you don't feel like working out that day, you're kind of tired. You had a hard day, whatever. So when it's time to it, when it's go time, you're like, Hey, maybe I'll skip today. You know when you sleeping on the program, I know that feeling where you skip your wheat grass.

Speaker 8:          03:12:58       Exactly right. So Bam, get this album called psychological warfare to Jocko. It's not, it's not music. It's just tracks with Jocko telling you how to overcome those weak moments in your program. Oh boy. But it's him telling when I, when I am having a weak moment, the last thing I want to fucking hear, telling me to get after it right now I got to do that. Fuck, it's four o'clock. Can we fuck another four hours? Fuck me. You know, I like sleep. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with you guys, but whatever. It's all good. Yeah. Hey Man, I'm sure I like dreams. No, actually I don't. Sleep is the enemy. It's like a, it's like the last hallucinogenic. I can take [inaudible] dream. My brain goes bananas. Love it. Okay, I get it. But it goes for the workup stuff too though. Not just asleep so you can skip the sleep ones. So you go, but like, like the workout went until tell you don't skip the word anyway. It's a good, very helpful, a hundred percent chance of success.

Speaker 1:          03:14:18       But Dolan, good psychological warfare. And uh, also by the way, when you click through Amazon, you can click through and you can buy this book right here. The book is called hardcore life of my own. It is written by Harley Flanagan and we'll have it up on the website. But let me rephrase that. It's on the website or are we waiting to be purchased? And there you go pick it up on Amazon. You can also get some Jocko white tea. I hear now there's some things in the book that Harley does not recommend. He, he, he's tried them, but he does not recommend some of those things that he clearly states in the book. He literally says, I do not recommend. For instance, I do not recommend angel dust. I do not recommend heroin. I do not. So there's a lot of things he doesn't recommend.

Speaker 1:          03:15:12       Now here's something that I will strongly recommend as Jocko white tea. It's gonna get you a lot better results than anything. Any of the supplements that that Harley's taken in this book. You go with Jocko white tea instead, you're going to have a much better trip. I'm going to tell you that right now. Also, we talked a lot about Jujitsu today and we talk about Jujitsu a lot. You know, Jujitsu is a big, you know, Jujitsu is a powerful thing and there's a book that's out right now and it's geared, it's written kind of written for kids. It's called way of the warrior kid. It's available. Everyone that's bought it already. Thank you. I appreciate the support. Thanks for spreading the word. Thanks for letting kids get a little insight into life. And I'll tell you, there's something about this book that is, when I wrote it, the the debt, the father, the book is about a kid who's, you know, fifth grade going through life.

Speaker 1:          03:16:15       The father in the book doesn't have a role. Now you might think I'm a bad person for not giving the father the role, but you know, they all, he says that there's one line about the father and the book, He says, my dad's gone a lot with work and stuff. It's that ambiguous. And, and there's a couple reasons why I did that. And the number one reason is because not everyone, not every kid has got a dad. I mean, what you're saying is actually very real. Yeah. You know, and a lot of kids have to just deal with, uh, yeah, my father is not around much. Yeah. You know, and, and that's why I did it. And, and there's another subtle reason and you know, without going into too much crazy detail, the lead character in the book, his name is mark, and he's actually named after Mark Lee, who was one of my guys, were just an incredible, incredible person, incredible warrior.

Speaker 1:          03:17:14       And he was killed in Iraq and you know, he was, he, he didn't have a dad. His mom raised him and you know, so it was my way of saying, look, you know, not everyone has a dad. And, and in the book, he's got a strong uncle that comes in and helps him. But at the end of the book is uncle points out to them and he says, who's going to help me now? And his uncle says to him, look, you don't need to, you know what the right things to do are. You know how to stay on the right path. You don't need someone to hold your hand all the time. You can make this happen for yourself. And that's the message, you know, that I'm trying to get across to kids that might not have a dad. They might not have an uncle, they might not have a mom.

Speaker 1:          03:17:56       But you can find out what the right path is. You can get on it, you can stay on it. And that's, that's why I wrote the book that way. And, and you know, it's, it's interesting cause I've gotten asked many times over the years, you know, about what do you think about fatherhood and, and the important roles that fathers play. And again, you know, I go back to, for instance, Mark Lee's a great example of a kid that was raised and have a dad and his mom's a strong woman in a and an incredible person and she raised a warrior. So that's why I did that in that book. And you know, another thing that I did in that book is, you know, Jujitsu plays a prominent role, but you could replace that with wrestling, with boxing, with, with Moitai. But jujitsu was really a big part of it.

Speaker 1:          03:18:34       But so is studying, you know, um, learning, learning how to learn and having, and, and as a kid, seeing what the opportunity is in being educated because a lot of kids, myself included, when you're going to school, when you're 10 years old or 15 years old, you don't care. You just don't care. And it's, I want, I want kids to realize that it's beneficial to get stronger, faster, smarter and better. So that's a way of the war. Your kid get it and get it for your local library too because they need it. Cause there's some kid that will grab that book in the library and it'll get them on the right path. Also, discipline equals freedom field manual. You can find it by itself in the get after its section of any bookstore or online book retailer. If you look in the get after at section, this is a big empty shelf. There's a one book there, it's called discipline equals freedom field manual. We had start petitioning now to make that happen at Amazon. They just need like when you drop down business lifestyle, health and fitness, get out, boom. There's that one book they'd better get in the game and

Speaker 1:          03:19:45       also there's extreme ownership. The book that kind of started all of this stuff by the way. Thanks. Appreciate it. It's about leadership and it's about combat and it's about taking fucking responsibility and it's about taking responsibility. Absolutely. That's fucking huge. Yeah, that's huge. That's something that I think is one of the hardest things for most people to do. And you know, I actually highlighted that a bunch of times in your book where you're kind of explaining things that I guess you would say maybe resulted in something happening bad in your life and you'd say, Hey, this happened and this happened and this happened. And every time you went laid that out, at the end of it you'd say, but it's my fault and I should have done, I, I made this happen to myself. So it's pretty, uh, and, and you wrote this book before we probably writing this to say, you know, you were writing this book, the same tower is right in that book when I was basically fucking trying to kill myself with drugs and everything else is when I started it.

Speaker 1:          03:20:42       And even in that state, you always say, you know, it's my fault. I should've, you know, hey my, my dad wasn't around. Make a habit out of looking for other people to blame. I mean, it's, it's important to identify the roots of the problem and so on. And what made you the way you are so you can fix them. Exactly. Exactly. And a big, a big part of being a man is accepting responsibility for your fuck ups. And I thought that was awesome. You know, and again, you know, um, when you were talking about what you learned from your dad not being around and then how you apply that to help other kids that are in that situation, teaching them to Jitsu and taking care of him and be building relationships the best you can with your kids and with other kids that are around. Man, that's, that's exactly what you're talking about. So that's extreme ownership

Speaker 1:          03:21:38       and also don't hoard the knowledge. You might think, hey, I'm going to get extreme ownership for myself. I'm going to read at night and then I'm going to become a good leader and I'm going to do better at work. Don't do that. That's the wrong move. What you want to do. You want to actually distribute it to your team. Yeah. And that way they all get on board and now the whole team starts kicking ass. That's what you want to do. Up and down the chain of command. Then if you need more than that, you can hire our leadership and management consultant company. Echelon fun. We are the premier leadership consulting company in the entire world, so we're the ones that teach the methods and the techniques and the tactics and procedures from extreme ownership proven in combat.

Speaker 2:          03:27:42       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:27:43       And it's not an easy path. It'll be a fight. It will be a fight that demands focus and work and tenacity and of course discipline.
