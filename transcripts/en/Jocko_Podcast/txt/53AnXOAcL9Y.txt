Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number six with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Time to get back to the books. Last time I read some letters and today we're going back to the books and actually this one is kind of hard for us or it's a stretch to call this a book today we're, I've given some pretty, um, you know, the last hundred yards is a very rare piece of piece of literature, if you could even call it that. Uh, same with battle leadership. That's pretty rare now that will be fun. And found on the Internet about face was a pretty popular book. Uh, but this one tonight we're going with something that many people have heard of or at a minimum you've heard of Napoleon, right? Sure. Terry leader. But what's interesting about this and what's almost makes it cheating from my perspective for me is that these are maxims.

Speaker 1:          00:01:08       These are already parsed down and put into a format that's very easy to understand. You know, he, the work has already been done. Uh, and, and I'll tell you, it is hard for me to find books or pieces of information to do this with. And a part of the reason is it takes a, it takes, I'm looking for something very specific, right? And it's not, you know, there's, so there's a lot of, there's tons of great books about war and they are about war there about what happened and how the war happened and how, what, what tactics were used and at what unit moved where and how many people they killed and how many maneuvers they did. And so that's very interesting. And there's definitely lessons to be learned from that in there. There is knowledge and that there's knowledge inside of tactics and you'll have the most common one is like if you talk about the flank, which is the most common tactic is you know, if, if, if you're assaulting a target, you go straight on and that's, that's a frontal assault.

Speaker 1:          00:02:22       But then what you want to do is you want to swing around the outside and hit him from where they're not protecting themselves. So that's a tactic that can be applied to anything. It can be applied to a debate, it can be applied to Jujitsu, it can be proud to business situations where you know you want to hit your competition where they aren't expecting it. So that's a flank. So you, so there is knowledge to be gained from tactics for sure. But what I am always more interested in is the leadership and the the human psychology, you know, and that's why I love battle battle leadership because that first chapters, battlefield psychology, um, and this is pre, you know, this is world war one. You know, there was no kind of Fufu new age, hey feelings and what are, people know the, all that stuff didn't exist.

Speaker 1:          00:03:14       And here's this guy talking about battlefield psychology and, but, but that's what I'm always interested in. That's what I want to explore. That's what I want to learn about. That's what I want to compare my experiences too because, and I've said this before, leadership is the most challenging of all endeavors. And, and leading these human beings with all these variables is the most challenging and therefore the most rewarding. So while the tactics are important and you and you can gain from them, it's, it's how the people react, what they do, where they go. Those are the things that, that stand the test of time. And that's always what I'm looking for. Um, so these kind of things are that are the things that allow you as a leader of other people to look at those examples and learn from them and gain from them. And there will be little changes and little adjustments and you can see that there's changes over time.

Speaker 1:          00:04:23       But the basic principles, no matter when you, you can always learn from them, you know? And, and it's the same thing with the tactics. Like for instance, there was, you know, when we were fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan then I did not fight in Afghanistan, but one of my good buddies that fought with me in Iraq, and you know, we brought back a lot of tactics and learned a lot of lessons and he said after he went to Afghanistan and he said, that's the same thing. And people would say, it's not that, it's totally, it's a totally different war. And He, so he fought in both and he says, yeah, I'm in Iraq where we weren't Ramada. He goes in Ramadi and in Iraq it's streets and buildings and you know, you get the elevated positions on the buildings and then you've got control over the streets and he goes in and Afghanistan, it's valleys and hills and you know, your kid, the elevated position on the hills and, and it's pretty much the, you know, the same thing.

Speaker 1:          00:05:20       Are there differences? Absolutely. You know, but I'm saying the basic principles that he learned, he was able to apply. Um, and again, not that I don't always keep an open mind that things can change and things unexpected things will happen, but that's sort of where, you know what I'm always looking for. So that's why there's a lot of war books that I love to read and read, but I don't take away the same types of lessons that I want to talk to people about or that I think people want to talk to about. It'd be a different program. It would be a different program and maybe we should do a program that's, that's aimed at, you know, military people that are, that are concerned about tactics because that is definitely something that I, that I kind of worship that kicks you. I love tactics. I love talking about tactics.

Speaker 1:          00:06:15       Um, but, but further for normal people and, and for military leaders, learning about how people react is to me kind of what's important and what I like to explore. Right? Man. So interesting on a couple of things about Napoleon. Everyone, everyone knows, you know, something about Napoleon, a couple of cool facts about them. And this is going into this book here, which, which the book is actually called roots of strategy and it's got a bunch of different bunch of different sections to it and it's different leaders, different historical leaders throughout time. And in this section on Napoleon Napoleon going into the book here, Napoleon fought more battles than Alexander, Hannibal and Caesar combined. He is beyond any doubt the greatest of European soldiers. So pretty good lead in, we were talking about a guy with some knowledge. He astounded his opponents by the crushing rapidity of his battles.

Speaker 1:          00:07:21       He marched against the enemy and his plan of battle was a part of his plan of March. So he's a guy that used mobility and used the quickness in that pace to dictate how the battles were going to go. His tactical system or scheme of battle was based on a holding attack against the enemy's front to keep them occupied. A wide envelopment or turning movement on the enemy's rear with a small force to spread this main confusion in the defenders ranks and then the decisive blow. So that's what we just talked about and he was sort of a master of the flank, Hey, I'm going to do a good assault. You're going to be paying attention to that. And then from the side or the rear or somewhere that you're not expecting, you're getting submitted. And that's what he did. Napoleon was the first great strategist of the Western world.

Speaker 1:          00:08:15       His battles where the result of his strategical movements and we're careful, carefully calculated, very, I would say that anyone that associate, anyone that thinks of Napoleon thinks of him as a strategist and a great strategist. Now this collection of his maxims was published in Paris in 1827 and almost immediately was translated into German, English, Spanish and Italian. Stonewall Jackson carried these maxims in his hammer sack throughout his campaign. This little volume states, Colonel Henderson, who is Jackson's biography, contains a fairly complete exposition in Napoleon's own, uh, Napoleon's own words of the grand principles of war. And then the person that actually compiled the maxims. And this is actually, this is a statement that is very similar to what I started off talking about. You know, what I like to learn about the art of war is susceptible of being considered under two titles. The one which rests entirely on the knowledge and genius of the commander.

Speaker 1:          00:09:36       The other on matters of detail. Now hear, they're going to break that down a little bit further. The first is the same for all time, for all peoples, whatever arms with which they fight. From this, it follows that the same principles have directed the great captains of all centuries. So that's what I like to read about those, those same principles that have directed the great captains of all centuries, those basic principles. And a lot of those have to do with human nature. And then, and then it goes on to say that the matters of detail and what he's talking about matters details he's talking about tactics on the contrary are subject to the influence of time to the spirit of the people and the character of armor. And so, you know, that's when you change from having bow and arrows to rifles, to machine guns, to bombs, to whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:10:30       And so there, there are drastic changes in those tactics. And that's why while they interest me, and I always like to find a common thread in tactics and say, oh, it's the same thing that we do. You know, that they didn't World War One, we do that now, or whatever. You know, you all, I'm always looking to find that thread, but it's sometimes it can be hard to find and sometimes it doesn't exist to any great degree. Whereas the way people act and the way human beings respond to combat situations, it doesn't change as much. Yeah. You would think if you go deep enough or fundamental enough that it's not surprising that it won't change because dealing with people in their needs and like almost on a biological level psychologically, a lot of times biologically preservation of life plays a big part.

Speaker 1:          00:11:28       So yet technology can advance. Even social stuff can advance, but that fund, those fundamental needs typically stay the same. Him Can you, right. But if you think about this, and we talked about this last time, and like with a World War One, you know these basic needs for survival, these men, but just just threw them out the window. I mean it's just absolutely crazy. They disregarded that drive and just went over the top into hell. An intermission. Gunfires does that kind of go along the lines with something that is still here in a big way where they kind of put their own personal needs, whether they, you know, their, their, their need to survive personally, they put the need for their mission or their honor to survive. They put that in front of their need to survive personally. [inaudible] that's Kinda, doesn't that kind of translate even now?

Speaker 1:          00:12:23       That's how like, yes, yes. I mean I guess if we say that that's a, that that's a normal human trait, which I don't know if it is or not that I think it's something that gets learned. I don't think it's a inherent normal, normal trade. Unless you say, look, people have an inherent trait to make their tribe, their family survived and maybe that's it. Yeah, that's what I was going to say. That's exactly what I was going to say. So military culture, especially when you, when you deal with the elite, were doing a good job to put it lightly. Doing a good job is very important. You would think that that culture cultivates that need to put the mission in front of my own personal stuff still in so deep into that, that individual that it does most of the time Trump their need. Yeah, you're right.

Speaker 1:          00:13:15       And that thread actually, we can go through all, all of history and find a thread of, of groups of people that sacrificed and put there the mission or the, the group out of themselves, right? Yes, yes. I mean look at Thermopylae with the, the 300 Spartans. I mean, that's our classic example. And even the fought and died for their country. Yeah. And even people who aren't in the military, we understand that that's how elite soldiers are. You know, we understand that. Oh yeah, they, they, that's an elite soldier. One Who will put his life on the line for the mission for the country. That we all understand that. And you use the term elite, but I will not use the term elite because I've seen every soldier who wouldn't be considered elite. Right. I've seen them. All right. Do that marines do that and US Army soldiers and, and you know, the, the untrained reservists that doesn't really hasn't been through the kind of training that we have at all, but they will have that.

Speaker 1:          00:14:23       So it has nothing to do really with, which actually proves your point even more is that it doesn't even have to do with your level of training or your so called being elite. It has to do with your dedication to the mission and the people that are with you. So, but yeah, I guess a better than better than a better word than elite would be, I guess just like a dedicated soldier. Just a soldier in general. Yes. So back to the book here. A plan. Okay. Now this is, now we're getting into the maxims and I'm not, I obviously didn't do all of it, but I picked out the ones that I kind of fought, have the most, uh, talk about human nature. But at the same time also talk about from a leadership perspective, planning execution. If they are important and they are universal, then I, I, I put them in here.

Speaker 1:          00:15:08       And this is kind of one of them that I just talked about with planning. A plan of campaign should anticipate everything which the enemy can do and contain within itself. The means of forwarding him plans of campaign may be infinitely modified according to the circumstances. This is exactly what we heard on battle leadership from von Shell is that, so he just said, you know, the plan should anticipate everything. But then he goes on to say, plans of campaign may be infinitely modified according to the circumstances, the genius of the commander, the quality of the troops, and it's apostrophe of the theater of war. So this is again a common thread that we hear all the time. And that is you got to have adaptability and you've gotta be, and one of the biggest hindrances to adaptability is ego is when you saying, Oh, you know what? My plan is awesome. My plan is my plan is the best and I'm just going to ride my plan into the ground and take everyone down with me because I don't have the humility to admit that my plan went wrong. To admit that the enemy did something I didn't expect to, to admit that I have shortfalls with my troops or whatever the case may be and say, you know what, I need to adapt. I'm going to do it now.

Speaker 2:          00:16:27       Next one.

Speaker 1:          00:16:30       All war should be systematic for every war, should have an aim and be conducted in conformity with the principles and rules of the art war should be undertaken with forces corresponding to the magnitude of the obstacles that are to be anticipated. Now what caught me about that one was recently I got asked a bunch of questions about the situation in Iraq and Syria and one of the things people want to throw out there because it's a,

Speaker 2:          00:17:05       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:17:05       it's a catchy,

Speaker 2:          00:17:07       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:17:08       buzz word or group of buzzwords and that's, you know, boots on the ground and you know, I kept getting asked, well how many boots on the ground do we need? How many troops do we need to put on the ground? And my answer was the same every time, which is we put as many troops on the ground as it takes to win and to win decisively. And without question, that's how you go to war.

Speaker 2:          00:17:37       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:17:38       Now, this is another little maxim which I really like at the commencement of a campaign. The question whether advance or not requires careful deliberation. So before you go into war, you carefully deliberate, and this is something that I've been talking about lately. When people think that because I'm a soldier, because I'm a warrior, that I want to go to war and I want all my friends go to the war, which is just a ridiculous statement. If there's anybody that understands the impact of war, it's guys that have been to war. So this careful deliberation before you commence a campaign is exactly what should be done. And then it goes on to say, but when you have once undertaken the offensive, it should be maintained to the last extremity,

Speaker 1:          00:18:41       right? That's commitment. That is commitment. Now I will say this even on that, and that's a beautiful thing you should maintained to the last extremity. That's an extreme statement and I would tell you that you got to balance that and you want to maintain that. But what I just said is that, you know, if your plan isn't working, you got to put your ego in check and figuring out a new plan. So yeah, you want to maintain it to the last extremity, but just short of elastics remedy is okay. Do an ego check and make sure you've got a good plan going. A retreat, however skillful the maneuvers may be, will always produce an injurious moral effect on the army. Since by losing chances of success yourself, you throw them into the hands of the enemy. Besides retreats cost far more both in men and material than the most of bloody engagements with this difference that in battle, the enemy loses nearly much as you while on a retreat, the loss is all on your side. Again, a common thread that we talk about with von Schell, with Hackworth in that is being on the offensive is good. Being on the offensive is always better than being on the defensive.

Speaker 1:          00:20:08       This is a another. Um, I hope, I don't know what I'm saying this for every one of these maxims. But these are you. You know, and it's not surprising that you do say this before each one of these maximums, you go, wow, this is an impactful, and this is an important, I've heard this before, this is another way of reinstate or restating the same topic that we say all the time. A general should say to himself many times a day, if the hostile army were to make is make its appearance in front on my right or on my left, what should I do?

Speaker 2:          00:20:43       Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:20:44       And if he is embarrassed, his arrangements are bad, there is something wrong, he must rectify his mistake. So this is the humility of constantly asking yourself, okay, if I got hit from the flank right now, what would I do? How would I handle it? Am I ready for that? If I'm not ready for it, how do I make that change? So constantly assessing yourself, seeing where you're at, seeing how you're doing. That's a common thread, not just for war, but for being a man and being a human. Being a woman, being a, being a person that's trying to be successful. Are you looking at looking around and you know, things are, I'm, I'm always most nervous when things are going well. When things are going well, I'm always thinking, okay, what wince? When is the bad thing going to come and hit me? Right. You know, how do I prepare for that?

Speaker 1:          00:21:35       How do I watch out for it? How do I flank that thing before it happens to, a lot of times people will get in, they'll in a way revel in the success. Right. And they'll get used to it. It'll be good to them. They'll get used to it and then, yeah, when something does go bad or just different, even a lot of dining decided, yeah, they're just still into that success and immersing themselves in, in that success then yeah, they didn't know what to do. I was a wee, my first deployment to Iraq, we were doing assaults in capturing bad guys and we got a guy and then we went and got another guy. Right. Right on. Right on top of them. We interrogated that guy. We wouldn't go. We broke down some cell and my commanding officer at the time, he came to me, he said, Hey Jocko, those, you know, I think it was four missions in a row within 24 hour period.

Speaker 1:          00:22:27       And he said, hey, those operations that, that was awesome, awesome work, be able to tell your platoon. They did a great job getting the information, going back out there, a quick planning cycle. It was just fantastic. You know, those are very admirable. And I just looked at him, I said, give us 24 hours and we'll screw it up. And I just, you don't want to set expectations. That's how, that's how, that's to avoid what you were talking about. To avoid. Be like, that's right. You know, I said, no. Hey, you know what sir? Give us 24 hours and we'll screw it up. Right. Do you ever fear like in that were in that particular case that um, he could look at edit as, Dang, are you being negative or could, obviously you're not, given what you're saying, you're not being negative, you're checking yourself the whole time.

Speaker 1:          00:23:13       But do you fear that that either he didn't, either your commanding officer or anyone would take that as, Dang, this guy's a pessimist or something like that? No, I had a great relationship with my, with all my commanding his officers, you know, why are we say that's my responsibility is to have a great relationship with these guys. And so he knew that I was just being humble and making sure that we're getting cocky even though he was trying to fire me up and you know, he's probably be trying to do that because everyone was kind of burned out. I mean from doing, staying awake for a long period of time and doing a bunch of hops and he was just trying to, you know, give some compliments and I just said, hey sir, no, let's not, let's not get crazy here. Yeah. Long deployment ahead of us still. So you gotta be careful of that.

Speaker 2:          00:23:58       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:24:01       To operate upon lines remote from each other and without communications between them is a fault, which ordinarily occasions a second the detached column has orders only for the first day. It's operations for the second day may depend on what has happened to the main body. Thus according to circumstances, the column wastes time and waiting for orders or an acts randomly.

Speaker 1:          00:24:30       So what that means is you've got multiple elements out there and you've got the main element and whoever breaks off from that main element, they might know what to do the first day, but what do they do the second day? And this is just going into classic decentralized command because in reality today, in today's world, this rarely happens where we lose total communications. And in the business world, I mean I'm a text away, you can literally talk to me at instantaneously. But there there's, there's times in combat and in the business world and in life where instantaneously isn't fast enough. You know, eat is not fast enough. When we talked about this with decentralized command, if, if you know, you get ambushed and you don't know what you're supposed to do as a commander, when you get ambushed, you don't have a plan, you don't have an overall strategy, then what are you going to call back to higher headquarters and saying, Hey, Jocko were getting ambushed right now.

Speaker 1:          00:25:27       What do you want me to do? No, I've, I've you, you gotta be out there in the field with the, with the commander's intent that you know what, what you're supposed to do and you know that if you could ambush, here's what you're going to, you're going to break contact. Are you going to flank the enemy or whatever the case may be. But you're gonna know what to do in a, in a business environment, it's the same thing. There's times where instant communication isn't fast enough. You know, I actually see this when we work with like sales people and you know, there'll be some hierarchy of, of adjusting product pricing and you know, a client will come in or a customer will come in and if that person, if that frontline salesperson doesn't have the ability to make up a pricing decision on the spot.

Speaker 1:          00:26:15       And so, you know what sir, I see you, you know, you've, you've shopped us around and this is the deal you've got over there. I can do the here, I can take care of you. We can beat that price. If he can't do that, he's gonna loose. You know, if he goes, let me check with my manager, he could hang onto them, but there's a chance he's going to lose them. So sometimes instantaneous isn't fast enough, you know, it's gotta be, it's gotta be quicker. It's got to be able to happen with no communications. And that's, that's what this is referring to it all. It all been to be adopted as a principle that the columns of an army should always be kept United so that when the enemy cannot thrust themselves between them,

Speaker 1:          00:26:57       this is something that I always preached to my seal leadership. And that is that separating your forces, and sometimes you do have to do it and it's, and it's a completely acceptable tactic, but is always better. To be unified is always better, to be unified. It's always better to be close enough that you could, in fact, you can be separate, but you don't usually always need to be close enough to each other to support each other. So if you know you shouldn't be getting your, you and your element shouldn't be getting any further away from me and my element, then we could be able to support you. So what's the range of my guns? What's the accurate range of my guns? You know, if I can shoot three or 400, 500 meters, you know, if you have eight guys and I have eight guys and now we're getting further than that apart, that means I really can't support you. So now we're alone and that's not how you want to be. So again, there's times where people have to take calculated risks, but we always would say, you know, keep that, um,

Speaker 2:          00:27:58       keep

Speaker 1:          00:28:00       together. Stay together as much as you can. And, and again, this is, uh, I'm, I'm talking tactics now. This is like for people that are in the military that are listening to this podcast, this is something to keep in the back of your mind. Stay where you can cover and move. Stay where you can mutually support one another.

Speaker 1:          00:28:21       They should move to Ho up when for any reason this maximum is departed from the detached core should be independent in their operations. They should move towards a fixed point at which they are you to unite. They should march without hesitation and without new orders and should be exposed as little as possible to the danger of being attacked separately. This to me, goes into contingencies where if we do get separated, you've got to know, okay, if I get separated and it's been an hour, I'll go into this fixed point and we're going to make it happen. Yeah, that's something you're at the mall, he's going to say when you got a family, this is something you actually have to legit come up with. Okay. If we get separated, here's what a meeting, here's what time. And by the way, if we don't make that muster for whatever reason, the next one will be here. And so you've gotta have a little contingency planning with the FAM, make sure it's all good. What does muster mean? A muster means bring everyone together and counts how many people you have. I'm going to say that next time. Yeah. Say mastery is at so and so.

Speaker 2:          00:29:22       Next one.

Speaker 1:          00:29:25       Uh, well-established maximum war is not to do anything with your enemy wishes and for the single reason that he does. So wish. Okay. That is pretty self explanatory. Don't do anything that your enemy wants you to do. You should therefore avoid a field of battle, which he is, reckoned, ordered and studied.

Speaker 2:          00:29:47       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:29:48       You should still, you should be still more careful to avoid one, which he has fortified and where he has entrenched himself.

Speaker 1:          00:29:58       A corollary of this principle is never to attack in front a position which admits of being turned. So one of the, one of the biggest pieces that I take away from this, and this is you, you should still be more careful to avoid one, which he has fortified and where he has entrenched himself. I used to give my guys a warnings about this, about these fixed positions that are entrenched and I wasn't talking about combat. You don't, I was talking about, I was talking about debates, I was talking about debates because you w w there's, there's guys in the seal teams that would lure you into some kind of a debate about let's say the strategy that the seal teams were using it that the strategy, the way things that they, the way they thought things should be done. And

Speaker 1:          00:31:01       the thing is these guys would sit there and have this argument with, amongst themselves and with other people. And so they would, they would have these kind of fortified positions on them and you roll into it and you're like, you got your experience, but you're not ready for a debate on it. You're not ready for these fortified positions that you're, they're going to throw at you. So don't engage in these battles. And you know, it's like, uh, I was doing Sam Harris's a podcast, you know, and I, and I went up there and there were some things that I thought, well, you know, he might ask me about some of these philosophical opinions on things. And of course, I mean, I was ready to, to have a discussion, but what I wasn't ready to do was like, stand my ground on the topic of freewill, right.

Speaker 1:          00:31:49       With, with Sam Harris, a guy that's literally written an entire book, which is called free will, and he has his own. So for me to engage with him, it's an entrenched position. It's something that I'm not going to, I, I'm not going to win. And An, and in fact, you know, it's not like, it's not like Sam Harris is a pretty mellow guy. He was all, it goes, well, you're not getting in an argument, but I wasn't even gonna make any practical points. Right. You know? And so I'm just always very cautious. And again, in the business world, you get people that understand some part of their business so well, you have to be very careful and you have to plan when you're going to engage with them because otherwise you're going to get just destroyed. Yeah. Sam is a position on freewill is pretty fortified out, so, yeah, and it's, and, and, and the scary thing is, is that you can actually be right about something, but if you're going to get someone that's got a four to five position, you can still lose the argument and look stupid. Right. Not that there's anything wrong with looking stupid, but you know, you want to pick your battles. I mean, right. Yeah. Not that Sam Harris isn't right or anything like that.

Speaker 2:          00:33:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:04       Yeah, I seen in general. Yeah. No, no, no. It was, it wasn't, definitely wasn't talking specifically about, about Sam Harris. That's just a great example because again, it's a guy that's literally written a book called free will. So if he wants to talk about it, and I want to say, no, I don't agree with you, he's just ready for that. You know, just like if we said, you know what, Hey, let's, let's train Jujitsu. I'm ready for that. I've been in every position that that is going to happen in Jujitsu. I been in there a thousand more times than him. Yeah. Because I've been trading for a really long time, so we have that discussion about freewill. It's gonna be the same thing. I'm just not going to, we have bringing to the table is that kind of like the guys who PR who are really into conspiracy theories, you know, and they, if they present it to you, they're going to have all this research and websites and documents that they went to in your, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:33:54       Yeah. Even even if your facts are like stronger, they have so many other weapons and they're ready for that war. They're ready for the entrenched and fortify like are you're saying. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. That's a hard word to, to win. Yeah. Because I'm not going to go, like we've talked about before, I'm not going to go and they dig through the interwebs and watch video upon video about just to fight that war. Just to fight too. It's not even necessarily to prove anything right or wrong, it's just you gotta just fight and win that war. Yeah. The passage from the defensive to the office IV is one of the most delicate operations of war. And I actually have a uh, a note of what I think is the most difficult operation of war and that is linking up under fire. And again, you know what, now I'm talking tactically

Speaker 2:          00:34:43       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:34:44       To two people that are listening to this show that are currently serving in the military and the police linking up with other units other from the units under fire is, is one of the most difficult things to do because there's so much confusion. People are shooting, you're trying to bring friendly units together. There can be bad guys in between you and obviously if there's bad guys in between you and the other good guys and you have to shoot at the bad guys, that means you're shooting at good guys to your bullets can hit them. So it's a very, very, very challenging thing to do. So be careful when it comes time to link up under fire. And you know what I think of when I think of this,

Speaker 1:          00:35:35       I think of when you see companies merge, it's, they're, they're, you know, they're, they're moving together and there's just, it's very challenging. There's confusion. There's uh, a disorder. There is a, there is a merging of the chain of commands of two different groups. So it's, it's very challenging. And so anybody that's going into some kind of a merger scenario, you've got to recognize out of the gate that this is one of the most hardest military operations and one of the hardest business operations to do. So you've got to be aggressive with it. You've got a planet, you've got to be clear about it. You've got to do it in a simple way. Don't think that you're just going to merge two companies together and it's going to be all good. It's a very challenging event to participate in.

Speaker 1:          00:36:35       It is a violation of correct principles to cause cores to act separately without communication with each other in the face of a concentrated army with easy communications. This is the same theme, this idea that you want to stay together, you want to work together, you want to, and I'll fill this ward out there in case people didn't catch the first time I said it. The word mutually support or the words mutually support. You want to mutually support each other. Now what we find in the business world is you get different elements inside of a company that do not work together. They don't communicate with each other. And it's the same thing as being out on the battlefield and you got your platoon and I got my platoon and if we're not talking, how are we helping each other? It's we're not. And if we, if, if you try and hit the enemy and the enemy's bigger and stronger than, than you are alone.

Speaker 1:          00:37:35       Well he's going to beat you. And then if I try and you know later, even if it's an hour later, I try and hit him, well guess what? He's bigger and stronger than you and he's bigger and stronger than he's going to be me. We have to join together and work together. It's so obvious. I know it's obvious and you know what, you would think it'd be obvious to people on the battlefield and yet Napoleon himself felt the need to write that down as a maximum because people don't do it. And, and, and Lafe and I, in our book we have the, the, the law of combat called cover and move. And that's what it is. It's about mutual support. It's about working together. It's about teamwork. And it's about not having silos in your organization where one person just is going to be on their own or one elements on their own and other elements on their own and another elements on their own.

Speaker 1:          00:38:19       Are you talking about like just structurally where that's how you kind of run the business? Or are you talking about where they don't communicate because I don't really like that guy. It's both those, Oh, now what we'll structurally, I mean, you have to have things structurally, there will be separate elements structurally in the military. I mean, in the military there's, you know, there's artillery, that's a separate element. There's, you know, logistics. That's a separate element you've got, then you've got the infantry companies, and there'll be separate infantry companies, but they're all separate, but they have to work together. They have to mutually support. They have to communicate. They failed to do that. Well, in a business, you've got the same thing. You've got a sales branch, you've got an operational branch, you've got an administrative barriers. You've got to a marketing branch in, and all those branches, they have to work together too, right?

Speaker 1:          00:39:06       Yeah. So, and um, on a personal level that say, you know, I don't like Jenny from HR, so I can't stand Jenny from HR, so we're not going to, we're not going to talk to her. You know, we're just, we don't need her, you know, we're just going to continue without her kind of kind of attitude. Yes. That's a classic example. If anyone decides that for personal reasons or whatever, they're not going to work with someone else. That's exactly what I'm talking about. And it does happen in, it happens so often in businesses. It's ridiculous. And it happens in the military too. It happens in seal platoons. It happens in interservices and, and that's just a huge obstacle to overcome. And like I said, that's why Napoleon Bonaparte himself put it in his maxims. Another one, one battalion sometimes decides the issue of the day. So which battalion is that going to be? We don't know which element is going to hit that critical situation. This to me is the bringing it back to, you know, being prepared and giving, you know, making your teams strong, all of them in balancing them because one battalion or one element or one team or maybe even one person can decide the issue of the day. So balance is very important.

Speaker 2:          00:40:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:39       I just couldn't help just go and tactical with Napoleon on some of these. I really couldn't. It's just great stuff. I understand it should be adopted as a principle never to allow intervals through which the enemy can penetrate between the different cores forming, forming the line of battle. Unless you have laid a snare into which it is your object to draw him.

Speaker 1:          00:41:04       This is very simple for people that are in the military to understand it. I just kind of talked about it. If you and I are the good guys and we have guns, just you and me and we allowed a bad guy to get in between you and me and he has a gun. Now what does that do you do? You understand what that does? If I want to shoot the guy and I missed by a quarter of an inch, who does it hit? Potentially me. It hits you. It hits you because it's Murphy's law. Not even potentially it will hit you. That's Murphy's law. So you want to always, again, this goes back to you know, unity of command and having your elements working together and not allowing other elements to penetrate in between your forces.

Speaker 3:          00:41:48       Interesting. How he added. Unless it's to snare him, like unless that's like you're baiting him into a trap kind of thing. That's interesting how you added that specifically. That's kind of a dope little thing to do.

Speaker 1:          00:42:00       Yeah, it is. It. I don't know if Napoleon would've said it was a dope little thing to do, but, but it Kinda is though. That's the thing. And this is the next one. Same theme. The camps of the same army should always be so placed as to be able to sustain each other, right? You always have to be able to mutually support mutually support, as you would say. That is important. A good general good officers commissioned and noncommissioned, good organization, good instruction and strict discipline. Make good troops independently of the cause for which they are fighting independently of the cause for which they are fighting. A good general good officers commissioned and noncommissioned, good organization, good instruction and strict discipline. Make good troops independent of the cause for which they are fighting. So you can actually just have a incredibly strong force that can operate at a high level regardless of the cause that they're fighting for. Right. Just because they have those things, right?

Speaker 3:          00:43:34       Yeah. Like kind of what I've told you before, where if you, you know, you were trained in discipline, trained in all these things all the way down to just, okay. For example, if you, if you are trained in by whatever means, you're trained to show up on time every single time where you know, never be late to the point where being late could very well be the end of the world for you. Thank you. Train that hard and never being late. That's going to keep, oh, for a certain situation like you're in the military, right? So we can never be late in the military. So now when you get out, when you show up for work, when you show up for drinks with your friend, chances are you're never going to be late. Of course. And that goes for, you know, skill is the discipline and everything else you're trained in. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:44:24       The first quality, and this is now we're just going to get after it. [inaudible] the first quality of a soldier is constancy in enduring fatigue and hardship. Courage is only the second. So the first quality of a soldier is constancy in enduring fatigue and hardship. That is the, this is Napoleon Bonaparte saying that the most important thing, the most important quality of a soldier is that they, that they can endure fatigue and hardship. Courage is only second poverty, privation and want are the school of the good soldier. So now when you look at any of the elite military training,

Speaker 2:          00:45:20       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:21       Schools that those get that people could put through and well, what is it about? It's about poverty, privation, and want, you know, it's about being hungry, cold, tired, miserable. That's what they do. You know, privation, I looked at word up actually a state in which things that are essential for human wellbeing are lacking. And that's what they do. And you know, for me, you know what I was talking about, like, you know, I don't sleep a lot. I wake up early. That's one of those things that it was pretty natural to me. Luckily there's some biological genetic reason or whatever, but that was very helpful to me. Very helpful for me to not have to sleep a lot. Yeah. And being able to suffer through that well was, was beneficial. And you know, there's a lot of guys that have that, that talent and people that don't have that talent have a rough time. Yeah. As you know, as warriors in a real sense,

Speaker 1:          00:46:30       you should by all means encourage the soldiers to continue in the service. This you can easily do by testifying greatest steam for old soldiers. They do that very well in the military. You know, the older, more experienced veteran soldiers get a lot of respect. The pay should also be increased in proportion to the years in service. There was a great injustice in having no higher pay to a veteran than to recruit. So that's, that's good. Now when I read this, this didn't particularly strike me as an important maxim to bring up, but it reminded me of a story that always stuck with me. And so I was over in Ramadi and I was working with a, with a battalion called the first of the five oh six band of brothers. Sure. Red Curry, just unbelievably awesome. And our ROIC soldiers. And I went over there for a meeting with the commander of the battalion and I showed up to the meeting early.

Speaker 1:          00:47:40       Of course I was meeting him in his office and this guy was, uh, was just an incredible leader and an incredible soldier and really an incredible man that I could not have any more respect for. And I'm not saying his name right now because I don't want to interrupt his privacy and his world, you know, I don't know if he wants to have his name sat on a podcast, you know, when we talk about them in the book and I don't put his name in there either. And again, this is out of respect for people's privacy and also out of security reasons. You know, he doesn't want to have the insurgence and terrorists to the world knowing that he was this guy. So, but I will tell you this, the guy was just a fantastic leader and so I went to this meeting with him.

Speaker 1:          00:48:29       This is just a one on one meeting. I forget what we were talking about, but I showed up early and he's in there and there can hear him, you know, he's, he's kind of talking to a soldier. I can't hear what he's saying now there's just a soldier. And what's interesting about this is these, the army, see in the seal teams, when you go, when you join a seal platoon for two years or whatever, how, however long it's going be, you stay in that seal platoon, you do a workup cycle and then you go out on deployment and

Speaker 2:          00:48:59       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:49:00       the army does a little bit differently. The army, you could be three months into a year long deployment to Iraq and they will just, uh, they'll just leave. They'll, there'll be their time, their time in the army is up and they'll go home or, and then some new guy will show up and they'll be in the middle of deployment. And that's how they do it. The seal teams doesn't really do that, you know, you kind of stick together for an entire straight six or seven months. Delimit. So I show up to this meeting with the battalion commander and the soldier that was in before walks out and, uh, the colonel, I sat down and said, hey sir, how you doing? Good to see you. He's like, hey, good to see a frog man. And he said, you know what, that right there is a soldiers getting out of the army. And I said, oh, it's interesting how you guys do that. And he said, yeah. And He, and I said, uh, yeah, what do you say to these guys when they're getting out of the army and this is the middle of a deployment? And he looked at me and he said, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:50:02       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:50:02       when I deal with a soldier that's getting out of the army, he said, a lot of people will say, you can't leave us now. You know, you got to stick it out with us. You got to stay here, we need you. And he said, when I deal with a soldier that's getting out of the army, I look at him and I shake their hands and I thank you for your service. And

Speaker 1:          00:50:33       that to me was just awesome to have a totally different attitude because the seal teams is like that as well. If someone's going to get out of the seal, teams are going to be on the middle of deployment. But when you get back though, Yo, I'm getting out and everyone says all you're a quitter, or blah, blah, blah, and it's just a different attitude. And what does that, what does it tell you about your community when you say, Hey, you know what? I'm going to move on. I'm going to take care of my family. I got to, you know, I got whatever going on in my life and I'm going to get out of the seal teams. And people are like, oh, you're a quitter. And that's normal. And they do that in every branch. It's not just the seal teams. And here was this guy and his attitude was, he's going to say thank you for your service, appreciate everything you've done and I wish you the best luck. That guy is more willing to change his mind because he's like, wow, I'm working for an incredible leader of the army's awesome. Right? And that that story always stuck with me about, about how to treat people, about how to treat people. This is a guy that put his life on the line for months on end and all he did was just say thank you for your service. Yeah, that's a leader right there.

Speaker 1:          00:51:45       Next one. It is not by harangues at the moment of engaging soldiers are rendered brave veterans hardly listened to them and recruits forget them at the first discharge of a Canon, if speeches and arguments are at any time useful, it is during the course of the campaign by counteracting false reports and causes of discontent, maintaining proper spirit in the camp and furnishing subjects of conversations in bivouacs. The several objects be maybe attained by the printed orders of the day. And so this is again, as a leader in a leadership position, this, he's basically saying, look at the moment of combat all you're yelling and screaming and trying to motivate people. It was too late. The veterans like the, the veterans aren't gonna listen to you and the recruits did. Once the cannon goes off, they're not hearing you either. So your main focus needs to be, you know, during the the non firefight scenarios. That's when you get people with the mindset that's going to drive them through these bad situations. If you're trying to do this, trying to encourage people during the, during the firefight, you're late.

Speaker 2:          00:53:07       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:53:10       theme of the night. Nothing is more important in war than unity in command when therefore you are carrying on hostilities against a single power only you should have but one army acting on one line and led by one commander.

Speaker 1:          00:53:32       Does that even need explanation? Not really, no, not really. Unity of command. There are certain things in war of which the commander alone comprehends the importance. Nothing but his superior firmness and ability can subdue and surmount all difficulties. This is the burden of command. This is recognizing when you're in a command position and when you're in a leadership position, there are some things that are yours alone and you have to drive from the top. And I talk all the time about leadership being at every level and how the lowest ranking guy is a leader and the person above him as leader all the way through the whole chain of command. But this statement, which I agree with, as much as I know that leadership throughout the chain of command is infinitely important. It is important as a leader to understand that there's some things that you and you alone are going to understand, and it's your responsibility to ensure that that piece of the battle is handled correctly.

Speaker 2:          00:54:43       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:54:52       This one's a little bit long. I'm going to read it anyways, to authorize generals and officers to lay down their arms by virtue of a special capitulation to under any other circumstances than when they constitute the garrison of a four to five place would unquestionably a be attended with dangerous consequences. To open this door to cowards, to men wanting an energy or even misguided, brave men is to destroy the military spirit of a nation from Napoleon. There can be no surrender.

Speaker 2:          00:55:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:32       An extraordinary situation requires extraordinary resolution.

Speaker 2:          00:55:37       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:55:39       Note taken underlined in red and extraordinary situation requires extraordinary resolution. How many things apparently impossible have nevertheless been performed by resolute men who had no alternative but death,

Speaker 1:          00:56:02       strong words, very strong words. And we could go throughout military history and find case upon case where I would tell you yes, absolutely that commander made a wise decision to surrender. And you know that's, there are situations where that happens. But I think the main point of this is that to have that out there, to have that as a thing, right, right. Is Not Smart, is not smart. And you know, going in with MMA fighters and telling him, I'm like, listen, if you get caught in a submission, don't tap, let it break. If you get could a choke go to sleep, just Dee Dee, there's no submission. You are not tapping. Now I've said that to guys and I've had some guys get out of some crazy submissions that they should have tapped and maybe they got a little bit injured, but they got out. And I've also had guys get caught in like some devastating submissions and been like, Oh, you know what?

Speaker 1:          00:57:07       Okay, I'm going to tap because, but the fact that that attitude wasn't out there. Right, okay. And that like, like, okay, you know what if you get caught, you know what I mean? You're not going to say to a fighter, okay, look, if you could call it in a bad arm lock, you know, just tap. No, no. If you're going out on a bad arm lock, get out of it in competitions. Let him break an MMA fight. Yeah. I mean obviously not. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Well, yeah, in training, sorry folks, if you're in training, tap early and tapped often.

Speaker 3:          00:57:38       Yeah. Okay. So when you say having that be a thing that's out there, meaning there's almost no, I don't want to see a shame, but almost like etiquette is to nuts. Surrender. That's etiquette. And it's so much an etiquette where it's here, you don't surrender. Here it is. It's written in plain English. Don't swear it. Right,

Speaker 1:          00:57:56       right. And it's not even an etiquette. There's a better word for it. There's a word, I don't know what it is, but it's not etiquette. It's, it's our ethos, right? It's our ethos is do not surrender.

Speaker 3:          00:58:08       Right. So when someone does surrender, when it's a good move, how you say like every once in a while there is, it's like, man, there was literally no other option that could be conceived.

Speaker 1:          00:58:20       Yeah. Yeah. But to not have it out there, you know that that commander took it to the nth degree and said, you know what? All of my men are going to die for no reason now if I continue on with us, so therefore we are going to surrender and an and hopefully we'll come back to fight another day.

Speaker 3:          00:58:36       Yeah. Otherwise, yeah, it's, if, you know, if, if I don't know someone even has this much mental weakness going in and he could get and that could kick in at a whole nother time and now he's under this certain kind of mindset that, man, I could look for the easiest way out right here. You got real tired or man, my shoulder got hurt on that last one. So maybe I'll just, you know, but if he's in that mindset that don't give up, you just can't surrender, he won't even consider that. That wouldn't even enter his mind.

Speaker 1:          00:59:08       That's what I'm talking about. That's exactly what I'm talking about. Such conduct, such conduct ought to be prescribed, pronounced, infamous and punishable with death. The generals, officers and soldiers who in battle have saved their lives by capitulating, ought to be decimated. He commands the arms to be surrendered and those who obey him are unlike traders and deserve capital punishment. So they saying if you give up, you should give up the guy. That's exactly what they're saying. That's exactly what they're saying.

Speaker 1:          00:59:47       Now we're going to get in a little bit of a, something that we now refer to as extreme ownership. A general in chief cannot exonerate himself from responsibility for for his faults, by pleading an order of his sovereign or the minister, when the individual from whom it proceeds is at a distance from the field of operations and but partially or not at all acquainted with the actual conditions of things. So you, if I tell you to do something and it doesn't go well for you, you're out in the field and I told you, hey, charge this machine gun nest and you do it. And everyone dies and you come back and say, hey, it wasn't my fault, the [inaudible] fault. The point is here. No, it doesn't work that way. Does not work that way.

Speaker 2:          01:00:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:41       Hence

Speaker 1:          01:00:44       it follows that every general and treat chief who undertakes to execute a plan, which he knows to be bad, is culpable. So if I tell you to go attack that machine gun nest and you know it's a bad plan and you executed anyways, your fault, that's kind of like, I mean, that whole idea is you take responsibility for your direct actions, right? So it's kind of like if you do the opposite of that, it's like, okay, I, you know, I was speeding, I got caught speeding, I got a ticket. Is that my fault? Because yes, it's my fault. But in a way, if I don't want to exercise this concept, in a way it's my parents fault for having me or maybe not teaching me the value of following traffic, uh, I'm not gong to have this discussion with you. That's just completely ridiculous. It's the same thing.

Speaker 1:          01:01:36       No, you can't blame your parents for your speeding echo, Charles. That's what I'm saying. I'll let you do that. That's the point. That's the point of making it. That's the point here is that if you're doing something, if this is even more of an extreme point, this is if your parents tell you to speed and you go out and get caught speeding and pulled over and you go, Hey, my parents told me to spray even more directly. Yeah. That's what I'm saying is you knew it was wrong. You knew you shouldn't be doing it, and what Napoleon is saying is it's your fault. You're culpable. Gotcha. Period. Period. Would you suggest, let's say period, you knew it was wrong. Would a better plan of action be expressed that you know that the the or whatever is wrong? Yeah. You should be like, Hey, I'm not doing this.

Speaker 1:          01:02:21       Oh, in fact, he goes on. He should communicate his reasons, insist on a change of plan and finally resign his commission rather than become the instrument of the, of his army's ruin. This is just the, this is the most, probably the most powerful thing we're going to talk about tonight. I'm going to read it again. A general and Treif cannot exonerate himself from responsibility for his faults by pleading an order of his sovereign or the minister, when the individual from whom it proceeds is at a distance from the field of operations and but partially or not at all acquainted with the actual condition of things. So this is a, this is an order that's coming on from high, from somebody that doesn't know. Hence, it follows that every general in chief who undertakes to execute a plan, which he knows to be bad, is culpable. He should communicate his reasons, insist on a change of plan, and finally resign his commission. So quit his job rather than become an instrument of his army's ruin. Every general in chief who in consequence of orders from his superiors gives battle with the certainty of defeat is equally culpable.

Speaker 1:          01:03:36       This is ownership. This is, hey, I got told to do something. I don't agree with it. Hey boss, look, you gotta listen to me here. This is not the way we need to execute this. Here's a better plan. Here's another plan. Here's a, here's an alternative. Because if you give battle with the certainty of defeat, you're culpable regardless of who told you to do what individual responsibility, and this is especially important to have this concept coming from somebody that was as egotistical and expected so much discipline from his troops to have Napoleon himself saying this, like if it's a bad order, you shouldn't do it. This is Napoleon saying this. So that's how important it is to have this, this culture in your organization to make sure that everybody knows, regardless of what you get told, you've got to do the right thing. And it's everyone's individual responsibility to take extreme ownership of everything that's happening and not just say, you know what? I'm going to point my point, my finger up the chain of command. I blame them when something goes wrong. I've talked about this before. You know how many times I blamed my bosses for things that went wrong? Zero. Never blamed my bosses it. How could it ever be their fault? I was in charge and if they told me to do something that was stupid, I would tell him, look, I'm not doing that. Here's why. Let's find a better way.

Speaker 1:          01:05:14       The first qualification of a general in chief is to possess a cool head so that things may appear to him in their true proportions and as they really are. It's beautiful. It's a beautiful statement to possess a cool head so that things may appear to him in their true proportions and as they really are, he should not suffer himself to be unduly affected by good or bad news.

Speaker 1:          01:05:49       The impressions which are made upon his mind successively or simultaneously in the course of a day should be so classified in his memory that each shell occupy its proper place for sound reasoning and judgment result from first examining each of these varied impressions by itself and then comparing them all with one another. So you're gonna hear all these things, all these different impressions. You're going to get rumors, gossip reports, probably heard this, the first report in war is always wrong can to hear all that stuff and you got an, you got to detach from it. You can't get emotional. You got to categorize them. And then once you hear them all, you can look at them and assess them all in their own light.

Speaker 2:          01:06:38       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:06:39       There are reason they're there. There are some men who from their physical and moral constitution deck, everything in the colors of imagination with whatever knowledge, talents, courage, or other good qualities. These may be endowed. Nature has not fitted them for the command of armies and the direction of the great operations of war. So anybody that gets emotional, that clot, that debt, here's something and let's it cloud. They're decisions that gets too close to problems. They're not cut out to lead and war. And I 100% agree with that and they're not cut out to lead in any situation.

Speaker 2:          01:07:17       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:07:27       To be familiar with the geography and topography of the country, to be skillful in making reconnaissance, to be attentative to the dispatch of orders, to be capable of exhibiting with simplicity, the most complicated movements of an army.

Speaker 1:          01:07:46       These are qualifications that should distinguish the officer called to the station of Chief of staff, and my favorite of those is to be capable of exhibiting with simplicity. The most complicated movements of the army. I talk about all the, this all the time. It's a one of our laws of combat. It's a chapter in extreme ownership that we wrote about and simplicity and a lot of times we talk about giving clear, concise orders, simple, clear and concise orders. So that's, that's another mark of someone that can lead well is someone that can take complex ideas, simplify them and communicate them in a simple manner that like, you know how in Jujitsu you'll, you'll like people name move. Yes, they'll do like give, move the name, but each move we'll have like, you know, four, five, six, 10 parts to that move details that are important to make the move, you name it one move, you've learned that whole move.

Speaker 1:          01:08:45       So it takes these complex orders or move and simplifies it. Yes. Especially when you're communicating do this, he just said, and there there are, I mean there definitely are coaches that can take complex moves and break them down very simply and that is, that is what makes her good instructor, right? That is what makes a good instructor is someone that can explain to you exactly what you do with your weight, exactly where you put your forearm exactly and then and then explained to you that you know what? This might be a little bit different from you for you because you're a different human, but here's exactly what I do and here's the effect that I'm looking for when I do it. Very simple. That's what we're looking for. The first principle of a general in chief is to calculate what he must do, to see if he has all the means to surmount the obstacles with which the enemy can oppose him and when he has made his decision to do everything to overcome them.

Speaker 1:          01:09:46       Again, that's to me is about commitment. Next war is composed of nothing but accidents and Avo holding to general principles. A general should never lose sight of everything to enable him to profit from these accidents. That is the mark of a genius in war. There is, but one favorable moment moment. The great art is to seize it. It's a business. Obviously Jujitsu, obviously fighting, obviously these, that's just, there's, there's moments, there's opportunity, there's opportunity. And when you, when you have that opportunity, the art is to seize it. Very simply. Defensive War does not exclude attacking, just as offensive war does not exclude defending, although its aim may be to force the frontier and invade the enemy's country. I just think it's important to not only think about, hey, you should be attacking and defending at the same time and defending and attacking at the same time. But also we got to remember the, the contradiction in the fact that he's a guy that talks about offense, offense, offense, but even he has to balance that with defense. Even Napoleonic has to balance things. And we'll do the last one, uh, doubtful general who acts without principles and without plan. Even though he lead, even though he lead an army numerically superior to that of the enemy, almost always finds himself inferior to the ladder on the field of battle. Fumblings the middle course lose all in war.

Speaker 1:          01:11:53       And I just liked the fact that he's talking about principled leadership. And I would say that principled leadership, not just in a leadership position, but as a person, what are your principles as a person? And if you have principles as a human and you stand by those principles, you're going to be successful. You're going to win. Whereas if you take the middle course and you waiver or the you don't just don't have principles on which to stand, then you fall apart. And

Speaker 1:          01:12:36       I think that everybody should look to define what their principles are actually defined them. I can tell you that. I would love to tell you that when I was, you know, 19 years old, I sat down and wrote down Jockos principles of life. I didn't do that. I, I wish I would have. And I, and I can tell you that as I grew up in the seal teams there, I probably added principles and I, and I added some bad ones and I had some good ones. And I think that those, those principles though, when you get to a point where you know that your principals are solid. And honestly to me the best or the, the biggest thing I've done to define the principles that I live by is really the book that life. And I wrote extreme ownership. That's the, that was the culmination of 20 years in the seal teams and putting together the principles that, that, that I live by and,

Speaker 1:          01:13:40       and to survive by. So I think it's just very important to think about what your principles are as a person, what you're trying to achieve and have those principles like a guiding strategy underneath everything that you're doing. Right. And that's one thing that's good about these podcasts is that, you know, I'm, I'm, I've been lucky enough to capture some of these, you know, like the, the letters that we read last time, these counseling letters, I'm talking about my personal principles in those, those were my principles on how to lead. And so I think it's important to come up with those principles and define them and let those principals reflect you, know who you are as a person and what you want to be. And I wish that I would have been told to do that when I was 13 years old because I think it is that important as a person.

Speaker 3:          01:14:38       Yeah. And it, it seems like anyway that defining your principles, it seems like that's a, um, that's kind of an ongoing process. Yes. Because it's one of the things where you think you have your principles, you know, but I don't know, for example, you, you could have just heard it on some speech that really resonated with you so you, Oh Dang. You think you have these specific principles now, but you haven't really defined them. You just kind of liked how that sounded. And you may be thought of one, two, three situations where the Dane that applies to me and let me tell you

Speaker 1:          01:15:13       what you're talking about right now. Your number one principle should be free your mind and, and, and have humility to never say, the principles that I'm standing upon are never going to change because I know everything right now. And we've talked about this before. Yes, I know. I would never, if I look at myself 10 years ago, I know nothing compared to what I know now. If I looked at myself 20 years ago, I know even last, I'm just a lost animal out in the woods. So you have to, you know, build these principles and like you said, and I think there's a difference between being a flip flopper like, you know, you hear politicians get, you know, oh, you're a flip flopper because you said you don't support gun control and now you, and now you, you're, you do support it. Now you don't support her, whatever you do support bringing in refugees or not.

Speaker 1:          01:16:04       So, and people will get to call the flip flopper and, and I actually, I think there's some core principles that shouldn't change even for a politician and even for a person. But there's a lot of peripheral, you know, I think there's peripheral principles that do evolve and do change and you do end up with different priorities in your life. And I think that's okay. You know, there was a large portion of my life, what were the seal teams was absolutely the most important thing and nothing else was even a close second, including things like my personal health, including things like my own family, including things like my future, the everything was just completely unimportant compared to the seal teams. And while that makes for a fired up seal and I wouldn't trade that, I wouldn't even want to change that principle. I mean that's what I needed at the time to do a good job.

Speaker 1:          01:17:05       But you know, at some point I had to say, okay, I I need to think about something else. You know, I need to evolve as a human and in, you know, little things like I need to take care of my family, you know, I need to actually pay attention to them and not just pay attention to my seal platoon or my seal task unit or the guys I'm working with. So you, so I think it's okay to evolve your principles, but I think more important is that you need to define your principles and where you are. And that also is a way to check your growth and see what course you're on. You know, this is one thing that I talk about when I was in the seal teams. I used to talk about this, the most important piece of information on the battlefield. What do you think the most important piece of information on the battlefield is? Echo.

Speaker 1:          01:17:59       Echo has no idea. I can come up with an idea, but it'll take a little bit. Yeah. So I used to ask that question to everybody, to senior guys, junior guys, and they'd all kinds of, you know, where you know where the bad guys are, what you know, where the target is. I mean everyone would have different answers and there's actually only one answer. The most important piece of information that you can have on the battlefield is where you are, is to know where you are on the battlefield. Do you know where you're at if you don't know where you're at? Does it really matter if you know where the enemy is? No. Cause you don't even know where you are if you don't know where you're at. Can you even navigate correctly? No. Cause you don't even know where you are. If you don't know where you're at.

Speaker 1:          01:18:44       Can you get close air support? Can you call for aircraft to come in and drop bombs? No. You don't even know where you are. So that piece of datum, when will you, when you apply that to life, how do you know where you are if you're not tracking what your principles are? The answer is you're not. You're not gonna, you're not gonna know where you are and you're not going to see how you evolve. And when I work with businesses, I use the same principles. Businesses will go out and operate off of instinct. Now you have to trust your instinct and you have to understand it, but you also have to track what the facts are. You know what I'm saying? Like where are your metrics? How do you know what you did last year, this time in profitability? How do you know what you did in sales?

Speaker 1:          01:19:29       How do you know what you did in product development? If you're not tracking it, you don't know where you are on the battlefield and if you don't know where you are in the battlefield year lost. So the year principals kind of just continue to be more and more informed. You know how like you do, you talk about when you're 13 or 16 however old where you think you have these principles, because I don't know, you listen to Henry Rollins, they're there, but as you conduct yourself through life with an open mind and all these, you're offered all these different perspective that start to solidify your principles. So you talk about the difference between a flip flopper in someone who's

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       who evolves openminded and evolves. Yeah, the differences that someone who continuously evolves, we'll have an open mind at the same time have pretty concrete principles. Yes. So when they're offered something significant, that is simply a difference in perspective. That is gonna that's going to essentially on a, in a fundamental way aligned with their principals. Their principles are fairness. And you know, these, these things that are in arguably good as far as being part of the principles, they're gonna evolve when these

Speaker 1:          01:20:40       separate perspectives get presented to them and thus solidifying their principals even more. Yes. In Echo, just use the word thus. And I liked that. I liked that. That's true. And I think that's a good, good thing to keep in mind as you know, people move forward is what are your principles? How are they evolving? How are they improving? Have they gotten better? Those are great questions for every individual to ask. And those are questions I'm asking myself right now on the Jocko podcast live. It's happening. So speaking of which, we got some questions. Speaking of questions, speaking of questions, the first question in episode five, you mentioned treating people with a blank slate.

Speaker 1:          01:21:34       How do you deal with misjudging a person in the event of you? Misjudging yeah. So that was, you know, in reference to a person that, that we went through a counseling sheet on. And the fact was it, I'd heard some bad stuff about them, you know, bad. He had a bad reputation, et cetera. And so I was saying that, hey, you know, I, I treat everyone like a blank slate. And so first of all, I talked about this before, is I set low expectations for people. I don't have a super high expectations of what they're gonna do and how well they're going to deliver. And actually somebody hit me on Twitter today and said something along the lines of, I like the fact that everyone with you starts at zero, right. And, um, and he said, I'm the same way. He's in. He was the same way.

Speaker 1:          01:22:27       And I think that's a, that's a pretty good attitude. Dab, like everyone starts at zero and you know, and, and that's a better way to put it in my opinion. Expectations. Yeah. Like are you okay? You have a zero. And, and again, I don't mean to sound like a negative person, but I just don't set high expectations. I said, I'm a zero. Right? Look, you show me who you are. I'm not going to predict one way or the other. I understand that people do crazy things and people are crazy in many ways. Their ego, their personality, their issues. I mean people, their emotions, people do things. So I don't, that's another thing that keeps me from giving people all kinds of credit out of the gate. And, and I do weigh what other people say. You know, I take it into account, but I definitely am careful to use my own judgment and not cloud my vision with what somebody else said about so-and-so.

Speaker 1:          01:23:26       So how do I deal with misjudging a person? It's Kinda what we were just talking about. I don't set permanent judgment on someone and say echoes bad and I don't like him and I don't trust him. That's not a permanent thing. You know, I, I'm gonna build from zero and I'm going to say, Oh, you know what, actually, hey, he did a good job with that. Or, Hey, you had my back on that. So I'm not stuck in my ways and I don't, I don't hold grudges against people and say, this person's never going to change. That being said, man, it's hard to change the spots of the leopard. You know, people are who they are and it's a very difficult, yes sir. Some people can grow and change and evolve and that's great, but a lot of people, they are who they are and so you have to take that into account as well,

Speaker 3:          01:24:17       right? Yeah. When you say like trusting someone wins, let's say someone burns you in whatever way and then you know, a week later, whatever, they had your back in a way that was really unexpected compared to, you know, that action that they did. So basically what that does is help paint an overall picture of what kind of person this is to you. So where it's like, okay, maybe I can trust them in this type of situation when these benefits and detriments or are in play and these other situations I can't. So it's kind of this, and then as you have more and more experienced with people, they paint more of a picture. Yeah. So trust even saying trust is such a broad brush, right. You know, it's certain incentives are involves involved. You can't trust a certain person to do or not do certain things, but offer up different incentives. Then you know you can trust them.

Speaker 1:          01:25:02       I think the same thing that you're just saying is what I'm saying is I don't, I'm not going to miss judge someone because my judgment is not a permanent all, all powerful statement of one time. Yeah. I'm constantly looking at people and like you said, learning impressions of their whole, their whole entity, what they're all about next.

Speaker 3:          01:25:26       So starting out in Jujitsu, how do you find a good gym in your area?

Speaker 1:          01:25:34       Okay, so this is actually a question. You know, we plot to one out of many of people that have hit us up on, on Twitter about where to find a good Brazilian Jujitsu Gym. Because people, I think people have heard us talking about Jujitsu and they heard me talking about it with Joe Rogan. You know her, we talking about what Tim Ferriss, I mean it's something that I talk about something that is definitely a big part of my life. I know it's a big part of your life as well. And so people think, you know, I'd like to check out and I think that's awesome. And if you're out there and you're going to ask me if you should start Jujitsu and you're going to give me a whole bunch of quantifiers that you're old or you work a lot, are you, you've been sick or you've been injured or whatever you're going to tell me and I can tell you 99.9 99 99.9% of the time, my answer is going to be yes, you should start Jujitsu.

Speaker 1:          01:26:25       Except if your sickness is contagious except of your sickness is contagious. Or if you're a bully or you're a sadist, if you're an evil person that's hungry for power, I'm, I'm going to tell you, don't start Jujitsu because you're going to use it for bad things. Yeah. And even before that, I think you might get it turned on you. You know how like, cause it's really easy to depends on the school, but for the most part it's really easy to spot a believe when it comes to the gym and it and it doesn't farewell well it doesn't feel it'll maybe farewell for a day or even maybe one five minute matches, something like that. But man it doesn't, yeah, Jujitsu is a self regulating. See for the most part, yes. As self regulating seen very few people can maintain and and most people with bully bullying attitudes don't have the humility to continue in Jujitsu for a long time anyways.

Speaker 1:          01:27:22       Yes, yes. So that's another way that it's self polices. So how do you find a good, a Jujitsu Gym? Obviously you start with Google, you find out some locations. To me proximity is very important. So you want a place that's, you know, on your way to work on your way home from work close to your house. So somewhere that you're going to get in there and train because you don't want to sign up for a gym and never go because it's too far to out of the way. So proximity is definitely a factor. Then you got to ask yourself, what are you looking for? Because Jujitsu gyms very tremendously in how they're set up, how they're run and all those things. I mean there's really super traditional Brazilian Jujitsu gyms where they, you bow before you get on the mat, you bow after your, you bow to the instructor when you're going to talk to him.

Speaker 1:          01:28:12       You are very, they're very strict with uniforms. So you know, only a white uniform, you have to have this certain patch on your uniform to represent the school. That's, that's one type of atmosphere that you could have. Then you could have a very loose atmosphere where it's like, you know, you're gonna come in, you're going to train. There is no bowing. There's handshakes and there's respect, but it's not as overt and not as imposed as it would be in a more traditional Brazilian Jiu Jitsu school. So what are you looking for? You know, for me, I always, you know, and, and if you come to my gym, it's a very, it's a very relaxed atmosphere in terms of traditionally imposed discipline. But when you roll there will be disciplined in post. But it's pretty dynamic though. Like we have such a big group of people that to go in there and in to get a non competitive role is you can easily do that.

Speaker 1:          01:29:10       That's true. In fact, you, it's easy to choose. It's either easy to be like, okay, I know Liz role with this group and it's gonna. It's going be, I'm going to go here with this crew today and they're going to bring in, or you know what? I'm going to show what these guys over here and we're going to work on some technique and maybe I can ask this guy about that. Yeah. So that's, that's good. That is good. Um, you know, there's also a, are you going to go to a school that's very focused on sport Jujitsu, which is, hey, we're going to compete, we're going to learn the techniques that are very applicable to two competing in Jujitsu. Yeah. Um, or am I going to do something that's more towards self defense and or MMA. And a classic example I think of that is the, uh, is the 50, 50 guard where in this position in Jujitsu, if you don't know Jujitsu, where if you're in a no rule situation, you're very vulnerable to a devastating submission called the heel hook.

Speaker 1:          01:30:09       And so it's, but there's, there's certain competition rules that don't allow for heel hooks and that position. So depending on what kind of school you're at, one of them you're going to get, you're going to be in a, in a different situation in that then that one position. And, and you know, actually at our school we do, we do both. But do you want to do MMA focus? Do you want to do GI or no GI? And again, there's benefits to both those and they're both fun. And I like training both. Um, so, so you kind of kind of think about what you're looking for and then, and then bring that into the school and, and then go try some classes, take some classes at a school and see what they're like. What are the other students like, you know, what kind of atmosphere is it a, do they have like the similar goals?

Speaker 1:          01:30:57       If you want to compete, if that's your goal, then are the other people that you talk to, are they like, yeah, I compete all the time. There's a tournament coming up or are they like, yeah, you know, we can beat sometimes. Or actually I don't care about competing because there's plenty of people that train Jiu Jitsu. They don't care about competing. Is there, you know, what's the attitude? What's is their egos are people rolling? If you try to kill you, which, which 99% of the time and a Jujitsu school is not going to happen, but it can happen, it can happen. So what WWE and then, and then it's like, what was the instructor like? Is the instructor personal? Is it is the instructor, you know what we were talking about earlier, is he clearer as you concise as he understand, can you understand him? Can you understand the way he's explaining moves now there's, you got to give a little leeway there.

Speaker 1:          01:31:41       If you jump into a class that's an advanced class, you're not going to understand everything. You know, and people ask me on how to get started on Jujitsu and I tell him to go immersion training just like a language. Just get in there and start training and you're going to get destroyed at first and then you're going to slowly learn and the next thing you know that's fastest way to learn languages to get an immersed in it and do the same thing with Jujitsu. Is The instructor having fun? Is the guy having fun or the girl? Are they having fun teaching? Is it a fun thing? Because you want you Jitsu to be fun and you want the instructor to be having fun because there's instructors not having fun. Well then what? You know, what are they going to be like in six months if they're not having fun today?

Speaker 1:          01:32:23       And then what, what are they going to be like in six months? So that's, that's another important piece when you talk about what, um, what you're looking for, you know, in, in Jujitsu and in my experience, there's so many elements of it to look for. Like if, you know, when you, if you say, okay, am I, do I want to learn MMA learning MMA or fighting? Is the sport of fighting compared to like for example, the, the, the Gracie Academy Torrance there. Do you do to self defense in regards to fighting getting into a fight or if someone attacks you in a fight that's way different than training in MMA training. MMA is a sport of MMA. You're going to learn a lot of moves. The, you're not, you're probably not going to learn things that a quote unquote an attacker, I mean you will, but it's not focused on that.

Speaker 1:          01:33:13       You're not gonna learn stuff that an attacker is going to do to you. So in that differentiation is just the fighting part alone. It's not to mention the competition part, the Biggie, the Nogi, the, you know, all these dynamic moves. Like, if you go 10th planet and 10th Planet compared to like Gracie Academy, Torrance are almost like two different sports almost yet. And they are, but at the same time, you're going to get, you're going to get Jujitsu, that that's a, you're going to get you to do for you and it, and that's the important thing is you can't judge it too. And just like we talked about the evolution of your principals, let your, you know, your game should evolve as well. And almost everybody that's never done Jujitsu before. If you said, well, why do you want to take Jujitsu? 90% of them are going to say, oh, self defense, right?

Speaker 1:          01:33:58       Because you know, people say, I want to learn to defend myself. There's not too many people that are going to be saying, you know what, I really have become interested in this cerebral aspect of Jujitsu, which maybe some people that listen to us talk about it or listen to Joe Rogan talk about it, you know, they'll say, oh, that guy's talking about this thing as if it's a very cerebral experience. So maybe someone but, but most people, yeah, I want to learn how to defend my cell phone and make sure so, but you're going to evolve past that because after six months of training, you can handle yourself on the street regardless. If you went to 10th or you went to the Gracie Academy, you're going to be able to handle yourself in the street. And so then it becomes an obsession of how did that move happen. And so that's what you got to, that's what you got to be ready to evolve. And when you're at that point, if you go to school a versus if you went to school, be your experience is going to be a lot different and it's going to depend on what you were looking for in the beginning. But nonetheless, yeah, if, if it is

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       obviously if it's a Jujitsu school yeah. That, that, that part's not really going to change. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:35:03       You're going to learn Jujitsu, which is a beautiful thing. The other thing that I got to say is you got it Jujitsu. As much as I love it, Jujitsu is not a religion. And you know, the, the black belt instructor at the school does not have contact or direct communications with God. Right? So just I think, keep that in mind. It's a person that is trained in a sport for longer than you. Okay? So just keep that in mind. It's not a cult there. There should be an open atmosphere. In my opinion. You should be looking for a Jujitsu school that has an open atmosphere, not a cult controlling atmosphere. Um, you know, that being said, and, and I said this already, respect. Yes, absolutely. You should respect the people that are there and respect your training partners and respect your instructors for sure. But you shouldn't be worshiping them and they shouldn't be expecting you to worship them.

Speaker 1:          01:36:14       So just be advised, because Jujitsu, it should be fun. It should be friendly, it should be engaging. The atmosphere should be good and it should be competitive without being cutthroat. You know, you, you should want to go without fear of having a death match every single night, unless that's what you're looking for. And you just said that echo, I mean like I go in every night looking for a death match against Dean, against you, against Andy, against Craig or Greg. I mean our crew of murderers, I'm, I'm going in for a death match every night. And even when I don't want to death match, I give it to them because, because that's how I'm getting better. And that's part of my own personal will to say, you know what? Regardless, I'm in there to put it on the line and, and throw it out there. And if they get the best of me, cool. So be it. I learned I got better and I definitely got better than I would if I was either a sitting on the side of the mat, be rolling with someone that's not as good or see staying at home. So yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:37:16       Yeah. That's so interesting how, how it really does accommodate who you are. Like you, when you, when you go in looking for it, a death match every night, that totally makes sense because of who you are and who I understand you to be. But at the same time, in the same gym? On the same mat. Yeah. Yeah. He can have, there's people chilling and in who's, you know, he's, you know, he ends up getting his black belt, a bunch of knowledge, but he's not going for any death match, you know, older guy. Um, that's what's so in my opinion, good about it. Yeah. So eight accommodates who you are so much like me, I do both like some days death match. Sure. But most days, just like once every, every

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       two weeks, once every two weeks we get the death match. Rebecca? Uh, so yeah, go out there, enjoy Jujitsu, but we'll make sure you don't fall into a cult. Next, do you eat fruit? And if so, how often? And if not, why not? No. So, okay. Do I eat fruit? Sometimes I eat fruit, but if you were to ask me if you should eat fruit, I would basically say no. I don't recommend it. And again, this is just a, if you talk to Dom D'agostino, who's a doctor or Mister Paleo himself, Robb Wolf, have you, if you go and listen to his podcast or doctor Peter Attia, who I've talked about before, these guys, they know what they're talking about and they will tell you what I'm telling you and these guys will back it up with science, upon science, upon science, fruit, carbohydrates, Spike your insulin level, just not good for you. Um, again, am I an extremist? No. Have some blueberries. Get your blueberries on. Get your blackberries on. That's awesome. But take a bunch of fruit and put it with some apple juice and mix it up in a blender and eat, you know, 400 grams of carbohydrate in one shot. No, don't do that. It's not good for you.

Speaker 1:          01:39:30       Have you ever eaten, and I'm not saying when you're on the program, so to speak, have you ever eaten a whole box of donuts? Negative? Have you ever eaten, ate a bag of Hershey's kisses than it did not make, did not work out good? When you say you don't eat fruit, that's more of like when you're on the program, right? Yeah. And did your, you want to know when I'm on the program? Yeah, but when, when are you on the wall? But yeah, I when when you're, when you're trying to eat clean, which you should be trying to eat clean 80% of the time as anyone will tell you, um, you know, keep it clean and, and keep it to, you know, fat and in protein. If you can do it, little bit of a subject change. When, if ever, is it a good time to blow up at someone to lose your temper will blow up at someone and lose your temper?

Speaker 1:          01:40:30       Two different things, right? Does I think, is it good? I think, I think most people would think that they are the same thing. Losing your temper and blowing up at someone. And I can tell you that is almost never good to do that. And when I say almost never, I mean never with the tiniest caveat of there is some possible scenarios where it might need to happen. So if you lose your temper and you blow up at somebody, what do you, what are you showing? You're showing that you can't control your temper. And if you can't control your temper, then what can you control? Right? That the, and I'm not saying you should show no emotions because if you show no emotions in your robot and robots can't lead people and people don't follow robots. So there's some, obviously some level of showing emotions is needed.

Speaker 1:          01:41:22       But if you're losing your temper, you're not thinking clearly. And if you're not thinking clearly because you've lost your temper, you can't even read their reactions to what you're saying and you're, the fact that you're blowing up is, is clouding your own vision. The fact that you're losing your temper is clouding your own vision. And so you got to detach in order to be observant in order to watch what your actions are. So if you do have to blow up and when, okay, so when, when is this almost never happened? If you, if you were working for me and you did something wrong and I said echo and it was grievous, it was like pretty grievous. Like it could've got someone hurt and I said, echo, hey, do this was bad. This is what happened. I don't know what I did wrong that thought that made you think that would be okay.

Speaker 1:          01:42:18       But whatever I image I gave you that made you think this was okay, I, this is the worst mistake I've ever made. We can never let this happen again. Okay. And you're like, yeah, okay. And then four days later you do it again. And I'd come at the same approach, maybe a little bit different. Like, Hey, echo, I don't know if there's anything I could do to make this more clear than I did. What can I do to make you understand? So we might go three or four or five iterations, maybe one more iteration, I should say three iterations of you, not you failing to do what you're supposed to do and getting someone hurt her almost getting someone hurt. So now I go, okay, he hasn't listened to the indirect approach. He hasn't listened to the direct approach. He hasn't. I've taken ownership of it.

Speaker 1:          01:43:03       He hasn't taken any yet. I need to come at them from different angles. Okay, I need to lose my temper with them and it's going to be a calculation and I won't actually lose my temporary, but I will raise my voice. I will get loud. I will point and I will make damn sure that you understand that this infraction that you have committed is severe and grievous and can never happen again. And that's the situation where I would quote unquote blow up at somebody. It is so rare that it's so rare that in my military career off the top of my head, I can remember one and only one incident of this where I actually said, you know what? This, this was a bad mistake. I could see where these guys think they might be able to get away with us again in the future and I'm going to make sure that they realize that was it the kind where they, it's not like they made the same mistake. It was more like they chose to do something, they chose to do something a certain way. And in my, my assessment of it was that they would do it again if I didn't make it perfectly clear that this could never happen again. And so I raised my voice, I pointed in the face and you know, gave them 20 seconds of, of intensity and the situation never happened again and they apologized.

Speaker 1:          01:44:39       But overall not a good thing. Don't lose your temper people don't do it. Yeah. I would say losing your temper, not blowing up at someone, losing your template for losing it. You can be hard. It's going to be hard to think of a situation where that's cool. Yeah. Okay. And I'll tell you, you want to know when I lose my temper or cause I'll tell you, I do lose my temper. It happens once every six months and it is almost always with inanimate objects, namely objects that print or copy or compute in some way. You know, electronics, sometimes I, I get, I get angry. Yeah, you're going to probably want to keep that in private areas, right. You don't want people to see that. Yeah. Like my wife will hear me once every six months, you know? And she'll come in and she'll be like a printer then. Oh yeah. She says you're stupid. I go, I know. She goes, it doesn't care if you yell at it. I say, yeah, I know. I might experience that. I found the same thing looking. We're looking. Okay, here's the next question. Your specific lifting workout, your weekly training schedule, including Jujitsu.

Speaker 1:          01:45:58       This is a big question. And this, for those of you that do Jujitsu out there in the world, this is like when someone says, Hey, Hey Jocko, how do I pass your guard? Cause I have a good guard. And so you know someone that is a blue belch, we'll say, you know, hey, how do I pass your guard? You know, and they, and, and literally I have guys at the gym that are brown belts and black belts that pass my guard once every six months, you know, so my guard is good and you know, here's a blue belt. Like, hey, how do I pass your guard? So this, this question kind of reminds me of that a little bit. Um, specific lifting workout and weekly training schedule on Jujitsu. So this is a, this is a big ask. And here's the problem that I have with us.

Speaker 1:          01:46:49       I'm an individual and I have strengths and weaknesses. I have whatever little injury thing that I'm working through at a particular time. I have things that I liked to do and I have things that I don't like to do. I have, um, I'm an individual and my workout is for me and, and I've taken, and I've, you know, sometimes people, I'll go on a trip and there'll be a guy that's an athlete and he'll say, oh, do I, you know, I want to, I want to go through one of your workouts with you. And I say, okay. And I've done that. And, and I've had guys,

Speaker 2:          01:47:27       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:47:27       like almost hospitalized from going through one of my workouts and that's not good. And then I've had other guys, like there's guys out there that will just crush me in a workout, you know? And especially, you know, there's workouts that I have that I could beat most of the world in. You know, there's workouts that I have that I could crush anybody in end. Then there's workouts that some, you know, Yoga instructor could put me through that would crush me. Right? So my point is that you get some people that I, that would die due to one of my workouts and you get some people that would it be my one of my workouts is no impact because they're an incredible athlete. And so why would either one of them want to do my workout? It's doesn't make any sense that they would want to do that. So what I've been trying to think, cause I get asked all the time, we are, what's your workout? What's your workout? What's your workout? And it's what I've been trying to figure out is how to do this. How do I,

Speaker 1:          01:48:30       how do I communicate what I'm doing and what I've, what I've been kind of going through the idea in my head is putting together a, uh, like an ebook and I actually put this out on Twitter. I was like, Oh yeah, I'll do an ebook. And people like Ebook, Ebook, yeah. Do it, do it. So it's an idea that's already been floated out there. Unfortunate, there's not been a lot of time to be writing ebooks, but what the focus would be would be, yeah, like the types of exercise that I do. Yes. But, and you know, kind of the numbers of that I, that I do have them, but more importantly going to from a leadership perspective is what is the intent? What does the commander's intent of my workout? What am I trying to accomplish? Because for you and me to accomplish the same thing is going to be a dif, very different workout.

Speaker 1:          01:49:21       Right. If, if I want to, if I want to take myself to a, to a, to an anaerobic threshold for a total of 15 minutes, what I would do to get there is very different from what you would do to get there. It just, it just is, if I wanted to destroy my legs with heavy squats, it would be very different between what you would do and what I would do. So what's important is, is not the actual exercises that I'm doing. It's the intent and emi achieving that a tent. It am I achieving that intent. Like I can do a decent amount of pullups. Right. And, and in one of my pull up workouts, I might do 500 pull ups or 300 pull ups. There's a lot of people that can't do a hundred pull ups. So just in the workout, right? Not 300 bullets.

Speaker 1:          01:50:17       Yeah, no, I can't do 300 per pull ups in a row. No. I wish I could, but, but my intent is to, you know, Mack do, do a number of maximum sets of pull ups and then do a number of slow, you know, very good form maximum sets and, and the intent is to get stronger at pull ups by doing, you know, have high number of maximum sets. And I think that intent to give to people would say, okay, so that way if echo's not good at Bob's and you go, okay, well I'm going to go in and I know what the intent is. I'm trying to get to a point of failure even on one single pull up. And it might take you only 15 minutes to do that and 30 pull ups, you know, or whatever the case may be. And for someone that's really good, a rock climber, it might take them, you know, 45 minutes and they might be 600 pullups deep before they get there. And so that's kind of the idea I'm batting around. I don't know if people have that really interested in that. I think a lot of times people want a formula and I don't think I'm going to give out a formula because the formula is going to be different for different people at different times in their lives and ages and body weights and you know, male or female. They're just all so many variables. But I think if I can give out what the intent of my workouts are, then we're in the right place.

Speaker 3:          01:51:44       Yeah. But those, those different variables and stuff that that could very well be the reason that people want your workout. Cause it's this two things, this is probably more than two, but two big things that kind of come along with wanting your specific workout. And one would be just to kind of immerse myself into what you go through in a workout and how does that feel and how do I kind of measure up, you know? Um, and then so those two things, like what does it feel like to do a Jocko workout? Like how she, how hard is it, you know, he's going to do, you know, 600 pull ups in a workout, limited lithy you know, like how does that feel? You know, is that the hardest thing I've ever done or you know, is that just all this, you know, these workouts are, that heart just goes right.

Speaker 3:          01:52:29       That's the second part, does it, you know, how do I measure up if he does, you know, 20 sets of squats with whatever, wait, how do I measure up? Can I get all those 20 sets or can I get that weight for 20 cents? You know, so those two, one, they just want to immerse themselves in your world, in your world as far as workouts go. And the second one is, how do I measure up? I know that's kind of what I think when, when someone's like, Oh, here's, here's our workout, like those crossfit workouts, like some of those just mentally I do that like, okay, this guy's doing 20 pull ups in a row. Like how many can I do? You know, I measurement. And then at the same time, it's like, this is, you get to understand what these crossfitters do

Speaker 3:          01:53:14       can be, you know, and then like I said, they go back and forth that, those two things. And I think that that, that is interesting. Like if you were to tell me what you did this morning for a workout, like I'd be interested on top of the fact that, oh, maybe I want to do that workout for me for results for myself and yet your item, it may or may not, I'll probably have different results even if I do that. The same workout as you for, you know, six months old might have different results. But that part about measuring up and just knowing who you are and kind of what you stand for. And this is the workout that you do. Just understanding that. I think that's significant.

Speaker 1:          01:53:51       Yeah. I would love to tell you that I'm some, you know, physical specimen, but I'm not, I'm actually not the strongest guy. I'm not the fastest guy. I'm not the most flexible guy. Um, I try hard and I also am a result of my, my physical aptitude is like a,

Speaker 2:          01:54:11       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:54:12       is like a, is like a brownish gray, um, paint because I mix up so much stuff in there that I'm the result of,

Speaker 1:          01:54:25       you know, I'm not bright red. Right. I'm not bright blue because those two things, you know, the, the strength has been mixed with endurance, has been mixed with flexibility, has been mixed with all these things had been mixed together. And I don't want to get too much of any of them because then I'm losing something else. And so the, so I'm kind of this, this, this kind of average in many categories and, and my numbers in very few of them, motor impress anybody. You're pretty strong now. Yeah. And, and, and, and, you know, like, but I'm not one of those people that's on the mat that you go, man, that guy is just freaking strong. You know, we'll least, I, it's hard for me to judge, but I know that, uh, I guess people say, Oh, you're strong. Yes. Yeah, I think that, okay. You're like that guy on the, you know, you ever play video games? No.

Speaker 3:          01:55:21       So let's say you play a, I dunno, a football game, you play football, so when you analyze your players, it'll have all these attributes, speed, hands, acceleration. Right. And it's like, I don't know, zero to 10. So you're the guy who has all like eight.

Speaker 1:          01:55:36       Yeah. Instead of the guy with two tens and then a three. But like anybody that's listening this podcast beat me in a bunch of categories. Yeah. You know, they got tens and some stuff. Right, right. Yeah. And, and I don't, I don't have any tenants in anything. That's okay. Not everyone can have tenants. Yeah. Um, next question. Question. Yeah. Um, would you talk more about how you view aggression positive than negative?

Speaker 2:          01:56:10       Well,

Speaker 1:          01:56:13       I like everything in life and in leadership and then your personality, it has to be balanced. Aggression has to be balanced. And you know, one of the, one of the things from, from the book is, you know, you gotta be aggressive but not overbearing. So yeah, you gotta be aggressive. To be a leader, you've got to be there. Because if you're going to make things happen, you've got to be aggressive to make things happen that you, you have to make things happen. You know, I always say to people like, oh, they want to make money. I'm like, well, you use it. Make money. You have to take, you have to take that money. It doesn't get, I got a phone. Your House, lean your lap. It's not going to make itself. You have to take it. If that's what your goal is in Jujitsu, you're, you're not going to get better just by being, you have to take the, the progression.

Speaker 1:          01:57:01       You have to take it and make it happen. And, and that's the same thing with anything in life. So, so aggression definitely comes into play, but for instance, in a leadership position, if you're completely aggressive all the time, your subordinates will not want to communicate with you. They won't want to debate with you. They won't want to say, hey boss, I don't agree with what you're saying here because they're afraid you're gonna go, hey, you don't know what you're talking about. We're going to go my way or the highway. That's what they're going to expect. So you can't be overbearing, you know, on the Mat, you can't exhaust yourself with aggression. And that's one of the things, you know that I think from purple to Brown belt, which is, you know, you're, you're six to eight years in the game is where people start to calm down and realize that that aggression needs to be tampered and control and people have to relax. Um, adding combat, obviously being aggressive and being dis aggressively decisive is important. But if you go too far with that, you're running to your death. So you have to modulate your aggression. You have to modulate your aggression. You can't abuse it. You got to use it, but you can't abuse it.

Speaker 1:          01:58:16       And I don't want to discount aggression in any way because you know, I always say that your default mode should be aggression. Like when you, when you hit the reset button on your brain, you should come out of that reset being aggressive because that, that beat, be aggressive, be proactive, make things happen.

Speaker 2:          01:58:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:58:40       Be on offense,

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       you know, not sitting back and waiting to be attacked or waiting for a situation to occur. No. Make that situation occur. Go. So that's my view of aggression and, and it just has to be balanced. And there's other, or some times where, you know, if you meet aggression with aggression, it's actually not good. You know, you, you see this in Jujitsu, you see this in escalating in when you're either in a confrontation of some kind to somebody aggressively escalating, something might be a good choice. It might be a bad choice. You know, there's always the bully that as soon as you, you say, hey, you know what, I'd love to fight. In fact, fighting is my favorite thing to do. Let's go. I've got it. It's like, no man. Oh, was it? I was just kidding. So aggression will when there, um, or you know, if someone's really being aggressive and you just knock them out, well then that's, that's a better handling of the situation.

Speaker 2:          01:59:39       But there's also times where there's, you know, maybe there's multiple attackers or there's someone that's, you know, you're in the street. It's, it's always better in the street to avoid the confrontation. You know, what does that person have a knife? Does that person have a gay gun? Is does that person have a communicable disease? Does that person have friends around the corner? Is that personal lawyer who's going to sue you? I mean there's all these reasons to get into to to not get into a fight in the street. So, so aggressively meeting aggression with aggression is probably not that smart. It's probably better to avoid the scenario. And, and the more time you spend in, you know, in combat sports boxing and doing Jujitsu them, the more likely you are to be able to be like, you know what, I don't need to prove anything in this guy. I'm, it's, it means nothing to me. I proved myself on the mat every single day. I got nothing to prove to, to Joe drunk idiot over here. So I think that a Gra, again, I think your default mode should be aggressive, but make sure that you maintain enough detachment of the situation that you can see if you're being overly aggressive and it's leading you to a bad scenario. Okay, last question. You talk about mind control. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:00:55       Can you expand your thoughts on that subject?

Speaker 1:          02:01:01       Mind control. You know, when people think of the word mind control, they think of controlling other people's minds. And when I think about mind control, I think about controlling your own mind. Because you know, while I am obviously a physical person and we'd spend a lot of this podcast tonight talking about physical culture and I embrace physicality, but we are our minds and I'm not going to, you know, going, uh, into a Sam Harris Philosophical rant on what it means and where the you actually is and whether there's a soul or a brain or whatever your heart or some other conjured up place. This is what I know is that you, your mind, the thing that is listening and comprehending these words right now, that is you and that thing, that mind you can control you. You are the machine and you can control the machine and people ask me, how do I get tougher? Be Tougher. They, they asked me, how can I wake up earlier in the morning? The answer is wake up earlier in the morning. How can I work out consistently every single day workout consistently every single day? How can I stop from eating sugar? Stop eating sugar. What about the emotions? How can I stop missing that girl or that guy, whoever, whoever broke up with me, how can I stop missing them?

Speaker 1:          02:03:08       Stop missing them.

Speaker 2:          02:03:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:03:13       That is mind control. You have that ability. You just have to assert it. You have to decide that you're going to be in control and that you are going to do what you want to do. Weakness doesn't get a vote. Laziness. They don't get a vote. Sadness, no, no vote. Frustration, no vote. Negativity. You don't get a vote. I don't even give my temper a vote. So the next time that you're feeling weak or you're feeling lazy or you're feeling soft or you're feeling emotional, tell them that they don't get a vote. Tell them you are declaring martial law on your mind. You're declaring mind control and impose what you want on your brain. Impose the discipline and the power and the positivity and the will and use that mind control to move your life where you want it to be is the, I always say get stronger, faster, smarter, quicker, friendlier, more helpful, more driven.

Speaker 2:          02:04:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:04:46       Don't let your mind control you. Control your mind and once you control your mind,

Speaker 2:          02:04:59       then

Speaker 1:          02:05:01       you can set it free. And I think we'll close with that for the day. Yeah, that's about all I've got. I right there. And you know if you're out there and you want to communicate with us, you want to carry on this conversation, you want to continue down this path. You can do so on Twitter.
