Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number one 26 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good evening echo from good evening and tonight also joining us is Mr. David Burke. Good evening Dave. Good evening. On September 27th, 1950 approximately 60 American prisoners who had been confined in prison were taken into the prison yard and groups of 14 with their hands wired together. These men were forced to sit, hunched in, hastily dug ditches and then were shot by North Korean troops at point blank range with American m one rifles using armor piercing ammunition of the two seriously wounded survivors. Only one lived to recount the gruesome details on of civilians estimated at between 5,000 and 7,000 and as well as soldiers of the Republic of Korea or also slaughtered between September 23rd and September 27th, 1950 Sergeant Carrie h y now formally with the 23rd Infantry Regiment. Second Division Korea was the sole survivor of the infamous infamous Tasia on massacre and he testified at a congressional hearing and I'm going to read some of that transcript. Here's sergeant, why now? Toward the last, they was in a hurry to leave Tayshaun to evacuate Tasia on. So they took approximately the last three groups pretty close together. I witnessed the group right in front of me shot.

Speaker 2:          00:01:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:54       After they were shot, we was taken to the ditch and sat down in the ditch and shot. And then Senator Potter asks what happened to you when you were shot?

Speaker 2:          00:02:08       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:02:09       sergeant. Why? L replies, I leaned over against the next man pretending I was done for

Speaker 2:          00:02:15       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:15       In firing. They hit my hand.

Speaker 2:          00:02:18       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:19       Senator Potter. How were you sitting in the ditch? Sergeant. Why now? They was aiming at my head. I have a scar on my neck, one on my collarbone and another in my hand. They hit me three times. And you play dead? Yes sir. After they thought everyone was dead, they started burying us. I came pretty close to getting panicky about that time, but somehow or another, I figured as long as I had some breadth, there was hope. In other words, you were buried alive. That is right, sir. I add in that whole group that I was with, there was not a man that begged for mercy and there was not a man that cracked under the ordeal sergeant. How long were you buried alive? That is hard to say, sir. As I say, I was shot around five o'clock in the morning and I stayed in the ditch until that evening until what time? It was dark. I would say approximately eight hours. Seven or eight hours. Now that is from a report on Korean War atrocities written by the subcommittee on Korean War investigations. And I want to repeat one line again from sergeant. Why now? He says in that whole group that I was with, there was not a man that begged for mercy and there was not a man that cracked under the ordeal.

Speaker 1:          00:04:05       So think about that. Think about the will and the discipline of those men to be facing certain death at the hands of the murderous enemy, but to face death with solve them silence and show no signs of breaking. And I've said before that war brings out the worst in people, but it also brings out the best and that is but one of thousands upon thousands of examples of the dedication of our military fighting men. And I'm going to read you another example from the same bor around the same time, but this one is an award citation and it reads, the president of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the silver star to first lieutenant armor, Thomas Wilford Fife United States army for Gallantry in action as a member of company B 72nd tank battalion, Second Infantry Division in action against an armed enemy on 19 September, 1950 in the vicinity of young saying Korea. On that date, Lieutenant Phife was in command of a platoon of tanks charged with the support of infantry elements. In the defense of young saying perimeter, the enemy attacked his position with superior numbers and a fanatic determination to penetrate through to the division main supply route.

Speaker 1:          00:05:48       The enemy attack was successful in routing the friendly elements and inflicting casualties to the extent that the organization and combat effectiveness of the positions was completely disrupted. Realizing the seriousness of the situation, Lieutenant Fife disregarded the heavy enemy, fire and dismounted from the protective armor of his tank to reorganize the foot elements. After reorganization, he remained on the ground and successfully reestablished the positions by controlling both the foot elements and his tanks by means of radio communications. During this same date, while engaged in a friendly attack against the enemy, lieutenant fife again displayed gallantry by refusing evacuation. After being wounded, the leadership, loyalty and gallon actions demonstrated that day by lieutenant fife are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service. So Lieutenant Phife was under attack from devastating enemy fire, but he did not remain in the protection of his tank. In fact, he did the opposite. He exited his tank to organize troops and stop the enemy attack. He risked his life to lead his men.

Speaker 1:          00:07:11       Then he would continue to lead even after wounded. Now, Korea was not the first war for Lieutenant Tom Fife, nor would it be his last lieutenant fife had actually already fought in World War II. He fought in Korea and he fought in Vietnam. He also received three Purple Hearts for each of the three times he was wounded once in each war and in addition to the silver star from Korea, he also received another silver star for his service in Vietnam and a Legion of Merit and a distinguished flying cross and survived all that and served our great nation for 25 years. And I will say that it is my absolute honor to have retired Colonel Thomas Fife on the podcast today.

Speaker 3:          00:08:15       Sir, thank you for coming on. It's nice to be here. I think I listen to that story. It brought back gears. Quite frankly, I'm upset just because of the memory of that. It was a horrible experience, but one that had to get done and I still remember getting out of that tank and wondering why in the hell I was doing it. But something had to done. When you see thousands of people coming at you and you have nothing but your weapons and the guys needed some help. They just, they were willing to I guess, run. I don't know what that was, what they were, they needed leadership and that's the only thing I could think of to get out and try to be there with them. And thank God we turned them around and we were able to stop the enemy.

Speaker 4:          00:09:35       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:09:35       you can't understand what it's like to be there and having thousands of people compression at you in the best you can do is shoot your tank guns and machine guns. And he just kept coming and she just kept coming. I mean, talk about discipline is, those guys were disciplined too. And uh, we had to get our guys together and we did. And it was, I think I was lucky. I was damn lucky by the way. My wounds weren't dead serious. I got shot in the ass and it closed up. The wound closed up and so it stopped bleeding. And for all practical purposes, I was as good as new for a while. So, I mean, it wasn't that serious a wound. I mean, I, I'd hope to be evacuated to Japan but didn't work. So, so your million dollar wound turned out to be like a 50 cent was again, at least it was, it was, uh, you know, you, when you, when I got wounded, I felt the blood rush into my pants and then it stopped.

Speaker 3:          00:10:58       So why not keep going so far as that's concerned? The wound was debt over it. And when I finally got to the Mash Hospital, the doctor said, that's when we can do for you. It's going to work. It's way out or stay there forever. It eventually worked his way out, which is how I have ended up being evacuated when we were up in North Korea and, uh, got to a hospital ship, Navy hospital ship, and they took the piece of metal out of my butt. And then MacArthur just said, general MacArthur had said, we're going to be home by thinks by Christmas. So my objective is get off that hospital ship as fast. I couldn't get back to my unit. And of course the Chinese hit. Yeah. And so I was now trying to get back to my unit in the army was totally screw it up. We didn't know where, who was. So I ended up to be young Yang Gland in and [inaudible] the capital of North Korea and the airfield was totally surrounded by fire. We were destroying all of our equipment and whatever else. We I our plane, the plane landed and I had to go find my unit.

Speaker 3:          00:12:39       Nobody knew where it was. So I got on the road and started hitchhiking. Yeah. That's the guy who came along who happened to be a classmate of mine who was in Salem car. He stopped, saw me pick me up, don't we backed him where he was, which was core headquarters and they didn't know where and how am I afraid it was. So finally he told me back to the mash hospital, another mash hospital and the Mash Hospital knew where my unit was and they took me back to my inner in an ambulance. I wasn't wounded. Just a way to convey, get me back to my unit. I still remember those days. Terrible experience, but fun.

Speaker 5:          00:13:30       It's hard for people to understand that. Again, I have that discussion with people a lot when you're saying, hey, this was the worst time of my life and also the best time of my life. At the same time, let's, uh, let's, I mean we'll, let's get into Korea, but let's talk a little bit about sort of where you came from, how you grew up. Um, starting with, uh, I guess Sioux City, Iowa.

Speaker 3:          00:13:54       That's right. Well, I was a kid growing up in the middle of the United States. Uh, I was reminded on the way over here, I wish talking when Pearl Harbor happened, I was 16 or almost 16 years old. I was in a movie theater and they staffed the movie and he announced that Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor.

Speaker 3:          00:14:32       I didn't know where Pearl Harbor was. Now I knew where the Hawaiian islands where, but I didn't know Pearl Harbor was in the Hawaiian islands. You'll, when you're an Iowa v, there's no oceans. Nobody, not nobody. You don't think about oceans. And so here we were in this movie and I was almost 16 as I said, and I said, Oh hell, the world be over before I ever get called in. Well, that turned out to be wrong. So, uh, as I said, I was going through high school. My whole objective, why was in high school, it's going to become a chemical engineer and go to Cornell University. Why? Because my best friend's oldest brother-in-law was, was a chemical engineer working in Sumatra. What may you grown up on? Io Sumatra sound like a pretty good thing to be doing. So I asked who I wanted to be a chemical engineer and I was going to go to Cornell because he went to Cornell and that was going to be what I was going to do.

Speaker 3:          00:15:49       Well, the war happened and I suddenly became 18 and you get drafted. It's hard for people to realize today, every place you go, people who are in uniform, when people walking around in civilian clothes, the only people who were in civilian clothes or those who couldn't qualify because of physical disabilities. So everybody was in uniform no matter where you weren't. So I got drafted and fortunately my dad was smart enough to send me off to Iowa state before I was 18 and I got two quarters in as an engineer. So the army has great wisdom, decided to debate me, accommodate engineer, which was a hell of a lot better than being an infant. But as far as I was concerned. So I went to Fort Jackson, South Carolina.

Speaker 3:          00:16:55       Now when you're from Sioux City, Iowa, Columbia, South Carolina is eons away. It took us five days on a damn train to get there. So we got there in all of us soldiers get off the train. And this first sergeant got us all lined up there and uh, he's calling role and he says Fifi and I l five. And from that moment on, I was Fifi. And so anyway, the, that was in March of 1944 44. And so we went to basic training. It learned to be a competent engineer. And I became a demolition specialists. Now it's hard for people to realize, here's a kid who grows up in Sioux city, Iowa and suddenly is handling explosives. I had no more idea of doing that in a man in the moon. So in the training, we were primarily learning to build bridges and take care of roads. That was our primary mission.

Speaker 3:          00:18:29       But we're also, we're taught to be instrument combat engineers have a secondary responsibility. And so we, uh, ended up, uh, fortunately going to Europe when we were in training, we had no idea which direction we were going to go. But in retrospect, I've always felt that we were lucky to go to Europe rather than to the southeast. However, uh, when I got to Europe, it was colder than hell. I wasn't so sure that was a really big decision, but it worked out all right. But, uh, but our primary role was to go to Europe and become, uh, take care of the roads and, uh, all the things that engineers do. It's a, you showed up there is where you write it around the, the battle, the bolts timeframe. Yes. I mean the bad, the bulge was as I remember right around Christmas time of 1944, 44.

Speaker 3:          00:19:45       Yeah. And we got to the continent right at that time. But I unit went to Luxembourg. Uh, it primarily was helping General Patton's army turn, make a 90 degree turn and go north to help stop the Germans. And so the roads had to be taken care of and, and that's what our unit was doing. So we prime during the, the actual combat have best Tom. We were working on roads and keeping the roads open for the, uh, Patton's army to get up there. Uh, our unit eventually, uh, eliminated the Germans, the last Germans from Luxembourg in the little town called [inaudible], which is on the Yarra river right across from the Sig free border for a secret line. And, uh, so the 1250 fifth engineer combat battalion turned in an infantry outfit for brief, very time. February 12th, 1945, we got rid of all the Germans, glass Germans in its country of Luxembourg,

Speaker 5:          00:21:21       combat engineers. We always, I always have to, we'll always want to give them their due because they continue to keep roads open. And when, when when we were fighting in Ramadi was the combat engineers primarily that they had the duty of of mine clearance and it was a brutal and date, I mean obviously a highly dangerous job for them to be out there clearing those minds and keeping those roads open. That's a, it's a hell of a job.

Speaker 3:          00:21:43       Well, as a demolition specialists, one of my other, one of my jobs was mine, Clarence and I was operating a mine sweeper on this road down into the valley at the end and and behind me where the were two tanks from the calvary unit and the Germans could see the tanks. I guess they could see us too, but they sure the hell was, she could looking at the tanks and shooting at the tanks and a lot of their machine gun fire wood ricocheted off the tanks and that's how I got hit with ricochet off the damn tank. Got into my leg and arm. But superficially, I mean all I just go back to age station, get bandaged up and back into my unit. It wasn't, wasn't any a hospitalization at all, that kind of stuff. Another 50 cent wound for it. Exactly. I'd be, I had a lot of those.

Speaker 5:          00:22:55       So how long were you, so did you stay over over in Europe until the war ended?

Speaker 3:          00:23:00       No, I actually, actually in March, uh, the unit got orders for me to return to the United States because I had appointments in the United States military academy. And so my very first airplane ride was from Lee Age, Belgium to Paris. And I was, I remember going into this office in Paris and I was dressed in my battle gear, so to speak, and they'd looked at me and he said, and I had, it's still over the where I was still wearing my steel helmet and the, and the, I can still remember this is sergeant scene. We've got to take care of this guy. We got to dress him. And so they put me in all brand new clothes. Two days later, I was on an airplane flying back to United States. 27 hours later in five stops in route. We ended up in Washington DC. So, and so I ended up my first time it ever visit to Pentagon. Here's this 19 year old PFC dressed in brand new clothes, walking into the Pentagon. And I can tell you, I wasn't sure what the hell I was doing when I finally got orders to go to Cornell University, Cornell University, but for to get re academic, uh, get reoriented towards academics.

Speaker 5:          00:24:46       So wait, so you had orders to west point, but they were going to send you to Cornell for a little while to prepare for it?

Speaker 3:          00:24:51       Well, no, I had an appointment to the academy. Okay. If you had an appointment as academy, in fact, this is still true today. If you're having an appointment of the academy, they've take you out of combat and bring you back some place safe. And what they brought us back. There was about 300 of us at Cornell, all uh, from different parts of the service, whether it be army, air force, back downstairs. It was US army, air corps, and uh, we were there for them to get re

Speaker 5:          00:25:37       acclimated to the academia. Turn your brain back on. Yeah. Thank you. And so that was, at this point, did you know, did you know you wanted to stay in the army as a career? Had you enjoyed your time in Europe? And he said, you know what, I think I'm going to do think them to go the distance or no,

Speaker 3:          00:25:56       I had no, I had no idea. It wasn't until after. Well, very quickly my appointment to the academy was an alternate appointment and is the principal, if he qualifies, the alternate doesn't get to go in. My principal qualified. So now where they do with me in the earliest great, infinite wisdom decided to send me to officer candidate school. So they sent me down to Fort Belvoir to the engineer officer Candy School. The army knew they're going to need a lot of second lieutenants over in the Southeast Asia. And so anyway, in the middle of officer candidate school and warrant Japan ended. Now what? Well, they stopped officer caddies based, slow it down I guess is the right word. And, but I continued on in, graduated, uh, into January of 1945 and here I wasn't out to set lieutenant. So you've got your commission. Yeah, and I had an and I, and now I also had a principal appointment to the military academy, so whether they do it, so they kept me at Fort Belvoir training recruits. And then in July they discharged me from the army to enter the military academy as a cadet. And July 1st, 1946 it was somewhere in there

Speaker 4:          00:27:39       that

Speaker 3:          00:27:41       I started to like the army.

Speaker 4:          00:27:43       Got It.

Speaker 3:          00:27:45       But I knew if I wanted to be an engineer, I damn well had to get a college education. Well, we're better to go, going to placements, supposed to train you to be an army engineer, which is this case west point. So I could, I went onto west wine and spent four years there obviously, and graduated in 1950.

Speaker 5:          00:28:09       So you got commissioned, they took your king mission away for four years. He got, and then they give it back to you at the end of 40 days.

Speaker 3:          00:28:16       We only rank I've ever had was in the army with twice my second lieutenant. Yes, that's right.

Speaker 5:          00:28:23       Eh, sir. In West Point at this point is being run by just all World War II veterans of I'm sure.

Speaker 3:          00:28:30       Yes. In fact, a r e m

Speaker 3:          00:28:37       our tactical officers who were all lieutenant colonels who had been battalion commanders of some short in World War II in Europe or in the air force, tactical tactical officer of my company. The first two years was an artilleryman. And the second two years was, uh, uh, uh, air force. Well, it was US Army Air Corps became the air force, uh, lieutenant colonel. So it ended, the superintendent was a Maxwell Taylor and a common dant was guiding the Paulding Harkins who was colonel hearkens. He was a gentle patents, a hatchet man. And uh, and the deputy commandant was a guy. But John Kay waters who was a general patent sending law. So, uh, so they were all when

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       World War II veterans. Yes. And, and as were you at the time that had to be, was that fairly unique or was there a lot of other guys that were prior enlisted that were coming to west point? Um,

Speaker 3:          00:29:57       uh, my class who started about 1100 of us, uh, I would guess several hundred were veterans of some sort. Uh, Navy Army, army, air corps. Uh, yes. I would say about two or 200. 200 to 300. I don't remember exactly. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:30:24       Now when you're going through west point, the war ends, are you, is his war on the horizon for you or did you guys have an attitude kind of like, well, you know, we're going to go and be peace time army officers for the next however many years? Or did you see trouble brewing?

Speaker 3:          00:30:43       No, John, no trouble brewing. I mean, I don't think anybody really herself what was going to happen? Korea, uh, in fact t z, the only thing that was trouble if he would was the Berlin airlift happened. While we were it could it. And so he saw that kind of thing. But I guess in maybe in our naivety, we figured that nobody was going to pull the plug and really have the Russians attack or vice versa, where we're going to do anything. Uh,

Speaker 5:          00:31:24       see. So when you graduate, what's your next move? What was your next move after you graduated?

Speaker 3:          00:31:31       Well, it wasn't my move. North Korea invaded South Korea and here generally present Predator prey. President Truman decided to send to US troops to Korea. Now one of the things when you, when you graduate a buy order rank, you're allowed to choose your branch and then where you want to go. Well, my experience was being in front of that tank and getting shrapnel, I decided I didn't want to be out in front of the tank. I wanted to be in the tank. So I chose, I chose not to be an engineer's again. I chose to go into the armor. So I chose to go to once again, uh, grown up on Iowa state of Washington was somewhere, who knows where. So I chose Fort Lewis, Washington. There's a place I'd want to go visit. So that's my first post was to go to Fort Lewis, Washington. Did it turned out to be the 29th, 29th? No, the 70 shagging tank battalion, which was part of the Second Infantry Division. President Truman, while I was on my honeymoon in Canada, decided to send a second division off to Korea. So in my infinite wisdom, not knowing just what happening, well, I was in Canada and I called home to wish my mother and Dad Happy 4th of July.

Speaker 4:          00:33:27       Oh,

Speaker 3:          00:33:28       G army had shin, a telegram to my parents' house. Shane for me, get my ass for real estate as soon as possible. Well, I'm halfway there when I'm up in Alberta, Canada. So we drive off to Fort Lewis. And so I arrived at Fort Lewis, uh, middle of July. Now you got to, I'm now a tank platoon leader. Never been in a tank before. Let me tell you actually an experience. Most people don't want to have. I, the only thing I had going, by the way, many years later, my platoon sergeant told me, he said at that time he was my gunner. He said, we've fairly, really fortunate. We had a guy who had been in combat in World War Two not knowing that I didn't know a damn thing about a tank, but the good news is the sergeant was smart enough to teach me how to be somewhat of a tanker

Speaker 5:          00:34:47       on the ship on the way over to Korea. So you had no, you, you showed up. You were, you get done with your, or you cut short your honeymoon, you go straight to Fort Lewis and then you immediately glowed up.

Speaker 3:          00:35:01       Yes. My first tank right west from the port, not from the motor pool at Fort Lewis to the port of Olympia to put the tank on the ship and goodbye. That was my first tank.

Speaker 5:          00:35:15       Correct. Yeah. That's the point you made about, you know, not just that you're, you're sergeant was smart enough to teach you, but equally important is that you are smart enough to listen and we get all kinds of young officers and I'm sure you saw him through the years that they're not smart enough to listen to the people that have the experience. And, and that's a huge lesson learned yet seems to always need to get learned by,

Speaker 6:          00:35:38       I wish I've told more people when asked, what do you do to be successful? I say listen to your sergeants, listened to your sergeants, asks them, don't be afraid to ask because I'll tell you their job is to make you successful. And unfortunately there are too many people who don't have egos that can allow them to do that.

Speaker 5:          00:36:07       No doubt about it. They think it's going to make them look bad when it actually yes, it actually elevates them in the eyes of the sergeant. Yeah. And Yup. So your trip overseas, you're on the ship and you show up in Korea. Yes.

Speaker 6:          00:36:27       You can't understand what it's like to be several miles off shore and begin to smell what's going to be turned out to beads. Puerto Busan where you could smell it before he ever got there and we knew we were pulling into and hadn't never, I've never been to that part of the world and my whole life and we offloaded ourselves from the troop ship, waited for our tanks to come on the, on the other ships and we spent four days in in Pusan waiting for the equipment to come and then offloading it and getting it ready to go into battle.

Speaker 5:          00:37:16       Then at what point this is, this is like the battle of [inaudible]. This is the Pusan perimeter and this is the beginning of it right now. This is for those of you that don't know, this is North Korean troops coming down, 100,000 North Korean troops coming down and have you guys basically squeezed on to, it's almost a peninsula. It's like a little not have land that sticks out.

Speaker 6:          00:37:40       35 miles radius from the shitty of who Sean was, the Pusan perimeter. That was the last character he held. Everything else was held by the North Koreans.

Speaker 5:          00:37:52       It's so when you landed there, that's the situation they were in. Yes. And how did you guys, and how did you and your troops feel about that?

Speaker 6:          00:38:06       I don't think we were even cognitive. How serious it was after we loaded a tanks onto the rail cars. She go to the rail, head of marrying would just, I don't know, the 20 miles, 25 miles from Busan where we offloaded the tanks. He said where I first went into combat in Korea.

Speaker 3:          00:38:37       Eh, I don't really know that. We thought how serious it was. It got you. I got the impression several days later when the division assistant division commander called all the hospitals in the singer NGLs together in a, in a place and he's dead men. We live or die here. And I've thought to myself, what in the hell did I get myself into here? Yeah. But that's, that's what it was. I mean, we would, I it, you know, in hindsight, yeah. I have read books about what happened in Korea and we really didn't understand that. I mean we were just there doing a job and uh, I don't think we really understood how perilous the situation was.

Speaker 5:          00:39:40       And at any point while you were there, did you understand the peril of the situation to, or would you just in your particular battles day by day trying to hold the line where you were at? Didn't it? Was the communications is kind of not effective enough to really for you to understand the bigger picture? We,

Speaker 3:          00:39:59       we had no idea what the bigger picture was. I mean honest to God, we were just doing our job and as I said earlier, watching these waves of people come across it. Yeah. Knack. John River will never ever go away from my memory. I mean people were just coming, coming, coming and all we were doing, it was shooting, shooting, shooting and neighbor just keep coming and uh,

Speaker 2:          00:40:33       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:40:33       we managed to hold the line and they didn't penetrate. So No, the answer is we didn't understand this as a situation as your,

Speaker 5:          00:40:51       were you holding the line specifically you guys, you are holding the line on that river. Yes. And so they were going to have to try and cross that river to get through the line. When they swimming. Where are they taking boats with? What were they doing? They were waiting.

Speaker 3:          00:41:04       It was, it wasn't that, it wasn't it, it was pretty wide river, but it wasn't that deep. So they were able to wade across, uh, yeah. And they'd be just keep coming. I mean,

Speaker 5:          00:41:18       and then how long, how long did that particular, how long were you under intense waves of attacks like that? It was like a tone. Was it like 20 days or something of the whole, the whole thing I think lasted, I dunno, 20 days or something. That was, was going to say,

Speaker 3:          00:41:36       I, I don't know, it seemed like forever, but I think it was probably over and two or three, a couple of weeks. Uh, my first involvement, we've got off the tanks off the flat car and then we rolled into action and my, uh, uh, lead tank right in front of my very eyes exploded.

Speaker 3:          00:42:20       We'll never forget watching the tank commander go sailing out into the ditch to the right and the tank exploding. We are rounded a curve and unbeknownst to us, never to Russian tanks, man by Koreans up just draw. And they fired at this tank and we had him, my Virginia was in force, uh, Sherman tanks and gas engines and they fired him. They fired into the gas tank is Hillel thing exploded. And so my first day in Korea combat one tank destroyed fire people, which at that time tank had a crew of five or all four of them were killed in the tank to tank commander. It was back in the United States. And less than two weeks after we left over three weeks after we left. And that was my first day in combat in Korea. And uh, so from then on we got into the, the perimeter and spent a couple of weeks there. I don't know. I don't, I don't remember. Uh, you read earlier by the citation, it was September 19th, which when I was one of the reason, I know that was September 19th. So if, because you, what you read, I didn't remember what exact data dates it was. Yeah. Cause it wasn't too long after that happened that we had to Inchon landing and everything broke out and we were heading north. So it was a couple of weeks. I don't know.

Speaker 5:          00:44:20       When you were from a leadership perspective dealing with losing guys in comparison to when you were in World War II and you weren't necessarily in command of, but you're seeing people get wounded, you're seeing people get killed. What was your mindset? What was your perspective? Um, as a leader when guys were getting wounded, guys were getting killed and then you had a bunch of, you know, you were saying that your sergeant, you, they felt they were lucky to have someone that had been in combat before and then all of a sudden I know that they were looking to you saying, okay, well what do we do now, boss?

Speaker 6:          00:44:56       Yeah. Well one thing about, uh, in a tank, the grooves are inside the tank and as with the radio you could direct people to do this and do that. Uh, and so I just told them what they should be doing and they did it. I mean, I didn't, uh, leadership is just telling people what they should do and they're trained to do it and they do it. I mean, uh, I, I learned, actually I learned, I talked to a grownup on Iowa leadership. I didn't even know what that was. I learned what leadership was all about at West Point. And that's the major difference. When I was in World War Two, I was just taking care of myself. I wasn't really too concerned about the other guy, what was going on. We were all just doing our job. That's very different when you're in a combat situation. Uh, and you got people depending on each other. And we were all dependent upon each other when we're in a tank platoon and each of us were trained to do a job and they did it. I mean, one of the, one of the things my petunias

Speaker 6:          00:46:44       didn't exist prior, I mean, on paper it existed. It didn't exist physically. So what happened when we were activated, the guard house was emptied out and we got replacements from Fort Hood, Texas. And that was my platoon. One of the best soldiers in my platoon was my loader who had spent most of his army career in the guard house. But you can't believe what a great soldier wasn't. Combat. I mean, cause he knew what he was doing and he was trained to do it and he did it. I will never forget those young men. I mean, I'm still in

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       email contact with my former gunner, who's now retired as a command sergeant major, but he still calls me lieutenant does. He was, he kept my ass on a trouble, I'll tell you that. Right? I mean he, he taught me more about how to be a platoon leader than anybody will ever understand. And I guess the leadership training I had at west point combined with what these young member teaching me allowed me to become pretty effective. A leader throughout, not just my military career, but my commercial career too. I, I, I'm a strong believer in that leadership works not just in the military but in commercial business.

Speaker 5:          00:48:31       Yeah. You talked about leadership inside a tank. What did you see in and how did you see what was going on that got you to get out of that tank and tell you that you needed to get out of that vehicle and start driving

Speaker 3:          00:48:43       and what's going on in the ground? I wish I knew the answer to that. I mean it just did it. I made, I knew something had to be done and my radio communications with these guys on the ground wasn't working. So you've got to, you got to communicate. And the only way you can communicate if the radio isn't working, you've got to get your butt off the, off the tank down there so you can talk to these guys because they weren't trying to talk to me. I was trying to talk to them and get them figuring out what the hell they should be doing. So I just did it. I don't know what prompted me to do it. It's a good question

Speaker 5:          00:49:35       cause I have no idea. You know, I talk about that sometimes I talk about, uh, as a leader, being able to identify what I would call it. I just called the void of leadership and it's very easy to see when you are used to seeing leadership filling the void. When you see a void of leadership, if you're aware to look for it, it's really easy to see when it's there and you go, wait a second, someone needs to step in here and take charge. And so you had that instinct of hey, there's a void of leadership here. I got to do something and here we go. That's right. As much as you said to yourself at one point I'm going to be inside that tank and then the damn time you needed the tank you got out of it.

Speaker 3:          00:50:18       Well in hindsight he had to do what you had to do, I will say.

Speaker 5:          00:50:23       And then when, what, once you guys held the line and you, it's funny because I use that expression a lot just talking about, you know, a holding your line with your personal discipline and holding the line with your, your subordinates. And we use it metaphorically. And it's incredible to see here and talk to you about actually literally holding the line when you guys got done holding the line and you had defeated that, that onslaught from, from the North Koreans. What was the next phase?

Speaker 3:          00:50:59       Move out and move north. And we, the first weeks we moved four or five miles at the most [inaudible] we moved hundreds of miles and I remember going as fast as we could north to marry up with the guys who invaded it inches. And we just kept going. I mean,

Speaker 3:          00:51:37       I, I don't remember how many opportunities we had to really get into combat. Uh, after we cleared the Pusan perimeter until after we got Dorth of sill. I mean, we, uh, the invading army, the invasion force, uh, invaded it pretty well, cleared all that stuff away. And so the city of Seoul was open when we, we went right through it and we kept going north. Uh, the enemy was retreating pretty fast and we were just going as fast as we could drive enough to roads in the, uh, in fact, uh, our unit got almost the Yellow River, uh, which is what about the time they decided the take the, take the staff out of my butt. So I was sent back to the hospital ship and in the heart

Speaker 5:          00:52:47       that's when you got shrapnel was when you were up by the, by the Yalu River? No, no. That's all that had already. That's right. That had happened earlier and now it's coming back.

Speaker 3:          00:52:56       The staff was working, no. One of the things you got to remember is this piece of metal is in my, but now in a tank, the tank commander sits, has a little thing, just cities, but on while he's riding around in the turret, well you don't do that when you have a piece of metal working his way out. It is painful to say the least. And so I couldn't hardly wait for that to happen, but they wouldn't let me go back to the hospital until it got reasonably close to the surface. So when it got close to the surface, they evacuated me and it was in November of 1950 that they sent me back to the hospital ship.

Speaker 5:          00:53:46       And then, then I think you covered this, but then you got done, the metal comes out and then you go back again cause you're trying to, you're thinking here to get home by Christmas if you can get back to your unit.

Speaker 3:          00:53:57       And I, I got back to the unit eventually, but I didn't get home by Chrysalis. In fact, they, uh, by that, by the time I got back to the unit, we were the second division. It had already moved back south, uh, almost to the, um, the Han River. And so I've, I've found the unit again somewhere south of somewhat north of the Han River, but still we were still in North Korea, but it was the south part of North Korea.

Speaker 5:          00:54:33       And were you in a situ? W did you guys get dug in? Because I know part of the Korean War was like, they dug in and it was almost like trench warfare. Did you enter that phase or were you still guys still moving north and south? Yep,

Speaker 3:          00:54:45       we do. Uh, as tanks we never dug in. Now later on, uh, hang tin line stabilize pretty much around the 38th parallel and there's a lot of digging in a defensive positions as well. Uh, but that was more infantry, not not the tanks.

Speaker 5:          00:55:12       So how did you, how did you end up, what was the, what was the last phase of you being over there like and, and what ended up bringing you back to the states?

Speaker 3:          00:55:21       Uh, well,

Speaker 3:          00:55:27       the line sort of stabilized around the 38th parallel that we would go forward and then we come back. We would go forward, come back, uh, oftentimes, uh, the, we would do patrolling I guess is the right word, patrolling and forced a tank company with an f to company attached ratting on the tanks would blast forward, uh, to some enemy position, uh, it into a firefight, take the ground, and then we'd move back again. We were just going back and forth, uh, around that so-called, uh, uh, now turned out to be the 38th parallel. But it was generally that sector. Uh, uh, oftentimes the infantry would get into a lot more heavy firefights and the tanks would, uh, I spent a lot of time supporting infantry. Uh, tax was my tank guns, machine guns covering their advancements forward. But uh, dug in, no, we never, their tanks for never dug in.

Speaker 5:          00:57:02       And then how long did that last? For what, how long did you, was your unit deployed over there and wasn't the whole unit that, that ended up going home?

Speaker 3:          00:57:08       No, no, at, uh, at a certain point decided at people who had been there a year would come home and we started a rotation and, uh, I was one of the first ones to rotate out of my unit because I had some decorations and because I'd been there a year and et Cetera, I had a lot of points. And so, uh, I was sent back, I guess, uh, I got back to the United States Labor Day of 1951, so I was evacuated. The word evacuated is probably not the right word. We just shipped back home. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:58:04       And then so you get back home, you know where you are coming home from Korea, it's obviously you at least experienced some pretty intense stuff. And you know, you hear a lot of times, especially nowadays with guys coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan with guys struggling to readapt to,

Speaker 5:          00:58:23       to life back in America. And I think it's a little bit different because when you came home you were still in the army. And I think that's the best thing for veterans. You know, if you're still in, I think the veterans that have the hardest time are veterans that get out and then all of a sudden the Brotherhood that they are used to is gone. And the mission that they're used to is gone. But is that, is that what you experienced and you came home and you, you still had your mission of moving forward in the army?

Speaker 3:          00:58:48       Yes. I mean, I had no feeling of not being appreciated. I mean, uh, obviously I, uh, when I came back, I came back, uh, uh, I had a daughter born while I was in Korea, scaring the hell out of me. I mean, I, I would have, I still remember this four month old child I held for the first time, first time I've ever held any buddy that size scared the hell out of me. It would be, I was more scared about death and a lot of the things to happen to me. But anyway, I came back, went to Fort Knox, uh, when they sent me now they sent me to school, learn to be a platoon leader. And so, and then they, uh, asked me if I wanted to stay there at Fort Knox and run an officer, candy company. And I did. And so we spent several years running and Asta Candy Company and then, uh, they decided they didn't need it any more officer candidate school at Fort Knox. So they closed that down. And I got selected to be an aid to a John Waters. John Waters does with General Patton's son in law and a wonderful experience. Learned a lot from a real gentleman. Uh, he was, uh, he, he, he was a bigger general that time became, say two stars, but he eventually retired as a four star general. And, uh, but he taught me a lot about being a, being an officer. Uh, that's much about leadership, but being an officer and a gentleman, he was a outstanding person. And, uh, I learned from him.

Speaker 4:          01:01:08       I mean,

Speaker 3:          01:01:10       you know, when you, when you're working as an aide, you get pretty close to somebody and, uh, uh, always feel very fortunate that I was able to be his aid and learn. I don't know if you know, he's the one in the movie, but General Patents and then, uh, uh, troops into rescue somebody in a prisoner of war camp. He was the one who was into prisoner of war camp and he was wounded very seriously there. But I mean, and uh, it was quite a experience working for him for several years. That was multiple years, pardon? Multiple years as an aide. I vent a two and a half years has, is eight. So, and then as he went on to his assignments, I went onto my assignments and, uh, one of the experiences I had, uh, in 1956, 56, I was a company commander, a chain

Speaker 6:          01:02:20       company, and [inaudible] Germany said, yeah. And he at that time was running the military assistance command in Yugoslavia and he decided to come up and visit me. Now here's the major general, and he's coming to visit this captain and bomb holder Germany. And it was, you can't believe all the other stuff that went on, what the hell's he general coming to see you for it, et Cetera, et cetera. But anyway, we, we got through all that. But, uh, he, he was, uh, he didn't come to visit me in Vietnam when he was Pacific commander, but, uh, he was, uh, he took care of watching what I was doing. So it was, it was an experience, wonderful experience and a great learning experience to be his aid.

Speaker 5:          01:03:20       Yeah. I was actually an aid to, for the admiral that was in charge of all the seals and it was a very similar situation for me. It was a great guy. And I learned aton about, about the way the whole big machine work, which you have no idea when you're a young Hulu Danny, you have no idea what's going on behind the scenes. And, and I definitely got to learn a lot about that. And the same thing you just talked about, you know, I had just had a great relationship with them and, and uh, he took care of me and my guys on many occasions, uh, which was great. And since he was the admiral at one time we were, he was a surfer and I was organizing a trip for us to go to Hawaii and we were going to see some of the seals that were stationed out in Hawaii. And the big thing I had to do is get organized so that when we got picked up at the airport, there were surfboards in the vehicles ready to take us directly to surfing. As soon as we showed up the safe no, people say, what do you want these sexy, you just get the surf boards ready. That's what you need to do for the boss. Um, and then, so you did that, you end up, you end up, so 56, you're over, you're a company commander. And what happens in between then and,

Speaker 6:          01:04:37       and then, uh, I was, um, a unit, second harmed second armored division and at that time, um, and 57, uh, they had something they were going to rotate the fourth division, which Fourth Armored Division, which I had been at Fort Hood. They rotate it to Germany in the second armored division to go to rotate back to port hood. However, I'd only been in country a little over a year and I wasn't eligible to rotate back. So they

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       uh, uh, in her decision for those of us who weren't eligible, had to be reassigned. And I was reassigned to be at the secretary of the general staff. It Heidelberg, which is US Army Europe. So non going from being a company commander in bomb holder Germany, which is the end of the line, all the way to the very senior army command in Europe. And I'm working now for a four star general in his general staff organization. And I had, uh, once again a chance to go from learning, knowing what's going on down here to watching what's going on, very senior leadership. And, uh, it was, it another opportunity, uh, for a year and a half. I had that job and it was just a great experience learning if you would the other extreme of where you'd been. That was my, and then rotated back to the United States and 59 to become a math professor. It was point would I spent four years being a math professor and then went to the Army Command General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth. And then the army decided that they needed to have people contracting McNamara's Whiz kids in. So they figured that somebody had been teaching math, probably could not. So they sent me the University of Michigan to get a degree in,

Speaker 3:          01:07:19       which turned out to be operations research. But the army sent me to be, get a degree in automatic data processing, which they didn't have such a thing at Michigan. But uh, Eh, closest thing to it was industrial engineering operations research. So I spent two years there getting a degree. And then I rather than go back to the Pentagon for utilization tour, I volunteered to go to Vietnam. So I, and uh,

Speaker 5:          01:07:51       when you say that they will, the army knew that they needed someone to counteract the whiz kids. And I've talked about the Whiz kids at, I've covered them somewhat because the, a lot of the people operational on the ground said, hey, these, these statistics that you're coming up with don't take into account the human aspect of these kind of, this conflict in Vietnam. So was that something that was felt and, and understood inside the army at that time? I mean, clearly it was,

Speaker 6:          01:08:19       yes. That's the whole idea was to take somebody who knew something about the army and give him some education to these kids. So called kids had, uh, and statistical analysis and all that stuff. And so to be the other part of the, of the, of the board, and that was to be my utilization tour. So

Speaker 5:          01:08:49       there's a great example of that and it's, it's the battle. The, I drank valley and um, Colonel Moore talks about it, the fact that the, what the whiz kids basically said, well one of the things that they said was, okay, we can kill 170, uh, Vietnamese soldiers for every one of ours that, that they kill. So statistically we'll just keep running that problem over and over again and we'll end up winning. And I always point out and which, which everyone points out, and I'm sure you had pointed out as well as what they didn't take into account is the fact that number one, 170 Vietnamese killed to the Vietnamese was not as big of a deal as we thought it would be. And we also didn't take into account that one American dead is a lot bigger than the statisticians thought it would be to us. And that's just a, it's a huge tragedy to go into that situation like that.

Speaker 6:          01:09:50       Well, in fact, I many times thought a body count was the dumbest thing we've ever come up with is a measure of success in combat. And I said that I don't know how many times and I am still convinced that was the dumbest thing we've done over the time. And I was there participating in it and it was terrible.

Speaker 5:          01:10:23       Yeah. So let's, let's go to Vietnam. So you, you volunteered for Vietnam in 1966 or 65. 66. Okay. And did he, do they automatically say, okay, well you're a lieutenant colonel, that means you're going to, you're going to take over a squadron or a battalion.

Speaker 6:          01:10:38       Oh, shit was the case. In fact, the fact that give him the army mark credit and just do now a nation along with everybody else. I was a lieutenant colonel arrived in country and I was assigned initially to be the executive officer of the Combat Operation Center of Mac v, which is the headquarters of all in the company. Operation Center was Westmoreland's, uh, operation center. And uh, it was run by a Marine Brigadier General Bill Jones by name. Uh, and uh, it was a great man. I mean, and I was his exact and uh, and we, uh, caught, ran the war, so to speak the word. We as a very loose term from the coc and uh, that was, uh, headquarters right there in Saigon. And, uh, it was a cushy job. I mean, that'd be, went to work on a regular hourly basis. I used to go in at night once in a while because President Johnson was going to talk to some of the action officers trying to find out what was happening to these patrols that we were sending out.

Speaker 6:          01:12:09       That's a serious sign of Micromanagement, Huh? Well, let me tell you, it was micromanagement of the first order. And I sought, absolutely sought an in happening more often than I care to remember. And, but I had one of the evenings I met one of my former colleagues, uh, armor who was commanding the first and the fourth Carrea, the first infantry division. And he told me he was going to rotate home in December. I said, can I get that job? He said, he take me up. And he introduced me to General Depue who was division commander. And I went up and I passed the test. He'd have to know general the Pew. And, uh, he was a no nonsense guy. Uh, he, he would, people thought I was crazy because general, the pew was relieving Battalion Commanders for incompetence, right and left. And I figured, you know, if you go up and do your job, you're going to be okay.

Speaker 6:          01:13:24       It went up and Gerald appeal energies interviewed me and general Hollins worked, yet it was the assistant division commander and Hollingsworth in Busia. No, Kaverman I mean, uh, and he couldn't, the two of the two of them passed on me said it was okay. And so I got reassigned to command of the first and fourth Camry, uh, in December of 1966, which was, uh, a plum job. That was, it was not only a plum outfit, but it general, the pew used to Calvary Squadron. Like it should be used many times later. My successors who are all not as lucky as I was. I mean, I was able to fight my unit has a unit. I had, uh, uh, three ground troops. One cal, Amina d troop was a helicopter school. A troop had 31 helicopters in it and I had division commander would assign a big company here, the tank battalion that was assigned to my unit. And then since there wasn't any real enemy aircraft, he assigned the several of the batteries of the any aircraft unit to my unit. So I had, uh, a unit unparalleled in history because general, the pew believed the calvary was supposed to go find the enemy and keep them there until he's an infantry could show up. And we did it more often than not in one of the stories I tell people.

Speaker 6:          01:15:29       Aye. Aye. Aye. I'm self-styled King of the Michelin Rubber Plantation, which is, you know, 70 square miles of trees. And historically there's little communities of workers throughout the, the, this place. And it became these little towns became havens for the North Korea, for the North Coast, north Vietnamese. And uh, uh, so we took it upon ourselves to evacuate everybody out of the little villages to the perimeter of the plantation and then took it upon ourselves to destroy the villages because the north Dorothy enemies were coming in at night using these places. In Shelly, our units. So we were destroying all these little hamlets. In fact, I had an engineer company assigned to me in one of the contest was between the captain who was the engineer company commander in myself. I'd give her my chopper and he'd be down on the ground and he was going to implode these village. Now if he imploded them all, he won any of the villages. Buildings would still be standing. I won. Now what did we win a beer and more often than not I won. He didn't win. He didn't lose many. But we got some in the spring of 1967 ambassador Ellsworth bunker arrives in Vietnam. The first unit he wants to visit is mine. There is everybody is what in the world of why did he pick this and why does he come to see you?

Speaker 6:          01:17:42       Well, he gets out there and all the, now he's got a four star general three star general and then division commander, all wisdom, and they were out in the middle of nowhere. I'm briefing to ambassador. I get it most so many savers. He says, colonel, I got more correspondence of my desk from the French about what in the hell you're doing up here destroying their village and all the people and causing all this commotion. What are you doing and why you're doing it. And I explained to him that why we were doing it because they disabilities were being havens for the north and they were coming in and Shell and are killing our troops. And I've always remembered him. See, colonel, he just keep doing what you're doing and I'll take care of the French. And I said, cat machine. I mean, I still get emotional. Was that that man, that gentleman understood what the hell was going on. And here we talk about State Department people not knowing what's going on. He knew what was going on and he told me to keep doing what I was doing and I did it.

Speaker 6:          01:19:02       But I will always remember him is I think at the time, I'm not sure this, he was either the oldest or next oldest ambassador we ever had in, in in the State Department. But he goes out there trapping around in the, in the boonies with me. And it was a rare experience. But anyway, it was a, it was one of those days, you know, when you really think you counted. Yeah. And he was, to me, that's leadership too. You know, he, he was, he knew what the hell was going on and he, he was able to tell me to keep doing what I was supposed to be doing. Yeah. He was, he was a great man.

Speaker 5:          01:19:49       So those operations, that was that the primary type of operation that you'd be doing is going into areas, uh, and basically disrupting what the enemy was up to.

Speaker 6:          01:20:01       Basically, we, the mission was searching, destroy, and what we did was go find, try to find the enemy and then destroy him. Uh, so in that, in the Michelin Plantation, we thought the enemy was not there, but we spent, uh, there was something called the iron triangle. North of Saigon is about 30 miles north of Saigon. Uh, which of of our operational area. And, uh, it was traditionally a haven for the, the north end or the whoever. Anyway, the guys that were shooting at us, and you never know whether the north Vietnamese are there are constricted south Vietnamese, but they all look the same to me. And uh, they still do. I, I'm never in Korea. I couldn't tell the difference between North Korea and South Korea. And I still could never tell the difference. When you're south Vietnamese and north Vietnamese, they, it, it maybe there's a way, but I never figured it out.

Speaker 6:          01:21:23       And so we just went in and constantly we're searching and destroy and if we, if we find the enemy and strength, our job was to hold them there until generally few and the could get his, uh, infantry into helicopters and bring them in and really defeat the enemy. Uh, on occasion we got in more of a firefight and we expected to be, but we, we generally, uh, we're pretty good at finding them in. The tanks would roll right through this forest and not the trees right down. And it was, it was no problem at all of it. And I was in my helicopter directing you, you could see in, you tell the tanks where to go, uh, in the tanks and Avycaz, which were primarily what the unit was all about. And so we, that was our job.

Speaker 5:          01:22:29       Yeah. So often I read about units that were over there that never, or very, very seldom would they see the enemy. They would lose guys to sniper fire. They'd lose guys to mortar fire, they'd lose guys to booby traps. But very seldom would they see the enemy. And you know, obviously there's units that are different than that, but it sounded like you were able to find the enemy on a fairly regular basis. Oh yes. Are they found us? Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.

Speaker 6:          01:22:58       You know, who finds who is, is not sure there's an answer to that. But yes, we more often that we got in, we had contact, uh,

Speaker 7:          01:23:09       uh, I had, uh,

Speaker 6:          01:23:13       more than I would like to remit casualties. Uh, which didn't happen because they couldn't find the enemy. I can tell you they could find us, you know, and often remember, uh, somebody a long time in my goal in my career. Tell me something about reconnaissance by fire. And I, I remember with a tank you had a lot of machine guns and you could do a lot of reconnaissance by fire and in trouble with Ricardo by fires.

Speaker 7:          01:23:49       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:23:49       You never know whether they see you or not. You just know there's somebody shooting at you. Well that's good enough. That's good enough. We don't need any, no other, he's aiming at you or not.

Speaker 5:          01:24:04       Uh, when you, uh, one of the things that also I talk about and I've read a lot about is the Vietnam war being very difficult from a leadership perspective for some leaders more than others. But because you had draftees and, and you had draftees, not just draftees that got drafted in, okay, I'm going to go do my duty. But draftees, they got drafted that literally did not believe in what was happening and barely even believed in America as a country. How much of that did, did you see and what do you, what was your, what was your leadership approach to those

Speaker 6:          01:24:41       troops? I saw the zero of that. I mean, I don't know. I was just absolutely lucky. I know I'm not that naive. I mean, uh,

Speaker 5:          01:24:51       I'll tell you the last few guys have been talking to and reading about this and, and there's something that I've noticed a trend. So have you heard the term millennials about the new up and coming kids? I know what millennials, so people complain about, you know, especially from a leadership perspective, people talk to me about, well, you know, I've got my company and we've got these new, these kids checking into millennials. They're different, they're entitled, they don't want to work as hard. And I, I started thinking about my head, well, basically you've got a workforce that's a little bit different. And this is very similar to the draftees and Vietnam who had a different attitude. And what I've found from good leaders is it didn't matter. It didn't matter that they had draft these. As a matter of fact, a general Ngukurr Yama who I just talked about when I talked to, when I asked him about draftees, he said, I didn't even know who was a draftee and who was a lifer. I couldn't tell the difference. And, and, uh, Colonel Hackworth wrote in his book, he wrote, I love the draftees because they were straight shooters. They didn't, we weren't trying to protect their career. They tell you what they thought, and you could take their input and you could do something good with it.

Speaker 7:          01:26:01       Uh, I've

Speaker 6:          01:26:04       said all along, the soldiers I served with in three different wars got better. And they were all draftees. I mean, I didn't never, Sarah with an all volunteer outfit. They were all, no matter where I was, they were draftees. And they all did their job. I mean, I've never had anybody tell me, uh, wasn't their job. It wasn't, this wasn't what they wanted to do. It was, they just did it. And I don't know this leadership or I don't just, it just the way it was. And, uh, they were all proud to be in our outfit. I mean now I'm sure other people later on. I mean, I've heard of people later on in, uh, in Vietnam having little problems with drugs and all that. We didn't have any of that. Now, fortunately, I left in 1967, so I'm not sure how things got worse perhaps.

Speaker 6:          01:27:21       But, uh, I think, uh, drugs are an issue period. Uh, but I don't know. I didn't have any of that kind of a problem. And as I said earlier, I'm not naive. Uh, I believe in, uh, knowing exactly what's going on. What you find out is walk around and talk to people. You don't sit in your tent or in your helicopter. You got to go down and talk to the guy on the ground and find out what the hell's going on. And that's, you know, there's a fellow who wrote a book, his name was Peters, and this is many years later, and he, he wrote the book, it's called management by walking around and here's a guy made a fortune just doing what I used to do. It's, it's scary, but it's true. That's what leadership is all about, is find out what's going on and then using it some common sense to tell people this is what you're supposed to do, or give them some guidance.

Speaker 6:          01:28:34       But I mean, people who used to tell me, well, you know how to do things cause you could order with people to do things. And I've seen, let me tell you some ordering a guide, you get out of a tank to fix the track when somebody shooting at you is not anybody willing to just do it. He's going to do it because he knows if he don't get the track fixed, we're going to get ass killed. I mean, we're going to get going. He's going to do it because that's his job and that that may be leadership. But I'll tell ya, it's discipline that comes from people being trained, right and taught right and treated right. You don't, if you don't treat people right, they deserve to treat you wrong. And I'm a great believer in treating people the right way.

Speaker 5:          01:29:30       Well, I, I'm just from hearing you talk about treating people the right way and listening to people, you, you're, you know, you say when, when I told people to do stuff, they did it well. Yeah. That's because you treated them well. You listen to him, you, you had those relationships with your, with your troops. And that's what makes people, like you said, when you got to have somebody that's going to go to go out and fix the track under fire, well that's somebody that's, they're not going to do that just because you ordered to do it. You better have some, some relationships. You better have treated them well and they must understand why. The why on the mission as to like, hey, why this is important. So when you, when you look back at World War II, Korea, Vietnam, I was from a tactical perspective, actually maneuvering troops. Is there any big lessons that you would think back of that you say, this is something that I did consistently or this is something that I would never do because I knew it would cause problems?

Speaker 4:          01:30:31       Hmm.

Speaker 6:          01:30:33       I can't think of anything.

Speaker 4:          01:30:35       Ah,

Speaker 6:          01:30:37       I'll go back to what I said earlier. I've always believed, and maybe it's just from growing up in Iowa, I don't know, just treat people like you'd like to be treated yourself and it worked out. Uh, I don't know. I told you about my first sergeant called me Fifi which pissed me off quite frankly, but uh, cause he was a guy who didn't treat people like people like to be treated. And I've always was amazed how much I exalted and the fact when he got busted, I mean w we were in England on the way over to continent and uh, he, he got busted for, I don't know what reason, but he got busted back to him. I mean, being a private, that's a big jump from first sergeant founded via private. And I was happy

Speaker 6:          01:31:44       because I didn't think this guy was, he, he's also the guy when I took the test to see what I could be smart enough to go to the military academies said, what the hell are you taking a test for? Therefore you're not smart enough to go to the west point. Then I always would like to be able to say to this guy, if I ever saw him again, I'm sure he's dead by now. I told you so. But you know, uh, if you don't treat people like they should be treated, they, you deserve to be treated the opposite way. And, uh, I just have always practiced or tried to practice it anyway. And uh, so far it's been relatively successful.

Speaker 5:          01:32:30       So that's a huge underpinning of leadership from, from everything I've seen. Everything I've ever read, every person I've ever talked to, if you care about your people you care about and you want to treat them well as human beings, that's the underpinning that really makes leadership work. And it's a lot of times, and you mentioned this earlier, a lot of times from the civilian side, they think, well, in the military you can just order people to do things and they'll just do it because you're the boss. And that's not true. And it's actually when I got out of the military and I started working in the civilian sector, I thought to myself, well, if, well, if you didn't want, if, if you want somebody to do something and they don't do it, you can just fire him. But that's not true either. Because guess what, you'll run out of people really quick.

Speaker 5:          01:33:16       And so what you have to do is you have to lead. That's what you have to do. One of those, the most core underpinnings of leadership is really caring about the people that work for you. And I think the more you care about them, and I know for me, like I, I, I cared more about my guys then I did about myself. I wanted to make sure that they were okay and that things were going to go well for them. And that was always my priority, my, my real priority. And Andy, I suppose someone that was a very jaded might think, well then you know, you're, you're going to get passed over. You're not, things are going to work out good for you because you're more worried about your troops. And the opposite is actually true and my career was, was it was beautiful and all I ever tried to do is take care of the people that work for me. Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:34:07       Because that's the way you get to be successful. You know, hiring people are working with people. You know, in civilian sector, you hire people in the village a week,

Speaker 5:          01:34:24       whoever it was that that was it get people. But I what he said,

Speaker 6:          01:34:31       your job is to make the boss successful and vice versa. The boss's job is to make Dennis successful. And if you've worked at it works out for both of you and to meet leadership, you know, we talk about it, but it's easy if you follow few basic principles, you don't have to have all the stuff that goes mean. People write books on leadership. You've probably written books on leadership yourself. Yes indeed. But the fact of matter, there's some basics and you just expand on it. You don't, it isn't that magic. If you just follow a few basic principles.

Speaker 5:          01:35:22       One of the things we talk about in the book actually is simple, not easy, because it is, there's the end. We say that in our book as well as we're not, we didn't vent to me this, this is stuff that's been around and there's no Eureka moments and we're not claiming to have at anything startlingly new. This is fundamental stuff that if you think about it, some of it might be stuff you already do as a leader. Someone would be stuff that you know you should do as a leader and just making it clear for people to understand is, is probably the, the only real benefit of the book itself. It's like, okay, this is good stuff, but nothing, no rocket science there. I didn't need to be a whiz kid to write that book. I can find it. So did you, you mentioned earlier when we were not recording that you actually ended up going back to Vietnam as and where you a civilian at that time? Yes.

Speaker 4:          01:36:22       Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:36:22       Well, my wife and I like to travel. So we've traveled most of the places in the world by now. And she wanted to go back and see where I had been in Vietnam. And a nice, wasn't too sure about that. But anyway, we had this opportunity. And uh, so we went back and I went to Hanoi, which was an experience and they go to the Hanoi Hilton and seeing how they've turned that into a propaganda place and have still remember, seen his picture on the wall of uh, Senator Mccain and a couple of other guys, I can't remember the names. Another one was what high school classmate of mine,

Speaker 4:          01:37:23       uh,

Speaker 6:          01:37:26       but day by name who was an air force or a retired colonel, he got the medal of honor. But anyway, in every showed them in these white pants and white over shirt is if they've read up on a barbecue, you know, Indian, you know, everything you've heard about this place was just, and they showed you some of the cages that they had people in. We have had

Speaker 5:          01:37:56       to get guests on the podcasts that were in the Annoy Hilton. And one of them went back and was talking us through that same propaganda went, went back to them and only Hilton as a civilian. And just the, uh, the feeling he had was, was pretty strong.

Speaker 3:          01:38:18       I can't imagine. I mean, uh, but you know, when I was there, I was just seeing it from the propaganda and what they, cause it's, it's a big tourist attraction apparently for the Vietnamese. And, uh, so we obviously saw it and knew what it was and, and for what it was. And I hear all kinds of stories about the people that were there, you know, but, uh, and then we went from there to Denang and then down to Saigon. And, uh, I'd hired a, uh, uh, a car and a guide to take us up, back up to my own operational area and Joe through the Michelin Rubber Plantation, which was sort of a fun experience to see. Now it's no longer, Michelin is a state on, uh, uh, they took it over obviously from the French, but, uh, it looks exactly the same. I mean, trees are lined up, rubber trees, just rubber trees, rubber trees. And people are out there working the trees. And, uh, I don't know if you know this, this is an aside, you cannot burn a living rubber tree. It won't burn. And I've tried hard. I mean, I had Flint, I have two flame throwers in my unit and we tried hard to burn those trees down on the sides of the road. Doesn't work, doesn't work. And so anyway, the, but we went back up to the old operation or a in the same place.

Speaker 3:          01:40:18       I was pretty close to her. I got wounded when I was in Vietnam. I was in my helicopter flying over this river and I was pretty close to where that happened. I could do that because I had to map coordinates of what I, where I had been wounded before. Otherwise I'd guarantee I'd never be able to recognize the place. But, uh, but I, my old, uh, base camp, which was because I had helicopters of where they had an airfield and now being turned into a, a strip mall. So, so washed all that happening. And uh, but it was a scene. Saigon again was, uh, an amazing experience to see what's what they've done. You see all these tall buildings now, but the one officers' club that was on the roof of one of the hotels is still there exactly the same. And we, my wife and I went up and had lunch there and it, my time before I went out to the unit, I used to go up there and we'd go up to eat.

Speaker 3:          01:41:40       You Watch out here and see the, uh, the sabers, not sabers. Um, what do you, what do you call the browns that are stressors? The tracers. Thank you. See all the tracers from being fired up, upper back down. And it was sort of unique experience because you really weren't fighting a war in Saigon, you know, it was, it was so different from there when you went out into the field. So, but, uh, it was, it was fun to go back and see what they've done. And I was impressed with how much the south Vietnamese have really been serious about getting real business and going and a lot of things happening. Business was up north. It's still a GRE. It was still a grant at the time. Very Agrarian. You, it mean very few tall buildings, very few businesses, and so that you could identify and maybe it's still the same that goes, that was, that was 11 years ago now. But, uh, and I don't know what's changed to over there, but so the north Viet Mimi's one no war, so to speak. Uh, I say that with tongue in cheek actually, but they won the war. But I'm not sure that the south Vietnamese aren't coming back and taking over and running the country. They certainly have the financial strength there. Uh, and I hope that's a way it, eventually it will work out

Speaker 5:          01:43:25       well the way the rest of the world's gone. It's in freedom and democracy and capitalism that eventually wins the long war. And we've seen that worldwide. So hopefully it'll happen for them as well. How'd you get wounded your third, your third time getting wounded in Vietnam?

Speaker 3:          01:43:40       Well I was, I was one of the missions we had every evening we'd go into a perimeter and most of the time we'd be in a perimeter around artillery unit so they could fire at night without worrying about getting over run. And so I put all of our unit in this perimeter from my helicopter flying around and I noticed a bunch of sand pants evacuating the area we had. So I thought in my John Wayne felling, I want to go down and shoot some of these guys. So I got to pilot, I was flying in this case, uh, in a a two passenger, I mean one passenger bubble helicopter. And uh, anyway, so I had this in 40, he noted him 40 years. It's as far as it looks like a shotgun shell. And so I'm up there and I'm shooting at these guys in the Sam, Ben, and I'm doing pretty good, uh, missing a lot, but he, so one of them shot back and my God, it hit me in the leg. And so I told the Jabber Pout, take me back down to the headquarters, which voters squat and surgery was. And he will never forget, he, he took my pants away and there was blood spray write out all the way out, at least 18 inches from my leg. Hit something. They call this burger. And he said, this is a captain speaking to me, colonel, you goddamn dumb, son of a bitch, you could be dead.

Speaker 3:          01:45:49       So anyway, he bandaged me up and the metal still there still in my leg. But, uh,

Speaker 6:          01:45:58       where you, where you, are you returning to duty though, right? Oh yeah. I mean, I hadn't been in command more than 30 days. I was scared to death. I couldn't be evacuated. Hell, I had finished up my tour. Let me, I mean, so one of my friends named Tim Kennedy is a green baret and he has a TV show coming out called hard to kill. I think maybe we need to get, you all guys know, somebody might take me up on it.

Speaker 3:          01:46:32       Uh, I, I've been fortunate. I mean, a lot of people got hurt a lot more serious than I've been. Uh, uh, and, uh, I've seen some, in fact, uh, I've had too many her seriously, I had, uh, one of my, uh, my axel was in the helicopter and got shot up to the seat of the helicopter and all the shrapnel, everything went right into his leg and he was forever, uh, in bad shape. I mean, I mean, I've seen a lot of people get hurt pretty badly. Uh, I been, I've been fortunate. I mean, but I'm also had the attitude, I'm not going to get shot and killed. I mean, no, it's worked out. But, uh, going back to, well, you know, when I got out of that tank to go back in Korea, I had no more idea that I was going to get killed, that that wasn't going to enter into my mind. I just had something to do. And uh, that may be foolish, but, uh, it's just the way it was.

Speaker 5:          01:47:58       Yeah. I think if you're, if you were thinking about what could happen, you know, wouldn't do anything, you couldn't do anything. Right. Yeah. So you're, you wrap up your squadron commander in Vietnam and again, I, I mean, you were taking, how often would you guys, you're getting in firefights a lot. What was your, what was your cash rate of casualties? Like how many guys did you lose? How many people were killed while you were there as a squatter

Speaker 3:          01:48:25       commander? How many were killed? Probably 10. Not too many. I mean, uh, when you have a calves, do you know what an ache have is? That's a personnel carrier. I mean, it cast has her armored calvary assault vehicle, but it's, uh, it's, it was the [inaudible] back in those days. I don't know. I don't know what they're called.

Speaker 5:          01:48:55       We still used [inaudible]. We used them one thirteens in Ramadi, the same exact vehicle. So we are very familiar with it. We both written in the back.

Speaker 3:          01:49:04       Yeah, well they're pretty well protected and the tanks or we had patent tanks and they're protected. So, uh, yeah, we had casualties, uh, because in, in a, in a calvary troop, we have infantry right in the outcasts. So when he get out, he got her. But I don't know the statistics. Uh, I, I wrote enough letters but not very mean one is more than enough, but, uh, I, I don't remember how many I wrote. Uh, but, uh, cause I did that for everybody was who's killed? Uh, but, uh, I don't, I don't know the statistics, uh, not to not overburden burdened. I mean, in this incident,

Speaker 4:          01:50:07       uh,

Speaker 3:          01:50:11       I got several people's names on the wall. Uh, I go there every year. She's just to stand there. But I don't know Jack who, I don't know the answer. Understood, sir.

Speaker 5:          01:50:32       When you got home from Vietnam, you know, you talked about coming home from Korea, Netherlands in uniform,

Speaker 3:          01:50:39       and

Speaker 5:          01:50:41       you know, we hear stories of guys coming home from Vietnam and they literally get told, don't wear your uniform around. How different was the reception from World War II Korea to Vietnam?

Speaker 3:          01:50:55       Well, coming back from, um, from Vietnam was a sad experience. Uh, we thought we've been doing a good job. We, that we were doing the right job. Um, and I came back to the Pentagon and I sort of witnessed the experience of the country being up in arms. About Vietnam. Um, so, uh, it didn't feel too appreciate it I guess is the right word. Uh, and yet it didn't feel like I felt like I'd been doing a good job. Uh, so I don't, I didn't have, I didn't have any bad feelings. Uh, most of those feelings about what was going on came after I got out of it. I mean, I retired in [inaudible] 69 and things began to go to hill in the country about what we're doing over there. A while right after I got out, I guess, uh, my job and uh, when I got out, I mean when I came home was in, it's at the secretary of defense's level. I, I told you earlier, the army was send me to school to learn to it with kids.

Speaker 6:          01:52:47       Well, guess what? When I came back, army sent me to be a whiz kid. I was, I was standing up to the secretary and General Staff, Helen n two ovens organization, which was called systems analysis. And they asked for all the whiz kids were, and they had a representative, the army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, all four of us. And we were sure the other end is a teetotaler. We were, we, we were supposed to balance some of these smart young men that were the quote kids. And as I tell people, I've never a whizzer a kid, but I was in that organization and if it was an experience, they wouldn't let me work on anything army. And I had, because they knew I had to go back to the army. She, that was, and you had to, you had to be sitting there and making decisions that could be a against the army, what the army wanted as opposed to one of the wonders, one of the things I was involved with, because I was involved with the navy and the air force, the navy wanted to build another nuclear submarine.

Speaker 4:          01:54:13       Well,

Speaker 6:          01:54:16       there's only so many capital ships that was by law.

Speaker 6:          01:54:22       So Davey, I asked why there was, I can't remember now, I think 13 capital ships or whatever the number was. I, yeah, why is that number 13? It took quite awhile for them to figure out the answer and it really was very simple. You're going back to the League of nations. Parley, introduce, I mean 1920 something when they, they pop partly down to the various world war of one winners. There are number of capital shifts. I, he called battleships, numbers of ships that each country would have and that's where the number came from. Whoa. I, Dan was just, uh, now I learned to ask that question because when I was going to Michigan, one of the professors said, he's just in statistics class.

Speaker 6:          01:55:27       I want to know what you wanted or watch, not what the results are. I want to know what the assumptions are and know. So I was asking this assumption, why is your x number of capital ships? It was just simple question. I, I didn't know I was creating a challenge. I mean it, it, it turned out to be exactly what I was saying. It was a strange phenomenon for them to try to figure out why there was that number. I don't know what the world is now, but I can tell you at that point, this was the 1968, I guess. Uh, it was, uh, a question that they took a while to answer. By the way, I don't know how many capital shifts we'll have and I don't know what to call the day, but we have a lot more than I think we had back in those days. So what made you decide to retire? Well, I had 25 years in the military and I decided I wanted to think about doing something else. Uh,

Speaker 6:          01:56:42       part of it was I used to listen to people tell me, you just order people to do things and they do it. I said, that's just a lot of Bulani. So I wanted to go and see who got my, if you would, uh, teeth on trying something Savine would world. So, uh, I signed a bunch of resumes out and I eventually was hired to go down to a Texas and a fellow that hired me was retired navy aviator, who by the way, uh, as an aside with assigned to the first squadron, I think it's called, it flew jets off aircraft carriers. Guy By name of Felix to Blonsky was a wonderful man. And, but if you wanted to know what time it was, he'd tell you how to build a watch. So there's that. But he, he, uh, he hired me and our job there

Speaker 4:          01:58:03       no,

Speaker 6:          01:58:06       was to figure out how to use from Ltvs, uh, computer resources, how to use these and civilian application.

Speaker 4:          01:58:20       And

Speaker 6:          01:58:25       one of the things we did was we developed for Dallas x's and o's that they used to do on the job board, on the computer screen, and just became a way that apparently Dallas cowboys would teach the guys how to react to whatever plays it was. So that was using some of this fancy technology, that LTV head to build something that was applicable in Savannah life. Well, laying of LTV, Lang Timko vote suddenly got challenged because he was creating, uh, a huge empire and the antitrust people got after him. And all of a sudden, our organism, the part that I was in was, went from 30 people to four. And that was one of the four. And I don't know, to this day, I still don't know why they can't meet you because I'd just been there less than a year. But the guy who had tried to hire me into computer sciences previously offered me a job with computer sciences.

Speaker 6:          01:59:52       I mean, even though I had a job, I knew that this place was not a place that had longterm open up B. So I went to work for computer science as an ethnic 15 years there and, uh, and ended up retiring from there, uh, is one of the presidents and one of their divisions. And, uh, one of the things that my bosses used to say, I was one of the few leaders, they had been a lot of managers, but, uh, I was leading a group and we became very successful, much more so than I ever imagined we could be. It was primarily in sales and marketing. And I had a boss that said, who was from my BM and strict IBM suit kind of guy, you know, you've heard all the stories. And he said, he said, if I would go back to my comrades at IBM and tell him that I just hired a former army colonel to piano sales, they all think I was God damn crazy. And so anyway, I had a great career computer sciences and uh, as I said, I retired from there and I'm not a typist. When I was going to high school, if you took typing, you weren't going to college, it was back. So this thing called voicemail appeared to me and I thought, so another fill on, I started a company in the voicemail business, 1984. And, uh, it, it was pretty successful and we sold it in 1998 and I've stopped working since then.

Speaker 5:          02:01:58       Well that is awesome. I know we've kept you here for a couple hours now and uh, um, probably a good place to at least stop for this, for this particular session. Um, is there anything else you want to say? Anything else you want to close out with what I can, I can say this that I met my wife,

Speaker 6:          02:02:19       uh, on my first assignment from the Pentagon and I, my job in the Pentagon among other things was to control the number of troops on the ground in Vietnam. Congress mandated be 550,000 people on the ground. My job was to be shared that that number was mitt. So when the secretary of defense went to Congress, he could always say that we have never heard. So on a quarterly basis I would go to Hawaii and in people from Hawaii, Thailand, Korea, Philippines and Hawaii would all meet at the headquarters here up on the hill. And we'd go over, cause what, when Westmoreland a lot to replace an attic battalion was an infant. You pertained to different numbers and everything's different. So we had to do all this monitoring and keeping track of how many troops we hit.

Speaker 6:          02:03:25       My wife was a school teacher in California and she was over there on a vacation and one of my former colleagues from Vietnam, she knew him and some on another. We met for the next two years, we dated cross country. She didn't California, me and the Pentagon. And I would go every quarter to the Hawaiian islands for this meeting I'm telling you about. So I'd plant the meeting to be started on Tuesday so I could fly from here to California, spend some time with her. Then I'd fly off after Hawaiian islands. And then on the way back I'd step into the same thing and it'd be a backer. So anyway, we got married in, uh, 19 after I got out or retired and 69. And we got married in October 69. And, uh, the reason I'm still living today is because of her. She keeps me alive, takes care of me. I made a, uh, so she's, she's, uh, the principal reason that I can sit here and talk to Ya.

Speaker 5:          02:04:48       Well then we'll say thank you, you for coming on and we'll say thank you to your wife for getting you here. Cause uh, sir, once again, this has just been a, an absolute honor to be able to talk to you, to be able to hear the stories and the lessons that you learned and thank you. Well from all of us for, for your service, your sacrifice. And it's been an honor.

Speaker 6:          02:05:14       Well, you all deserve the honor to meet you guys. I don't know what I'd be, what it would be like to be in the service today, frankly. I mean, I see these guys, my, my nephew deployed six times, twice to Iraq, once for the Somali extraction plus three other times, just the flying, you know, and

Speaker 7:          02:05:49       now

Speaker 6:          02:05:51       how he did this, I'll never know, but he never left camp Pendleton. I mean he did. He, he was a drill sergeant down at MCRD, but he'd commute back to back to Pendleton. I mean, his wife lived there the whole time. He was 20 some odd years in the Marine Corps on the same. I, I never figured that out. I moved around like, but my wife would tell you she, she and I got married after I got all this room for an our 17th outs. We've only been married for almost 49 years. I mean, so everybody said, well, you were in the military. We didn't do it this way. She was never in the military. We, we moved all the time since then. I mean, you stay in San Diego,

Speaker 5:          02:06:48       I'll do my best, sir, I'll do my best. And again, you have to absolutely. The troops that are out there today, and there's a lot of troops that listen to this guys out there hold the line and doing those deployments over and over again. But you know, the work that we do today is based on the lessons that we learn from your generations, from the three wars that you fought and what you passed on to us. And it was an honor for us to continue to carry the flag. So thank you. See You keep carrying it. Yes. Here. Yes sir. And Colonel Tom Fife has departed and obviously it is a honor to uh, get to talk to him and thanks for setting that up Dave. Yeah, man, that was awesome. Much appreciated. Three war veteran, I mean, come on, come on. That's just unbelievably awesome to sit and listen to and, and you know what, thanks Dave for setting that up and also thanks to everyone that, that supports this podcast so that we have the opportunity to bring people on like Colonel Tom Fife and be able to share those lessons on it, which there was a ton in there.

Speaker 5:          02:08:01       So thank you all for supporting an echo. If people do want to support,

Speaker 2:          02:08:06       sure.

Speaker 8:          02:08:08       Can you maybe fill us in on how to do that? Sure. Let me start with our company. Oh, or gin. That's the company or gene main.com is the website there. You can get Taco had supplements, you can get Jocko supplements, Jocko, Super Krill oil for your joints. Joint warfare for your joints. Don't run out. By the way, Dave Berg, you're, I dunno if you've ever been on the, in the situation of running out of super crew. When you depend on Super Krill, it's bad situation and if you ever want to reduce the risk of running out, do the subscription thing, that's what I do. Kind of subscription subscription. Yeah. You just get your allotted amount per month or however often you need it. Also pre mission supplement. It's called

Speaker 5:          02:09:04       discipline. Hold on Dave, you are firing up on discipline. You, you said, you said to me and I quote, I live on discipline. It has become a daily part of my life for sure. You've got it in the brain. Yup. You use it before you work. Yup. You're studying, you're working, you're prepping. That's your go to this stuff is awesome. I use it probably more than I should. Yeah, it's a jet. I don't know if there is a, some kind of uh, you know, limitation health wise, like if you're drinking nine gallons and gallons. Yeah. Jack. All right.

Speaker 8:          02:09:42       Well there, there it is. It's at the of everything. Pre Mission preworkout pretest taking, pre meeting, pre Jujitsu Zoo

Speaker 5:          02:09:50       and now you're going to get mad or whatever or you're going to make you give me your attitude because you know you make fun of me cause I wanted it to taste good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You make fun of me and there's not even that much I can say about that because it's a legitimate thing. True for, for me the Jocko to be like, oh I want it to taste good. It's kind of a weakness, right? It's kind of soft. Right. Well that being said, we have another flavor coming. I'm going to tell you what, well, first of all, it's a two things. Well first of all, it tastes good. Yeah, I know Bro. Second of all it's, it's, it's basically Pina Colada, but I can't call it that. And it's like I can't do, I can't do

Speaker 8:          02:10:34       that. It's going to be called the coconut pineapple. Sure. You know, we're not going just straight Pina colada cause I just can't. This is not, that's not how, no, no, that's not out, eh. Yeah. You did mention that and I'm impressed that you sticking with the delicious, a luxurious tastes clean, you know, do that. But that's one of those things like you like Pina Colada, you like that flavor. Like I've heard of people not really liking it, but that could have to do with the fact that you know how like when you drink alcohol too much and it has like a star, like Tequila, we'll have it. Peanut coladas is like that. If you just drink too many of them, you get drunk and that experience now you can never drink it again. Now if you smell it, you feel off. Tequila. Tequila is like that for sure.

Speaker 8:          02:11:20       During my younger years, I had like a 14 month hiatus from Jaeger after I had a bets bad sitch. Yeah, so peanut clouds. I was young and stupid. You know what young, stupid and motivated like you know when you're actually motivated the coroner to do with this. That's bad. Dumb. Yeah, but check, if you haven't had that experience with Pina Colada, I would assume that that's a, that's a pretty high rate of acceptance. As far as deliciousness goes. In my opinion or in my, by my estimation, I think my hypothesis or whatever. Nonetheless it's called disciplines, pre mission. This whether you love Pina Colada or love lemon lime ish flavor with other delicious factors in it. That's a good thing. But it's good because it makes your brain more healthy and your body pre mission preworkout pretest taking pre meeting, pre Jujitsu, pre workout cognitive and physical force multiplier. This is what that is. So get on now. And of course also Giza in rash guards. Dave Burke.

Speaker 8:          02:12:25       Yeah. You missed the milk. Yeah, I didn't really miss it. I was going to save it for last but not all. I'll get back in my lane over here. No, because the just had a whole thing. I was going to do it. Brash cards. Tell me about it. I feel like we should do the molten now cause you've got kind of kind of brought it up, which is you know, if for lack of a better term it's actually it, it is a better term. It's not protein, it's protein powder, but it's a better term for this particular protein powder milk, mint chocolate. Just because he didn't know deeper brick here on the milk yet. He's not on the market and just told me he's going to get it this week. Well I will say this, I never was into protein powder. Aside from, you know, you're still in high school, you're still not, I'm still hearing the mold, right?

Speaker 8:          02:13:10       Correct, correct. But this one is one of those good ones were kind of like you and the discipline where you're like pounding it all the time. So I give my daughter dessert. Oh yeah, this is a dessert straight up, straight up desert is that good? And don't put a couple of drops of the dill in there. Tried to do that. But two drops, little Manila putting an egg and put it in the blender. In fact, you know what? Don't do it. Don't do it. You'll be in the same boat as me. That's when the last, it's like a dessert and those protein nights. Good man cause I used to make these milkshakes when I was young. I'm just a homemade probably. Probably it nonetheless thing used to make these milkshakes when I was young they were, they had vanilla egg, like a teeny tiny piece of banana milk and some other stuff, some sugar in there and it was good.

Speaker 8:          02:14:04       It was like a solid milkshake like good, like almost like you bought it from a grower. May spot is no joke when it comes to milkshakes. Simulator, mint, mint chocolate, peanut butter, peanut butter, chocolate, chocolate, peanut butter milk is on its way. Straight up. Dave Burke. When you get on it you're going to stay on that. So you're just going to be pounding discipline and mock like all day. The way, the way Dave Berg, only days easier look like echo Charles swollen six months, dude, lifting, Jujitsu, walk, all that stuff. Also ds and rash guards. We can talk about that if you want, unless you have another suggestion on what else I should talk about at this point. I'm, I'm saying I want to do the right thing over here. I know what I'm saying. Dave Berg kind of get you up. Dave Berg. He diggy right? I do. I have to.

Speaker 8:          02:14:49       So here's the one good thing about starting Jujitsu with 45 I discovered the one good thing about it instead of starting at 15 is I never had any of those stories where I tell about how uncomfortable the gear is or how the rash guards gave me, you know, are they, these are hard to wash. I got origin main gives time to go from the get. Go ahead. Someone that never had a flip phone in 1994 just woke up and they had an iPhone six started with the iPhone 10 out of the gate. Origin man, rash guards. So I don't know what it's like to have grown up with all that terrible. Gary, you guys use what it was like.

Speaker 8:          02:15:28       Well that's actually good news in my, in my opinion. You know, because working, not working, but you know like working out and doing your due to the in a junk g pry the first gear head man. You know how you like any like you ever when you buy your first suit, same deal. Like you didn't know. I Dunno in my like I don't know how that thought that was just like, oh I see. Go suit on, let me go buy one. I don't know, whatever. So same thing. So I went and bought a g and it was like I bought a cheap one 40 bucks. I know. Straight up. See I bought my first Guiyu isn't a key I bought from the Quito store cause the Jujitsu place, they were like, it's 100 bucks. I'm like, oh cool. Not Happening. I'll go find a different one. And I found that the Cheapo unbleached. Have you ever heard of this? Unbleached cotton that was even cheaper than the bleach color. It's an off white. Yeah. It feels like it's filled with steel wool scratching getting your skin. But that's hard. And it lasted like four weeks. So yeah, get a quality, give yourself an orgy gay. That was Nikita. Quito, Quito Gig. It looked, it

Speaker 5:          02:16:30       felt similar. Yeah. From the external viewpoint to a Jujitsu guy, but it wasn't, and it damn sure wasn't made in America made in Maine. You know what's awesome is tend to know to literally know the people because we'd been to the factory. I know that people that, that made those, I know them. Yeah. I like I say, Oh hey, how are you doing? Oh, I'm over here making a key. That's real. That's what's happening. Yeah. And on top of that, not to mention the cotton, that was a loom to right there in the building by the way, is from America too. That's something you, so I was talking about Pete, about this, the cotton, it's not all carpets. It's um, what does it Polly, Polly, Polly. So it's a poly cotton blend and I thought that the two strands were different and it's woven together.

Speaker 5:          02:17:21       Nome, the, they make that, that actual thread is co cotton, poly cotton, the thread, the thread itself that you weave is, that's why, that's why you can put it in the dryer to dry like a normal piece of clothing, not four hours. You call it out in yourself to hang it up cause it's all cotton and it just holds onto the water. Vic cast gets out of their main America. Oh good. So yeah. Good, good. Dave Burke, boom. Origin G, no history of discomfort in other geese. No. No Stinky area of the house where wet ghees are hanging up for four days now. And I'll say this for all this stuff at origin, everything they make is awesome on their website that talk about the uh, the Hoodie and they call it the most comfortable of any ever. I grew up a hundred percent wearing hoodies. If you grow up in southern California, when it gets really cold out, you put on a Hoodie.

Speaker 5:          02:18:12       The origin Hoodie is the most comfortable hoodies I've ever owned. So that stuff is legit. No joke. No, no personal offense to you, Dave, because I respect you. I do, I really respect you as a person, but your level of measuring comfort is not even close to echo and echo is a sort of the quality comfort control guy and he has already made this statement. So you saying is like everyone is listening on whenever you were in the Marine Corps, you know you've done some, you know you've done some tough stuff in your life and they're looking at echo. They're like, wait, they have echo fits. It's comfortable where in that actual Steven has meaning. Yeah, yeah, I will. But I will say, you know, sure. Like of course Dave Burke of course we all knew that. You know I've, yeah, I am the gold standard of comfort evaluation for sure. I think and I will second that. It is the Hoodie and the pants by the way. So yeah, get those as well. All made in America. The compression gear and rash guards, all that. I'm just saying there's all this stuff on the website or did you mean.com and get all this stuff. The hoodie, the geese, the rash guards, sweat pants, other stuff. A lot of cool stuff on there. Check it out. You want something? Get something. Also the immersion camp. Did you get to camp? Boom. Just

Speaker 8:          02:19:28       got a message from someone from Florida young lady from Florida saying saying, I want to go to the emerging camp, but I won't know anyone there. And the only one from Florida. What do you think? Hey, you know me kind of. I guess if you could send me the message or you know me probably know Jocko to echo, you know me and that means you know Dave Burke, no, three of us, three people already. And here's the good thing where when you go there, we technically sure knew each other. And you knew Pete. That was the first time I met Pete. I met probably what? Like the first 15 minutes we met about 20 people and we hung out with those 20 people. Plus the other people you meet over the days. The whole time. It wasn't the kind of like, oh, I don't really know that a man. I'm hanging over here and they're over there. It wasn't, it's not like that.

Speaker 1:          02:20:21       You ever heard of those dating sites? No. Seriously. You put in dot. You look at, okay, so I grew up before dating sites or I got married before dating sites, so I was just like, who do the game back in the day? Like you got to go to a place where you can hopefully meet a girl, right? Yeah. They've odds of meeting a girl are not the girl that you like and that has some sort of remotely similar interests and you go into a bar over the hundred girls in there and like you're lucky if there's one of them there that's remotely interested in what you're interested in and you can connect. Then you've got to meet them and you got to go up and talk to him and all this stuff. It's real hard. Then they made the match dating things online where you put in your stuff. Yeah, and then you meet that one person and you connect with them and you have all these things in common. This situation, you think about it, you're actually just going into a place where everyone's into the same thing that you're going to do. It's like walk into a bar and everyone likes the same stuff there, likes Jujitsu and wants to train and wants to hang out and that's, that's what makes it cool.

Speaker 8:          02:21:17       Yeah. Yeah. No, no dating you typically. But Hey, yeah, that's a good point. It wouldn't kind of, you kind of converge on the topic of Jujitsu and then kind of everything else spawns from there. Yeah, totally. It really seemed like to me, and then everything spins back to Jujitsu. Yeah, it was good fun. So my input is to go, that's what I think. I think go when in doubt go. It's going, I'm going, life is going good firms jps considering he'll go, he'll probably end up calling. Yeah. So we'll be, it'll be a little ETF reunion tour of the Zhou sheets. Yup. Great. And when you go there knowing zero people, you'll leave. They're not only knowing more people, but they'll be kind of your friends. I will guarantee you'll have more actual friends after you leave guaranteed to the lady that emailed me. That's what I think that all that, that's cool.

Speaker 8:          02:22:15       And even if you will know some people there, I say go to because you can immerse yourself in Jujitsu. Best Way to learn and you know, let's face it, you're in Maine. There's a bunch of lobster. They serve lobster. Yeah. That was one of the highlights in my opinion. Anyway. Yeah, so it is on August 26 through September 2nd two sessions. Go to both if you want, but yeah, two sessions. There you go. All Levels. Also for fitness gear going to [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko they got kettlebells, battle ropes, jump ropes, all kinds of stuff. Good stuff. Very up. You work out, get some new gear. It'll actually get you more in the mood to do a workout when you, when they gear comes in. I guarantee that. Well, I don't know if I can guarantee that, but if that's how it was for me when I got the jump room, then all of a sudden I'm a jump roper.

Speaker 8:          02:23:02       It seems sane. It's good. Anyway, a lot of cool stuff on there. A lot of good information on there too. By the way. If you'd beginning like kettlebells are you beginning other workout movements and you want to know some tips and you know even some nutrition stuff really good. Anyway, go there on it.com/chocolate good way to support. Also when you get the books that Jocko reviews on this podcast, I organize them on Jocko podcast.com on the top. You click on books from episodes and it takes you to the page and it has, that's right. You guessed it. The books by that was for four on episodes by episodes. You see what I'm saying? Anyway, click on there, takes you to Amazon, you can shop and get your books, get whatever else do you want from Amazon, your batteries or duct tape, whatever. Keep shopping. Do you also, good way to support is to subscribe to the podcast.

Speaker 8:          02:23:54       If you haven't already, stitcher, iTunes, Google play, Spotify. Do you subscribe on Spotify or Arrow? I've been to Spotify. There's a lot more apps for podcasts now. Yeah, I think I'm going to explore some of them to Daily News of comes up daily. Um, yeah. Well either way, the point there is little change to their thing. What do you mean there? There's, there's there layout or something. So now it pops up different is definitely now I know, but it's like you ever realize when, when you the layout of something, so this was the big thing on Facebook. When do you get on Facebook deeper? Do you remember? 2014 14 Dang, that's, that's, that's pretty early environment for school. Okay. There you go. So were you in on Facebook when they kind of changed the layout of Facebook from something to something to like newsfeed negative Jocko Jocko doesn't know anything about this.

Speaker 8:          02:24:50       You know what I'm talking about at all? Huh? No I didn't. I didn't get on Facebook troll to till probably like 2000 I was, might've been on, but I didn't actively do anything on it till like maybe a year ago. Yeah, maybe a year and a half. So the layout of Facebook was like, you know, you had your profile picture and I even, I'm just trying to remember what it was. It was like, I don't even remember what it was, but it was like, I think like your wall or something like that where it's like you're just, you're your own stuff, and then they all of a sudden switched it to this newsfeed situation. You know how like now it's like everyone's stuff that you're basically how it is now and they just switched it and people were mad. It was like jade, like change their life, you know? They were pissed.

Speaker 8:          02:25:31       That's what you sounded like when you just talked about the apples. That's, you know, you had that same effect on your brain. Anyway, subscribe to the podcast is what I'm saying. Regardless of the layout of any iTunes or any other applications that the layout has or has not changed. Good way to support also wherever youtube channel. So subscribe to that if you want. And if you're interested in the Wii video version of this podcast, once you put chocolate looks like, or Dave Burke in this case, what he looks like. Pretty handsome, I think as far as handsome ghosts or Colonel Tom five yes. See what he looks like. Yeah. Typically those are the ones that people want to see. You know they want to see the guests. I want to see what they look like, what we look like. Yeah. It kind of already know except me.

Speaker 8:          02:26:12       I guess they don't really know what I look like cause I still do get, hey you don't look like how you sound, which is an actual thing. You can look like how you sound like you look like how you sound check and the same day Burke looks how it sounds, but it's not a one to one that's not a face to like your voice sounds like this. So your face is gonna look like it's not like that. It's like your, your voice sounds like this. So your face can look like this kind of real like this group, this little variety of faith possible faces as soon what I'm saying, that's how it works for you. Your voice does. I'm outside of that group. My face is outside of that group apparently. So if you're interested in that sort of thing, youtube boom. Also got the excerpts on there if you want.

Speaker 8:          02:26:53       You know, some of the lessons that chocolate talks about, you know, you want to share them, they're there, they're condensed or actually they're not condensed or just taken out it, you know, made little videos on there. Um, also enhance excerpts to put some music on there. Make a more, somebody asked for tracks, enhanced excerpt tracks into psychological warfare available on iTunes. Let me, does that make sense? Yeah. Enhance into an [inaudible] for too, by the way. Yeah, I agree. Even a lot of requests for things like that. I agree, but not from a personal interest standpoint because the psychological warfare one is still very effective. 100% effective for me, which I will talk about after I talk about the fact that Jocko has a store. It's called Jocko store Taco store.com. This is where you can get the t shirts, let's say discipline equals freedom, like the one I'm wearing right now, or the Jocko podcast shirt basic, but very nice.

Speaker 8:          02:27:51       The one that Dave Burke is wearing right now also missed. Where are you telling me you got called out with the Jocko podcast tee shirt. Where was that? I'm wearing this exact shirt. I'm at Disneyworld with the family two weeks ago from a cross. The way I get a good evening echo, that's the standard legit man standard mode of is good evening echo. Very good. Yeah, it looks good on you. Of course. And even if you want the one that Jocko has on now, the one that Jocko always has on right now, the one he has on right now and always has done. You see what I'm saying? Anyway, if you want that, that shirt going Jocko store.com or if you want a Hoodie or if you want a hat or if you want to rash guard anyway, just go in there. You can see, you know if you want to support that way.

Speaker 8:          02:28:32       There's a lot of cool stuff on there. If you want something, get something that's called Jocko store.com also, just like Jocko mentioned, psychological warfare is an album with tracks. Basically these tracks are each track. You can get these on iTunes by the way. So east track is Jocko telling you how to get past certain weaknesses that you might have, might have on your campaign against weakness. So you know you're on the path, right? We're working out, we're waking up early, some of us, and you know we're reading more of whatever we're doing. Sometimes you don't want to do that. You don't do that everyday. You just don't feel like it on some days, but you still should do it. We all know that sometimes you don't feel like it's who you're about to skip the workout. Boom, you listened to a certain track. Duck will tell you why you should skip the workout and it's effective.

Speaker 8:          02:29:18       You won't skip the workout. Take it from me. I know 100% from experience. It's what it is. Get it on Itunes, check. You know. Also speaking of subscribing, I have another podcast now that's called the warrior kid podcast. Good one by the way. Yeah, Uncle Jake has lessons. The name of the podcast is where you're going to ask uncle Jake. Uncle Jake answers questions from little warrior kids around the world and you can get that, play it for your kids. There's no foul language. There's no talk about the mee Lai massacre.

No. The, the Jocko white tea can I think is two servings and I think it's 30 grams total. I'll confirm that. Yeah, I shouldn't have said it. Would you ever consider making like another, another version in the future or anything like that? It's something with more hype person and more.
