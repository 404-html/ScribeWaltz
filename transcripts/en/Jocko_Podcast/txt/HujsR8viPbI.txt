Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number one 47 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. It's been a little while since we've done some Q and a so we'll do some Q and. A. Cool. Thanks to everyone for the questions that you have submitted to the podcast, just a reminder of what's the best way to submit a question. The best way is Twitter or Facebook and yeah, those are the best of your Facebook. My Facebook or my Twitter. I don't, the Instagram messages are just out of control. There's too many of them and I appreciate it, but I can't get a grip on them. So Twitter and and people would, if it's a long question, well the right three Twitter statements. If it's longer than you know that many characters, it's probably then go to Facebook. If this is like really a long, long thing, then just go to Facebook and send me the message.

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       What is that called? A Facebook message? Instant Messenger. Direct message. I think DM is like a con when Your Messenger on Facebook is what I get. I deal again, I apologize. I don't get to respond to all of them. Sometimes I just try and get somebody a little like the, hey, I read it. Hey, thanks. Uh, you know, you know what to do. Right. A lot of times people, they're just asking me because they want to get confirmed. Yeah, yeah. Hey, do you think I've, I'm having problems with this girl when she cheated on me, but I don't know if I should leave or not. It's like, you know what to do bro. You know what to do. So speaking, of course, thanks for everyone for the questions. And, and that being said, I still look at just about everything that comes in. Sometimes. Sometimes they get a little bit lost, but I look at everything that comes in.

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       Sometimes people, if you're listening, if you send me a question, some people would ask me a question that I've, I've literally been asked and we've answered on the podcast three or four times. So keep listening to the podcast because if I don't say anything, most likely it's because I've answered that over. I've answered it two or three times or you can deduce what to do just from listening to the podcast. You'll figure it out. Oh, I need to go get after it. Like you know, went into Elko. I think that it might be a good idea to have let go. What? Equity Cough frequently ass. Yeah, I know. I know. We do need to do that. Yeah. So let's do it. Check first question. We said that for like two years. Yeah, I did. Right when I said that I was like, should I think? Yeah, that'd be no 10 Debbie put together like a whole thing on that maybe.

Speaker 1:          00:02:40       Yeah she did. So we could probably dig that up and actually put it to use, which would be smart. Yes sir. I believe. I believe the same thing. First question, do you have any thoughts on what dis disciplines someone can use to improve their decision making skills as a leader? Not only in keeping clarity of thought during high pressured situations and environments, but also in making the correct decisions when it is vital. Okay, so we've talked about this last week. You have to learn to detach. And how do you learn to detach? You've learned it. Hatch by putting yourself in stressful situations and then observing how you react. So good stretch, stressful situations to put yourself in. Well, what makes you stressed? One thing that will make everyone's stressed, especially when they first start, is start with Jujitsu. That's gonna, that's gonna put you in stressful environments.

Speaker 1:          00:03:28       Look at sports. What are you going to do? You know, put yourself in stressful positions in sports. What else makes you stress? Public speaking, right? Public speaking makes some people really stressed out and start doing it more. What about competition shooting where you've got a, or hunting where you've got to do something in a stressful environment or archer, you know, I started started archery recently. You did? Oh yeah. Yeah. And so that's one of those things where you've got to learn to detach. You gotta learn to pay attention to things that are going on. If you're all caught up in the moment, then you're going to miss it. So that's number one. If you want to learn to deal with stress, put yourself in stressful situations that are under some kind of control. You know, even something like a paint ball, you know we do gigs and echelon front where we put people through what we call FTX is where you go out and you're going to fire.

Speaker 1:          00:04:20       We usually use air soft because it's a little bit more, it's a little easier to work with. But actually what we started using now is we've got these high end laser tag guns and so that's, that's what we use and they are super effective. They're there, they're awesome. They're awesome training tools. LikeW if we would have had them, if we would've, if they would've existed when I was in the seal teams, I would have used them then because they're that good. So we use those and we put people in stressful situations. Go hit this target. There's bad guys, there's, you know, people are going to get shot. There's people yelling. Put yourself in stressful, stressful situations and learn to detach. Put yourself in stressful situations with the purpose of learning to detach and stepping back mentally to figure out what's going on. Okay, that's first part.

Speaker 1:          00:05:04       Next part is how do we make good decisions? Well, number one, making correct decisions. You've got to study, you got to know and understand. You've got to know the background, you've got to know the historical outcomes of equivalent type decisions that have happened in the past, similar situations and if you know the history and you know the background, then you can use those to assess the current situation you're in. And then once you assess the decisions that you can make, assess the possible actions that you can take Admin, assess the outcomes that those decisions will have, those actions will have. And when you're doing that, you also have to assess the possibilities of inaction. So a lot of times people forget that one, they don't know. They don't know if they should do a or B. What they forget is there's also, what if I don't do either?

Speaker 1:          00:05:57       What's going to happen? Sometimes not doing either as good. Most that were a lot of times not doing either is bad. So you've got a or B, what should you do? Maybe sometimes you got to pick a or B. Sometimes occasionally it's better not to do anything and you wait and let the situation develop a little bit more. What? So the point of this is whatever you can know beforehand, you know, you learn, you study, you understand, you know the standard operating procedures, you know what various variations have been made on the standard operating procedures. And that's how you go forward and you execute. Now the thing that you have to remember is that you can't know everything beforehand, which is why it goes back to study and practice detaching and making decisions. So, so now let me dig into detaching a little bit. Let's actually break that down.

Speaker 1:          00:06:47       Maybe some mechanical steps that you can use. Number one, step back. Like literally physically take a step back from the situation that you're in and move your head and look around. So when we used to shoot, they would teach us to scan, like you would have to physically move your head. And what that is, is a mental reminder that you need to look around and assess what's happening. So once you've taken a step off the line, whether that's taken a step back from the table and you're in a meeting, if you're a, if you're a firefighter and there's a fire happening, take a step back so you can see the bigger picture. If you're in a cop and, and there's a shootout happening, where can you go to step back and get some cover and look around and see what's actually happening? If you're in a, if you're in a conversation with someone, stop talking.

Speaker 1:          00:07:32       If there's an argument going on, stop talking. Take a step back and actually listen to all the other elements that are shouting and yelling at each other. If there's a decision that needs to needs to be made, I don't on a planning situation, step back from the plan. Don't just take a step back from it. Look at it more broadly. So that's step number one is to step back. Number two, then you're gonna come up with, hey, one of the possible decisions that I can make. I could go this way. I B Abcd, ABCD. I can do any one of these things. Keep an open mind. This is the problem. Some people have as they come up with two decisions, three decisions, and they don't think about anything else, so you kind of have to like repeatedly detach. You kind of have to stay detached.

Speaker 1:          00:08:13       That's why it's good. You throw out an idea, like if we're planning for something and I come up with three ideas, I say, echo, what do you think of these? I give them to you. Then I stepped back again. I keep my mind open, so that's why the more you can get your subordinates to plan, the better off you're going to be. The more you can get the people below you in the chain of command to come up with an idea or come up with the ideas, the better off we're going to be because you're not embroiled in it. You're, you're defacto detached because you're letting them run with it. Then, okay. Once you look at your decisions and you've got to look at what the possible outcomes are, what are the possible things that can happen is this could, how bad could this go?

Speaker 1:          00:08:47       Risk versus reward. You've got to weigh those things out and you got to do it fairly quickly and again, you've got to, you got to figure out what's the result or possible outcome for inaction. And then you just weigh out these various options that you've created and you figure which one, which outcome has the most, which one makes the most sense? That's that's what's good. And like I said, inaction is some people like any action is better than no action, not always true, not always true. Sometimes you can learn more by letting things develop and letting things reveal what the status is. So that does make sense. And sometimes you do hold off. If if you, if you can see that a problem is getting worse though, we'll then we've got to do something then generally, okay, let's make some kind of a decision very quickly.

Speaker 1:          00:09:34       Now, one of the most important things to remember, and there's a little dichotomy to this, is that you don't always have to make giant decisions. You don't always have to make the, all the, the, the all powerful decision of might, you know, it's like, do we go or do we not go? You don't always have to say, we go. Sometimes you can go, well, let's push a little further. Let's, let's move. Let's move a little bit further before we make that decision. Or, Hey, let's stay where we are and see if it develops, or let's back up a little bit and keep watching. So instead of, we go and we don't go, there's actually a bunch of different decisions that you can make besides, we can go or don't go. There's a building, there's a bad guy in it. Let's go. Or let's not go.

Speaker 1:          00:10:20       No, actually, let's put eyes on the target for a little while. Let's, let's call and see if there's any other intelligence. Let's put an aircraft overhead. There's all kinds of decisions that you can make. Let's push a little bit closer. Let's stage, let's monitor. So there's all kinds of decisions that you can make that allow the, the situation to develop further and maybe reveal the proper decision to you in the long run. So the mice, my fear of saying that is that people get paralyzed. Where does it analyze the parallel and parallel analysis paralysis. That's my fear about saying that because the dichotomy is you can sit around and analyze and figure out and look at something for over for forever while the situation changes and now you lose. So yes, you don't have to make giant decisions, but at the same time you gotta be decisive.

Speaker 1:          00:11:12       There's a dichotomy. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Leadership is not easy. Wrote a whole book about it. Dichotomy. Leadership. Why? Cause that's what happens. So there you go. That's my assessment of how you can improve your decision making skills. Experience goes a long way. Yeah. It's one of those deals kind of when you were talking about the, the results versus the, the, the method, right? Decision making thumb. Sometimes like the result actually both method and results kind of the value isn't even in the results. It's like you having getting that experience going through it, you know, it'll improve your decision. Sure, sure.

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       Yeah. Anytime you can be in a situation where you're making decisions and getting experience out or you're going to get better at it. Yeah. Kind of the value in role playing that is a value. That's why we do a lot of role playing in echelon for like a little thing and people might think, oh that, how does that work? Come and get it. Totally get it. I watch people all the time, it totally improve as leaders because put them through a role play scenario as a leader where they're going up against a combative subordinate or a subordinate that's lazy or I subordinates angry or a subordinate that that wants to leave. Like you put it, you put a person in role playing in those situations over and over again and they get so much better. Three iterations, three iterations and people are exponentially better at handling situations.

Speaker 2:          00:12:38       Yeah. Cause it's like some, I mean most of the time anyway, it's just a matter of them like never seen it before. And then in the during game time it's Kinda like you got to make the decision super fast that you can't analyze from the role playing situation. You can analyze, you can do whatever and then t and then learn it. No a great, I actually should have brought that up. That's a great point. Is another way that you can get better at making decisions by roleplay for sure. Give yourself the options. Put, get put yourself, set yourself up a pressure situation and have people role play it out with you of what you're going to do. Yeah, so it's kind of like like mock, that's basically what it is. It is mock experience. That's basically what seal training, well not the basic seal training but the seal training that I ran, that's basically what it was.

Speaker 2:          00:13:20       We're going to have people act like bad guys. You're going to make decisions all day long. That's a roleplay. Get some. Yeah and again going back to like just seeing it once right is seen at one time is the D is way bigger difference than then. I mean compared with never seen it all versus seen at once. The difference between that is way bigger than seeing it like twice versus once you know, if you seen it once, it's Kinda like, okay, now I know. Yeah, it's, yeah. It's like night and day. It's night and day. The difference between knowledge and like, no, no, no. Knowledge is crazy. If we see that over and over and over again, like an Indiana Jones and the last crusade. You ever seen that one? I'm pretty sure. Wait, how old is that one? Like I saw the all like that series when Connor was a kid.

Speaker 2:          00:14:07       I think I seen it. So at the end, and they go through things, right? That they're like these booby traps. Right, and he'd get the holy grail. That's what they're doing. Oh, that I've seen this one because everyone in the guy's face melts, right? No, that's great. It's the last song when they opened the Ark. Oh, you got to shut your eyes. Yeah. That's old school anyway. No, this one, they have to go through these, like these tests or whatever. They're their booby traps to get to the holy grail. And one of them was you have to kneel. Only the penitent man will pass. That's what it says. And the grail diary, which is Indiana Jones Dad's diary that took all the notes. And so he's like, Oh, you've got to interpret that. Right. So they had all these people, there were bad guys there too. So they just send someone in there

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       and then the guide go in and his head gets chopped off. So you go in there, you know, hey that blade is going to come chop off my head. Cause I seen that one guy get his head chopped off. I'm just gonna duck just one time. It's, I got to know the blade's going to come out dunk. Thanks Indy. Granted, granted there was more booby traps and you kinda got to refer to the grill diary for the answers subject to interpretation by the way. But same deal. He see the point though, right? If you walk through a hallway, get it, then you see the guy get his head chopped off, you know. Okay, I better duck down your best doc. Yeah. Yup. I get it. Thank you. One time. One time. That's all it takes. Anyway, next question. How do you practice normal fee?

Speaker 1:          00:15:35       So same. And the reason that group these two questions together is because there's a little, there's some similarities there. You know, how do you practice normal face, which is a legitimate skill by the way. Yes sir. It's, oh, it's funny. Little game. If you haven't heard of what you do is, I used to do this for my kids. I put line them up and if they made any expression whatsoever besides just a normal plain face, I'd hit him in the head with a the inside cardboard roll up of a wrapping paper. So there's, there's the game and it's a lot of fun. We'd have fun doing it. Everyone would laugh. Well it's also useful in his adult to do be able to not show your emotions. So how do you do it? Same thing. Put yourself in stressful situations and you know, a good one is Jujitsu.

Speaker 1:          00:16:15       Jujitsu. If you can just like act normal, even when someone's just crushing you, then that's a positive thing. It's like, you know, sometimes you and I are rolling. Yes. And you'll be like, oh, I felt a sense of urgency is that's when I lose normal. It's failure to keep normal face a little bit scrambled because you're going to pass or something like that and then you, then you feel all good because you made me react, you broke my normal face. So yes, that's good. I would say the thing about normal faces practice it all time. You know where you practice it, you practice it like when you're driving. I mean I can't do this anymore because when we started this podcast I would get questions all the time about road rage. How do you prevent road rage? How do you permit roadmap? I think everyone's so in the game now that there they figured it out, but that's a good anytime where there's something bad happening, like something annoying. Something like the line, the line at the DMV, the line, wherever and you just just, just keep normal face and just act like whatever. Detach and he'll just act normal in Jujitsu when you're in between rounds. Don't act tired. Yeah. That's like one of my, I try and maintain that rule all the time. You

Speaker 3:          00:17:25       taught me that, oh, I don't even know if you meant to teach me that. And I told this story before but I would roll up, you're going to hear it again. We'd roll and I be tired of whatever after rolling with you. And then you know, and people do this all the time and it sticks. It's like a red flag to me. Not a red flag warning of it just sticks out a lot. When people do this after the round, they'll just flop on their back and be like, you know, like breathing all hard kind. Just you know, indicating

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       that, Whoa, that was a tiring round. Right? Yeah. You need to have tire grounds, get it kind of thing. And then this is the message that you conveyed to me through your actions. You didn't tell me this, so I wrote a few and I do that or something along those lines. Right. And you like stand up, not breathing through your mouth. I remember that you're just like, you know like mouth closed and then you were looking at me almost like you're disappointed in me. Came back. Yes. I realize you probably were and you said you look a little tired and then you just walked away. Like almost like that was the bad part. The the part that I looked tired that that was like the bad part you didn't like. And I was like from literally from then on I'd act like I wasn't tired in between.

Speaker 2:          00:18:34       Even if I was tired, I've tried to act like I'm not tired actively. That's so important. It's important in life. Yeah. You know, it's important as a leader it's more way more important as a leader than anything else when you start to break things. Well, I don't know if you have any examples, but like I think of times in my life where I would see my leaders start to break and just think like how horrible that is for the rest of the team and I'd be looking at a leader that was breaking. I'd be like, man, you aren't letting everyone down and you're not going to do it to me. I'm going to, you know what? Actually this is an opportunity for me. If you're looking weak, I'm not going to get all aggressive, but I'm going to, I'm going to make sure that people aren't going to follow that attitude because that is going to hurt us all.

Speaker 2:          00:19:19       Yeah, so as a leader, normal faces even more important. I'm not saying you never showed emotions at this dichotomy. I'm not saying never show emotions as a leader because you absolutely do show emotions as a leader, but you make sure that they're controlled. You make sure they're not emotion, negative emotions. So am I saying to not be yourself? Yes, I am. Because if your self is being a week a week loser and you're in charge of a team and you show everyone that you're wrong, no, you need to stifle those emotions, which we've talked about before. You just stifle those. You need to act. You need to act like, hey, we're going to make this happen. This doesn't mean lie to them. This isn't like a, hey, the boat's sinking, but don't worry, we're, it's going to be okay. No. Hey, guess what? Boats sinking. No, we're going to do, we're going to break out.

Speaker 2:          00:20:06       A life jacket is going to form into pool. We're going to grab whatever we can off this pastor. We're going to make sure we get, you know what I mean? As opposed to boat sinking, right? Yeah, it's true. So you lead check. So if, um, what like when your kid falls down, right? Yeah, totally. Totally. Like, oh my gosh. Are you okay? Yeah, no negative. Yeah. Wait. Oh, how's it? I was at the park. My son two climbs up high on this thing. It's like, it's slanted a jungle gym kind of thing. It's just slant it. It's like pretty high where it's not like so high that he shouldn't be up there. It's not that, but it's, it's high where you got to keep an eye on that thing right there. And sure enough, he takes a step or whatever and just straight up falls to the ground and the ground is ah, the ground was like a bunch of this weird hey kind of stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:20:54       So it's, it wasn't like concrete, put it that way, but he fell down, pull on and the kind, you know, looking at other parents who are looking at it. My wife is sitting right next to me. We've kind of far away me, literally grabbed her like, don't run over there. And um, my daughter was there, she's super caring too, so I'm like, ah, I should have grabbed her too. But she's far away anyway, so he falls down. Of course it doesn't cry. He's more like surprised and stun and looking around almost with the look on his face. Like, how should I react to him now? That's exactly what he's doing. Yeah. And then, yeah, it's all good. I mean, yeah, my kids would take a digger, I'd start laughing you don't like, oh, that was awesome. Yeah, it makes sense. And they're like, really? Yeah, that was awesome.

Speaker 2:          00:21:39       We got little Skinner. Nice. Look, you're bleeding. That's going to leave a cool scar. You're awesome. Welcome to the club. Yeah, that's a good one. Like so like that's awesome kind of thing. I'll be like, oh, I stand up strong, hurry up, hurry up. Like kind of like you got to beat it and like show me how strong you are kind of thing. Oh, I did that the other day nonetheless. Yeah, so he got up and he didn't cry. Of course he goes to high asphalt to injury. He landed correctly. How many feet? It was taller than I stand, so, so we're talking to seven feet. Seven, six, six. Yeah. Over over bigger. Yeah, it was. It was solid, but he landed good. Like if you would have landed on his head, that's an injury straight up. But he felt like good, which is lucky.

Speaker 2:          00:22:26       But yeah, nonetheless. So yeah, the point is if I were to who it like ran over there, something like this, it would have jammed him up. Oh yeah. Isn't that why the airline pilots, when you get turbulence, they're like, hey everybody, just go ahead and buckle your seat belts. We're, we might feel a little bit more that you know, instead of, hey guys, we're good. Yeah, I very much appreciate that when we do that, by the way. All right, next question. Next question. I tell the team we need this done by 3:00 PM they say got it, we'll have it done by 3:00 PM but they don't deliver on time and tell me, well we didn't know we needed it done by 3:00 PM how do I take ownership of this? Yeah, this is it. This seems like a tough question, right? But it's actually not that tough of a question because what you think is like, well they said they were going to get done then they didn't get it done. Then how could that be my fault? Right. And maybe that's not how the question is meant, but that's the way I'm interpreting it for the purpose of this answer. True cause maybe you just meant like, hey, how do I take ownership of this? And if that's the way he meant it, fine. The answer is the same actually. So what happens is if, if it happens, what happens is if that happens with your team, then you take ownership of it by recognizing that you did not communicate effectively. Because if your team

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       isn't doing what it is you need them to do, that is actually your fault. As the team leader, they either didn't understand how important it was or they didn't understand how solid that deadline was or they didn't understand that when you said this thing needs to be completed by three o'clock that you meant completed by three o'clock maybe it's cause you usually say, hey, we need this done tomorrow at two and you give him slack and they just kind of take advantage of it, blah, blah, blah. Then you know, if you want to take ownership of it, maybe you didn't follow up enough, right? Maybe you trusted them too much. Whose fault is it if you trusted him so much that you just let them, you showed up at two 59 is it done? Well, no, we didn't think it was due. Like we didn't know you needed an action.

Speaker 1:          00:24:27       So whose fault is that? It's your fault. You trusted them too much, maybe you gave them too much leeway, right? Maybe you give them too much leeway, too much decentralized command, dichotomy, leadership. Maybe you went too far with decentralized command. You said, hey, if get this done by three o'clock for out however you want to do it, I'll be back at two 59 and you roll out and that's not done. So what do you do? You come back at three o'clock it's not done. Did is your fault? Do you take ownership of it? You say to your team, look, hey, okay, so how, how do you take ownership of it? Cool. You fixed the problem. How do you fix the problem in this case? Well, guess what? Next time I tell you something is not done at three o'clock I'm going to check in with you.

Speaker 1:          00:25:03       I'm gonna check in with you a few times. Here's the progress that we want to make. I don't want you to be here by this point. I want you to be here by this point. I want you to be here. That by this point. And that puts us on track to finish well ahead of three o'clock. Yeah. So let's make it happen. Are you going to micromanage a little bit more? Yes, you are. They missed a deadline. You're not allowed to miss deadlines. Not Allowed to miss deadlines. Do I micromanage you? Echo Charles? No. Have you ever missed a deadline? No. Well, there's been some hot gas that didn't come out on time, right? Yeah. I guess the, depending on the lunch meat, I guess. But yeah, there's been some podcasts that didn't come out on time. Yes. And I would send you a text like, hey, just wondering if you knew about a podcast that was supposed to come out five hours ago that happened one time.

Speaker 1:          00:25:47       Well, no. Two things. I think it's happened two times. One of them. Yeah. So you don't warrant micromanagement cause you, we've done 147 podcasts and you've had two that weren't out on time. Do I need to micromanage? You know, I don't. Don't need to because we're all good. The podcast. Hey, occasionally the times that they didn't come out, one of them was like straight up operator error where you were like, I didn't press the button publish or something really lame like that. The other time it was like major technical difficulty. We got a problem, it's going to be a couple of days. Then there was another time. What was the other time when we went to Maine last year and what happened? We just got there. The on the night that I was supposed to publish in my mind was just distracted by the new, I had lost my camera. It was a crazy time for everybody. And uh, you know, the next morning you still um, you know, graciously posted a picture of me sleeping

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       on the plane by the way, and said movie. So working to Ecuador publish a podcast publicly, which is complete violation by the way. Take a picture of me sleeping. A fun. Yeah. Yeah, it was, it was actually completely warranted because it really captured like what it felt like. I just totally spaced it out. So my point is you get stuff done on time. You have a good track record there. No need for micromanagement. If you were, if you were hitting a lower number, if every, you know, once every once a month, it wasn't on time, you'd be hearing about it all the time. For me, I'd be like, Hey, we good tomorrow. We good? Yeah, I'd be checking in with you until you got so mad at me following up with you. You would just be like, hey, I got this and you would never miss it again because you didn't want to be bothered.

Speaker 2:          00:27:25       Right. So for this one, again, it's important to remember that with the idea of extreme ownership, it's not just like, oh well I'll say this is my fault. No. When you're in charge of a team and something goes wrong, it actually is your fault. It actually is your fault. And that's all there is to it. Maybe there's some people you need to fire because they are the, they're at fault for this mistake happening and you've let it go too long and you didn't get rid of him. That's your fault. But it actually is your fault. How do you take on or how do you take ownership of it? You fix the problem. Maybe you got to, in this particular case, maybe you've got to step up the micromanagement. That's, that's the way it works. Yeah, it makes sense also to the W and I'm speaking from a perspective of someone who could very well easily space out this project by 3:00 PM by the way, that's, that's potentially me.

Speaker 2:          00:28:15       But this is, this is when it can't happen. Um, where let's say I get a list of like two or three things, whatever I gotta do, right? Like, Hey, we, you know, we want this or whatever. And then let's say it's not necessarily by 3:00 PM let's say it's like by next week, Friday. So I got a week and a half to do these three things and then the next day there's like another list of two things. Then the next day after that one things is, hey, you know what? This is the priority. Three days later after Lisbon establish, hey, this is the priority. Get this done first. Then you got one more thing. All right, so this thing that I said, yeah, got it. I'll have it done by Friday kind of thing. She sorta get shuffled in forgotten, you know, like forgotten. So maybe I didn't organize it or what's your point in saying this is putting yourself on report?

Speaker 2:          00:29:01       Are you saying that you need to make a list? Are you just saying you need to write things down? People that miss things, you know you do your write them down. I used to make little boxes. I'll show you some of the checklists. You come to my house, I'll show you checklists. I used to make their, I mean we're psycho OCD, little checklists, little boxes next to like I would be going on a trip. I would make a little box socks, t shirts, everything. Every single thing I was taken I would have on a list. I still got those lists. I got bit deployments from the, the nineties of what I took on deployment. It was pretty legit right there. Little boxes, little boxes in the 90s they were written down on paper in the two thousands I got the computer. I print those things out.

Speaker 2:          00:29:41       Note App. So, hey, you haven't, you will have problems if you personally are telling me that you have a problem, you've got to write something down. Yeah. So yeah, and obviously you know mean you're different. I don't have those kinds of notes, but what I'm saying is uh, yeah, like that could be your methodology of your micro quote unquote micromanagement style for things like this. Just make sure they got it kind of thing like yeah, for sure. Things, I'm thinking about fact there could, you can, you can give lists. I normally wouldn't have to do this, but sometimes there's been a couple times in my life and career where I'd have to give people a list like, hey, I hate the boxes for them. Like, Hey, here's what you got to get done today. Make sure we understand each other. I would only do that if they drop the ball a couple times.

Speaker 2:          00:30:22       Like all they didn't get this done that he'd get that done. Okay. Guess what I need to write down and make sure it happens. Yeah. So yeah. And again, it's not like, Eh, I'm not saying it's not my fault cause you give me too much. I'm not saying that. I'm saying like not everyone, me, I'm talking about me. Not everyone's as organized as maybe you, you know, so they're going to need some micromanagement in this particular way. You know? Maybe cause maybe that's it. I mean I think the tone here, the question could be me totally could be made mystery, but it kind of seems like, hey, they said they got it and they didn't get it. What more do you want from me? Kind of thing. You know the banker. That's a good way of putting it and then I just gave the list of what more you can do. Yeah, exactly. You can spell it out for him. You can micromanage, you can check and do checkins with them. Do all those things. Yeah. Very good. Next question. The question you must have strong feelings about current events and politics generally given your experience yet you remain silent on this issue. Why? To appeal to a larger audience or the soldier's mentality of not criticizing the commander in chief? Is that, why

Speaker 1:          00:31:28       do I have strong feelings on current events and politics? Uh, sure I do, but they're more broad. So I have very strong broad feelings on current events and politics. I am a patriotic person. I believe very strongly in individual freedoms of human beings. I believe in having a very strong military, I believe in having a small government. So I have strong feelings about those things. However,

Speaker 1:          00:32:05       I don't have strong feelings about the nonsense and micro dramas that are on the 24 hour news cycle that are just content and social media. Just constant things. I know we talked about this a lot, last podcast, things that don't matter. So much of the current events don't really matter in the big picture to me or even to the country. And you know, I was uh, on Ben Shapiro show and you know, he was, I basically said, look, look, like be overall Americans have sort of the same goals. And he said, I don't know if I believe that. And I said, well, I work with all kinds of companies with people all over the country, and the people that buy a guy like Ben Shapiro, here's from, he's just, he's just bombarded by the extremes on both sides, 24 hours a day. I don't want to be in that position of getting bombarded by these extremes 24 hours a day.

Speaker 1:          00:33:12       I said, Ben, you're right. There are some people in the country that believe the far left or the far right. I said, most people are concerned about their life and doing a good job and you know, building their business or do you know, by paying down their mortgage, that's what they're concerned about. And so they're not like freaking out about the little every little micro drama that gets unleashed into the press and social media every single day. And so, so why do I not join into that? Cause I don't want to join into that. And also I don't want to make a podcast. I don't want to spend all my time making a podcast that's, that's out of date. The day it comes out like I don't want, I don't want to invest my time in that. I don't want to, and guess what? There's, there's literally giant multibillion dollar news media outlets and guess what they do?

Speaker 1:          00:34:05       That's what they do all day. That's what they do all day. They make up story about this thing and that thing and this thing where I can't react fast enough. It's just dumb. So if we were to be talking about current events, then by the time the podcast comes out, the parent event has been over, some people are listening to this podcast and it's, it's, it's 2022 right now. Right now. Some someone is listening to this podcast right now and it's 2022 no, there's, there's no topic of current events that we could talk about. Oh, barely any that actually impact what's happening four years from now. People, I meet people every day now I meet people that, that say, Hey, oh man, I've been listening to podcasts. I'm on 28. Um, that's, that's two years ago, right? That's two years ago. What was the, what was the current events two years ago?

Speaker 1:          00:34:53       They were totally different than they are now. Yeah. So, so there's that. So that's why little current events thing as far as appealing to a larger audience, that part of the question, well, if my goal was to appeal to a large, larger audience than I think I actually would talk about the trending stories of the day and put out little little clips of soundbites of all this stuff. And instead of, instead of doing what I do now, which is to read a hundred year old out of print books, like that's a great way to build an audience, or let's talk about the Rwandan genocide or let's talk about the Holocaust, or let's talk about the rape and Nan King, or let's talk about the mee Lai massacre. That ought to build a great audience. So, so the idea that, oh, I'm trying to build a larger audience. It's like, no, actually people that want to listen to this one to listen to it.

Speaker 1:          00:35:40       I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to build an audience by manipulating what, what I'm thinking about. No, I'm actually, I'm, I'm talking about and I'm diving into what I find important and what I think I can learn from and I get more out of this podcast, isn't anybody, I mean I know a lot of people say, Oh, I've got a lot from your podcast. I get more out of it than anybody cause I get to dive deep into this stuff and really look at it. So no, it's not the trying to appeal to a larger audience. In fact, if I wanted a larger yard, large arts, I'd do exactly what you're talking about as far as the soldier's mentality of not criticizing the commander in chief over. I actually don't agree. I don't agree that that's a soldier's mentality and I don't believe that it should be a soldier's mentality.

Speaker 1:          00:36:27       The soldier should question their leadership and now should they do it tactfully? Absolutely. Cause I don't want to be surrounded by yes men. That's, that's wrong. Also, if you at, what am I trying to say? This is just a general leadership principle. What am I said a thousand times on this podcast? I'm trying to build a relationship with a person above me in the chain of command. So when I was in the military, if I wanted to have influence over my boss, over my commander in chief, what I outwardly criticize them and make, make them think, oh, this guy just doesn't like me. I'm going to take my first chance to get rid of them or not promote them. No, I'm actually going to play the game and I'm going to look and say, okay, boss, Hey, I see what you're doing here. I want to support what you're doing, but does this make sense? Can we do it a different way? So I'm trying to build a relationship with my boss up the chain of command. I'm not trying to ostracize him by, by making them look bad, or by openly criticizing my boss in, in, uh, in, Oh, in the open, because what have I done? This is my boss going to listen to me. No, actually my boss isn't gonna listen to me at all. So

Speaker 4:          00:37:30       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:37:31       I don't want to be surrounded by yes men. But at the same time, if someone's making a bad decision, if someone's doing something that's a moral or legal, I'll call him out on it all day long.

Speaker 1:          00:37:40       Now the other thing that happens here is this is a new world and it's a bar, and this is a binary world of sound bites. That's what we've done. We've created this binary, binary world of sound bytes. When most answers that you want to give as a human being aren't one sentence or two sentence on the far left or far right or far light or far dark like there's going to be, you have to explain things a little bit more and but when you take these binary soundbites, everyone's immediately thrown into an extreme category on the far left or the far right, and as soon, and here's the bad part, here's the really bad part. As soon as you get thrown into one of those camps, then have the other camp stops listening to you completely. Yeah, they stop listening to you. Anything you say so you could, you could make a great point, but if you're on the other side, doesn't matter.

Speaker 1:          00:38:41       No one's listening. They don't want to hear it because you're on the other side. You're the enemy. It's a binary world. You're either with me or against me and there's no in between. So that's kind of what we've created and what I would rather do is have people actually listen to what I say broadly and make their own choices rather than me trying to force an opinion down their throat. This is the way it is. This is the way it should be. And by the way, just like leadership, you can't force people. You can't force an opinion down someone's throat. If it doesn't work, you can't. Sure it'll work for 30 seconds. It'll work for five minutes and to work for five days in a leadership position. Yeah, you better do what I say my way's right. Eventually you, that kind of leadership does not work.

Speaker 1:          00:39:17       And it's the same thing with trying to force an opinion down someone's throat, throat. If you listen to what I'm saying, you can form your own opinion and I would rather have you do that because that's going to be stronger than some opinion that I tried to force down your throat. Yeah. Which doesn't work by the way. So I would rather people listen to me and not just sound bikes and see where I'm coming from holistically and see where they can agree and disagree and see what feedback they give me. Because by the way, I could be wrong about something which I have no problem with. But I would rather do that. I would rather have that approach then join the pack, whichever pack that has joined the pack on the street and bark loudly like the rest of the dogs. I have no interest in doing that. So there you go. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          00:40:12       And it's funny, man, you're, you're like one of the few people who don't even know, you know, like that whole thing. I mean to sum that up, I mean I've heard that before where someone would be like, Hey, I'm, you know, I'm like this one. But it's so it's so few people that actually do that the way the way you do, even in real life, like in real life, like he, you don't, even when political stuff will come up, it's real obvious that you didn't jump in to any specific group.

Speaker 1:          00:40:38       Yeah. So this, this really ties back to last week's podcast of getting involved in things that don't matter. And there is, there's just so much out there that doesn't matter. Now where you have to be careful is that that there's so many things that don't matter. But what I am not saying that little things don't matter. You see what I'm saying? There's a huge disparity between those two things. There's a lot of things that don't matter. What I am not saying is that little things don't matter because there are little things that do matter and the classic example that we brought up over and over and over again on this podcast, it's like, oh, the Russian soldiers, not shaving and Chechnya and how that led to there eventually. Okay, not gonna Shave now. We're not gonna clean our weapons now. Now we're not gonna stay awake on a watch.

Speaker 1:          00:41:25       Now we're not going to execute. The missions were being told to do. Now we're getting beat. There are little things that matter, but if I'm barking day long about things that don't matter, then we have a problem. We have a problem now I'll tell you something else. There has been some issues that have come up lately. There was one issue that I was going to address on the podcast, but, and I still might address it because it's a small problem that I see as being a more significant problem and if it continues down the road, but luckily at this point there's, there's a whole pack of dogs barking about it. It wasn't like, it wasn't like I noticed this problem. No one else saw it. It was like, I noticed this problem, so did millions of other people and they all those dogs start barking. Okay, so now what am I going to do?

Speaker 1:          00:42:13       Good bargain with them. It's like, okay, now if there comes a time where all of a sudden I realized there's one of these small things that matter or a big things that matter that I don't see getting the traction that it needs, well then I will absolutely say, Hey, this is what I think about this situation. Generally there's so many people barking and they're barking about the same thing. They're barking about a lot of things that don't matter. They're barking about some things that matter and right now, unless, I mean, what do I say all the time you, the less, the less you speak, the more people listen. Yeah. So if I want to give my my opinion on the Daily News, every hour on the hour, no one's listened to anything I've got to say, and then it's a waste. It's a waste. It's a waste of my time because there's more important, there are more important things when we can, when we can dive into human nature through the lens of war, through the lens of leadership, through the war of a traffic.

Speaker 1:          00:43:10       If we can learn and teach people about the past so that we can prevent it from happening in the future. That to me is infinitely more impactful than barking about some current event that's happening. That's going to be gone in a week. It's amazing how far, how fast stuff comes up on the radar. It's all over the headlines and in a week it's gone. In a week it's gone. Yeah. So I just not going to play that game. I have. I don't, there's no point in doing it. That's a really good way to put it. It's like these current events, most of the time seem to be shaped in a way to just for dogs to bark about, you know, what it is like here and then, then the bark and the next thing you know. Yeah. Okay. Mark about this now the, the sound bite thing is really interesting too that everything is a sound bite and it either puts you in one camp or the other camp and the fact of the matter is you can't put me in a camp.

Speaker 1:          00:44:05       You can't cause I got beliefs that you don't understand. On one side. On the other side. Yeah. You know, and so what? You can't talk to me about that kind of thing. You can't, not that you can't talk to me, you can't put me in a camp, but the instinct of the world right now is take that person and put him in a camp. I'm not going to the camp. That's what's happening. If you want to figure it out, what I'm thinking. Listen, what I'm saying about listen to what I'm saying in hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours where I talk about human nature, right? If you want to figure that out and then you want to ask me a pointed question about something cool. Ask. Bring it. If it's something that's going to, if it's a, if it's a bark, if you want me to bark about something, I'm probably not going to bark about it

Speaker 3:          00:44:50       for what? Throwing you in a camp. All you'd have is a whole lot of unhappy

Speaker 1:          00:44:54       be campers. No, you throw me in a camp. If you put me in one camp, the other camp doesn't listen to anymore. Yeah. And that, and that means their minds are closed, so they're not going to, and is the fact of the matter is there's, there's good people in both camps know and, and both people can be, can be, can change and come can accept new ideas if their mind is open, if their mind is open, they're just staying there, camp and everyone else. I mean, when you watch the extremes of either camp right now, it's, it's like, it's like really, it's, it's bizarro world. That's kind of odd. Yeah. So you, you just sit there and say, okay, what, why am I going to play that game? Let's just become better people that understand people better and will make better, make the place, make the world better.

Speaker 3:          00:45:45       Can't disagree. Okay. Yeah. The whole unhappy campers though than me more than making a joke. I dig it. Yeah. No, it was a good attempt at humor. Well, actually, no, it wasn't. It was a failure, but that's cool. Oh, what was the other point you made? Uh, sometimes it's better to just, just try, you know, and, oh, the whatever thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I know. And then now, you know, don't try that again. No more jokes from Echo Charles. Learn from my mistakes. Anyway. Next question. What is the best way to break through a plateau in Jujitsu? I'm stuck doing the same moves against the same training partners that have the same moves done to me beating the same guys and getting beat by the same guys. What should I do? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:46:27       what should he do? Well, I'll tell you what I would do. Go on a crazy training binge. Yeah, take, take a week off from work and train eight hours a day. Just get crazy it. Make sure you're healthy and then take a week off and train eight hours a day. Like nuts. That's number one. Number two, you could also opposite. Take a short break, take a little time. Don't take a long break. Take a little step back. That's another option. Another option is only start working on certain moves. Like only utilize one, like, okay, so every time you get a arm lock from the bottom of you, you got to be, you're a guard player. Don't play golf anymore. Yeah. Don't click guardian more a start. Just look, I'm not going to play guard every time I'm going to come up and I'm going to get us, I'm going to go for a single leg from the bottom like dean does.

Speaker 1:          00:47:20       I'm gonna do that every time until I started making it work. That's what I'm going to do. And if I get choked a thousand times, that's fine cause I'm going to get better at it eventually. And other thing is trained, like, you know, you get your little click of training partners at your gym, starched the training with some of the other people that have different body styles and big different body shapes. So you get used to, you have to bring out a new part of your game. The first one that I talked about, training binge eight hours a day. I know it's hard for people to actually make that happen. The w the, The Times that I've done that, the first time I did it, I actually do is at the time that I taught the, uh, the Jocko, the Jujitsu for off fence, the Jujitsu offense for combat killing operations Jacko course.

Speaker 1:          00:48:05       And I trained these guys. It was a small group, it's like five of us and we trained all day and one of the guys was equivalent to me. Uh, Dan, he was like, we were both like blue belts. And so we normally, we were teaching people, but we were training long and like my Jujitsu visibly got better in a five day period because I trained super hard for five straight days. So that's a cool way. You could probably do it for a weekend, you know, probably just like a three, take a Friday off trade Friday, Saturday, Sunday, eight hours a day, work on some stuff. Yeah, be careful, you know, because you, you get your over use injuries and or do you get, when you're tired, you're more likely to get hurt. So you got to use a little caution. But yeah, those are some good ways to break your plateaus in Jujitsu, which we all, we all hit one way to know that you're breaking your plateaus, you're going to get worse first. You're gonna get, you're gonna lose, you're gonna lose to some of these guys that you have been tapping because you're trying something new. Yeah, yeah. That is an indicator for sure. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:49:04       The, I like the do certain moves or omit certain loose cause like it's a natural thing where like you, when you're, you're, when you're ascending, right? When you're getting, when you're training, you kind of settle into a certain type of game, you know? So maybe, yeah. You like to play guard a lot. Maybe like to get the triangle from the guard a lot. That's your kind of go to, you know, where it, it becomes sort of this almost like a muscle memory kind of thing where it's like boom, you'll pull guard your routine in a role no matter who you're going against it. It's real similar all the time. Right. Um, so yeah, if you start omitting that stuff where it's like, okay, I'm not, I won't go for that triangle anymore. I'll play guard, but it cannot do the triangle. So it forces you to do other stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:49:44       And then sometimes depending on your experience, you might have two, three, four go tos, right? So you still, you still kind of trapped in that same plateau by if you just omit one move. So in that case, you think of a move that you might notice other people getting a lot, not necessarily on you, but you know, just in general and be like, Hey, I'm, that's all I'm going to do. I can't get any other submission. I can't, I can only do, I don't know the Guillotine for example. Right. Let's say you just don't do guillotines that much or whatever. I know you can't relate to that, but you say, okay, I'm only going for guilty if I'm like in my guard. I can't really like, I can't really get a guilty tunes from the guard or whatever it put it this way. If you're not good at Guillotines, that'll force you to find ways to get the guilty. It'll just force

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       you. And then if you do that for one thing that we, I would say maybe even like three months, maybe in six months, Brian Sergeant was like, Hey, yeah, like I what I did I cause he liked, he likes to play on top, smashed from the top. He's like, I had it for six months. I just didn't play on top. Well that might've been you who said that? I Dunno. One of you guys said that that definitely happened with me. Yeah. It definitely happened with me. I didn't like being on the bottom. Yeah. And then I just had to just like, okay. Yeah. No sweeps allowed. Um, no, like starting from the top. If you're, if you're starting to pull guard, that's it. Like, no, that's your rule. And that's the thing. It's hard to like, it's hard to come to training unless you have this plan in your mindset.

Speaker 2:          00:51:08       It's hard to come to train and be like, you know what? I think I'm going to just only play guard today if like you don't like garden cause it's like I don't want to get like tapped out everybody, you know, especially when you just got your purple belt or something like this. It's hard to do that. But yeah, if you just make up your mind, kind of think of it long term, like I'm playing the long game here and just only go for that certain move that you want to get good at it. That's all you're doing. It'll, that'll bus you plot pass the plateau easy. It'll, I don't know about easy way to walk through your plateau, but I think that's a very high probability that you'll, you'll get past it. And also, uh, just not easy cause you just, it's more of your plastic plateau.

Speaker 2:          00:51:49       Easy. It's not easy. Yeah. But it was actually hard. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And I did, I just do, I just want to make sure people aren't like, Oh, you know, Echo said to just try one move and then it's going to be easy to break them. No, that's actually not true. That's actually hard to, it's a, it's hard to not just resort back to what you're good at and B, when you don't resort to what you're good at and you get your ass kicked on a regular basis, which is not fun and easy, and that easily could be the two main challenges of going through Jujitsu journeys. Those two things. Yeah. Arguably, yes, you are right. Correct. That is absolutely correct. If that's what you mean by easy, what a kind of sorta meant was you'll the probability of breaking pastors have surf spot that I surf at.

Speaker 2:          00:52:35       Yes. And one of the ways to get out of the water is dangerous book fast. The other way to get out of the water is mellow, but it's a longer walk and I was surfing with my buddy stoner and he's like, Hey, which way is it easier to get out? And I said, well Bro, it depends on which is why he's here. Yes sir. Because one of them's not more than a few steps. Once you're good. Yeah, we're getting good. Is getting to that point is it is a challenge. The other way is real easy, but it's a long walk. So it just depends what you mean by easy. Yeah. So I mean to me, probability wise, let's say if you chose to break through your plateau by going to another gym to

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       train with all different guys, that will get you past your plateau. But I think if you did this thing where you omit a certain move or you just add a move, they not good. And that's the only way if you did that and really committed to it correctly, which is hard by the way mentally. But if you did that, I think, I think you, the probability of you breaking pass your plateau and ending up at a further place in regards to progress is much higher if you did that. Yeah, that's what I think. And that's what I meant by easy, which I guess, yeah, that, Gosh, I'm gonna use the word easy. Depends what you mean by using scratch. Watch me also, uh, do tournament plenty. If you do a lot of tournaments, bro, you'll, you'll bus bus pass the plateau. Yeah. Weaknesses will be exposed. Yeah. And it's like you'll, you're mine would be way more at ease in training too. It'll be like more open. It's weird for sure. I think so. Anyway. Next question. How do you apply the principle of building a relationship with your boss when your boss doesn't value relationships, for example, he consistently avoids interactions that don't lead directly to a deliverable on a current objective. He avoids all other interactions such as those that are for the purpose of building relationships and chemistry within the team. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:39       What would I do in that situation? While the Nica obviously what I would do is I would build a relationship based on deliverable current objectives, right? If that's what he's into, I'm going to make that happen. Like I'm going to be the guy that he thinks can get this to happen and that's what our relationship is going to be based on and I'm fine with that. When he wants to talk about work, I will talk about work. I had bosses like that. I had plenty of bosses like that and what do you do when you have bosses like that and play the game like, okay, we're going to, let's just make this happen. Let's do this now let me say this beat beat because he isn't personable. This means that you have to be more personable, not so much with him but with the rest of the team because there is a lacking element within the team that you as a good team player and team member and leader, whether you're in a positional leadership or just a human leader, you can improve the team by building some of that human connection that bonds the team more so.

Speaker 1:          00:55:46       Even though my boss is in personable and is just about the business and just about the current objective, that's fine with me. I'm going to do my best to support him and make him realize that I'm going to got the guy that's going to make those objectives work and I'm going to build the human connection with the rest of the team which will make our team stronger. Now I am not going to offend my boss by being the guy that is more popular than him. Some people have some, some people that have the attitude that this individual's talking about, what would you call this person? Um, just just a hundred percent work focused. So if I've got a guy that's 100% work focused, sometimes that kind of boss finds the person that wants to chat. Annoying. Right? Unknowing which is possible. So you don't want wanna you don't want to be, you don't want to annoy the boss and he thinks all this, all this guy joggle he just wants to build friends. He's not here to work. No, you gotta be careful about that. And, and, and the weird thing is, honestly, I'm very work focused.

Speaker 4:          00:56:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:53       I'm very work focused and I have to like, I don't really have to do anymore, but I used to like, I'd have to consciously think about, okay, on top of, actually I still do have to do it. Sometimes you don't like, I have to consciously think about like, okay, I also need to like be nice and build relationship with the person that I don't normally interact with. Right? So you, you do have to do that. So form the relationship with the rest of the team, the good relationship, and then form the best relationship that you can with the boss and that is going to help the whole team. That's it. It's as simple as that. And I'll say one more thing about this.

Speaker 4:          00:57:32       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:57:33       You don't get to pick your leader generally. You don't get to pick your leader, but you can pick the relationship that you have with your leader. Yeah. So what your leaders into, let's get in the game. Let's build a good relationship. Uh, once again, if someone's out there thinking, oh, so you just want me to kiss ass. What I'm saying is not that I want you to kiss ass, I'm singing. I want you to win. That's what I'm saying. Because the better relationship you build with your boss, the more influence you have over them, the better chance you have of getting promoted, the better chance you have of of accomplishing the mission and taking care of your team. That's, that's the way it works. Why don't want to get promoted so I can get more money for myself. No, I want to get promoted so I can do the mission so I can take care of my team. That's why I want to get promoted. If it was just about like taking care of myself, I wouldn't go work for this guy. I'd go find another job and pick a different boss. Cause you do get to pick your boss, you can quit your job, quit your day job.

Speaker 1:          00:58:29       So that's what you do. You build that relationship hard as it is gets up. Yeah. That's a good point. With the d with the kind of the details of it where you can't just start trying to chat the guy up. He doesn't like that. Yeah. No one does actually. Yeah. Even if you're a social person, but you're for, let's say you're just focused on something, you know and I dunno, you focusing on in your friend calls you and you're like, oh well they called me. It might be important. Yeah, yeah. And they're telling you about, you know, the episode of whatever last night. And he was like, Bruh, I'm working right now, but I don't watch TV. Call me again. Oh yeah, now you're going to step step further than I had in mind. But I'm just saying that that's annoying no matter who you are. So if you're thinking, you know, this boss is like, he, he doesn't like to quote unquote build, build relationships and like all this stuff, he's only then you're going to, you written, you run that risk of annoying them. Yes. You've got to be a, make a big step back, dichotomy,

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       dichotomy, dichotomy. But there's little end. Usually it has to do with time too, you know? So if you go in and you just go, just little digs of like relationship building stuff but not, don't take, don't go in there and be like, hey did you catch the game last night? Didn't do that. Like I don't care. I can stop. But you know, I dunno. Nice tie, boom out, you know, kind of thing. I Dunno. Don't say nice to, I don't know. Next question. The guy that's high level worker does not want to hear about his tie is not care about his time. Yeah. But it actually is noise. A lot of people. But yeah. And I don't know how to get it in the corporate scenario. I think my whole life. But yes. So I don't know, that just seemed like something on the movies and long finger about your shirt.

Speaker 3:          01:00:06       No, it wasn't corporate though. The night club leadership. Yeah, same for sure. And the point is, there's things you can say that don't take up his time and necessarily his full attention to annoy him that you can say or do. That's what I'm saying. I don't know what that is cause I don't, I don't know. I don't work with you guys. Check. Next question. Hey Jocko, my boss is trying to implement. I say postulates highlighted my boss. I don't know why it's, it's highlighting all my bosses works man. Somebody was talking about on social media how you said, ps, you're like, I went to the grocery store, I got some peas, you know it's a variable. Then nonetheless, escalation. Sure my boss is trying to implement a process that I see the end result not being what is needed and I have proposed an alternative that is proven and will add value to the company. Do I give up trying to position to get the outcome we need or do I commit to help implement his process and wait for the outcome then try it again. It is a relatively small failure in the big picture outcome but would like some input on how to get the results we need longterm. Very cool question and

Speaker 1:          01:01:32       so yeah, you've got a scenario where your boss wants to do something, you know you got a better idea that will work better. What do you do? Well, first of all, any way that I can make my idea and his idea, that's what I'm gonna try and do. So you have to be careful, and again, I don't know what your boss might be an open minded person. If you've got a good leader, you go in there and say, hey boss, this is what you're trying to make happen. I think this will work better. And your boss May, Oh wow, that's a great, that's a great idea. You know what? Let's go with that. There's, there's leaders out there that make it happen. You're probably not asking this question. If you have that kind of boss, you're probably talking about someone that has a little bit more ego, thinks they thinks they know a little bit more and not really open minded to new ideas.

Speaker 1:          01:02:07       And that's why making your idea into his idea is going to be a better option. Don't try and force your idea. And one thing you do is you could, you could ask questions and I've talked about this before, but like you say something like, you know, hey, hey boss, I want to make sure that I'm supporting this and the best way possible. So I really want to understand this fully. So can you explain this here to me and why we're doing it like that. And then you know, you have a conversation with your boss and then you go, oh, and maybe your boss has some good points that you didn't understand. Or maybe that opens the door for you to say, Hey boss, the way that this other group is doing it is like this. Do you think we could try that? Or you say, if you want to eagle him up a little bit, it's like, hey boss, you know, I don't, I don't fully understand this.

Speaker 1:          01:02:49       You know, as well as you do. Could you just help me understand why we're doing it this way? And then once again, what you're doing is you're starting a conversation. If you can't get the message across in that indirect manner, you can be a little bit more direct, but be careful when you're direct with people. They dig in, man, they dig in, especially with anyone. If any kind of Edo Eagle, they dig in, you tell them your idea and they just, all of a sudden they, they come up with reasons not to do it and you have to be careful. That's why you have to use caution when you reveal your plan.

Speaker 1:          01:03:26       It's better to not even review it as a year plan. It's better to reveal it as like an idea and then let it become their plan. Don't reveal your emotions. Okay? Now if all that fails and this guy is just dead set in, hey, we're no, we're doing it my way. Shut up. Echo. We're not. We're not listening to your plan. We're doing it my way. Then what you do. Yeah, you go all in. You support it the best of your ability. You, you try and learn what they want. You try and execute what they want. You try and understand what they want better than anyone else, including him. So that way you go out, you execute, you know where all the weaknesses are. Now you learn and now you can come back with a better argument or a better seed to plant in their head.

Speaker 1:          01:04:05       Hey boss, I know your plan. It's working really, really well. And one thing that we could do to make it even better, I think, what do you think of this? If we did x, Y, z instead of x, Y, B, I think it might work a little bit better. What do you think? And then you, again, you, you plant this, you plant the team, and maybe, I mean, you plant the seed and maybe you can incorporate, you know, there's times where there's times where I did this, oh, that's what you want to do, boss. Cool. Got It. Yep. That's when we do go and do something. Same result, get the same result, would do it a different way. You know? It's the ask for better to ask for forgiveness than permission. Yeah. Then then parish. So sometimes it's like, it's like they began, we're going back to the idea of things that don't matter.

Speaker 1:          01:04:48       If my boss wants me to do it one way and I can do it just a little bit different and no one's gonna know and it's gonna be all good and our results going to be the better or the same. I'm probably just can be like, hey boss, I got it. And then hey bossy on the fly. We made a little call here, we went with a y, B or you know, Z da. Is that as EDB? I hope it's not, you know, bad. But here's the results by the way. We did an even shorter time than a boss goes, oh yeah, that's cool. It's no big deal. Cause he sees the results and he wants to take us a little bit credit forums. So again, what's this about? This is about building the relationship. So let me ask you this. This is, this is an important for good question to ask yourself.

Speaker 1:          01:05:28       Will, what will help the team more? What will help the team more? Will it help the team or to disrupt the relationship and undermine the boss? Will that, will that help the team? No. Will it help the team? If you create an antagonistic relationship with your boss, know that won't help your team. Will it help your team? If you build a relationship with your boss, if you unify the team, if you strengthen the team and you bring everyone together, will that help the team? Yes. It'll help the team. Will that build the relationship with your boss? Yes. It will build a relationship with your boss. If you have a better relationship with your boss, is your boss more likely to accept the influence that you're throwing at them? Yes, absolutely. So I think that's something you can ask yourself a lot is what I am trying to do, going to help the team or hurt the team.

Speaker 1:          01:06:19       And you actually have to look at those two in the long term, in the search term. Cause sometimes you do something that hurts the team right now and it'll help the team later. Like for instance, Hey, we're going to fire a guy. Everyone loves him, but, and it's going to disrupt the team, but longterm we'll be better off sometimes that works. Sometimes it's like we're going to fire this guy. Everyone loves him and it's going to be a longterm down. It's going to be a long term detriment that you made this call, so you have to check yourself and check what's going to help. The longterm, short term of the team is going to make it better. It's gonna make it worse in this case, trying to make your plan your boss's plan. If you can't, then support, build relationships and influence over the longterm, especially cause this guy very smart to mention that this is a relatively small failure, like this isn't a huge risk.

Speaker 1:          01:07:04       It doesn't he, you can. Hey boss, you know what? We got it done. Didn't quite go come the same way. Here's where we're going. So very good question and a question. Similar question. Yeah. This is why group this one together too. We had a couple of groups questions. This is one of them. Jocko. I was wondering what your advice is for disagreeing up the chain of command. Obviously this needs to be done with some tact I eat in private, not in front of others, but in those private conversations, how should one respectfully disagree? Again, again, similar question. A better technique than disagreeing is just to ask questions. You know, boss, Hey, I want to make sure I get this right. Can you explain it to me again? Can you, can you watch me do it right? So your boss actually sees what the problem is. Uh, that way you're, you're not being offensive. Hey boss, can you explain why you chose this course of action? I really want to learn from, from what you do, what you, the way you do it.

Speaker 1:          01:08:04       I again, does that sound like a kiss ass? Yes. Cause I'm exaggerating. You know what I mean? Hey boss, you're so incredibly smart. No, I'm not talking about that because bosses don't like kit. Ask us if she's, or at least good, good bosses don't actually even good bosses. They might keep their kiss asses around, but they don't respect him. So you don't gain influence by being a kiss ass. It's not a good situation. So I'm not talking about kissing ass, but you know, hey boss, I'm really want to understand this and make sure I understand it. Can you, can you explain to me why this is the best way to make this, to do this versus the other way? You know that's the kind of question that's not kissing ass. That's actually, you know what is actually legitimately wanting to know. Well like I legitimately want to know maybe what if we, instead of assuming that we know better than our boss, what if we assume that my boss knows better than me? Let's make that assumption. And if you communicate with that assumption then you're probably going to communicate in a much better way then communicating with the assumption that my boss is an idiot and I know better than him. Yeah. Which is not a good way to communicate. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:09:04       Funny when you eat, now that you kind of said that about the kiss ass guy, cause that comes up a lot cause I don't want to be kissed ass and yeah you don't, the kiss ass guy is the same thing as being friend zoned. You know what friends owned mean? I do. It's the same thing. Yeah. So like the girl, right? Typically it's the guy who gets friend zoned. Right. Cause he's like two nights. He's too nice. He's too whatever. He'll, it's, he's a, he's essentially a, you're like a brother to me. To me. Yes ma'am. That's what he is. So of course the girls going to keep them around for all this like good feeling superficially by the way mentioned launch, all that stuff, all the superficial stuff. He's not going to get anywhere of legitimacy with her actual decision makings if you translate that into the, you know, working environment or whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:09:48       Well yeah the boss, I mean a certain kind of boss just like a certain girl is going to keep a guy around for that reason. Certain boss is going to be like, yeah I'll keep him around. I feel a little bit bad even firing the guy like that a little bit cause he's just so nice to me and gives me all these compliments and even in, in a weird way I think the kiss ass guy kind of knows that too. You know, like how, why would he ever fire me even though it's not negative your job or whatever. Right. Um, because you know, he can't fire me. I'm just too nice to him. You know, there's that feeling is floating around is what I'm saying. But it's the same deal, right? Like it's too many compliments. You're too much of a yes man. I'll keep you around for very superficial reasons, but that's it brother. You don't get past.

Speaker 1:          01:10:28       Yeah, that's, and that's not a good place to be it. No, it's not sir. That's why I'm not saying kiss ass. And the way I just explained that of, of actually assuming that your boss knows more than you, isn't is a good way to approach the situation as opposed to approaching the situation. Like you know more than your boss. Why act like that dude, the outcome isn't going to be inferior. The outcome is inferior. The outcome of, of acting like your boss or assuming that your boss knows more than you know the outcome is you treat them with respect. Because the other way you could try and treat them with expects a respect, but inadvertently you sound like, you know, some people we talk about normal face, right? Some people they cannot even ask a question in an in a respectful way, right? They can't even, what was I saying over here?

Speaker 1:          01:11:17       They can't even say, you know, hey boss, can you explain this to me cause I really want to honor, they can't even say that. You know, hey boss, can you explain this to me because this doesn't make any sense. You know what I mean? Like they can't even, they can't even ask a question in a respectful way. Yeah. That's a skill you should master as a leader and as a follower, as a leader and as a follower. How to ask questions and respectful way. Lafe pointed this out. Lafe pointed out, we were talking about the fact of, of, I would say it's a story he's told a bunch of times of going through the kill house and he's in the back of the train and you shouldn't be in the back of the train. You should be somewhere where you can lead everyone. Cause when you in the back of the train, you don't know what's happening in the front of the train of assaulters.

Speaker 1:          01:12:00       A big group of people moving through gills and I didn't and he goes, you know, Jocko didn't say, Hey, stop doing that and do it this other way is that. He asked me questions and he's like, they were real questions. I wasn't like, Hey leaf, why the hell are you in the back of the train? Is that a respectful question? No, it's not a respectful question, but it's like, hey leaf w what are you doing in the back of the train? This is a respectful question. I, I'm actually assuming that maybe life who doesn't have the experience that I have, who's my subordinate as a platoon commander. To me, the big task unit commander, my assumption is not that I know more than him. My assumption is that he's got a reason for that. My assumption is that he knows more than me. Yeah. Which, well, this is one of the, one of Jordan Peterson's 12 rules for life.

Speaker 1:          01:12:41       It's like a, I think it's assumed the person that you're talking to knows more than you. What I'm saying is the same thing up and down the chain of command. You assume that your boss or your subordinate, no something that you don't know and if you can, if you can ask questions in that way, instead of asking questions, boss, what do we do in this for or life? Why are you doing that? Like why are you in the back of the train? That's stupid. No, it's like, Hey, wait, why are you in the back of the train? What do you, what does it, what is your purpose of being back there? I genuinely, genuinely want to know, and this isn't like, I'm not even saying I'm acting like that. I truly, genuinely want to know what the deal is. So make the assumption up and down the chain of command that your boss, your subordinate, knows more than you and then ask good questions with true, genuine curiosity that you want to know the answers to. It's a good way to go about it.

Speaker 1:          01:13:42       Next question. I'm a young warehouse manager. That takes ownership for anything and everything that goes wrong. This seems to offend like coworkers. How can I fix it? Um, okay. Classic Dichotomy. Leadership quest shred there. You've gone too far. That's what's happened. You've gone too far. So what you have to be do, what you have to do is don't be offensive. When you take ownership, when you take ownership, you can't be offensive. When you take ownership. Some people get offended by that. So when you say, Hey, you know what? This is mine, I got this. That bothers some people when you say, you know what, this is my fault and I'm going to fix it. That even that offend some people. What the tone? Just the tone of like, no, this is my fault. I got this. And you do that three days, three times, four times, five times and all of sudden cause oh what?

Speaker 1:          01:14:41       Everything's his fault and as he's got to fix everything they, he doesn't think I can fix it. Right. You can offend people with all kinds of stuff. You don't have to work very hard to offend people. I mean there's people get offended when you say something nice to him, you know what I mean? You know what I mean? I was watching, uh, I met, I met the ever seen the yoga dude that does like yoga videos. He's got red hair. His name was spears. I met him just randomly getting off a plane, but he's, he what? I spears or Sears? Sears. I think it's serious. Maybe speak, what'd I say? Spears. I don't know because I know the guy though. Yeah, he's very funny guy. Very cool guy. And I was, once I met him, I was laughing. I was checking out a couple of videos, but one of them was, you know how to be offended at all things.

Speaker 1:          01:15:36       And it's, it's, it's hilarious because that's exactly what people do. People, some people can get offended by anything. So that's what you got to watch out for. Even when you're taking ownership, people can actually be offended by that if you go too far. So instead of overtly stepping up and taking ownership in this particular case, then you can tell what's going on here. My brother here, young warehouse manager, he's fired up. He wants to make things happen. He wants to get after it, and so what does he do? He's like, Oh, I read extreme ownership. I'm going to take ownership of everything, and that's a great attitude to have except for you can offend people when you go too far because you got to read the second book that I got into leadership so that you can, you can balance that out a little bit.

Speaker 1:          01:16:20       So instead of saying like, Hey, this is mine, I'm going to take ownership of this and make it happen. Instead you look and you say, Hey, you know what? Do you want me to take care of this? Oh, hey, you know what? That's probably in my department. You want me to take care of that? So that way or like, hey, it seems like this should be something I should take care of. You want me to handle that instead of me, me, me, me. I got to ask the question the other day at a Q and a in the core, the question started off with the person started the question with, I've got the mode, I've got the question that everyone in here needs answered. So, so, so out of the gate I was like, okay, so we have a situation here, right? Because that immediately tells you that in that person's head they've got, they've got the question that needs answered.

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       So there's already an ego scenario happening like out of the gate. So same thing here. You don't know if you're going to touch someone's Egos, right? So when you say, look, this is my deal and I'm going to fix it. Like some people will take offense to that. So again, you soften those a little bit. Try and give credit up the chain of command, right? Try and give it credit down the chain of command instead of all take ownership. It's like, hey, we got w, what did you say? We when, when credit gets doled out, get past that credit on, pass it to your peers passage, your subordinates, pass it to your boss. So that's it. Take ownership. What you need to do at this point, young man, is take ownership of being offensive. And when you do that, you're going to be less offensive. You're going to be more covert. A guests, remember I said earlier, like you don't get to pick the boss. You, you don't get to pick your boss, you, but you get to pick the relationship you have with it. You don't get to pick your, your peers. You don't get to pick your subordinates. You get your team,

Speaker 1:          01:18:15       okay. Hey, can you pick them? Yes, you can quit your job. Can you hire the right people? Yes you can, but look what you got is what you've got. You've got to work with them. You don't everyone up, man. I wish everyone was more fired up like I am. Like, that's not going to go well. You know, it's great that you wish that that's not going to go well. What you have to do is you gotta you gotta, you gotta.

Speaker 1:          01:18:38       Here's another one. This is similar, right? Millennials. Well, Hey, one of the things that, what are the things, this is a very simple, I've done, I've done the millennium questions a thousand times and you know, the Vietnam veterans, the Vietnam draft, these compared to them like, hey, we can talk about that again. We don't need to. But if you've got a, if you're in charge of millennials and you think to yourself, millennials thinks everything's, they think everything centers around them. What, what do you do as a leader? You know what I do as a leader? I make everything centered around them and then they perform and then they get after it. And as they grow up, they learned that everything doesn't send around them. But I bring them there. But why? Because I formed a relationship. Why? Because I listened to him. Why? Because I understand them.

Speaker 4:          01:19:21       Hmm. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:19:23       So you don't get the team that you want. You don't get the boss that you want. What you do is you play the game up and down the chain of command and form relationships up and down the chain of command that you want. What relationships do you want from up the chain of command? You want them to listen to you. You want them to give you what you need. Do you want them to get out of your way and let you do the mission? What about down the chain of command? You want them to support what's happening. You want them to get after their job. You want them to step up and lead. That's what you want. If you have an antagonistic relationship because your millennials think everything's about them, well then guess what? You're not going to be able to have any influence on them. Any real influence. You can have the imposed will on them

Speaker 4:          01:20:04       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:20:05       but the imposed will is a is a paper tiger, right? It's not real. It only lasts when you're there and guess what they're doing. They're looking for another job. So take ownership of being offensive and be less offensive and more covert. And you know what bro? Young warehouse manager keep getting after it and it will pay off. And the fact that you're fired up and you're crushing it, crush it with a little bit more tact and you're going to one day you're going to be making it happen. Yeah. We got time for one more question. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:20:42       To add though, a little tip, I think that, I think you taught this too actually. I realized this one I embraced extreme ownership. You can't say, Hey, I'm going to take extreme ownership of this. Like it's, it's one of those things, it's like just like taking the high ground, right? You get in like a thing with somebody, you can't say I'm going to do it, take the high ground and then it doesn't work like that. Like it just gave them the high ground. When you announced that you were taking the high ground, gave it up exactly the right. Same thing. We've picked stream partnership in the situation, so if you're a very good point, I get it man, when you're like, you know I'm taking, and he even said I take ownership of anything and everything that goes wrong. Anything like straight up, he's your guy. Right? Solely, it might indicate, I'm not saying he's doing this, but he could be going, hey guys, no worries. I'm taking extreme ownership of this situation. You know, like if you say that kind of stuff. Yeah, I could see that would,

Speaker 1:          01:21:30       but what's odd, and this is a very good thing to understand about human nature, everyone's jealous of you. Everyone's jealous of each other. Everyone's jealous of everyone else. No one wants you to win. Right. It's just like, so when this guy is stepping up and the crowd starts to pick at them, they start to pick at them and didn't want to pick them. They want to pull them apart. That's generally what the crowd wants to do to you. When you step up, when you elevate yourself, generally crowd wants to pick it you or pull you back down. Does he think he is? Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So if you were aware of that, then you can combat it by when instead of elevating yourself in an overt manner where everyone can see you saying, I'm going to take ownership this right now and get it solved. No use. If I can say, hey, you know what? This is probably my fault. Do you? Do you want me to? I've let me. Let me try and take some time and get it fixed. Everyone goes there actually kind of happy. They're like, yeah, it was your fault. They kind of, they're kind of like, it's okay with them, whereas opposed to I'm going to take ownership and there's this dichotomy of leadership. You're read extreme ownership. Awesome. You got to read dichotomy to push.

Speaker 3:          01:22:44       When something goes wrong, I freeze up opposite of the know, like I freeze up, I get stagnant. I don't want to move. I just asked myself, why me? I've tried saying good, but it's not getting me moving forward.

Speaker 1:          01:22:59       Any advice you ask yourself? Why me? So saying good. That should fix your attitude, but that alone, that alone will not fix your problems. If you're having problems. Sure. Say Good, that's perfect, but then don't ask yourself, why me? Instead ask yourself, now what am I going to do about it? What are you going to do about? Ask yourself that question and then figure it out. Figure out what you're going to do. Say to yourself, I am going to detach. I am going to assess the situation. I am going to come up with a plan and I am going to execute and then start moving. It's, it's not going to be a perfect plan, but take action action that moved you in a positive direction. And if it ends up being the wrong direction, that's fine. At least you've learned where not to go. Now, where this gets tough is if it is something that seems like it's completely out of your control and you know what? Some things are completely out of your control and that's fine. And when that happens, you ask yourself, what can I control? What can I control that will make this situation a little bit better?

Speaker 1:          01:25:10       And then you go, don't get crushed by things going wrong. Ask Yourself, what am I going to do? And then go do it. And I think that's all I've got for tonight. So Echo Charles, speaking of, uh, moving in the right direction, I know you've got some things that can help us move in the right direction. What do you got for us? Yeah. Okay, so dude, you did too. That's it. That's a good one. So still the path has what Ma many directions, but it's all in the same general direction. It's the improvement. It's improvement. There's different roads on the path. Yes. Which is a really

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       weird thing to say. Yeah. It's more of a general thing anyway, but do you just do the universal, in my opinion, I am assuming in your opinion to where if you're not doing Jujitsu more so than I would say like that's terrible. I'm not going to say that, but I'm saying if you go through life and not do Jujitsu and you're on the path, you might be left maybe missing out. You know what's really cool about this podcast? Yes. And about people listening this podcast and about people starting Jujitsu, this is the coolest thing. Two years ago I would've been like, hey, you know, you should try Jujitsu. It's really good. But I couldn't like confirm how universal so many people, I just, so many people after they take their first class or the first nine classes or first three classes, they were like, I'm addicted.

Speaker 2:          01:26:54       Yeah. Why is that? Because there's something special about Jujitsu, so you should train it. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. When you can draw them. The parallel of Meta, it's the metaphor for life. [inaudible] told me that early on actually, you know we're interested with David Maister philosopher. They didn't have to take philosopher and undergo val illustrated some points in a big one that undergo val said that I will never forget. It's like you through his, like his life, so considered Jujitsu. Like if you turn your back on your problems in Jujitsu, they're going to get worse and let's face it. That's in especially early on. That's how you get a guy to turn. That's how you get a choke, right when you're mounted on somebody, he slapped him in the face. What and why? If you get slapped in the face of what do you want to do, turn your back, right?

Speaker 2:          01:27:32       Like, Oh, don't stop my face. That's how you get the choke. So under law says and Juditha you turn your back and you give your back to your opponent. That's the worst thing you can do. But it's hard to face some. Usually you got to work, you know, same thing in life. Men turn your back on your problems, those problems and to get you, and you've heard me say that at the monster. Yes. You turn your back on your problems, they don't go away, they actually get worse. And it's the same exact thing in Jujitsu. Joke you. Yes. Getting per Jagers behind your back. So it's cool now to get feedback from thousands of people that have now gotten into Jujitsu game. And the feedback I've got probably I think three people out of many, many. And this isn't one of yours where you say like a lot of people and it's like four.

Speaker 2:          01:28:19       I'm talking to thousands of people. I've gotten three that don't like Jujitsu. Hmm. That does. They just don't like it. And that's why I came up with a rule. Okay. If you don't like it, that's fine. Train at least until you've submitted someone that's kind of equivalent and then you can stop. And the reason I think, I think that's actually, once you do that, you'll, you'll understand you too. Cause sometimes you just don't even understand it. Sometimes people just can't comprehend it. They count cock can't comprehend what's happening and it's just too much. Yeah, it's too much. Yeah. And so they don't want to do it. Yeah. But if you do it long enough that you submit someone, then you get that little like wow. It's incredible. Like at the muster when you,

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       when you show the connection of two moves, yeah, this I could go, it's like amazing. Oh yeah. And then when you try to explain that every move is connected that way because that's a biggie network. But, but people don't understand that Jujitsu is not just moves, that it's all this group thing together. This symphony of movement language. That was good. Anyway. When you do it, you're going to need a g cause you're going to do [inaudible] and no Gaeton Suki and rash card. That's the uniform. We'll call it a uniform. Sure. So you got to origin cause you're going to get an origin g it's the best one. Origin, main.com or just sometimes we forget to say that, which is not good. I feel like, I forget to say that the name is origin. We, I say origin Maine. Oh, okay, cool. But you'll, yeah, you'll, you'll come to realize that it's very obvious that origin is the only kind of gate that you'll want slash need all made in America by the way.

Speaker 1:          01:30:02       The threads are me. Throw that out there and just like, oh by the way, like it's made America, no, it's not just something you throw out there. It's a big deal. We're talking about Allume multiple. I actually, I actually had this, uh, so I was talking to is actually my literary agent and I was like, well, you know, like I said, it turns out, um, you know, they're not going, they can't put out Mike in the dragons before November. So I'm just going to, you know, Miss, make this book myself, I'm starting a publishing company. Yeah. And she's like, well, you know, a lot of people try that. But you know it's, there's a lot more to it, you know, it's really hard. Yeah. And I was like, okay, cool. Do you know what a Loomis I go, my friends up in Maine brought a loom back from the grave and weave material from cotton and nylon does so together.

Speaker 1:          01:30:54       The loom 9,000 [inaudible] is 9,000 pounds. Their, it has 5 million threads in going into it. It's got, it's got millions of parts inside of it. It was rusted. You're gonna tell me we can't get photocopy some stuff and put it out in the book. I got this, I got this. Don't, don't. And it's funny cause I told that to Brian and Pete. I was, I was laughing so hard because, because really what's, what, I don't even know if I could think of something harder than saying, oh, we're going to drag a loom out of a dam abandoned factory in Lewiston, Maine, one loom left. The rest of them have been sent overseas during the economic downturn. Oh, we'll just, we'll just outsource, nevermind. Outsource. We're just going to send our bread and butter our American hardware overseas and let someone else make it. There was one loom left. And guess what? We got it origin. But yeah. So you're telling me that we can take this old loom that's 30 years old that hasn't been run, that's rusted and dirty and abandoned and bring that thing back to life. You're telling me we can't print some books and get 'em out to my people. You're wrong. Watch me straight up wrong. Get some Jocko publishing.

Speaker 1:          01:32:08       Yup.

Speaker 3:          01:32:09       And that loom does not only make Giza and rash guards, by the way, multiple looms. By the way. It wasn't just that they know it was one lumen forsee in with yes. And now there's three looms. Rocking and rolling. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, you can get shirts and joggers and sweats, sweats, uh, named

Speaker 1:          01:32:28       named,

Speaker 3:          01:32:29       I dunno, but named, we'll say named the most comfortable sweats, sweats in the world. Straight up the joggers. I proclaimed straight up mill, most comfortable pencil world. None the less. Find out for yourself anyway. Or did you mean.com to make a lot of cool, good stuff. All made in America, by the way.

Speaker 1:          01:32:44       Yeah. And that includes in America supplements, Jocko, Jocko supplements. You know the Jocko thing is just to complete a lack of originality. That's what it is. Because when you think about it from a broader perspective, and you know me well enough to be like, the last thing I would do is like, oh, I'm just going to call everything Jocko. It's like bizarro though. When you started with the podcast, it started with Jocko podcast and that, I've said this before, but I was on Tim Ferriss's podcast and he was, he said like, are you hungry? And I was like, Jocko hungry. Yeah. And for some reason that just made me chuckle. And then when we were naming this podcast, I was like, well, you're like, what are you gonna call him? Like Jocko podcasts as if it's the same knee Andra fall things. And so then, then it was like, okay, we're going to make tea.

Speaker 1:          01:33:38       Well, what do you call pomegranate white tea? What are we going to call it? Like the vedic solution. I mean, we didn't get to call it. It's like, okay, well this, it's going to be the tea that I drink, so we'll just called Jocko white tea. Okay, cool. Well then, hey, when I, when I, when I started saying, you know what, I need to make some good supplements, Pete and Brian in the game, like I'm like, Hey, can you make this? And they're like, yeah. And I said, okay, well then what are we going to call it? We'll just call it, you know, so I'll go Jocko. Supercross and there you go. So that's how we ended up with the least creative name of any products that have existed. I apologize to everyone

Speaker 3:          01:34:18       actually. It seemed like, well, early on anyway, it seemed like it wasn't creative because you're like, hey, this create, like if I create this super creative name, like is that important? Really great now. No,

Speaker 1:          01:34:27       I'm too busy making it good. Cool. We talked about in the last podcast that sometimes I'm so into functionality, yeah. That I don't need, that I'm not in, in synchronicity with the rest of the world. Sometimes. For instance, if you allowed me to design a house, no human being would live in the house except for me and like three other seals that I know that'd be like, Oh yeah, this house is perfect. Right? Everyone else to be like, Bro, what is wrong with you? He said, you know you have keep that same with vehicles. Like if I could design my own vehicle, no one would want to drive. It bumped me. Maybe that's, that one may be a little bit broader because you get people that'd be like year or so. I have to be careful because sometimes I'm just so into function that it just doesn't make sense to anyone else but me.

Speaker 3:          01:35:16       Yeah, but it does have its value big time when it comes to these supplements because what joint warfare function, try lose function and your joint and see what happens. Same thing with Krill oil. Same thing with discipline, brain function, and then of course milk. That's muscle function and muscle building function recovery, if you will still look all of them together, brain function, joint function, muscle function,

Speaker 1:          01:35:39       boom. You're good to go. Yeah. Yeah. And speaking of functionality, and this is one of the things where you kind of attacked me, sir, you attacked me because for you, you see this is, this is a perfect example in your mind. I'm all about function. Right. Then when I started making supplements, I wanted them to taste good and that was actually, it was actually side by side with functionality is taste. Why is that? Because if you don't, if it doesn't taste good, then it's not gonna function cause you're not going to use it. Yeah. So these tastes delish yeah, especially mark. Let's face the facts. There's a whole new thing. Yeah. It's, it's literally a new thing in the world. We had to create, I create a name for it. Milk. Why did I create that name? What else are you going to call? It doesn't make sense to call it anything else because there's not anything else.

Speaker 1:          01:36:33       It just is more, that's what it is now. Okay. I got four kids. We know I have four kids. I spend time with kids. I see kids all the time. We got kids Jujitsu programs at my gym. What do kids need? Kids need fuel. What do kids get fed? They get fed crap. Why? Because there's, there's sugar in everything. There's high fructose corn syrup, Corn Syrup and everything. There's just garbage. So with my own kids, what do I want to feed them? I want to feed them something that's good. We made warrior kid milk. Why? Because kids need good food. Eat. We're, we're putting kids on the warrior path. I get letters every single day from kids all over the world. New Zealand, Australia, Europe, America, for sure. Kids that are seven years old that are nine years old, that are 11 years old, that are 14 years old. And they're on the path. They're doing pull ups, they're doing Jujitsu, they're sending pictures of their Jujitsu tournament. They're drawing pictures of their metal that they got for Jujitsu. You know, there's kids that are on the warrior kid path. What are they eating? Are they eating junk? Sometimes they're eating junk. Not because they want to, but that's because what's, that's what's in their fridge. So had to solve that problem. So we made warrior kid milk again. What was equivalent to functionality. The function was they need protein, they need vitamins,

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       any probiotics, functional part side by side with that had to taste good. Yeah. Had to taste good. And what do we end up with? Warrior kid milk, chocolate and strawberry. It's freaking delicious. Both of them. They're so good. They're so tasty. It's ridiculous. So that's where your kid milk that's available from origin main.com. We're going to try and get that one out to the masses. Every kid needs or your kid walk instead of drinking some sugar fold crap of fillers, we're going to give you real food going to make you stronger or soda. Yeah man. I used to, uh, we never had thought of growing up in my house, but I used to go to my friend's house name is Eric Masters. He's a pilot from the air force, by the way. Um, so I go to his house and they'd have, so he didn't, he didn't, wasn't pounding.

Speaker 2:          01:38:52       So it all the time is a superior athlete. Oh, this guy. But they had cylinder kind of above the thing. Wait. So when I was a kid, we didn't even relate. Like soda wasn't bad for you. We just were like, oh, this is just, this is just how like, oh, we just jumped clear. I'm thirsty. I'm going to drink a coke and mentos or your Fridays to drink. Joke about that. Like when you were a kid, like, oh, I haven't drinken anything all day. I'm really thirsty. Give me a coke. Yeah, you just drank it. Exactly right. And that's the, you didn't know that there was 36 grams of corn syrup in there. It's a, yeah, good job. Thinking back, I'm like, Dang, that is a crazy, crazy. What could you imagine? And you only weighed 48 pounds. It wasn't like, it wasn't like you're a 225 pound grown man.

Speaker 2:          01:39:32       I'm like, I am right now. I could probably put down a coke and it wouldn't character, but you're, you're nine years old here. Get some of that wrong. Some grape crush pineapple. So many. I cut you off and do and, and Mr Masters snow. Yeah, but no, that was that. That's the point where you're going, it's just that, that's just how, Oh yeah, grab a soda after school, whatever. They'd sell sodas for 50 cents after our school. You go in the thing, you buy the soda, whatever, Soda Machine, whatever. What if it was Marketo? Oh, way better. Way Better. Cause it tastes just as good if actually it tastes better than soda because on for sure undeniable and your, yeah, that'd be just be way better. So there you go. Where your kids Moke Moke for the adults. And then the other funny thing was I had all the people send in pictures of their kids drinking before we had warrior kid mortgage. The kids were just straight up going down the milk, train themselves. Little Kid's two years old, three years old, four years old, little kids drinking milk. I would get the warrior kid mock a little less protein. Yeah. Tasty as can be vitamins, probiotics. Just good to go. Way to go. 100%. Yeah, totally good to go. We're going to change the world with that one. Going to make it strong again. Also if you want to represent, we got some shirts for you, go to Jocko, store.com that's where you can get this Lind equals freedom.

Speaker 1:          01:40:55       A shirt with Jockos head on it that I made with the word good written. You also get a shirt with echos head on it that Jocko made, which have been now captured in the wild. People representing. Yes. Then that made me feel really, really good. Really? Oh, so you kind of got off on that. That was like really cool. Like Oh, I got fans there. Of course there's that. Put it this way for someone to represent that hardcore, don't wear that shirt because it's a cool design. I like it. And then you know, for them that was a little, everyone seemed really handle compliment my direction because I designed it. Yeah. Everyone seem real happy with them saying the whole group, you know, there's some layers on that shirt. Yeah. Massive multiple layers nonetheless. Some cool stuff on there. We've got some hoodies on there. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:42:33       They want to hear it from Uncle Jake. Yeah. They want to hear it from Uncle Jake and I would go so far as to say don't even one of the, you know, you said you can't just say, oh, I'm going to take extreme ownership of that. Yeah. What you can do with your kids is turned round. When you're in the car and say you see Uncle Jake saying the same thing I told you. Yeah, you know, don't do that. Don't get, don't, don't discredit uncle Jake and you're not really discrediting him, but what you're doing is you're bringing your, you're forming a team, right? You're forming a team. It's us against you. And when Uncle Jake's talking to the kid, they're on the same teeth and team. Uncle Jake is in the game with the kids, the kids, you have a natural friction with your parents. If you take uncle Jake side strongly, now you're on uncle channel.

Speaker 1:          01:43:21       It's you against your kids against, you don't want that. You should almost play reverse psychology and be like, well, you know, it's a little extreme for uncle Jake to want to work out that much. And your kid be like, well, I think we should probably listen to Uncle Jake Dad. Maybe. Maybe we should get a pull up bar. By the way, get a pull up bar for your kids. Just get a pull up bar form you. It doesn't cost much. It costs 12 bucks. You just need a piece of pipe and you just hang it somewhere for your kids so they can do pull, pull ups are important for children. Yeah. Straight up. There's some fact about no kid that can do a pull up is obese in the whole world. You can't be obese and do a pull up as a kid thing. That's good. So let's do some pull ups.

Speaker 1:          01:44:10       listen. Oh yeah, don't do that. Yeah. You want the kids you want, it's like when you go through military bootcamp, the drill, the drill instructors are real mean cause they want you to form a gang against them. That's part of the psychologies. They want it to be us against them. So we form up into a platoon and we're against this guy and then in the end it all comes together. Same thing we're going here. We you don't you want to let Uncle Jake be part of their team and you just man of stuff. Uncle Jake says, man, he seems like a pretty intense guy. Oh, and actually uncle Jake isn't that intense on the warrior could podcast? No, he's telling stories about being a kid. Yeah. He's answering questions about being a kid.

Speaker 3:          01:44:56       Yeah. I guess it's soft or not softer, but like he's not as, he's more intense than the book

That's, it was like almost second was going to have some mutek kicking like a white dude took them. Well there's the dichotomy in that too. Sure. It tastes good.

Guess what kind of tissue drinks Jokowi's yeah, so obviously she did that. We're sending shipments of Jocko white tea to England. So she believes it. The, the, the, the damn world. Global home of tea. Yeah there were having to ship it because you bought your thing was always the cold, the ice tea? No half the warranty. So you oh you mean as far as like before you made Jocko white tea you, I'd always see you drinking the cold one most. Most of the time. Most of the time I prefer cold cause most of the time I'm in a situation where I'm hot and I need to cool down. Sometimes I'm in a situation where I'm cool and I need to warm up and when he wants to sell them, when you cold you want to be cozy.

Speaker 2:          01:48:49       But I mean I'm saying Brits, they don't dig the cold Ice Tea. That's why. Well, you know what's nice is like before you have to talk a lot.
