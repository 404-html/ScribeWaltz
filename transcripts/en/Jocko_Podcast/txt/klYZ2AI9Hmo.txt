Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number one oh nine with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening.

Speaker 2:          00:00:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:10       One September, 1942 the army in the field, comrade fighters, commanders and political workers. Heroic defenders of Stalin Grad, the bitter fighting for the city of Stalin Grad has been raging for months. The Germans have lost hundreds of tanks and planes. Hitler's brutalized hordes are advancing toward Stalin Grad and the Volga over mountains of dead bodies of their own men and officers are Bolshevik party. Our nation, our great country have given us the task not to let the enemy reach the Bolga to disturb to defend the city of Stalin Grad. The Defensive Stalin Grad is of decisive importance for the whole Soviet front.

Speaker 2:          00:01:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       Without sparing our strength and with scorn for death, we shall defy the Germans the way to the Volga and not give up Stalin Grad. Each one of us must bear in mind that the capture of Stalin Grad by the Germans and their advanced to the vulgar, we'll give our enemies new strength and weaken our own forces, not one step back.

Speaker 2:          00:01:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:26       The war council expects on unlimited courage, tenacity, and heroism in the fight with the onrushing enemy from all the fighters, commanders, and political workers from all the defenders and Stalin, Groton, the enemy must and will be smashed on the approaches to Stalin Grad.

Speaker 2:          00:01:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:48       Forward against the enemy up into the unremitting battle comrades for Stalin Grad for our great country death to the German invader.

Speaker 2:          00:02:03       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:02:05       so that is a clearly a note from the general on the ground. The member of the war council of the Stalin Grodd and southwest front Lieutenant General Khrushchev sent to the troops obviously that we're preparing to defend Stalin Grad.

Speaker 2:          00:02:28       Now

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       there was another commander in the field by the name of Paulus and he sent a note to Hitler on 23 November, 1942 my fear since receipt of your radio message of evening 20 to 101 events have come thick and fast. We have not succeeded in closing the pocket to the southwest and West. In pending enemy penetrations begin emerge there. Ammunition and fuel are coming to an end. Numerous batteries and tanks have shot themselves dry. A timely and adequate supply is impossible. The army will shortly be destroyed unless a concentration of forces succeeds and totally defeating the enemy attacking from the south and west. For this, we must immediately withdraw all forces from Stalin, Grad and strong detachments from the northern front. Unavoidable sequel must then be a breakout towards the southwest since eastern and northern front can no longer be held with such weak forces. In this case, we will lose much material, but the majority of the valuable combatants and at least a part of the material will be preserved.

Speaker 2:          00:03:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:49       I retained full responsibility for this message even if I add that commanding generals heights, Strecker, Hubei, Jack Mill, von side. Let's all share this evaluation of the situation based on the situation. I again request freedom of action. Hi, my fure signed Paulus, so the Russians were effective in surrounding the Germans, the German sixth army. As a matter of fact, 250 to 300,000 men fully surrounded now by the Russians.

Speaker 2:          00:04:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:28       Here's what Hitler wrote back. Six army has been temporarily and circled by Russian forces. I intend to concentrate the army in the area, Stalin Grad, north coat lube on hill one 37 hill one 35 Marineau Fucka Zit Benko stolid Grad south. The army may rest assured that I will do everything to bring supplies to it accordingly and relieve it in time. I know the brave six army and its commander and chief and I am sure it will do its duty, signed Adolph Hitler.

Speaker 1:          00:05:08       So, and we'll get into this. Hitler over and over again is asked if the troops on the ground can try and escape from Stalin Grad and over an over again. He says, no, you cannot leave. You will fight to the last bullet. And on the 30th of January, 1943 Hermann goring, who was the Nazi Reich's marshal of the entire German racks, or he's this senior military man of the entire German army from 1940 until the end of the war. And even though Stalin Grad had not fallen yet, he gave this speech about their sacrifice of these German soldiers and he gave it, it was obviously heard on the radio, et Cetera. And it's spread. And actually the soldiers on the ground in Stalin Grad, the German soldiers heard this speech, and again, we'll get more to what the reactions were, but I'm going to read that part of that speech right now. It made one shutter, but Stalin had enormous masses at his disposal and used old men, women and children, and did not bother about supplies are sufficient. Food or transport. The Russians used the whip or the bullet.

Speaker 1:          00:06:34       The Germans alone could resist and could wrestle with such an adversary. Everything depended on them with the greatest respect to other nations. The Germans are the only ones in Europe in a position to break Russia and destroy bolshevism of all the terrific battles. The battle for Stalin Grad stood out like a gigantic monument, which would one day be regarded as the greatest and most heroic battle in German history. So he's referring to this in the past tense. Once again, this, this hasn't been, this hadn't finished yet, but he's referring to it like it's in the past tense because for all practical purposes, it was back to the document. Every German soldier would come to pronounce the word stolen grind with holy awe and remember that it was there that germ Germany set this seal of final victory because people that fought like that must win.

Speaker 1:          00:07:33       Germany has now become the guarantor of European freedom, culture and life. But for the fighters of Stalin Grad, the Russians might have obtained their objective. Now they are too late. The defenders of styling rod had obeyed the law, which everyone must obey the law to die. For Germany, this law was not only binding on soldiers, but on the whole German nation. The Nation must not question whether it's stand at Stalingrad has been necessary or not. The law had ordered them to do so. So here the saying don't question one question. The sacrifice of 250,000 men don't question it. It was of no concern to the German soldier whether he died at stolen rod in the African desert or Norway. He always sacrificed himself so that his nation might live in ours when some people perhaps tried to install more bid and sly thoughts into your brains than we must always look at. The fear they're shining. And greatest example, they could believe that the Almighty had led this man, a God sent man to pass through innumerable dangers and become greater and greater all for nothing that providence had given them, this man who had made them into the strongest nation in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:09:07       These are guarantees that justify our belief in victory. So we're talking about Hitler here, by the way, as a God sent Ma'am in difficult times are real leaders tested and people prove their worth in hard trials. I, the commander in chief of the loof [inaudible] suffered exceptionally when I heard of the results of the bombings, and although I did my best to prevent it from happening, it must be recognized as unavoidable and must not influence our will for resistance. We know a tremendous heroic song from a match without equal that was called the battle of the need loans. They too stood in a hall of fire and fire quenching their thirst with their own blood, but fought and fought to the last such a fight is raging there today because of people who can fight like that must win. And before these men,

Speaker 2:          00:10:16       a millennia

Speaker 1:          00:10:17       previous there stood in a small gorge in Greece and infinitely brave and daring man with his 300 Leah nineties stood with 300 Spartans from a tribe known for it's bravery and boldness and an overwhelmingly numerical superior enemy attacked and attacked and attacked again and again. Even then, it was a rush from the Asian east against the Nordic people. Huge numbers of men were available to Xerxes, but the 300 men did not waver or falter, fighting a losing battle, hopeless but not meaningless. And then the last man fell. And in this bottle neck there is a sentence

Speaker 2:          00:11:08       wanderer.

Speaker 1:          00:11:10       If you come to Sparta report that you had seen us lying here as the law commanded, they were 300 men. My comrades and Millennia have passed. But today that battle, that sacrifice still counts as the greatest example of heroic soldiering. And today this fight is there. This sacrifice is there and stolen Grodd and one day it will be sad if you go to Germany, tell them you have seen us lying in stolen grog as the law commanded us to protect the security of our people. And as I said, those were the words of Herman goring, who was the senior officer of the German military.

Speaker 2:          00:12:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:06       At that time. And those were his words. And of course his words were lies.

Speaker 2:          00:12:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:19       All of them were lies and no one knew that better than the men on the ground.

Speaker 2:          00:12:24       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:12:25       In and around the Russian city of Stalin Rod nearly 1500 miles away from Berlin, freezing, starving, surrounded low on ammunition, lacking medical supplies, and lacking cold weather gear and lacking any kind of real leadership. And they also serve the intonation that lacked the moral high ground.

Speaker 2:          00:12:53       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:12:53       Does it matter of fact, their nation's leaders lacked any kind of morality to all, and this is clear in the aggression that they unleashed in the world and the atrocities that they committed in mass murder of millions of people. And it's clear that they had no morality whatsoever based on how they treated their own soldiers.

Speaker 2:          00:13:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:17       Who, like many soldiers were men that were fighting not for political powers or for political ideals, created an an ivory tower, thousands of miles away from them. But for the ideals of a soldier himself, duty and courage and honor, that's what soldiers fight for. Ed.

Speaker 2:          00:13:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:49       The ultimate thing that they fight for as we have heard time and time again, is for their brothers on the line with them to their left and to their right. And one of those men was named Yo Hakim

Speaker 2:          00:14:11       weeder.

Speaker 1:          00:14:12       He was an intelligence officer in the eighth corps of the German six army. And he wrote about his experiences in a book called Stolen Gorod memories of hell

Speaker 2:          00:14:26       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:26       Where he recalls what he and other German soldiers went through physically, mentally,

Speaker 2:          00:14:33       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:34       And spiritually.

Speaker 2:          00:14:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:38       As they were abandoned by their leaders as they were abandoned by life.

Speaker 2:          00:14:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:49       And as they were abandoned. Bye. Hope itself.

Speaker 3:          00:14:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:59       Let's go to the book again. This is your Keem weeder.

Speaker 3:          00:15:14       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:15       And the book is called Stolen Grodd memories of hell.

Speaker 3:          00:15:20       No.

Speaker 1:          00:15:21       After meticulous preparations of gigantic proportions, the Russians with they're overwhelmingly superior armor and cavalry forces attacking like lightning from the north. And the following day from the east press star entire sits sixth army into an iron vice. Within three days, the encircling ring was closed at collage on the Dan and Co on the dawn and constantly reinforced.

Speaker 3:          00:15:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:46       Stunned. We stared at our situation maps on which medicine thick red lines of encirclement and arrows show the enemy attacks, penetrations and directions of advance. We had never imagined a catastrophe of such proportions to be possible,

Speaker 3:          00:16:03       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:03       The mighty wedges of the Russian armored columns could not be stopped. And a myriad of highly mobile cavalry troops' increase the muddle and confusion in the rear of the bloody rent front of the army.

Speaker 3:          00:16:18       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:16:19       so you know, obviously I skipped a little bit moving into this port point, but at this point they're completely surrounded, like I said, cut off and the Russians are applying the pressure. The enemy appeared to be systematically are evading our blows and to be withdrawing into the depths of Russia. So this is going, he's kind of reflecting back on how they ended up there and he says that he says the enemy appeared to be systematically evading our blows and to be withdrawing into the depth of Russia. This is what the Russians do. It's what they did in Napoleon.

Speaker 3:          00:16:53       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:16:54       in 1812 and they're doing it again here and he back to the book, taken as a whole, this was a masterpiece of general staff thinking today I'm convinced that those withdrawals of what Russian forces during the summer of 1942 or an outstanding and Nachman of traditional war Russian war tactics. So Hitler got Lord in and they didn't pay attention. They didn't reflect on history. And as we all, while I was, most people know this was also Hitler opening another front and trying to fight on multiple fronts at the same time, which, which goes against a certain law of combat called prioritize and execute. Focus your, your forces on your most important thing and then move on. Hitler gets an F on prioritize and execute

Speaker 1:          00:17:47       back to the book it had now come to pass. We were actually caught in a trap. How were we to get out series as the situation in the pocket and he refers to this area as the pocket. This is the pocket of Russian soldiers. Serious has the situation in the pocket was from the very outset in our bunker. That was still an atmosphere of confidence and a certain feeling of superiority, so that's by the way, that's how you end up in these situations and the Germans absolutely believed their own propaganda, that they were the best soldiers in that they were the master race and that the these Bolsheviks couldn't fight them. When you believe that, you think you can march right into Stalin, grab and take it and the wind is not going to bother you immediately. An eerie memory arose within me and intensified my amp apprehensive unrest with each passing day. It was the memory of several fanatical statements that Hitler had recently made in public speeches. The German soldier. He said, now stood on the vulva and no power on earth could make him leave the supreme warlord. That's a reference to Hitler and he's got an in quotes. The supreme warlord had emphatically committed himself. He had prophecized and demanded that styling rod be relentlessly attacked and taken in presumptuous terms. He'd even sworn before God and history, never again to relinquish on this conquest presenting it as already achieved

Speaker 1:          00:19:24       with such an attitude as this on the part of the supreme warlord was giving up the vulgar and retreating conceivable at all. So Hitler had painted himself into a corner with a paintbrush of arrogance and it ended up in this situation where he's saying, nope, we're never going to leave,

Speaker 1:          00:19:45       and he does not. Back to the book, the fate of more than a quarter million human beings with decided over such a distance so that the fewer headquarters is 2000 mile, 2000 kilometers. It's like 1500 miles distant away and they're making decisions. This is called micromanagement, by the way. This is called micro management. This is not decentralized command. This is the fourth law of combat. From the book called extreme ownership. Hitler gets an F on decentralized command. He's micromanaging his troops that are 1500 miles away. The fate of more than a quarter million human beings was decided over such a distance from their Hitler repeatedly addressed orders and appeals directly to stolen, wrote to the Stalin Ground Army, which had been removed from under the command of Army Group B and reassigned to the newly form army group. Don Don. Don is a river now. Everybody knew that they needed to perform a military maneuver referred to as a breakout, which means you picture your inner circle, you're surrounded by troops.

Speaker 1:          00:20:51       You pick one part of that circle of, of the people that are surrounding you and you attack and you break through it. It sounds like what it is, it's a breakout. Everybody knew that they needed to break out. They're like, hey, we're surrounded. We need fuel. We need water, we need food. We don't have any of that. We need to break out, and so everyone was kind of prepared to do that. Back to the book. Our army still deposed of about 130 combat ready tanks and about the same number of armored scout cars and other armored vehicles and other words. We still had a powerful motorized units available everywhere. People were waiting for the relieving signal for the breakout with fluttering hearts. We followed the preparations that were taking place mainly in the western sector of the army. In anticipation of the expected operation. The order had be given to destroy all superfluous materiel everywhere, damaged guns, tanks and trucks use this communication and engineering equipment, huge amounts of clothing, files and paper, even food where being consigned to flames, so they all think that they're going to break out there.

Speaker 1:          00:21:55       Assuming, look, we're going to break out this the only solution right now. We're surrounded. We need to attack one area and get out of here. So they start going, okay, before we leave, I'm going to burn as fuel. We're going to burn this food. We're not going to leave anything for the Russians. Back to the book. According to the decision by army command, the retreat from Stalin Grad was to begin on 26 November. We did not entertain the slightest doubt that the supreme command must be convinced of its necessity. We counted firmly on it's being carried out. I will never forget how stunned we all were. The agitation. Yes, the petrifying, a horror that befell us, especially among the higher ranks of our staff, went on 24 November. The message came in from army that Hitler had forbidden the plan breakout and finally ordered the Stalin Grad army to temporarily take up a position of all around defense. So Hitler says, no, you're not leaving. Oh, you're surrounded by the way, they're surrounded by a force of about a million Russian soldiers, but, but, but it's more than that because they're surrounded by the country of Russia.

Speaker 1:          00:23:09       Back to the book, that fatal radio message from the distant fure headquarters had come like a stroke of lightning, forbidding the plan, withdrawal of our northern front, that attachment of our forces from Stalin Grad, and thereby the hope for the breakout. This decision by the supreme command was just as heavy a blow for the staff at the army as it was for us. We are unable to satisfy ourselves as to why all the reports, admonitions and requests for our responsible of our responsible higher staffs who were best able to judge the events and all the dangers they entailed had not been successful. So this is something that patents said the commander on the ground is always right. Meaning if you're sitting in an ivory tower somewhere, there's a guy on the ground, he's right and you're wrong. He's on the ground. He knows what's happening. Now, could we come up with some exceptions to this? Absolutely. You have better intelligence of what's happening. You may know some, you may be have overhead coverage or you get, you get air reports or you have the, in these days you have satellites looking at things. So yeah, there's situations where you might know a little bit more, but the default thought process should be the guy on the ground is, is has a better situational awareness than I do. I'm going to go with their call and here's Hitler saying no.

Speaker 1:          00:24:29       Now, general policy, who is the commander of all the, all the German soldiers general, Paul's back to the book General Paulus addressed himself directly to Hitler with a very serious and responsible evaluation of the situation in this momentous radio message. He had adamantly stressed that the fact that all his senior commanding generals shared the conviction that because it would be impossible to adequately supplied the army in time, it would shortly be destroyed unless a concentration of all available forces were to succeed in divine decisively beating the enemy, attacking from the west and the south. So it's not just one general at Saint Louis every but every user, there's, there's 250 to 300,000 Germans there. There's a lot of senior military people. All of them are saying, we need to leave. Hitler Says No. Why? Because Hitler's just that like, no, you got, you guys don't leave because we're were Germans. We flight till the Dan. It's arrogance or, I mean it's, it's absolutely partially arrogance that he thinks no, we'll hold out. It will still just when two were us. Yeah. We'll just, we'll just hold it out and I think he's being stubborn and,

Speaker 3:          00:25:42       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:42       Yeah. He has the kind of word like he, he made a call kind of thing. He made a call and then they're like, hey, we this, the call is no good. We're going to do this. He's like, no, I made the call. Yeah, exactly. What's going on? Ego. I mean obviously Hitler has probably one of the biggest egos of any human being ever can hear you see it. Yeah, sure. In full effect.

Speaker 3:          00:26:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:03       Even though he had left, no doubt, but in his view, the decision promising salvation lane, an immediate breakout in the end, he to this talking about policy in the end he to submitted and obeyed for him in order was an order in spite of everything. All that remained to us was to hope for a rescue operation from the outside. I will say this actually, and there's some books that the parts of this book that I'm not going to cover because we just don't have time. Well, there's that guy that gave that speech goring the beginning. He had also told Hitler, Hey, no worries. We can resupply. He was the before taking over all the German military forces. He was in charge of the German air force, the Luftwaffe. Uh, and he said, look, we can resupply these guys. Don't worry about it. Don't worry. And I think he probably said that at a time when it didn't look like they're going to get completely surrounded, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:26:59       Oh yeah, we'll, we supply him, don't worry about them. And we'll get into some of the numbers on what they said they could do. But that's another reason why Hitler, Hitler thought, Oh, we can resupply. But he also had people on the ground. He's surrounded by, yes men. Gotcha. So no one wants to disagree with the boss, man. In this case, Adolf Hitler by saying, so when he says, look, can't we resupply them? Yes, yes, we can respond from the air. And also he was saying, hey, can't someone, instead of them breaking out and going toward back towards Germany, why don't we have some German troops go towards them and break into them? That way we can open up some supply lines. So when did he get told when he, when he offered that solution, he got told, yes, we can do it. Yes, we can do it. So he's surrounded by yes men. And you know how he ended up surrounded by yes men. His Ego. I don't want, I don't like to be told, oh, you're going to tell me no, you're fired. Get someone in here that's going to tell me that they can do what I'm saying. And then that person's going to get promoted. And then you get surrounded by people that want to get promoted.

Speaker 1:          00:27:57       Chuck proceeding on and there was one general that really made it, made a significant effort. Here we go back to the book initially, General Vaughan side. Litz was dumbfounded, stunned. He accepted the order, but in his heart he rejected it. Particularly since he was painfully aware that his own war hands were tied. Not until the following day, 25, November, 1942 did general von side, let's react to Hitler's orders. And his reaction was as much filled with a sense of responsibility as it was temperamental, addressed to the army command. It took the form of a detailed evaluation of the situation that core commander had had his chief of staff prepare. It's surmised, once again, all the arguments against the solid ground army digging in and urged the breaking out of the ring immediately. So what's cool about this book, they actually have this actual document that this guy wrote.

Speaker 1:          00:29:03       Have you ever heard me talk on the podcast about getting all your ducks in a row and like, Hey, if my boss tells me now, cool, I'm going to, I'm going to get all the information, I'm going to come back. And how many agree if I'm going to make a, uh, a bullet proof argument and my boss is going to agree with, because you can't, my argument's gonna be bulletproof because I'm right. And if I wasn't right, then I wouldn't, I wouldn't go this far, right? I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna put my, my reputation on the line arguing something that I don't truly believe is right. You know, all through I'll say, okay, well you know what, he could be right, so you know what, I'm going to try and execute it to my best of my ability. In this case. Sidelights is like, no, it's not.

Speaker 1:          00:29:39       No. And, and he says, okay, I'm going to perform. I'm gonna put together this thing. They have the document inside this book. I would read it, but it's long. It's, it's so detailed that it would take too much time, but it lays out every little detail of why they need to break out and not in an emotion. That's what's beautiful about it. Not In an emotional way. Well, maybe I just need to check myself because maybe more emotion was needed. But generally if you come across as really emotional, Hitler would think, oh, well a boss would think, oh, you're just emotional about this echo. You're just emotional buddy. You just need to calm down, carry out the orders. So he didn't he, he played the role or he, he used the strategy of just calm, this is what's going on. This is what needs to change or this is what we need to do and if we don't, it's going to be catastrophic.

Speaker 1:          00:30:24       Back to the book in the emergency situation, intensified by the o k h and o cages over commandos date eight or switches, the supreme high command of the German Army General Vaughn side lifts demanded from the commander in chief of the army that he act immediately against orders, in other words, against Hitler. So, so sidelights when silence got told no, he's like, no, listen, we need to do it anyways. That's how passionate. So now he's starting to get a little bit emotional and passionate. He declared it to be an imperative duty to the army and the German people to obey the dictates of conscious and to seize the freedom of action that had been forbidden in order to prevent threatening catastrophe. The memo was passed on by army command, but had no effect whatsoever. And so they had to suffer the additional pain that in the final analysis they could, but give in and fulfill the bidder soldierly duty to obey against their own better insight. Now I will tell you that as Napoleon said, if you execute a plan that you know is wrong, you are culpable for executing it and these guys, they would not stand up against it. Like

Speaker 1:          00:31:39       back to the book, we were all deeply disturbed and full of despair and in our hearts even outraged what was being demanded of us normally contradicted. All military experience at win against every soldierly feeling and robbed of has any hope of any hope of being able to save ourselves by breaking out under her own power.

Speaker 2:          00:32:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:00       In the last week of November when the formations that had been heavily damaged during the initial retreat where hastily and with great difficulty establishing themselves on a new main line of Resistance Army issued a grave order of the day. I can still remember the exact wording it started. Six army has been surrounded. This is not your fault as always, you have fought bravely and tenaciously up to the moment. The enemy had you by the neck.

Speaker 1:          00:32:30       It went on to point out that the hard fighting, suffering and deprivations that would still be demanded of the troops and which they would have to endure for a time in hunger and frost. Trusting in the help from outside that had been so definitely promised. So Hitler did say, Hey, I'm going to send help from the outside. Don't worry about it. You stay put. Finally mentioned was made of the relief operation to which Hitler had personally committed himself psychologically clever and calculating the appeal ended with the encouraging words, promising consolation and salvation. Hold on the fure, we'll get you out this final sentence. Appealing so strongly to emotion, which injected a new tone into the previously factual and sober language of military orders gave rise to discussions among our staff. It made me realize on top of all that had already happened, how great the sacrifice was going to be that would be demanded of the troops.

Speaker 1:          00:33:31       By the way, these guys traveled there and had a really hard time of it. They know how hard it was for them to get there, and now they're being told that the people that are going to, the way that they're going to get saved is by someone else coming behind them to help them going through the same hardships that they barely got there. So they're there. Their outlook isn't good on the situation he had. They're doubtful. Back to the book, a large number of the soldiers who had been in constant exhaustion is incontinent and exhausting action in the front line for two years without leave, without having been home to see their loved ones. So a lot of these guys, so they had actually survived a winter early on. They had survived a winter as they pushed into German or as they put it into push in Russia and now they're waiting for another one.

Speaker 1:          00:34:25       But these soldiers had been fighting for two straight years. Hard fighting back to the book. Naturally the troops, we're not in a position to appreciate the full extent of the suffering and deprivation as they were about to face. They knew nothing of the difficult problems of the overall supply situation. So again, this guy is working at the headquarters, meaning he's, you know, with the commanders and the leadership, so he's tracking all the logistics of the situation. The frontline soldier doesn't know. The front line soldier expects that they're going to bring me bullets, they're gonna bring me food. He realizes because he sees what's actually happening and that that's going to be a real problem. They had no inkling of the countless worries that lay so heavily and depressingly on the higher staffs, nor at first were they aware that that at one stroke the encirclement had made it impossible to complete preparations for winter positions out there and the supply depots of the army, late tens of thousands of fur coats, warm stockings, protective headgear, and other items of winter clothing, which could now no longer reach the encircled forces. For the most part, the men remained completely inadequately supplied with winter gear and exposed to the murderous frost is that thousands and thousands of warm weather gear or I should say cold weather gear and now they're going to get nothing. They're caught off back the book. We calculated that our own army, whose total strength before the INCIRCL men had been about 330,000 men now numbered about 280,000 so they're already short at 50,000 and killed

Speaker 1:          00:36:03       we the staff, the officers in the staff departments also pinned our hopes on the relief operation, which was being prepared. No one even considered that Hitler would be ready to abandon the outstandingly proven six army on the Vulcan, throw it to the wolves. So these guys are even, I said that even though I said they weren't hopeful, they're also thinking there's no way that Hitler is going to leave 300,000 soldiers out here. There's no way. Yeah. Back to the book, he was bound to find ways and means to rectify the devil situation. There were even starry eyed dreamers, not, however, among the older and more experienced who maintained that the fewer would not only get us out, but it probably already conceived a plan to turn our apparent defeat into a glorious triumph. By and circling all the enemies armies that are surrounding us. None of these dreamers and believers in miracles who kept this, who kept surfacing here and there until the very end, had a clear idea of what was implied by the fact that German soldiers will simultaneously fighting on the North Cape and the Bay of Biscay and the front of Leningrad and veers on in the caucus in Crete and in north Africa.

Speaker 3:          00:37:11       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:37:12       so again, this guy's fighting fronts all over the place and the and the staff officers, the leadership knew how thinly spread the German army was. The frontline troops in, you know, they didn't make sense of that. During the weeks of December, the fighting strength of the army was deteriorating at a horrendous pace. The blame for this lay mainly in the, in the inadequate air lift here, a catastrophic picture was slowly emerging in order to be able to maintain its ability to live and fight. Our army had initially requested 750 tons of supplies per day,

Speaker 3:          00:37:53       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:53       Later reducing this to 500 tons per day. The J you 52 cargo aircraft had about a two ton load. The want the h g one one one fighter bomber had held about 1.5 tons. So this is going to require like 2000 aircraft to be able to make this happen. What do they end up with? Back to the book, they only brought in 80 to 120 tons of the required supplies. In other words, not more than one fifth of the amount needed purely and simply this meant a daily deficit of 10,000 kilograms bread and a fatal under supply of desperately needed fuel and ammunition. So we're getting one fifth of what they need. Now we have to be careful cause that's a little statistic that were thrown out there, right? Like oh we're getting one fifth of what we need, but I'll think of a human being. And what you need is a human being just food. And you cut that down to one fifth of what you need. You know you need 2,500 calories a day, you're going to get 500 [inaudible]. That's what we're talking about. Yeah, you need, and by the way, you're fighting and you're going to, you're being attacked. So you need thousand bullets a day.

Speaker 2:          00:39:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:14       Right. You need a thousand bullets a day. You're getting 120 bullets. It's there. Things are not looking good. Back to the book, the sunset, soon after lunch, and by 1400 and 1500 hours, it was already dark. So this is, now we're talking Russian winter by two or three o'clock in the afternoon, it's dark.

Speaker 2:          00:39:38       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:39:40       And every day this to reminded us, depressingly here in the desolation of the snow Brep snow bounce step of the enormous distance that separated us from home were we not all the living and the dead long buried in a gigantic mass grave. Thoughts like this occasionally befell me when I returned from various sectors of the front, where in my role as liaison officer, I had been sent on specific assignments to gather urgently needed information.

Speaker 2:          00:40:12       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:40:12       They're on the heights above the, the infamous row shock a valley. The men of our divisions lay in desperate battle, demanding bloody sacrifice there in the trenches, in foxholes, in the snow. The soldiers were dying of exhaustion and cold because they're steadily shrinking. Rations of bread and other food issued. Food issued. We're no longer sufficient to provide the physical stamina needed to combat frost at sickness, so they're starving to death. They're starving to death in the freezing death and they're, they're being attacked and killed by the Russians with no with no Emma. One day in the second week of December, the staff's first heard the news that the army group, dawn under field, Marshall Van Main Stein von Main Stein had begun the long hope relief for the long hope for relief operation. Soon the good news, it also reached the troops. The words gave new impetus everywhere in particularly on the hard pressed western perimeter of the pocket spread like lightning mainstream man Stein is coming. The already dying hopes burst forth the new new courage, happy expectations. A new spirit of initiative began to blossom. The sufferings and sacrifices to date had not been in vain. After all, salvation was now beckoning what the fewer had promised he was bound to deliver, so they get word Ben Stein's coming. This is this, this is good. If everything went well, they fought, the hour of all relief could just coincide with Christmas.

Speaker 1:          00:41:54       The motorized groups and strong tank units being led by Colonel General Hoff elements of which had been brought in from France in great haste had begun their relief, offensive Hoff spearhead tanks were only 50 kilometers away. Hold on. We're coming. Said one of the encouraging radio messages would spread like wildfire amongst the western edge of the pocket. So they're in radio communication 50 kilometers and this well respected leader Hoff. He's on the way and he tells him, hold on, we're coming. Do you ever, isn't that like a jinx right there? You know what I mean? Like, do you ever celebrate something even even inside your head, you celebrate something a little bit before? You should don't ever do that. Am I superstitious? Because I believe that way.

Speaker 4:          00:42:45       If you think that that's how it truly works. But I think, um, I th I think it's superstitious, but I also think there's some psychology behind that. Yeah, I think so too. Yeah. Yeah. Especially if you realize, if you just realize, oh, I just celebrated early right there. So it's, it makes you uneasy or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:43:03       I feel like that guy, that guy got a certain level of satisfaction just by saying like, don't worry, we're coming. Like he had this moment of glory. That's glorious. It's a glorious thing to be able to say, don't worry, we're coming. It's a glorious thing to be able to say, and he took that. He took the easy money right there

Speaker 4:          00:43:24       psychologically, instead of being like, hey, we're not there yet. We need to be ready to worry about where we are. Yeah, yeah. The yeah. Finish strong kind of thing. It's like the guy who's running the touchdown, right? He celebrates the 30 yard line, right? The 25 he puts the hand up. Who was that? There's like a classic creeps up behind them. You know what? This guy wasn't even Leon Lett. He played for the, I want to say Dallas cowboys. He was like a,

Speaker 1:          00:43:52       like a deep, deep, I want to say nineties maybe. How many other Dallas cowboy players can you remember the name of from the nineties do you remember? A lot of them.

Speaker 4:          00:44:03       Like a handful. Just let the coroner, Leon, he's infamous for this. I mean, poor guy, you know, he, he's a defensive line man or something. Recovers a fumble, runs it in for the touchdown and he's, he's doing, he's not even doing and putting it in the above his head. He's putting it on the site, kind of like celebrating it's, and I think they stripped him and recovered it I think if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, it was bad. Psychologically you can't stop. You gotta Kinda strong zee money you to finish the sprint to the

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       finish line or that like races, like a hundred meter dash, you know the guys like, or the 200 meter and he's like, yeah, I want it. Then the guy, I'm real hungry guy gets it, you know, right at the end. So that's Hoff. Hoff takes the easy money tank can be doing it off. Back to the book in the sure knowledge that before us was the last chance for our salvation. We feverously awaited the decisive hour with a feeling of confidence. The orders we expected could not be delayed much longer, but all too soon. Our hopes were to be bitterly disappointed. Alarming messages began to came in rapidly attacking Russian tank forces were embroiling, the relieving army and heavy fighting. We're slowing the advance and finally leading in connection with the Russian offensive group operations west of the dawn to a serious crisis for the entire army group. One of the attacks hit Colonel General Hoff who is hastening towards us in fearful tension and delay mounting an agitation. We read the messages we were receiving from the far distant German air reconnaissance and radio surveillance you units soon. These brought news of disaster. The relief operation had began to run down Hoff's forces in turn threatened with being surrounded. We're finally forced to retreat.

Speaker 1:          00:45:51       The front fell back hundreds of kilometers and the encircled Stalin Grad or me on the Volga was left to its fate.

Speaker 2:          00:46:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:46:01       Only much later was I to learn of tragic details of the events and circumstances that had sealed the fate of the encircled army. At this point, I did not know then that Hitler was still in no way prepared to give up stolen ground on the vulgar that for the second time and after the dramatic conflicts and the conflicts that he's talking about, his between him, between Hitler and the people that his advisors, he had explicitly forbidden the breakout of the six army against the will of his chief of staff and an opposition to the demands of the army group dawn.

Speaker 2:          00:46:37       So

Speaker 1:          00:46:39       hit little leaves them, abandons them back to the book. Among the circle of our closer comrades, we no longer entertained any illusions about the bleakness of our situation. The German front had withdrawn a great distance away and for the time being there would be no new thought or Knuth. No thought of a new relief operation. Would the German front be able to hold out for several more weeks? It was hardly to be expected. Hunger, frost and sickness. We're cutting terribly. Intuit's waning strength and deaf was reaping and an uncanny harvest and not only on the fire spewing iron ring around the pocket.

Speaker 2:          00:47:23       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:24       And even the conditions for a great saving breakout operations scarcely existed any longer. In such an event, the army would only be able to remain mobile for a few kilometers because the lack of fuel.

Speaker 2:          00:47:36       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:47:37       and if Stalin Grad will work to be given up, what then would happen to the growing army of wounded, sick and exhausted men? Did the o k h intend to give up the vulgar at all? The measures ordered so far seem to point the opposite way. Once again, I was often forced to recall Hitler's fanatical wor words about the German soldier on the vulgar about Stalin Rod, and each time an icy uneasy crept through my bones, maybe yes, maybe we were supposed to hold on to the bitter end to stay put and fight to the last bullet.

Speaker 2:          00:48:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:17       On the dark horizon, the outlines of a terrible disaster began to emerge. Christmas eve approached all the visible and the invisible wounds, which the cruel events had caused, burned even more painfully on this night. The atmosphere was depressed. Memories of former Christmas celebrations with their blissful Shimmer, only dimly illuminated are harsh reality. As from a world bone gone.

Speaker 2:          00:48:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:49       The well loved Christmas carols sounded in low melancholy this.

Speaker 1:          00:48:58       So hope is pretty much vanquished at this point. Not Completely, cause he's still in May. He's still saying maybe, maybe they're just going to leave us here and fight to the last man, which is a crazy thought because I'm going to say this number again, 250 to 300,000 soldiers. This isn't like, Hey, you've got 18 guys fight to last man. It's the Alamo, right? Yeah. This isn't that. This is because that, that might have, you know that that's not going to have a strategic impact on the situation. You lose 300,000 combat veterans, which, which, you know, the hard combat hardened veterans, this is going to have a strategic implication. Mm. I mean of course every soldier that dies is, is a epic of event in that soldier's life, obviously in their family and everything else. But when you start talking about leaving 300,000 people to die for nothing, it's, it's, he still can't quite get that. He's still not quite there. He sees it on the horizon. He's not quite there though. Back to the book. The New Year had arrived.

Speaker 2:          00:50:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:13       Jangling frost layover stolen grot over the stall and drug pocket and breathe. It's icy, deadly breath. The sharp wind blew through the joints of doors and windows and in the bunkers and from the floors, the cold crept up to one's knees. The daily casualty reports from our divisions that increasingly reported losses other than by enemy action represented a shattering balance on the death sheet.

Speaker 1:          00:50:39       So what he's saying there is like, yeah, people are dying from combat, but even more people are dying just from cold and starvation. Yeah. Again, the Russians furiously attacked several sectors of our perimeter. What did we have left to oppose these powerful Russian elite troops who were protected from the frost and had a full stomach? Not to mention there numerous tanks, guns, rocket launchers, and mortars. The only small numbers of heavy weapons with insufficient, strictly rationed ammunition. It's all we had only emaciated men exhausted by hunger among whom? The fighting the cold and spreading diseases. We're taking a daily frightening tall. How much longer could the perimeter withstand the pressure? It did not escape our attention that the Russians appear to be concentrating in front of our sector in preparation for a major blow. The last sob, sad possibility grew even clearer on the dark horizon. The fate of our destruction by a shattering off friends IV breaking over our heads.

Speaker 1:          00:51:46       So again, it's interesting that this guy's, well, two things I should point out. Number one, it's interesting that this guy's perspective because he's in the staff and so he sees more of what's happening from the general officers. But let's also make note that he's not on the front lines and he's so he has it relatively good, meaning these protected by the, by the rush from the Russians, by some distance. I mean he's still getting mortared, etc. So getting artillery, but he's not, he's not eye to eye with the Russians like the guys like the soldiers on the front lines that are sitting in a little slit trench in the ground and the Tundra. Hmm. One of the things that he sees is a, is a meeting here we go back to the book. An important meeting of the general staff took place. At our core, which the commander in chief of the army general policy attended with his chief of staff, the serious reserved expression of the tall figure with the head of a scientist reflected something of a burden of responsibility that press down tormenting Lee on the shoulders of this man who was the last time I was to see how our army commander in the pocket.

Speaker 1:          00:52:48       As far as I can remember, he never visited our core again. I soon learned of the outcome of the meeting and the grave words of our general staff officers left no doubt about the consequences of the orders that have been issued in the meantime.

Speaker 2:          00:53:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:04       They dealt with the Mo mobilization of the last reserves of the six the army, the encircled forces were to hold on and fight to the last,

Speaker 2:          00:53:13       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:53:14       For this purpose, the formation of fortress battalions was to be prepared and executed as quickly as possible. All remaining reserves of able bodied men were to be collected in uses. Infantry members of the WAFA ground personnel and anti aircraft troops gunners who no longer had guns. Pans are granted years engineers, truck drivers, clerical staffs, rear echelon and supply personnel or once again to be ruthlessly combed out, the order of mounted to the virtual disillusion of the rear echelon services and clearly demonstrated that the immobilized army was doomed to stay put and fight to the last man and the last bullet. So there you go. Everyone's going to fight cooks, supply people. You're all going to become an infantry men now and this clearly indicates to a weeder that that means they're not going anywhere and they're going to stay there. They're going to fight to the last man back to the book, we felt that we had already been written off by the higher ups and all that remained for us was to perform a heroic, if futile gesture to ensure the fulfillment of a the historic mission. And he's got quotes around that of the army of Stalin Grad on the vulgar. The troops were again given the cheering radio message, which the fewer and supreme warlord had sent at the turn of the year. Six army has my promise that everything is being done to get it out.

Speaker 1:          00:54:39       But we now viewed this not just with doubt, but as downright deception. They don't believe Hitler anymore. They used to just doubt him. Now. Now they think he's deceiving them. And again, this is not, this is no small group people. Yeah. Back to the book, the bread ration was reduced to 50 grams per day, ringing cold, knowing Hong are creeping illness, enemy fire combined in an indissoluble offensive packed dysentery. Typhoid fever had appeared as uncanny guests and the plague of lice increased from day to day.

Speaker 1:          00:55:21       Death danced as murderers, Rondo back and forth throughout the pocket. His headquarters where the numerous places of suffering despair, the dressing stations in field hospitals that filled to overflowing alarmingly. But he also felt at home on the lines day and night. So death is everywhere. Isn't it weird? You know, you think like just being sick. You were telling me you were sick a couple of days ago. Common cool. Yeah. And you think about what being sick does to you and now this is your being sick and it doesn't matter. Like there's no mercy, you're, you're, there's no mercy. Back to the back during back the book during 50 days, that pocket battled lasted so far. He, when he's talking about death, he had already cleaned out horribly among the men of the army. About one third of its manpower was gone. Of the more than 300,000 men who were present at the time of the Russian breakthrough, about 200,000 we're probably still alive. And how many of these enduring and hoping, fighting and suffering human beings had deaf, not already marked on his own news that we could no longer count on any relief. Before spring was really shattering. There was nothing more to be done. Save to hang on and it door the horror.

Speaker 1:          00:56:47       Now we get a little opportunity here. Here we go. There was a surrender proposal sent to our encircled army by the Soviet supreme command. The document was addressed to Paula who had been promoted to colonel general and to all the officers and men of the German forces fighting. It's stolen rod. It was signed by Colonel General of the artillery worn Varone off.

Speaker 2:          00:57:13       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:57:14       And by the commander in chief of the forces of the Dawn Front Lieutenant General Rokos Wicki, who had now obviously been put in sole charge of all the forces surrounding us. The proposal began with a short factual and large the correct evaluation of our situation. In particular, it's stress, the catastrophic state of supply of our troops who are suffering from hunger, cold and sickness, lack of winter clothing, and terribly in sanitary conditions. Realistic possibilities of breaking the encircling ring no longer existed. Any further resistance in such a hopeless situation had to be senseless. Therefore, in order to avoid further unnecessary shedding of blood, the Red Army was proposing a number of terms. The document ended with a reference director to the commander in chief of Stalin Grad Army, pointing out that in the event of refusal, the forces of the Red Army and air force would be obliged to destroy the pocket for which he, Colonel General Paulus would bear the responsibility. You still got 200,000 people and you get an offer, you get 24 hours to respond. You basically surrender everybody. Yeah, everybody's going to surrender. Yeah. And and they weren't sure how they were going to get treated. I mean they were fairly confident, wasn't be treated good. Uh, hold on the whole though man. It's all the dysentery treated very good either that's not treating you very good at all. Back to the book, we soon received various orders, directives and messages. Who's burden was that? The surrender was out of the question.

Speaker 1:          00:59:05       The commander in chief had passed the Russian ultimatum onto the fewer headquarters and ask for freedom of action for all eventualities. It immediate reply hit the red personally forbidden surrender and Paula said rejected in writing the proposal, the Soviet,

Speaker 1:          00:59:23       the troops were not informed not to be informed in detail, but from now on they were ordered to fire without warning on flags of truth of truce appearing near the front lines. This instruction from army, which we received by radio was especially revealing as to the intentions of leadership in our staff. It was received with rejection at objection because it was a clear breach of international law so they don't get told like, Hey, we're not spreading. What they get told is if you see anyone with flags, a truce, shoot them immediately, which is basically saying we're not surrendering the back to the book. I was reminded again of Hitler's high sounding words about the invincibility of the German soldier for whom nothing must be seen to be impossible. The very thought of capitulation must be an irreconcilable, must be irreconcilable with the prestige of the supreme warlord.

Speaker 1:          01:00:14       He puts that in quotes every time I, I don't call it out every time, but he does. He's sorta mocking Hitler with that. In his speech in Munich, shortly before our encirclement, he had had he not solidly sworn. You may rest assured, I repeat this with full responsibility before God in history that we shall never again leave Stalin Grad. Never again for life or death. We were committed to the cheerless. Dawn's step here, our fate must come full turn the most terrible weeks. We're still before us and during those ICDs in January, the fearful premonition of what was to come descended upon us like a lead weight on the morning of 10 January, 1943 exactly 24 hours after the ultimatum had expired, the Russian began the destruction of the pocket with a hellish artillery barrage. It was the answer to the rejection of the surrender proposal up upfront among the staff's on the line. I again entered the atmosphere of tension, excitement, nervousness, and despair. The situation was partially unclear and it confused the cat. The catastrophe did indeed appear to be unavoidable.

Speaker 2:          01:01:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:31       Into this helpless situation. Orders from army came in time and time again, defend, hold, clear up the situation. Fight to the last bullet,

Speaker 2:          01:01:41       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:42       From their desks, 2000 kilometers away and he puts in parentheses and exclamation point, the o k h together with the constantly interfering fear, her fear or headquarters forbade any independent withdrawal from endangered from endangered sectors of the perimeter and army, which had to meticulously justify itself for any change in the front line caused by the pressure of circumstances. Obeyed so does classic. It's micromanagement, not decentralized command. They're even saying, look, if your, if your, if your is going to collapse, don't fall back, just die. Which is ridiculous because it doesn't help the situation because now there's a hole and now more, more enemy. You're going to come through the hole and we're going to have people behind us. Yeah. It's like full on kind of what you were talking about last week. Maybe it would be for last week. It's like do it because I said so kind of thing. Yeah like there's no really he is going to die if there's no reason to do it. No strategic reason. They'll tactical reason. Obviously it's do it cause I said so. Yeah. Whatever. Yeah. The army core divisions and regimens obeyed often with bitter criticism, criticism with open or hidden reservations flaring up or knuckling under, but they obeyed and the suffering and dying of troops in the trenches and fox holes in the IC step obeyed, giving their all in the natural fulfillment of their duty or an apathy and silent despair.

Speaker 2:          01:03:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:18       The higher leadership did not stint with recognition, promotions, decorations and metals rain down on mass on the fighting, suffering doomed men. But what purpose did this huge, monstrous commitment and dedication of human being serve in the face of the increasingly help military helplessness and the daily worsening human plight? I was becoming more and more depressed by the torturing question of the why of this sacrifice of most precious blood. This Pinellas dining was it not only for the sake of, of a prestige that a military supreme command thousands of kilometers removed, mercilessly wished to maintain then for whom the price in many thousands of human lives did not appear to be too high.

Speaker 2:          01:04:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:12       This question haunted me and would not leave me until the final sorrowful ending.

Speaker 1:          01:04:21       So he's asking why they start to collapse from the perimeter of the pocket in towards the city of Stalin Grad you. Cause they were kind of pushed out around it, surrounding it and now they're starting to fall back to it where they at least have some coverage back to the book. The withdrawal of the troops finally turned into a full fledged flight into which further formations and combat groups of various divisions were drawn. Whole units cease to exist in this confusion in the sector of our neighbor to our left. This fate also put an end to a whole division that had long been under our command and in the end had burned out like a slag heap.

Speaker 1:          01:05:09       I saw it's distraught general now a commander without troops wandering around in a bunker, desperately seeking a new assignment, so he just lost 20,000 men. He's walking around and saying, what am I supposed to do now? Back to the book and this desperate withdraw was being carried out in icy cold weather and piddle a snow storms at 30 degrees centigrade below zero. That's negative 22 at 30 degrees below zero. The remnant of the regiments that had shrunk to combat groups and the suffering hordes of their shadow of other shattered units moved over the empty white step. Staggering crowds, dragging, dragging crowds of lost ha, lightly wounded and frostbitten soldiers with them. How many of those that's so far had been spared? Enemy fire succumbed there to exhaustion and overexertion to the strains of hunger and to the cold. Innumerable men fell by the wayside and we're soon mercifully cupboard over by the snow and this was no longer an authorized withdrawal.

Speaker 1:          01:06:28       The recoil of the front was now taking place despite standing orders to hold and maintain position at all costs and despite the line of resistance laid down by the okay. So they finally did break and they finally said, you know what? Survival. This is about survival and we're not staying here anymore. We're going to try and get back, fall back. The cycle, the psychological ability of the troops to resist it now also been eroded. There could no longer be any doubt about our fate after the enemy had begun, has decisive attack, bent on destruction and our disillusion was in full pro progress. It was too late for alas. Departure attempt to break out to the west, help from outside could no longer be considered more devastating even than the enemy's weapons were hunger, exhaustion, cold, an illness of all kinds among the soldiers who had not been adequately fed for so many long weeks.

Speaker 1:          01:07:30       With the advent of the incredible indescribable strains of daily retreats. The situation had deteriorated. Catastrophic Lee, we were lacking in food weapons, rest, warmth, hope. In short, we were lacking in all the vital conditions for fighting. Since the long rejection of the surrender proposal, the troops had again survived a long, terrible week of tenacious defensive fighting, retreat and flight, thereby tying down superior and our enemy forces in their area. Now, after the loss of our life support base Patomic Nick airfield on January 16th the time really seemed to have come to stop fighting. The airlift temporarily ceased together.

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       No more food and ammunition and game in the wounded and sick could no longer be flown out. And so that's where they're getting their supplies into Pitt, Tom, nick air field. And that's actually where this guy was for a large chunk of this battle. It's now gone. So now they even, you know, before they were, they were only getting one fifth of what they needed. Well now they're getting zero two by now. Every day that the fighting was prolonged was costing thousands of human lives. There was no more time to be lost and we waited for something to happen like me, a numerable, comrades and brothers and fate probably clung to this same secret hope, but nothing happened.

Speaker 2:          01:08:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:57       And tragedy took its course.

Speaker 2:          01:09:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:02       The Russians, by using their storm troops during the initial days of the offensive, it would probably have been very easy for them to make a further effort and liquidate the pocket relatively quickly, but they no longer needed to make such a highly costly attempt time was on their side by bearing down on our tenacious defense with a crushing attack, our enemy had won its penetration into the pocket. Now he was no longer in a hurry and no longer appeared to consider his victim to be very dangerous. The battle that had begun in the meantime was merely a question of finishing off wounded game already marked for death.

Speaker 2:          01:09:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:40       For some time already, the Russians had dictated the course of events.

Speaker 2:          01:09:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:45       The date of our final end depended on there. We'll alone the stations of the cross of an army of 200,000 soldiers, particularly because of the slow, helpless death of such a vast number of human beings made anything seen before with the exception of Verdun Pale by comparison.

Speaker 2:          01:10:09       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:10:09       A part of the entire German nation was sentenced to death here and buy this. It's vital substance was dangerously under attack. The moral effect of these events touched the whole nation.

Speaker 2:          01:10:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:10:24       In the midst of the general destruction of the army, there were thousands of individual tragedies whose localities of horror where the numerous collection points for the sick and wounded.

Speaker 2:          01:10:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:10:38       Whole convoys of mostly open trucks, overloaded with their pittable freight of freezing wounded, groaning, sick and dying, move deeper into the pocket,

Speaker 2:          01:10:50       okay?

Speaker 1:          01:10:50       From the second half of January until the bitter end, the harsh suffering of the fighting soldiers continued by day and night,

Speaker 2:          01:11:00       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:11:01       After eight evil weeks of indescribable torture in deprivations, they were now plunged into a veritable hell of hopelessness and destruction.

Speaker 2:          01:11:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:11:11       Time and again it was fight, resist, hold to the end than disengage. Withdrawal turned back and dig in again for defense. In the snow and stone only hard frozen earth time. And again, there were heavy losses, panic and flight and the never ending useless struggle, struggle against hunger. In cold among the staffs, there was an unending tension perplexity and despair and feverish activity. Leadership was still to be seen from the higher ha commands came, continue orders, directives, questions, admonitions, threats, criticism, opposition and misgivings were not lacking at the lower levels, but for the time being, the mechanisms of command still function. So despite all this, and even though they're having this, this hasty withdraw that's going against orders, there's still art direction coming out. There's still people being disciplined in the midst of the general suffering and dying. We helplessly watch the catastrophe of destruction approaching us mercilessly. Inexorably.

Speaker 2:          01:12:18       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:12:18       The terrible human tragedy that was nearing its climax was finally commented, commented upon by the war news broadcast at home in the pretty and spirited words, quote in Stalin Grad, sixth army is attaching a mortal honor to it's banners by it's heroic and self sacrificing battle against crushing odds.

Speaker 2:          01:12:43       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:12:45       Many of my comrades had mentally written themselves off intentions to commit suicide were voiced with increasing frequency. Others had given their valuables and wedding rings to be to the wounded being flown out.

Speaker 2:          01:12:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:13:00       I myself had been, had so far been at pains to prepare my relatives for the catastrophe by means of sparse hints.

Speaker 2:          01:13:08       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:13:08       Now I felt the need descend home open word of farewell and gratitude.

Speaker 2:          01:13:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:13:15       The letter was hard to write in my ears. Once more rang, rang the last goodbye. My wife had imploringly in besieging, the called down the telephone line to Kiev on a spring evening of last year before the seemingly endless space of Russian planes. It's swallowed me up.

Speaker 2:          01:13:35       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:13:36       Now all would soon be over. When I see all the letter, I was gripped by a specially deep despair. I felt as though I were suddenly looking into an abyss of suffering and hopelessness towards which our whole nation was reeling. As if the events and Stalin Grad, we're a preview of an immeasurable disaster that was to break upon Germany.

Speaker 2:          01:14:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:14:03       The general of this division division had a nervous breakdown. It was no longer fit for command. His hopes of being flown out, the badly wounded and sick had not been for four fulfilled. He now had to share the fate of his soldiers to the bitter end. This general who is short time before was a commander of a division head carried the responsibility for many thousands of men was once more a mere human being trembling for his life. Then did his questions not reveal the same fear that secretly tormented all of us. We made one another realize that the impending military catastrophe was also a political catastrophe. The result of presumptuous beliefs and actions. The had long shaking. The healthy foundations of our intellectual, cultural, and national life had the power that we served as citizens and soldiers bent it's knee before the law that was rooted in the code of ethics or rather had not a new gospel of violence been proclaimed and introduce that in a fatal reversal of all values had ceased to differentiate between right and wrong. So these guys are realizing what's coming around, what's coming around. He's realizing that the path that they went down as a country was wrong.

Speaker 1:          01:15:38       Back to the book by means of destructive battle against the universal educational and cultural powers of classic antiquity, humanism and Christianity and anti intellectual political religion of power had successively extracted the German people from the best of the commonly held European body of human fought and thereby also out of any commitment to the objective concepts of truth, compassion and justice. Is that, is that his conclusion, like during this, these events or, yes, during these events, he's realizing what, what's happening is that they were wrong and they went immediately. The thing that's crazy about Nazi Germany is how fast that transition took place. It's like we're talking 10 years. What the rise of the, not to rise the Nazis or they're their, they're influencing that. Yeah. The rise of the Nazis just straight up 1933 they started now 1943 so we're 10 years and you have a completely different viewpoint of the world. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:16:51       that's great. I mean, they're going against the see what? Like they're going against the traditional values. They're going against, hey, you know, they're going against the Christian values. They're going against the cultural values. They're going against the national values. Yeah. They're going against them. Yeah. It's, I wonder how much of is that, you know, like the soldiers in the, even the people in the, in the Nazi party. I wonder how much of it is like denial, you know, you know where it's at. You know how like you're signed onto like some leader during the, during the time being, yeah. Or you're saying right now how much of this denial, no, no, no, no, no, no. During, during the ride, remember rape and Dan, can you remember that there was one of the nicest guys, one of the guys who made the biggest sacrifice was this was a straight up actual Nazi and he made massive sacrifice and took huge risks to save as many people as he could.

Speaker 1:          01:17:36       By the way, not white people, not Ariens but, but Chinese. So, so there's a guy that, you know, was more related to the traditional Christian intellectual values. Right. And yet the, okay. The people that are in charge of the country is Nazi. So I guess that makes me an oxy. Yeah. And here we go. And so, and these guys war situation, because there are soldiers, so now they're fighting for that evil force. And like you said, there's some denial. You also get caught up and clearly the Germans got caught up in the nationalism. They got caught up with the Hitler was a great orator and a very moving speaker and they got caught up in that and they weren't in a very depressed economy. So those things all kind of came to head. They'd been in their mind screwed over in World War One and you know, defeated and then treated badly.

Speaker 1:          01:18:28       And you know, there's this whole thing about Hitler's mustache, you know, Hitler has got the funny mustache. Sure. And there's some debate on, on how much of this is actually true, but whether it's true or not as a little bit, it doesn't really matter. But because of what it represents. So the deal was that Hitler's mustache, if you wanted to have a mustache during World War One because of wearing a gas mask, you had to cut your mustache like that. Hitler still wars mustache like that. It was like a constant c symbol that he remembered. He remembered because he was in world war one and he was wounded in World War One and through even despite all that insane sacrifice, they didn't win and they didn't like the way they got treated by the treaty of Versailles. And so they have that anx they had the economic angst, they had all those, an angst built up and Hitler came along and was ready to let them focus on something else.

Speaker 1:          01:19:23       And and now what, what weeder is realizing here is like yeah he had us focus on something else. All right. And what he held had us focus on wasn't good. It was evil. This is crude analogy you to training day. I have watched training day. That's kind of the same thing when you watch cause cause the new youth, the trainee, by the way, when I see a movie, I see it like one time in an airplane and I know I'm not, I'm not going to be fully familiar with uh, sort of pairing the rise of Nazi Germany and the deaths of millions of people to the movie training day. And this is total speculation is just what we're talking about as far as like you people that are signed on,

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       Hey I'm German, you know, it's cool and you know, we're all Jeremy, we weren't, you know, solidarity where your and then kind of the Nazi party starts rising, starts giving these sorta sort of certain types of influence and they're like, oh all right, cool. I mean I wasn't really thinking that but all right, we're still, Germans were cool and it starts escalating and slowly it's like okay, you can't turn back it. That's what happening. Training Gay, right? Yeah. Like he signed on, he signed on and he's like Dang. He's like, I don't know about all this but all right. Hey, I'm signed onto the cause and after a while, which is the same point that this guy got and got to where it's like, man, okay, you guys pushed it too much, man, I cannot sign onto this. And then you reflect back on all the violations, you know, like

Speaker 1:          01:20:48       to slip. You start to slip when you don't hold the line yesterday. Nothing. So that's what happens. And that's what makes leadership hard. That's what makes life hard is it's really easy to get tempted to go down these trails, these paths that are not what you should be doing. And you got to kind of amendment, and it's hard because in the beginning, like

Speaker 4:          01:21:15       you know you're, you're going down a path you're already signed on, right? And then you see one teeny tiny violation and I was like, what am I going to do? Like make this big stink about this teeny tiny violation. Yeah, for sure. Then then you keep going and then you had already made that exception. Time goes on. And what are you going to bring that little thing up again?

Speaker 1:          01:21:31       Psychologically? What a Denzel Washington. He's, he's, he doesn't introduce that he's, and go straight to level eight violation. Right. He just gives little little violations.

Speaker 4:          01:21:44       Can you down the path, a little bit of abuse there, but hey, we're fighting back. It's all good. And then like a little like Wah, Wah, Wah, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:21:52       Yeah, exactly. Right. And that's, that's what, that's what Hitler did. Yeah. That's what Hillary started with. Like, Hey, you know, we don't want to have this happening. We've got to keep these things in check. Look, we're going to, at least we're going to, we're going to put the Jews in a neighborhood, right. We'll put them in a separate neighborhood. That way they're not amongst us. Right. Put them over there and didn't know and it's okay. You know what? We're actually not going to be to move moving somewhere else. Put Him in a work camp. Okay. And then you just write, you slowly escalating before you're murdering two, 6 million people

Speaker 4:          01:22:21       and then all of a sudden what you're not signed on all of a sudden you kind of thing and you're like, Dang. In your head, you're like, Dang, I was assigned on to some of the stuff earlier, but I had let it go. I'm trapped. You know,

Speaker 1:          01:22:30       now you're trapped. And that's where he is right now. And He's trapped facing his death, recognizing that, yeah, successively extracted the German people from the best of the commonly held European body of human thought like you saying exactly what you just said. Success successively. It's just a little bit at a time. Back to the book, all of us who wore uniform war entangled in a fabric of developments, in circumstances that we certainly had not sought or desired. Now let's not make any excuses. Let's not make any excuses, but we see how it kinda happened as you just said. Yeah. We surely could not believe that our employment here in Stalin Grad was part of a noble legitimate battle for Germany and interests. Painfully. We felt that the soldierly virtues of bravery, commitment, loyalty, and obedience to duty in the objective sense, we're being despicably misused this deep and the tragedy of cruel events in which we now would have to atone for much that we had never wanted.

Speaker 1:          01:23:44       So yeah, that's um, you know, I've heard that argument sometimes if you, well, you're going to kill, there's a bad regime and you're going to go and you're going to attack the regime. And then some of the people that are just there by chance, you know, you hear that argument. Well, they're allowing that regime to exist. Now that's a tough argument to have because you got somebody for them to rebel could mean death and so they don't get, they don't rebel. And so then, and put in a bad situation. That's a tough one. Yeah, fully. But somebody asked me the other day, so yeah, it's a long those lines, you know, some long winded question on Twitter about what would you do if you are not in you, you know, in inside of a state that was Bob all, you know, repressive and et Cetera, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          01:24:36       No holds a go. One word answer, rebellion. Now would I have the mentality that I have right now if I grown up in one of those repressive states? Probably not. I'd probably just want to survive and get some more bread. Yeah, right. I might not just be thinking, Hey, there's, there's something more important than me and that's freedom and it does it. Maybe I wouldn't think that. Maybe I'd just be thinking, Hey, I want some, maybe I can get an extra 20 grams of bread. It Olga. Dang. All right. Back to the book in this is good. In the proximity of death, things appeared in their true light and proper order. In such a situation. The Bible speaks to us with an insistence and clarity, the like of which we had never felt or understood before. The fear and misery at the edge of our existence had given us a religious experience who strength giving power bound us together.

Speaker 2:          01:25:36       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:25:36       so he's starting to see really there's no atheists in a foxhole. Guess what? According to Weeder, that's a very accurate statement. Among my favorite books in the little private library I'd taken with me to the eastern front was a copy of Marcus Aurelius is self observations.

Speaker 2:          01:25:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:25:58       I too had often found support and comfort in it. It had contributed markedly to completing my equipment for war by serving me as a suit of armor that protected me from all too frequent woundings by events and giving me an inner equanimity. Now, this book too, like several others had become meaningless. The wisdom of the world, the wisdom of the world with it's merely human, temporal comfort had failed. It did not penetrate into the ultimate and most profound and could no longer stand firm in the terrible shock and helplessness whose mercy I felt myself to be in in extreme distress with the ground shaking under foot and a menacing abyss of nothingness seeming to open before me. There was only one last support, the comforting strength of the Christian belief. Perhaps we could pass some of this comfort and support on two other comrades who bewildered. We're wheeling toward the abyss in their desperation faced with the destruction of a whole world of concepts. In an a view of the senseless senselessness of the catastrophe. Many a soldier on the staffs as well as within the fighting troops had reached for his pistol to put an end to his life.

Speaker 2:          01:27:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:27:26       There was no way back and no escape other disguise their secret fear and inner feelings of emptiness behind a contrived soldierly stance or even deliberately assume to the cast of mind of a language neck,

Speaker 1:          01:27:42       which is like these guys were these old school German mercenaries that were super hardcore. If they themselves were doomed to go under, they would at least sell their skin so dearly to the end and take as many Russians with them as they could. That's interesting. He's, he's projecting on these soldiers that you know, that they're disguising their secret fear. You know what I'm telling you right now, that some of those Nazi German soldiers, they were, they were getting after it, right? They weren't, they weren't hiding their, their secret fear by acting tough. They were ready to die for the fewer. Hmm. So let's not just paint with a broad brush there. In my opinion. If uh, we agreed that suicide was out of the question for religious and ethical reasons. As normal week human beings caught up in error and guilt, there was nothing left to, to us put to drink the cup of suffering to the last bidder drags.

Speaker 1:          01:28:49       Yeah. In the meantime, something unbelievable. It happened and made quickly made. The rounds are quartermaster. A still young general staff officer had suddenly disappeared. His driver who had taken him to the gum rack air had waited in vain for his return. The lieutenant colonel was missing. He had silently left Stalin. Rod left the Stalin Grad pocket, the zone of death and destruction on his own initiative. Probably it was a mixture of nerves, fear, cowardice in the vain hope that in the general confusion he might be able to fly out and save his life that attempted him to dessert. The commanding general had made inquiries by radio that earning staff officer had shown up at army group claiming the flown out on official assignment from the core on matters of supply. Our general was wild with indignation and rage. He declared that he would have the criminal flown back into the pocket and shot before our eyes. We were all deeply depressed and into with an anticipated with horror the terrible scene that had been announced and which we were spared to our relief. Our quarter master was shot outside the pocket on the spot where in his fatal weakness he had hoped to find a door to freedom in life. So again, even though I just talked about some of the Nazis being committed to the end, there was many of them that were just trying to get the hell out of there.

Speaker 1:          01:30:10       Back to the book, our commanding general spoke openly of the impending collapse, accusing lean with bitterness and secret anger. He pointed out that it was not our fault. We had gotten into this devil, this situation of a catastrophe from which there was no longer a means of escape. Okay? Here he is, the commanding general is now saying, hey look, this is not our fault. So he so clearly, he's obviously not taking any ownership of this, but w w okay, so it's only ask you this. Okay, Jocko, what would it, how would it help him if he was to take ownership of it right now? Right. If he was to say, Hey, this is my fault. It wouldn't help them. Could, could. If he was to say, Hey, look, this is my fault. This is why this happened. Would that help him right now? No, you're right.

Speaker 1:          01:30:55       It wouldn't help them. What did have helped him a month or two months ago, if he said to himself, look, we're in this situation, I need to take ownership of it and get it fixed. Would it have helped? Then you're damn right. It would have who said, you know what? Hitler might not tell them. It might be telling us not to break out. Guess what? Hitler's not here. We're going to break out. I'll go get shot for defying his orders. That's fine. I'll save all of you. That's, that's where ownership would've come in, but what he said was, look, we're, we're, we're, we're assigned to our faith. I talk about this all the time. Just because the boss tells you or doesn't give you the support that you need or gives you a bad order. That doesn't give you the excuse. You can't put the ownership on the boss and you're the one in charge.

Speaker 1:          01:31:35       You take ownership of it, you get the problem solved. He didn't do that. So he, he's, I don't want to see allowed to say it's not our fault, but he okay. Him saying it's not our fault is kind of a different circumstance. Why? Because they're past the point of no return. If they're doomed already. Yes. Cause they don't have any, uh, you know, take responsibility and then take responsibility for the fixing the mistake. There is no fixing the mistakes anymore. That's why if I was him, yeah, I would've said, hey guys, it's not your fault that you're here. This is my fault. I should have made a maneuver. I should have stood up to the boss. I didn't. Here's what we're going to do now to defend ourselves the best of our ability. Right. Right. So then that would still give the guys some breathing room.

Speaker 1:          01:32:21       Right. Some psychological breathing room. Yeah, they fought hard. They did their best. It's my fault. I should have. I should have. How'd you guys do something different and I didn't. Here's what we're going to do now. The fact that he, that these, that he wasn't taking ownership earlier, the fact that he's able to blame now means he was able to blame earlier and if you're, the minute you start blaming, you're not solving anything. You're not getting things done. There you go. Yeah, back to the book, but he left no doubt that together we still had a task to perform, namely namely to fulfill our soldierly duty duty til the last moment in obedience to the orders from above. We will defend our perimeter fighting shoulder to shoulder with our carbines to the last bullet from his words, we could surmise that he was staunchly determined to go down like a captain with his ship and not to survive the downfall of his troops on equivocally. He pointed out that the commandments of the traditional ethical code of the soldier now demanded our ultimate sacrifice without Demir.

Speaker 3:          01:33:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:33:26       Now at this point he's supposed to go out and do a do like a Rocana sense of the lines and see what's going on and when he's up there. Here's what he sees in freezing cold and wild snow fury flurries, I wrote across the decile at battlefield on a motorcycle together with a sergeant of the military police, we soon reached a road of catastrophic. We soon reach the road of catastrophe or rising dark gray against the backdrop of a snow bounce step marked by all kinds of abandoned rubbish. Half covered cadavers of horses and wrecked vehicles, scattered pieces of equipment, crates destroyed weapons, the dispersed, the starving, the freezing, the sick, but all those still fit for fighting. Had only one objective to which they were attaching their last glimmerings of hope. And this objective was stolen Grad in the protective walls of the sellers of the ruins.

Speaker 1:          01:34:18       They might still be able to find some warmth, food, rest, sleep and salvation. And so they streamed by the remains of the shattered and decimated formation trains and rear echelon services with vehicles that were slowly being dragged and pushed by wounded, sick and frost bitten men. There were a May, she did figures among them muffled and coats rags, pitiful rex, painfully dragging themselves forward, leaning on sticks and hobbling all along the fruit on frozen feet, wrapped in wisps of Straw and strips of blankets drifting along through this storm. This was the wreck of the sixth army that had advanced to the vulgar during the summer. So confident of victory, men from all over Germany doomed to destruction in a far off land. Mulian during their suffering. Tottered in pitiful drove droves through the murderous eastern winter. These were the same soldiers who had formerly marched through the large parts of Europe's as proud conquerors. Now the enemy was at their backs and deaf looked everywhere. There's an interesting piece that I don't go into too much, but this guy had written a paper and presented it up the chain of command with, uh, talking about what happened to Napoleon.

Speaker 3:          01:35:51       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:35:52       And he got kind of told like, hey, that's not going to happen to us. Back to the book, the events of 1812 seem to be repeating themselves after all. Once again, the uncanny Russian space was swallowing many tens of thousands of human beings despite Napoleon's experience. The basic elements of geography and meteorology had again been ignored to a frightening degree. On top of that, the modern superstition that with the help of machines and motors, the possible could be accomplished and the dangers of space overcome had also contributed to our downfall and it a fatal pack with the overestimation of mechanized means of bore had stood the misapprehension of the limits of human strength and possibilities. Yeah. Repeat

Speaker 1:          01:36:38       Tizzy. Yeah. That was another one of those classic lines. That's not gonna happen to us. Oh yeah. I mean it feels like, yeah, that's a classic mistake. It's called ego called lack of humility. Don't worry, that won't happen to us. It happened to Napoleon, one of the greatest, you know, military leaders of all time. But it won't happen to us because we have some cars. Yeah, we've got some tanks or whatever, but by the way, tanks, tank, fuel, where's that fuel going to come from? I mean, at least a horse can eat a piece of Hay, right? Sure. You know, there's no Exxon station out there on the steps back to the book together with several wounded, we dragged ourselves onwards until exhausted in shattered. We finally reached the ruins of rubble of northern Stalin Grad City area, so now he's actually was retreating back to Stalin Grad itself.

Speaker 1:          01:37:30       What travails did fate still hold in store for us? Deaf who might face more often and closely in recent days than ever before, it was still refusing me, but his trusted companion for many weeks, hunger was tormenting me with tenacious power. Slowly making me write for the end and frost. The third murderer in the trio had also bitten me by now as the constant stabbing pains. Some of my limbs warned me separate from our staff. Our Group of officers found shelter and a dark dirty seller while our men went to ground in a neighboring pile of rubber rubble. This was to be the end of our flight and our last quarters. The army had once again addressed itself too. Okay. H and pointing adamantly to the catastrophic situation had asked for immediate permission to surrender.

Speaker 2:          01:38:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:38:24       Which might possibly prevent still complete disillusion, disillusion, and total disaster. Hitler's answer had been a steely no for bid surrender. Hitler had radioed into the pocket on 25 January. The army will hold its position to the last man and bullet.

Speaker 2:          01:38:48       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:38:49       Imagine being that freezing hungry, tortured by the enemy at your back. And you got some guy in a nice, ridiculous,

Speaker 4:          01:39:05       it's one thing to be like, yeah, we're going to the last minute, the last bullet, and it's this big war, but it lasts. You know, I don't know, a week not even though we eat or like that, that one big last stand and we're gonna fight to the death. That's one thing. And I dig it and that's, you know, but just weeks and weeks and weeks of to slowly dying of starvation in sickness in this way, different it's way different to try to fight til the last man in the last bullet in that sentence scenario.

Speaker 1:          01:39:34       Yeah. Especially because they, they all kind of know that there's no strategic advantage to what they're doing. In worse.

Speaker 1:          01:39:44       Back to the book Colonel General Policy and his chief of staff who's fanatical wheel to hold out was well known among the staff's relentlessly held onto their fatal decision on their part. Many generals and their staffs remain the executioners of the orders of destruction under the sorry circumstances for fighting, suffering and dying continued torturing Lee and terribly after the splitting of the pocket. The death agony of the army continued for a further week in the general disillusion and catastrophe. It was every man for himself more and more order and discipline broke down here and there and the sellers. This still able bodied in combat, worthy hid among the second wounded cases of uncommon rod really conduct theft of provisions, refusal to obey orders and open mutiny mounted a little late. The elementary drive of self preservation no longer allowed the question of right or wrong to be raised and in the same way that the differences between the front line and rear line ash, then the rear echelon we're being erased. So were the differences in rank and position. In the final days. Summary Law was imposed and stolen Grad with drastic punishments for any crime. Looters were to be shot within 24 hours. Hundreds of German soldiers who had become weak in their misery thus became victims of German bullets.

Speaker 3:          01:41:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:41:18       One could no longer generally speak of courageous and heroic fighting. Certainly here and there there were individual deeds of courage, personal initiative and noble self, self sacrifice, but by and large, only a mute submission to the inescapable fait remained to the bitter end.

Speaker 3:          01:41:38       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:41:38       it was rather the silent hero wisdom of acceptance of suffering and submitting not the picture that gets painted very often. Now at this point, at this point right now in this battle is when they hear that speech that goring said, talking about this great sacrifice and how they fought so well and how they'll be remembered forever and compared them to Leah [inaudible] and the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae. It's just, and here's what these guys thought with overexaggerated feverish PAF us the see the speaker recalled the heroic example of the last of the goths, and in the end, the historical, so famous sacrifice of the Spartan heroes at Thermopylae who had not fall faulted or given ground until the last fighter had fallen. And so it was at Stalin Grad, just like Leah nighties and his loyal men and the Greek defile. So with the German heroes lie on the vulgar as the law of honor and conduct in war commanded them to do for Germany during this speech full of empty phrases and lies that outdated itself in hysterical glorification and praises the demeanor of the deeply delusioned and incensed. Adios became more and more hostile.

Speaker 3:          01:43:06       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:43:06       The glances, gestures and words all around on mistakenly showed the rage that was growing in people's souls. Whoever might still have trusted in the promise of help from the outside now had to recognize with growing horror that at home where relatives still hope for a union. The warriors of Stalin Grad had finally been written off.

Speaker 3:          01:43:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:43:28       We felt that we had heard our own funeral oration before its time. The disgusting adulation of the torture is dying of our army and the deceitful glorification of conditions that were against all laws of humanity filled me with indignation and revulsion. Must not going w goings words if pierce the hearts of our loved ones at home like daggers and rob them of all hope now that they had been thrown into the most anxious fears of art for our lives at home, we had been declared dead. The hero is Asian and mythical glorification of our stolen Gratta army was supposed to conceal the sad truth for a long time. Now the our relic tale of the German soldier drama vulgar had become an irresponsible mass dying ordered from on high. The pathetic propaganda of glorification was obviously intended to distract from the catastrophic consequences of a criminally amateurish leadership of war. And to prevent the question of blame from even a rising.

Speaker 3:          01:44:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:44:44       So you pretty much see how these guys felt at the end. And now you might think you might think that there's a disconnect between Hitler but cape, we're proud we're fighting to the end and this is the way the Germans are and this is the way we are. We are superior.

Speaker 3:          01:45:06       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:45:07       And that the guys on the ground that they're just beat down. And so maybe they're just, maybe they're just weak. Right. And they're just given up. You might think that you might think that here's, this will give you a little indication that, that that's the wrong thought on the one February, the new spread among us, that Paula's had capitulated with his staff and the two southern segments of the pocket and gone into captivity. So the leader just surrender. At the last moment he had been promoted to field marshal. This promotion in the hour of the final catastrophe was grotesque. It was simply a gesture of thanks from above and a good buy. So Hitler thought the policy was going to die. Well, he didn't Paulus surrendered, but the unhappy field, Marshall Marshall did not set the example of heroism expected of him from the top. The German papers broadcasts later broadcast, Slater tried to spread the impression of the style of goring speech that in the face of overwhelming superiority, the field marshal had burned his secret papers and that the general line behind their machine guns had fought to the end.

Speaker 3:          01:46:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:46:20       Furthermore, after the catastrophe, German magazines lied to the German people with fake pictures, so showing such heroic scenes,

Speaker 3:          01:46:29       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:46:29       but the truth of the matter was something quite else. We calculated that more than 15 generals and their staffs had gone into captivity from the southern and central pockets soon mosque. Soon the Moscow radio gave details of numbers and names. I was only to learn later that some of these generals had gone into captivity with neatly packed suitcases and plentiful baggage. They simply stopped fighting and gave themselves up to the victor without any further consideration for the fate of the remaining battle groups. The last request of the field marshal had been that the Russians should treat him as a private citizen. With this, he had resigned at the official role, either formally played in the military, political interest of the supreme commander, and as a broken man laid down his martial ship, he was driven away in a closed car and no longer needed to see the appalling misery of his sacrificed army.

Speaker 2:          01:47:31       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:47:32       so there's no disconnect. The troops on the ground, we're right. These leaders were liars week and they had no problem.

Speaker 2:          01:47:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:47:48       Pursuing glory with someone else's ass, but they weren't ready to do with their own. Deep down inside, I had increasingly begun to oppose certain military concepts of obedience, honor and discipline, like those that had been manifesting themselves to the end in the measures taken by our command. Was this only the, so this is, this is a week we went through all this and he's like the only, now he's starting to oppose some of some of his, his military concepts of obedience. If this was was an American, do you Americans are rebellious by nature like we don't, we don't. You know, if you, if you're leading us down the wrong path, we stand up and say like, no, you're not going to do that. Stop. No, he's, you know, here going, well, they've done all this and know now am I starting to question these things? And he even questioned his question back to the book was this only the revolt of my selfish instinct for self preservation was an omission on soldierly stance, fear of cowardice at a time when things had become bitterly serious. Precisely at this point, I again remember the awkward, deeply penetrating faults and feelings with which I'd asked myself at the beginning of the war. Why and for whom must you make this sacrifice?

Speaker 1:          01:49:12       The same questions that had never really taken root roads again before me, gigantic Leanna and applicable to the whole army was there really unknowable. Hi, holy objective at stake here and solid Grad our in our battle, an ethically justified goal which could be served by ultimate human human test of giving one's life. Did soldierly honor and obedience to orders really justify this demand so casually made of us that we hold out for this lost cause, this excess of suffering and dying. Was this immeasurables sacrifice really decisive for the outcome of the war and could it serve our country and our people?

Speaker 1:          01:50:00       This is what this is. You want to know why we talk about the wire all the time? Yeah, there it is. Yeah. Now he should have been asking that question a long time ago and he said he started to, in the beginning he started to ask that question, but he didn't go through with it. You know why? Because they were winning. They were winning. Dz Don't really need to know why, where I could go out there, you know, beat this country, beat that country, roll through that country. It's pretty easy not getting tested. Yeah. Back to the book of foreboding, I had long held, grew into a terrible certainty. What was happening here in Stalingrad was a tragic, senseless self sacrifice, a scarcely credible betrayal of the final commitment and devotion of brave soldiers are innocent. Trust had been misused in the most despicable manner by those responsible for the catastrophe.

Speaker 1:          01:50:48       We had been betrayed, led astray, and condemned. The men of stolen Grodd were dying in betrayed belief and in betrayed trust in my heart, the bitter feeling of and all for nothing became ever more torturing in my soul arose again. The whole a bismal disaster of the war itself more clearly than ever. I appreciated the full measure of misery and wretchedness of the other countries in Europe too, which German soldiers and German arms had brought boundless misfortunes. So he's reflecting and he's looking around and saying, look what we did. All these other countries. How do we, not so far the Victor's been all too prone to close our eyes and our hearts and to forget that always an everywhere. The issues we're living, human beings, their possessions and their happiness. So, like you said, he turned a blind eye. He rolled through all these countries. He did all that evil.

Speaker 1:          01:51:44       Probably only a few among us had entertained the fault that the suffering of the thought that the suffering and dying being caused by our, sorry, profession of war would one day be inflicted upon us. We had carried our total war into one region of Europe after another, and thereby destructively interfered with the destinies of foreign nations far too little. We had asked the reason why, the necessities and justifications for what was happening or reflected on the immeasurability of our political responsibility, that these entailed misery and death had been initiated by us, and now we were inexhaustibly coming home to roost day were in exorbitant, coming home to roost. The step on the dawn and the vulgar had drunk streams of precious human blood. The Russians were certainly also making cruelly high blood sacrifices in the murderous battle of Stalingrad, but they who were defending their country against a foreign aggressor knew better than we why they were risking their lives. So yeah, the Russians, they're fighting, they're dying for sure, but they know that they're defending their homeland. It's a lot easier for them to understand. Many officers and commanders now began to oppose the insane orders and emanating from the fewer headquarters and being passed on by army command. By this they had, they began to reject the long eroded military concepts of honor and discipline to which the army leadership at clung until the end in the unconditional obedience, such, such as was fatally being upheld here in Stalin Grad, there was no longer a soldierly stance, but rather a lack of responsibility.

Speaker 1:          01:53:39       So I'm gonna say that one more time. This idea that unconditional obedience was, was, was not seeing right now as a soldierly stance, but a lack of responsibility because you are responsible to do something if, if you're getting bad orders, you're responsible for not obeying them. And you know, I get asked this question all the time, not all the time, but you know, sometimes people say, what if you got, what did you do if you ever got told something that you didn't believe it? I was like, well, we were home the same page. Like it's not like we were getting told to do things that were immoral, unethical. You're, they weren't saying, Hey, go burn this village with women and children. We weren't getting those orders. He, you know what I mean? We weren't getting told to do things that,

Speaker 3:          01:54:25       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:54:27       that weren't, that I didn't agree with that. That my guys didn't agree with and that's the way the mill are there. Are there pockets where things happened? Yeah, absolutely. That's what, that's the horrors of war. But if we got told to do things that we didn't think we should do, we just said, no, not doing it.

Speaker 3:          01:54:45       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:54:49       This was open mutiny. So they've gotten to the point now flying me since they were no more orders from the center towards the end. Many responsible commanders and unit leaders on the line acted on their own initiative and in an endeavor to stop the senseless shedding of blood. Many desperate Stalin Grad warriors in the end sought a way out by suicide or by voluntary, by a voluntary soldiers death. We learned of two generals who extremes who's extreme resolution had been shattering. One, the commander of a division from Dresden had shot himself after having ordered his son, a young lieutenant, to report to him to say farewell. The other, the commander of a division from Lower Saxony who's tactical emblem was a four leaf clover and was known therefore as the lucky division who did not want to survive. The downfall of his men had been killed on the frontline while standing erect and firing his weapon. The last pockets of resistance, what was left of about six shattered divisions and the remnant of other formations that had meanwhile been left to their fate by the resignation of the army command now had to bear the whole burden of the concentrated air attacks, artillery and mortar fire.

Speaker 1:          01:56:08       It was not only the fear of the coming end, the hunger clawing at my intestines and the pain from my frozen limbs that turned the last seemingly endless hours and the Stalin Grad pocket into the tortures of Hell for me. The proximity of death toward the last obscuring veils from my eyes and brought fruits of long years of individual experiences, observations, tormenting feelings and thoughts into an instant maturity.

Speaker 2:          01:56:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:56:38       Now on the very edge of being war in it's for us,

Speaker 2:          01:56:45       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:56:45       most terrible form became the inexhaustible revealer of all things, but he's going through like spiritual awakening as he faces death in my mind's eye, the horrible experiences and pictures of destruction that would not leave me in peace. By Day or night. We're strung together in a bloody chain experiences and impressions, stretching foreign to the past. That's suddenly a woke in my sharp and memory. I discovered to be logically connected links of this fatal chain. What had formally always caused me to have nasty premonitions and apprehensions. What it always disquieted me, I now suddenly had a recognized as having been the warning of a fatal fundamental evil. The dimensions of which I had fought, not fought possible now faced with the eminently impending catastrophe. The question about the sense of what was happening had played me so often during the war, seized me again with cruel force. Hundreds of thousands of flowering human lives were suddenly being senselessly snuffed out here in Stalin Grad. What an immeasurable wealth of human happiness. Human plans, hopes, talents for tile. Possibilities for the future were there by being destroyed forever.

Speaker 2:          01:58:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:58:18       The criminal insanity of an irresponsible war management with it's superstitious belief in technology and it's utter lack of feeling for the life, value and dignity of man and here prepared for us. Oh Hell on earth.

Speaker 2:          01:58:41       How could the

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       long eroded concepts of honor, duty, obedient soldierly hair wisdom figure any longer into our feelings, thoughts and actions to stay alive, to be reunited once again with our loved ones at home. This burning desire was now the drive behind all thoughts and actions. Gradually we had accustomed ourselves to the, to the idea of surrendering at the first opportunity and going into Russian captivity. In the end, I basically had only one wish to stay alive and healthy and go into captivity on wounded. So that's it goes into captivity. Um, you know, after going through a, uh, I don't know if you want to call it a spiritual awakening of recognizing that his whole life had been doing something evil. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:59:42       In the end it's, it's pretty anticlimactic how it happens, how they get, how they end up in captivity. Back to the book in the early minutes of captivity, I felt an easing tension and relief. In the end, the insecurity of our situation between life and death had weighed down on all of us, like led what first attracted my attention. So now they're captured in what first attracted my attention. Imagine this was the fresh healthy appearance of the victors. They're simple enviable winter clothing in good weapons, son, sub machine guns everywhere. And the uniform picture of sheep skins. Padded jackets felt boots and for caps with broad earmuffs swinging up and down the warmly bundled up, well nourished and splendidly equipped men of the Red Army with their chunky, mostly red cheeked faces formed a stark contrast to our death. We Pale, filthy bearded and freezing figures of misery who Hong exhausted and sick and their makeshift winter clothing consisting of all kinds of furs, blankets, scarves, field gray, head gear, woolens and inadequate foot gear. This sudden meeting and comparison at once showed me how low we had sunk and how little we had been prepared for this murderous battle

Speaker 1:          02:01:11       than the Soviets. The Russians kind of have their shots at him. Fritzy Fascist Hitler caput. They alternated threats and obviously dreadful. Kurt curses and contemptuous spit like raging wolf to vengeful soldiers from the rear echelons fell on the helpless victims time and time again to steal personal baggage and to vent their spleen. So now they're captured in though the Russian start to kind of sing and dance and singing the old folk songs back to the book. All the noise and exuberant surrounding me formed a shrieking contrast to the inner and outer state, which I found myself torn from my circle of comrades left to myself and my emotions. In the midst of the joyful dancing and singing victors with whom no contact could be established in my inner heart, I felt abandoned and without hope, totally depressed, uprooted, caught off from home, sunk far away, subjugated to a foreign will, pytest sleep piteous Lee thrown to the mercy of an unknown powers to be dependent on the whim of the victor constantly watched menacingly surrounded by barbed wire and guns forced to relinquish to any kind of external freedom captivity, men on an unknown form of human submission and humiliation.

Speaker 2:          02:02:46       Okay?

Speaker 1:          02:02:47       It is a bounty for us human beings that a merciful hand covers the future from our eyes with an impenetrable veil. That's a really great line. Had I known then that I was destined for more than seven comfortless years devoid of love and filled with previously unknown mental and physical tortures and fearful uncertainties on the borderline of life. I never would have found the strength to say Stan, the sufferings of the initial hard months of captivity. He's saying if he would've known what the future held seven years he's about to be in captivity for,

Speaker 1:          02:03:33       he wouldn't have even made it through. He would have given up and he doesn't talk in this book about what that imprisonment was like, but he does give what I think is a combination of how we survived it and what he learned from it. Going back to the book time and again, I was soothingly distracted from my tormenting thoughts and dark visions by the wonders of the brightly shining star filled winter sky that appeared to be so close to the touch. It constantly drew my eyes upwards as if by magical force what its so far appeared to me as the downfall of a world come loose at the seams and a catastrophe without bounds suddenly took on measurable dimensions. I regained my equilibrium and found my way back to myself where I felt earlier that chaos was swallowing me up. Now, calm and peace was flowing into my disquieted heart. The reconciling effect came from the vast order and harmony that the sparkling, massive bright stars with their eternal laws of the universe brought back to my attention. A new

Speaker 2:          02:04:59       okay.

Speaker 1:          02:05:00       The constellation that the stars sank into my soul was strange and hardly to be grasped by the intellect. It seemed to me as if my personal fate within the framework of events on earth was secretly included within the vast all embracing order of the cosmos for the massive survivors who had escaped from the hell of Stalin Grad. The aftermath of the tragedy lasted only for a short while.

Speaker 2:          02:05:29       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:05:29       they died in their tens of thousands during the early months of captivity. Hunger and deprivation, frost and sickness had already made them assure pray for death even before the fighting stopped

Speaker 1:          02:05:45       with the columns of prisoners. Deaf also came to the various camps of reception where terrible app epidemics raged everywhere and exact accounting of the victims of Stalin Grad according to numbers, dates, and individual fates will never be made. The few that were allowed to begin a new life at home and in freedom after long years of captivity, we'll always have to ask themselves how they can justify the deaths of the others by their own existence, how they can uphold and fulfill the legacy of their dead comrades. But all Germany must also loyally remember, it's many, many sons that lie at rest in the distant Russian step and try today and in the future to understand they're unforgettable. Sacrifice the new broom ball mounds of soldiers, graves and stolen Grodd have long disappeared.

Speaker 2:          02:06:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:06:47       The cemeteries were leveled soon after the battle and partially converted to soccer fields.

Speaker 2:          02:06:54       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:06:54       Nothing is left of the army of simple gray crosses, but it is as if a great invisible cross. We're rising there on the Volga casting its shadow over our nation and addressing penetrating admonishing words.

Speaker 2:          02:07:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:07:18       To all of our hearts. And that closes out this book with with some penetrating in admonishing words a for us because there's a lot of warnings in this book. Warnings that we must pay attention to and if we don't pay attention to them, then who will?

Speaker 2:          02:08:03       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:08:04       warnings. The lessons here, first of all, as a nation, as a culture, we have to look at the way things fell apart in Germany or maybe you look at the way things came together slowly like we talked about, the traditional values were we're moved aside and they were replaced with these new values, values that allegedly protected the German citizens.

Speaker 2:          02:08:35       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:08:36       they were values that we're going to make the world a better place and he uses this term, this political religion. That's a powerful thought.

Speaker 2:          02:08:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:08:50       Political religion took hold and then he used that term presumptuous beliefs that countered the foundation of their existing cultures and beliefs. So there's some arrogance involved that we have people that aren't even listening to the counter arguments. I think we have to be careful not to abandoned the structures of the past in some kind of a race to move to the future because the future, it hasn't been tested by thousands and thousands of years of human evolution. And I understand,

Speaker 2:          02:09:36       okay

Speaker 1:          02:09:37       that we, I'm not saying we don't progress, but I'm not saying we don't evolve, but I'm saying you don't bow down and you don't submit. You got to think about the direction that we're heading. And as citizens, as people, we have to have the courage to stand up before we reached the event horizon from which there's no return. So now on a smaller level, the lessons from this book as, as a, as a person in business or in the military or in any team as a subordinate and we're all subordinate to someone, we have to question our leaders and, and I say that all the time.

Speaker 2:          02:10:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:10:29       If we don't agree with that plan or don't agree with a tactic, you, you've got a question leadership when you got out, raise your hand. But if we know that the intent of our leadership is malevolent or it's going to cause suffering, human suffering on a grand scale, on a minor scale,

Speaker 2:          02:10:51       okay,

Speaker 1:          02:10:51       you have to, we have to say no and do what is right. No matter the consequence, no matter the consequence and you don't. Finally for us as individuals,

Speaker 2:          02:11:19       okay,

Speaker 1:          02:11:20       we got to remember that we are in charge of our own lives. We are leading our own lives and where are you leading yourself? What are you doing that you know you shouldn't be doing? Why are you doing that? What attached roughy are you heading toward? You don't have to be heading towards that catastrophe. You have the opportunity to prevent catastrophe in your own life. But in order to do that, once again, you have to stand up. You have to do the right thing, you have to be comfortable. You have to impose the discipline on your own life so you don't have something else imposed, something bad in posts so you don't have a catastrophe imposed on your own life. Because when we avoid the discomfort and when we avoid the discipline and when we avoid doing what we know is the right thing to do, that's when you end up in a personal catastrophe, in your own personal hell, in your own personal stolen Grotte you have to do.

Speaker 2:          02:12:51       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:12:51       The hard thing, the thing you know is right. And do you know what is right and you know what you are supposed to do. So do it and avoid going down a path that leads

Speaker 2:          02:13:16       yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:13:17       To your own personal health and instead,

Speaker 2:          02:13:23       yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:13:23       Get on the path that leads to freedom.

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       I think that's all I've got for tonight's. So Echo. Speaking of doing the right thing. Sure. Maybe you could give us some ideas, um, on how we can, you know, continue down the right path doing what we know we're supposed to do. Sure, sure. The part where you said, you know, you're less likely to raise any questions or you're more likely to turn a blind eye when you're winning. You remember when you said that, that like on them we use boiler room. Am I wrong? No, no, no, you're right. Yeah. So the guys, there's a part where he's in there waiting to go to a party or something, you know, they're, they're selling stocks, right? And they're, they're like garbage stocks or whatever. Inflating them. Yeah. They're like, yeah, all this pump and dump. Yeah. And so they're in the car going to some party and he's like, hey, it was, who was it, Giovanni, whatever the actors' names.

Speaker 4:          02:14:36       Are they a, he's like, Hey, he goes, do you ever wonder how, how we get these big commissions on these? You know? And he's like, that's the wrong question to ask. You know? He's like, wait, what do you mean? He's like, he's like, just, just don't ask that question. Basics. He said, don't ask that question. He goes, don't you like the way things are going? He's like, yeah, but I do. I do, but don't you ever wonder? He's like, no, I like being a millionaire. Same exact thing. When you're winning, it's easy to turn the blind eye, you know? Good point. Yeah, man. So, I mean, I guess that can apply to, well, it's interesting that you point that out and I think that, um, like on a personal level, right? Let's say you're doing really good. Yeah. It's then it can be tricky for people to do the right thing to, cause that's why we see like these a celebrity like movie stars or celebrities, athletes or whatever.

Speaker 4:          02:15:24       Man, they do some dumb stuff, right? They do some dumb stuff because they're winning. They're thinking they're good. They can do whatever they want. They make the wrong choice. Yeah. You dinner on the evening news doing dumb stuff that ruins them. Yeah. And I mean their own personal stone, God puts him in hell. Yeah. Even, yeah. With money too, you know, you know, like in celebrity types and you know, athletes who you are and just people, people who get a good job with their business blows up or whatever. Yeah. Any, any type of winning we could look at it doesn't mean you're necessarily doing the right thing. It's harder. My point is, and I think you're saying the same thing. Yes. It can be harder to do the right thing when you're winning because you just think you're good to go. You get arrogant. Yeah, yeah, let's not, let's not put brakes on this training here.

Speaker 4:          02:16:12       Just let it all fly kind of thing. And then when the train kind of loses momentum, meanwhile, all those, those things that you've been ignoring, they're still there. You know? Look at your empty bank account. You spent all that money you're supposed to keep. It would be for you made money or money. You were budgeting, right? You're budgeting, you're surviving, you're budget and you're doing, you started making all this. When he started spending all this money, all the money stopped coming in and your budget is God just saying that's what happens. Sometimes. You can't happen. Also pay now or pay later. I remember that one. That was a good one that you said. Yeah. Did I say that? Yeah. Pay Now or pay later. We're, I think we're talking about like working out or something. Just like, I didn't say it today though. No, no, no, no.

Speaker 4:          02:16:53       Pay Now or pay later for sure. Stuck with nonetheless support. Yeah. For sure. Hundred percent good way to avoid going down your personal, I don't know. Maybe it does. Maybe it doesn't. It nonetheless, if you're in the mood to support and listen your own personal style and rob. Yeah, right. But I dunno why supporting would like prevent that, you know, you're not. No, we go deep for, but nonetheless you don't remember, you don't have any aversions to reaching, you're reaching deep today. Solid grog training day. No, those are conceptually, there were the same thing. They were, I know the comparing it's, you know, most of these world, most of these like lessons I think, I feel like they're kind of everywhere. Yeah, of course. And you know, you're talking about these heavy wars and heavy like events and then you know, in my mind I'm thinking training, you know what the, you know, the idea is still hates the same.

Speaker 4:          02:17:51       There's, I think there's people out there in various states of mind share and I think that, you know, your perspective helps them maybe get maybe see some what I'm saying, cause maybe I'm, I'm hitting them from the wrong angle. So you're coming in from trading day movies. Hey Man. Yeah. Actually in the end, come to think about it. These concepts right here today when you're saying, you know, uh, you know, when it's going well, for example, when it's going good, it's easy to turn a blind eye. Isn't that kind of a lot of movies, how it is, it's like the guy does real good and he's just kinda going in it. He, he messes up in one way or another. Like pretty much, I think there's this talk by Kurt Vonnegut and I've seen it on Youtube, I think it's Kurt Vonnegut, and he's like teaching a class and you'll grab on to get his, he's teaching some class, like he just guest teaching and some classes, which is pretty awesome.

Speaker 4:          02:18:41       But he's talking about like, there's four plot lines and they're all pretty much the same. Yeah, it's pretty cool. But that's what happened. You're, you, you have nothing and then you get everything. Yeah. And then you kind of abuse it kind of. Then there's, then there's, you have nothing. You get everything, you lose everything and then you get everything back. He's just got these, it's like I forget them all, but it makes sense. They're common. Um, common storyline. They must be kind of, I mean they must be right based on real life. Like, like term, like scenarios that you go through in life. I think it's why there's things come back. Story, Cinderella story, Comeback Kid. I mean those things really under dog story triumphant. Yeah. That's how nonetheless of ear in the mood to support and you know between your movie watching escapades that the correct word escapades.

Speaker 4:          02:19:32       Yeah. Yeah. I don't recommend it. I recommend you read whatever you'd train day. Maybe we'll get you there. That was a good one I thought. Anyway. Nonetheless, origin means, isn't it weird that like training day is this movie that call, how much does it cost to make training day, I don't know, $50 million and like you can go to the library and get stolen, grabbed the book for nothing, literally nothing. Or you can buy it, you can buy it on Amazon for I think this book cost like a dollar cause it's used. But it's just kind of a strange dichotomy there. It's interesting for sure. And uh, you know, obviously we can go into why, which one is better for you? I'm going to go ahead and say that stolen grads better for you than training day. Oh, well, depends on what you get out of it.

Speaker 4:          02:20:17       You know, you know how like asking the actually people would ask me, how do you read to get the most out of it? How do you well, I read it while I'm reading it highlighted. Oh yeah. Jordan B. Peterson. I was watching something. The other said, don't highlight anything. Yeah, this is the f this. I have a major disagreement with Jordan B. Peterson. I'm not highlighting, highlighting fool. But uh, anyway, so I go through, I highlight what hits me and then I go back and reread it. And then I have the red pen to circle the important, really important on the kindle. It, you can choose your, um, your color of highlighter. So the yellow is general highlighting and then the orange nonetheless. All right, well how about this, we'll talk about some Jujitsu gies cause people ask me, yeah, what, Gee, should I get? You get origin geese.

Speaker 4:          02:21:11       That's it made in America from the threats from the cotton. That's what we say. As we all know, being an American to the shirt, dirt to the shirt. Have you said that field to finish? No, I just was up there. I was just up at the factory with Pete. I caught the Facebook live on it, on my head and my mind to this show. Is that to shame? I think it might be just like, yeah, two shirt might be field to finish hands in daylight, hands and daylight, but yeah, make some good stuff. Especially geese in America. Like I said, I'm good in Jujitsu, you know I ha I have a few geese. Ah, a few these, I don't use any of them except the origin ones go to or do you mean.com. That's where you can get your Ge Ford. You did too. They also have rash cards, compression gear.

Speaker 4:          02:21:57       Right, and that's for Jujitsu I think primarily. But you can use it for other stuff. Of course. Yeah, indeed. Big Time. Also Jocko is some supplements, good supplements. Krill oil. I was talking to [inaudible] name is Josh from Virginia Tech Training Team a couple of times there. And I think he was here for, you know, a few weeks ago whenever chain. And uh, you know, so we talk about somebody, he's young, he's 21, and he's like, oh yeah, I take fish oil. I was like, Dang, that's good. And krill oil is better than fish oil. I know this because my, I told you, I already, my dad told me all the benefits, blah, blah, blah. Nonetheless, but he's taking joint supplements at 21. He said, no, I don't have problems with my joints, but I just want to maintain this joint situation as I get older. I was like, Oh, you're way ahead of me.

Speaker 4:          02:22:52       So, um, so I give them some, uh, your, uh, joint warfare. Yeah, that's good. Uh, Pete Pete from origin. He, he's, he needs joint warfare. He can feel it dissipate in a day. And Mike, when I was with was with him, he'd be, you know, at five o'clock Nafisa Macra, hold on, I'll be right back. Irritation, germ warfare. So he said he's at the threshold. He needs it. Yeah. And that's actually, it's interesting cause you know, you can see what's selling and what's cool is you can see joint warfare, Krill oil. Like what's awesome about us, it's the repeat customers of people that order it. Then they ordered again and then they ordered again. Because you don't want her to, if you're not feeling it. Yeah, that's what I'm, that's how I am with the Krill oil. 100% like if you like I'll forget and I'll be like, you know like Oh I'll take it later.

Speaker 4:          02:23:46       I don't forget. And that, yeah, I know. Don't you have a morning routine and whatever. And that's the thing. That's the thing doesn't include just wake up, boom, boom, boom from your medicine cabinet open my, all my stuff is right there. Not to go too deep, too deep into my routine. But during the week it's, you know, wake up and then there's like my daughter's four and a half, she has school. So there's that situation going on. This is nice. This does not interfere with you getting up and taking some pills for before you brush your teeth. Kind of not see that's the thing. The routine doesn't allow for me to take them before I've actually, it's part of, it's the routine is the routine, the routine. Because for me, if you gotta you gotta you gotta take the pills before you brush your teeth. Cause when you brush your teeth you got the strong men in there and it makes the water like too cold in your teeth.

Speaker 4:          02:24:34       Yes. He and I liked that. I think it's more refreshing. I need to harden up a little bit. Maybe Jack, probably nonetheless. Sometimes I forget three, four and if you forget for like four days and you're still working out or whatever, you'll feel it. I will feel it. So same thing Crilly I need it. Yup. I had Lafe actually, actually Jenna, Jenna brought me Krill oil. I know that Bro. That's okay. And I don't want to ask for seventh panic. My crew oil bring me some, I don't want to do that, but probably the most important level seven panic mode. Yup. Nonetheless, Krill oil vector, Krill oil, Krill oil supercrew has a super, super krill. It's not normal crowd super. And there's many reasons for that. You can find out on the website or do you mean.com if you want to know those exact reasons.

Speaker 4:          02:25:24       Also joint warfare, that's for your joints. Maintain your body structure while you're working out. Good call cause it does dissipate. I didn't want to use the word dissipate, but what do you call it? Degenerate. Degenerate. Sure. After time when you've, when you go hard in the paint it does. Unless like I said, they got compression gear, gies rash guards, most stuff, hoodies, which may or may not be the most comfortable. Hoodies and pants by the way. The sweatpants. Joggers, joggers, yes. So the the other day I'm like okay, I'm exporting some special effect that I did. So I'm like, shoot, when you export it's like you can't really use that program. You know you can exit by me. It's a long story. But so I'm like okay, I'm off of my computer for, you know, it's going to take like 10 minutes. A big effect. So like I lay on the couch and have the whole origin on for whatever reason just kind of happened to, I lay on the couch and I'm like, Dang, I don't think I felt this comfortable in a long time, but it was, everything was calm.

Speaker 4:          02:26:25       That's, that's pretty bold statement because you are the experience level of comfort. I mean comfort seeker hundred percent and I evaluate you evaluate various comfort level level. It could have very well been one of the highest. I get it. It was everything. It was a couch. It was a time of day. It was the fact that they usually don't play around with one of my seal buddies for many years we were kind of just, just young, dumb frog man. We had this yellow couch that was like 14 feet long. You get, it was just kind of deal. It was like maybe five feet deep. Dang. It was like a bed. Realistically it was like five feet deep. Which ones you through the back cushions off. It was from my feet deep and it was probably 1212 feet long. And where was this in our part in your apartment.

Speaker 4:          02:27:18       Who was gold felt beat. We got it from some shop. Yeah, that's the kind you have like a lounge and something dollars for, we had one like that at Uah in the, in the football lounge. They was like, it wasn't most graspable that couch you were looking at tonight in my house. And you're like, oh that's a nice couch. That couch out there all nice. Doesn't even come close to the comfort of the old gold couch was the deal. Yeah. It's weird how like ugly like couches will be the most functionally comfortable. We had this one my wife forced us to give away and cause it was outside, he got phased out slowly. You know how you get a new couch and you're like, okay, where do we do that where I'm not going to give it away because it's too comfortable and we've had it for so long and it's like in good shape.

Speaker 4:          02:28:04       Oh. And then we get another couch for the, for the side. They're all, we know we do with this so and so. It ends up outside, you know, and he wants to get of a cow, not a couch outside. It's like it's of, you know, it doesn't, does, doesn't look good, blah, blah, blah. Give it away. But it was the most comfortable culture. I think we actually know the new ones more comfortable. I don't know what I'm talking about. Nonetheless. Back origin, go to origin main.com. That's it. That's where you get it and you can get the discipline there too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The discipline, big time. The preworkout, the pre mission remission. That remission. Yeah. She didn't say it to me. I take it before a workout. See, I don't, I take it before I do Jitsu. I take it before I have to do a podcast or I take it before I have to do like an, like a speaking event, go where I need to my brain.

Speaker 4:          02:28:51       It has to be firing. Yeah. Yeah. Could you just keep before bid? I mean, I know it has a little bit of caffeine but like I have and I think you can't, I don't think I'd strongly recommend it. Especially if you're caffeine sensitive like I am, I'm caffeine sensitive. But you drink your nine monster energy drinks a day. You can drink whatever you want from you talk a white tea cause there's a lot less caffeine. The you figure the discipline. She saw a lot of people, you know a lot of people hit me of used Jocko white tea to ween off of full strength coffee cause they don't want to be on that coffee but there's enough need caffeine. They lit a little something to wean off. It's like Methadone getting off heroin. So you might want to try that. You don't the Jocko white tea, you want to have coffee breath anymore because no one likes that.

Speaker 4:          02:29:37       Yeah, it's brilliant. It's really not like Methadone. But since the uh, the pre workout, pre mission has a cognitive enhancers, you figure, you know, when you sleep, that's like the best part of your brain or cupboard. Best time for your brain to recover. Maybe that's a little something I don't recommend it cause like I said, but you never know. Could be, could be something. I wouldn't drink it before I go to bed. Maybe when you wake up. Yeah. But I don't drink when I wake up I'll drink cause I don't drink it for, I don't drink any kind of pre workout for it before I work out, before I lift weights, before I do a metcon I don't, yeah, maybe I should, I don't know. Maybe I should try and one of the reasons cause I don't like have anything in my stomach when I'm working out.

Speaker 4:          02:31:49       You don't expect that much weight on a mount of Mace with that weird cause. The 20 pound Dumbbell, you think, oh, that's a 20 but that's not even part of the workout. I don't need to warm up with 20 pounds in any exercise.
