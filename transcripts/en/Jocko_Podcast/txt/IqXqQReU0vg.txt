Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 61 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good me. So it's been a few episodes since we got into the Q and. A. I'm sure. So today we're gonna go right into questions that come, they actually come from the interwebs. Sure. People out there. So everyone that's gives questions. Appreciate it. Thank you for the questions. I can't answer them all but talking to some people out there, if you listen to the different questions you can figure out your own answers to a lot of them. Yeah. You like learn the formulas and then you can apply. But thanks for the questions. Appreciate it. Sometimes when you,

Speaker 2:          00:00:53       in my experience anyway, when I think, okay I'm going to, I'm going to ask Jocko this question and then you either write it out or you didn't. One I remember the other day when I, when I busted out questions and when I say them out loud, it was like a few weeks ago and I say it out loud when I'm, as I'm saying it to you, I'm like, oh, I know that's already cause you know, you realize seeking, kind of utilize that hole. So you've started to get the uh, formulas in your own head and now as you're saying and be saying, oh, I know what the answer. No, yes, exactly. How do I get out of bed in the morning?

Speaker 2:          00:01:28       How do I be mentally tougher? Be Mentally tougher. All right, rock and roll. First question, go Jocko. Hydroco today I had what I believe you referred to as disciplinary breakdown. This morning I found out that I had to take additional credits in college and that I believe were completed. So he thought they were complete. He had to take more. As it turns out in a fit of rage, I took my phone and threw it across the room in frustration. I felt really good at at time, but five seconds later regretted it because now broken phone and I lost control of my emotions. So do you have any mental tricks or anything in general that you do when you're slightly irritated or outright furious? Ps, this used to happen a lot more. I started to Jitsu and haven't rolled for three weeks. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but I felt great whenever I was rolling consistently.

Speaker 1:          00:02:22       Hmm. Maybe anecdotal. However, we do know that Jujitsu soothes the soul. Uh, so, well, one of the things in mean, and you've talked about this too, when I realized that losing your temper was a sign of weakness. As soon as I read it, soon as I made that connection, I said to myself, this week I'm going to try not to do it anymore. And what's weird is when you're a kid, I don't know if you remember this, but when I was a kid and you'd see someone get angry and it made you afraid. And so for a while I saw it as like a power, you know, it's kind of a way to achieve power that you can lose your temper and then all of a sudden you have this extra strength. And so when you're a little kid, and when I say a little kid, I mean when I was 1314 years old, I thought, hey, if I go, if I could get that rage going, and people are scared, like I used to feel, that's a positive thing. And then like I said, as I got older, now you know, now you're talking 1615 1617 I realized, hey, this isn't,

Speaker 1:          00:03:36       this isn't cool. This isn't strength. It's actually a weakness. And when I realized it was weakness, and I didn't realize that overnight, but I started getting the idea that that was weakness. And now when you see someone that is in control, and even when bad things are happening there, you know, they're, they're standing stoically saying, okay, let me take another look at that and I'll get it done. You know what I mean? When they're just, okay, then you realize, okay, this guy's really unflappable, which is a lot more impressive. So again, you, you gotta be able to detach from this. And you know, I like to take pride in the fact that I'm going to keep my cool no matter what happens. And definitely once I was in that, once you're in the seal teams, you definitely want to be that guy that's keeping your, keeping your cool no matter what's happening, whether it's people or doing the wrong thing, or you just want to be the guy that's, hey, okay, come back over here.

Speaker 1:          00:04:28       We need to Redo this. You just want to be that guy that's way more impressive than the guy that says, I can't believe this. Don't be that person. So, and I've talked about this before, and what are the pre event indicators that show you or revealed to you that your temper is about to be lost? What are they? Is it you clench your fist, right? Is it you raise your voice and you start doing it, getting that stuff? Do you start to heavy breathing? Do you feel you flair your nostrils, right? Cause that's an animal thing where you're going to take in more oxygen. So you open up the nostrils cause you're about to get after it. Do you, you know, use your, does your, your head, you know, shaking or whatever. You can just like these things. What is it, what indicators do you have when you know that you're starting to feel that? And as soon as you feel that you detach, you go, oh, that's what that is. That's an indicator and it's a weakness. And I don't like weakness, so I'm not going to allow it and then know, take a breath.

Speaker 1:          00:05:33       I like to say, you know what, here's a good one. You want to, you want to get through that, that moment. Nod your head slowly in the affirmative. Right? So, so when someone's telling me something that's making me mad, I'll just slowly nod my head. Like, I understand this is the way things are. I accept this and this is calculating what my next move is going to be. Uh and then you know, you see whatever, you know, guys will count to 10 you know, you tell you a little kids that tell you a little kids when they start losing their temper, you know what you need to count to 10 count to 10 count to a hundred counter thousand, whatever did you gotta do and get control because like I said, if you're losing control it's not strength. It's a weakness.

Speaker 2:          00:06:24       Yeah. I said this before where I read this book called Mind Games. Small little book. Talked about anger management. Like if people have anger issues you realized it was low or they said it was low self as they say. Yeah. Anger issues stem from low self esteem and that was really embarrassing. You know, I didn't have anger issues but I'm saying if someone ever told me like oh you have low self esteem or something like that, that would be pretty embarrassing. I always thought and so to me I took that as an extreme, being so sensitive to the, even the expression low self esteem. Now I was like, oh I can never get angry again. It says right there, everyone gets angry, you know, so that was always on my mind. Anytime I started to feel mad, I was like, okay, I feel mad right now, but I don't want to have low self esteem so I better act.

Speaker 2:          00:07:15       Right. You know, kind of thing. And then after awhile it just became habitual. Um, but the, you know, oh I see. Like there's a difference between how you feel and how you behave. Like you fit, you have feelings, you know, but then you know, you're mad. Yeah. These mad feelings. So what are you going to go and straight up behave mad, you know? Yeah. And a lot of people do it and a lot of people we actually behave mad and justify it because that's my true feelings. But again, they're two different things, man. Don't, don't act toward your true feelings in front of everybody.

Speaker 1:          00:07:56       Good. No, not good. Not Good. Yeah. The, the, I dig it though. Like, you know, cause you know that feeling true feelings by the way. The reason I'm saying that is if you act on your true feelings all the time, you won't get the long term place where you want to be. Yeah. True feelings do not lead you to your true destination. Right? They don't want, my gosh, so don't actually, when you're fast, keep your true feelings focused on the true destination that you want to be at and the true feelings that you have of the anger and frustration and wanting to yell at somebody and all that other stupid stuff. Yeah. You know what? You end up with a broken iPhone cause you hooked it on the path. That's what you went off with. How's this

Speaker 2:          00:08:33       story time? I'll make it quick. So what am I crazy for a long time ago? Oh my name is Chris. So it's driving gets cut off or something. You know, rotary, just situation. True feelings, right? True feelings. Oh that guy. I want to beat him up. I want to, I want to hurt him. Road yells something or whatever. Maybe other guy yelled at him first. I don't know how, who started what? But they pull over, get into a fight that Chi in a way at the time that feels like the fantasy right there. Wish I could fight this guy. I hope I the store I'm going to, I hope he's right there so I can fight them. I don't know. Whatever. That's a fancy, that's your feelings. So anyway, Chris gets in a fight with this guy on the side of the road, grown adult by the way, fights the guy, tears his peck tears in.

Speaker 2:          00:09:23       Chris tells his own peck. Yes. In the fight. I Dunno if he won or lost whatever. He's coming to work a little bit. Doesn't matter. Yeah, torn Pec is his six month injury and the surgery yet, you know, can you work with a torn Pec when most of the time, probably not. You know, and all because you know the guy cut you off or wasn't going fast enough for, it was going, you know, to fat, whatever. You know, it's one of those things and that's, that's what your true feelings get you. Was she in the moment, especially when it's anger. It's weird. We'll have to explore that at some point because I know it doesn't make sense. I'm not sitting here saying everyone's suppress all your feelings. All your real feeling. Yeah. But the stupid feelings, do you have suppressed those? Let them let them manifest themselves over time for a longterm result.

Speaker 2:          00:10:09       That's going to be what you actually want in life. Usually the anger. Yeah. Anger for sure. It's wonderful, but anger, jealousy, uh, ego, all those things. Yeah. Those are all things that if you just act on them all the time, you're not going to have a good time. I'm life. I'm here to tell you and every single feeling when you're drunk next, what are those? Those are not good. Yeah. Don't act on those either. Now she wished I led a session based on the book, extreme ownership to my team at work. I'm not the leader, but everyone, including our manager, was very supportive and enjoyed the session. The challenge from a team member was, is there such thing as taking too much ownership? Why don't you start feeling guilty about not succeeding completely? This guilt would not be a good thing. Thoughts on handling this?

Speaker 1:          00:11:02       Well, there's definitely a thing. You can definitely take too much ownership, but not for that reason. And I've talked about this before, if you, if you're taking to refine, if you and I are on a team and I'm the leader and we've got a mission and I take so much ownership that I say, okay, echo, this is how we're going to do everything. You're going to listen to me, I own this and I don't give you any ownership. Now it's not your plan. And so now you don't execute it the best way and you don't buy into it and all that stuff. So that is how you take too much ownership. It takes away the no. If you take too much ownership as a leader, you take away ownership from your subordinates. And so you've taken, and again, it's that's overt ownership. If I take over ownership now, if I give you the mission and you go out and execute it and you mess it up and I say, okay, I coag didn't give you enough guidance.

Speaker 1:          00:11:44       I didn't give you the support and give you the training. I'm going to own the mistakes. I'm going to own the failure overtly. But covertly. If I'm giving you the mission, I'm going say, Hey, you take it and run with it. So that's where you need to be careful of that. But guilt for failing is not a valid cause. Not to take ownership, right? Guess what? When you fail something, yeah, you're going to feel guilty, but it's a different kind of you. It's more of a disappointment because things didn't go your way. All right, and I'll tell you when you feel guilty, when you feel guilty to me is if I know haven't done my best. I know I cut corners. I know I didn't invest the time. I know I, you know, didn't give it everything I could as a leader. That's when I feel guilty.

Speaker 1:          00:12:32       If I give it everything and I've done everything I can and I look back and of course Hines, there's going to be things that you didn't predict, right? Hindsight's 2020 we all know that there's going to be things where you look back and you say, I wish I would've made a different decision. But you have to. You have to say, okay, so what are you gonna do in the future? Be Indecisive now. Are you not going to make decisions? Even at that moment when I made the decision which, which was wrong, now that we can see hindsight, well, what were you going to do? You're going to wait and sit around and do nothing and now we get attacked. We get maneuvered on, we get the competitor moves or the enemy moves on as well. So you might feel disappointed that you made the wrong decision. You might feel that type of guilt. But w w the real guilt for me is if I, I didn't give everything I could to the situation. So that's what causes guilt to me. Now the failure,

Speaker 3:          00:13:24       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:13:25       an actual failure. It shouldn't cause that level of guilt. It should cause you to dig deep and figure out what happened and want to reattach it. That's what it should do. It should cause you to want to figure out where you failed, where your team failed, and what you can do to ensure that never happens again. If you want to call that guilt, you can call it guilt, but that is not a reason not to take ownership. You know, I might call it disappointment. It's a, what I'll call it, I'll call it motivation, you know, and I, you know, I don't throw that word around easily, but if I fail at something, I'm going to be motivated to make sure I, I get it back on back in line and get that thing squared away. So,

Speaker 3:          00:14:04       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:05       Take ownership. If you know, take ownership, get things done right. And if you fail,

Speaker 1:          00:14:14       don't feel guilty, don't get guilty, get aggressive, find the problems and get them solved. That's it. Re Attack Yemen. Makes Sense. Yeah. So the guilt is what kind of like, Dang, it's all my fault. Like knowing, you know, taking ownership for sure, but it's like, Dang, it's all my fault. This failure. Look at everyone's, I know a guy lost his commissioner on it. Right, right. Dang. That kind of guilt thing. Yeah. And you know, I say this with businesses there. Do you know, like you just said, you make someone lose their commission because you couldn't get the deal done fast enough. You couldn't give the guy the support that they needed. Now they lose commission. You can sure you can feel guilty

Speaker 2:          00:14:51       about that. Is that a reason not to take ownership of it? Absolutely not. It's a reason to take more ownership and be like, okay buddy, echo, I know you lost commission on that. Here's what I think. I let you down. Here's what we need to communicate better. Here's what I need to prepare and be ready to support you next time so this doesn't happen again. Are you with me? Right. As opposed to saying not taking ownership and saying, well, you know, Echo, that was kind of, you know, those deals don't always work out. Maybe you should prepare better. Does that make me feel good as a leader? Mouth. It makes me feel like an idiot. It's kind of like the swamps of sadness. So the swamps upset, sadness to me in when you get, don't want to visit. Those are some of the never ending story when it's basically you go through these swaps and it's super hard.

Speaker 2:          00:15:40       No, but it makes sense. It's a metaphor for life. Lisa was a movie. It's a movie. It's a classic neverending story. Yeah, the never ending story. Anyway, the swamps, the set, and it's, they're hard to walk through them. It's like, it's hard. It's a swamp. Quicksand everywhere, quick swamp, whatever. You know, they're not actually saying, but so you sync and the more you sink, the Saturday you get the set you get, the more you sink. So you gotta like, you know how you say, oh, like if someone's feeling guilty in this case or if you get sad, a lot of times you get sad and you're like, oh, I'm such a sad downward spiral. That downward spirals. Exactly. So you got to fight this thing. You got to fight this on to the sadness and get aggressive and work. It's not easy. Totally not easy.

Speaker 2:          00:16:21       That's what the why it's this one. How do they cover the fact that if you're in the swamp and you're sinking, if you panic, you'll also sync more. Oh yeah. They didn't getting aggressive cause getting aggressive might just be like thrashing around and now you're running out of breath as you're sinking. Yeah, they'd cover that now that they don't cover that, miss that on the metaphor. They now need to rethink the swan cassettes. No, no. Well I don't think that that was real in the water. You know when you're in the water. Yeah. If you get panicky, your breath is going faster. Your oxygen's going quicker, you're going to die. You have to relax. You have to learn to relax. You got to have an ax and just switch into problem solving mode. Really don't let this one, but it is true that you can go in the downward spiral and you know, we see that in people's lives, right.

Speaker 2:          00:17:13       People's lives, they, they, they mess, they lose their job. And instead of going, cool opportunity and somebody just hit me up on social media the other day, it's like, lost my job. Good. I got an opportunity to go out, find another job. I'm going to step up. Like that's what you do. Yeah. Yeah. And as opposed to boss my job, oh no, what am I gonna do? And now you start going down the downward spiral because now you can't pay your rent. Next thing you know, you're losing your, your apartment and now you, now you can't pay your car payment either and now you're losing your car. So what do we do? How does that help? Doesn't help out. Don't panic. Get aggressive.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       Figure out what you're going to do next. Take advantage of this situation. No, Dang. That's good. Next question. Next question. Can you talk about the experience of rolling with Hixon? Oh, how impressed were you? Uh, I answered this on Twitter. Someone said, how impressed were you? I responded, all caps. Impressed. So Jujitsu, I, I was, this is backing, this is, well, it's back in the dairy, so it's back in the day. And I was at team one at the time and, and so I think we're talking 95 96 maybe, maybe even. Yeah. 95 96 maybe 97 I think it was 97 and I was, yeah, it was 97 because I was working in the training department and I was into Jujitsu. What else? I was a blue belch and I wanted to go and train with Hixon. Right, because if you don't know anything about Hixon for those people that aren't Jujitsu players, Hixon is the, the, he is considered to be the best ever at Jujitsu and be above and beyond just being the best ever.

Speaker 1:          00:19:11       Hixon Gracie being considered the best ever at the sport. He has a high level of mystique about him. And you know, there's a bunch of reasons for that mystique. And there's a great story and you know where I don't, you know the story when the, the guy from Japan challenged him. Yes. Yeah. So guy from Japan, he beat one guy in Japan and his teammates said, I will fight you at any time. The guy came to Hickson's academy and challenged him to a fight and Hixon wasn't there at the time. They called, texted and said, hey, this guy from Japan's here to challenge your honor, Hickson is like, oh, I'll be there in 15 minutes. So Hixon came down, they wanted to record it and he said, no, you can't you. He goes, I will record it. I will own the video and, and we will fight now.

Speaker 1:          00:20:00       And Hixon annihilated him. And that's one of the mystique source. And actually the guy came back a little while later and brought him a show gun helmet and a Samurai sword or something like that. There's some drama before that though, I think the guy went back and was like, Yay him. And like a bunch of people beat me or a bunch of you owe me up. And they reported it and then thumb high, I forget the details, but somehow he was persuaded to tell the truth. Yeah, well they had a video of it. Hickson Hickson actually out of it in that video exists. It's still the guy told the truth and then it was, it was cool. And the other thing that's crazy. Well, the other thing that adds to the mystique of Hixon is that everybody that rolls with them every week, multiple times, five times, six times, seven time world champion, Jujitsu person rolls with them and they say, I was helpless.

Speaker 1:          00:20:54       Like guys that are winning dominating the world championships or saying, you know, he, I was helpless and he's above and beyond anybody else that I've ever rolled with. So in, you know, Hickson's now probably 50 something and he does not like rolling with the, the competitive black belts anymore. Uh, but this is, you know, five years, no, maybe 10 years ago he was, he was doing that and he wouldn't compete, but the guys would come to train with him and he'd destroy him. And there's some great stories online that a bunch of really good black belts have said. I mean, really good black belts have said, you know, I was rolling with Hickson and he just annihilated me. So this is for me. You know, I was a blue belt, but it was a pretty good blue belt, you know? Sure. A day from back in the day.

Speaker 1:          00:21:40       And this is the beautiful thing, you know, I was at, I was at seal team one. And so there's something to military, you can get no cost orders, meaning, Hey, you don't have to take leave, but we'll give you orders to go somewhere and we're not going to pay for it because you know, we don't, we're not going to waste government money or spend government money on what you want to do, but we'll let you go do it. So I got no cost orders, basically seal team one said, hey, you can go up and train. And so I did that. This is at the old Pecos street academy broken and it was weird. And the Pico Street Academy was kind of a um, a, um, it was like a dance studio or something where they would lay down mats. And I went up there, I think, I think I ended up staying up there for nine days.

Speaker 1:          00:22:23       I stayed at some crappy hotel around the corner. And when I got there, Hixon wasn't teaching. So I go there and I, you know, hey, I want to train. And the guy that was there lemole who's, uh, you know who that is, right? Yeah, it was a heroine hedos. What's his last name? Oh, I don't, I just don't have the slip. It's a little wall, right. So lemme awesome Jujitsu guy, awesome black belt. And then, you know, Hicks and Gracie black belt. And so he's teaching and he's, you know, and I was coming from Fabio Santos who's a, another Hixon black belt and you know, my, my original instructor in Jujitsu where, you know, he made all kinds of incredible Jujitsu guys. Fabio did, you know, you got it. Just all kinds. Greg trained, Dean Higgs, James Craig called. I mean all kinds of really good high level guys coming out of Fabio.

Speaker 1:          00:23:13       And then there's a whole, there's like another generation of black belts or came out of Fabio too who are all awesome Guy Tino and just a bunch of really good guy. Eric. Um, anyways, limo was another Hixon black belt and he was sort of the instructor at the school. So we, I get up there and I'm taking the classes. He teaches two classes a day or maybe three classes a day. So I'm just taking three classes a day while he's teaching, you know, one's in the day and he has one in the afternoon, he has one at night and I'm taking all the classes and I'm learning, you know, his style. And at this time, honestly the styles weren't. If you go to a different school now you can, there's a little bit more variance in styles between schools at this time, man, it was all closer to the source, right?

Speaker 1:          00:23:51       So all the styles were, so it was closer to now. Now we're actually getting beyond that because now with youtube and everything and everyone competing so much all the time, there's a much quicker transfer of energy. But five years ago, eight years ago, when you went to a different school, that was a much different style. But at this time, 20 years ago there was, there was, you know, it all came from the same source. So it was much more similar. So what I'm going to these classes to three times a day and there there's a 10, 15 people, you know, and they're good. You know, we're all probably about the same. You know, he, there might've been a purple belt or two and Lamar was awesome. Super Cool Guy, real casual guy. And so that's what the classes were like, super casual. We'd lay out the mats on the wooden floor and the dance studio and then we'd, we'd train and shoot the breeze.

Speaker 1:          00:24:41       Kind of like a Jiu Jitsu class, just laid back, little stretch, maybe learn a move or two, had some roles, little bit more relaxed. Fabio, Fabio Santos runs ease more old school and more regimented. You know, Fabio, you're going to get in there, you're gonna do your warm up and then you're going to learn some moves and then you're going to train. Um, lemme was a little bit more laid back. Cool. Chill teaching, really good stuff. So that's Monday and then Tuesday and then Wednesday and then, and then limo. I was, you know, in the afternoon on or in the evening, on Wednesday or I think it wasn't free. What day? What was like Wednesday or Thursday? I think it was a Wednesday. He's like, hey, Hickson's going to teach tomorrow night. And I was like, oh, awesome. So, so I come in Thursday night, I is, I'm pulling up in my 1990 whatever, like Dodge Caravan, pull up and minivan man.

Speaker 1:          00:25:33       And so there's a cars, more cars. And I was like, Ooh. So now I walk in in, it's, it's, there's people everywhere, right? It's crowded, it's crowded. It went from like 10 or 12 people in a class. Now we, there's like a hundred people. I'm serious. We had to lay out like all these different mats and everyone is quiet. No one's talking. It was, I was doing one day, so Hickson's there and he's, you know, like in a corner, you know, just cool, chill. And he looks at Limo and he, you know, gives him like a head nod in the multiple like, okay, well we're warming up. And I was like, okay. So everyone gets in the line, they start doing the old school that you did to work, running in a circle, silence. Like no one's saying anything. It's just silence it so you could feel the presence of Hixon.

Speaker 1:          00:26:31       There's a hundred people now, there's 10 times as many people and everyone's quiet. Everyone's serious. And then, you know, he, we get done with like a 20 minute up of stretching and exercise she has getting after it and then he gets done. He gets us all in a circle and the circle is huge. And then, you know, Hixon like walks out into the middle of the mat and then he sits in the center and you can hear a pin drop. It was, that was that. There was that awesome. And, and then he taught class. He taught class and I took notes. Um, and maybe at some point we can go through all those notes that I took, but there's one of the most important lessons that I learned about Jujitsu as a whole. I learned that during that time, and I actually, the way Hixon told it, I've translated into my own way of saying it, but believe me, it's close.

Speaker 1:          00:27:38       Like it, what it was, what it is. Is this, okay. And you've probably heard me, I teach this to this day is if, if you're playing basketball or you're playing soccer, I think soccer is what Hixon used as the example. If we're playing soccer and I w I want to or for playing football, cause you played football. If I faint to the left, right? You as a defender you have to react to me. You, you, if you don't move to the left, I'm just going to go left and you're going to be lost. So, so when I faked to the left and now you move, I can quickly adjust back because I'm one step ahead of you. It was a fake, it wasn't a full commitment. So I can get by you because, because when you put your, when you move your weight, your weight is a real thing and you have to place it into the ground.

Speaker 1:          00:28:34       And when you put your weight into the ground, it takes a quarter of a second to pull that weight back off the ground and put it in the other direction. So the difference be in Jujitsu. The guy on the bottom when you fake me, I don't have to put my weight anywhere at my, my, my, my weight does not have to follow you if you're on the bus with a guy on the bottom in Jujitsu his way, he doesn't. If you, if you shuck and Jive my weight, I don't have to play my weight. That's what, it's really hard to like faint one way and then run the other way. It doesn't really work. And you can, you do it. Yeah. But it doesn't work consistently in Jujitsu. And so that was this huge lesson to me that I've always remembered. And W and the other part of it is, was the hip movement and, and how to move your hips on the bottom.

Speaker 1:          00:29:23       And if you don't move your hips on the bottom, you're, you're going to get your guard past. And if you don't control the hips when you're passing, then you won't be able to pass the guard. So I have a real, I had a real focus for a long time of how to keep my hips mobile on the ground so that people couldn't pass my guard. And it's something that I still concentrate on interests. And when you're passing the guard, if you, and again this is another thing you might hear me tell people like, oh, you got control of my legs. Cool, you didn't control my hips and you can control my legs, you can put pin him on the ground, I can still move my hips. Eventually it'll be a little bit more tricky but I can do it. So those were those two points that I learned from Hixson.

Speaker 1:          00:30:09       I, I really focused on them for a long period of time. And so that was awesome. And then of course I rolled with fixing cars. I was friends with Fabio and Fabio told them I was going to be there and so he, you know, he was a great guy and you know, rolled with me and like I said, I was a blue belt and I was a good blue belt. Right. Meaning what are, when I rolled with, when I rolled with brown belts and black belts, which there weren't a lot of at the time, I did really good. You know what I mean? We were all competitive at, at Fabio school at that time, you know us guys that were really hardcore, cause dean at this time was, he might've been a blue belt or a purple belt, but we were the Guys Hague's was a purple belt at the time.

Speaker 1:          00:30:54       So, so we were the guys and you know when guys would come from Brazil off the competition circuit to come in and train at Fabio's when they'd stop by, you know, those guys would have a brown belts, black belts are going against dean lister and Higgs. I mean those guys were not getting, it was, you know, Dean and he eggs were awesome. Dean was phenomenal. He eggs was phenomenal and I was in the mix with those guys, you know, so we were good is what I'm saying. So what did it feel like to roll with Hixon? I thought about this and I thought about a way to describe it. And this is the way I am going to describe it. It's going to be hard to imagine, but try and imagine it. Okay. Hey, if you ever felt very quick, a large amount of very quickly rolling water or flowing water.

Speaker 1:          00:31:42       Yes. So a river, a giant hose, a pipe with water like coming out of it. And when you stick your hand, like you can't barely resist it, that much water. So imagine that feeling of force, but it's not going fast. It's going slow. It just, it don't, you can't stop it and wherever, but just like water. So it's like that much force. But just like water, wherever you go to stop it, it just goes around it. And it was that, that was what, what it was like. And I'm really, really just phenomenal Jujitsu. And I mean even at that time and remembering back to it, it was a nother level of Jujitsu for sure. That was was awesome. And now, so yeah, that's, that's wrong and fix. And I still actually, I got some mutual friends with Hickson and uh, I see him occasionally. And

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       you know, the, the, the cool thing about Hixon is he's got a personality

Speaker 3:          00:32:51       that

Speaker 2:          00:32:55       I would love to tell you that he's, you know, like a stereotypical peaceful warrior master that seems content with where he's ended up in life and with his experiences in life. But with Hixon, I get the feeling that,

Speaker 3:          00:33:17       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:33:17       he's a guy that fighting is in his blood. Right. And even though he's a mellow guy and he has nothing to prove to anybody, I think, and it, it kind of feels like the way I feel. He likes the taste of blood, you know what I mean? And even though, even though I'm kind of the same way, like I feel like, you know, I'm pretty mellow. I mean, I don't, I don't have anything, I'm not trying to prove anything to anybody. I guess maybe I am in some ways, but I'm pretty mellow. But I still, I like the taste of blood and I love that feeling of

Speaker 2:          00:34:00       combat. And that's kind of what you said. That's what I sense from Hickson and so, yeah. Awesome. And maybe we'll have him on here sometime. Hixon grace. He does have that mystique though. That's it is crazy how that is, you know, and it's because it's real. Yeah. It because it's real. You can go and like I said, Google Hixon Gracie stories or Hixon Gracie black belt stories. There's stories where he would line up 10 black belts and say, I'm going to submit you all have with an arm lock on your right arm. And he would do it and he would do it. And that's, and so the, yeah, that build you some mystique for sure. Yup. Yes. I, one time I went, I was going to film with him, just like a quick video clip with me and Halleck flew into crones academy Kron Gracie Academy. And so I get there and he's there already, you know, and he had, so guys were leaving, they were done training, guys were leaving and Hallux like, Hey, I'm going to be like 45 minutes to an hour late.

Speaker 2:          00:35:08       So it's just me and Nick's in there and the whole like, everyone's gone. So he's like, yeah, I was like, oh yeah, no, I was there to film. I would have been, hey, you got your geezer? He had his pants on. Oh, scared. I submitted to the mystique. But no, we're uh, you know, we were waiting for a helicase. Oh Yeah, how lucky me later, whatever. He was like, yeah, yeah, I know. He, he told me or whatever. So he's like, he's kind of just there looking at me. So we just sit down. I got to talk to Hexion for like 15 minutes, just about whatever, you know. And he's kind of looking at me like as if to say like, so what, uh, you know, who are you and what do we do? All cool. But he was still Hicks and Gracie, so my mind kept while we were talking, my mind kept going into like jumping outside of my brain and thinking I could look what you're doing right now you're sitting with Hixon.

Speaker 2:          00:35:58       You know how like after we roll and we don't have anywhere to be, we'll be just talking about stuff. He's sitting there. Most people. That's how, and I was doing that with Hixon Gracie, that just me and him Bro. That's crazy. Right? I mean, you know, as a, as someone who knew, I know who that is from the beginning, even before I even started. You did sue. I know who that is. Yeah. So yeah, man. I was like, how I was funny too, his bed that night, back in the day he brought, he brought his sons with him as well. Hawkson was there and chrome was there. Corn was a little kid, man, tiny kid. And Fabio told him that I was in the seal teams and stuff and that's, you know, so he told me he had a little conversation. That's another funny thing. He said, so when are we got done rolling?

Speaker 2:          00:36:39       And we were talking like yours are saying, and he says to me, he goes, you know, so hey, they don't affect your role whenever he goes. Yeah. He said, uh, you're, you're, you're very comfortable in bad positions. Right. Right off. I'll take it, I'll take it. It's, I do this too. Sometimes when people used to ask me, hey, what was it like rolling with x? And I'd say, okay, let me get your guard. And then I'd get in their garden. They'd say, okay now and then I'd say, okay now just relax and let me pass and then I would just pass their garden mountain. I said that's what it feels like. That excellent, very comfortable in bed. That's kind of like after you like box a guy and you say, hey, you can take punches. Right. Good. Basically your face is tough and that's another fear.

Speaker 2:          00:37:28       I mean I kind of held onto that like I always like to be comfortable in bad positions. Dean, it's really good because when I turned with dean all the time and so you know, there's no one that that I roll with on a regular basis at a roll with some really good guys. But when Dean is mounted on you or when Dean is on side control on you, it is insufferable, bad position. And especially because like I'll roll with I role with other really high level guys that aren't from our school. And when I roll with them, if they get a position like that, they don't know exactly my every little escape. Dean knows exactly. He knows, he knows all 14 of my escapes. He knows them all. So you're more trapped on more trout. And it's the same with him. When I get to position I know what he's going to do.

Speaker 2:          00:38:18       I know. And so he and I joke about it, you know, eat, neither one of us want the other person to be, especially across side, you know, and we don't want that. So I guess that's an accident. Acid in boxing too, if you can take punches. Oh for sure. He's comfortable in bad positions in Jujitsu. Is is Kinda like back when you were talking about the, when you're in water and things are going bad, dark panic. If you're comfortable in bad positions, like you have the ability to yeah, to not panic. And that helps so much because when you panic you gas,

Speaker 1:          00:38:51       Hey, do you make stupid mistakes and Jujitsu, you make stupid mistakes, so yeah, man, I'm just going to push this leg out of here. Oh, now he's grabbing my arm.

Speaker 2:          00:38:58       Yeah. Yeah. He wanted you to do that. That's good compliment. Next question. In podcasts, 50 for the Armed Forces officer, remember that book? Their Armed Forces officer? Yeah. One of my feet. 1950 edition. Yeah. Can you expound on the difference between these two? These two seemingly contradictory quotes from the manual, affirm hold at the beginning pays 10 fold dividend of the timid approach followed by a show of firmness later on from general Malone story of a World War One

Speaker 1:          00:39:33       compared with and General Malone's. If you remember the story was there's mad messed up unit and he went in there. It was like, all right, get squared away. Get these boards in place, get out of the mud. What you need to get your uniforms together. Just tighten them up out of the gate like firmness right from this way out of the gate and then compare it

Speaker 2:          00:39:50       two. Okay. Here's the quote. It's a mistake for an officer on taking a new post to order sweeping changes affecting the other man in the belief that this will give him a reputation for action and firmness. The studying of situations is the overture of the steadying of it, and that's from general

Speaker 1:          00:40:09       in general. We're May, if you remember that one, he said, hey, none of you guys would be in these positions unless you were doing things right. So I assume that you're doing a good job and we're going to continue what you're doing. That's what he said when he took over. So what's going on here is you've got two completely different situations and the two situations are, one is a guy taking over first situation, a known bad situation. The troops are lacking discipline. They're not executing the mission. If you remember for that story, they weren't even doing basic military bearing. They didn't, they weren't saluting the officers. They just hadn't thrown everything out the window. That's a situation where you got to come in, you got to get from out of the gate. That's what you gotta do. Now they got to know that. They got to know that things are gonna Change.

Speaker 1:          00:40:51       They got to know it's real. They got to know there's a new plan and I got to know what that new plan is and then they got to know that there's new standards and they got to know what the new standards are. Boom. And it's the same thing. You know, Hackworth. He did that. He came in with some, you know, if you remember when he took over the, the hardcore battalion, what became the hardcore battalion, the first thing he did was like all those radios and guitars and all this crap that you have sitting around base. Put it all in the middle of the base tomorrow and we're getting rid of it all. That was a big change. Now Hackworth. Then he, then he started implementing two changes a day. If you remember, hey gotta get everyone can carry your weapon at all times. That's the neck change.

Speaker 1:          00:41:31       Okay, get your helmet. Now we've got to get helmet covers. When he just made one, one or two small changes a day after he made some big sweeping changes out of the gate because it was a jacked up battalion and now, now the differences, if you're going into a situation where everything's going fine or okay or at a bare minimum it's like normal, well then you don't need to step in there and show that you're have a manned by making these sweeping changes. You don't need to do that. It comes across, it comes across like the people that you just took charge of have no idea what they're doing and get you don't, you don't respect what they did, what they, what their methodology. You don't respect their, their performance because you're coming in and saying, oh, echo, by the way, the way you report cord, the podcast, you need to get rid of those microphones. You need to edit it tighter your basis to, you know, what would you be thinking if I came in and said that?

Speaker 2:          00:42:23       Well, you know

Speaker 1:          00:42:25       me a little bit different, but you know, I understand your pain point being. If somebody comes in and starts criticizing you right when you do it. Okay. When you're doing a good job, we know you're doing a good job. Yeah, I think you're doing a good job. There's something that I get on you about that base. Occasionally that's your, that's really on you. You know you're blocking your base. But yeah, so that's the thing. If that's the decision you gotta make, and guess what? It's not black and white. You don't go into some units. It's not like you're going to get a choice between a unit that's doing horrible and a unit that's doing great. You're going to get every thing in between and therefore you have to modulate your leadership to reflect. If it's a, if it's a group that might have a tendency of being a little bit jacked up and they're getting close, guess what?

Speaker 1:          00:43:12       Gotta gotta gotta beat. Maybe not sweeping changes, but you might need to make a little statement, right? If it's a group that's performing awesome, fantastic top, top team, top, whatever, you might need to come and say, hey guys, I see that you're doing great. I'm here to just keep you guys doing what you're doing. Let me know what you need to support. Boom. And it could be anywhere in between that spectrum. That's why leadership is challenging, cause you gotta be able to got to have nuance. You gotta be able to modulate. Yeah. You gotta figure out where that is and you've got to test it out to, once you give that sweeping order, you've got to see what kind of reaction.

Speaker 2:          00:43:47       Gotcha.

Speaker 1:          00:43:49       You know, you've got to see two people just instantly rebel. Okay. Then let's talk this. Let's get some feedback. What's going on? Clearly we have a disrespect scenario going on. When you get to bottom of this, let me get some key leaders in here. Let me talk to them, get some feedback, which you should do that before you make any sweeping changes anyway. He got to at least talk to the key leadership. Get them in the game. Get them on board. Yeah. That's why leadership is awesome. That's why I beat, that's why this stuff is so fun because it's challenging. It's different every single time it feels like, um, kinda like what we were talking about earlier where if you start to understand the formula, all the different details that come out and you can kind of apply the formula in one way and even then still dynamic, but, but you can, you can just get a better grass. Just like Jujitsu.

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       If you understand the concept that you have to be able to move your hips, there's a bunch of different ways you can get your hips moving, right? If you understand the concept that you need to mobilize the hips to pass the guard, if you understand that concept, there's all kinds of different ways you can do it. If you understand the concept of totally jacked up team is going to need a sweeping change to get their attention and get them to understand that things are gonna change and what they were doing was unacceptable. If you understand that concept, that that's what it's going to take, you can apply it all the way through those gradiations all the way down to, hey, this team is doing great and I don't need to change much. I just need to give them the support that they need. Conceptual instruction, very important.

Speaker 2:          00:45:12       That's what Jocko, I recently listened to the strategic con podcast while on my way to coach Lacrosse and I was impressed how many of the points made between both Maurice and your experience as an operator translated into the field. Another point of the cast that stuck out and now I reflect on as learning experience and coachable moment for myself was the saying of good work. When we recently battled through uh, uh, the first half we game lacrosse game, it was a grudge match in this one he's talking, I edited a little bit out of this because he had a really long email and we believe in brevity around here. So he's actually now talking about a soccer match grudge match, set their plan. Okay. So boom, they had a hard first half. It was a grudge match. Uh, I'm very evenly played until, until the half when I told the boys they were doing good work out there and that we were matching their intensity and putting pressure on them.

Speaker 2:          00:46:07       Then the first 30 seconds of the second half we were scored on due to lack of intensity and follow through. I suspect it may have been from my good job, quote unquote good work. Keep it up talk we had in the inn at the halftime. My question to you is how does one reinforce the fact they were hitting hard up there? Give them some words of encouragement and send them back out without taking a hit in intensity as the coach of freshmen high school boys who are basically wild dogs and need direction plus support, what could I have done different to keep the intensity up in the second half and even after getting scored on? So this is, this is pretty simple and I've actually talked about this before. Um, I've talked about it with regards to MMA and I've talked about it with regards to my seal platoon, my seal task unit.

Speaker 2:          00:46:58       And that is that you have to be very careful with praise. Oh yeah, yeah. Because in the example that I give in the corner of MMA fights is if you tell the guy, hey, good job. You know you're, well, you won that last round. Keep just keep doing what you're doing. He's going to back off. Yeah, he's going to back off. And guess what the other corners telling him, you lost that round. You need to step it up. You need to get aggressive. And that's what they're going to do. They're going to get out there because I'll tell you, most people in an MMA fight, MMA fight is a, it's like

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       wrestling. It's a very intense cardio activity. You're good. Everybody's going to be tired, beat just about everybody. I mean obviously. So when you get two guys will, let me, let me rephrase that. When you get two guys that are evenly matched and are going at it hard, they're both going to be tired and so they're going to want a little bit of arrest. So if you give them that opportunity to back off the throttle just a little bit, subconsciously they're going to do it because they think they're doing good. They think that one that last round, so you can see that all the time. You see, I mean, it happened, it happened with Rhonda. You know, they're saying, hey, good job, good job. You're looking good. And she's getting crushed. I mean, that's kind of a bad example. But anyways, you gotta be careful that in, in, I've told this story before, but when my tasking was going through training and uh, we will doing CQC, so close quarters, combat drills, we're going in to kill house over and over and you know, we broke for lunch or something.

Speaker 1:          00:48:28       We come back from lunch and the guy that is the Kadri, they're like, hey, you guys are kicking ass. This is great. Keep it up. You guys are two best task. You know, we've seen out of here. You guys are crushing it. And literally the next run guys go in the house, they screw everything up, they miss targets, just a disaster. And I talked to the contrary. I'm like, don't ever tell my guys again that they're the best guys in the world. Don't ask, don't tell them that you can tell him good job, but don't be telling them they're the best people in the world. Just doesn't work. And so that's kind of what happened. You know here. Now the thing is, this doesn't mean that you can never give anybody credit or never give anyone praise because you absolutely have to do that. But what you have to do, you have to proactively counteract the mental lapse in intensity that's about to take place because you just compliment them.

Speaker 1:          00:49:17       So how do you do that? So let's say you're on the lacrosse field or the soccer field, you bring the boys in. You say, look guys, good half good. First half of you took it to them. You showed them that we can hang with them. You played him even. That's fine. Here's a problem. Even isn't good enough. We need to get out there and play harder. We need to step it up. I actually want you guys to play like murderers. That's what I want you to do. I want you to win every loose ball. I want you to make every tackle. I want you to get your head on every ball that's in the air. You stick to them on defense. I don't even want them to be able to breathe. I want you to work them into the ground. I want pressure, pressure, upfront, pressure in the midfield and pressure on d you make them fight for every inch, every ball, and every breath. I want you to go out there and take their souls.

Speaker 1:          00:50:20       So you got to counter that. You know, you got to counter the good job thing. So in MMA it's the same thing. You know, hey, good round. Who was a close but a good round. But listen, you can't let up right now. You need to step it up. He knows he has to step it up. I'm telling you, he knows he's got to step it up. And if you come out week, he's going to get the upper hand right away. You need to put him away. You need to go out there and crush him, crush his soul, turn it on and put this guy away. I want you to kill him. So that's what you need to do with that. Now for tactical training. Same thing. Cause you know, I know this police officer's and Swat teams and t and guys that are in the military, you're doing tactical training all the time and you're going to see that as the team comes together, they're going to start to do good.

Speaker 1:          00:51:08       But like I said, if you give them too much, they're going to slack, right? So you know when you're running your tactical training, you for your guys, you say, look, hey guys, I see some good progress out there. We're making some good runs. But let me tell you it's not good enough for it right now. Okay, this is the deal. The enemy can rely on luck. We can't, we rely on our training. We trained to be prepared for anything that the enemy throws at us. So we're going to work as hard as we can and be as perfect as we can. So we are ready for the worst case scenario. So get jacked up for another run right now. And I want you to go in there like a band of bloodthirsty viking shock troops on our damn berserker rage and crush this. So you want to bring that kind of counts right? And then in combat again, and I just was talking to some guys yesterday and it's the same thing where complacency is the worst thing that can happen with your team when you're in a combat scenario. So what were your combat? You know, it's look, hey guys, we're running some good operations, right? We got the upper hand and that's good,

Speaker 1:          00:52:28       but it's not good enough. We cannot be complacent and we can't take our foot off the enemy's throat. We are going to be relentless. We are not going to give him the chance to regroup. He will not get the chance to recover. There will be no downtime for the enemy. And I'll tell you what, I don't even want the enemy to have a chance to bury their dead. We are not going to stop until there is nothing left to pursue and no one left to bury. So sharpen up your knives, load up your magazines, because we got work to do. So again, we got to counter, you know, the compliments and balance. Essentially what I'm doing in each one of those situations, I'm balancing the positive affirmations of what is happening with some new goals and new objectives that will ensure that there will be no slack.

Speaker 3:          00:53:30       Yeah, so the guy said

Speaker 1:          00:53:37       they were ninth graders. Freshman. Yeah, freshman wild dogs. Yup.

Speaker 3:          00:53:43       Yeah. Next question.

Speaker 1:          00:53:47       How do you detach without seeming completely cold?

Speaker 3:          00:53:53       Okay, important question.

Speaker 1:          00:53:56       No, I'm saying this all time. You know, you got to detach. I also say all the time, if you detach from all your emotions, that means your robot and people don't fall robots. I say it all the time. So when you do detach,

Speaker 3:          00:54:09       you can't,

Speaker 1:          00:54:11       you can't completely step away. But if you do,

Speaker 3:          00:54:16       you have to. You have to act. You have to do a little acting. Now, first of all,

Speaker 1:          00:54:26       we already talked about this, right? We already talked about these red flags, that

Speaker 3:          00:54:29       debt

Speaker 1:          00:54:31       show that you're going to lose your temper, that you're going to get emotional about something. You know, you're clenched fist and you're raised voice and your heavy breathing and your flared nostrils and all that stuff, right? So you know what those things mean. Those things mean those things are your, your signal that mean detach. Okay, so you got to work on that. Now here's the dichotomy of it is once you are there and once you have detached, you actually have to now go back

Speaker 3:          00:55:00       and do

Speaker 1:          00:55:03       one or some of those things that you are trying not to do. You have to go and you have to do them a little bit in a nice little controlled manner, right? Maybe raise your voice a little bit.

Speaker 3:          00:55:15       Hm.

Speaker 1:          00:55:17       Maybe you just kind of clench your jaw on and you remember I said to you like, like nodding your head in a positive way. And that's when you, if you're coming to me with an issue and I nod my head to the affirmative, you know, up and down saying, yes, I understand. Yes, I understand that's a soothing thing to your team, right? They see that you're, you're okay with it. The opposite of that is when you shake your head in the negative. Like if you're telling me some problem and I'm shaking my head, it's like Amigo and Tim, I can't believe this is going on. Right. So yeah. So maybe that's another thing that you, you, you clench your jaw and you shake your head. Did you show the person like, look, I know we're in a bad way. I get it. I'm not sitting back here like it's no big deal.

Speaker 1:          00:55:54       I know it's gonna be a tough, I know we just lost a sale or I know we just, you know, I'm going to have to plan another mission that we just got back. I understand that it's hard. You care. I care. You know I'm with you. You want to give that, maybe you let out that little sigh of frustration, you know, like a little, like something like that, right? Just going to do that little thing. You just do that just so showing that you do got some emotions and you are invested in all that stuff. And, and then once, once you see that you've achieved your goal here, that you can see that, that they see that you have some emotions on the situation, then you, you quickly get yourself to recover from that. You get yourself composed and you've shown them and they, and they've seen that it's almost like a little to see like a little weakness and they go, okay, you don't, Tacos are human related.

Speaker 1:          00:56:50       Yeah, I can relate, but he's mad. But you know what? I actually want him to calm down. I actually am glad he's so good. Yardi, I'm using two. What? I'm glad he's calming down. That's good. Okay, so the new recover and you go back to your calm, cool. Collected self, right. That's what we're going to do now. Like I said, this is, do we call this acting? I guess maybe we could call it acne, but at the same time acting means you're trying to pretend to be somebody. You're not trying to pretend to be anybody else. You're being you. That's all you're doing. You're being you. You're just acting like yourself. Just showing a little bit more of the emotion. And then you would be if you were just completely detached. So it's not like you're trying to act like some, you know, junior. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:57:38       You're not trying to, to, to play a role of someone else or just being you. So, and you already know what you do because you've learned how, what the signals are. So when you know that you raise your voice and that means you're okay, then you just raise your voice a little bit. If you know that you, you just give a little sites. It's those careful things. And so, yeah, I guess it is acting in a way, but it's not full on anybody can do it, I think. Yeah. Yeah, you did. I think that's great. This is my opinion. You do it with your kids, you know? Oh, I mean, I'm like, you got to pretend to act gay. You know, you're mad or, or whatever. Any good. Even happy, even pretend to act happy. I needed excellent. Okay. We'll say excited. Hey, I got something for you. It's a drawing of a happy face. Same as she did yesterday. You know? And it's like, I'm not the honest truth is I'm excited about other things. We'll just say that bro.

Speaker 2:          00:58:39       I'm all those loved all that love you got for crying about that letter. You're going to, you're going to know it's all going backwards now. People are going to hate you. Now rob talking about exciting your daughter Josie, a beautiful picture and you don't care about it. It was cold blooded. What I'm going to give her is a lot of excitement. I'm going to match her excitement. Maybe even go one level higher. That's what I'm going to give her. So what am

Speaker 1:          00:59:05       I'm excited about? A lot of other things a little bit though, right? It's the same. Same thing. Uh, that was messed up by the way. Same thing. Yeah, it's, is it a form of manipulation? It might be a little bit of a form of manipulation, but again, if you're doing it to the individual and you're doing it to help the team, then isn't manipulation or is it leadership? I say, of course, if leadership you're not manip manipulation is, I'm trying to fool you so you do things that I want you to do that we're not doing that. It's not what we're running here.

Speaker 1:          00:59:38       All right, next question. Next question. Please discuss how disciplined in one area doesn't make up for slack in other areas. For example, the fit is guru who has no savings. Mm. Yeah. You know, this is something that we all have to work out for watch out for is the fact that we, we focus on our strengths, right? That's what we do. That's what people do. So you get a person that's smart, you know, really intellectual person and they let themselves go physically, right? Right. You know, or you get a person that's a physical stud, but then they're not going to challenge their brain power. Or like the question that was, you know, the example here that was posed, you know, someone that's a fitness guru or a party, Google who, I'm throwing that one out there because some people really go to that or they, you know, they're an entrepreneur.

Speaker 1:          01:00:34       I'm an entrepreneur and so they're driving a new Mercedes, but it's leased and they're behind on payments. So strategically yet. Yeah. Yeah. That, um, so you, you know, I mean you take another example is what about the business person that doesn't have time for their family, right? Yeah. And so that's not good. So I think the focus here is your, we try and we all have to be, try to be well rounded and not focus so much on one area that you're going to let some of that area go. That's target fixation is what that is, right? Is you walk into a room and you get fixated on one target, one bad guy, you think there's one bad guy. So you focus all your energy and then you're getting fined. That's target fixation. You can't let that happen. You can't let it happen on the battlefield.

Speaker 1:          01:01:21       You can't let it happen and the life. So look out for that when you do this. Um, and I'll tell you, this is actually a reality of the situation. Um, I try and maintain this balance, but I've been actually working a lot lately. And what, and this is a clear indicator to me that I've overbooked myself is last week we had this eye, we had to skip a day of Jujitsu to record. I mean we don't do that right? When did we record rear corner after Jujitsu. But I knew I had so much stuff going on that I said, hey we gotta we gotta record at this time because I got to get this other stuff done because I'm traveling and this and that. And so we had to skip those huge, it's cut. So that is a red flag to me that says I need to, I need to tighten up, I need to get my, you know, get my schedule back in check so that I can do the, that I need to do.

Speaker 1:          01:02:21       Of course. What do I say about the situation? It's fine. You know what? Can't train Jiu Jitsu that day cause I'm trying, I got some travel coming up. Good. I'm going to heal up my shoulder a little bit more. I'm going to, as you know, I'm going to, it's, it's good, it's fine, but it is an indicator of when things start going in the wrong direction. Maybe I'm getting target fixated on you know, too much work at a certain time, which to me again, I will run this thing in the red as you say. I like, I like running in the red, right? I'm in the red and I got no problem. Like we will go hard in the numbers of hours I've been where I will work. We'll have actually no impact on how much I'm going to tell them to spend with my family and do Jujitsu and all that stuff cause I'll just do it all.

Speaker 1:          01:03:08       But there is a capacity that you reach where you go, okay now one of these things that has just started to slide, now I need to make sure that my levels get re re levels, I guess you might say equalized is what I should have said. Uh, so back to the subject. Don't be a one trick pony, you know, be a jack of all trades and then master a few of those traits. And so you can emphasize fitness guru, you can emphasize intellectual power, you can emphasize Jujitsu, but don't put 100% of your effort into one area because eventually it will take you, you won't have anything else. And by the way, if you put all your, you know, if you put all your, all your eggs in the basket of intellectual power, now you're unhealthy and you die, right? That, that doesn't, you know, I don't care how smart you are, you can't do two plus two when you're dead. So don't put all your focus 100% into one area. Don't become unbalanced in your disciplines is spread it around and hold the line. Yeah man.

Speaker 2:          01:04:23       Good. Yeah. Again, it kind of feels like,

Speaker 1:          01:04:29       like he can be understood that, um, say I'm real good at, I dunno, fitness [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:04:40       and it's easy to justify yourself. You know, like your, your, let's say, okay, I'm real good at fitness, fitness guru. And I go around and then I see, I don't know, I go to the store or go to some party and I see this other guy who's like socially, he's just hundred percent everyone likes, he's such a nice careers. Madec I makes a lot of money in all this stuff, but he's not in that good a shape for, I don't know. He smokes and whatever, you know, it's ease. I think a lot of people,

Speaker 1:          01:05:08       whoa,

Speaker 2:          01:05:10       it feels like it's easy to justify wolf that guys in bad shape. So who cares? I really didn't want any of that. I wouldn't want all the money. You know, all this stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       It seems like you had to justify and he north the other guy saying, yeah, you might be in good shape. Guessing what? They're nice Toyota Corolla. You're driving these all negative on him. Yeah. Yeah. So both those guys should, it should, instead of saying, Hey, you know what? They should do, walk up and be like, hey man, you know what I noticed were pretty successful financially. I would like to get in the game with you a little bit and, and learn from you about that. And the other guy should say to him, well, you know what? It looks like you're in pretty good fitness levels. I would like to get in the game with that. Let's work together and improve ourselves and go out and kick ass and dominate. Are you in? I'm in. Let's do this instead. What does a normal person do? They do exactly what you said.

Speaker 1:          01:06:02       Justify, criticize, cut people down instead of building them up. Yeah. And what you have to be careful of, if I was to go to you and say, hey, you know, echo, I got a lot of money. I can tell you don't have a lot. I'll help you out. That's, that can be offensive to some people because you think, do you think you are? Yeah. You can sit back and read your hell. I'm going to worry about money. I think I'm worried about money. When I got abs like, Yo, so what we have to do is instead of, if I came to you and said, echo dude, I want abs like you got, can you help me get in the game? And then we formed a little relationship and now I say to you, man, so what do you got? What's your, what's your main income stream dude?

Speaker 1:          01:06:44       You know, what are you doing? And you say, well, you know, I've got these two clients. If you've got a website, no, not really. Why don't you have a website? Do you got any social media to advertise on? You know, when we go though that road and we build up, we take care of each other. So we don't want to do as people kind of like you ever seen the guys who go, they see like a football player or something. It'd be like, I can kick his ass though. You know, you know that Kenga got who can always like some success. He kick his ass though. Yeah. Well I've told the story in the seal teams, it's uh, no one, no one is good. If, if a guy, like we have guys in the seal teams that are literally, you know, world class athletes in whatever world, class triathlete, world class, sailor worldclass, whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:07:34       And so, oh you, oh, you're, you're world class triathlete. Oh yeah. That guy's really good triathlete. That's cool. He's a really bad shot. Someone who's going to chime in and cut them down and just the way it goes. No slack, no slack. Slack. Right. We'll go one more I think so, uh, Jocko, would you confront an individual team member when reported by other team members that they're talking smack about you? Or would you just ignore the old classic here? What do you do about the, about the negative guy that's trying to bring you and sure you can, you can confront them right? And you can, by doing that, join in there in their little game in, in doing that, you give them the satisfaction. They now know that they, they got into your head and then you're turning your workplace into, you know, your basic grade school gossip, Paul.

Speaker 1:          01:08:48       So we don't like that. But now there are times, unfortunately that's you. You have to address things and when you do it, you do it professionally and you do it. Your goal is to disarm them because remember that this negative person inside, they probably want the confrontation. That's what they want. And so you know, you say something like, Hey, I heard you had some critique points for me about how I'm doing my job. You know, if if I'd love to get your feedback so I can tighten up my game. She just disarm him a little bit and something like that. We'll likely diffuse the scenario a little bit and you know, hopefully the people under the, the, the person will understand that there are other people that are telling you what's going on. It'll kind of put them in check and stifle the situation. But deep preferred methodology for this situation for me is quite simple and that is ignore an outperform them. You see, while you're over there watching me and talking about me, I'm working, I'm working hard, I'm taking things to the next level. You Keep Gossiping and out, keep working. You keep talking smack and I'll keep working. You keep focusing on everything. And everyone else and I'll keep working. And when you finally look around at where you are and where I'm at,

Speaker 1:          01:10:38       you'll realize that you have nothing left to talk smack about.

Speaker 3:          01:10:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:10:47       Eight you will lose an eye will whip. And this key or applies to when people are playing office politics or forming their little cliques or working their personal agendas. And again, I know sometimes you have to play those games. Yeah. But

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       let your first course of action lift the fundamental core of your reaction be to outwork and out perform every last one of them.

Speaker 2:          01:11:40       And I think that's all I've got for tonight. So Echo Charles. Yes. Speaking of work, do work. Why don't you just go ahead and put in some work right now and let him, everybody know how they can support this podcast if they want to. They want to actually, you know what I'm talking about? I'm talking about the work I did today. Hm. Make [inaudible] 15 all that. Anyway, um, anyway, we'll talk about on it. You want to support this podcast, support yourself on it. What's the of the Krill oil? It's real. It's real. And I thought about this, like I'm kind of lifting kind of hard and like I do, um, like squats right to the very like different kinds and different weights. And do you do overhead squats? Sometimes you do at overhead squat? Not a lot. I would call it a lot, but just one that that is like one that you can do it all, like front squats or something like that. But I go all the way down all the way down the caters to squat. Yeah. Well some, sometimes you know, people don't have the flexibility in their feet or their ankles or whatever or you know, you're lifting like 500 pounds or something going all the way anyway. My point is it can be hard on your knees.

Speaker 2:          01:13:01       It can't straight up those, those are the facts. It can be anyway. And I'm kind of going and cut hard nowadays, like pretty much everyday lift and Jujitsu, you know, like harder than I have in the past for sure. And I don't have the, anyway, the crude, the point is the Krill oil, Krill oil is real. Well, I don't have any, any pain. No pain, no pain, no pain. Still going. She's still like three a day. Three in the morning and three at night. Just three days. Three a day. I do twice as much as you. Well, you're bigger and older. Do you mean bigger and bigger? Factually older. Oh yeah. Yeah, and I was thinking zero before. Keep that in mind too, but yeah, man, it's good. Krill oil. That's the, what's funny is when you think supplements, that's you think like somebody that's going to make me stronger, you know, if I take it versus don't take it.

Speaker 2:          01:13:57       Well, I guess cruel. It does make you stronger, but it's like indirect out more. Yeah. You know, I've been taking krill oil for so long. I don't even know what it's like to not take krill oil anymore. Things just one big mystery. No one big path to victory when you, when to take the Krill oil on it. Ecologically friendly harvesting of Krill. Watched the video on a.com [inaudible] dot com slash chocolate if you want 10% off a pre workout, which is total strength and performance, he'll give you more strength and more performance. My anecdotal shroom tech proof, by the way I, I got on, I had a bunch of, like I said, I've been working a lot, I've been traveling a lot. When you're traveling, you're getting on planes with a bunch of people that you don't know and they have all kinds of germs as do I.

Speaker 2:          01:14:49       And so people get sick and I can't be sick and do my job because I've got to go talk to people and meet people and it gives speeches and all that stuff so I can't be getting sick. So I knew I had critical events coming up. So guess what? I did shroom tech immune. Oh I did this room tech immune. Okay. Powered through. You're not sick now. No, I'm not sick now. Nope. Training hard surf today. So it'd basically and worked out and got after it. So Dang immune to the sickness. So Dang, there's another one in the rotation. Is that what we're saying and, and yeah, I cycled it. Yeah. I just cycled it because I knew I didn't want to get sick. And I suppose you could just say, hey, have, when do you want to get sick? Right. We never, yeah. Maybe it's something I should take more often.

Speaker 2:          01:15:39       Yeah. It's, well, and it's one of the things kind of like, um, like a backend computer programmer where you don't really, you're not hit by the success of it. You're only hit by the failure of it, you know, so immune, certain tech immune, you take it, you don't get sick, you're like, oh, I ain't, you know, it's cool, you know? But yeah, no, I, like I said, a bunch of events back to the Ted talk and so what am I going to show up to the Ted talk? Coughing. Can't take that chance. Yeah. Yeah. I can't take the chance getting happen. Stuffy nose. You know what, what are you gonna do? No, you can't do those things. You've got to show up and have your a game. Yeah. You know, shroom tech immune. Yeah. And these are good because these aren't like, um, you know how, okay, so cruel.

Speaker 2:          01:16:21       Let's go krill oil where that works. Your joints. But it's not like, it's like a cortisone shot where, you know, you just don't feel it when you get off it, you're jacked, you know, you're, you're back to zero. It's like this is stuff that like helps your body do it, you know, that's the good part. It's not, it's not a foreign, horrible substance that you're going to become reliant dependent. Yeah man. It's still good. Um, and what, okay. Yeah. They're all good. All of them. And there's other stuff. There's cool stuff to the almond. It's like a three nut butter blend good to him and tried to gourmet. It's good, bad. It's too bad. That's on you bro. Good. And um, yeah, there's a lot of stuff on there. It's protein powder and obviously quality protein powder if you, if you're into protein powder, um, shroom tech for that.

Speaker 2:          01:17:09       The preworkout, that's the one, bro. If you're, if you're lifting and doing hard workouts, get to get the preworkout cause he's not stimulants, not like, you know, so. So I don't, cause I work out early in the morning as we know and I don't like working out on an empty stomach on a full stomach. So I work out on an empty stomach in the morning. Good idea. But I, and you told me that you might consider this cheating because I will take it pre's usually it's, yeah. Yeah. Yo, look at you like I'm cheating. Look at this guy, that button. It's not cheating at all. But then he also on top of that, I don't do it the, I'll do it. If every heavy hitter is coming to train, I'll, I'll, I'll do it. It's a advantage. I remember us rolling with, I was on a 72 hour fast and I was like almost at the end of it and I did everything normal.

Speaker 2:          01:18:03       I didn't, it didn't change anything. I squatted, I didn't pull ups, said everything normal workout, surf. Did you get to I was at the end of it and I was rolling the big Eric. Um, you know, judo, Eric and I said, I'm going to tell you something when we get done. So we rolled hard and it was no, it was just putting the way we normally roll, you know, and got after it hard. And I said, and he said, what were you going to tell me? I said, yeah, I'm on a, I'm on the tail end of a 72 hour fast right now. And he's like, well it didn't seem to affect your performance. And I said, no, I don't think it affects your performance at all. Just straight up to somebody. And it got him a fuck. I forget who it was. It was a while ago, but, and then I got them and you could tell he was pissed.

Speaker 2:          01:18:41       Who the hell is that? They anyway, he said, oh one of the first thing that you said. Oh I'm fasting right now. Yeah, I forget who it is. That is actually why I didn't tell Eric. Right. Cause then it's just an excuse. [inaudible] also and also psychological warfare. If I tell them, hey, I'm fascinated, I'm in a fasted state, he might get all, I get empowered, you know, I'm not going to let that happen. Uh, Jujitsu is, there's a, mine is on my knees to do two going on. Even before you wrote, when you clap the hands, give it that little bump. That was an aggressive pump. Remember that time or right after we rolled and you said, hey, you know, did you feel that? I was like kind of getting tired towards the end there and I said, no. You're like, yeah cause it wasn't.

Speaker 2:          01:19:27       I feel proud you are of that right now. That's like your, your best line to me. Although that was a good one. Good one. It was pretty good. It's, it's, it's hard. It's hard to get me tired at Jujitsu. Yeah. You know what it usually, it's not all conditioning too. I just, I know how to conserve some energy. Yeah, but he probably, you know her. You know what? This is what, what part of it is, if not a major part, you can endure fatigue and tiredness if you're enjoying what you're doing. That's why for a lot of people that treadmill, he's just hell. Even though the treadmill is not that hard, it's like you're going at like a certain, like a low percentage of output. It's just so boring. There's no like payoff in Jujitsu. It's like its payoff upon payoff upon payoff. You pass someone's guard.

Speaker 2:          01:20:14       Oh my gosh, they pass your guard, your look what I've got a wage, my thing, you know it's like this, this intricate battle. Meanwhile you're getting super tired. I you get tired. No, no, I had to, well me, I'm in great shape and all that stuff. You have made some incredible strides though on two areas. You used to gas out really, really bad until, until you started doing metcons and your training in your, in your non Judycki training used to gas out really bad yet, number one. Number two you used to get really cost are phobic and not be able to handle that. Yeah, and they were, they got to play on the play off each other. I cured. You have both those. Once I realized you were claustrophobic for awhile, you're like test time. How do you like this? Yeah. And what's crazy is there's a third element there is because if you know you gas quick and then you get claustrophobic.

Speaker 2:          01:21:08       Now that's another enemy, the gassing and the Claustrophobia, that's another enemy. So I'm not just going to you and you're doing it to me. I'm going to get gas gassing customer. So that makes me even more like anxiety and like you said, they're compounding problems because the more tired you get, the worst position you get into. Now you're getting claustrophobic. Panic can be more tired. Yeah. And then let that happen one day, the next day. What am, what am I scared of now? It's the swamps of sadness, Bro. All over again. Well you dug your way out of that pretty good. I think the metcon had a lot to do with it. You know, you just, what did you just mentally eventually say like, okay when Jocko gets side control on me and holds me there, I just need to relax and just sit there and accept that I'm going to be here for a little while.

Speaker 2:          01:21:48       Yeah. And a big part of it cause sometimes it start to get dizzy, like for real coffee. It's not just the feeling of, oh I'm just so claustrophobic. And that's it. I think it was like a for real classic cause you start to get dizzy and you know, like you're not like you're about to faint but, but something like that, you know, it was that, it was a good addition. What am I, you know, I used to get the guys and train with them all like in a row and I do like 15 minutes with this guy and then 15 minutes of this guy and then 15 good go through the platoons. And um, and there's one guy and he was super claustrophobic and he would get so mad, he'd be, you know, I'd hold him, you know, I'd get across cider and get them out and just not let him move from my chest over his face.

Speaker 2:          01:22:35       And he would just, you know, and he would lose it, you know, and, and you don't take, he'd be tapping me like crazy. I'm like, there's no submission. What do you don't do that for me? You can't tap when there's no submission. We got me and then, you know, finally I'd tap them out and then let them go and he'd be like, he'd be like, God, you Kinda just stay off. Meaning get so mad and just to kind of stop training. I mean if you have like a dean did that to me w back, back in the, when I had, he was like mounted, then I'd be like, and then I tap. Oh Man. That's like man dean. Actually it was funny yesterday. Maybe the day. Yeah, it was yesterday. The did you do the power was going out like momentarily in the gym a few times.

Speaker 2:          01:23:18       Yeah. Well before the power started, like it was going off for 10 seconds. Certain lights though. Yeah, but so it was killing the clock. Yes. So we were going when the clock was still running and he was doing that to me. Right. And when he tries to make me claustrophobic or tries to get reaction out of me, I just go into like complete detachment, mental shutdown. Not, not mental shutdown in a negative way, but mental shutdown. Like, okay, I'm not going to show you any. And so he's like, like basically putting his knuckle into my rib, he's mounted, smothering me and rubbing his knuckle into my ribs and I'm just laying there like taking it and just thinking about other things. And, and actually I'm thinking like when I get on top and, and then the timer ran out and he kept doing it and he kept doing it any to kept doing it for like another 30 seconds.

Speaker 2:          01:24:08       And then he laughed and he jumped off. So then we were going again and I, I got him into got a good position, right? I got him in the arm lock and I'm sitting there and he's already finished, you know, if you don't believe me, go watch him. Go again. John Jay and Metamorris and there's John Jay, one of the best Jujitsu practitioners of all time goes for a normal walk on Dean Dean gets out of it. So I'll go in for an arm lock on Dean and the timer goes like at the end of the round and in and he's like, Oh God, here. He goes, oh, because I didn't let go. And he goes, he goes, I said, you violated the Jujitsu Geneva Conventions on the last round. And he laughed and then I let them go. But uh, you, no, it's all good then. It's kind of what that is.

Speaker 2:          01:24:57       Well look, I tapping you don't let go. That's a violation of the Geneva Convention. Convention's yeah, it's true. But you can't, you can't be breaking those laws. The metcon and getting into condition, losing like little bit of weight or whatever. Sure. It gets, in my case, it got me in better shape and you can go longer, less classic flavor just in general. But the bigger impact was that that's not something I have to worry about anymore. Dealing with Ba when I get tired and mentally you become, you know what? It feels like to be tired because I don't think you knew what that felt like before. It was hard to deal with. I would say that's how it felt to me. Like what? I'm like, Dang, I'm tired. I need to not be tired. That's the goal now. I don't care about getting tapped out anymore. It's the tiredness is, is really the fight that demon here, not the topping up, but once you go the Mecca nut, like I said, the metcon and just muscular conditioning in general, it'll sure it'll get you in shape.

Speaker 2:          01:25:57       But since you have to kind of do it all the time for it to work, like any exercise you're used to it, that feeling, he comes comment, what do you just knocked your lady when you're mentally inoculated to, oh, I'm out of breath. I'm not you. What you used to think was, I'm out of breath and I'm going to die. How you think I'm out of breath and that's okay. I'll recover. Yes. Want to cover in some other position and man, it makes Jujitsu way, funner, way funner. You can disclose nd two 10 minute rant, you know with the thing and he's, and he's going to hard and it was like, sure, you're bull. You know it's a good, good workout but it's, yeah, it's just makes it way funner for sure. But yeah, the point is there. That's why you can endure tiredness is when you're having a good time.

Speaker 2:          01:26:39       When those little payoff, do you ever notice, even if you don't really roll that how you might be different? Actually no, I'm sure you feel this when you go home you feel like the heat radiating from your body still. You know, even after you go home and like Dan didn't really roll that hard cause it doesn't feel like it's that hard cause it was so fun, you know? Yeah. Well I I real hard every single time. It's the genius behind it anyway. If you want help the performance, was that just a 14 or a 20 minute talk about [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko. Sure. Cool. Yeah, a little bit of some digression but these are all helpful things though. They are very helpful on it. That's just going to improve your performance straight up. Indeed. If you want to improve performance, which we do, there's another one, I'm going to go into it.

Speaker 2:          01:27:29       We got some time. So I'm filling up water, you know, you know the big gallons of water or five gallons. So go ahead, fill up. I got four of them. So I put them in the back of my car. In the back seat. Yeah. So when I bring them from the water filler thing to my car and grabbing them both and I'm walking across the street. You had to or you had four? I had four but two at a time. I feel too, cause it's two things, whatever. So they're full. I'm walking across the street to, you know, not the street, the parking lot to my car to put them in. And I'm like, this isn't even hard. But they look kind of big, you know. And I'm like, this isn't even hard cause it's like I'm not like stiff. It's not like I'm warmed up ready, don't get after it. You know, I'm like, okay, but, and you're walking there at handles so it shouldn't be that hard for someone my weight and whatever. So I get to the car and I put them in, but I'm like, Hey, I need more room to put the other two so I don't just trying to lug them in all perfect for, I got to like stretch and put these, you know they're five pound jugs. What I see, you got to stress these awkward position, but I did it kind of no problem.

Speaker 2:          01:28:33       If I were in, I've been at times where I'm not in that good a shape, my joints are off bro. I would to do, I would hurt myself. That's how you hurt your back because that is what I'm saying how people are, they're back doing the dumb stuff because they're not, they're not in good shape. Yeah, and that's a lot of times that's really what it is is because your just, your body's not used to like moving all of a sudden like that. But if it is and you've got the Krill oil going, that's the kind of things you can do. Almost like a superpower anyway. If you want these amazing supplements. No, they're the best ones cause we all know that on it.com/jocko 10% off. Support Yourself. Support everyone anyway.

That is cool to me that that's cool. But if you do want to support, but you still think that that's not that big of a deal. Maybe I'll support another way or something like that, that that's cool, but it's not true. That is a big deal. Yeah, it's a small action. So it may not seem like a bit of, it's like I'll just click through and that's kind of it.

Speaker 2:          01:29:55       But it's a big deal and it doesn't cost you anything. It doesn't cost you anything to second. Ron's got some money that they want to give to us.

So it's like a circle triangle, three people, three parties, triangle, let's support. Yeah. Then you get, you know your stuff.

Itunes, stitcher, Google play and various others outlet and somebody posted that you can, if you have Alexa, do you know what Alexa is?

Gotcha. So just you want to hear the show Jocko when you say yes and then it says I'm finding the latest episode and then it plays. John podcast is kind of like, uh, like uh, it'd be silly. You want to watch uh, Restrepo movie the song this, but then the song is called love song or something like this. Yeah. You know, the song would probably be called destroy planet earth. Right. In your case, for sure. For sure. That's something that, yeah, that thing, that thing is kind of cool to start to ask it.

Speaker 2:          01:31:38       Do you have one? Okay. So ask him, ask it. Well, what's one plus one there? She's going to say the sum of one plus one is two, but I think you already knew that. So they will, you know, he knows the little things anyway. Yeah, that's a good one. Anyway, I subscribe to the podcast on iTunes and all the various outlets. If you're not in Thai tunes specifically and on Youtube we do have a youtube channel, put some videos on there, constantly working on these videos. Situation.

Jocko also dad, ted talk that I did, she is on Youtube right now on the toe. Gold Ted Jocko Willink. Ted Talk or something like that. Yeah, you'll get to see it.

Speaker 2:          01:32:31       It's good. I talked about uh, you know, war and stuff like that. A little concept called extreme ownership. Nailed it. It's actually good like that. That's the one where you know how you got, you got to condense it down obviously, you know, like distill it down. That was a good distillation. Those good points. 12 minutes, not long. There you go. Yup. Youtube. But yeah, I subscribe to the, to the, you know, the youtube channel. We've got one of those. I'm also, Jack was a store called Jocko store Url Jocko store.com if you're into shirts, discipline equals freedom and Twitter was like, I like the Oji discipline equals freedom. There's only one version of the desert, but the thing is Julie, Oh gee, the original, the original discipline equals freedom. Super simple to the point, if you will, a good quality. I made sure that they were good quality shirts.

Speaker 2:          01:33:28       I'm not the kind, you just give away at the Ballpark, you know that kind of, yeah. You used to talk about those shirts that you give away at the ballpark. You haven't mentioned that in awhile. Yeah, because that one's cool because Ooh, free stuff, but when you get home you don't wear it. No, because this one sucks. Yeah, it's not good. It's not wearable. You know that one where you're like, your friend gives you the free shirt and they're like what I did for you and then you're like [inaudible] wearing. It's like it doesn't fit good and whatever. These ones like fit good. They're solid. In fact, this guy, Ryan, I know he said it's my favorite shirt to wear because it makes me look good. Like it fits, you know, it's fucking dope. I don't observe stuff like anyway, I may never make a made them. I'm here to win.

Speaker 2:          01:34:15       Oh yeah. You don't care what you look like, but yeah, they're good. Solid. Look at them. I'm not saying by shirt. Just go to the chocolate store.com. Go there, look at the shirts you like to shirt. Do you want to represent you want to support, get a shirt, get a rash guard. Got some good reviews on the rash guard. Multiple instances of increasing performance and results with the rash guard. Proven and against Jockos philosophy. Damon, they look good. You know, if you care, you know that you want to look good. Hey man, there's that element as well. Layers. Yeah. I'm more concerned about the performance in the looks. Yeah, man. So I'll take that 19% minimum bonus. Yeah. You look good to go. I guess actually that kind of thing. Sure. Patches. The velcro lenses. A regular kind too. Um, but the velcro one with the, the what do you call the color right there.

Speaker 2:          01:35:14       Regulation. Yeah. The one you can wear. I saw, um, shoot, I forget his name on Twitter. He showed me his patch like collection to the Velcro, you know, discipline equals freedom was all up in there. It was good. Looked real good. And this one is a big one to support yourself. Psychological warfare is literal like support, like a spot. The feedback from everyone out there on psychological warfare, it's 100% of fat. We'll do listen to the track sugarcoated lies. If you listen that track, you could be in Krispy Kreme donuts after not eating for three days and you will go in there. You listened to that track, you will not eat a donut. You will not know. It's true. It's absolutely true. And the wake up thing to wake up and I was going to say the wake up, you will get out of bed. Yeah, because, because you, this is the thing, you know what's being told to you is true.

Speaker 2:          01:36:19       No, it's true. Yeah. Man. You, you, part of your brain is Tang. You know what? It's not true. We just get up right now and one donuts not gonna kill. Actually it is going to kill you so you're not going to eat it. Yeah. Psychological warfare. That's a good one. By the way. I listened to it or listening to yourself sometime. He will. You know what I was kind of like, why do I actually listen to this now? Now I listened to it. Well, it, it could actually in a way be more effective for you because it's really you talking to yourself, Shirley. Me. Yeah. It's like you talking to yourself like your brain. It's like the voice in your head. It's true and this is a good one. Just like the Krill oil and just like the on it stuff. It's not like like get up and get after it.

Speaker 2:          01:37:04       Like it's not like, wait, let me explain what it is. It's these tracks on an album. You can buy it from iTunes and it's on Amazon. Other resources to find it. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's every, you can just purchase these MP three tracks and you can play in your phone before you're about to be, when you're having moments of weakness, you're going to skip the workout cause you don't feel like it. Are you going to skip, you're going to mess up your diet because you're doing old and it looks so delicious or you want to press snooze on the thing. You can put it as your alarm or whatever. You buy these tracks and there for different situations and it'll give you a little spot. We'll say that chocolate will be there to give you a little spot anyway. Their mental, a mental spot. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:37:44       Psychological, psychological there. They don't fight the urge to be a slacker crush, but it's good because it's not like the get up and get out. It's scares you out of bed so you'll get out of bed. It's not that, it's like psychological warfare. It tells your mind to do things the certain way, you know? So it's really, you're doing it and it's like, it's not a kinetic strike. It's psychological warfare, which is actually more effective. Yeah. Cause you're doing that. It's like the cortisone shot versus the cruel. We prefer to let our body do the work. Yes, exactly right. And we prefer to let our mind do the work. If you're getting out of bed cause someone's yelling out of you. Okay, well that's okay. But it's better if it's you that gets yourself out of bed because you use psychological warfare on yourself. Yup.

Speaker 2:          01:38:31       Cause you did, you did good things with the information that you were presented with is good. And I'll add, I'll give it to you. Oh, I'm going to pat you on the back. Pat On the back number. It was psychological warfare was number one. Is it stolen my nine on iTunes since day one. Oh well hey, don't, don't pat me on the back. Thank you everyone that's gone in and bought psychological or for, thank you. Yeah. That's awesome. Yeah, fully. But you gotta admit, it's like, you know you did that thing, you know. No, actually you got to admit that. If no one wanted to hear it and wanting to get after it, then I would be Dan and myself. We're like a little group of like, this is a good, good thing we're doing here. You know, get everybody out of bed and stop eating donuts.

Speaker 2:          01:39:14       Thinking of good things. If you want some Jocko white tea, sure it's in stock. It's on Amazon. If you're an America, get it on Amazon. If you're in a foreign country, go to Ebay, parole resourcing. It's the official listing. You can get it there, do you? You already know what, what the tea is going to do for you. You already know that you are weak, you will become strong. You are stupid. You're going to become smart. You are lazy. You're going to become aggressive. Just going to solve all your problems. Do you know what? That's the side effects because it also just tastes good. So which ones are going to go and I'll tell you what. Right now we are assessing and likely going to put Jocko white tea in cans. Old, right? Like the drink an energy drink doesn't help you. Right? Right. It's tea.

Speaker 2:          01:40:16       It's wack. Yeah. This is boom. Oh you're in seven 11 good stuff like sugar, Caffeine, candy, negativity, stimulator. Boom. Here you go. Hmm. Is there caffeine and Jocko white tea? Yes, there is a little bit, a little bit, but it's good for you actually a little bit and Mike. Exactly. Thank you. Echo micro dose. Not going to get you all jittery. So Jocko white tea, you can get it on Amazon when you're on Amazon you can pick up the book. Extreme ownership by me and my brother Leif Babin and what's cool is our company echelon front.

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       We work with a bunch of different kinds of companies, leadership and management consulting and it's always cool to see and hear about how the book spreads through those companies. Somebody, you know, somebody heard about it, somebody heard me on Tim Ferriss or so some of you heard me on Joe Rogan or somebody you've heard me on this podcast and it gets in there and a guy it spreads. It just spread. You know a guy buys it for his team and then he buys it for, you know, the CEO gives them a gift and the CEO buys it for everyone. So it's really cool to see that. And it's cool to see how it helps companies align their culture and align their leadership teams. So go out, get it for the people you work with, give them the tools to lead. And you know, the deal is you make a little investment getting the book.

Speaker 1:          01:41:49       It's 20 bucks, right? You give that book to your key team members, it's gonna make your life easier. Return on investment, good to go. And while you're doing that, you can get this book, another book right here. It's um, it's called way of the warrior kid. And this is the deal. This is what we have to watch out for. Order it now. Why order it now for not going to get it until May 2nd. That's when it comes out. Here's why. If we don't order it now, it's going to happen. The same thing that happened with Jocko white tea, the people that are printing is going like, oh no one's ordering it. So we're not going to, you know, we'll print 12 copies the day it comes out. We're going to get a lot of orders and everyone's going to have to sit around and wait for the thing to be printed. So what we want to do is give them the indication that yes, book is coming out. We don't want to end up with Jocko white tea style, Barron Armageddon on our hands to with the book and I'll tell you it is, you know, it's a book. It's a key. It's a kid's book admittedly, but I'm going to tell you uncle Jake, who's in the book, who teaches his nephew how to get after it. Uncle Jake's got some lessons for a very buddy about discipline, about working out, about overcoming fear, about diet and exercise and life.

Speaker 1:          01:43:12       It's a book about life and know should I, should I read? How did you get the, I know he's got a physical copy or a physical copy that I'm holding in my hands right now is called the Galley and they give you, it's so that you can see and make sure and you can go through it and correct it like a final answer, like a final edit. And this one's pretty good. Close. Give us a taste. So here we go. So at this point, here's what's going on. Um, at this point, basically the kid mark, he's like I said, he does know how to do, he can't do any pull ups, doesn't know his times tables. He's getting picked on at school, doesn't know how to swim. Guess what? He's a 10 year old kid in life. Life is hard. He's realizing that he's bummed out. He's been sad. His uncle Jake comes to live with him for the summer. His uncle, his uncle Jake, he used to be in the seal teams. He's getting out so he can go to college. But during the summer he's living with his sister. So now when Uncle Jake realizes that mark as all these issues, like I said, what does he say when mark freaks out and cries and says, I go, cause it's Jews. Uncle Jake says, good, we can solve these problems. And then he says, look, you

Speaker 3:          01:44:30       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:44:31       you're not really getting after it. Do you? Do you need to be? Instead of being this kind of wimpy kid over here, you need to be a warrior kid. And mark sort of what's a warrior kid? And so at this point they're, they're talking about like, do you actually know what a warrior is? And I'll go back to the book right now. So here's uncle Jake. Do you even know what a warrior is? Mark says yes. I mean, I guess I know a warrior is someone who fights and wars, right? And Uncle Jake says that is one part. But what else? I'm not sure what else. So do you think that the only way to be a warrior is to fight in wars? And do you think that any one who fights and wars is a warrior? I guess so.

Speaker 3:          01:45:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:45:29       Well, you guessed wrong. There was a lot more to being a warrior that just being in a war warriors or people that stand up for themselves, they face challenges. Warriors work hard to achieve goals. They have the discipline to overcome their weaknesses. Warriors are people that constantly try to test and improve themselves. And yes, war is the ultimate test. But not all warriors go to war and then Marxists. But how can a kid be a warrior?

Speaker 3:          01:46:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:46:04       And uncle mark says, or uncle Jake says, by doing everything I just said, a normal kid doesn't push himself. A warrior kid does. A normal kid doesn't work to constantly improve himself. A warrior kid does. I look at all these problems you cried to me about yesterday. A warrior kid wouldn't cry about those problems or war. Your kid would do something about those problems and then mark says, do what? Do what? Do whatever it takes. Every problem you have can be overcome. Every one of them you can't do pullups you work out and get stronger and to you can you don't know your times tables you study. Train your mind until you know them cold. You can't swim. You learn how you get picked on. You learn how to fight. Fight. I asked, yes. Fight. Just like anything else in the world, there are techniques to fighting, like learning a sport and when you know the techniques and practice them, you can defend yourself from anyone. You really think I could learn all that. I know you can. Like I told you last night, I had to transform myself when I got in the navy. I had to get stronger, I had to learn to fight. I even had to learn to learn, but I did it and if I did it, so can you, do you want to, do you want to overcome all these challenges you face of course

Speaker 3:          01:47:45       and

Speaker 1:          01:47:46       then as a wrap up that conversation they were out in the park when they're doing that and mark says we walked through the park and back to the house without saying another word. Something had already changed.

Speaker 1:          01:48:00       Sounds like we're about to get after it. So yeah, a fun book might want to get after it and also on top of that the book is coming out May 2nd that's cool. May 4th and fifth guess what's going on. The muster right there. Marriott Marquis in New York City. Basically two months away from right now. So sign up, book your ticket, get your hotel room.
