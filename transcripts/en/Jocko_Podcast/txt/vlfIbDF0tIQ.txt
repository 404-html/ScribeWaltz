Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 99 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. It is a day for Q and. A. Let's go right into it. All right, let's do it Jocko. Hey Jocko. As the director of our sales department, I require my guys to fill out sales call interaction logs. I have one guy who thinks because the sales are up, this no longer is important, nor does he have the time. How did you handle situations like this? Okay, so as I got this question mark, okay, I've answered this before, I'm not going to answer it again. I've gotten something close enough and you know it's interesting, I talked to some people now, I talked to a lot of people and they say, hey, you know on a Q and a, I know what you're going to say. Yeah. You know, and I'm like, Oh yeah, that's awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:00:50       They say, I still need to hear it. Sure. But I know what you're going to say and I should. Okay, cool. That's good. That means, you know, people are are starting to expand their brain a little bit. Maybe. See a different perspective that they might not have had before, so that's good in my opinion right now. Also, what I realized is as you mentioned, as I answered these questions, there's additional information, right? That comes out. Once you make a certain level of understanding, then there's more understanding to be had and so that's what I realized with this question as I thought, well, okay, there's the standard answer, right? The standard answer is okay that you got people in there not doing what you want them to do and what do you do then? Well, the fact is the real standard answer that everybody now knows if you've been listening to podcasts is they need to know why they're doing what they're doing.

Speaker 1:          00:01:37       They need to know why it's important. They need to know how them filling out those forms will help the company and therefore help the individual that needs to fill out the forms because it'll provide better intel with to the company that will provide them more accurate advertising, which will in turn make them be able to sell more, which will in turn make the cost to produce the product. Go down because they're selling more and that means he has better pricing to sell things with and he'll be able to sell more and make more money. And so you have to tie that whole thread through. That's kind of the standard answer, which everybody should know. If someone's not doing what you want them to do, you need to make sure they understand why they need to do it, why it's important, how it ties back to them.

Speaker 1:          00:02:18       Okay, so boom, we get done with that standard answer. Now there's the next level. Right now we're going to purple belt and, and here's the nonstandard answer. Here's the advanced dancer with a purple belt. The answer is, okay, now let's ask yourself this piece of paper that you're having them fill out. Is it really actually important? Is it actually important? What purpose does it actually serve? Because you're, you want this guy who's a, who's a good producer, his sales are up and you want him to continue to fill out these sales interaction logs so that you can and make sure that he's making enough calls, that he's got to write the right approach, that he's using the right verbiage when he's talking to his customers or clients. And so you want him to fill this out, but now he's actually doing well and you got to ask yourself like, okay, what purpose is this thing serving now that the guy is doing well, what purpose is it serving? Maybe at a certain level you say, you know what? You don't need to fill that out anymore. If you'd sell 10 units a day, you don't need to fill this out anymore. If you sell eight a day, you've got to fill out your logs because we got to check and see what you're doing.

Speaker 1:          00:03:33       That's, or are you just making this person do it because that's what everyone does.

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       So if you can't, if you can't answer the question yourself, why it's important, then maybe you should check the why you have this thing in place. So again, we put things in place to help people, but at a certain point it is possible that they don't need to do it anymore. The some salespeople, if you don't, maybe you want people to make eight phone calls a day and you want them to log down what they did, okay? What if this guy is doing 28 phone calls a day and he wants to get to 38 phone calls a day, but he can't because he's filling out your paperwork, okay? So if people are meeting the numbers, maybe raise the bar a little bit, make him and you give him more freedom. He's got the self discipline, right? He's got the discipline to make call. He's making the numbers is numbers are up. Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:04:31       give us more freedom. Maybe can turn that into more production. If he starts to lag off, guess what? Hey Bud, if you keep selling 10 units a day, we're good. You don't need to fill out this crap. You go to nine, you're back on the back on the filling out of paperwork. Guess what he's going to do? You're going to sell 10 every day, is going to sell 12 going to sell 15 and then I would tell him, I'd say he, look, if you sell 15 units a day, I'm going to fill out a piece of paperwork that says you're awesome dude. Every time you sell 15 units, boom. Little Fun. Yeah. So that's it. There's, there's the, there's the white, maybe three stripe white belt answer. Everyone should know at this point followed by a little bit more advanced purple belt move Ooma Plata at the same time.

Speaker 1:          00:05:17       That's not to say that it's guaranteed, not important. Not at all. You just see and make that evaluation at all. And there there is a chance that I'm wrong, right? That the paperwork that gets filled out actually really does get put into a data file that can then be used to, to, you know, target certain customers that follow up with certain customers. And if that's the fact you explain it to the guy and how it's going to benefit them. And we're back to answer number one, which worked, which is fine. Yeah know, right and wrong, right and wrong are interesting concepts and people sometimes get wrapped around right and wrong and they just think that there's a right answer and there's a answer and many times neither question or neither answer is right or wrong or both answers are right and wrong. So you got to open your mind on these things.

Speaker 1:          00:06:09       You got to open your mind. You know, it was, as we talked about with Jujitsu schools, should a judge, should a Jujitsu school be strict bow to your professor? Everyone wear the same uniform? I'm not allowed to ask people to role or should it be, hey, where whatever you want the instructor's named Jocko and go in there and crews and train heart. Which one is right? The answers, they're both right. You can. Both of those have benefits and some people flourish in one kind of school and some people flourish and and other kind of school and you can't say one's right or wrong. Same thing. I used to run in this a lot with in the seal teams with tactics, like should we enter the room like this or like this? And the answer is actually, well, which is better in that scenario. And sometimes this one's veterans, sometimes that one's better. And so if your mind can be more open, you'll be able to use more options, which is beneficial.

Speaker 2:          00:07:02       Yeah, that's the narrow kind of reminded me of one of my, who was a friend of a friend and it was actually my friend's friend's wife and she was saying, yeah, she's kind of making light of the fact that they force their kids to watch a charger game or something on this day or whatever. And the kids don't like football or the kid, the one kid don't like, doesn't like football. It doesn't like watching football doesn't like this whole thing. She, and she was like, oh no, it's an, it's a tradition, you know, so you know, we make them do it. It's the tradition, all this stuff. I'm kind of thinking like, okay, I mean that's cool that it's like your tradition, but like no one likes it. Like, so what is the tradition doing? I mean, I understand like if you have a tradition, everyone likes it or the tradition and it improves. Like I don't know if the cohesion of the family in or something like that and you know, for all these beneficial reasons and one way or another beneficiary, but if you're doing it just for the sake of, you know, the tradition, like this paperwork situation

Speaker 1:          00:08:04       and also what are you doing if you're telling your kid like, no, you'll watch the football game. Yeah. Especially now that everyone hates the chargers because they left San Diego sometime ago. But if you tell your kid, hey, no, it's a time for our family to get together and you don't got to watch the game but hang out, we're going to have some hot dogs. Yeah. You know what I mean? And, and we're just, that's what it is. It's not about staring at the screen watching something that you don't like. Yeah. It's about hanging out. You know, grandma's coming over, auntie's coming over, we're going to cruise, we're going to eat barbecued chicken, right? Yup. That's different than, hey, you sit down and watch the football game. Yeah. But when kids reach a certain age, they don't want to hang out with you for a certain time period. That's what started my whole argument right there. It wasn't an argument, but that's what started my little discourse at a certain time period. Your children are supposed to

Speaker 3:          00:08:55       rebel against you? Yeah, somewhat. Cause they, cause they have to convince themselves in their mind that they're going to leave, they're going to be on their own and something in their mind triggers that to be like, okay, I need to separate myself from these other humans that have been caring for me since I was wearing diapers and now I need to get that out of my head and figure out how to survive on my own. So they do that by rebelling against you and said, I don't wash this stupid football game. Yeah. I want to go to my friend Mary's house. Yeah. We're going to do something over there. Right. That's, yeah. Do you think that there's an element of like a pro, you know how like when you're a kid and you hit like 1312, 13 years old, you start to get this like empowered feeling, you know, cause you're like physically kind of growing up and then your parents are kind of, you have the feeling of oppression, not that your parents are the pretzels things are totally, that's exactly what I'm saying.

Speaker 3:          00:09:48       I'm like it's those like an actual rebellion. Like you can oppress me no more. Don't have to ride with you. You know, I don't have to walk with you in the mall. No, I'm out. Yeah. And you're trying to do that cause you realize subconsciously that these people are not going to be here. I need to learn how to fend for myself. I need to get out of the nest, get out of them, start flapping them wings. But yeah, exactly right. But the tradition, just for the sake of the tradition, because actually my whole argument with the lady was that you was trying to, not necessarily prove but try to find out whether or not she even thought about it. Like, why you [inaudible] traditions that are important, right. Within a family, within a culture. But if you lose fact, if you lose, if you don't understand the meaning of the tradition, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:10:38       Then it doesn't make sense to you. Yeah. So then you don't care about it. Yeah. But if you say, hey look, this is our family and this is when we get together. This is the only time it's her tradition, so we're gonna do it. Yeah. And that way we get to know each other and that week we keep connected. You know, we can help each other. Cohesion, cohesion. Next question Jocko. As a leader, at what point am I allowed to go to others and say, I need you because I recognize I'm not capable of pushing toward forward on my own. Or should that be an instance where I need to take a step back and apply more discipline to my life and find a way to push forward by myself. Okay. You are allowed to say that to your team member immediately that you need them. Absolutely. If you, of course you need your team because if you didn't need your team, why would they be there? If you can do everything yourself, then you don't have a team, right? You just do everything yourself. So while you of course should be working harder, you should be applying discipline as a leader. It's your job to actually lead things and to let other people support and make things happen. And there's nothing wrong with that. And also you don't want to be stuck in the weeds doing minute thing. So

Speaker 1:          00:11:57       if you're not capable, I think what might be holding this individual back, there's two things. Number one is I feel like I should take extreme ownership of everything. Yeah. I feel like I should just do everything myself. That is not what extreme ownership is. Extreme ownership isn't doing everything yourself. And also what can come into play is your ego because you don't want to ask people for help and that's not a good sign. There's nothing wrong with asking people for help if you need it. In fact, that's the humble thing to do. Hey Echo, I don't know how to quite finish out this. Uh, you know, this thing of this project and working out. Can you give me a hand with us? I don't know how to work a video recorder. Can you show me how to do that, right? Whatever. Um, so, so there's no problem with that.

Speaker 1:          00:12:36       You're allowed to ask. You can, you can say that immediately. In fact, your team should feel that you are counting on them and relying on them. They should know that. And then put your ego aside. Ask for help. No problem. That doesn't mean you're giving away. That doesn't mean you're not taking ownership. That doesn't mean you're not applying discipline. It means you're working as a team together to accomplish a mission. Again, if a t if a, if a mission is so easily that you can accomplish it yourself, you don't need a team, why do you have them? If you can do it all yourself just by applying discipline, cool. You don't need anyone else if you're, but your mission should be larger than one human being can accomplish. So that's why you have other people on board to help you out. No problem. You know, like, I always think when I thought we made it out of that question, go ahead.

Speaker 1:          00:13:19       Nope. But you know, like let's say it's like something that's just a pain in the ass and you don't really need help, but you just don't want to do it by yourself. Oh, okay. I'm then, yeah, the then you gotta just do it yourself. Yourself. Yeah. Yeah. So that's kind of where this is coming from ultimately, because it's like, I'm not saying that if you're the, if you're, if you have a position in a company where you shouldn't be doing some sort of task because it's not financially efficient to have, you know, a person that's making $150,000 a year doing a task that someone that's making $10 an hour should be doing so. So you shouldn't do that. That's not what I'm advocating and accompany won't, won't be doing well if you're paying people $150,000 a year that you can get someone to do for $10 an hour.

Speaker 1:          00:14:11       I'm not saying that, so don't get me wrong. Yeah. But that's why we have a team so that you can focus on going forward and whatever it is you need to be focused on and somebody that's below you in the chain of command, that's a member of your team that's getting paid $10 an hour can do some of this stuff that you need them to do. Yeah. Yeah. And the question actually is really clear because it's because quote unquote, because I recognize I'm not capable of pushing, you know, it's kind of like, it's obvious to you that you need help. It's not that you're, you know, raking leaves and I don't want to do this all by myself, so hey, you know, you tell your brother come help.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       It's not that it's different.

Speaker 1:          00:14:53       Yeah. If you need to get to the leaves raked and, and you need them done by Monday so you can get them in the bags so that the dump truck can come and take the leaves away and you can't physically get it done. Then your, you said to your brother, Hey, can you give me a hand on you? You get these done tonight before the sun goes down. I'm not going be able to make it in time. Can you give me a hand? Yeah. Your brother says absolutely.

Speaker 2:          00:15:14       Oh yeah. Got Your back. Next question. What's the best way to deal with feedback? You don't agree with my manager? Give my manager, gives me feedback on my personality that I don't agree with. I'm only in the company five months and he doesn't know enough about me to make the comments he's making. I find myself wanting a con wanting to contest with what he's saying, but I believe this will ultimately end poorly for me. It's frustrating for me to listen to feedback from him about my personality when my friends and family would disagree with him.

Speaker 1:          00:15:53       Okay. Again, this is one of those questions that I think people that listen to podcast and know what the answer is, what you do when someone's giving you feedback, as you listen to it and you try and make adjustments, get in their head and figure out where this is coming from. They're obviously saying this for some reason, and maybe the reason is because they have a big ego or they don't understand people very well, and that's fine. And if you know that, then you just learned something about them. But also you might not know yourself as well as you think you do. And, and obviously if you can test with someone saying you're going to look like you can't take critique, so you're right, that's not a good approach to take. Furthermore, what you're saying is that your friends and family wouldn't agree with this guy.

Speaker 1:          00:16:39       Well, guess what? They're your friends and family, right? It's like the dude's mom that, you know, the dude's mom always thinks the dude's handsome, right? Losing on handsome, but his mom thinks he's handsome and he's, you know, your friends and family think, oh I, I can't believe they'd say that about you. Well that's your friends and family. There's a reason why you have friends because they like you, they, whatever purse part of your personality is, is not cool. They're over it. Or they can deal with it. Well this, this boss, the manager can't deal with it. His know how to deal with it yet. So like I said, when someone gives you a critique, you should actually listen to what people have such a hard time with. And you should actually listen and say, okay, well maybe I'm too aggressive. Maybe I'm too close minded. Whatever, whatever critique point you're getting, listen to them. Maybe someone's like, Hey, I don't think you take critique very well. And you're like, what are you talking about? Of course I take critique. Well you don't know what. That's what, that's my point. So, and the other thing, like I said, isn't doing this. The managers actually telling you something about their personality and, and their views, their judgment.

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       So learn from that. Learn what they're pretty, they're teaching you about their personality, which is going to help you better influence and nippy late and work with. Work with that person in the future and perhaps help make them into a better leader and a better supporter of what it is that you're trying to do. So calm down, relax. One of the best things you can do when someone, when someone says to you, Hey, I think you're screwing this up as I call it. Hold on, let me, let me, let me grab a notebook. I just want to take notes and make sure I understand where you're coming from so I can, I can make some adjustments. I'm always looking to get better.

Speaker 3:          00:18:28       That might be a little extreme, but you know, yeah, no, hold on a second. Let me get my notebook. Yeah, so I can take notes because I want to get better. I over did that just a little bit. Tell him. Yeah, but not some people, some new, they'll take notes, taking notes like, oh, when I was, when I was running the west coast seal training, the, the good officers. Like there'd be some officers when when I'd be putting out word to them, they'd be taking notes and I was eating, when I first saw it, it was kind of like surprise me. Yeah. Um, okay. This guy is just straight up taking notes on what I'm telling you is a one on one conversation, but he's, he's sitting there like taking notes.

Speaker 3:          00:19:10       But if you said it with your tone would be like, hold on. All jock was going to say something. Let me get out my notebook. Oh No. Yeah, that's sarcastic. Yeah. But there's also not just being sarcastic. I was leaning towards more like the Brown noser. Oh, that guy. Oh, Echo. You're going to give you some feedback. Hold on one second. I want to get my notes out so I can make sure I do exactly what you're telling me to do. Thanks buddy. I see again with the tone that was the middle way. The middle ground I think. Yeah. Who is it? Sarah Armstrong I think pointed out on Twitter something about tone and body language in some psychological survey makes up more than half of what is actually being said. Yeah. And I heard that too. Um, and I was like, hey, that sounds cool. But I mean, you know, maybe, maybe not because if someone says something that's pretty clear but then I, it's kind of stuck with me and it's true.

Speaker 3:          00:20:03       I could literally say the same like I dunno 10 words to you in all these different tones and that would mean 10 different things. Oh for sure. Like you can like it's actually baffling in surprising how much we can actually communicate. Like if I, if I make a joke to you like something you don't know, my level of sarcasm, you don't know necessarily, you have to know the person, you know. So there's all these things that that have to be in place for you to effectively be communicated to. So like let's say you overhear a conversation in the next room. Like you could easily miss the whole point of the conversation even though you heard every word because you didn't know if they're joking. You didn't know if they're serious. You didn't know if one guy's mad. You know if one guy's getting school district and they can take the same exit or they can say the same exact words, but they're just saying different things coming from different places.

Speaker 3:          00:20:52       You end up a lot of communication problems with email where someone emails a joke. Yeah, joking about something and then someone takes it seriously and next thing you know, people are flying off the handle. I always had that rule in my seal platoons and tasking do. You weren't allowed to joke on the radio and the main reason for that rules cause you, you don't want other people outside your organization to hear it and take it the wrong way. Same thing, but at the same thing with email. Unless you know someone really, really well, really, really well, you better. It's better to keep the sarcastic comments and just be straightforward and speak plainly when you're an email, when you're communicating with people, it's a lot. It's a lot easier. And then even with that probably has no escape from this. Even with that, you could easily come off as like too rigid or Dang is this guy, does this guy not like me? You know like that's your second email. And he's like, that's why communication is important. That's why learning how to write well is important. That's why little words that you put in matter into phrases, into sentences, they matter. Make a difference. Thus the invention of emojis.

Speaker 3:          00:22:03       Emojis. No, you're very into emojis and I sometimes I I, I must say that I think you communicate very well with emojis because even though you don't sometimes use any words in a text to me, I fully understand what you mean by lightening bolt. Lightning bolt, lightning bolt, rainbow, rainbow, lightening bolt, thumbs up, chocolate fires. Shaka fire. Very clear, right? Yeah, no I yeah, yeah I agree. Yeah I agree with that. Shock. A fire. I forgot about fire. You do quite a bit of fire. Yeah, the lightening bolt and fire a youth and then the shotgun for sure. And the room with you. I use a rainbow a lot cause they got to lighten up the mood.

Speaker 3:          00:22:52       It seems like a child thing. I don't like emoticons. I don't like emojis. But you're kind of like that in real life too though. I know, but it's, it seems like to me it's, yeah, it's like a kid. Maybe your little daughter would do it. Well my daughter will send me 875 emojis from my wife's phone. All of them see if she can fill up and I sent back. Okay. Yeah, yeah. See, but you're like that in real life too though. That's the thing. Like if you, like if you, you know that you're running the risk of sounding too like, you know, like stoic or whatever, you know, like if you, if you have to answer a question with yes when, whatever the question is, it's a yes or no question and you answer yes affirmatively right it, you'll put yes. Period. And that'll come off as like God talk was like, I don't know what this guy is serious or something, you know, instead of yes. Point yes.

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       Two exclamation points. Lightening Bolt, fire rainbow or something like that. That gives away a little bit more like, you know, you're just like, yes. It's as if you're just looking someone in their eye going, yes, that's it. I know. That's what I'm saying. You're really like that in real life most of the time. Right on. Anyway. Lightening Bolt, fire. Yeah man. Let's emojis in there. Don't over do it. Double Shocker. Shocker. Yeah. What's the highest level of a moot Emoji approval? You can send me three lightening bolts. Three fires, three shockers, three rainbows. For sure. Three of everything you do go for. It's like you shouldn't do for four Don Murray, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:24:34       Depends on what I say though. So like if there's, if it's a word, the vowel in the word will, they'll be like, that's, that can be infinite or what do you like if I put it, I don't know, you know, like you'll tell me something exciting and I'll put it on and off, but Dang, instead of Dan g, I'll put d, lowercase a, depending on the level of excitement, Ei, EI, that can go infinitely by the way, that can spend 20 text messages even over 20 days because that's how infinite it can be. Then the first half of the A's and lowercase, the second half of the are uppercase, the end, maybe 10 ends. Geez. All capital. Then you know, then, so it depends. It just depends on it. Just like I said, I think you communicate well. Yeah, that's what I'm saying on a, on a serious note, in regards to communication that is effective, you know what I mean? You can sense my level of excitement as opposed to cool. Period. No, you're, you're, you were your quick fix.

Speaker 2:          00:25:47       Like, anyway, next question if you're ready. All right. Sorry. No, no. All good. Here is a good mood. I guess the rainbow does things dearest Jocko. Speaking of lighthearted, uh, nice emotions dearest Jocko. Oh, okay. My bad, my bad, my bad. Jocko. What is the difference between extreme ownership versus the easy button? Can you elaborate? I just need a little more clarification to connect the dots in my situation. Okay. Again, so as a leader, yes, of course you are supposed to take ownership of everything. Extreme ownership of everything. That's what we talk about all the time. But does this mean that you say, I

Speaker 1:          00:26:43       will do this and I will do that and I will do the other thing and I will do everything that the team is supposed to be doing? No, that's not what I'm talking about. Now ownership does mean that you get things done. You are responsible for making sure things get done. That's what ownership is. It as our team is in charge of something. If our team is in charge of a project and, and we don't get it done, it's my fault. It's not anybody else's fault. So that's, that's what it is. It means you take responsibility when things go wrong. It means you take responsibility for problems and you get them fixed. That's definitely ownership. Now, the easy button and when I talk about the easy button in a negative way, because that's what I'm doing here, it's when your subordinates come to you and say, how should I do this?

Speaker 1:          00:27:29       Or, or what's the best way to execute this? Or can you, can you tell me a good plan on how we should make this happen? Or even, hey, there's bad news. Can you come tell my people because I don't really want to do it. Now. If you say yes to those types of things on a regular basis, then what you're doing is you're actually, you're actually stunting the growth of your subordinate leader because instead when you come to me and you say, Hey Jocko, we've got this semester, we've got a plan. How do you think we should do it? If I say, okay, we should come in from the north, you should, you know, set up an Overwatch position here. You should move to the target from this direction. You didn't learn anything. You just took what I told you. It's not. I say, well go, come up with your best plan and come back to me and brief me on it.

Speaker 1:          00:28:12       And so now you might be kind of bummed out because you wanted, you didn't have, want to have to do this extra work, but now you've got to go do a little extra work. But now you're learning and in two or three times, you're not even come to ask me any more. You're going to come with a plan. And because we already did a cycle cycle after cycle of you saying, Hey, here's my plan and be saying, hey, make this adjustment and you come back next time you say, here's my plan. I said make this little adjustment. And eventually, you know, to make those adjustments on your own and now you can do it by yourself. And that's what we want. I don't want to stunt the growth of my subordinate leaders, so I don't want to be an easy button. Um, so you're providing the easy button, like that's what they're talking about when they see easy button.

Speaker 1:          00:28:48       Yeah. If you didn't want to be that you don't want to be an easy button for everybody else. And I also, no one's going to be able to take your job from you, which is actually what you want. You want. I want to make every one of my subordinates so good that they can take my job from me. That means I can step up and look forward and look out and they can do a better job of handling what they've got to handle. And eventually when it's my time to get promoted, I got people to take my place and we're all good. Um, of course that doesn't mean leave them blind or let them fail. Don't do that. Give you want to give them rope, but you don't give them enough rope to hang themselves. You give them enough rope that they may be get a little not in the rope and it gives a little bit sloppy and you, and then you go over to me and say, there's a lot here.

Speaker 1:          00:29:30       Let me help you get that untied. And now you give them the rope again so you don't eat. You know, in, in, uh, in the military, you don't let someone go do a mission that's real where someone's gonna get killed or mission failure because you want it to not be the easy button. No, you don't do that in the civilian sector. You don't let someone lose a big client or lose a bunch of money or make a mistake that costs a bunch of capital because you didn't want to be the easy button. No, no ums. Now might you let someone make a little mistake? Sure. Little mistake that cost them a little bit of money. Sure. So they learned a lesson. Sure. Yeah, but you don't let them fall on your face. You don't let them hang or hang themselves. So that's that.

Speaker 2:          00:30:10       Next question. Dearest Jocko, a question for you and the podcast. Our Fire Department promotion process has role playing scenarios and those role playing scenarios. I lose points because I'm not outwardly passionate, quote unquote, you know, I would have to fake it to succeed and I'm not a fake person. Is this worth it to fake it when seeking promotion. It's not like I'm going to fake it once they attain the promotion.

Speaker 1:          00:30:40       Okay, great. This is a, this is a very cool question. I like this question a lot and actually on this guy sent me this question on Facebook, I responded very quickly and simply my response was, play the game. Yeah, so fake. You play the game and, and you know what he wrote back? Got It. Good for him. Because what everybody I think thinks I'm going to say is that no, you don't yourself. No, you don't play the game. You're not going to get up there and act all passionate about stuff. You're you, you're hardcore. No. Play the game now you, because what you're doing, you play the game. You want to do good job and you're doing your job and doing your job. To me, any job requires some level of faking it. Yeah. Now, does this mean that you're a fake person? No. It means that you're trying to do a good job.

Speaker 1:          00:31:29       I think if every time that your boss came in with a dumb idea and you, your reaction was to say, that's a dumb idea. Is that going to get you anywhere or every time a customer had an idiot, idiot, idiotic complaint about something, you were like, hey, you're an idiot. Or every time your wife said, you know, is this chicken dry? And you said it's dryer than a piece of cardboard in the Sahara desert. Is that, is that easy? You know, art, would you, would you benefit from that? How would that work out you? The answers you would, he would not work out well in any of those cases. You have to play the game. You have to play the game. And I know, I know that that's hard. And I'll tell you what I did to get myself over playing the game. I turned it into a game in my head.

Speaker 1:          00:32:32       I was like, I'm going to build a relationship with this boss that I don't like. I'm going to do it. Yeah. I'm going to build the best relate. That's my, I'm going to go, I'm going to become this guy's bro. Right when I was at officer candidate school, you got to do the most ridiculous rules. They have these rules that you've got to follow that were really annoying and you know what I did? I, I executed the rules harder and more stringently than, than anybody thought was even remotely necessary and had fun with it. I played that game. I, you know, if I've got a peer that may be, um, competing with, or there's some tension, I'm going to support them. I'm going to play the game. That's what I'm saying. You got to play the game. Now does this make me a bad person or a fake person?

Speaker 1:          00:33:20       No. Why? Because you're doing this, the reason you're playing the game, the reason your act as acting this way is for benevolent reasons, right? This, this guy at the fire department, he's not trying to get promoted so that he can usurp the powers and then take over. No, he tried to get into a position where he can better lead and serve and, and step up and raise young leaders underneath them that that's what you're trying to do. You're not trying to sneak into a position you don't deserve and you're not trying to build relationships so you can take advantage of people for your own benefit that that would be a fake person in my opinion. You're trying to move, but if you're trying to move up in rank so you can do better and you can take care of the troops and you can increase readiness, there's nothing wrong with that.

Speaker 1:          00:34:13       And if you don't play the game to us at some level, you're not going to get promoted. And guess what? Then people that played the game that might be less, less qualified to do that job, they're going to get the job because you wouldn't play the game. You're too stubborn. Your ego is too big. So you got to put that aside and I'll tell you something else. Learn from what you're being told. If if you're showing no passion, if you're showing like zero motion, that's bad. People will not connect with you. And if they don't connect with you, they don't follow you. If they don't connect with you, you're not building relationships with people. If you don't have relationships with people, you don't have a good team. So show a little bit of passion. Sometimes you gotta fake it. That's fine. You're just a really unpassionate person.

Speaker 1:          00:35:05       Cool. Show a little bit of passion, fake it a little bit, learn it a little bit cause it's actually going to be beneficial. I would love for you to fake it for a little while until you're, you start caring. Like what are you are not passionate about? Are you not passionate about the job? Are you not passionate about, you're a firefighter about saving people's lives are you're not passionate about having a squared away department? Of course you're passionate about that stuff. Otherwise you wouldn't be, you wouldn't be sending me a message saying, hey, how do I get advanced? How do I do? How do I do better? You are passionate about it and that's fine. It's

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       good. Um, I say it all the time. You know, if you don't have any emotions that you're a robot and robots, people don't fall robots, immune cell. Sometimes you got to show a little bit of that emotion and passion to connect with people. And that's okay. Yeah. Don't be scared, homey. Yeah. Don't be scared. Yeah. Cause that's really the thing, right, is showing it of course you're passionate about but showing it because different people, they know something. Brian, I dig it. I don't want to always be like showing how fired up I am all the time or whatever in whatever scenario, whatever. But you're right, that does help. Yeah. Like when he was excited about it. And there's a, there's a dichotomy here because there's some people that will show too much emotion and there's some people that will not show enough. So you want to be somewhere bounced in the middle.

Speaker 3:          00:36:23       Yeah. Yeah. It's true. And I dig it too when, cause it does feel like faking it because like in football that tradition is like to be fired up on the sidelines. Let's go, let's go, let's go. You know, like that kind of, but probably sometimes you don't have the energy for that and sometimes you're kind of just nervous and you want to focus on what you got to do or whatever, you know. But it's kind of part of the game, you know? And, and it does help the people around you too. And he's like, okay, he's fired up. Okay. Maybe I'm not fired up now, but he's kind of getting me fired up, you know? And it kind of like helps the team. Yeah. But yeah, sometimes it doesn't feel that comfortable to do express outwardly. You know, how passionate, but it helps. Plus this fake like faking it.

Speaker 3:          00:37:02       That's like a framing thing too. You know how like if you frame it like you're faking it versus how you said you're playing the game, right. You're playing the game because you want to do a better job. Yeah. Want to get promoted. You want to, you want to get promoted for the right reasons. Yeah. There's nothing wrong with that. Yeah. That's that. Yeah. That's good. I think if you can kind of bend and stretch yourself in an uncomfortable way for the benefit, you know, I, you know, I think where people, I think that term of faking it, no one wants to be a fake person, right? Yes. Which, which is why you're correct in that. The way that's framed is I'm being a fake person and no one wants to be a fake person. Yeah. At the same time, you have to grow and you have to adjust. And if you're going to be in a leadership position, you're Gunna do things that you don't, that you wouldn't have planned. I do that all the time. I mean, when I was in the military, you know, I worked with people that I, you know, I've said this before I could, where I work with people both below me, the chain of command and up above me in the chain of command that I despised. They never knew it. They don't know who they are right now. Dang.

Speaker 3:          00:38:14       But you know what? Remember that? What does that make me a fake person? No, it makes me a professional. Makes me a professional at doing my job because I wasn't gonna get let some little personal emotion of mind or some, oh that guys does this and I don't like that, so I'm not going to like him. And now we have an adversarial relationship and now we've got a problem. Yeah, no, I'm playing the game. Play the game.

Speaker 3:          00:38:38       So where's the line? What is a fake person? Genuinely, well, I was going to say, you asked me what the line is. The line is if you go against what your principles are, you know, so if you've got fundamental principles that they say, Oh, if you want this job, but what we need to you to do is fill out a report about Billy saying that he did something wrong, that you know he didn't do wrong. Right? And then you go, no, I'm not going to do that. That, that, that's what, that's bad. Right? That's not now you're not just playing the game. Now you're going against your principles of being a, an honest person about what's happening. Yeah. That's really what it is. Right? Like the honesty when you're a faker. So like if someone's like, oh, I'm faking it, or I'm being a fake person.

Speaker 3:          00:39:20       How you sit in a fake person, like turning on some passion, some manufactured passion for the sake of the team and stuff like that. That doesn't feel like you're a fake person, fake person. It's kind of like you'll sit like some, I dunno for example, someone's in the room and you're like, hey, you're great. That shirt looks great and you're doing a great job. They leave and be like, fuck, I suck so bad. The reason I'll tell you the difference, the reason that someone, the reason that you would consider someone and be angry that someone's a fake person is when they are doing it because they're doing it for personal benefit. Oh yeah. They're, they're saying like if, if, if, if you were my boss and I come in and I say, hey echo, I really like your new haircut. It looks great. I don't really think that your haircut looks done, but I'm going to say that anyways and everyone knows that.

Speaker 3:          00:40:05       All I want to do is get that next promotion. Yeah. That's being fake. Yeah. Makes Sense. Being fake. But if, if I'm saying, well, cause what am I really doing? What I'm doing is I'm, I'm, I'm making an adaptation. I'm growing. I'm, I'm doing something that I'm uncomfortable with because I know it's gonna make me a better leader. That's what I should be doing is trying to become a better leader. Now again, if, if, if in this, whatever organization, what you have to do is, is do something that you don't agree with and it's, it's the wrong thing to do and you do it anyways, we'll then, then that's, that's, that's, that's almost a totally different thing. There's that. Then there's, hey, I'm going to kiss ass so that I get promoted. It's all about me and that's probably the what we think of the definition of a fake person. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:41:02       Okay. Next question.

Speaker 3:          00:41:09       I saw a weakness in you on your latest podcast. You seem to overlook the fact that some infant children were raised in undisciplined environments with undisciplined parents. They grew up having modeled these undisciplined examples. I hate the fact that I have growth, undisciplined behavior solving this is a major priority in my life. You have zero of what it,

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       of what this experience is like for me. You seem blind to this struggle, like a father who would ignore their child struggle and offer only the words man up. So this is a good question and I see where this guy's coming from for sure. And I know that it can be very, very frustrating to try and become disciplined.

Speaker 5:          00:42:02       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:42:03       And I apologize that I haven't talked about the fact of of what to do if you come from an undisciplined family or you have on disciplined parents. I haven't really talked about what to do in that situation, but there's a reason that I haven't talked about that before. And that is because you don't get disciplined from your parents. You don't get disciplined from your parents, from your grandparents, from your older brothers and sisters. You don't get disciplined from an external source. You have to get it from you. That's what self discipline is. You get it from yourself, you get it from you. So here's people from every possible background, from no parents to crazy parents too, you know, drug addicted parents to super squared away parents and everywhere in between on that spectrum that are completely disciplined people more disciplined than anyone I know. It doesn't come from your parents, you don't inherit it. And there's another piece here.

Speaker 1:          00:43:18       It's called ownership, right? It's called ownership. And if you're, if you want to blame other people for the problem, and I say this all the time, if you don't take ownership of the problem, the problem's not going to get salt. So if you blame your parents for not having raised you in a discipline environment, you're not going to solve that problem. You're looking at your parents. And if you would've done a better job being more disciplined for me, I would be more disciplined now. So that means that means you can't do anything. The fact of the matter is, it's wrong. You actually can do something and it doesn't matter what, how your parents raised you and brought you up. You can have the discipline you need to decide to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:44:00       So as long as you're blaming other people, I mean, even if you blame me for not discussing it, you blame me for having zero idea what that experience is like. You blame your parents for not raising you this way. As long as you're blaming other people, as long as you're counting on other people to give you discipline, as long as you do that, you will not have it. So again, I, I'm sorry I should've made that. I should make that more clearly and I'm trying to make it more clearly now. And like my parents, my parents are good people. They had successful as, as educators in public schools. And my mom eventually became a, went into school administration and my dad taught in high school for 30 something years and they were good, hardworking people. And I'll tell you, they were no, they were no extraordinary preachers of discipline. And I'll tell you, I, I in fact, I,

Speaker 1:          00:44:57       I never remember either one of them ever using the term or referring to discipline in any way. Um, you know, and actually both my parents worked, they both worked a lot. My Dad was coaching sports and we'll do an afterschool stuff. My mom, same thing, like we were on our own a bunch. Well my parents were gone in the morning. We got ourselves to school when we got home in the afternoon. They weren't home. Uh, you know, so it wasn't like they were setting up this rigid disciplined manner for me. Right. Yeah. And um, and you can see this with families, many, many different families. There's families that have kids that the parents are very disciplined and the kids are wild and out of control sometimes it problematically, so, right. Kids that come from really good families, but they get addicted to drugs, lack of discipline. Kids that come from really good families, but they, they spin out of control and, and going the wrong direction. And there's also the opposite, which is pay. The parents weren't around or the parents were abusive or the parents were drug addicts and all of a sudden the kid, the kid comes out of that and then is squared away is awesome. And we saw that all the time in the seal teams. And I've said that before on this program doesn't matter. It doesn't matter where your background is, it is what you decide to do. Yeah. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:46:17       and I'll tell you another thing, it's not even from the military, like the military requires discipline obviously, but there's plenty of people in the military that don't have it right. And, and many poor, many people lose their discipline when they leave the mulch because it's not being imposed on them anymore. So, I mean, just go look around. I mean, being in the military does not make you a discipline person. Being from a discipline family does not make you a discipline person. Being in a discipline group does not make you a discipline person. What makes you disciplined person is choosing to be disciplined. So

Speaker 1:          00:46:57       yeah, I, I, and, and also as far as telling people to man up, um, which, you know, when someone says, how do I get up early every day, I say, get up early every day. How do I stop eating sugar? Stop eating sugar if that's the definition of man up. But obviously is not just men that need discipline in their life. I don't think I use that term, but what I do tell people is to get after it. That's what I tell people to get after it. I tell people to do the things that they know they're supposed to do, right? There's things that you know you're supposed to do as a human being. Things that you know are gonna Improve Your Life. Do those things. There's things that you know are going to make you a worse person and make your life worse. Don't do those things. Don't do the things that are making you weaker. Start doing the things that are going to make you stronger and smarter and faster and healthier and get to make you a better human being. And I'll say the same thing to this guy.

Speaker 4:          00:47:54       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:47:55       you want to be more disciplined. Get after it. That's it, man. Get up early. Do some kind of workout. Eat good foods, clean your room, make a list of things that you're supposed to do in your life, and then wake up in the morning and do those things that you put on the list. That's what discipline is and no, it is not easy, but you're not going to get it from anyone else but you

Speaker 2:          00:48:21       and it's worth it. And it is the thing that is going to bring you freedom. That's the key word right there. When you said it's worth it. You know what, I think this is what I think. I think like in an environment as like how he put it, an undisciplined environment or aunt or something like that where he grew up in an undisciplined environment. I don't, obviously that's a very vague

Speaker 2:          00:48:49       expression, right? Undisciplined environment. I mean that can mean a lot of different things. So a lot of times like when you're brought up in a certain environment, basically you're kind of taught or, or not taught, like, like the value of certain things. So if you use like, I don't know, working out or whatever. Right. So I'm going to use myself as an, as an example. My Dad was an athlete, um, you know, not a superior athlete, but he was, you know, he, he knew like working out was a part of life and stuff like that. And you know, in elementary school were doing sports and stuff like that. You know, some people, they don't do that at all. So when they grow up into adulthood that some people straight up have never worked out before, never been in a gym and you know, so growing up they were never taught the value of what working out does for you.

Speaker 2:          00:49:41       They never taught. So they can't appreciate it. They just simply don't know the value share or they see people with, you know, you know, they're in shape or they can do these things and they're very functioning, whatever they see that of course, but they don't have that value. They don't feel that value. They just never learned it. So it, it can come off as like this thing for other people, you know, like well that's what other people do kind of thing. So they don't understand the value. So back to the point in their mind, this weird, the connection is not made that it's worth it because they don't know the value of it really. But if you do know the value of it and then you can decide, okay, is this worth it, is it worth it to wake up every day and in quote unquote get after it for this particular goal or this particular set of goals. So that's what it is. And I think sure the undisciplined environment

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       can maybe provide that. But I think you're right. I think that once you're like, oh yeah that's worth it, you know, help people, they'll find reasons when it's worth it. Even though they've never expect like, you know, like a person who has a heart attack or something, it's like, and they have kids or young kids or something, they have a heart attack, maybe never worked out ever in their life. They have a heart attack, they almost died. They're like guess what? I'm working out every single day. I'm a vegetarian now. You know like doing major, major changes that they've never even thought about making. And they'll do it because they decided it's worth it and they'll be discipline. They'll find that discipline real quick, no matter how they were trained as you know, their environment and their cause. Now I see that it's going to be worth it.

Speaker 3:          00:51:05       That's it. Yeah. And if, if it's not worth it to use, and that I think is what you develop, the value of working out, the value of you develop, you can develop that from anywhere. That's what I'm saying. That's essentially, that's part of the early develop that from any, any, you can develop that from, from anywhere. Yeah. You can get it from parents who can get it from, yeah, exactly. Right, exactly right. But the discipline itself, just like I said, that's going to come from you. Your parents can teach it, but guess who has to the, it's still you. It's still you. And you can go to the military to specifically learn discipline when you leave, it's on you. Who's it? Yeah, exactly. Right. And just like I said, like yeah, I know people who are done with the military and are glad they're done with that. They're glad with this waking up early. They're next monster out of shape. They're not doing anything productive. It's, it's horrible to say, but it happens. Happens with the military. It happens with anything. Yeah. It was when kids get out of high school sports, you know, and all of a sudden they don't want, I don't have to do that anymore. I don't have to listen to coach. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:52:10       Crazy. Don't listen to coach. Listen to yourself yourself. Yeah. Determine whether or not it's worth it. And I'm telling you do, you don't need to determine, I'm telling you it's worth it. Oh yeah. I'm telling you it is worth it. And you know what? You actually know it's worth it. That's why you're asking this question. You know it's worth it. You know what's worth it to have discipline. But you think there's an easier way. You think that it's something that people have. You think that when Jockos alarm clock goes off, it's like, oh, just like my father taught me, I rise and I shine. You know what I'm like, no, I, it's like the pillow feel soft and comfortable and the alarm clock is banging on my head and I don't like it. But you know what, I know it's worth it to get up and get after it.

Speaker 3:          00:52:50       I know it's worth it and you know it's worth it. Here's the thing though, we all know what's worse is in in a way you're right, but like really though really I'm going to be open, open and honest with you. I don't think that that people know it's worth it. I think they know it's worth it. Like the kind of on paper, they have a multiple choice question, is it worth it? Yes or no? There'll be like, yes. Obviously I know working out is worth it. But here's the thing. I don't if you don't know, if you don't like like having good credit for example. So I never got taught like why really? My Mom said, yeah, you should have good credit. That's it. That's the limit to my education on credit. Right. So of course they're below it because they get, you know, I fall for literally all the tricks if self-inflicted and otherwise credit gets jammed up.

Speaker 3:          00:53:36       So, so I don't know. I don't know the value. I don't know. I've never experienced the benefits of having good car. I don't know the value of good credit. So it really didn't mean much to me. Really. My credit was like junk and I didn't care until I got denied for something then I cared. You know. But just like if you're never into working out until you're in a specific situation where shows, but like this guy that's asking this question and glad he's asking the question, I'm, I'm not, I'm trying, I'm not trying to come off all hard. Um, but he realizes she realizes the value of discipline. Cause he's saying that he wants it. Right. He knows that it's going to make his life better. Yeah. And, and that's why I think he, he's gotten jammed up in whatever way. We don't know, cause I don't know, maybe he's gotten unhealthy.

Speaker 3:          00:54:22       Maybe he's, you know, who knows, maybe he's gotten his finances jammed up, whatever the case may be. He knows that discipline is better for them. Him, he knows that. He does know this isn't a guy that doesn't know yet. Cause sure there's people that don't, you know, when you're 16 years old, you don't know the value of discipline. You don't know that the, what you're, the way you're acting right now, it's gonna affect you in five years. You don't know that you can set yourself your whole life up to be pretty awesome. Yeah. You don't know that yet. You're just like worried about where you're going on a Friday night. Right. So this guy knows and he wants it and he's looking for where he can find it and where he can find it is in the mirror. Yeah. That's where it is, you know, so do it brother.

Speaker 3:          00:55:05       Good luck. Get on the path and stay on the path. Yeah. And that's going to be beneficial when you do the harshly. Maintaining that, like not knowing the value is a big is a big thing. It's kind of like, okay. So back to my credit thing, there is a point at the end where, okay, so, um, you know, like, uh, I dunno, 10 years ago, whatever, I repaired my credit, my credit was repaired, I went through it was painstaking, not fun stuff. Yeah. But I did it. Got To credit repaired and now I know the value because as an adult I'm functioning. It's useful now, you know? So now I know the value of having good credit because I've been through all the things that having good credit brings you through, you know? Now I'm thinking I'll never go back to bed crying. Never. It's worth it every single day.

Speaker 3:          00:55:53       I'm telling you that I agree with what you're saying. Yeah. I agree with what you're saying. I'm saying that this guy knows the value and that's why he wants it. Yeah. It's like when you realize that you got denied for something and you're like, oh, vow credit has value. I understand that something happened in his life where he said discipline has value. I know that now. But you did credit repair and in what you said was, okay, I need to go out and repair my credit. You didn't say, Hey, you know what? My mom didn't tell me about bad credit and now I have bad credit. Yeah. Yeah. So

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       now, so now what am I supposed to do? You know who repaired your credit, who repaired your credit? Well it was a combination of my wife and I but, but who repaired your credit? It yeah, we did this stuff. You took responsibility for it and said, okay, I'm gonna get my credit card. You, you talked to your wife because she's smarter than you. And she was like, Hey I will, I will help this. But it was you that said, okay I got to get this fixed and you got help. But you knew to reach out for help, but you're the one that ultimately is responsible for it. Yeah, you're right about that. Like I didn't like I didn't blame my parents and then continue having that credit. Right. Like you said, no I gotta get this, this thing has credit, has value, I need to fix it. And you fixed it, you know, regardless of where it came from regardless.

Speaker 1:          00:57:10       So w w w w you know, oh you don't know how to work out. Cool. Then you go hire a personal trainer cause you know it's going to, it's the right thing to do. You know what I mean? Oh, you don't know how to repair your finances. Cool. Go get a counselor that's going to help you repair your finances. Oh, you're addicted to drugs or alcohol. Okay, I'm going to go find a counselor or join a group so I can get through that thing. No one's going to hold your hand and bring you into that. Any of those situations, you've got to do it yourself. You've gotta have the discipline to make it happen. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:57:39       Good.

Speaker 1:          00:57:42       Ah, number seven. Good morning.

Speaker 1:          00:57:49       Did you find that people in the military mock those that emphasize the importance of good leadership, who take leading and our responsibilities seriously? What does that mean? Mocking like the front of you? Yeah. Like what? People in the military making, making fun of you because you take leadership super seriously. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like you're this way scout. This is an interesting question, so it makes me a little bit nervous because my suspicion is that this individual might be going about being a good leader the wrong way, and if you go about it the wrong way, people can take offense to it. If you're the guy that goes around telling everyone that you are a leader and you're trying to be great leader, people would take offense to that because like you can't make that part of your thing, right. People that talk about the importance of good leadership are they come across as implying that they are good leader and and that can be offensive, especially if you aren't quite as good of a leader as you think you are. She run around like you don't understand how important leadership is. Like just think about that statement right there. You don't understand the importance of leadership. Echo. I'll all of a sudden I'm basically telling you like I'm a good leader and you're not. When the reality is just the way I'm talking proves that I'm not a good leader because I'm talking down to you. Yeah, so we have a problem right there. And also if, if you take leading and our leading responsibilities, what does that actually mean?

Speaker 1:          00:59:24       Does that mean that you can't have any fun with your team? Does that mean you can't laugh at yourself when you've made a mistake? Does that mean that you are trying so hard to give off the impression that you are a great leader, that it appears to everyone else that you aren't really who you act like and that your character is, is disingenuous. Right? If I'm, if I'm constantly trying to put up this front that I'm the great leader, everyone starts looking at me thinking that guy's not even, that's not, that's not the real him. He's just trying to rock around like, uh, like a, he's not true. Right? You think about it, you're trying to build trust and as a leader we are trying to build trust. We talked to dick winters talking about honesty being the most, one of the most important traits of a, of a leader. But if we're putting up a facade and how we act, that does not come across as honest and that doesn't build trust. In fact, they build the opposite.

Speaker 4:          01:00:23       And

Speaker 1:          01:00:26       also if, if, if you have to put up a leadership front,

Speaker 4:          01:00:31       hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:00:33       If you have to put up a leadership front. In other words, if sometimes you have to act a certain way, fake it. Going back to something earlier, if you have to act and fake like a leader, that means you might be, you might be insecure about your leadership capability and you will come across as insecure and people can sense that insecurity. So that can be very problematic. Also, if you're so into being a good leader, that probably means that you have issues giving up the reins. That means that you are probably micromanaging because you want to be a leader. Do you want to prove to everyone that you're a good leader and so you start micromanaging and no one wants to follow a micromanager. They don't want to do that. And if you add all these things together, what do people end up doing? They end up mocking. You may end up mocking the things that you think are important, like leadership itself. They start to make fun of it.

Speaker 4:          01:01:43       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:01:45       it's, Oh man, the, it's like the needle. I think his name is needle Meyer in animal house, isn't it the right name? I don't know. I kind of, I'm doing a movie reference and you're not in with me. This is messed up. I can give you the John Belushi. That's all you know. So there's, it's like the leader, the the ROTC guy. He's the guy that's like Mr leader and everyone makes fun of him. Yeah, he's trying to be a great leader. He's trying to be the authoritative figure. Everyone is making fun of him. So you have to be careful in case I would recommend you move to the center a little bit more. Meaning that on the one hand you have a leader that isn't building relationship, isn't building trust, expects people to do as they're told and and treat, treat that leader with respect to, even though they haven't earned it, that's not a good leader. On the other hand, you have leaders that are too close with the troops, has very personal relationships to personal relationships with the team and has lost any semblance of authority over the team. So there's your two extremes. You want to be balanced in the middle. You want to build relationships with the people you want to build your team up. And also forcing leadership on to people does not work any more than forcing a religion or a diet or a workout or a political breathe belief system.

Speaker 1:          01:03:09       And can you make someone from a, from a leadership perspective, if you have a 40 over other people, can you make someone bow down to your program mechanically for a little while?

Speaker 4:          01:03:20       Yeah, you can. You can. But

Speaker 1:          01:03:25       if it's not from them, if they're not part of it willfully, it's not going to work over time. So, you know, don't beat people up verbally with your leadership lessons.

Speaker 4:          01:03:40       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:03:42       Don't make it your external religion that you are forcing on people internally. Yes, of course. Obviously Ma, I always thought about leadership. I always thought about leadership, but I wasn't barking it. And I don't, I don't even think, I don't even think

Speaker 1:          01:04:05       like my best. The people that taught me the most about leadership, they never said a word to me about leadership. Right. And I'm not saying that that's the best course of action because, because sometimes it is good to, you know, pull someone aside and say, Hey, this is the way you're acting right now in front of your troops and that that's not going to be effective. Sometimes that is good. Yeah. Especially once you've built the relationship. Because if I don't have a relationship with you, echo, when I say, Hey, I need to talk to you. Hey, the way you're treating your guys right now isn't going to go over very well with them. What's your reaction going to be? You're going to be pissed. You're gonna think of you don't know my guys. I know them better than unit. We're going to have a problem. I D I. D I accomplished nothing. My coaching and mentoring of you was horrible cause we didn't have a relationship. So you're not listening. And obviously of course when I started coaching and mentoring, that implies that I'm the greatest leader of all time. That's my, that's the implied statement and you suck on great. Which people reject that as well, especially when you're not that great of a leader in the first place. So don't talk about it so much. Just lead, be a good leader, open up discussions,

Speaker 1:          01:05:11       take a wrap off, come from the flank instead of going straight on maneuver

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       tactically and tactfully get into their heads and make better leaders by actually leading.

Speaker 4:          01:05:28       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:05:30       Yes. Of like that lead, you know, lead by example kind of thing. It kind of makes you like the question kind of how you said at the beginning, it makes you wonder. He says, the question is do you find that people in the military mock those that emphasize the importance of good leadership? You kind of think to yourself, I wonder how this person is emphasizing the importance of good. Is he the guy at the party who, you know, people were talking about, I don't know that the food or something. Then he just bust out leadership stuff. You know that guy who's like everything on like ROTC guy.

Speaker 3:          01:06:05       He's just pushing it everyday. You know, leadership has everything leaves you. If everything are bright. We weren't even talking about that. Leadership is everything kind of thing. By the way, this is coming from a person in me that I literally talk about leadership at the time. Yeah. And, and I actually think that way. And I, I get up on stage and in companies and in front of military members and police officers and, and I talk about leadership. That's what I talk about all the time. Yeah. And that's what, you know what's interesting, that's what makes about face by Colonel David Hackworth. The, one of the best things about that book is it's not a leadership book. He doesn't, he just talk. He barely talks about, he barely says a straightforward sentences and use it. This is how you lead. It's all from the flank. And that's why it gets you so well because it's from the flank.

Speaker 3:          01:06:55       Yeah. It's not a book about leadership doesn't even say it. Right. You know how many books get published publish all the time. You know that this is a leadership book. I wrote a book with life. How to lead and win. Yeah. Hackworth did it better Hackworth like, oh, this is about war. Read it. Yeah. Yeah. In a way a day. I think we've seen. But obviously that's your job. So I guess my point is that if you're, if this is coming from someone who talks about leadership all the time, literally wrote a book about leadership. Yeah. And I'm saying, Hey, you might not want to talk about that. That's my point. That's my point. Yeah. Good point. Just just, just back off a little bit. Yeah. So if you were like, you know, you go on the road, you do one a year, you know, with your deals and then you know, at dinner with your family, you start going into your leadership stuff with them.

Speaker 3:          01:07:50       That's what you shouldn't hear. Yes, yes. But I'm, what I'm saying is with your team, with your platoon, you don't sit there and say, all right, today we're going to talk about leadership again. Yeah. You don't quote unquote emphasize the importance of good leadership. Right. You demonstrate it. You just lead. They're smarter than you think. They're, you know what you're in to do and you're kind of condescending. Yeah. You help it cause you're treating them like they don't know. You want to talk about the importance of leaders if they know what the importance of leadership there in the military. Yeah. In fact, an example of their reaction of how people take it. When you start preaching to them, you know how they take it, they mock you. That's a lesson learned. That's a lesson learned. If people are mocking you, they're not taking you seriously.

Speaker 3:          01:08:37       Yeah. That means you're doing something wrong. What you're doing wrong in this case is your condescendingly talking to them about the importance of leadership. They know what the importance of leadership is. Yeah. They're in the military. They know how bad it is to have a bad platoon sergeant or a bad platoon, a platoon commander. They know you don't need to rub it in their face. Yeah, I remember, I think I told you the story about one of my friends, I'm not gonna name the name cause I'm certain, you know he's a navy seal. We were at a party and he got, he got drunk and he's sitting at the table explaining to all of us how bad ass navy seals are. Yeah. Like for a long time too. This is the, and he even said those words, maybe you still just so bad ass, like we're so bad at and this is why and all this stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:09:21       And it's the exact same thing because we know navy seals are bad ass, but you sitting here telling us how bad ass you and all navy seals are is going to make us mock you a little bit. Going to get mocked. Yeah. Even a little bit. You're gonna get mocked a lot. You're going to get mocked by other navy seals, by the way. For sure. Doing that stuff. Anyway, check. Well, I'm glad that this guy is asking the question. I'm glad that the guy is focused on leadership and I hope that these points can come across and be digested with no. Um, you know, there's real easy to get offended by what I'm saying, right. If you're him, you like, well, you just doesn't get it. You know what I mean? It's real easy to say that. Yeah. We used to do yo, Yo, it's easy for him to say he doesn't know what he's talking about. I'm the one that's here. I'm trying to get these guys to be better. You know, I'm trying to get my book too, and understand the importance of leadership. I know, man. I know, and I respect that. I liked the fact that you're have that mindset, man. That's all true. That's awesome. That's awesome. Come from the flag a little bit. Come from the flank, man. You're not gonna. You're not gonna. You're not gonna get that. Get it done this way. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:10:26       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:10:28       It's Kinda like if you try to convince everyone that you're the most humble person in the world, you know, nobody more humbling me. I'm the most humble. I'm humbler than that guy. I'm a humbling then you, I'm home earlier than anyone through that who've ever lived. I'm just the most humble guy in the world. Just doesn't work like that. That doesn't work that well. X question, Jocko. How do you lead a team of volunteers? How to punish or discipline them? Can't threaten to fire them because they're all I have. I know a leader does so much more than threatened and punish, but I need some guidance. Try to motive, try to motivate but feel the need to do more things. Trying to answer this one quickly once, cause this is kind of a,

Speaker 1:          01:11:13       a question I've answered before in a different form. Um, do they understand why they're doing what they're doing and do they understand why it's important? Do they understand how what they are doing will benefit them? Do they also see you working hard to try and make things happen? So those are, those are just the basic questions. Let's just get those out there every time. Every time someone's not doing what you want them to do. Do they understand why they're doing what they're doing? Do they understand why it's important to the mission and do they understand how being successful in the mission and will benefit them? So, so let's just get those out of the way. Next. What can we do here? Have you game a five the situation at all? How do you like that gamified, right? Have you gamified the situation? Cause I realize that's a term that's getting thrown around now, but we would gamify stupid things all the time in the seal teams to make them fun.

Speaker 1:          01:12:02       Right. How much brass can you pick up? Let's see. I'll pick up more than you. My squad will pick up more breasts and you'll pick up all of the sudden we were running around the range trying to pick up brass. One of the most miserable things that you have to do in the seal teams is pickup brass off the hot range and the summertime. And you do it for, for like two days. Because once you get done with all your work, you've got to go pick up millions of rounds of brass spread out all over the Desert Inn in August in the imperial valley. It's odd. It's socks. But guess what? We're going to do, have a contest know. So what are you going to do to game a fight? Uh, like what kind of cool competition around some short term goal can you set up that's going to be, it's going to make it fun for them.

Speaker 1:          01:12:42       Some kind of cool reward. What about some kind of friendly bets around achieving something like I bet if I raise this much money, you know, I will go to work with a pair of underwear on my head or you have to, you know what I mean? Whatever these stupid bets, you know what we used to do in the teams is we'd bet $1, one of my old running mates, we, we, we had something like critical, I bet you $1. Yeah. That was like the biggest bet you could make because it's just, it's pure pride. So, you know, and then we'd, we'd always have fun if you are collecting or if you're giving the dollar collecting the dollar was just totally glorious. Giving the dollar was shame and shame. So yeah, like you could add like, okay, when you give me this dollar a, it has to be in front of everybody, be you have to, I don't know, you have to do it well like walking on your knees or something.

Speaker 1:          01:13:32       Something to real, kind of demeaning. But we didn't even have to do all that. Just give me and my resume if we won or lost the bet and is like, you know, and, and you wouldn't even ask for the money. You just look at them. And this buddy of mine, he had of the most classic looks when he'd give you the look, when I lose a bet to me, he gave me the look, I wanted to cry. He lost more than that. So maybe you make a bet for a dollar and if that's not working, okay now if that's not working, if you can't game a five, if you can't have fun with it, maybe ask them while they're, why they are there and figure out their motivation is for being there and how you can tie that into something concrete. And then also like you might have some people at heart aren't really into this and then lower your expectations of this particular group of people and gaunt recruits and people that want to get after it.

Speaker 4:          01:14:29       Makes Sense. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:14:33       Have some fun. Fun goes along way. Fun goes a long way. Having fun doing things goes a long way.

Speaker 2:          01:14:40       And the, and that praise thing too. You know, when you said like add like a reward or something for, because a lot of times, especially volunteers were so, you know, and we all feel this, like even at work you can have like a super fun job, but you'll get, you'll people genital spe speaking tend to get complacent in one way or another. You know, when things are routine or things are, you know, not as exciting or whatever. Um, and you know, when you're volunteering and that happens, it's kind of like you're not tied there by a paycheck really, you know, which is just, it's just a powerful tie, you know, that people have to work. It's like, yeah, I don't like my job, but it pays the bills and paying the bills. It's a big deal kind of thing. So if you add that element of excitement or fun or you know, little personal payoff in one way or another, I think that helps a lot of the time.

Speaker 2:          01:15:23       Indeed. And that tends to happen too. If the, if the Li, I'm not saying this person is doing this or not doing this, but like if they become kind of complacent and not recognizing how much they, they, they appreciate the volunteers, you know? Like if they're just like, oh yeah, this is just business as usual, you know, thanks for coming in. That's kind of it kind of thing. And they, you know, then it just gets kind of kind of Blah, you know, like that there's not the payoff that they used to have, you know? But if you can kind of keep that going, keep them in the game.

Speaker 4:          01:15:53       Next question.

Speaker 2:          01:15:55       Do I need to keep training Jujitsu? If I hate it? I mean, can I just live my life the way I think it should be, which is of health energy and become becoming a force of nature as a doctor without dreaming up, have some invisible enemies on the street that I've yet to come across in preparing and spending my pittance of wage of a wage on lessons that I hate in every sorts of ways for something that might be avoided. Physical clash if I learnt to use wit and saving my money to move into a good neighborhood and I've been successful in preventing physical clashes to occur. I've learnt basic ways to escape the amount I can run. I'm fairly strong. Isn't that enough?

Speaker 1:          01:16:38       Okay. So yeah, bro Do. Jesse was not the meaning of life. All right. And you did. Who has a lot of, I mean, I find Jujitsu very enjoyable. I get a lot out of it. Beyond physical training. Beyond self defense. Yeah. I get a lot out of it and I apply it in all different sorts of realms in my life. But if you hate it

Speaker 1:          01:17:06       and, and you've learned some basic ways to defend yourself, escape them out, maybe some basic guards type stuff then, then okay. I mean then step away. I mean, you shouldn't be going through life doing something that you hate. I, if I were you, I'd still train occasionally, even if it's just like once every two or three weeks, once a month, just to keep some of the ideas fresh. And also also there's always the possibility that will click in your head and you'll realize there's, there's like a magical thing that you could get out of the Jujitsu. Um, and it's kind of like waking up, waking up at four 30 in the morning.

Speaker 1:          01:17:40       That's what time I wake up. And, and first of all, I'm genetically predisposed to sleep less than most people. And for instance, we just had daylight savings time and yeah, and so, and I went to bed, so I sat back my clock and it was, it was like nine 40 at night, so it went from 10 40 when I was going to bed, I set back my clock and now it's nine 40 and I said, I'll call, you know, I'll sleep extra hour. We know what time I woke up, like two 48 and then I laid in bed saying, no, sleep more, sleep more, sleep more. I couldn't do it. So I got out of bed at three 30 but that's, that's me. And, and, and that's, that's just me. And it depends on what your schedule is. It depends on what your genetic makeup is for sleep.

Speaker 1:          01:18:27       And if you work the night shift, then obviously you're working at four 30 in the morning or you're getting off at war of work at four 30 in morning. So this just doesn't work. And I try and put that caveat on pretty much everything that I say, like my workouts to what I eat. Um, everyone's a little bit different and I like what I like and, and I do what I do and it works for me and you can try it then if you come up with something that's better, I'll listen to you. Um, and that's the same with Jujitsu, man. If you hate it, then you know, maybe it's not for you. And, and, and you know what I, what I truly think my true thought. Is it beneficial for you? Yes it is. D should you stop doing everything that you don't like, but just because you don't like it? No. I mean, there's some things that you should press on. Should you get it? Should everyone have a fundamental level of knowledge of Jujitsu? It's very, very beneficial. But if you hate it and, and you've kind of come to that conclusion, then don't do it.

Speaker 4:          01:19:31       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:19:32       And, and, and I think also once you give yourself that out, once you give yourself the out and you're not forcing yourself to do it anymore, it might open up your mind to actually enjoy it and try it and not be miserable about it. Yes. Yeah. That's what actually what I was going to say. It's probably, and I don't know easily this, some people don't like it straight up. My God, I accept that. I know. I know. But that being said, there is a possibility that the environment that

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       this person worked, that people train in. Sometimes we'll make you not like it and it's not necessarily the Jujitsu you don't like. Sure. Not wound up that way. You don't like to do anymore because you were kind of, you know, pushed in the wrong direction as far as like what you do like and don't like. So you could try a different school, try different, try different school. Yeah. Like I said earlier today, some schools are really strict and rigid and maybe that's, but would be better for you. Some schools are real wild and there's no control. Maybe that, that be a better school depending on what your personality is. Uh, some people like that regimen and environment. Yeah. Yeah, you could, you could definitely try a different school. Uh, but again, I think, I think the mental hurdle to come over is you've told yourself that you have to do it and now tell yourself you don't have to do if you don't want to, but certain in, and you say try different school.

Speaker 3:          01:20:53       It's the environment that you train in. So the school is part of the environment for sure. But it's like trading partners. It's like the, which can wind up as the pressure you put on yourself. It's like everything, you know, the whole environment. So I know that. And people are different people. Some people, they want that pressure. They want people yelling and you don't like, remember I used to tell you like when you start coaching, either me just in training, you know like you'll get fired up when you see two people training and whatever and you'll be like, do this, do that. And you'll start code. It's almost like you're like as a friend, you're doing it just for fun and you're like, okay, do this. And you usually coach up the other guy when I'm rolling with him and that other guy, oh he's getting coached by Jocko.

Speaker 3:          01:21:33       So he turns up the heat and I don't like that because it's now it's like a thing, you know, I don't like that at all. But some people do like that. Some people that get them fired up, it gets them more in the game, you know? So to, I'm saying people are different. So the possibility is that this guy happens to be in the wrong environment for Jujitsu first for hip, for Jiu Jitsu. For himself. Yes, exactly. So it was a possibility. And just like you said, you know, he, he could very well be putting that pressure on himself. Like you have to go and everyone's saying how great it is and it's the best thing. And if you don't show up to practice, you're whack and you're lame or get on the texture. If you get told all the time it's the best thing in the world.

Speaker 3:          01:22:12       And then you show up there and you get beat up, which is what happens and now you're like, how does everyone likes this? This doesn't feel good to me. And you just go in a negative mindset right away. So you guys should be careful of that. And that's not dimension. When you even imply that you don't necessarily like it. Oh yeah, cause you suck. Oh yeah, because you're this or you're weak or you're whatever. You're a slacker. Like basically all this negativity, you know, it's going to turn you off even more so now. Yeah. You paid it now, which, which there's the reality of it is some, some things don't agree with some people, right? That's, that's a reality. Like there's some things in the world that, that I don't, I know, I just don't like them. Like when we were driving to La, you're playing some music. Some of the music that you're playing is, is popular music. I just don't like it. I just don't like it. And

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       there's other things like that in the world. I'm trying to think of things that I just, just like other people like them. Yeah. And I just don't like them. I just don't Pokemon go. That's one thing. Yeah. I mean, I don't, I've never even thought about Pokemon go. It seems like a cool idea. You got, you look for things on your phone. I mean, well, I'm not, that's not the type of thing that I'm talking about. Um, you know, I guess dancing at the club. No, I mean, I don't care about, I'm trying to think of something that's, um, I guess music is the best is one of the best examples for me is, is, you know, hey, this certain types of music, certain artists, yeah. Like Lafe, Lafe likes hair. Lafe likes hair metal from the 90s he legit likes it. And, and I, I like legit do not like it.

Speaker 1:          01:23:54       And the reason I used the reason that's a good example is because that's not far off from kind of the music that I do like. I mean I like, I like led Zeppelin, I love led Zeppelin, right. Led Zeppelin's awesome. And, and the step from led Zeppelin to, to, to poison. I mean you could, you could be in the same record category in the store, right? Rock and roll led Zeppelin. I love, yeah, I poison kind of turns my stomach. I hate it. And so that's an example of some things they just don't sit well with you and, and maybe Jujitsu doesn't sit well with this guy. Now I'm, like I said, I think there's a lot of benefits to it. I think you get a lot out of it. Try a different environment. But if you hate it, don't force yourself to do it.

Speaker 1:          01:24:42       Open. Open the escape, right. Give yourself an out and that allows you to feel more comfortable. Cause when you feel trapped, everyone feels like a cornered animal and now you're just pissed off you. If you, if you've been like, hey these guys, everyone, I hear everyone talking about Jujitsu so I'm going to try it and now your first day you don't like it, but you're like, I'm going to keep doing it because everyone is saying that's great and you just ended up in a bad way. So be careful with that one. You're kinda trapped it with it, with the junk parts of it. Yeah. That, that kind of came about and yeah, and you can't really escape it then you're like rebel against it.

Speaker 1:          01:25:18       Yeah. Remember when we were driving up to la? I was playing carry by Europe. That is actually technically an eighties hair metal. Yeah. That's an easy yeah, for sure. But you were really mad. Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm telling you that music doesn't sit well with me for some reason. You got little bitty going back to life, like lay likes Metallica. Lafe likes black sabbath lay flags tool. He likes rocking bands too. For some reason. There's some genetic code in his head that poisons cool. Yeah. Just lets it right in my and gets the, and Holt. Yeah. But then I guess on the other end of the spectrum you'd get, we get into music that leaf and light, like life likes Pantera. Pantera was a hard band. Now I go one step further than Penn. Tara. Right. Some of the music that I listen to him, uh, which I

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       think leaves Lafe a little bit where he wouldn't listen to some of the harder music that I listen to. But pantyhose, you know, brushing up against it. Hey, do you listen to soft music? Come on. What do you consider soft music? I Dunno. Something about love songs. I don't know. So you don't let something soft, do you know what I'm saying? I'd say White Buffalo, White Buffalo is hard acoustic music. But you know, he's got some pretty mellow songs. He got a song called love song number one. What's it about though? Like is he, is it like romantic, you know, is he talked to you about the girl or something like that? I would say yes. Yeah, he kinda did the count cause it's, you know, how like what, how can that not count? No. Because you know how like, like a Metallica for example, they have unforgiven.

Speaker 3:          01:26:46       Right. So it sounds softer, but they're still talking about hard stuff. Okay. And then they have like interst hand man, which is what I guess I'm just not, no my answer to use. No. Like do you like what about led Zeppelin by one sec, you're still talking about like, these are soft things, like, you know, okay. So I'll play an Algebra. Remember? Remember Algebra? And you're like, what the off this and you're pissed. You are mad at me personally. Like you and you were like, who is this? No, no, no. You know what though? Actually I played another song. Uh, who was it? He was like Josh in or something. And you're like, Hey, this is pretty good. I was very surprised. It was a soft song. Do you remember? That's my musical. Tastes are varied. Yeah. Different types of music. Yeah. So I guess some types of music that I don't like.

Speaker 3:          01:27:36       Yeah. I sometimes wonder with you, like if you're the kind of, you know how some people, they just, just, I like music. I'm not saying me, I'm just saying certain people they are into just a specific type of music. That's it. That's the whole reason for music in their head is like this very specific feeling. Like some people, um, that I had know before they, they only like house music. They don't like anything other than the house. Music is like, it's just the old rather listen to nothing. So I was wondering if you were like kind of that kind of no where it's just all different kinds of music. Yeah. Well at least just not, maybe not all different. Yeah. Okay. You're right. I listened to a wide various types. Sure. There you go. Not Algebra though. I forget the song, but it was who we can refer back to it later some other time. Cool. All right. Next question. How about that? Dang. I kind of feel bad for the guy who hates you. Do too. That's kind of crazy. Yeah, it's a bummer, but it's, it's not that rare. Yeah, it makes sense. It totally makes sense. I was actually talking with Dave real sure. I know who that is. I don't know him personally. Well I was up with him up in San Francisco area yesterday and we were talking about how some people don't like Jujitsu and you'd think even people that are you would think would like to Jitsu people

Speaker 1:          01:29:01       that have jobs that Jujitsu would be really beneficial for them to know. They don't like Jujitsu. Yeah. And so, and I was saying that I've introduced a lot of people to Jujitsu, a lot of people to Jujitsu. Not many of them have actually stuck with it for a long period of time and, and so it's not that rare for people to not like Jujitsu. Yeah. And I, I dig, it's like not sticking with it. Cause did you do that? Takes work. It's not like the easy thing that provides discipline is a difference between not like in Jujitsu and not actually sticking with it. Yes. This guy straight up. I hate it. That's a little bit more powerful statement. Yeah. It's like definitely doesn't like people who don't stick with it for the most part, this is just a total guess on my part or lazy and lack discipline. Yeah. Like they, they just,

Speaker 2:          01:29:51       they, they, they don't like it enough on an, on a kind of moment to moment basis to get off the couch and go. That's kind of, you know, it's one of those situations. Next question Jocko. I have a question after reading your book, which I thought was one of the best books I've read since your last book. Nice. I'm curious what, what you did during your seal team days to maintain your, your schedule as I would imagine in the teams, your schedule changes at any minute to include you being deployed or active during your various missions at night. So as in life, how do you keep your balance of your schedule when duty calls in your book, you say keep your schedule, but how did you work through this when you would be on a mission that didn't allow you to sleep at night? Did you still, did you still the following day upon return, maintain your normal schedule, appreciate your time and response. Great.

Speaker 1:          01:30:51       Yeah. Obviously the teams that you're scheduling the teams can vary a lot and you have to adopt to what makes sense. And sometimes in the teams you're working 18, 20 hour days. Sometimes out in the field you're going in the field for two, three, four, five days at a time. Sometimes you're working for 24 hours a day or you work for 36 hours straight because you do planning in the blah, blah, blah. So that can be wrong. But sometimes you're doing dives, you're doing two dives a day and that takes a bunch of time and it takes a toll on you. It's hard work I guess you could say. Um, sometimes we're running around all day or all night running around the desert, running around the urban training facility. And so the schedule is changing all the time. And it's the same thing with business. The same thing with business.

Speaker 1:          01:31:33       Right now I travel on the flight leaves early in the flight leaves. He doesn't work all day or the dinner with the clients or the interview or the writing or the, the recording of the podcast or the changing time zones and things just change. And so what I do is yes, I try and I try and keep the schedule as much as I can and if I fall off the schedule for whatever reason, I get back off on it as quickly as possible. And I think so. So yes, you do the best you can. I think the main thing you have to watch out for is letting, letting a change in schedule or a problem in your schedule being an excuse to fall off the path. Right? That's what you have to watch out for. Um, you know, we think, oh, I'm in a new time zone or I've got jet lag or I didn't sleep well or I need rest from traveling or I did this the other night and saw I'm going to sleep until nine 30 tomorrow morning and just call it good.

Speaker 1:          01:32:22       That's what you have to watch out for now sometimes. Do you need to work to ninth did you sleep til nine 30 yeah. Sometimes you do. Sometimes you stayed up for 36 hours. You go to bed at three o'clock in the morning, guess what? You might need to sleep until nine 30. That's cool. Good. Do it. Get some sleep. Um, but just be careful of using it as an excuse to go way off the path and just get yourself back on the path as soon as possible. Yeah. Make sense? Yes, sir. Yeah, that's all me right there. Like one little thing on my schedule throws off on this whole day is gone. I'll do it tomorrow. He's got to be careful that, uh, speaking to schedule, I think we're about good for questions. There's one more thing that I wanted to close out with and you know, I get a lot of, I get a lot of really great emails.

Speaker 1:          01:33:13       I will get a lot of great messages through social media, letters, written letters, I get all those kinds of things and I appreciate them all. I don't always respond to all of them because there's, I, I physically cannot do it. Yeah. And of course, you know, oh, get someone to manage your social media or whatever. I'm not doing that. If you hear back from me, you hear it from me, not from somebody that I paid $10 an hour to respond to my stuff and say, cool, get after it. Like no, uh, not doing that. But you know, I get, I would get all these things and I, I do read them. So if you send it, I read it. And so I appreciate the feedback and everything. I got one though that I, that was good. I wanted to actually wanting to read on here because I felt that it not only said, hey, thanks for you know, the podcast or whatever, thanks for the books, whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:34:09       It actually gave some pretty good methodology and really an inset into a mindset that I think will help people doing what they're doing. So here we go. Mr Willick just wanted to share a quick story with you. At 39 I had fallen into a 15 year Rut of undisciplined alcoholism. I was soft and heavy and wanted a change. Earlier this year I had started working out three to four times a week in my basement. I was trying and failing to get a handle on my alcohol abuse. Every failure made the beast seemed bigger and unbeatable. It was like I didn't have control over my body. I finished your book on a Monday night and decided that I would get up early the next morning and workout. I got up and worked out. Not much, but I just wanted to do something. Sit ups, pushups, 15 minutes on the bike, worked out twice, Tuesday, got up Wednesday and did it again. Got To Thursday night on normal drinking night and decided to try not drinking. Made it through Friday. Same thing. Worked out morning and night, stayed busy and stayed away from the drink. Fought I should try and push it through the weekend. Worked out Saturday morning. It took the rest of the weekend, often stayed dry. Monday morning I got up and started two days again, made it through the week with 11 workouts. By the second week, I felt better than I had in my entire life. I was astounded that normal people walked around feeling this good.

Speaker 1:          01:35:58       I guess not systematically poisoning your body will do that.

Speaker 1:          01:36:03       On the fifth week, I got a project at work that was going to require traveling for the next eight weeks. I was worried about overcoming my triggers and road habits, but normal traveling evening was dinner, watch cable and drink eight beers. To my surprise, the hotel at a sweet gym. Cool. I'll just keep doing what I'm doing. Then at the site I found out that weren't, we would start work at 6:00 AM. Damn. That means I have to get up at four to workout. I'm 12 weeks into my traveling. Two a days, usually getting 11 to 12 workouts a week. They recently moved our start time to 7:00 AM so now I get an hour and a half in the morning and evening. I'm 16 weeks clean, dropped 30 pounds or more. I haven't been on a scale in three weeks. 34 waist jeans hanging off of me. I sit up and pushed. Upsets went from 10 to 40 to 50 kettlebell swings went from 35 by 10 to 50 by 15 I started to learn how to run as, I haven't done it in 20 years. Now after a day off, I can do two miles without stopping. I do four to five miles on the treadmill and nine miles on the bike besides the sit ups, pushups, kettlebells, core and weights. I look forward to next year's competitive shooting season. I'm going to bring it at this point, my cravings are gone and I actually recoil from the smell of booze. When I started this, I thought it would be temporary. Now it's going to be permanent. No reason to waste time with it anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       Now when I questioned something, your voice comes to me with the hard answer. It's only black and white with no gray area,

Speaker 5:          01:38:06       okay?

Speaker 1:          01:38:06       One day when I'm standing before the Lord, Lord and hear his voice, if it doesn't sound like yours, I might be disappointed. The book I read those months ago was the way of the war. Your Kid, I'm working on extreme ownership now. Thank you for your service. Thank you for producing a bad ass podcast and thank you for influencing my life. So there you go. And I, I say this to people all the time. Okay? Most important here is it isn't me, it's you and sure you may have grabbed some little foot hold from the podcast or from one of the books, but it isn't me. That changes you. It's you.

Speaker 5:          01:39:06       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:39:07       You set the small goals, you achieve those goals, then set some more and achieve those and set some more goals. Maybe a little bit bigger but not that much bigger. You pay attention to the progress. This guy is 16 weeks deep, 30 pounds lighter, working harder, stronger, faster, more efficient, competitive. The individual that wrote that is getting after it and changing his life. And you can't too. Just start, just start small. Start with changing tomorrow morning. Just tomorrow morning. Get that squared away.

Speaker 5:          01:40:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:40:02       And then move on to the next day and the next and move your life to a better place. One little step, one little victory at a time. Appreciate the letter. And I think that's all I've got for tonight. So Echo speaking of people getting better, stronger and faster and actually supporting the podcast if they want to do that. Sure. Do you have any suggestions for us? Sure, of course. I can talk about the fact that origin has a new key coming out. Good one.

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       I don't know that the name of the game. You know, geese have names, you know, like, okay, we'll origin does. Yup. Yup. That's a cool name too by the way. Axiom. But this one is called I think discipline discipline, I think it's called discipline might be called discipline. Yeah. Not The discipline does just discuss discipline. I that could be called that. Sure. You could check it out. Origin main.com. Right. Surprisingly aesthetically

Speaker 2:          01:41:24       great. I would say it's, I would say it's probably is the term they use like on brand on brand, meaning it kind of fit fits your brand. Okay, sure. Let's say it does that. Yeah. Yeah. It totally does it. Um, it's like, yeah, it does. It's not the kind of where, you know how like some geese, like you look at him, you can tell there's like all these bells and whistles as far as decorations go. That's a good word. Decorations. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, but he was looking for decking. Right. Here's the thing though. There are some, there are some, uh, how should I say functional decorations and now that's not actually a good word for it anyway. It, it looks cool. Put it that way. It looks cool and it will basically um, kind of lighter weight, one for functionality but awesome nonetheless. Uh, look at it.

Speaker 2:          01:42:22       I got a white one. I know you got the black one. How do you know I don't have both. Yeah, I'm sure you do it both. I'm still working on the black one but that's the long story nonetheless. It's a good one. And a lot like back when we first started everyone would ask them that. I don't want to say everyone, but a lot of people. Yeah. You know, I don't like to, it feels weird like yeah, a lot of people, people, some people. But the thing is a lot of people though, cause like a lot of people ask, should I get, I'm making the disclaimer. It was a lot of people, it wasn't the kind of like, Oh, you know, my little brother asked me once and then ask me again. It was. It's a lot of people maybe two times a week,

Speaker 2:          01:43:08       two times a week for two years. By the way, that's a lot of people. It's a decent amount of skin. The same exact question. Anyway, they ask like, oh, what can eat? Should I get? Or whatever. Now there's like, yeah, origin gies and then now I'm saying get this one. This is the one that's straight up. I don't know that I'll wear any other key. I'm not saying I won't. I'm just saying I don't know that I, yeah, and actually I don't know if you know this, did you know that they're going to sell this g and a certain number of them? 400 you're going to get a copy of discipline equals freedom field manual signed. I signed it, so if you want a signed copy, you know g and yeah, that'd be cool. It's like a little little packages, a little discipline package. Yeah. If you end up

Speaker 3:          01:43:51       hating Jujitsu, what do you do to hang up? Hang up, hang up the hin. Hopefully you don't hate Jujitsu like that one. A question today. Yeah. Hopefully you love Jujitsu, most likely you'll love Jujitsu. Good. Yeah, hopefully. Yeah, if you're getting the discipline equals freedom, gay as a discipline equals freedom. Get or just discipline. Just be all the deaf geek. I Dunno. Well, yeah, that's good. Deef disappointing. Go through them. It's good. It's embroidered as the American May. Yeah, and it is made in America, like all the words and stuff, but yes. Yeah, that's a good one. Anyway, look at Dalen get down. If you're still looking for a GIG, get down. Even if you're not looking for a, you just look at this and pick worth. He said on Twitter, he's going to get the [inaudible]. You know he's not training Jujitsu and then actually I have, I didn't respond to Brandon, but I'll respond right now.

Speaker 3:          01:44:41       Get the G and train Jujitsu. It's the kind of where he's gonna. He's gonna by the way. He's going to get the GIG. It's like, but then train Jujitsu or dude, he's going to come on. That's my bet. I almost am challenging him to prove me wrong. That's how much anyway prove to everyone that he could do a hundred burpees and 10 minutes. It was a challenge for her. It's hard for him, but he did it. Yeah. And that was, he's a reasonable challenge on the mat. Yeah, he's gonna you can't just get the gains when you put it on. And this goes for pretty much any like legitimate gay when you put it on your tray. And this is true, like you ever, um, like we, we did it in Maine. Like it happens all the time when you had you put on the gay just to grab, I grab it.

Speaker 3:          01:45:24       You're like, oh, it's time, you know, kind of thing. Same exact thing. Yeah, exactly. Right. Cool. And this guy is no different. In fact, it might even have that even more that feeling. Yeah. Yeah. Good nonetheless. Um, yeah, so it comes from origin. If you didn't already pick that part up. Origin main.com. There's a lot of Gisele in there. Even if you want to get a another one other than the you don't want to do. I have all the patches that you know how like like Naco Nolan and they'll give you these patches and stuff like that. I'm going to have all of them on Maggie. All of them. How many do you have? About 12 cause I have like 90 I've got so many awesome patches from fire departments, police departments, military units all over the country. Foreign. Yeah. I got a lot of stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:46:20       That would be a biggie. Yeah, you got to put them on multiple. Jeez. If you got the black and the white, it wouldn't have enough room. Yeah. Tan a lot of patches, bro. Yeah. Yeah. And there's certain places you can't really put them to, so that even limits you more. But I'm doing it. I'm starting it and if I run out of space, I'm getting another geek. Boom. I'm going to keep it going. I do kind of risk people saying, hey, you're not law enforcement. Why are you wearing that patch? Like some of those patches to me seem like you, you give me a NASA

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       one, like that's to shoot. Should I be even wearing this patch? We got friends at NASA, I'm going to wear it and we'll say this is from my friends at NASA. Great up. Anyway. Anyway, back to origin, origin. That's all American made stuff from the cotton out of the ground. American to the factory. American factory in America, in Maine. Make the material, make the clothing, make the gies, make the rash guards make do. What else do they have? Some bags, gym bags and whatnot. Accessories, I believe they're called accessories. Yeah. Like beanies and tee shirts. All made in America. Yeah. I think when I told Jordan Peterson that, I think he liked it even though even though he's not American. Yeah, yeah. Still and and the supplements. Yeah, from origin labs yet those are Jocko supplements. So here's the thing, I'm going to, I'll go into the details later.

Speaker 2:          01:47:51       But Super Krill. There is a legitimate difference between Super Krill in regular Krill oil. There is, and it's very beneficial. I'm not going to say it right now, but just know super krill oil, Jocko, brand, joint warfare, Jocko brand for your joints, supplements, boom. Jocko came out with it. That's the stuff from the beginning. That was the main supplements, you know, joint stuff. Krill oil, you're the number one reason, not even the number. And the only reason I started taking it and I'm kind of mad. I didn't take it before. Yeah. You were behind and now you got your own one, which is even better. Yeah, it's super, it's super as a matter of paper. Yeah. But it's not just a name though. The joint warfare has, uh, some magic in it. Sure. In my opinion. Sure. And, and in my shoulders opinion. Yeah. Left shoulder both of my shoulders, my back and my elbows. So yeah. Or domain.com. That's the place to go. Also, some legitimate fitness gear. Everyone knows I'm into kettle bells now.

Speaker 2:          01:48:57       I get mine from on it. They're the cool ones. Straight up. That's it. I don't think I could go back to regular kettlebells. It's my opinion. The Werewolf at the big foot, 90 pounds, two pounds heavier than Jockos heaviest kettle bell. Every rep, I think Jordan Peterson was impressed with that too by the way. He was. That makes one of us also. Oh sorry. [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko that's the one good spot. You know also good way to support when you buy books that Jocko reviews, I guess technically I kind of had help review them in a real kind of distant direct, yes, indirect way. Anyway, those books, very compelling books when you get them go through the website Jocko, podcast.com little tab on the top says books from podcasts. Go through there by the books through there. That's a good way to support take you to Amazon shop. Just the way you know, prime one day shipping, whatever you choose. Just like anything else but go through that. It's a good way to support and do any other shopping you have to do. Carry on. Good way to support. Also subscribe to the podcast on Itunes, stitcher, Google play depending on what kind of

Speaker 2:          01:50:17       platform you prefer or is available to you. Cause iPhone I think doesn't have stitcher, right? No. My iPhone has stitcher. Oh wait, no. Android doesn't have a l s I don't know. Apple. Yeah. I don't think you could listen to it. I don't. Maybe, I don't know either. I Dunno, but you can get it man. Yeah. Your podcast is out there. You can subscribe to it. The point is subscribed to it. Yes. Yes. Subscribe to it on that one. It's a good leave a review if you want. If you're in the mood, leave review. Also subscribe to it on Youtube.

Speaker 2:          01:50:50       The video version of this podcast is a good one still, and I still do get the whole thing like, oh, echo, you don't look like you sound. And I remember it. Change the way you talk. Yeah. Yeah. Or change the way I look. I don't give her no. Get skinny. Yeah. Get less jacked. That is it. It's kind of an intuitive thing. Youtube comments like one out of every 20 youtube comments is Echos Jack. Yeah, that's flooded. It kind of is because you wouldn't think that you could determine what someone looks like by what they sound like. But it feels like you can, I think a lot of times you can. I don't know though, actually now that you think about like talk show hosts on radios. Yeah. Yeah. You don't know what yeah, it's kind of can't I guess it's uh, it's, it's, it's harder to do than you think.

Speaker 2:          01:51:41       Yeah. If feels like you can't. Yeah. If someone has like a d, I dunno, like a deep voice. You think they're huge or something or you know, like something like that. Not necessarily true. Yeah, not true at all. Remember that Seinfeld One? No, they're there. The guy who was like, she, I think Elaine, who's the girl in there? [inaudible] she was like, oh, he had a good looking voice or something. Like he sounded like he was good looking or something like that. How'd it turn out at the, I don't know. I forget. I think he was telling that story. You remember it? Yeah. The analogy, I didn't remember it, but it reminded me of that nonetheless. Anyway, youtube subscribe to Youtube. That's the point there. Regardless of if you want to know what I look like or not. Doesn't even matter what I look like. Really?

Speaker 2:          01:52:27       Barely. Maybe a little bit I guess maybe I see because if I see you out in the wild, it'll you know, we can recognize each other if you know what I look like beneficial. There's times when people will recognize you and your like say, Oh yeah, this is Echo Charles. Ian, you can tell on their face like are you sure that this is talking to you though? Kind of encountered that for sure. For real like I know for sure. That's cool. I dig it but if you want to avoid that kind of situation, subscribe to Youtube, good way to do it and could witness support. Also Jack was a store. It's called Jocko store Jocko store.com we have tee shirts on there. If you want these tee shirts. I'm wearing my good tee shirt right now. I haven't worn this one anytime. The original. That's really high quality layers too by the way.

Speaker 2:          01:53:20       The good is backwards to look at in the mirror. That message is for you. If you think about the whole message of good, I mean I know you said it, you know, you know you were like good kind of thing, but you were kind of like you guys had the, the luxury of you being there to be able to explain it. If someone's going through like something hard, it's, you can't just automatically just say good. It kind of comes off kind of weird. Yeah, potentially. That's why I put this backwards cause it's like you tell yourself good. You see what I'm saying? That's the layer. That's the little insight to the layer. I'm not going to go deep and I'm not going to go into any of the other explanations for the other layers, but just know that they have layers on all the clothing on Jacqueline, store.com check it out.

Speaker 2:          01:54:07       I'm not saying to buy something. I'm saying go on there, look on there. If you like something, get something good way to support this. A women's stuff on their t shirts. Like I said, some patches, rash guards for Jujitsu or anything physical cycling, anything requiring range of motion. Maybe some compression situations. Highest static value but not too high because it's more about functionality. That's my take on the whole deal. But they do look good and they have layers. Hoodies are in being shipped out right now. They're in heavy. Do you have one? No, Dang girl. Sorry.

Speaker 2:          01:54:49       Well we are in California so you know it's not that big of a deal. You know you got your old one, it's all good. But yeah there's some hoodies on there. Some warrior kid's rash guards are coming. Boom cause people have been asking me about that cause I wore one that was like a test one and I wore one when I was training with Dave, Dave Burke and they're like oh where you could rush card, you know, whatever. But I was trying to narrow down kind of the colors and stuff but they are narrowed down and they shouldn't be available within the next week and a half. Where are those made? Those are made all in America. All in America where he keyed rash guards. Also, there's another kind of cool, fun one, but I want to talk about Dell until later. Also, good way to support yourself. Psychological warfare, if you didn't know what that is, it's an album with tracks, Jocko tracks and there are to aid you in the event of you needing aid and you're campaigning against weakness on your path, on the path.

Speaker 2:          01:55:49       Okay, so here's the thing about the path. It's not always going to be easy. You know what I'm saying? I know what you're saying. Yeah. Every day, man, this is not a one day Gig. This is in every day. Every day is a Monday on the path. Here's, I will say this though. Okay, so, and you, you read the letter for the guy with drinking. I guess I could relate to that deeply. Deeply could relate to that and in a way, and I don't want to go too deep into it, but in a way that my situation was in a way harder because the drinking wasn't preventing me from working out. It wasn't preventing me from doing like a lot of stuff. It was only preventing me from doing like a handful of things, but those things are really wanted to do, but it was really preventing me or it was put it this way, it was making it super difficult and then just the fact of like I'm drinking every single day, you know kind of thing.

Speaker 2:          01:56:45       And the more you do, you know how you, the more you get in the routine on some with something, the harder, the harder it is to just straight a break. That routine, especially when it provides the payoff is like drinking does chemically, I mean, you know like when you drink it like an instantaneous exactly right. The longterm payoff, no longterm negative, like not even proportionately more beneficial to, to to stop drinking. Like you know when he said, wow, this is how every day people walk around feeling good. Really. I felt that statement. Right. That's so true. That's exactly what I thought. I'm like Dang, no wonder. Tricky tricking these feed Jocko doesn't drink. Right. So no wonder Jack was doing all this stuff and I could, I could do all that stuff too. That's how you feel. I'm not saying I'm doing all this stuff. Well, I'm just saying that's the feeling. Psyche. I could dig it anyway. Point is when you're on this path, it's not always easy, but psychological warfare is there to get you through those difficult parts parts that you admit or that you can admit that you need. Maybe a little little push, a little help, little spot, waking up early, procrastinating. That's a big one.

Speaker 2:          01:57:55       Skipping the workout, that kind of stuff. Psychological warfare. Okay, so there's a track for every little weakness he might encounter. Skipping the Diet or, or, or slacking on the Diet. That's a good one. Um, but yeah, check that one out and uh, you know, see what up. Good way to support yourself in. You're on the path when you're on the path and support the podcast as well. Also, you can get some Jocko white tea, which tastes like victory and will make you feel really good. You get that on Amazon. The books way, the warrior kid number one, which we just covered. Obviously it is not just a book for kids. Yeah. Uncle Jake has something to teach. All of us, myself included, it's for adults and teenagers and anyone else that wants to have a better life. Can I add something about where the work? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       Which, and a I'm on a cycle. I just read it over and over again. Like as just like a routine to your daughter. Daughter. Yeah. She's four and a half so she can't quite read yet. Um, but there's little things in there that it's like, this is really good that these kids are getting this, this message because it's stuff that as an adult you're like, Dang, I never really, even though you know it, like, okay, and this is what it is. When you're like, how do you expect to be good at something if you don't practice? Like kids don't know that they don't, they straight up don't. Yeah. And guided practice, we kind of forget that in a way. No, we absolutely do. Yeah. So yeah, it's for sure there's a lot in that book and sometimes I read that book and I, and, and there's even more in there than I even recognized.

Speaker 1:          01:59:30       You know what I mean? The lessons that are coming out of my head, they're so important. They're like beyond my own comprehension. And I was just explaining the book way of the Warrior Kid too, which is going to come out. And I was, I was just talking through a, uh, with a guy yesterday. Like what, what it's about. And as I'm explaining everything that it's about, it's a lot of stuff and it's a lot of really important lessons. Yes. Um, but yeah, it starts with the way of the warrior kid. Uh, the second warrior could book will be out April 28th, 2018 actually speaking of books, there is extreme ownership. A new edition, a new edition is out. It's not a totally new book. It's a new addition of it. It's going to be available November 21st. You can get it for preorder right now on Amazon if you want it.

Speaker 1:          02:00:16       Um, it's got a new forward in it. So, so Leif and I wrote a new forward, it has some color pictures in it. Um, also the, the new cover is black. We changed the color from white to black. Why? Because block dope. Yes, because it looks cooler way cooler. Also, and this is interesting, there's a new Q and a section in the back of the book that is actually from this podcast. So I kind of rounded up the most prominent leadership questions that, that, that we've answered on this podcast and wrote them up and kind of Ed had it, added him a little bit to make sure that they made sense without, without everything we've talked about today without the tone and the pacing of what's being said. Excited, edit them a little bit, but they're there what they're, what the answers were given on this podcast and they're all from everyone's questions.

Speaker 1:          02:01:09       So everyone, uh, appreciate the questions. Everyone that listens to the podcast, you helped us write this next section of this book. Echo Charles is in it as the question asker. So Echo Charles is in the book and I'll hold it up if you're on youtube, there's the new book right there. Boom, discipline or sorry, extreme ownership available November 21st also you can get the book discipline equals freedom field manual. It's a manual for getting after it. So if you want to get after it, get, get the field manual. Discipline equals freedom, faults and actions. They're both in there. It's been great. Again, getting great feedback. Appreciate everyone's feedback. It's pretty straightforward book. No fluff involved, not, not making you read a bunch of words to get to my point. Here's my point. Boom. You can get it anywhere that they, that they sell books including obviously Amazon, Barnes and noble.

Speaker 1:          02:02:17       You can get it at Walmart by the way. Target the publisher, ship that out to everywhere so you can pick it up. It's a good book to give to people. In my opinion. It's, it's, it's not just like giving someone a book, you're giving them something a little bit more than a book. It's like something a little bit more than a book. It's, I dunno if I can't, I can't explain it too well right now. Look at it. Yeah. Yeah. You can look at it. It's, it's not normal. I would say it's not normal. Um, if you want the audio version of that book, which a lot of people have been asking about, the audio version is available. It is not on audible and it is not going to be on audible. It is made and we put it together, echo directed and produced the album that also has tracks so it's an album with tracks and it's available as MP3 anywhere that you can get MP3 tracks for sale, iTunes, Amazon, music, music, Google play, wherever.

Speaker 1:          02:03:20       Whenever MP3 platform you utilize, you can find it there and if you like the leadership principles that we talk about on this podcast and you want to get them for your team or your business. We have a leadership and management consulting company. It's called echelon front. It's me. It's Lafe Babin. It's JP Denelle. It's Dave Burke. You can email info@echelonfrontdotcomoryoucanjustcheckoutthewebsiteechelonfront.com and if you have more questions or you have answers to the questions that we covered that are better than the answers that we gave today and you want to share them with us, that'd be cool. I want to learn, you can find us. We're actually on the interwebs, on Twitter, on Instagram, on Dash facey bowl. Aha. Echo is an echo. Charles and I am at Jocko Willink and to close out, I want to say thanks to our military that's out there on the front lines. I recently got reports of Isis in Iraq sending kids to, to surrender to coalition forces, but they'd been laden with suicide bombs and rigged to blow up and as these kids would approach the areas set aside for surrender to American forces, they would, the Americans would see the terror in their eyes and realize that there was something wrong.

Speaker 1:          02:04:45       And American military men, especially explosive ordinance disposal technicians would risk their lives time and time again to go disarm these bombs, risking their lives so that these young children can live. Who? Who even does that?

Speaker 5:          02:05:09       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:05:09       I'll tell you who America's servicemen and women.

Speaker 5:          02:05:14       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:05:14       they are the finest and we thank them for their service and sacrifice and to police and law enforcement, firefighters or paramedics, other first responders. Thank you for doing your job. Extremely difficult, often thankless, keeping us safe here on the home front and to everyone else that is listening. Remember this, if there's something in your life that you want to change, then change it. You have control. And if you don't think you have control, then take control. Get a grip on your life and start getting after it. So until next time, this is echo and Jocko out.
