Speaker 1:          00:00          I've heard it called a death letter.

Speaker 2:          00:06          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:07          but I don't know if that is the actual name. I don't know if it has an actual name, but I do know what it is. It is something that soldiers sometimes, right when they deploy into harms way.

Speaker 2:          00:34          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35          Then they put it with your gear or in a foot locker where it will be found or they give it to a friend to pass on in case they die.

Speaker 2:          00:51          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52          A letter to the family. They won't see you again.

Speaker 2:          00:59          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59          To mothers that gave them life to fathers that raised them to wives that they left at home to children they miss and in some cases to the children they've never even met.

Speaker 2:          01:28          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:30          It's a good by letter with the title. Something like in case I don't come home. Well, Jesse givens of Springfield, Missouri wrote one of those letters. He wrote it to his wife Melissa and their son, Dakota nickname toad and to their unborn son, nickname bean, who would ultimately be named Carson. And here is what he said in that letter in case he didn't come home. My family. I never thought I would be writing a letter like this. I really don't know where to start. I've been getting bad feelings though and well, if you're reading this, I am forever in to you, Dakota and the bean. I searched all my life for a dream and I found it in you.

Speaker 2:          03:09          Okay?

Speaker 1:          03:10          I would like to think that I made a positive difference in your lives. I will never be able to make up for the bad. I am so sorry. The happiest moments in my life all deal with my little family. I will always have with me the small moments we all shared.

Speaker 2:          03:38          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:39          The moments when you quit taking life so seriously and smiled. The sounds of a beautiful boys laughter or the simple nudge of a baby unborn. You will never know how complete you have made me each and every one of you. You saved me from loneliness and taught me how to think beyond myself. You taught me how to live and to love. You opened my eyes to a world I never dreamed existed.

Speaker 2:          04:26          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:27          All right. I'm proud of you. Stay on the path you choose. Never lose sight of what is important. You and our babies, Dakota, you are more sun than I could ever ask for. I can only hope I was half the dad. I used to be your Danny, but no matter what, it makes me proud that you chose me. You taught me how to care until it hurts. You've taught me how to smile again.

Speaker 2:          05:10          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          05:11          you taught me that life isn't so serious and sometimes you have to play. You have a big beautiful heart through life. You need to keep it open and follow it. Never be afraid to be yourself. I will always be there in our park when you dream so we can still play. I hope someday you will have a son like mine. Make them smile and shine just like you.

Speaker 2:          05:51          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:52          I love you towed and I hope someday you will understand why I didn't come home. Please be proud of me. Please don't stop loving life.

Speaker 1:          06:09          take in every breath like it's your first.

Speaker 2:          06:14          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:14          I love you towed. I will always be there with you. I'll be in the sun shadows, dreams and joys of your life.

Speaker 2:          06:32          Okay,

Speaker 1:          06:32          baby. Been,

Speaker 2:          06:35          yeah,

Speaker 1:          06:36          I never got to see you, but I know in my heart you are beautiful. I know you will be strong and big hearted just like your mom and brother. I will always have with me the fuel of the soft nudge is on your mom's belly and the joy I felt when we found out you were on your way.

Speaker 2:          07:01          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:02          Hi, dream of you every night. I always will. Don't ever think that since I wasn't around that I didn't love you.

Speaker 2:          07:12          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:13          You were conceived of love and I came to this terrible place for love. I love you as I do your mom and brother with all my heart and soul. Please understand that I had to be gone so that I could take care of my family. I love you being, I have never been so blessed as the day I met Melissa.

I'll be there with you. Melissa, I will always want you, need you and love you in my heart, mind and soul. Do me a favor. After you talk towed in Benin, give them hugs and kisses from me. Go outside, look at the stars and count them. Don't forget to smile. Love always your husband, Jess and Jessie didn't come home on May. First 2003 Jesse givens was killed while conducting combat operations in Hominy, Iraq. When is Abrams tank plunged into the Euphrates river? After the bank along the river collapsed, the three other crew members made it out of the tank. Jesse did not. Oh, another brave warrior garden like so many other warriors. He left behind a family, a wife, and children, and the mother and father and friends and life you have behind everything.

Let us remember those soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, those brave warriors who for us, for our freedom, left everything behind. And after the sun sets on this memorial day and darkness consumes the sky, go outside.

Speaker 2:          12:27          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          12:28          And look up,
