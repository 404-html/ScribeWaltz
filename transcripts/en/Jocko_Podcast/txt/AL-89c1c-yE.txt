Speaker 1:          00:00          This is Jocko podcast number 97 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening to the master stone Mason in the town of Mansfield.

Speaker 1:          00:20          Greetings and God, much beloved parents. If my small letter finds you in good health, I should be mightily glad. What concerns me? I am pretty much in health here in the white country will have to die. All of hunger, all is burnt and the Russian army has carried off all subjects as they had such a fear of us and there is no food to be found because nobody is to be found in any town. Whenever a house is found, it is empty and dark. Dear parents, I have to give news of our last battle as we had already gone hungry for three days and March day and night at five in the morning, we marched into this battle with the cabbage stump in our stomach and we were in in it until the evening and then we again had nothing and could not eat for tiredness. Only cannon fire from morning to evening.

Speaker 1:          01:34          God has helped me out of the third battle. Also without harm though. The bullets hailed down pretty well as if one were to take peas and throw them at someone, but none got me. The whole cavalry is lost. Now I want to write you about the Russian town of misery, Moscow, which is seven hours walk along and as wide and the Russians put fire to it for four hours at burned and then it was extinguished and we were stationed before Moscow. And I don't know whether we are going forward or back. I don't know what to write except that you will shortly see many cripples without arm and leg and so many must die pitifully of hunger and terrible dangers. Russians appear all the time for the last battle. Let's end now. Finally, farewell and stay healthy until we speak again. Many greetings to brothers and sisters, brothers in law and sisters in law to the Balts ans the Krogans and all good friends and acquaintances and I am quite well if only I can live farewell. I remain your faithful son until death.

Speaker 1:          03:07          Johann Andreas Warner. So Napoleon who is often praised by many in coding myself, praised as a military genius. And he was one of the first military leaders to effectively utilize psychological warfare. And this included most famously his bulletin's de la Grand Army, which was sort of an update. It was like a newspaper that was sent out while the campaigns of France or being embarked upon. And that was his media. So he had control of it and he also controlled the mail that his troops sent home and made sure that it painted a positive picture of what was happening down range. And that is where that opening letter came from, that it was actually excerpts of a letter, but it was confiscated by the military of the Kingdom of Westfalia, which was a vassal state under the first French empire, which was Napoleon's empire and the Kingdom of West Valeo, which is a German piece of land. And it provided hundreds of thousands of soldiers for the Napoleonic wars.

Speaker 1:          04:39          And when I say provided soldiers, I should say specifically calm scripts, which are basically slave soldiers, you have no choice. You will go and fight and overtime Westfalia eventually conquered by the Russians for a period. And then some of the confiscated letters survived. And ended up as historical documents that explained what was happening on the ground. And that's where that letter came from through old Russian files where they had, they had this letter, and again, we make a habit of glorifying Napoleon and I have done it right here on this podcast, which is actually pretty substandard behavior for me since I always try to listen to the voice and hear the voice and understand the viewpoint of the foot soldier, the grunt, the front line troops on the battlefield. Because that is where the fighting takes place. Those are the men that execute the plans of the general. And that is where the wars are actually want. And history as a whole has a tendency to forget about them because generally it's the admirals and the generals that right the memoirs. But in this case we are going to hear from one of Napoleon's grunts, a guy by the name of Jacob Walter, and he is a German conscripts who was fighting for France. So this is a guy grew up in Germany, but when Germany was, became part of and became a vassal state, like a subordinate state of the empire France. Then he ended up fighting for France, but even more, and you're going to find this out quickly. He was fighting for his own survival.

Speaker 1:          06:56          So let's go to this book. The book is called the diary of a Napoleonic foot soldier by Jacob Walter.

Speaker 1:          07:09          And here we go. In the year 1806 I was drafted with many of my comrades into military service in the conscription at that time and was assigned to the regimen of Romaic in the fall. I traveled with the regiment to Prussia in the campaign, which Emperor Napoleon with the princes then his allies was conducting at that time against pressure. And this is interesting because I've talked about on this podcast before, the battle of Jenna and what happened at the battle of Jenna and what happened at the battle of is that the Prussian army was defeated pretty savagely by Napoleon's army. And that made them make some major adjustments to the way they ran things. And that was kind of the beginning of decentralized command from the German perspective. But this guy, Walter Jacob Walter was actually there.

Speaker 1:          08:07          Now this is what's interesting, and I, I, I go take some time to paint this picture of the way these soldiers operated back then. First of all, they marched just about everywhere and sometimes they'd ride horses, but sometimes they are, but most of the Times they marched and when they marched, what they would do is just wherever they were, whatever village they were in, they would go in and get quarters in that village. They'd go in, hey, we're here where we need to stay in your house and we need to get fed. And that's what they did. And people allowed them to do it. I mean, a bunch of people with guns show up at your house and say, we want food and beds. You, you know, these people gave them what they wanted sometimes willingly, depending when they were traveling out of their own country. So when they were in Germany there or in their Westfalia, the locals as they were leaving, the locals would give him, Hey, we'll support you. It's like military guy, we'll support you. And then when they got into enemy territory, they would be asked to be more forceful. But here's how it starts off with him marching.

Speaker 1:          09:08          We were given good quarters everywhere, which kept me always healthy and cheerful in spite of the continuous marching. Furthermore, I was only 19 years old, a fact, which caused me frequently to participate in thoughtless and dangerous enterprises. I think he was getting after it as a young 19 year old, and this is another thing that's interesting. So this guy, these conscripts, they weren't, they weren't permanent soldiers. They were more like reservists where they would go and fight and win. The war was over. They go back home and continue with whatever their job was. And so that's what happens to him. He, you know, gets tasked. He's only 19 years old. Boom, you're going to go fight. He says, okay. He starts going in, marching back to the book in this city. It happened in my quarter that a comrade wanted to force the landlord to sing. However he refused to do so. Sitting the whole night on a bench near the stove, weeping. Since this man could not sing because of his sorrow, sorrow, soldier, Hummel wanting to frighten him, took his rifle, cock the hammer and shot the bullet passed by me and another soldier and lodged in the wall. I wanted to mention this in order to show how the soldiers were running wild at that time. So like I said, when they were in their own country, they'd get good support and everyone would take care of them, but then the further they got into other countries, they had to use force.

Speaker 2:          10:24          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          10:26          A spy who was in the village, a spy who was a village. Smith was brought before the guard house. He had letters in orders to tell Prussians of our strength in manpower. He was laid on a bench and whipped by two or three corporals. Two men had to hold his feet and to his head, his leather breaches were stretched out and water poured on them. And then he received about 150 blows.

Speaker 2:          10:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:55          At last he could no longer speak because he was half dead after this experience, the Smith was taking to the threshing floor and shot.

Speaker 2:          11:07          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:07          Glows with clubs also were heaped upon many innocent people in this city. So these guys are things turn bad real quick. Things turn bad real quick. And I can't even imagine these days where there's a lot less accountability and you have 19 year old soldiers coming into towns and just basically doing whatever they want back to the book. Finally, when light fire, now they're getting into uh, an attack situation. Finally, when light firing began upon the outpost, we were commanded to attack by waiting through the rampart ditches with fancy jeans, with fast scenes to tread these in and to scramble up the outworks by chopping and shoveling. When I stood in the ditch, each first soldier had to pull up the next one with his rifle. The ramparts were of sand and everyone frequently fell back again because of the attack of the enemy or just because of the sliding sand.

Speaker 1:          12:08          Yet in that place, the huge cannon balls flew above us funding so violently that we would have believed the earth would burst to pieces when everyone was almost on top of the earthwork. The Prussians were slaughtered with great vigor and the rest took flight into the gate. Then we to wanted to gain possession of the gateway in order to enter the city, but at this critical time, many of these Prussians were shot along with our men by small and large guns and the gate was closed since all sorts of shells and rockets broke out of the fortress like a cloudburst. We had to take flight. Those who meanwhile we're scrambling up. The outworks had to jump from the fortress into the mote along with their prisoners and all the rest had to do likewise. During this retreat, many fell on bay in nets. Many drowned and many of us were also brought into the fortress as prisoners and sent away to Danzig by see.

Speaker 1:          13:06          Now it's interesting, this guy, the way he writes, it's very matter of fact as to what happens, and again, this is a relatively, I'm going to take you to through three campaigns. This is the first one. The last one is the campaign and Russia, the famous Napoleon's famous march into Russia to try and take Russia at and everyone knows how that story ends. It's not good, but this first one is, like I said, against the Prussians back to the book one morning, the Prussian surprise, the Polish camp from the sea with their ships. As it happened before Easter, the cannon fire on the polls was so heavy that they could not withdraw fast enough. Their cannon balls also traveled more than half again as far toward our camp as all balls date across the water since the surrounding swamps were frozen and the balls could roll along on ice so fast that one ball took off the feet and legs of 10 or 12 men frequently, both feet of the same man. During this blockade, the Prussians frequently made attacks, although every time with great losses, one the nightmare that is you're standing on frozen swamps and these cannonballs or.
