Speaker 1:          00:00:01       This is Jocko podcast number 81 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. November 29th, 1915 it has teamed the trenches or ankle deep. Some places calf deep in mud and the communications trenches are rushing streams of brown water. The men are wet through, but stick the job like Britain's and I hope for their sake that the weather lifts with the morning. But guns have been strafing today though. Up Til now we have dodged the show. It may be ours again tomorrow though one never knows. This is from the diary of Captain Charlie May, the British Army Officer Commander of B Company 22nd Manchester Pals Battalion of the Manchester Regiment who served in World War One. He was married to Bessie Mae and they had one daughter who was born July 20th, 1914 so she was a little over a year old when this journal was being written from the trenches and it continues December 1st, 1915 it is exciting work. Sniping in fact, one must curb the tendency lest it should become a fascination. The second in command of the e Lance, the East Lanchester regimen and myself putting a couple hours this morning and had quite a bit of fun worrying the batches in their trenches. One fellow was walking across the open 2000 yards off when I spotted him and let go.

Speaker 1:          00:02:24       You never saw a chap move quicker in your life.

Speaker 2:          00:02:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       He ran for a tree and jumped behind it and I let him have four more there. Whether I got them or not, I don't know, but he didn't move for the next half hour. I know because I waited so anxiously for him last night or rather one 30 this morning. I got outside the barbed wire and got lost three times. I had to fling myself down in the wet grass, bury my nose in it and grovel while the machine guns went chattering over me.

Speaker 2:          00:03:03       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:03:04       it is remarkable with what speed one learns to adopt the prone position. January 13th, 1916 I long and long to see you to clasp you in my arms and I long with all my heart to see my baby, how I love her. What hopes I have for her. What a sweet girl she will make. February 25th, 1916 woke up this morning to find the snow pelting down and covering the ground fully five inches deep. Also, it was freezing hard cotton. A fellow officer came in to breakfast with us. He brought the Little Bible which another soldier had taken from the body of a dead German on the fly leaf in a child's handwriting. The word Dada war is very sad. Perhaps the man may have done and been something to loathe and detest. I do not know. All I am conscious of is that somewhere in his father land there is a little child who called Him Dad. Dad.

Speaker 2:          00:04:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:44       April 6th, 1916 fritz strafed our new trenches with heavies and searched around the support with hg shrapnel and other such an obnoxious stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:04:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:58       One shell claimed three NCO and wounded three men. We all feel wild to get at the beast and I hope we may string them up on the wire. I saw the kill to go down the line. It was a pitiful sight. Poor boys. Shell fire is a horrid thing. Grasty a lad who was a sergeant of mine was the worst. His body full of gaping holes. It was very, very sad. Do those at home realize how their boys go out for them?

Speaker 2:          00:05:46       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:05:48       never can they do enough for their soldiers? Never can they repay the debt they owe. Not that the men ask

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       any reward,

Speaker 1:          00:06:02       but one day we'll get at him with the bayonet. We'll take our price then for Gretzky.

Speaker 2:          00:06:10       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:06:10       and all the other hundreds, thousands Gretzky slain as they were standing at their posts.

Speaker 2:          00:06:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:22       June 17th, 1916 I do not want to die. The fought that I may never see you or are darling baby again turns my bowels to water. My conscience is clear that I've always tried to make life a joy for you, but it is the thought that our baby may grow up without my knowing her and without her knowing me. I prayed, God, I may do my duty for I know whatever that may entail, you would not have it otherwise. June 23rd, 1916 everything is speeding up to no end.

Speaker 2:          00:07:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:28       Ammunition by the hundred wagon load is pouring up. It should certainly not be for lack of ammunition if we do not make us huge success of the venture yet one cannot help feeling a little anxious and worried so much depends on this great throw.

Speaker 2:          00:07:52       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:07:53       and what he's talking about there in this part of the journal, it reflects the buildup for the battle of the Somme.

Speaker 2:          00:08:01       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:08:02       and although Charlie doesn't know exactly when the battle is going to commence, they're obviously only distributing that information with people that have the need to know. They know that a major attack is forthcoming then that's why they've got all that ammunition piled up more than they could ever think they could possibly need. Back to the journal. June 28th

Speaker 2:          00:08:32       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:32       1916 the moment seems very auspicious for us to strike. Perhaps we will on Friday.

Speaker 2:          00:08:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:51       July 1st, 1916 we marched up to the assembly trench last night. The most exciting march imaginable. Guns all around crashed and roared till some times. It was quite impossible to hear oneself speak. It was however a find site and one realized from it what gun power really means. Fritz of course strafed back and reply causing us some uneasiness and a few casualties before we even reached the line. The night past noisily and with a few more casualties. The Han puts a barrage on us every now and then and generally claims one or two victims. It is a glorious morning. We go over in two hours time. It seems a long time to wait and I think whatever happens, we shall all feel relieved once the line is launched. No Man's land is a tangled desert unless one could see it. One cannot imagine what a terrible state of disorder it is in, but we do not yet seem to have stopped the machine guns. These are popping off all along our pair of Pitt as I write.

Speaker 2:          00:10:22       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:10:23       I trust they will not claim to many of our lads before the day is over. Now I closed this old diary down for the next few days. Since I may not take it into the line, I will keep a record of how things go and enter it up later. Well, yeah, that update never took place and Charlie may was wrong about how many British soldiers would be claimed before the day was over. He didn't think he would claim to many, but as you know, the first day of the battle of the Somme, July 1st turned out to be the worst day in history

Speaker 2:          00:11:21       for the British army

Speaker 1:          00:11:24       and they suffered almost 60,000 casualties, 60,000 casualties in one day. Then like I said, those casualties included Charlie May, who went over the top on July 1st under the cover of allied artillery. He was leading B company and he didn't. His men fought their way across no man's land. And just as they reached German lines, Charlie was a hit by shell fire. They had killed in his diary, was found by the man that eventually dragged him back to the trenches private Arthur bunting who mailed the diary to Charlie's wife Maude now, or the British have a steep military history and obviously this is the kingdom that we Americans rebelled against and the revolutionary war. And we fought them again in the war of 1812

Speaker 2:          00:12:56       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:57       And we actually had a bunch of other little various disputes with them until the late 18 hundreds when during something called the great reproachment. Yeah. Through various forces in the world are political objectives or aligned. And we became the staunchest of allies with Great Britain through World War One and world war two and Korea and Vietnam. And even up til now in Iraq and Afghanistan. And I've been lucky enough to work alongside Brits on just a couple occasions while I was in the military. And there's no doubt that they are just outstanding troops professional in everything that they do. When they leave that impression on you, you can actually feel the pride of their military tradition.

Speaker 1:          00:14:04       And tonight I wanted to take at a, I look at a book that is part of that military tradition and the book is called serve to lead. And I'm going to start with some statements from the introduction to this version of the book. And the version of the book that I'm reading is the old version. I think it's from 1954 or 57 originally written right after World War Two and these comments here are from a guy named Robin Matthews, a former British army officer, graduate of the Royal Military Academy of that's like the British west point. He went on to command his regiment, the light drag goons, which included a tour of duty in Iraq in 2005 he also served with 16 air assault brigade in Helmand province in Afghanistan. And here's what he has to say about this book. Serve to lead is a remarkable book produced by the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. After the Second World War. It is as clear and concise a treaties on leadership as you will find. It also provides a fascinating glimpse into what sets the profession of arms apart from any other serve to lead is synonymous with Sandhurst placed on the bed of every officer cadet at the beginning of their military training. Somewhere between prayer book, which is what I fought, it was initially and Bible as it has often been referred, it lays out what is expected and what to expect on equivocally. It establishes selflessness, self discipline, integrity, and duty as the bedrock of leadership. Excitingly, it speaks of courage and boldness as the essential differentiators upon which events turn and to which soldiers and leaders are instinctively drawn.

Speaker 1:          00:16:24       There is so much to enjoy and consider on every page, but the most beguiling message of the book concerns humility.

Speaker 2:          00:16:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:35       Leadership must be confident, but unless it is matched in equal measure by humility, it jars at which point the lead simply fall away. If I am to lead you, first and foremost, I must be your servant.

Speaker 2:          00:16:51       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:16:52       Like any good book, the clue is in the title. In this case, simple, seemingly contradictory, but ultimately profound serve to lead

Speaker 1:          00:17:07       and that's the intro to this book and obviously there's a dichotomy of leadership. He's already talking about things that we talk about all the time and yes, you've got to be confident but you've got to be humble and the title of the book is a contradictory is a dichotomy in its own sense, right? Serve to lead. No, and like I said, this book, they actually have a new one. Then I have the new one. I went with the old one and the reason I went with the old one, there's a couple of things that we're going to play. I'm going to point out that clearly they've changed their faults on and maybe we'll end up doing a compare and contrast with the new one. There aren't that many differences, but there certainly are some very significant different differences and we'll get to those and this is going to kick off with a a piece from the Lord Bishop of Durham.

Speaker 1:          00:18:00       It is the fact that some men possess an inbred superiority which gives them a dominating influence over their contemporaries and marks them out. Unmistakably for leadership. This phenomenon is as certain as it is mysterious. It is apparent in every association of human beings in every variety of circumstances and on every plane of culture in a school among boys, in a college among the students in a factory ship yard or mine among the workman as certainly as in the church and in the nation, there are those who with an assured and unquestioned title take the leading place and shape the general conduct. So there's an opinion and people ask all the time, are leaders born or made? That one right there is, hey, leaders are born and that's I, I always say both. I always say there's, there's certain leadership qualities that people are born with and some people are born with a lot of them.

Speaker 1:          00:19:02       Some people are vulnerable, all of those qualities. Some people are born with a lot less, some people aren't born with any, they're not going to be much of a leader. He doesn't matter how much you train them. You can get them better, but they're not going to be a great leader and obviously some, some leaders don't need much training. Uh, there's very few of those leaders that just don't, they just get it out of the gate as just born that way. I think it's a mixture of both and I think you're born with some leadership capability and the more you hone it, the more you work on it, the better you're going to be. Why would you think or why do you think that is? Because to be a leader, like the good, strong qualities that you got to have or still contradict or counterintuitive, they're not even counterintuitive, but the, you can get better at all of them.

Speaker 1:          00:19:51       You know, a couple, the one that's, for instance, some people are naturally talented or some people are naturally articulate people, so they're able to get their message across in simple, clear, concise language. That's very important. Now, if you're born with that, you're lucky, right? Good job. You are born with that. You were born in articulate person. If you weren't, guess what? You're going to have to work at it. You're going to have to read, you have to write, you have to listen, you have to practice speaking to people and you will get better at it. So those, that's your example. Some people just have it naturally and, but even people that have it naturally, we'll get better at it over time. I was always pretty comfortable speaking to people, but obviously when I was in the military, I spoke to people all the time. And when I was in a training training situation as a young enlisted seal, I was put up in front of classroom to speak to people and I got better at it.

Speaker 1:          00:20:44       And then when I became an officer and a leader now I was briefing people. And so I'm doing it even more. And then I took over the training for the west coast seals and now I was briefing people all the time. And, and when I was overseas, I was briefing, you know, colonels and generals and okay, you're going to brief a bunch of times, you're going to get better at it. I was already okay at it just naturally, but I got better at it and I'm still getting better at it today. So that's the same with any of these particular talents, you know, being able to simplify things, being able to detach. Those are all important leadership qualities. You can have a certain level that you're capable at, but the more you practice them, the better off you're going to be. Yeah. Yeah. So it's a combination.

Speaker 1:          00:21:26       Yeah. So we'll have you say like there's, it's pretty rare that you get somebody who's, um, you know, just has all the qualities right out the gate. Yeah, no, I see. I've never met anybody that just, just dominates. And every category like detaching for example, that's not, that's kind of counter to your natural way. That's true. Most people are going to want to get in there for sure. Now I just thought of this example. I've talked about him a little bit on the, on the podcast where we had Tim Ferriss on all the lead Grizzard he was, uh, he was the, he was my assistant platoon commander when I was at seal team one and he got murdered. It was horrible, tragic situation. He was involved in a murder, suicide and, but he, he had a lot of those capabilities. He had a lot, like he was articulate, he was the quarterback at the navy football team.

Speaker 1:          00:22:17       So we had like a real good presence to him. He spoke clearly, he was down to earth and yet, you know, very, he could elevate himself very quickly when there's talking to them, you know, if he needed to elevate himself. He just had a lot of those qualities very naturally. And, and guess what, he was at the Naval Academy, he played football. He was constantly getting in front of, you know, getting in the huddle and telling guys what was going to happen. And you get good at that over time. And part of that is so, I don't know how much of it, you know, I didn't know him when he was a football player when he was in eighth grade, maybe he was stammering and trying to put his thoughts together, but then he trained it over and over and over again. And he got better at it.

Speaker 1:          00:22:55       And maybe by the time he got to me as a 23 year old lieutenant Jg, he was like, oh, we're going to get in a huddle. I'll tell you guys what's going on. And so, you know, even though it appeared to me like it was natural, probably wasn't, it was probably trained, you know, he had some national capability, but he played football his whole life. And that was that. Yeah. So in, in a way you can kind of, and this may be kind of interchangeable as far as the expression, but you know, you say natural capability. It could be that they gain it through learning or whatever, just through their environment, you know, like as a kid, you know? Yeah. So playing football and then they'll bring it to the training situation and they'll excel. But I think it's gotta be a little bit of both.

Speaker 1:          00:23:36       Right. And you will get better at it, but the more you focus on that particular skill, like some people aren't very comfortable talking in, in, you know, even they're not even comfortable talking in a conversation. Right? Oh yeah. Yeah. And so if you end up with a kid like that, well you got to get 'em out and socialize them and get them in, get them in front of people talking all the time. And that will be good for them. Yeah. If you have someone that's, uh, if you've got a kid or, yeah, if you've got a kid or a young leader that doesn't know when to shut up, right. How are you going to, cause sometimes leaders are like that too. They want to hear themselves talk and they just keep talking all the time. And guess what? The more you talk, the less people listen. So if I'm giving orders on every little thing that we've gotten to do in front of us, eventually you're not listening to me anymore. And when something critical comes up, you're still not listening to me cause I've been talking for the past six straight months won't shut my pie hole. So that's a bad situation. So how do we get that person to quiet down?

Speaker 3:          00:24:34       It's both. Yeah. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:24:37       So now we're going to hear from a guy named Field Marshal William Slim. I think bill slam is what they ended up calling him. And he was in World War One and World War II wounded multiple times, I think three times led the 14th army in Burma and World War II. And he also fought with the Anzac. So the, the Australia New Zealand Army Corps at [inaudible]. So you could say he's got a pretty good view of things. Sure. So he's this, believe it or not, the first this, this book kicks off with talking about morale and the morale of the troops. So here we go. Back to the book morale as a state of mind, it is that intangible force which will move a whole group of men to give their last ounce to achieve something without counting the cost to themselves that makes them feel that they are part of something greater than themselves. Now this is interesting. So, so he's talking about the importance of morale. Now going back to the subject we were just talking about, back to the book I learned too, that one did not need to be in order to be effective, two things only were necessary. First to know what you were talking about and second and most important to believe it yourself. So there you go. You don't need to be great orator, but you gotta know what you're talking about and you've got to believe it. Yeah, those are two really good places to start.

Speaker 1:          00:26:23       He continues on talking about morale. He says up a most potent factor in spreading this belief in the efficiency of an organization is a sense of discipline. We tried to make our discipline intelligent, but we were old fashioned army and we insisted on outward signs. We expected soldiers to salute and officers salute in return, both in mutual confidence and respect. I encouraged all officers to insist whenever possible, and there were few places where it was not possible on good turnout and personal cleanliness. It takes courage, especially for a young officer to check a man met on the road for not properly saluting or for slovenly appearance, but every time he does it adds to his stock of moral courage and whatever the soldier may say he has respect for the officer who does pull him up. Now this is an interesting point, right? Because what we're talking about here is, oh, I see echos, you know, not wearing his uniform correctly, so I'm going to go over and tighten you up.

Speaker 1:          00:27:28       That is, you can see where you can see where people are probably thinking, yeah, Joc will be all over that guy, right? No, actually wrong. That's a, that's actually wrong. And what we're going to talk about here is I'm going to talk about what I called leadership capital. You only have so much leadership capital in your bank and you've got to decide what as a leader, you're going to spend that capital on. And if I see you out of uniform or you're looking sloppy, I've got to decide if it's worth me investing my leadership capital and going over and telling you that you need to tighten it up. Hey Echo, you need to get that. Hey, Sergeant Charles, you need to get your uniform squared away. You look like crap. You're setting a bad example. Is that what I want to invest my leadership capital on now?

Speaker 1:          00:28:12       Can it be sometimes? Yes, absolutely. And we've talked about the many cases where that occurs. You know, when you look at at Hackworth, when hack words showed up to Vietnam as a battalion commander, he tightened up their uniform standards immediately. He tightened them up immediately. He knew he needed to invest that leadership capital. He needed to start with a small things. But if you're in a garrison situation and you see somebody that maybe isn't doing there, isn't wearing their uniform properly and you decide you're going go tighten them up, I'm not, I'm not saying it's the wrong answer. And as Leif Babin will tell you, it's not what you preach. It's what you tolerate. And so if you tolerate the guy's looking like crap, they're just going to continue going down that hill of looking like crap. Now to me, there's a certain point, right, that I won't let you go past if you're a little out of the, out of the standard made me, I'm going to let that one slide a little bit, right?

Speaker 1:          00:29:07       But once you get to a point where you're looking like crap, well guess what? I am absolutely going to tighten you up and I'm gonna explain to you why it's important. I'm just going to go and yell at you. No, not happening. So you've got to be careful how you ration your, your discipline and your leadership capital, right? If you just run around yelling at everyone or getting in everyone's face for every little thing that they're doing. Pretty soon you could look at that like, well pretty soon they'll have, they'll be scared of making a mistake. But that's, that's the point. Now you've got people that are scared of making a mistake now cutting off their ability to end their desire to think freely. So the bottom line with this balance, you got to stay balanced in these things and don't waste your leadership capital.

Speaker 1:          00:29:52       I was talking to a guy the other day, he was running a offsite for his executive team and I talked to him and, and he said, man, you know, it was just junk. And I said, well, what happened? And he had showed up to the executive offsite and he's in the company and he's the guy that's running the off site and he gets there and he says, all right guys, now while we're here, no cell phones. So everyone put your cell phones away. We need to focus this a strategic meeting. We need to, we need to get this done. So the guys put their cell phones away and they start the meeting. He's, he says five minutes into the meeting, the CEO breaks out a cell phone, starts looking at it a minute after everyone sees that you got half the room looking at their cell phones and he went like, got kind of nuts on them, you know, this is man, what's what's going on?

Speaker 1:          00:30:44       And people aren't even paying attention to. After the first at first hour he said this, you know what's going on? And I said to him, I said, Bro, let's look at what you just so then he said, then he lost them. Like the, the meeting just went downhill. And I said to him, let's talk about what you did because you invested your leadership capital for this important meeting on telling people to not use their cell phones. Did you tell him why? He's like, not really. Did you explain to them when they would be able to use their cell phones? No, I didn't. So you just went, now this company is a financial company. They've got a lot of things going on. You can imagine the CEO of a big financial companies got a lot of important calls and emails to check and all that. And all of a sudden he gets told no cell phone.

Speaker 1:          00:31:29       What does that going to end? What important thing is happening at my company today where I'm not allowed to talk on my cell phone and answer emails or look at, look at my emails and I'm the guy. So, so when am I supposed to, when would I be able to look at it? You didn't tell me that. So he invested all of his leadership capital to get people to do no cell phones and he spent it and there wasn't any left and, and the, you know, so you have to be careful. Now you have to approach it the right way, right? First of all, you could say, hey listen guys, we're going to power through a solid hour right now. I'm going to ask you, unless it's just critical, keep your cell phones put away and let's power through this. Let's get some good conversation going. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:32:09       And, and in an hour we're going to take a 20 minute break where you can catch up when you got to catch up on, and then we'll do another hour after that. So now people understand what's happening and they understand why. I'm, by the way, you know, if we, if everyone's on their cell phones, we're not going to get what we need out of this meeting. So you've got to explain and you don't want to invest your leadership capital on things that don't matter. So if you're the senior guy in a leadership position and you're focused on some little person that's out of uniform, and that's what your focus is, that's, that's not a good focus to have, right? Yeah. You should set the standard and your subordinate leadership all the way down to the front where you've got like you and me, our peers, and I don't let you, I'm the one not, I'm not waiting for the boss to come by and tighten up your uniform.

Speaker 1:          00:32:51       I won't let you tighten up. I won't let you wear a crappy looking uniform. That's what I want. I want to have a gang mentality where we're self policing because the minute I'm from the top doing that again, does this happen sometimes? Yes. I'm not setting out a, a black and white rule here. Yeah. I'm giving the broad guidance that if you're Hackworth and you're taking over battalion where people's lives are at risks and you know that there's slack everywhere and they're not doing a good job, you got to go in there and tighten them up. And one of the best ways to do that is to go in there and start on the small things. But if you've got a functioning unit that there's nothing critical happening and you're trying to build that team into something that's, that's, uh, a winning team and the first thing you could do is go in and focus on some of these small things when you haven't really established yourself, that could be problematic. So think about those things when you're in those positions. Alright. Going back to the book, I do not say that the men of the 14th army welcomed at difficulties, but they grew to take fierce pride in overcoming them by determination. Any ingenuity from start to finish, they had only two items of equipment that were never in short supply their brains and their courage. They lived up to the unofficial motto I gave them. God helps those who help themselves.

Speaker 2:          00:34:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:19       Handle. Once again, that's the same thing that colonel bill reader said, got to help yourself right now we're going to move on to still still talking about morale. We're going to talk to or to hear from Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery. If you don't know who that is. Monte World War One, the Anglo Irish war, the Palestine conflicts that disbar uprisings and World War II.

Speaker 2:          00:34:52       He,

Speaker 1:          00:34:54       you know, obviously ran the British Eighth Army World War II. So we've, once again, we've got a person with some very solid perspective on leadership and combat leadership. The quality of morale back to the book. In war, the moral stature of some men increases and their characters grow stronger and more closely knit in proportion to the discomforts and dangers. They are called upon to face. Boom. So some guys get better. Some guys rise to the occasion back to the book. Such men will occasionally perform in battle. Remarkable acts of selfless courage and daring and will endure with extraordinary fortitude and patience, the burdens frost upon them, other men. However, we'll under the stress of hardships or dangerous surrender to fear or fatigue and allow their characters to disintegrate. This disintegration, we'll usually take the form of a loosening of the moral fiber, which results in timidity of Action and slackness in appearance. While those who have gone to seed will be dirty and their appearance will be sluggish and we'll be slovenly in these later cases. There has been a general loosening of character due to partial surrender to fear.

Speaker 1:          00:36:17       So I totally agree with this. You see, in combat situations, people either get better or they get worse. Some people just kind of cruise right, stay in that same zone, but, but some people they get better when they get worse. They rise to the occasion, know where they fall back to the book. The good soldier, the man with high morale has not surrendered to fear and has maintained his personal standards. The bad soldier, the man with low morale has become incapable of independent action and has to some extent shed a part of his human individuality. That's an interesting, that's an interesting statement that the person that's incapable of independent action, he saying he shed some of his human individuality. Back to the book. Basic factors of morale. We now must considered the factors con what? What factors constitute morale of the soldier in the heat of battle? Certain factors may be described as essential conditions without which high morale cannot exist.

Speaker 1:          00:37:26       These four basic factors are one, leadership to discipline, three, comradeship and for self respect. A fifth factor, devotion to cause must exist but need not necessarily influenced all the soldiers. Finally, there are numerous contributory factors which are of great importance but are not essential conditions. Starting with this first one. Leadership morale is in the first place based on leadership. Good morale is impossible without good leaders. Human beings are fundamentally a lichen that certain common characteristics apply to all men in varying degrees in battle. The most important of these characteristics is fear. All men are afraid at one time or another to a greater or lesser extent. In moments of fear, they band together and look for guidance. They seek for a person to give decisions. They look for a leader,

Speaker 3:          00:38:33       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:38:34       The leaders power

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       of decision results from his ability to remain calm in the crisis. His greatest asset is the ability to act normally in abnormal conditions, to continue to think rationally when his men have ceased to think, to be decisive in action when they are paralyzed by fear, a little bit of normal face from Monte abnormally in abnormal conditions remain calm

Speaker 1:          00:39:09       back to the book. The object of training must be first to select those who possess them within them. The potentiality is of leadership and secondly, to develop these potential realities. This is accomplished by giving the leader responsibility. The leader's character will develop in proportion to the responsibility with which he has been entrusted. Trusted.

Speaker 1:          00:39:29       So there you go. He's saying the same thing that we just were talking about earlier. You have certain potentials and you got to develop those. And how do you develop them with people? You give people, you want to develop leaders, you give him responsibility. You don't give him responsibility that's going to kill them, but you give him responsibility that's gonna definitely test them and they're going to have to step up to be able to perform back to the book. That two vital attributes of a leader are a decision, inaction and be calmness in crisis. Given these two attributes of key will succeed without them, he will fail our great problem in pieces to select leaders. It's just select as leaders, men whose brain will remain clear when intensely frightened. So from Monte, you gotta remain calm. Hmm. Now he's going to talk about discipline. The object of discipline is the conquest of fear. There are two aspects of fear. Fear can suddenly attack a man through his imagination, a corpse in a ditch or a grave. By the SARC far side of the road will remind him of his position. He will suddenly realize that he himself is liable to be killed. It is a function of discipline to fortify the mind so that'd becomes reconciled to unpleasant sites and accepts them as normal everyday occurrences.

Speaker 1:          00:40:59       Fear can also creep upon a man during periods of monotony on the line. At such time, he will have the opportunity to appreciate the dangers which beset his life. Fear acting through his thoughts can so reduce the man's hardcore of courage that he will become nervous and fearful. Discipline strengthens the mind so that it becomes impervious to the corroding influence of fear. It teaches men to confine their fought within certain definite limits. You didn't steals the habit of self control. That's pretty amazing. It's pretty amazing assessment to think that the one of the best premier tools to overcome fear as discipline. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:41:48       Back to the book. Discipline implies a conception of duty. Nothing will be accomplished in the crisis by the man without a sense of duty. Makes Sense. Now he's going to talk about comradeship. Back to the book. Morale can not be good unless men come to have affection for each other. A fellow feeling must grow up, which will result in a spirit of comradeship. And Army is made of human beings so that however much a leader may inspire as men, however perfect the discipline, the morale will be hard and unsympathetic if the warmth of comradeship has not been added.

Speaker 1:          00:42:30       Oh yeah, you gotta be, you gotta be the hardcore disciplinarian, but you need the warmth of comradeship. Back to the book war though hard business is not necessarily a grim one. Men must laugh and joke together, must enjoy each other's company, company and must get fun out of even life. I must get fun out of life even in times of danger. So do you want to have a good time? Yes you do. And the thing that makes these dangerous times more bearable is when you're having fun during them. And that's one of the things that you're, I don't talk a whole lot about seal training in here on the podcast, but one of the things that you do in seal training is you're doing miserable things cold, wet, tired. And you're having fun the whole time you're learning that, hey, guess what? I can sit here and be cold and it's miserable.

Speaker 1:          00:43:27       Or I can be cold and I can laugh about it and I can make fun of my friend. The way he's shivering. That's what makes it bearable. And the same thing happens when you get overseas and you joke about really dark things, you know, dark sense of humor that comes out real strong when you're overseas. And one of my, one of my buddies who was super paranoid, I've talked about them on here before the guys, the guys found a tube that had shipped like maps or something. And if you pulled the tube apart real fast, it sounded like a mortar law of mortar launch. And so they'd get outside is 10 and he was super paranoid. We, we spent a little bit of time getting mortared and so he was a little on edge from that. Yeah. So they'd go outside of his tent, you know, and you can hear through the 10 it's just a little piece of fabric and they go outside of his tent and they'd pull that thing and it would sound like a mortar through Qut freaky, you know, what the hell are you cross doing?

Speaker 1:          00:44:25       Or you know, at first you hear him like fall and like say hit the ground and then you'd hear the giggling of the guys and then you'd hear him cussing everyone out. But uh, yeah, but it was fun. It was funny too far. A little too far maybe. But everyone's having a good time and even him, you know, we'd get done and he would be come outside, you guys are bastards and we'd laugh about it. That's the kind of thing where you're, you've got to have fun in these tough situations. Yeah, that makes sense. That's probably why, you know, like nowadays, like Contemporary Company, they in court, like Jade's company, frack mom, take up foosball, ping pains. I heard, I heard massive noises of the other day and I was kind of sounded like like a mortar fire and wasn't quite mortar fire, but there was something, I didn't know what it was and they were, they were in a, in a nerf gun firefighters.

Speaker 1:          00:45:17       And by the way, it was sloppy. Like no one knew what they were doing. Yeah. There was no cover and move happening. It was just all, every man for himself. I was pretty disappointed. What the fuck? The reason, right. Where it's not, I mean these are, I mean conceptually it's the same thing. Obviously it's way different. It's way different, but it's not actually not right when you're going through tough things in a business and our company, we have fun with it. And when I work with companies that are good, good companies and they're going through something tough, the ones that have good morale, the ones that are laughing, they're the ones that do better. Who wants to go to work if you don't enjoy the people you work with, you know, like why would you want to do that? You know, one of the, one of the, uh, I hate even calling it the worst job, but I was the animal's age, right?

Speaker 1:          00:46:03       So every day I'm wearing a uniform, I'm in sitting at a desk all day. I did it for 13 months. It was just that part of it. It's, it's, you know, even it's just a miserable job. Right. Luckily, first of all, the animal is a great guy and I had a lot of, you know, we, I joked around all the time with him and his executive assistant is a guy that I would literally not, I would go two or three weeks at a time and we wouldn't say one serious thing to each other. I just, everything would be some joke about every, all the misery that we were going through and my misery. I just mean, you know, hours worth of meetings and traveling all the time and he'd been on the road and staying and crappy hotels and flights getting bumped and canceled and being held over in the, the animals suitcase, not showing up somewhere and he's supposed to go on stage.

Speaker 1:          00:46:52       It doesn't have a uniform with them. And like that's, you know, not fun. But guess what I had found the whole time and we'd be joking about, you know, I'd say, well I guess I'm going to get take, take one and again for the team and we'd be just laughing. So yeah, even in these situations that aren't fun at have you gotta have fun with them and that definitely will help out your morale. And if you're in a leadership position and all you do is just bare, you know, get, get drown in the misery that you're going through. Every single person that's with you is going to be going through the same thing. And so as a leader you got to, once again, going back to the dichotomy of leadership, you gotta have, you gotta know when, okay, the guys were under too stress. They're not having fun.

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       I need to have fun. I need to start a nerf war in the, in the office here. So guys loosen up and then there's times where hey guys are having too much fun. We got to tighten them up. Yeah, yeah. Like, hey guys, we got this to do. And so you got to ride that, that line in balance it out correctly. Yeah. Yeah. It's cool. Hall like newer companies that were companies nowadays there are incorporating that element into the, the actual co, you know you're right. And there's companies nowadays that do it too much and all of a sudden they can't get anything done. Yeah they're messing around because everyone's playing ping pong. Right. Everyone's in the Lego room cause they got rooms now where it's like oh you could go in there and think and do play with legos cause that relaxes your mind I guess.

Speaker 1:          00:48:12       Not me when I'm around lake goes I think I'm going to step on them. Sorry cause I got kids stepped on late. Legos is a nightmare. So I don't like being around Legos. I got the PTSD from Lego stepping when I was glad my kids were younger. Lego, you know, cause you can't ever get your son enough legos apparently. Correct. Cause they just need everything. And when I was a kid there was not that many different types of Legos. You had blocks, long ones and shorter ones. Nowadays you get Lego's but they have hands and horderves and machine guns and they got cool stuff but they ain't Lego's anymore. They're little toys but they still come with the little legos and they still hurt the bottom stuff on. They are surprisingly sharp for kids. Made your choice major sharp. All right, going back to the book, he's the other thing you talked about self respect and no man can be said to possess high morale if the quality of self respect is lacking and this is something that Dick Winters talked about too, that self respect and and how that drove him. Soldiers must be encouraged to respect themselves at all times and under all conditioned. Self respect implies a determination to maintain personal standards of behavior. A man who respects himself will allow neither himself to become slovenly nor has quarters dirty. Even in action. He will take care to see that his personal appearance suffers as little as possible. It is the job of the noncommissioned officer to maintain this aspect of discipline. It is the function of the officer to encourage and instill self respect.

Speaker 2:          00:49:47       So

Speaker 1:          00:49:49       interesting. He breaks that down a little bit. Like I was talking about. If I'm the senior guy and I'm around yelling at people about how they're looking, that's not good. That should be my subordinate leadership should be tightened in that stuff up.

Speaker 2:          00:50:01       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:50:07       no. Okay. Here's this conclusion. Again, this is Monte talking. In brief, high morale has been defined as the quality which makes men ender and show courage in times of fatigue and danger. The cultivation of morale depends on the training of leaders and of discipline. The encouragement of comradeship and the infusing of self respect. The leaders must have a belief in their cause and they must pay attention to numerous contributory factors of considerable but secondary importance. We live today in a scientific age, but we soldiers have to remember that the raw material in which we have to deal is men. Man is still the first weapon of war. His training is the most important consideration in fashioning of a fighting army. All modern science is directed towards his assistance, but on his efforts depends the outcome of the battle. The morale of the soldier is the most important single factor in war. So there is Monte, and that's, that can be said for just about any organization, what your organization is made up with his people. And you know, you hear that with businesses all the time. Our people, our most important assets, that's generally going to be the case. Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:51:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:43       Here's some, now we get into the leadership, the actual leadership section. Interesting. Again, they start off with morale. That's the first chapter. Now they move into leadership and you know, clearly from what he just said, Morales, the most important thing and winning battle. I don't agree. I think leadership is the most important thing. Now. His number one is number one. Uh, factor in good morale is leadership. So I guess, you know, you could see where we're coming from a different angle, but my, my font is a little bit different. My thought is the most important thing is leadership. And I think that leadership covers other things. Just be besides the morale of the men, because now we're talking about the strategies that you're using, the tactics that you're using. Everything is covered by leadership, including morale. Yeah. So you guys are looking at it from not opposite, but just varying perspectives where he thinks leadership is part of morality. You think morale started leadership? Yes. I think you have identified the situation correctly. All right. Here's some more from Monte on leadership. I would define leadership as the will to dominate together with the character, which inspires confidence.

Speaker 2:          00:52:54       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:52:54       A leader has got to learn to dominate the events would surround him. He must never allow these events to get the better of him. He must allow nothing to divert him from his aim. He must always be on top of his job and be prepared to accept responsibility. So Montes, talking about ownership. Now what I have to caveat this with is you get these people that are single minded, right? And that they're going to dominate everything that's going on around them. And they do that from a tactical perspective, not from a strategic perspective. So, for instance, if you say, um, I must never, or I must dominate the events which surround me and must allow nothing to divert me from my aim, that can actually be problematic if it doesn't make strategic sense. Right? So if I'm always worried about dominating everything that's going on around me and the thing that's going on around me isn't really that important, I'm wasting my time on it. Yeah. So this has to, this has to be sort of offset a little bit by the dichotomy of leadership, which is, yes, you want to dominate what's going on, but if what's going on isn't important, you need to let it go. You need to just let it go a little bit.

Speaker 2:          00:54:10       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:54:13       All right, so now we're going to hear from Jen. And by the way, this book, what this book serve to lead, it's, it's basically a bunch, I should have said this in the beginning, but it's, it's a bunch of small excerpts, bigger than quotes. Some of them are just quotes, which I don't do a bunch of like, hey, just reading quotes. I'd do a couple, I'm going to do a couple of today, but some of them are like, you know, two, three, four pages of people's views on leadership, of which I'm pulling out some of the highlights. And interestingly, for the first time I was going through some of this and I was like, you know what? I'm actually, it was something that I've, it's something that I've said a million times. And so I said, you know what, I'm not actually going to highlight this again because I've said it over and over again.

Speaker 1:          00:54:59       Now, clearly with discipline, I just talked about it for 47 minutes and I probably always will when I get the opportunity, but there's a lot more about discipline as a whole section on discipline. We'll get to, all right, now we're going to talk, we're gonna hear from General John Hackett again, a World War II African campaign as part of market garden, which is the big airborne operation, the World War II than here's what he says. I am a soldier. In speaking of leadership, I do so as a soldier and when I think about it as any soldier often must I do so in the context of battle

Speaker 1:          00:55:37       pressures in battle are high and in battle. As a consequence, the problems of leadership stand out in bold relief and that's something very similar to watch what I say, which is combat is like life amplified and intensified wrote that an extreme ownership and that's what I'm talking about. And because it's that way, it's very easy to identify what's going on with the leadership. It's a very, the problems of leadership stand out in bold relief. He said it better than me back to the book, but while battle may be unique, the problems that it exposes our not

Speaker 2:          00:56:14       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:56:15       right? Yes. Leadership problems and had been working for seven years with other companies and people that are not to battle. And guess what the problem is that battle exposes are not unique to battle for leadership is concerned with getting people to do things and is most keenly needed when difficulties, doubts and dangers or at their greatest in whatever sphere this is attempted. The problems are essentially similar. So anytime you've got a team, you've got to try and make him do something. The problems are pretty much going to be similar. Back to the book I said that leadership was concerned with getting people to do things. What I meant was getting them to do things a willingly. So we don't want to just bark orders at people that doesn't work. Doesn't work in business, doesn't work on the battlefield. Will it work for five minutes? Yes it will. Will I get, I yell at you and get you to do something. Yeah, sure. You're right on monster.com looking for a new job and then you get home.

Speaker 3:          00:57:19       Yup.

Speaker 1:          00:57:22       Back to the book of Man really only gets a full response from the men. He leads by something approaching complete fusion of his own identity with the hole that he and they together form. So think about that. If you're in charge of something and you're a leader, you need to become that thing. You need to become that team. You need to become that goal. I liked that one. And you can see when people get possessed. Like you look at the modern business leaders today, those are people that, you know, Steve Jobs, he was like obsessed with the product that he was apple. And that's one of those things that was so beneficial. Ilan mosque just like he is what he's trying to do. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:58:08       Back to the book, successful military leadership is impossible without the leaders total engagement in the task in hand and to the group committed to his care for its discharge. And what's interesting about that, I was talking to your brother, uh, Jade Charles, I'm not too long ago actually. It was pretty long ago. And He, and he said something to me and it was like a big revelation to him and he was very, is a very, he had a good way of saying with what I'm just reading about right now. We were talking about something, he was going to a meeting and he was going to be, you know, talking about something. There was some controversy about where they were going to go and, and he said that the person that cares the most wins. And that's a great statement. It's very true. It's not a hundred percent true, but the percentage is very high up there because if I just care about something so much and I'm going to drive with it further than you if I care about this decision more than you do.

Speaker 1:          00:59:13       Yeah. I got a really good chance of winning really good chance of winning. Yeah. Couldn't seem to like that translates into any. Yeah, and he'd go more. You care about it. The more probability. Yeah. I guess the only, the only place where it becomes problematic is if I, uh, I care about something, you know, at 97, level 97 and you care about with the opposite decision, you're also at level 97. Oh Dang. Now we've got an issue. Now we've got a problem because we're both going to think we're going to win and we both believe that we need to win. So now it's going to, going the distance. Now we got an ego scenario going on and things become problematic and, and you know where this just becomes stupid as in the, when you hear people having political, I would use an air quotes on that one.

Speaker 1:          01:00:00       Political debates around something. Yeah. You know, and this person totally believes 100% and this person totally cares 100% and they're going to go nuts on each other and they don't listen to anything that the other person says. And you ended up with a big disaster on your hands of nonsense. A lot of those, whether it be political diet, that's another one. Yeah, I know. I was listening, I was listening to our podcast. Sure ain't worries. And what we were talking about, we were talking about, I was talking about watching people in the news and that's a classic situation where you know, you got somebody on a three minute segment and one person is DB, you know the hardcore this direction. The other person is the hardcore and the other direction. They both care. They both care a lot. Neither one of them is going to win.

Speaker 1:          01:00:46       They actually, that that goes the next, that's the next realization is that if you're going up against person that cares as much as you do, you actually have to take a back step and find another way. You have to flank them. Yeah. Cause you're not going to be able to win them by going head to head they care or is it equal to you and you've got to find a new solution. Otherwise, you know what you'll do, expend all your ammunition, charging machine, gun nests and you'll die that you don't want to do that. If you care as much as me and I don't have the same opinion, I've got to flank you. Yeah. A lot of these probably going to let you think. You just won the argument in order to flank you too, by the way. Yeah. Yeah. The um, again, political religion, diet, how to raise kids, you know, all of these are all hot button.

Speaker 1:          01:01:32       Is that what you call it? Things that you're not supposed to talk to or talk about around the Thanksgiving dinner together, they get heated real quick. Then you, and a lot of times we're talking about, you know, people are not people, but we've talked about how much someone cares about it, right? A lot of times the things they get mixed up is how much you care about it versus how much you care about your stance on it. Any different but and, and different. And then you've got to put your ego into both of those. Because my ego, I don't want to admit that I'm wrong, right? That was still to do. That means you care about your stance. So when you make it by yourself, but if you care about the issue, like if I, if I, if me and you were having a debate about kettle bell workouts or something, I like dumbbells Kettlebell, but I really care about the issue and the issue is what's the best, right?

Speaker 1:          01:02:19       If I truly care about the what, the best exercises and not about my stance on what the big w I'm going to care about the real answer, read that. Whether it's my answer or not. So that's why I think like political, all these other things, they have the end. It is, it's just like how you said it's the ego natural thing, but they wind up carrying more about their stance on it. Then they do the actual issues, you know for sure. Don't let that happen and watch out for that one. So yeah, the [inaudible] 96 [inaudible] 97 but the, the person who cares the most wins doesn't apply to someone's individual stance on something. It applies to subject. And it also doesn't apply to, you know, a Jujitsu match. Cause I might really care about winning. I was thinking about this the other day, cause that's another thing people say mental, oh it's all mental.

Speaker 1:          01:03:05       And here's an example. Alex Honnold, who's a rock climber who just climbed El Capitan in Yosemite, which is 3000 feet tall. And you people say, oh, it's all mental. And, and people say things, you know, if you want something bad enough, you can do it. You put me on that rock, there's a some crux move like 2000 feet up, 2000 feet up. That's really hard. And you're smearing, which is this technique and rock climbing where you don't, and I've done it before and I'm like the lowest white belt. I'm not even a white belt. And like I like someone gave me my white belt in rock climbing or you, I'm not, I'm not like a legit, but I know I've tried things. I go to Yosemite and I'll play around on the rocks and everything, but I've tried this thing, it's called smearing and, and you're basically just using the tread or just the bottom of your rock climbing shoes on flat granted.

Speaker 1:          01:03:57       And you can create enough friction that you can, you can move up it and some people are really good at it. I suck. And you know, you've got to have, you've got your hand holds your work and to, but you're using your feet and it's this really weird balance that you have to do because if you push too hard and the rocks, they, your feet slip off. And if you don't push hard enough, you don't get any lift. So it's this really fine like balance you've got to have. And apparently there's one move or this one series of moves on this climb that he did that you see, you have to smear it. Of course, this is very natural for him, but apparently he climbed that section with a rope like six or seven times just to make sure it felt good and all that stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:04:43       Here's my point. Even if it wasn't a smear print, even if he was just holding on to rocks right at 2000 feet, I would absolutely want really, really badly to hold onto the rocks. I don't have the muscular strength to do it. I mean the things that he's holding on to our smaller than will, the first pad of your fingers. That's what he's holding onto a tiny, and we were doing this the other day at my house, remember? Yup. That little thing, you actually had bet had stronger grip than me on the, on the climbing board that I have at my house, but I could, I could couldn't even hold on or I could hold on for five seconds. And you like had no, it did you hold on to the really small one? Yeah. Yeah, that's legit. I can't even hold on to that thing.

Speaker 1:          01:05:26       So if I was 2000 feet up and I really, really, really, really, really, really wanted to do it, and I was all mentally in the game, guess what? I'm falling into my deaf because I don't have the strength to do it. I don't have the physical strength and I need to build it and okay. You could say, and that might be an acceptable answer. Okay. If you really have the mental strength and will to do it, then you'll trade train super hard. But at that moment, not gonna help me, I'm falling to my death. Right. Yeah. I think that's not a metaphor, but like, uh, it's, it's like it's me. Yeah. That would be, oh yeah, it's a romantic thing. Yeah. You want it bad enough you can do it. No, actually not true. I want to do, I want to take the extreme version.

Speaker 1:          01:06:10       I want to stay alive. I'm 2000 feet up. I want really badly to stay alive. It doesn't matter. I can't get across that section. I can't, don't have the hand strength to do it. Not happening, but they're making a movie about that. I can't wait to see it. About Alex Honnold climbing that rock. Jimmy Chin is the famous kind of photographer guy that they went and documented the whole thing and apparently one of the articles said that during that crux moment, Alex Honnold was like, Hey, when we get to here, just like back off with the cameras. He apparently was like, ain't no, just back off the cameras when I go through, you know, section 94 alpha, because I think he thought he didn't need any cameras around real close when he might fall to his death.

Speaker 1:          01:06:55       It's that heavy. Yeah, like W W we'll or is it because it might break his concentration or both? I Dunno. I Dunno, but that's crazy. Have you ever been Yosemite? No, it's, it's El Capitan is 3000 feet straight up of granted it takes people three, four, five days to climb up it. He climbed it and three hours and 45 minutes with a chalk bag and a pair of shoes. It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous. It's completely ridiculous. 3000 feet. That's very tall echo. You're trying to imagine it. Let me help. No, I'm taller than anything you've ever seen. It's taller than, than a skyscraper in San Diego. It's huge and he climbed it with no ropes. That means there's no rest. That means there's no break and it means there's no mistakes. You can't make a mistake if you make a mistake, you die. Yeah. Crazy. Very impressive.

Speaker 1:          01:07:54       I don't even know why we're talking about Alex Honnold right now. Oh, because we're talking about the mental will. Whoever believes that the most. Yeah. Whoever believes the most wins cares about it. Sorry. I don't believe in as much as I care about staying alive, I wouldn't be able to pull it off. Yeah. I think in jade situation that it did make sense though. You know, cause you're, you know, actually that does make sense. It does make sense. And that's why I was able to do a lot of stuff that I've been able to do in my career. When I was in the military, a lot of the stuff that I was able to get done, I was able to get done because I cared about it more than anybody else. You think you're going to, you know, you think you're going to outperform my task unit.

Speaker 1:          01:08:36       I care about this so much. I don't care. I care about this so much. You're not gonna be able to compete with me because you might think, oh, I'll get there at five o'clock in the morning. I've been there for an hour. You might think I'm going to have my guys drill this 10 times. I'm gonna have my guys drill it 20 times. I care about this too much for you to win. You can't beat me. You can't beat me. It's not going to happen. I care about this too much. Not in a bad way. Not in a selfish way. I care about this. I love this. This is everything to me. You don't know. You have other things going on and you got your wife and you got your family and you've got this other thing going on in your life and you got goals that you want.

Speaker 1:          01:09:10       I don't care about any of those things. This is all I care about, so therefore you can't compete with me. And that's pretty cool. It's a cool place to be, right and get overseas. People aren't thinking about all these other things now. You don't care about anything. I don't care about anything else. This is the only thing I care about. So it ends up getting boiled down to just not stopping. Right? Not quitting, not giving up. Yeah. That definitely plays a role. That definitely plays a role. I am, of course, there's gotta be balanced because if, let's say, I don't care about, let's say, you know, my, my focus is 100% my seal task unit, but then I forget about the fact that we're working with our other army units. The only thing I care about is my unit. Well, no, actually I need to care about the mission more.

Speaker 1:          01:09:52       Right? I need to care about our strategic, where we're going strategically. Because otherwise I'm thinking, I just want to get my guys taken care of. I just want to get my guys more work. I just want to get, no, actually I, I do what care. What trumps might care for. The task unit was care for the mission of what we're trying to accomplish. Now luckily those two things are completely aligned. So there was never any time where I was thinking, oh, should I do this to benefit the task and or benefit the mission? No, no. If it benefited the mission to benefit the task unit, if it benefited the task and your benefit benefited the mission period. So I care about those things. Begin to have a hard time competing with me. And luckily in Ramadi, there wasn't any competition. We were all working together. That's what was so amazing about it was army Marine Corp us, everyone was just working together to accomplish missions. Cause that's what you get when you get a nasty battlefield. You get people working together. All right, another piece. This is a guy named general mom. Sell. War is preeminently the art of the man who dares to take the risk of the man who thinks deeply and clearly of the man who when accident intervenes is not there by cast down, but changes his plants and disposition with the readiness of a resolute and reflective mind which so far as is possible has foreseen and provided against difficulties. There you go. That's what we're talking about. Oh, accident intervenes. Cool. Good. Yeah. I'm not cast down. Change plants adapt.

Speaker 2:          01:11:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:11:33       Back to the book. No. Now no man can inspire confidence in others who is not confident in himself and self confidence comes from knowledge. A thorough understanding of modern weapons and organization tactics and the details administration affecting all those under his command must therefore be acquired by every leader. He must show his troops that he can plan, sound, be lead resolutely and deal promptly and effectively with the unexpected. In addition to gain full confidence of his troops, a leader must have their personal friendship and trust.

Speaker 2:          01:12:10       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:12:10       I like that. Again, I've, there was a, there was a seal officer that once was briefing guys and said, Hey, if, if your guys, if your, if your people like you, they then they, uh, you're not doing a good job. Yeah, not true. He's actually saying they need your trust and personal friendship and trust. Yeah. Once you seen something like that, that even that you can't push that too far. Well, of course bounce dichotomy of leadership. You can't be such close friends that you're choosing that you're putting one person as more important than the mission or the team. That's the dichotomy of leadership.

Speaker 2:          01:12:50       Thank God.

Speaker 1:          01:12:54       Okay. Now he puts together this list, which yeah, we're, we're, we're feeling pretty good about this one. A short list to leadership given as follows. Perfect. Your military knowledge study, the use of weapons. They're tactical handing the enemy's character and methods and way to make use of ground. So I don't care what job you're in. Apply those, right? No. Your tools. No the enemy. Know your competitor. Next, study the men under your command. Know them well and be known to them. Gain their confidence by your knowledge, energy, and skill, and by your interest in their welfare. Always be cheerful with them. However, you may feel, teach yourself to think out. Reason. Depreciation's leading to clever but uncomplicated plans quickly and unhurriedly so there you go. Keep things simple. Know your people. Get the I like it, says. Know your people. Get them to know you too. That's important. Next study methods of deception and make full use of them. Always aim at misleading the enemy. Always seek surprise. Keep your object clearly before you concentrate your efforts and resources at the decisive point. Always think well ahead.

Speaker 2:          01:14:13       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:14:14       prioritize and execute. Work out the best methods of control, different tactical situations. Practice them constantly. Study the situation carefully. Don't waste any time. Make up your mind and stick to it. Get out your orders quickly. Make certain that everyone clearly knows what you intend it to be done. Commander's intent. Maintain the initiative. Make opportunities and seize them at once. I liked that. Make opportunities. Boy, do I like that. Don't wait for them to come. Be prepared to take risks, but don't be foolhardy. No, your commanders intentioned and act in accordance with it. Don't wait for orders. Inaction is always wrong, so there you go. Well, this is just reiterating things that I talk about all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:15:11       Never take counsel of your fears. Think of the enemy's difficulties and how you can take advantage of them. Remember that it is willpower that wins. Oh, he's, he's going off w not talking about caring. He's talking about will, which will goes along way, never relaxed your efforts until victory is won. Attend to the comfort of the troops before you think of your own. This is all just phenomenal stuff. Be loyal to your superiors and your subordinates. Express your views clearly and frankly, but when a decision has been reached, fully support it and stop all criticism. Never take shelter behind others when things for which you are responsible have gone wrong. Take some ownership. Oh, I like this one. Refrain from jealousy, resentment, and self seeking. Be Tactful. Never make friction. Be Thoughtful and considerate, but maintain from discipline. Think about how bad this thing about the dichotomy of that. Be Thoughtful and considerate, but maintain from discipline. Never ordered troops to do what you are not prepared to do yourself.

Speaker 1:          01:16:34       Never give an unnecessary order. That's a good one. Think about that one. Never give an unnecessary order and I'll tell you why I liked that one is because if you're doing a good job as a leader, orders should barely even be necessary. They should barely even be necessary. I talked about this with life the other day. I, I'm weak. I'm sure we could go back through, you know the history of tasking at bruiser, but as we were having a conversation, we were working with a company. I don't think I ever gave an order to either one of my two platoon commanders, either life or the Delta platoon commander. I don't think I ever said this is what you're going to do. That's an order like you see in the movies. Right. I'm going to ask you, they say that. Did they ever say that? You say in order if you yes, it can be set.

Speaker 1:          01:17:31       I'm trying to think. I'm sure it's been, I, I think it's been said to me before, no more like an Admin, like not administrative situation. Patch. I don't know if anyone's ever said it to me before, like that's an order. I don't know. I'm trying to think of, there's been some situation where someone said to me like, Hey, basically like you've pushed far enough Jocko stand down. Like I've gotten one of those before. Like, Hey, we get it Jocko, you care about this a lot. It's not happening to stand down. I've gotten some, especially got those when I was a little younger, like when I was a young enlisted guy, the driving with an id, I just be wanting to crush it and, and people would be kind of saying, Hey, well no we can't. And I'd be like, no, why can't, why can't we? Why, why, why, why? Why won't we do this? We need to do this. This is the smart thing to do. You know, what's the right thing to do? And I would just eventually get like the little, hey, stand down. We're not doing it. Okay. You know what I'm going to do, become an officer and wanna have to listen to you anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:18:27       So yeah, I've got, I think I've gotten a couple stand downs and my time 10 down. That's an order cause he had, that's an order that really, when you think about our, anyway, when I think about it, it really does seem like a movie line. Yeah. And when the thing is that means that you have not done a good job as a leader. If I have to say that's an order, that means I haven't done as good a job as a leader. That means you don't understand the mission. You don't understand the intent. You don't understand. I haven't conveyed it to you properly and the only way I can get you to listen to is by saying that's an order pulling rank. Yeah, pulling rank on you. That's not a good, not a good situation. Back to the book. Never overlook failure to carry one out. So it's never given unnecessary order. Never overlook failure to carry one out.

Speaker 2:          01:19:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:19:13       Some people will have to chime in with their opinions on that one. Never overlook failure to carry one out. I'm not sure on that one. What does that mean to carry one? That's what I'm saying. I don't know. It says, it says never ordered troops to do what? You're not prepared to do yourself. Never given unnecessary order. Never overlook failure to carry one out to carry out in order to carry one out. Never overlook failure to carry one out. I'm not sure what he means by that book. I'm sure some people will give us some opinions on that one. Yeah, on the Facebook you and I release keep fit yourself and make certain that your men do to keep your own nerves under control and study your men's

Speaker 2:          01:20:04       good

Speaker 1:          01:20:05       for like when you want to comment. If you're listening and you want to comment, you have an opinion on that one. Put It on the Facebook posts so it can follow the conversation as opposed to Twitter, which is 140 characters. You know what I mean? It's easier to see it on Facebook when there's a legit question or someone has some legit big feedback. If you put it on the thread for podcasts number 81, when I post it, that's the place to put in there in the replies when I can like converse back on that subject without having to go through 17,000 tweets and then go back and forth.

Speaker 1:          01:20:42       So it's all laid out on Facebook. So it's a good place to have those little conversations. Twitter, we have different kinds of conversations. Sure. Last of all, remember that success in war depends more than anything else on the will to win. Cool. Again, now we've got Monte saying Morales, the most important we got Jocko saying leadership is the most important and you got brigadier general month sell saying that the will to win is the most important. I'm not going to actually argue with either one of these guys. These guys were all uh, all kinds of experience. Much more intense than mine. Speaking of intense experience more than mine. There's a guy, a pseudonym, meaning a fake name Basil Lisc. And the guy wrote something called talks on leadership and the guy's actual name was Alfred burn and he was a world war one and World War Two veteran and he was a military historian and he's got a little section in here called the being straight.

Speaker 1:          01:21:56       There's one trait in the character of a leader that above all things really counts and it perhaps counts in war even more than in peace being straight. No amount of ability, knowledge or cunning can ever make up for not being straight. Once those under him find out that a commander is absolutely straight and all of his dealings with them and free from the slightest trade of self interest other than the self interest of which we are all guilty. When striving for victory of causes we believe to be right, they will love him as their leader, trust him, worked for him, follow him and should the occasion arise, die for him with the fundamental ability of the British soldier which comes to the surface when things are at their worst. So being straight with your people, very important, very important. In fact, perhaps his most important. Above all. So now we've got another factor. That's the most important thing. Now you're going to hear a little on leadership from Field Marshal Lord herring. Once again, World War One and World War II veteran,

Speaker 1:          01:23:16       he also fought in the second battle of Al Ameen. He was a wounded, lost some fingers recovered, got back to the fight. So he says about leadership here, there are some people who believe that leadership is something which is inborn or which you acquire automatically at a public school. But neither of those things are true. There are certain fundamental qualities which affect leadership in which depend to a very large extent on upbringing and the moral and spiritual values which you can learn what you learn in your family and in your environment as a young man. But there was no special way, nor is there any special caste or class which has the prerogative of leadership.

Speaker 1:          01:24:02       There are many forms of leadership. Political parties have their leaders, every big organization and industry or commerce all have their leaders. And at the other end of the scale, so do dance bands and so do gangs of thieves. And smugglers. There are many qualities that apply equally to every type of leader, but you and I are concerned with one particular type of leadership to my mind at the highest type of all and that is leadership on the battlefield and I believe it to be the highest type because it has to be exercised under conditions of great difficulty and considerable danger. I would like to be quiet. I would like you to be quite clear about the conditions under which you will have to exercise leadership. You will frequently be tired. You may also be cold and wet and hungry and thirsty. You may be dripping with sweat or you may be freezing with cold. You won't know precisely what is going on. You won't know exactly where the enemy is. You certainly won't know what he is going to do or what his capabilities are of doing anything. You may not know where your own people are or what they are going to do.

Speaker 1:          01:25:17       To put it briefly, you've got to be able to exercise leadership and conditions of fatigue and fear, uncertainty and ignorance and often in isolation. That is what makes it extremely difficult and that is why leadership on the battlefield calls in my view for the highest qualities, many qualities are required in leader. Different people have different views about which are more important. In my opinion, there are five outstanding mental and physical, moral and spiritual qualities without which you cannot hope to be successful and a good leader on the battlefield. The first of those qualities is a mental and physical one and that is fitness, absolute fitness of mind and body.

Speaker 3:          01:26:10       So

Speaker 1:          01:26:11       make sure you're getting your morning physical training in physical fitness, mental fitness. Next. Then I would say you've got to have complete integrity. You've got to be honest, not only with yourselves but with the menu lead and the people with whom you work and honesty and an integrity are things that you cannot compromise with. You cannot alter. If you do, you will lose confidence and you will not be able to lead. You must have complete integrity.

Speaker 3:          01:26:45       So

Speaker 1:          01:26:46       that's the same thing as being straight. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:26:52       Not after that.

Speaker 1:          01:26:54       Not In any next to, sorry. Next after that. Not In any order of priority, but this is how I have put them down deep in my mind. There is an enduring courage pretty well. Everyone can be brave for a few minutes. Most of us can if we steal ourselves to it. Take one pledge or make one decision or incur one risk, but the sort of courage you must have to lead on the battlefield is an enduring courage and one that you will go that will go on when other people falter. One that will enable you to do what you know to be right irrespective of the danger or the difficulty. Contrary, often contrary to the advice of well meaning friends,

Speaker 3:          01:27:38       so

Speaker 1:          01:27:40       gotta have courage. Next then you must have daring initiative. Initiative means doing right away what you might. If you had time, think of doing a few minutes later.

Speaker 3:          01:27:55       I like

Speaker 1:          01:27:55       this. If you wait for things to happen to you, they will happen. All right and here I am quoting the words of my predecessor also spoken here. They will happen to you but they won't be what you like and they certainly won't bring you success. Initiative means seeing at once and very quickly what needs to be done, making up your mind to do it and then seeing it through to the middle, a bitter end,

Speaker 3:          01:28:25       so I love that one.

Speaker 1:          01:28:28       If you wait for things to happen to you, they certainly will a little bit more on willpower here, then you must have undaunted willpower. The willpower is the motive power. It is what enables you to make yourself fit in mind and body to produce in you, in your heart. The courage, the enduring courage that I spoke of to give you the courage to do your duty and to make the sacrifice that may be called from you. It is the willpower that you to take the initiative, to make the plan, to do what is required to see through and that will power must be undaunted. It must never allow itself to be overcome or subdued. Perhaps the finest example living today of the power and influence for good of man. We've undaunted willpower as our prime minister. In one of the critical periods of the last war, he spoke certain words. I am going to quote you now. He said, all the great struggles in history have been won by superior willpower, resting victory in the teeth of odds or upon the narrowest of margins. It is the willpower that is superior that can rest victory and the teeth of odds. That is the type of willpower that has got to be developed in a leader on the battlefield.

Speaker 1:          01:30:00       Mobilize your will.

Speaker 2:          01:30:04       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:30:04       Now he talks about some other qualities. He talks about knowledge. He talks about judgment. He talks about Team Spirit's saying, because you cannot get success on the battlefield by yourself. You've got to work with other people, so obviously as a leader you have to have that spirit of teamwork and closing out. He says, there's one other thing I would like to say to you

Speaker 1:          01:30:35       as British officers, you will never have all you want. All you need, you'll be short of this or that or the other. Sometimes you will be short of men. Other Times your equipments are weapons may not be as good as you think they ought to be, nor will you have as many as you would like. You may be short of ammunition. You may also be sure to food and water or other necessary things when these circumstances arise as they do often throughout your service, both in peace and war, there's only one motto and that is to make certain that you do the very best you can with what you got. Don't belly gate about what you have not got, but get on and make certain you do your utmost with what you have got. Now, to sum up what I've tried to say this afternoon, I would like to put it like this first, keep fit, absolutely fit. Then be honest, honest with yourselves, and honest with those with whom you work. Then have courage and make it an enduring courage. Next, be bold. Be Daring, and when there is a choice, take the bold and daring course.

Speaker 1:          01:31:46       Make the very most of what you have got and never, never, never give in. Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:32:02       Do what you can with what you've got until you really liked the whole night. Yeah, yeah. Sometimes it's time to start dating me. All right,

Speaker 1:          01:32:14       next, there's a chapter in this book, which is called discipline, which makes me very happy. And again, I tried to censor myself from not just doing the entire chapter. Obviously you can buy this book if you want to see the whole thing. There's some great points. This first one is from field marshal Earl wave bell who was in the Bueler wars and he was in World War One and in World War II he lost his left eye in the battle of [inaudible]. So we're talking a warrior here that was went back for service. Here's what he said about discipline. Discipline is teaching, which makes a man do something which he would not unless he had learnt that it was the right, the proper, and the expedient thing to do. At its best, it is instilled and maintained by pride in one's self, in one's unit, in one's profession, only at its worst by fear of punishment. So he's talking, we want self discipline. We don't want impose discipline. That's what he's saying. You don't want, I don't want you doing this because you're scared of me. If you don't do what I tell you, I'm going to beat you. That's not what I want. I want you saying I'm going to do this because I want to do it. Here's a little something from Monte here and we're going to get some disagreements going. I'm going to disagree with Monte. Sorry. Monti wish you were here to defend yourself.

Speaker 1:          01:33:53       Okay. On Discipline Monte, the basis of training must be self-discipline. Cool. A man must learn to be the master of himself and to keep in subjection the bad qualities in his makeup. I love that self discipline can be developed by training and such things as conception of duty, self control, self respect, endurance and so on. We then have collective discipline and there's no doubt that the initial training in this subject is best carried out by drill. Men must be taught instinctively to obey orders, whatever they are. I do not believe men we'll fight to voluntarily for a cause without the iron bonds of discipline.

Speaker 1:          01:34:43       The best form of discipline is subordination of self for the benefit of the community. So I'm going to make some comments on those. Number one, when you saying that you should obey orders regardless of what they are, don't agree. I don't agree with that. I want my men to question my orders. I want them to, if I'm telling you them to do something that they don't think it's smart, I want them to question me. I want them to come up with them a better solution. That's how we're going to win the moral thing to write. Like to obey orders regardless. Oh yeah. Oh, for sure. For sure. I want my whole team to be, hey, if this is the wrong thing to do, we shouldn't be doing it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:35:31       Next, the other one he says here is he says that people won't fight for a cause without the iron bonds of discipline. I don't believe that that's true either. Hmm. And I think if you look at American history guys, the, we didn't have the strict level. Of course there's, there's discipline. Of course in the military I, there's imposed discipline in the military. But the things that people and all soldiers I have accomplished without strict imposed discipline is they've given their lives over and over and over thousands and thousands and thousands and hundreds of thousands of cases where men have given their lives. Not because, not because I said or because the leader said go into charge this machine gun nest. That's, that's not why they did it. They did it because they believed in the cause. So I don't agree with that one. I think that men will fight voluntarily for our cause.

Speaker 2:          01:36:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:36:28       Without the iron balance of discipline. And you know, when I think they do it, I think they do it when that causes freedom. So when the cause is freedom, I believe men, we'll fight without the bonds of discipline over them. Hmm. And

Speaker 1:          01:36:46       this idea that the best form of discipline is the subordination of self for the benefit of the community. I don't actually agree with that one either. I think the best form of discipline is when there is alignment in the discipline, the discipline for the team and the individual bring success and survival and freedom and when those things are aligned, that's when I think you get the finest form of discipline. Now he recovers a little bit from my criticism here. Sure, sure. And of course to everyone that is wondering why I'm sort of making fun of myself. It's pretty embarrassing to be sitting here and disagreeing with a guy like Monte, so please don't take me the wrong way. I'm just giving my opinion here that I'm in no way comparing my military knowledge with General Montgomery and he does say this, the basis of all discipline is self discipline, which this is beautiful. When I agree with that 100% this, this self discipline may come from within a person or may be imposed upon him from without. Don't agree. That'll only last a little while. Whatever it serves, its source eight involves the idea of self control and self restraint. That is true.

Speaker 1:          01:38:18       There is, I think it's called.

Speaker 2:          01:38:21       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:38:22       situational discipline I think. Or what does that could, I could have the expression wrong, but I think it is situational. Just meaning,

Speaker 2:          01:38:31       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:38:32       like if you're in a certain situation you'll have, you'll be really self disciplined, but once you get out, you're not, you know, like, um, I don't know. You ever, you ever watched what's the big, there's a show called the biggest loser. No. So that's the only people that are having weight problems. They go on a show, they get fed certain things and made to work out and they lose a bunch of weight and then they win the program and then when they go back home and they're not around that impose discipline. Right. They lose it. Right. That's my point. My point is that that imposed discipline, it works. While you have the input in they, they're watching you. What I would prefer is to have someone that makes out change in their mindset and develops self discipline right now. Sometimes you can get that from imposed discipline and you realize like you get shown the freedom that it discipline gives you and then you carry on with it.

Speaker 1:          01:39:29       Like a lot of people that listen to the podcast and they've done incredible things with their lives because we weren't there to impose discipline on them, but they recognize themselves. Maybe they said, okay, you know what, I'm going to get up for the next two weeks and gonna get up early. I'm going to workout, I'm going to eat healthy. Two weeks go by, they've lost a little bit of body fat, they've gained a little bit of muscle and they feel good. Right? And all of a sudden they realize the benefits of discipline and so they changed their mindset and they become more disciplined human beings. Yeah. That's what I like when I don't like is it all run a bootcamp on you and yell at you and screaming, but that's another thing people want me to yell and scream. I get that. I think once or twice a day someone will say, you need to make an alarm clock where you'd yell and tell us to tell me to get out of bed.

Speaker 1:          01:40:14       I said good psychological warfare, but I'm not going to yell and psychological warfare because yelling isn't an effective tool compared to actually speaking to someone and letting them understand why it's important. Yeah. That's the preferred tool. Occasionally. Do you got to yell at people occasionally? Yes. You do. Okay. Usually not very often though. Yeah. That's pretty rare, Huh? But yeah, the yeah, you're right. Hub with that situational discipline. Cause even I think about what's worse. Somebody yelling at you or someone whispering, it's you. It's actually worse, isn't it? Some ways. In a lot of ways, yeah. To me it's worse. Sure. Yelling and screaming does, doesn't know. And it really doesn't

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       really matter what they're saying either if he choose yelling or whispering. Cause like, you know, even if they're telling you a normal thing like, hey, I'm here. This is what I want from the store. I want Avocados, tomatoes, and you know, some wine. But what if I whisper it to you? Hey chuck, come here bro. That my freak me out. Actually he may give me something. Yeah. Yeah. So it did exist. No, no, you get that. That's the point. It doesn't really matter what they're saying with Spring versus, he definitely has a different psychological effects for sure. Cause that's definitely freaks me out. Hey Jack, we didn't pick up a bottle of wine. No, actually I can. I'm leaving. Yeah, the wine kind of makes it extra awkward for sure.

Speaker 1:          01:41:37       All right, so now we get into another part on discipline right here. And this is Sir John Four to skew and what you pay attention to this one because when we start going sideways, I have in my mind rather those excellent but generally unthinking persons who shrink with horror from the idea of a man's abdicating his civil rights. What they say a man must obey even an unjust command under pain. It may be of death. It is monstrous for purposes of civil life, it might be monstrous, but not for the purposes of implicit obedience, which is the thing that matters in the army. Let there be justice as far as possible by home means. But as a general principle, it is better for an army that an injustice should be done than that in order should be disobeyed. This however, is an argument that cannot appeal to our, to our imaginary objector because he has red, no military history.

Speaker 1:          01:42:45       So that's just very disturbing. This whole thing. And it's really doesn't comply with anything that I say, which is I want you to question orders and if they're not good orders that you shouldn't obey him. And he said, no, no, no, it's better to do something unjust as long as you are obeying orders. And I get a little bit of research about John Four to skew and you know, obviously I don't agree with this. And actually in the new version of the book, He, the, the guy that writes the forward to the new version of this specifically calls out John Four to skew and says, we removed him the him, these were gone from the book. And what I found out about him was yes, he was in the army, he was a major in the army. Um, but I don't think he was in any combat.

Speaker 1:          01:43:34       And what I do know is that he was the royal librarian from 1905 until 1926 and he died in 1923 so he didn't go to World War One. All these other guys are World War One, World War II veterans. He was the like the Royal Librarian. And it's interesting when he says because he has red, no military. He hasn't said cause he's never been in combat before. He says he's ready. The person that would object to this has never read military history. Well Yeah Uri. Yeah, he's going with the theory. Yeah. And, and if you want to take this and stretch it out more broadly, this attitude, you know, I hate World War One. I hate world war one because it was so based on obedience and you are going to charge, we're going to charge this trench. All 7,000 of us are going to charge tomorrow morning at zero six 30 where to go over the top.

Speaker 1:          01:44:33       We're going to get mowed down by machine guns and then the people are going to follow us. And do the same thing. And they, they've guys were so obedient and brave and just selfless to do that. But this attitude is what made that war so devastating because no one said, hey, wait a second. This doesn't seem smart to me. Yeah, I just watched, you know, two, three, four battalions are two, three, four regiments get mowed down and now you're telling me I'm going to do the same thing tomorrow with my men? No, I want you to question my orders. I want you to say no. If I'm making you do something that doesn't make sense, I want you to say no. And if I can't explain it to you in a logical way, then I should rethink what I'm saying to you. Hmm. So Mr. John Ford Askew, we're going to have to say that we've got to change our opinion on, on obedience. And there are more important things than obedience in a team, in a military team and in the business world.

Speaker 1:          01:45:49       Here's another piece from this is going back to General Williams slim. Any army without discipline as no more than a mob alternating between frightened sheep and beasts of prey discipline as the British soldiers demonstrated in peace and war is the old Christian virtue of unselfishness, of standing by your neighbor, your comrade. It is the sacrifice of a man's comfort, inclination, safety, even life for others, for something greater than himself. It is the refusal to be the weak link in the chain that snaps under under strain, and this is a great little story here. One paragraph back to the book. Once from the safety of a well dug command post, I looked down on a battery of our artillery inaction in the African Bush. It was firing at five rounds per gun per minute, and ideally I the nearest gun in that area. The enemy unfortunately had complete local air supremacy and guns, unless engaged in some vital tasks, were ordered to remain silent whenever hostile aircraft appeared gradually dominating all other sounds came the dull drone of bombers flying low.

Speaker 1:          01:47:12       But the guns went on firing five rounds per gun per minute for they were supporting an infantry attack covered move. By the way, the first stick of bombs fell around the gun. I was watching some of his crew were hit. The dry brush roared into flame, which spread instantly to the camouflage nets over the gun. It vanished from my site and smoke and flame. Yet from the very midst of that inferno at the exact intervals came the flash and thud of the firing gun. Five rounds per minute per gun, never falter, never a second out, no weak link there. The discipline held.

Speaker 1:          01:48:15       That's pretty awesome sections here talking about duty and service and we're going to first start with Colonel George Henderson, a British officer who fought in Egypt and at the battle of Kasasa and he fought in the bueler awards as well, and he talks about Waterloo. Here we go. Back to the book. No incident is more familiar in our military history. Then the stubborn resistance of the British line at Waterloo truth. The long hours of the mid Summer Day, silent and immovable squares and squadrons stood in the trampled corn, harassed by an almost incessant fire of candidate and musketry to which they were forbidden to make reply. Not a moment, but heard some cry of agony. Not a moment, but some comrade fell head long into the furrows. Yet as bullets of the skirmishers hailed around them and the great shot tore through the tight packed ranks, the word was passed quietly close in on the center men and as the sun near its setting, the regiments still shoulder to shoulder stood fast upon the ground they had held at noon. The spectacle is characteristic in good fortune and in ill. It is rare indeed that a British regimen does not hold together and this indestructible cohesion, best of all qualities that an armed body can possess is based not merely on hereditary resolution, but on mutual confidence and mutual respect. The man and the ranks has implicit faith in his officer, the officer, and almost unbounded belief in the valor and discipline of his men.

Speaker 1:          01:50:33       And that I've talked about this and people want to know what makes the seal teams do well. The thing that makes the seal teams do well is the bond that holds them together. And that bond is so strong that it's unbreakable. And that's why seals do well in combat because we have a bond that is unbreakable, stronger than anything that's going to get thrown at us. The Brotherhood is going to stand. Hey, I'm gonna close this book out with two more quotes. And speaking of Waterloo, this one is from Wellington

Speaker 1:          01:51:16       and this is a very simple quote. He said, my rule was always to do the business of the day in the day. And I, I was reading this book the other day and I actually posted something about it, but I, I, I was, I didn't realize I was thinking about this, but we have a saying in the seal teams plan your dive and dive your plan is the saying. So when you're, when you're doing a combat swimmer attack, which is when you're on a rebreather and you're diving underwater and what are, if you've never dove before, if you don't understand this, it's very hard to comprehend what combat swimmer is like. But I'll give you a real quick brief. When you're doing a combat dive on a rebreather, you basically can't see anything. It's nighttime. Hmm. You're down at 10 1215 feet underwater. It's black, you can't see anything.

Speaker 1:          01:52:14       There's no like fish swimming around. There's no sea life to look at. There's no core reef. It's black, you can't see anything. The only thing you can actually see is something called an attack board, which would attack board. Sounds really cool. But let me tell you what it is. It's a piece of plastic. He used to be wood that has on it a depth gauge, a compass and a watch to time. And so you put little tiny chem lights, little glowing chem lights, and you're actually tape them up so that they're barely emitting any light at all. And you put one by the Stopwatch, one by the compass. And one by the depth gauge and when you're underwater. So you have those things, they're basically strapped onto this board that you hold. Uh, I dunno, it's like, like the, about the size of a piece of paper, eight and a half by 11 piece of paper.

Speaker 1:          01:53:08       That's about how big this board isn't on it. You've got your depth gauge, your compass and your stopwatch, and you can barely see them. They're glowing very faintly. And when you're underwater, that's all you can see. It's just that you can't see anything else. Occasionally you'll get like some weird abstract light from the moon or something. But even that's rare because you're down underwater. And if you've ever been in water with low visibility sometimes that sometimes it's actually hard to see the attack board that's two feet in front of your face. So then what you're doing is you're looking at that compass, you're looking at that depth gauge and you're looking at the stopwatch and you have preplanned legs that you're going on. You're going to go this long, this, this bearing, this long, this depth for this time. And when I say it. So you're kicking looking at this board for an hour and 17 minutes, then you're going to make a 90 degree turn and you're going to go for another 48 minutes, and then you're gonna make a right turn for 12 minutes and you're going to hit your target.

Speaker 1:          01:54:13       Then you're gonna turn around and do some other route back out. As long as you can stay underwater and standard water that eventually you run out of oxygen, you come to the t the surface and you swim the rest of the way. Do your extract any visions of the glory and the the fun of being a seal. This is not, it's work and it's hard work and you have to concentrate the whole time and you've got to make sure you don't go too shallow or too deep. If you go too shallow, you'll be seen. If you go too deep, you're going to go off the dive tables that you're allowed to be on oxygen for us. So you got to focus the whole time. And by the way, you're in this pair and your buddy that's with you, he's even more miserable than you are because he has no idea what's going on.

Speaker 1:          01:54:58       He's just trying to keep up with you because for some reason, the way you dive for the way you put your body, when you have the tack board, you can swim a little bit faster than the guy that's looking around and making sure that you're not going to hit anything and making sure you're not. So there's only one tack boards. There's a one attack board for prepare. Okay. Sometimes we would make to make a smaller attack board just because it was so much more efficient to fly with them. But you can't fly you if you're the buddy you're, you can't be just looking at the tack board. You have to look around a tack board. The attack board, that's what we call it, the attack board. So with all that, the reason I'm telling you all this is that when you're underwater, it's really easy to get confused and turned around and sometimes you go over big pieces of metal that are in the water.

Speaker 1:          01:55:42       And your compass starts to like wander around and you're, you can't communicate with your buddy. No. That's what it sounds like you've got. So we, you know, we have squeezed signals and sometimes we'd carry a grease pens to write, but it's never, there's no real effective way to communicate underwater. So you're just in this dark, just cold delined situation. Four, three, two, three, four hours at a time. And the saying is that we had is plan your dive and dive your plan because if you and I go under water and then we start trying to adjust things while we're underwater and we just, we think we're going to do something different once we go. First of all, you and I are going to be thinking two different things and it's going to be a disaster. So we, we plan our dive and dive our plan and that's reminded me of this statement.

Speaker 1:          01:56:36       Do the business of the day in the day, right? Get done what you say you're going to get done. Do it. And how simple as that. And it's like dive your plan. And what I said the other day, I said, plan what you're going to do and then do what you planned. That's real simple. And, and think about how far you're going to think of where you will be in two weeks if every day you plan what you're gonna do and then you do what your plan. Yeah. It's, it's amazing. Yeah. It seems so, say that, that, that was what we were talking about a few weeks ago where it's like distractions. That's the thing, you know, there's like just industries of distractions. Yeah, for sure. You never wake up. I was explaining to my eight year old daughter the other day that they design, cause he was playing a game on iPad. I said, oh, what are you learning from that?

Speaker 1:          01:57:29       And she said, what do you mean? I said, oh are you learning anything from that? And she said, well I, you have to get these rings. And I said, oh, so you're not learning anything from that? And she said, I don't, I don't. I said, you know what they do? They make that game to make you want to play it more. There's no, there's no end to the games to handle it. They just want you to play. That can keep clicking on that. That's there, you know? And of course I'm just being a total jerk. I'm like, yeah, look at how we look at how well it works. Look at you. See you can't put it down. Look at you. You look at you holding onto this thing and she doesn't fall for this anymore. When she was younger, I used to go up and and press her head as if her head was getting softer and I'd look at her like, Oh man, how long have you been on this?

Speaker 1:          01:58:11       For instance? I don't know. And it's a, I think if you stopped now your brain might hardened back up eventually. I do the same thing with, with her. Oh, her muscles. Like you shouldn't be eating like chips, just too many chips. There's like, oh your muscles are getting like all soft right now. Maria, she's young. She's four. So it works. It still works. But they do, they plan, they plan these things so that they addicted. Yeah. Dick those iPad once there is no, well, everything is designed that, right, right. You talk about the Facebook app that shows the little thing

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       that shows, oh yeah, like you're going to mess alert and this might be the message that I've been waiting for it variable reward. It might not be, so that's the thing. That's if you know, guaranteed it what it's going to be consistently. It's less addictive. It's called variable rewards. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. But you, everyone in their mind is thinking this might be, ah, this place might be the big one. I'm getting contacted by, by tenacious d. They saw my tweet. They're getting back at me. They're going to come on the podcast. She's tenacious. D is Jack Black and Kyle gas. Oh, right, right. Was that a movie? It's a band. Okay. From a movie. They have been in a movie. Yes. And they black Jack Black? No, that's a second or not. And as a musician. Okay. Gotcha. School of rock. That's a great shot of how, that's not a movie that's Jack Black.

Speaker 4:          01:59:33       No, no. He is an actor. Like I said, in addition to being a board member who, okay. Gotcha. Cool. Why don't we just talk about, oh yeah, because I think in all of this might be the tweet that I was waiting for it, right. From tenacious d. So I gotta check my Twitter 47 times a minute. No, not happening. You can't, you don't have a tweet from tenacious d that's not there. They didn't treat you. So don't check your Twitter. Go and do something productive. Yeah. So, and that's when you're already distracted. So basically the point was, you know, do your plot or plan your day or do you know and do the plan, right? Because no one plan your day and do what you plan. Yeah, that's it. So yeah, no one plans to work. What's really jacked up ease. If you actually took what you did in a day and you wrote it down and planned it, I bet you could get it done in so much last time.

Speaker 4:          02:00:34       Like right now, I've got a lot of stuff going on right now and I'm doing things that normally take me two hours. I'm doing in 46 minutes. Same quality getting after it, right? But you got to put a little suspense date on something and say, us do here. You've got to get it done. And then you just sit down and make it happen. That's what you need to do it. It's one of those simple, but Anita, these easy things. But this is why it's so you would you put in a way, you put these kind of parameters on what you're going to do and if like if, okay, I'm making a plan and I'm sticking to the plan, right? That's what I'm doing. So I plan to do x, Y, Z. Excellent. You know, all these things. So basically, right when you say, okay, here's the plan, you outline it.

Speaker 4:          02:01:17       If it's not in the plan, you just don't do it. It's so, so distractions. No one plans like, Hey, tomorrow I'm going to just eat like crap tomorrow. That's the plan. That's never the plan, you know? But if you don't have any plan or nothing, sure. You allow those things to come in. So was fear like, okay, tomorrow and you're not going to plan the whole day. You're not combined every meal you're going to. If you did, you'd be real effective. You'd stay on locked. Right. Got so much in the meal prep the night before. Exactly. When you go through those phases where you're cooking seven chicken breasts and you're just ready, you got everything laid out, there you go. It's real easy that people do that and it works. Yes sir. Yeah, exactly right. So, and is it realistic and really when you think about it kind of is if you're committed to it.

Speaker 4:          02:02:04       Well what's crazy is is it takes more work upfront. How long does it take to prepare all your meals for the week? And by the way, I don't do this, but how long I've done it before? How long does it take to prepare meals? It takes you two hours, two hours and 20 minutes, let's say at a time. By the way, you get done preparing those and you save time in the week, right? Cause now you're not sitting around redeploying your pots and pans, redeploying your stove setting, all that other stuff. You actually are going to save time if you plan your day and then you do your plan. Yeah. And think about this, if you use a meal prep example where, okay, you don't typically, we don't plan our every meal for a week two, we just don't do that. But when you do the meal prep planning situation, you're saying we meaning human beings in general, the typical person.

Speaker 4:          02:02:56       So that's a good example. So when you do that now, boom, that your meals, uh, an element of your life that typically isn't quote unquote planned is now planned. So now they're, those parameters are sick. So anything outside of those parameters do, you just don't really think about it as much, you know? And when they kind of enter you, it's real obvious like, hey, that's not part of this plan. What the hell? You know, it's like, it's more of a red flag, but if you don't plan it, they come in and it's kind of like whatever. There was no parameters there anyway in my head. So that goes for everything you can do. So just like how you're saying, yeah, I have a lot of stuff. So you plan, okay, I'm going to do this here and do this now, do this at this time, finish it by this time, all this stuff, those parameters are set.

Speaker 4:          02:03:33       So the distractions I've way harder tend to get it. So in everyday life you can make some ambiguous goal. Hey, I want to eat better. No plan. By the way, just it's an ambiguous goal. There's those parameters on there. So you take one misstep, you, you know you were at the stop light for longer than you expected, and now you're late for this. Now I'm pressed for time. There's a Mcdonald's, right? And it'll just sneak right in. But if you've got those parameters, then you'd be at Mcdonald's. No, not part of my plan right now. My plan, I got to do, got to execute it. And another thing, if you're going to plan your day, you should actually plan to have time in there that has nothing in it, right? So you should, you should plan to have a half an hour where you're, where you're going to address problems. Right. Okay. So that way a problems because they're going to come up, I mean you gotta, you gotta have your free time and by free, I mean free to go make other things happen and adjust and make things good. But what you shouldn't do is say, because I'll tell you there's some things that I have a really hard time, like with the podcast, I'll

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       keep preparing the podcast. I'll just kill you're carrying it. Like I'll just, I know I did go beyond that because there's another story that ties into something else and I'm going to go pull out another book. And by the way, I got to run, I don't have time to get it from Amazon, so I'm going to go to the library, you know what I mean? You go down where I could prepare for a podcast forever and not be ready for it. And so I have to put my own self and check and say, okay, draw the line on this level of depth on this thing. Now I might make a footnote and I've kind of cool category now on my computer of that's you know, tangents where I, where I opened a tangent and I didn't close it on the podcast. So now we're going to be able to enter them at a different time when, when time allows, because I can get focused on that one subject.

Speaker 1:          02:05:24       So that's pretty cool. But it takes discipline to do that because otherwise I would just go down, every rabbit hole is opened up and you take a book like this and there's so many rabbit holes and there it's almost impossible to stay out of them. Gets kind of ridiculous. Yeah. In a way. So my point is plan your day and then execute your plan. If you do that, it's going to make a huge difference in your life. And what's cool did you look up, you look up in a month, two months, three months, the amount of stuff that you've gotten done as ridiculous. And I'll tell you one of the ways that I do do that myself as I just put tasked myself with the, I say I'm going to do things and then would have to do them. Yeah, they are great. That Pie, if let's say with this podcast, a good example, we do this podcast once a week.

Speaker 1:          02:06:17       We've held the line really well on that. If we didn't, if we said, you know what, let's just put the podcast out when we put it out. If that was the mindset we had from the beginning, we would probably, I'm going to guess that we would have less than half of the podcasts would have been put out. That's my guess because we noticed said, you know what? Hey I got to train this week and I'm going to miss that and I haven't read the book that I was going to read so cause right now bro, the, Oh, I've got 15 minutes, that little half hour of my schedule where I have nothing, guess what I'm doing in that half an hour I'm doing 22 minutes worth of reading of a book that's coming up. That's what I'm doing. If we didn't have the discipline structure in place, that probably wouldn't be happening. Yeah. That probably wouldn't be happy we'd be going to, you know what little time went by.

Speaker 1:          02:07:07       Hey Bro. Yeah, let's, let's, let's, let's give this week of miss it so much easier. You know what? I was going to go hang out today and don't really want to do this today. No, we're doing it. We, we signed up for it. Yeah, totally. Now, could it get to a point where we say, you know what, every two weeks we've mentioned that before. People didn't like that idea. Yeah. Wealth didn't like that idea. I didn't like that. I knew better. You know why? Cause I liked that discipline. Yeah. Why would you know why? Because I'm basically, I'm basically confining myself to doing something productive as opposed to watching youtube videos about cats because there's some great youtube videos, right? There's some good youtube videos, but there's also a lot of them are not good and you're not getting anything out of them. Yeah. And Man, the ones that they rack up for you when you've just got done watching one, the ones that they rack up for you all, every single one of them, what did they rack up?

Speaker 1:          02:08:06       I think they rack up for on top and four on bottom on your little screen. And every one of 'em is, is like a clickbait. Right? Every one of them is a click clickbait. It's crazy. Yeah. It's, they do the obvious. They are brilliant. Yeah. Because it has a lot to do with everything that you've, you've walked for sure. So yeah, it's going to be the neck. The video is always just like, it's a month, 90% relevant to what you specifically one right there. And that is why. That is why you got to get angry at the, you know, you know, you have that, uh, you know how you have that, that way that you overcame your anger, my anger management. Right. But you read that it was like you had low self esteem. That's why you're getting mad. Well, when you get that, when you get that next rack of youtube videos staring at you, you should be getting pissed because you know what they're trying to do.

Speaker 1:          02:08:58       They're trying to get you to try to take your time away from you. And by the way, they're making money from it. When you click that next thing they're making, they're making money from what you're doing. And so they've, they've set this system up to make you click that thing. Yeah. So you're a mark is what you want. All you are mark [inaudible] look at you falling for it every single day. That's how I quit drinking too, by the way. That is legit. Like, Oh, I'm falling for a trick that my brain is playing on me. I ain't falling for that trick and falling for that trick. That, and like I said, it's hard to, because it's mixed in with positive stuff on youtube. They're really good quality stuff on Youtube. There's some great knowledge you can gain from Youtube for sure. And if you're good at justifying things, yeah, that's true too.

Speaker 1:          02:09:42       It's a really scary, but my point is I don't want us to sit here and bag on youtube because it's an incredible source of information if you keep it informational, but it's real easy to get sideways on that and they somehow know they can attach like watching a street fight too. Cause I watched street fights or I watch, uh, you know, a UFC fight or I'll watch a clip or I'll watch a submission. They know how to drag you in to like those click bait titles of the guy fighting the kangaroo. Yeah, man versus kangaroo. Unbelievable. Right. And of course you're thinking yourself, okay, well what would I do if I didn't fight her kangaroo? I live in America, man. I'm not fighting any Kangaroos, but somehow I've got to click on that video. Such garbage. So good job. Youtube. And I'm

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       not going to be a soccer over here. Nope, not it will be a mark. Give yourself a limit. Yeah, see and that goes back to what, give yourself like a clique limit on those things. Yeah. Or just set your plan right. Give yourself those parameters. Right. You won't even me thinking about it right now. It really, after you kind of explained it there, it really puts it into perspective and all the things he ever, I mean you're different than I think. I think a lot of people where sometimes people only make plans if like they have important stuff. Something that's important. I got work stuff where I got it, I got this to do list. There's like 10 things on the list, which actually seems like a pretty big to do lists. If you think 10 in one day, you know how many things you do in a day that you can get distracted from.

Speaker 4:          02:11:19       A lot of them. Yeah, more than 10 it's like a lot and that got everything. Everything from like what the day you wake up or not the day, but the, the time you wake up, what you eat every single time, by the way. Well, the TV you watch or don't watch like it's every, every second of the day. If it had a parameter on it, oh man. You'd be just laser focus on all your goals instead of these ambiguous lose weight or I want to, I need to, I dunno. Xyz more. Yeah. And I'll tell you another thing that the plan doesn't take that much time to put together. Yeah. And how you said it's, it'll end up saving you time. Oh for sure. We don't end up in one way or another. We'll 10 minutes that you spend planning the next day we'll save you four hours. You can usually get done everything you have to get done in like a half the time.

Speaker 4:          02:12:09       Half the time. It's crazy. And it's weird too because I had no thought there. I don't want to make it sound like there's some, some people that are really busy. Yeah. But I had a single mom, she's got two, three kids. She's got two, three jobs. She doesn't, you know what? She's listened this conversation going. Yeah, no kidding. Okay. Youtube. Yeah. She's in the game. 24 seven not choosing the game. 20 cause she's warm. She sleeps. She's keeping it together. Yeah. And when you say there's two things to that, yeah. There are busy people. You know how those get those, like the single moms or the single dads, they get kind of like what I just said. They are in a situation, they have no choice and they get after it. I have no choice and they get after they were like, oh, I'm going to get this done. They got their frame. They're looking at their kid, they're looking at their three year old kid that that three year old kid has nothing without that mom getting on the grind and go into the the restaurant and working as a waitress or whatever or she's working her job, whatever she's doing. Yeah. Just putting it together knows exactly Tuesday, three weeks from now I'm at four 46 she knows where she's going to be. She knows exactly where me, I mean I don't come on, you know, compared to the average person

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       we don't know. And then Kimberly average was it. You did it right. You're not even like 100% sure which could be doing in an hour because you know, cruising could interlude at any time and you might just be cruising is a very ambiguous activity. The but then go to the other side of the spectrum of busy people. I mean, they're busy because they don't plan enough. It's definitely true. Yeah. I'm so busy all the time. Meanwhile, no, no productivity, you know, or very little limited, limited, true. Plan your day. Execute your plan. All right, last little quote from this. This is Frederick the great, the battle of calling in 1757 and there were some troops that were, I read a couple of different versions. Again, speaking of rabbit holes, we start going down these rabbit holes. I read two different versions of this. There was either troops that were hesitating to attack or there were troops that were actually retreating and to these troops. Frederick the great said, dogs would you live forever and another way that was translated was you curse it rascals. Would you live forever? And who is he saying? This student, he's saying that to his own troops that are leaving either either hesitating to attack, right or they're or they're retreating and he's saying dogs. Yeah, Conan the barbarian. No. Would you live forever? No. Is that what you're looking for? To live forever? Yeah. No, you shouldn't be.

Speaker 2:          02:15:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:15:16       And you know, I think that's a good way to still wrap up that book because like we said, those two quotes always do the business of the day in the day. So plan where you do and do what you plan and dogs. You curse it rascals. Would you live forever? Let me answer that for you. No you won't. And we're here talking about a book. We're talking about a book today and we talk about leadership and that's awesome. But you've got to start by leading yourself by doing what you say you will do. That's integrity, personal integrity. When you say that you're going to do something that they've talked about being straight today, I talked about personal integrity. That starts with yourself by doing what you actually say you are going to do by not hesitating and waiting. Get a lead yourself. So

Speaker 2:          02:16:28       yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:16:28       get moving.

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       Don't wait. Do what you plan and do it today

Speaker 1:          02:16:38       because you don't get to live forever and the clock is ticking and I think that's all I've got for tonight and echo since we are not hesitating right now. If you could without hesitation to please explain to people how they might be able to support this podcast if they weren't too sure. Of course, because we don't want to live forever. I guess that doesn't mean

Speaker 4:          02:17:18       actually Conan the barbarian didn't say that. He didn't say he didn't say much in Conan the barbarian as a few lines, but not that much. His girlfriend, girl, that ends up being his girlfriend. Then she dies later, but whatever. She says, tell me the whole time when they hesitate or when they're about to do something nuts. She says, do you want to live forever? Then they just charge. Oh, okay. Well there you go. A couple she she gets. Exactly. Yeah. That's the exact usage. Anyway, speaking of not hesitating, so kettle bells I'm talking about on it, but this is kind of is relevant. Reminded me, I kind of mentioned it earlier before we started recording, so I hear good things, right? Kettlebells and I'm a little familiar, I'll incorporate them here and there, but you know, I'm just here more and more so I'm like, Hey, I'm going to make this part of the, you know, the routine. The program.

Speaker 1:          02:18:18       Yeah. You do kettle bells obviously. Yes.

Speaker 4:          02:18:24       Do you, how much dumbbell stuff Dee do like dumbbells. I actually don't use a lot of weight belts. Big Dumb Bell Guy. Yeah, like even like bench, right man, when was the last time I bench? Like people will say, hey, how much can you bench? I don't know man. Not Enough. That's my answer. It's a long time ago. Anyway, back to the countable, so starting kettle bells,

Speaker 4:          02:18:51       but I got him, you know, he'd learned the tip. Be careful with kettlebells. If you're doing the kettle bells, you know how they say yes, start off light. This, I'd say with kettlebells more so than it, because when you throw a Kelly that thing, it's not like a dumbbell is like you grab a Dumbbell, it has a perfect handle. Each side of the dumbbells, perfectly balanced, same exact way, but kettle bell has a handle that it's on the thing. It'll flip around, it'll break your Libra, you can break your hand or when you're swinging them, you know the one that you go, I don't know all the terms, sorry, but the one you grab it with a two kettlebells, the basic one between your legs, Brown. I'm like swinging it and I'm like, Bro, what if this, what if my balance was off or I dunno, whatever, and the Kettlebell hit my shin.

Speaker 4:          02:19:34       You'd be a lot of pain. It can break your Shin if you don't, even if it had like a 62 pound kettlebell you and break your shit. Be careful with that. Anyway, so to make things actually, technically they're not what I got the Onnit ones, the Werewolf and the chimp and all that. And you think when you compare them to the regular kettlebells, the kettle bells around, right. The regular ones. And so you'd think, oh, you know, the design and once with a werewolf, they might be kind of awkward cause they're not like perfectly uniform. But guess what? The balanced when they make them. Yeah. So they're just as safe. But be careful. Um, I'm, I'm explaining the new, uh, emergence of kettle bells in my workout. Yeah. And you like him? I like him a lot and the point is don't hesitate. Right. Cause you know how you know, he's like, yeah, I need to do more kettlebells and big and big ewas goal.

Speaker 4:          02:20:33       That's what it is. No parameters. But I was like, you know what? Today's the day I'm going to do, I'm going to, this is going to be the workout. My workout was, you want numbers, I'll give you numbers. So what I did, metcon, kettle bells, the Werewolf. So those are 62 pounds each ad to the double boom. So, uh, Dee Dee, I don't know if this is an actual kettle bill official movement. I think it is. You go, it's like a kettle bell swing. Two of them outside of the hips, narrow stance up to clean, clean it, right. And then press and press it right. And then back down slot boom, boom. Okay. Nebraska. Yes. So I do five reps and then five burpees walk in a circle. 35 seconds. All right. Five reps again. So I do that six times. Took like, I don't know, eight minutes, eight and a half minutes.

Speaker 4:          02:21:30       That was a mess. So same as my other Macron bolt with the kettle bells and this kind of the squat probably. It's weird. I used to do that with a bar. It's, there's a lot of little muscles in there that makes kettlebells good. Is that the one stable? They're less stable than a bar bell and they move awkwardly. Yeah. So you have to use more energy and more strength to keep them under control. So it's working some muscles that you're not used to it most likely. Yeah. And you're, it's, it's interesting because you're using, like, you can get into this kind of, it's not weird, but this flow of like, you don't, like when it swings down, it's not like, oh, it doesn't jerk you down. It will if you're not ready for it. But if you kind of know after you get used to it, it just flows.

Speaker 4:          02:22:14       It's like this almost no impact via kettle bells are good. Yeah. So do that anyway. Where would you get your kettle bells from? I get my kettle bells from on it. I only get the corns actually afterwards and I had a picture. I was going to post it online too, but I was thinking, yeah, you want to feel it was less about that at that point, you know? Um, but I, again, the Werewolf ones, so in Joe Rogan on one of the videos on there, he kind of mentioned this, he's like, I like this one because it's like, I think it was like the gorilla or something like that. He's like, it looks at you and it's like it wants to do. He says, yeah, he says that the grill looks like he wants to bite your dick off. That's what he says. Something along this line.

Speaker 4:          02:22:59       But he has a good point. Like those kettle bells, the bells when you're like, man, I really don't want to do this. And then they're just looking at you, you know, and you're like, Dang, you walk away, you come back and you look at it and it's still looking at you with the same expression because it's, you know, Kettlebell, cause it's an inanimate object and saying it helps. Yeah. You know, cause you get into the workout, you know? Yeah. You know, especially like how you, you're like, it's a challenge every time. Anyway. Do that. All right on it. Support Right.

Speaker 4:          02:23:32       audit.com/jocko 10% off kettle bells. Alpha brain. Strong bone. Yeah. Krill oil. Big Time. Shroom tech. Yeah. So with the Krill oil, mine didn't come in yet.

You don't want to let it get out of your system completely. That's not good enough. Then they got to reincorporate into it. Yeah. I think it takes about six days. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:25:28       Also, the one you mentioned it today, one called mind games. The book that I read, Oh, you put that on there? I didn't yet. The author is Michael Powell, and here's the thing, it's not like it's, it's not like a typical book where it's like talks about anger management. It's not that it's, it's literally like there's little games like mind brain exercises in there, you know, it's just everything and they're really short chapters. They're just little things in that one chapter happened to be about dealing with anger. Anyway, Michael Powell is the author on though. That was a good, I'll put it on there though. Legit. So, yeah. Anyway, Amazon Click through. Basically you clicked through there. Boom. Takes Amazon. It's a, it's a little support thing, you know, small action, big reaction or if you do other shopping on their duct tape, duct tape if you will.

Speaker 4:          02:26:14       So yeah. Any shopping really. But you know, these books, that's a good, that's a real relevant one. I think that people, um, you know, they do want to, to grab these books and boom, they're on their offer. I'm also subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already. Itunes, stitcher, Google play, whichever one you prefer. I think iTunes is the most popular, but I see significant references to Google play in general society, you know, also a lot of temperature. Stitcher. Yeah. Do you know how like a lot of times people, they don't want to go mainstream, you know? Oh yeah. It's like, like they like to keep it old school. Hard underground. Yeah. You know, it makes sense. You know, what's the old saying? Don't go with their herd or path less traveled, you know, one of those, all those same, same deal, same deal. So I get it.

Speaker 4:          02:27:05       Google play. But good news is we're on all of them. Boom. Choose your your avenue. Also Youtube. Subscribe to our Youtube Channel. We do have you youtube channel talk about every week, but it not only does it have a video version of this podcast has excerpts and deluxe serps or do those excerpts that you have enhanced. We'll just say enhanced depth excerpts also. You know what man, I have this other idea. You know what I'm going to do? I'm to make little, we'll just say other little videos too. That's what I'm going to stick. Bad add value, so to speak like that. Well the video is a very compelling form of interaction with people. That's why, that's why Youtube, I think youtube is like the most search to website, bigger than, it's more searched than Google. Maybe I'm wrong, but it's up there. If it's not number one, it's number two.

Speaker 4:          02:28:04       So if you want to learn something, people immediately, yes, I searched youtube. Yeah, that's what I guess what you remember the other day we talked about youtube red. Yeah, I got youtube red. Oh, I'll buy because the ads, the ads is one thing, but also because you can listen to music without it being on the screen. It plays in the background like iTunes that is that the main reason now I can get any album that, cause a lot of the music is a lot of music that I listened to isn't on iTunes because it's old school. It's hardcore. It's underground, like literally not on there, but the youtube videos up there crazy. It's a youtube video will be on there from some random hardcore band from New York, upstate New York and they're there. They're there. One album that they made, the one e p five songs long that came out in 1987 it'll be on youtube.

Speaker 4:          02:29:00       It's not anywhere near iTunes. It's on it and you can play it, which is awesome. Makes Sense. I guess they youtube red sometimes they'll put or not something to all the time. Do you have youtube red? No. No, because the main selling point problem is that the albums without tracks, just Fyi, you like albums with tracks. These are alphabetic without tracks. Well typically I don't listen to Youtube for the music situation where I'd go to, if you have red you will change that. Maybe I mean red, they push it with hey, no ads and then I'm like cool, no ads. But man, I'm not that quick to jump on the no Ed's thing. There had been plenty of times for a lot of times with movies, but the ads that play, I all like it'll be for me directly for me. Like Dang, this ad is helping me in a way.

Speaker 4:          02:29:48       Sometimes the ultimate youtube person battling maybe a quick, the next video I'm going to enjoy the advertisement. The Tai Lopez adds a lot, you know that is right. Tai Lopez, he's a um, he's super smart guy. He's actually one of the reasons why like I started reading a lot, like one of the reasons and so smart guy pled his ads are all over youtube, but I know it's my fault because it's relevant to what I watch apparently. You know how they do that. So it's my fault, but those are the ads. I get tired of this shit. You go to college, you know what I'm talking about. Anyway. Um, yeah. So yeah, subscribe to our youtube, you know, got some subscribers on this. Some good feedback, you know, having to keep posting videos. It does help that people will say echo post videos in addition to just use requesting peer pressure like that.

Speaker 4:          02:30:37       That's good. Yeah. Um, so yeah, so I've tried to be need to, that's a good, uh, also Jack was a store. It was called Jocko store. Jocko store.com on there. We have t shirts. If you wear tee shirts, you know, check them out. If you're interested in anything on there, get something. I'm not saying a bias, I'm not saying, hey guys, go to [inaudible] dot com and buy a t shirt. I'm not saying that. I'm saying go to Jocko store.com. There's some shirts on their hoodies, on their rash guards, patches, some women's stuff, some tank tops and whatnot. Travel mugs, hats coming soon. Anyway, check them out if you like go hats coming soon before. Yeah. So far I've been impressed by your turn times on that. Yeah. It just depends on what you think soon. Well would you say soon? To me that means to me means three days. Okay. So I grew up in quiet for hats. Don't care. We knew from, no, no, no. I'm not saying the toy in town. I'm not saying that it is, but that's not what I'm saying right now. Okay. So quiet in Oman. On Coy in Hawaii. So on the end of Omal road is a, I don't know what it is, a church or religious center or something and it says on the top it says Jesus coming soon. And that went up when I was I think

Speaker 4:          02:31:56       seven years old. So soon is a relative term very relevant or irrelevant relative. Yes. It's a sliding scale for sure. Let me tell you what hats I hope get here before the return of Jesus. Yes. That's the goal for sure. We can make that happen if the officer nice. Alright. Cause he got it summertime. Yup. Now, right now it's summertime. So we need hats to wear in the sun. All right. To block the sun. Yes. That's what had to do. Yeah. Got You. So yeah, there it is. Jocko, store.com if you see something on there that you like, you recognize the layers.

Speaker 2:          02:32:31       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:32:31       Grab something. Support. Here's a little thing. Jocko designed a shirt design specifically 100% too. By the way, by Jocko. I even tried to put my little pinky in there and some input. Yes, straight up denied. I'm like, Bro, do you know who manages that? Sure. Yet it's not up. It's been printed, but you know, we went with it and 100% Jockos designed 100% not really approved by me. I mean it's approved, but like I tried to like make my little considerations, my little altered the nations and God was watching out for them alterations. I was worried about my creative input. We overcame them. Totally overcame them. Yeah. Trump. So I said, we're making this shirt and that's a direct order.

Speaker 4:          02:33:26       What happened? Now you're w you. Yeah, you finessed it for sure. But at the end of the day I looked up and I was like, Dang my input on, you know, the store that you know, I, I think, I feel like I'm the manager of the store. Apparently I'm wrong, but that's cool. So anyway, new shirt as a result designed by Jocko Jocko, star.com. That's a good one. Also, psychological warfare, if you didn't know what that is, it's an album with tracks of Jacqueline's voice saying and telling, helping. So what it's doing, it's helped me. No hope so people, myself included, by the way, through moments of weakness if they arrive. Arise. All right man. All right. Yeah. So yeah, if you're having trouble or one day, if you want an alarm clock of me, which people ask me for, just get psychological warfare instead. It is your alarm. Yeah, that's it.

Speaker 4:          02:34:20       That's why we meet it because everyone was asking for that. So there you have it. You don't need to, you don't need it. We're not going to make a ring tone, I don't think. Yeah, we'll take, yeah, technically you just said it. You just said it as a ring tone and your guide, it's, yeah, and it works really good. Especially that, well it depends on your weakness, right? Or what kind of person you are. So you know me, if you say, Hey Echo, wake up at four 30 for one year every morning, one year there's going to be a day or two where it's going to be harder than you know, than another day. So you put it on the track. What time do you wake up? That's classified. So if you have a noon, I woke up at noon on Saturday cause you're still on Hawaiian time.

Speaker 4:          02:35:08       Did you wake up at noon? How could you even do that? I didn't mean to, it was, it's a long story. But yes, my wife was like, hey, it was good for you to join us or nice, nice of you to join us. Wife is ragging on you for a until noon credit to her, she was just like, she got two kids to take care of sprawled out queen size bed, getting African. Oh God. It's not going to make a change. Nonetheless, back to psychological warfare. If you have, you know, if you're on a d cool diet, you're eating is clean. Boom. You get that temptation one day at work, the donuts, you don't, they bring the donuts, right? We talk about these all the time. Yeah. People just do that too. Okay. He don't, Gracie, he run our wire.

Speaker 3:          02:35:52       Arlene,

Speaker 4:          02:35:54       he talks about um, like how you go to a restaurant and they're like, oh, so cute. The kids. Here's some, you know, here's a cupcake for the kid's so cute. Right? And people like overlook how rude and uh, it's like, uh, it's how much of a violation that is rat poison. You can feed them while you're on it. Hey Look, look how cute your kids, our kids, let me give them something super unhealthy violation. Anyway, that's what happens when people bring donuts for work and thinking, Oh, I'm going to do this for the office.

Speaker 4:          02:36:25       Not that I frown upon that. I'm just saying put it into perspective. Nonetheless. If someone does that while you're at work, boom, you got to track where that to just put it on real quick, but on your buds, you know? So it's for you sugarcoated lies, sugarcoated lies directly into your, anyway, it's called psychological warfare. Look at it on or look for it on iTunes, Jocko Willink, Google play, Google play, Amazon music, all that stuff. Yeah, good stuff. Wherever the MP3S are being distributed or also on Amazon, you can get Jocko white tea. And here's a little verified purchase review. Again, this means that the person, this is verified, it's 100% so here's the review. As a tea guy, I am somewhat picky, so I ordered some Jocko white tea. I'm pretty sure the box was Groundling when I opened it. That's a verified review. I brewed up tea and poured

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       it over ice. After which I went on my bike for a training ride, I was pulled over twice. I explained that I had consumed some Jocko white tea before I left and the officer just nodded and said get after it. The next officer was not so forgiving and gave me a ticket for speeding limit. So in summary, this you can get pretty pricey if you don't mind speeding tickets while you're riding a bike. So as just another thing to be careful of if drink Jocko white tea and then you get on a bike, you've got to watch out that you don't get speeding tickets cause you're gonna be going a little faster than the speed limit. That's the Jocko white tea. Also on Amazon you can get way the warrior kid and this, this review here of way of the warrior kid also verified purchase review from Amazon.
