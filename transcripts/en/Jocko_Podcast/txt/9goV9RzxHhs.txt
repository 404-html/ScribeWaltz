Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 87 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. I'd been away from infantry and from the army I'd grown up in for far too long. Walking through the gates of Coleman barracks was stepping into the welcome past. The old army had not died after all. The 18th was military perfection. Men stepped smartly across my tip, meticulously kept the grounds, starched uniforms, blue infantry, scarves, dazzling, shiny brass and boots, snappy salutes and cheerful. Good afternoon, sirs marked my journey to the HBCU where I'd sign in. The spirit of this fine unit was already infecting me. The hot stifling windless day, the ragweed pollen that blew in from adjacent fields covering the camp and immediately activating my hay fever.

Speaker 2:          00:01:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:06       The rundown boring camp itself, none of it mattered as inwardly. I was transported to an island oasis on touched by turbulent seas.

Speaker 2:          00:01:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:19       And it was all thanks to one man, the battle group commanding officer who would forever be my model, mentor and friend, Colonel Glover. S Johns was the finest senior infantry commander I'd ever seen or ever would see again. We shared a mutual abiding respect almost from the moment we met. He was my kind of soldier and I was his. He was a warrior patents aid before World War Two. Then during the war, he'd hit the beaches of Normandy as part of the 29th division and fought from those bloody shores all the way across Europe until victory was achieved as a battalion commanding officer. He had headed the task force, the captured the critical French town of St Lo in Korea. He'd served as executive officer, then regimental commander in my own 40th division. His reputation there was awesome. One story that made its way through the division was that a wild new XL had come into the two to fourths, gotten down on his belly in the mud to check the units, machine guns, field of fire, and promptly moved two thirds of the machine gun bunkers that had sat there for two years.

Speaker 2:          00:02:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:40       Later when he took over as commanding officer of the two to 24th and the unit move to a new sector, he'd outpost to dispar about 200 yards in front of one of his companies so the North Koreans couldn't do at first with this move was considered seizing ground and against no when rules of the war and soon the XCOR commanding general flew down to John's position to discuss the matter with him. After exam examining the situation, general white told him he could keep the spur but was never to advance again even his outpost line without express permission from core cause blue eyes sparkled like those of a wise and truly tested man who'd long since realized that humor could be found in just about anything. He had seen his share of horror, his cheeks were rosy and the dueling scar that crossed one of them and no way detracted from his Jen rugged yet gentle old soldier face. Maybe the scar even enhanced it, I don't know, but it sure gave him more character and provided a good yarn to boot. In any event. Colonel Glover, s Johns was a 49 year old stud.

Speaker 1:          00:04:07       Colonel Johns was a basics man and a total soldier. He taught and insisted that his company commanders teach things like terrain appreciation, the knowledge of which was a basic tool of a soldier's trade to be able to look at a piece of ground and appreciate the slightest differences in the comm tour, to notice how the ground unfolds and be able to think. There's cover over their cover. The one essential providing protection from direct enemy fire to recognize a streamline of gully or treed area as an avenue of approach through which a unit could move unseen to understand and identify the best ground from which to launch or repel an attack. Shoot, scoot and communicate. The morning battle drill began with fire and maneuver. One man firing while his buddy moved a fire team moving wallets counterpart fired colonel. John's likened it to a fighter's bobbing, weaving and jabbing. We kept the mythical enemy pinned down while we jabbed our way to close on his position. That's covering move by the way. The colonel was right there with us to set the example and we did it until we got it right. We'd ended up black and blue running, hating the ground and rolling into firing position with full field equipment on is not without pain, but no one bitched because John's again and again reinforced the simple equation. The quicker you get to the ground and you get your weapon to position, the sooner you'll be delivering effective fire on the enemy and the longer you'll stay alive.

Speaker 1:          00:05:49       Still, this truism was just one part of the overall strive to better your best philosophy. That characterized the first, the w of the 18th under Colonel Johns and deputy commanding officer couch in couches words. It was our policy to encourage excellence among the soldiers, particularly in bayonet training, unarmed combat shooting, and total physical fitness. This is what really makes a soldier. If he masters masters these subjects, he'll fight. From my experience in Korea, I could not have agreed more.

Speaker 1:          00:06:34       So that's a little opener from a book called about face, my favorite book by, it's written by Colonel David Hackworth, and he's talking about a guy that was his commander in the early 1960s Hackworth had gotten out of the army and then came back in after a couple of years because he realized to civilian life was not fun. And so he came back in and he got stationed in Germany and this guy by the name of colonel glove rest Johns, who by the way, he dead Hackworth the dedicates. He's dedicated the book to him for two minutes and some other soldiers that he worked with along the way. But it's their Glover Johns. He says, dedicated this book to Glover Johnson who showed us how to lead.

Speaker 2:          00:07:22       Mm.

Speaker 1:          00:07:24       So Glover, John's outstanding combat leader. And luckily we can all learn from Glover. John's not only from what he passes through Hackworth in Hackworth book, but also from his own book club rest. John's wrote his own book called the Clay Pigeons of St Lo about his push from Norman d and across France that Hackworth just referenced. Now, it's interesting when we go into this book, the Clay Pigeons, the St Lo, he, he writes the book in the third person and he says that it was just easier for him to write it that way. So in other words, he's, he doesn't say, I did this and I did that. He says, Major Johns did this and major dog John said something else. But what's interesting is he said that one of the reasons he was able to, one of the reasons that he did that was because the guy that was commanding in combat was a battalion commander and comment was different from his normal self.

Speaker 1:          00:08:30       And so we had this combat John's combat Glover, John's that was out there leading things and he had normal John's. That was the way he lived his normal life. But it was easier for him to write and more natural for him to write about this major John's guy in the third person. And he also likes it cause it can gives him, it gives me the ability to kind of detach from it and explain what was going on. So when you hear it, it's all about major John's instead of being about me and about I, but it's, it's him and even though it's written from the third person, it is absolutely a first person account from a battalion commander in combat, close, intense combat, and let's pick it up. Going to the book, the Clay Pigeons of St Lo.

Speaker 1:          00:09:31       Here we go. Sharp ballistic cracks pounded his ear drum so rapidly. They seemed like one impossibly prolonged rifle shot. He was instantly paralyzed with overwhelming fright. The radio operator, Jimmy slumped forward at his feet. Another man stumbled pass to fall into the ditch ahead. Then Newcome cleared the eight foot hedgerow apparently with one jump, but the major was too shocked to move. His stomach knotted itself into a tight ball. It jammed against his pounding heart while his breath stopped completely for an instant, then came and Jerky gasps the hair on his head, felt as if it were rising like the hair on a cat's back, his skin prickled all over. But the most awful thing was the cold empty feeling in his guts. The burst of German machine gun fire lasted only seconds, but it seemed like a lifetime before he could reach up and snatch or grenade from his pistol belt.

Speaker 1:          00:10:31       He'd never heard a bullet crack by inches from his head. He didn't know they sounded like that. He thought there was a German with a burp pistol behind the nearest tree on top of a hedge row. He grabbed the pin on the grenade, but before he could throw it something made him stop and yell. Anybody on the other side, he got a quick answer. Hell yes. Before he could lower his arm. The blast of a rifle right in his lap made him flinch. He squirmed back even closer against the hedge row. As Martin and grim cell went into action, they'd been at the front all 11 days since a continuous line had been established in Normandy. The crack of bullets was nothing new to them, almost side by side, lying flat and the ditch. They fired methodically across him and over Jimmy's head. Mechanically. He checked the pin in the grenade then still a little dazed, hooked it back onto his belt harnessed. He looked at the man who had fallen in the ditch and now was trying to weekly push himself up. It was Lieutenant Sadler, his face already greenish gray with shock. He had been hit five or six times in the head, chest, and both arms major. John's knew instinctively that Sadler was as good as dead. He called to him to lie, steal and take it easy. But the Charlie company commander was already beyond hearing.

Speaker 1:          00:12:01       John's felt that he ought to do something constructive, something to get their minds off the tragedy that had just struck, but it was without inspiration merely numb. Hey, you guys yelled grizzle. Let's Scram Outta here. That brought the commander out of the days he had been in ever since. The deafening burst of enemy fire, perhaps two minutes before he leaned forward and shook Jimmy Shoulder. Come on, Jim. It's all over now you can get up. Jimmy didn't move major. John's shook him again. Then he saw blood oozing slowly, thickly, brightly across his own shoe. Gently. He pulled a Jimmy's far shoulder, a neat, clean little bullet hole in the boy's helmet came into view. So the major knew that Jimmy was dead. Something impelled him to pull Jimmy over until he could look into his face. The eyes were closed and an odd little half smile made Jimmy look as if he were asleep. Dreaming Pleasant Dreams. Slowly the major lowered him back to the ground and for a fleeting instant watched Jimmy's lifeblood continued to flow across his shoe.

Speaker 1:          00:13:30       So that's his really his first experience in combat. And you can see, obviously it's, it's a hell of a wake up call. And the whole book, the whole book is like this. It's an, it's an incredible book. The, the way he describes the battles and how they're laid out and the way he lays out his own thoughts and what's going on. It's just a, it's, it's an, it's an outstanding book and it's one of these books where as I had to consciously say to myself, okay, Jocko, you cannot read this whole book on the podcast. We need to, you know, people need to read it for themselves. But the book is that the description of combat like that, that opening is phenomenal. So let's go back to the book now where that first battle is over and he's having some thoughts here. We go back to the book. As he walked, he couldn't keep his thoughts away from the hot spot he'd been in a few minutes before and the lessons he learned so quickly, but it's such a price. In little more than an hour of his first fight, he lost two company to radio operators and three other men besides just escaping death himself. As he thought about the crack of those machine gun bullets, his stomach began to score him again until by a conscious effort. He forced it to behave.

Speaker 1:          00:15:08       He couldn't understand why he hadn't been hit to Jimmy's head. Had been not more than two feet from his own Newcomb and the front and Sadler directly behind him had been hit. The whole burst must've missed him by scan inches. He decided, and he very seriously thank God for his safety. At the same time, he promised never again to risk the lives of others if he could avoid it. It was a bitter lesson repeated every time the eyes of his mind focused on Jimmy's bright blood oozing over a shoe or on Sadler. Sudden death. He looked down at the shoe, shuttered at the still red stain and tried to scuff it off on the grass on his way to the regimental command post, the major passed a knocked out Sherman tank. What distinguished this? Smoking Brown hoke from others he had seen that day was the single blackened claw like hand and forearm that was thrust out of the turret turret toward the sky. The fingers were separate and more than half curled like the talent of a striking eagle, but there's hand was not striking. It seemed rather to be calling down an implication on the fate that it let it die there in agony.

Speaker 1:          00:16:40       So now he gets to the regimental commander. Well, boom, the regimental commander, what's going on? I've just been trying to get to you. John saluted it as he answered, sir, we're stuck at the second hedge row and I had to use my reserve to protect my flanks. It doesn't look as if we'll get to the forge today unless we have better luck later. Have many casualties. I Dunno about the companies yet because I haven't had any reports from them except the yells about their flanks and counter attacks. But nab was wounded early Sadler is dead, and I've lost two operators besides three other men out of my own CP group.

Speaker 1:          00:17:20       He was still too full of his experience not to want to tell about it. The colonel listen sympathetically. Well, he said when the major was through, we've got to keep going regardless. Division wants to get the forge tonight. So yeah, you just had that rough day. First Day of combat. Guess what? We're still going at it. You know, one of the things that in that opening paragraph that I pointed out was you could see his reaction when that first fight broke out. His reaction was sort of overwhelming, overwhelmed by the whole scenario. But it's two guys. And what happened is, and you know he talks about this in the book, but he had gone on the Normandy, but he wasn't in charge of a battalion yet. He was sort of a back with the regimental command and then one of the battalion commanders was out of the fight and I forget if the battalion commander was killed or wounded, but he went and took this battalion commander's job so he wasn't on the real front lines until they were starting to push through France a little bit.

Speaker 1:          00:18:23       Then it was only a matter of days. But these, well I guess it was 11 days cause these guys are, he said that these other guys had been on the front lines for 11 days. So these guys, it's been 11 days. But guess what, there they start getting shot at, boom, they're there, they're in the mode, they're returning fire and you could see they're returning fire. Really cool. So close that it scared him. And that's one of the things that, you know, a lot of times I talk about simunition and training with simunition and how awesome it is and, and that's totally true. And I love training with ammunition and it really is very beneficial for your tactical skill level, but you also absolutely have to do live fire. And the reason you have to do live fire, I mean there's a bunch of reasons you have to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:19:06       You know, you have to learn to shoot real bullets and hit real targets or with your bullets, but also guns are loud and you need to condition yourself to be used to having, uh, uh, mark 48 machine gun, four inches, maybe not forced, but like 16 inches from your head and your buddy is dumping rounds down range. And you have to be able to think during that and not be overwhelmed by it to the simunition. That's one's an ass. Like how, what's the difference in loudness is not even comparable. So is it, so it's not even really like not gun shot? No, it's not like a gunshot. It's not comparable. It's not, the noise is not comparable. The noises is less than a cap gun kind of. Yeah. Like an air soft gun is loud and a mark 48 machine gun. It's really that, and it's sending little shockwaves.

Speaker 1:          00:19:58       Every round is like a little shock that you get. And so that's why, that's why it is so important to train live fire. And it's also important to be comfortable not only yourself shooting in close proximity with other people, but also them shooting near you. Cause you've got to trust the guys that are around you. Now there's standard operating procedures that there's things that you don't do that keep it safe, but it's still, I mean, when somebody makes a bet, if somebody makes a really bad mistake and they can walk into your field of fire, and so you have to be heads up, but you still have to take shots with people that are really close to you in a firefight, by the way. Well, yeah, in a firefight. But if you haven't done it during training, your first, your first minute in a firefight is going to be just, just overwhelmed and you're not gonna be overwhelmed by enemy fire.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       You'd be overwhelmed by your own guy shooting the mirror and you're going to be hitting, getting hit by brass and, and just, it hurts, Hon. Yeah. Hot Brass and the, the links coming out of a mark 48 are like little weapons themselves. And when they hit the, yeah, we had, uh, one of our machine gunners was a lefty and he picked up and started shooting who he picked up that machine gun and started shooting lefthanded and that dumps the brass basically right on your right bicep. And he had a, he had a bruise on his, on his right arm that looked like somebody beat him with a baseball bat in the arm. That's what a mark 48 ejector port does to you. It doesn't play around. So again, going back to the situation he's in right now, he's, he's had all these casualties and they're like the major says, Hey, yup. Uh, regardless, we've got to keep going, which is w which is the way war actually is.

Speaker 1:          00:21:49       So that night, um, he has a little company, little huddle with the company commanders and you know, just to, just to kind of spell this out, if you're wondering what this is all about. So he's got the, he's a battalion commander, so, and if he's actually got this written out in the book, but a Battalion Co, a battalion in 1944 was about 900 guys, 900 men, 28 officers. You got three companies. The three companies are broken down into three platoons. Each one of those platoons has a platoon leader, but each one of the companies has a company commander, a captain. And so that's what he's talking about. So he, so those are your kind of your hundred and 50 men fighting elements are these companies with three platoons in them of 50 people each about, and it's weird because people always think the military is, everything's perfectly structured.

Speaker 1:          00:22:38       But actually this, this changes all the time, not based on, but based on your mission, you know, sometimes you, you might have a platoon that needs to get plussed up or a company that's shorter people. So there's no, there's no consistent, just all the time number. Let me see what he says. The actual number that they were supposed to have in a, in a company at this time was each rifle company was made up of six officers and 186 men. That's what they are supposed to have in them. Now you're going to find out real quick that they rarely have even close to a hundred, but that's what they're supposed to have. So at this point, he's bringing in these three company commanders to talk to them about kind of a plan and also to get a debrief on, on what happened during the day and what they're planning to do.

Speaker 1:          00:23:24       Hat here we go back to the book. He thought a moment, and this is, this is, uh, one of the company commander's name, Lieutenant Ryan. And he's talking and he says he thought a moment and then added. We might make it across the road if we pour a lot of smoke and mortars into them and then rush them, but it'll take. But uh, but it's getting awfully late to be beating around in this kind of country. So trying to figure out how to move forward. And Lieutenant Ryan. That was kind of Lieutenant Ryan suggestion. Let's mortar him, put a bunch of smoke out and then we can move, but guess what? It's getting late and if we're running around once it gets dark, it's going to get scary. Ryan stopped and looked at Kenny. It was Kenny's turn and Kenny, you're going to find out is a legit Badass. Sir. I only had a few minutes to look things over before Wendell came along and he invited me back here to see you, but that orchard is a terrible place. No cover anywhere. Machine guns covering every inch of it. We lost a lot of men in there the first time he paused, but we'll do the best we can. Well, rough or not, we're going ahead. The major stated flatly,

Speaker 1:          00:24:30       by the way, Kenny just took over for, for one of the company commanders that had been a wounded or killed. Now they start pushing and all of a sudden they're pushing forward. And again, I have to skip through this book and I'm trying to highlight the leadership scenarios or the things that reveal the way human beings react in hard situations. But when you read this book yourself, you can really follow the tactical decision making process and also how the battles went and what happened. Obviously I can't go through the whole thing right now, but at this point they had started pressing and all of a sudden he sees guys running away running. So you know as the company commander, and he talks about this where he positions himself and obviously he doesn't position himself right on the front with the platoons. He's back a little bit at this point, guys start, he sees guys are running back towards him.

Speaker 1:          00:25:23       At first he thinks it might be Germans, he's no, it's Americans, it's his guys. And here we go back to the book. That major got to his feet. He started a crouching run to the left. He had nearly reached the end of the field when four or five men yelling, don't shoot, don't shoot. Piled over the hedge row. That's separated. Charlie and Baker companies. He stopped car being alert as he lowered his gun. Wondering what this was all about. A figure stepped out from the hedge row and voiced the same question. What's going on here anyway, just what's this all about? It was lieutenant I period. Arms spread wide to catch the running men carbines slung over his soldier shoulder. The picture of calm. He caught the leading man by his jacket, which piled the others up in a tight little, not the man pound.

Speaker 1:          00:26:09       Panted Krauts, paratroopers. They're right behind us. Run a period, glanced over the man's shoulder. Unmoved. Well, now I don't see any crowds. Just look, the men looked back. All they could see were several Charlie company men standing quietly. Rifles ready. The leader of the runaways relaxed then shuttered violently. I period went on. I don't think there's any crowds chasing you at all. Let's just go see about this. The man tried to pull away from him, but there were, he cried. There were, I tell they came right over the hedgerow and shot down right down the whole squad. They got the sergeant and all the rest. We're the only ones left. They nearly got me. Look, he poked a finger through a hole in his jacket, but I period, unimpressed moved in the direction of Baker company even as the man protested dragging him along while the others followed meekly.

Speaker 1:          00:27:04       Well, I period went on, let's just go see what captain Weddell has to say about the Aldis. He called softly to the men guarding the company flank, see anything? No Sir. The answer came back quickly and calmly. The mortar observer and his little group of panic stricken men disappeared over the head dro, the major new. He had just seen a wonderful example of leadership at its very finest. I period, quickly, calmly and efficiently had stopped what could have been a route. So one leader steps out and really what he's doing, if you think about it, he's detached because he wasn't in that situation. Where do you need some Germans came over and obviously shot at him more close range, killed a couple of guys, you know, would've would've wounded this soldier who got shot through his jacket. But he just gets, he kind of gets the guy to detach, hey look, there's no one there.

Speaker 1:          00:28:00       Calm down. Let's go have a look. Let's take a step back. And that kind of calmness prevented everyone cause cause what can go in the other direction, right? We can go the other x. Do you see people running? That's what happens. You see people running, you start running and you know that that was very interesting in the, in the, I don't know if you remember some of those police shootings where, I remember there's one in New York City where something like 57 rounds were fired. It somebody that was unarmed and everyone's going, why? Why was everyone shooting? And I'll tell you what happens is, you know, for some reason they think you think somebody has a weapon or a suspect was going to do something bad and now you've got five or six people that are holding a gun on him. Well, when one's person started shooting, when people are not attached and when people are caught up in the moment, everyone starts pulling the trigger and it's, it's, it can be really devastating.

Speaker 1:          00:29:00       It can be really devastating. Yeah, so wait, but when people are used to that kind of stress and they're calm and they're detached, one person takes a shot, you, you, you actually, instead of just firing yourself, you actually assess and say, okay, what is he shooting at? I need to get cover. So there's, that's why that training is so important to get people at a high stress level and still think through things and still be detached. The stress is going to be there, put it in a box, monitor it, don't get in it because you're going to make bad decisions. You might not make any decisions. You might just go off of your reactions, which are, I'm sitting here with a gun. People are shooting, I'm going to shoot to. That's not, I mean it's like how you say when you're not trained, you don't have experience in those types of situations.

Speaker 1:          00:29:44       Like A, you're the shooting example. It's, it's one of those things where you see it in Jujitsu when you started this exact, literally the exact same thing where, so in a shooting situation, one guy shoots, you hear the gunfire, basically your brain just says, okay, it's on. Yeah, it's a 100% let's go a full speed. 100% it's on, you can't like gun shots are being fired. It's not, not on. You got to go 100%. So in Jujitsu, when you first start, you know how like the guys just going full speed the whole time, you're in a spot where it's like you can't move here. You can't, you're completely trapped right here. Not some mission necessarily, but you're trapped and going crazy. You know, just cause you don't know they, it's on. It's either to honor, it's not on. Yeah. So when you're drained, what you're talking about is an individual, individual moment.

Speaker 1:          00:30:30       What I'm talking about, his group, it's a group think scenario where, you know, just like it happens when there's a, uh, a gunshot and everyone starts running people. But the people in the background don't even know what they're running. Gosh, I just see people running. So they're running. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true. Well, you imagine how amped you are. You think there's a bad guy in a dark alley and you're, you're there with four your police partners or your or your, your military partners. You're looking down now you think there's a insurgent there and all of a sudden around cracks off you're, you're lucky. And there's a, there's a situation that happened where there, where there was an Iraqi soldier that had an accidental discharge and you know what that is like we like it was laced platoon and layoffs, wave Splatoon was taken down a building and I was actually outside the building, you know, cause we were taking out multiple buildings but they were in one building and all of a sudden crack a couple rounds, get shot off.

Speaker 1:          00:31:26       And you know what it was actually, I'm pretty sure that it was, I'm pretty sure Andrew Paul, this is a whole cast of characters. I'm pretty sure Andrew Paul was at like the head of the train or close to the front of the train in inside that they were inside this building rounds get fired. And Andrew Paul's thinking, okay, I think, I think I remember Andrew Paul telling me this angel Paul's like, okay, well we're going to grenade these. We're going to throw frag grenades into this next room cause people are shooting at us. And it was a guy, another heads up guy a couple feet back that knew where the gunfire came from. And where it came from was an Iraqi soldier friendly. Iraqi soldier had cracked off rounds and accidentally, accidentally. And you know, luckily that that guy was a great guy. I've really heads up, guy grabbed him, almost killed, almost choke the shit out of him right there.

Speaker 1:          00:32:15       But can you imagine you're clearing a house where there's suspected and surgeons and all of a sudden rounds are five. Well now you're, but this is the discipline. And the guys knew, okay, the guys didn't all just freak out and started shooting. The guys were, you know, somebody said, hey, somebody grabbed the person that shot, hey that was an AAD. Okay, wrap it back down, wind it down, everyone calm. You know what I mean? So there's the difference between guys who have been trained really well and when you haven't been through that country. And again also, luckily that was, that didn't happen on the second night of deployment. We were, you know, further into the deployment where guys had been through it. So was just like we just talked about guys had guys had been through plenty of firefights at this point. So they weren't freaked out that there was gunshots.

Speaker 1:          00:32:58       They were like, okay wait a second, where is this gun shots coming from? But that could have gone really, really nasty. So train, train realistically. All right. At this point. And, and also just like some of the other books we've read about World War II where we've got, you know, it's basically a movement. It's basically continually moving, trying to take down targets, trying to move forward, trying to get through France, trying to get to Berlin. That's, that's the situation. And it's the same thing here. These guys, this, these battalions and this regimen and the, basically the whole task force is trying to move from, from city to city or town to town through France. And that's what's going on here. So it's, it's a continual series of attack, dig in, attack, dig in, attack, dig in. And you know, you can tell from the title of the book what they're going for is this, this final, you know, some city of St Lo and France.

Speaker 1:          00:33:53       So at this point there's an attack that they were getting ready to go on and he's trying to figure out why it got canceled and he's talking to, uh, the commander and he says, I think, I think you've got farther from where you started than anyone else. So he's telling these standalone major John's, your battalion went further than anyone else back to the book. In fact, I believe that's why division canceled your attack. If you'd made La Forge, you would've been way out on a limb and stood a chance of being caught off major. John's elated at their comparative success was thankful that he had not renewed the attack and perhaps made another 500 or a thousand yards. They would have been out front like clay pigeons for anyone to knock down. There was the first time he had seen a practical application of what was popularly known as the big picture supposedly concocted for edification of high brass and war correspondents, yet sufficiently vague to cover a certain amount of error on the ground.

Speaker 1:          00:34:56       So the reason that I wanted to call that out is he's admitting that from his perspective, like why are you stopping my attack? And at this point they had, they'd gotten bogged down and then they were ready to go again. Then they got back down and now they were ready to go and they get told to stop. And so his first reaction, kind of, what do you wait, why are we stopping? We've actually got some momentum right now. And then he finds out that from the big picture, the reason you're not attacking, just cause you're too far out ahead of everyone. If you get go any further, you might get surrounded and cut off. Now this is a situation where understanding why, why is so helpful and especially if you push that all the way down to the frontline troops and to the frontline leadership that's out there thinking, Hey, we finally made some some offensive progress and we can move and we can really take it to the enemy and now you're telling us to stop what is going on. The headquarters is stupid. They don't get it. They don't understand that actually they do understand, but they need to do a better job of explaining why. So the, so let the people know.

Speaker 1:          00:36:07       All right, moving on to this next section here. He's checking out kind of his line now that they're, now that they're dug in a little bit, he'd gone to regiment. You know, it's really easy to forget that these guys, and I talk about this a bit, but the best type of communications that they have is when they actually run wires between different, between regiment, between battalions, between the companies. They try and runs wires because the radios are fairly temperamental on whether they work or not. So they use radios, a backup, but the primary communication is is running a wire and he had just gone back to regiment to meet face to face cause me fake meeting face to face is very important and you know he just comes back up and he asks one of the company commander, actually I think it was his, his ops officer Newcomb.

Speaker 1:          00:36:58       He says, Hey, any news and new has ops officer says Nope, everything's quiet as a church. The s three looked at the battalion commander and the starlight and grinned as he went on. Now major, you don't have to concern yourself with everything up here. You just leave the details to us. We're used to looking after them. So a little bit of decentralized command. Don't worry about a boss. We got this. We're going to be all right now. Next day rolls around and here we go. Back to the book around 1,000 the Germans shelled the battalion heavily but they didn't follow up. Follow this up with an attack by 1100 the wounded had all been evacuated and the wire lines had been relayed to the regimen. The major instructed Grizzle to collect all five company commanders and meet him as soon as possible at the crossroads of the edge of the woods from which they had first attacked. It was only a little way from the regimental command posts to the edge of the woods. He got there well before the others when they came up a few minutes later, he knew he missed Newcomb before he caught the meaning of their odd mode manner. Grim sells set face have given him a hint. As the s two step forward saluted very stiffly and said with visible effort to keep his emotions under control. Sir, I must report that captain Newcomb is dead.

Speaker 1:          00:38:21       The others look silently at the ground and tears began to stream down. The gentle grim sells face. The news struck the major with the force of a physical blow of all the fine men he had met since taking command of the battalion. Newcomb had been one of the very best. He was quick, willing and intelligent wise, far beyond his 24 25 years.

Speaker 1:          00:38:48       He also stared at the ground for a moment and then ask quietly how did it happen? Ryan spoke up, same sniper, same place as the doc, so a doc had been killed earlier by a sniper. One of my men wore nuke to stay out of that gap and the hedge row, but he took the steel part of his helmet off and sat down on it. Right Square in the gap itself. The sergeant who thought the captain must have gone nuts all of a sudden was coming after him to drag him away, but too late the sniper got him right in the temple. John's felt numb inside.

Speaker 2:          00:39:25       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:39:25       but to dwell on his sorrow wouldn't help. Nodding. Solemnly he leveled his finger at Captain Weddell. You are now lagoon red three but you will retain command of your company until we complete the move into these woods. Weddle equally grave replied. Yes sir. I have a little news to Lieutenant Chadwick got half his helmet knocked off by a burp gun during all that shooting a while ago. He caught either a part of his helmet or some of the slugs in his arm. He's out, but he isn't hurt badly. He'll be back. Major John's who'd never met Chadwick merely nodded again. It didn't hurt so much when you didn't know the man. Furthermore, a wound regardless of its severity, lack the awful finality of death. Chadwick's temporary loss meant one less officer, whereas new comes death left a hole in his heart. Although he knew weddell would probably be good. S three to Newcomb in the four short days he had known him, had become a friend. Grim sill had moved a little away from the others. He was leaning against a tree. His head down in the curve of his arms. Saab shaking his body. He a newcomer to become close friends for years and had worked together daily. The major spoke to Captain Menzer, the headquarters company commander. See the Lieutenant Grimsey is pulled off somewhere where it's quiet and give it a chance to lie down and get some rest. If he objects, tell them it's an order. I don't want to see him around anymore. Today.

Speaker 2:          00:41:06       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:41:06       Mansour, small and Dapper. Saluted sharply. Yes sir. I'll look after George. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:41:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:19       These guys are taking casualties at just an incredible amount and you know, you see a couple things in here that we've heard before. You know, you see the major realizing that that gristle he's done, he needs a break and you know, he says get them off the line, get him somewhere. He can take a break. And you also see these guys filling billets and just getting promoted. You know, battlefield promoted, the guy was all one of the company commanders Weddle he becomes the, he becomes the operations officer. Boom on the spot. It's, it's really, you can see why this book was when a hack words favorite books.

Speaker 2:          00:42:11       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:42:14       So now they're, they're holed up for a while and here we go back to the book, 10 days, drag by wall. The battalion sat in Boyda breadwinner if the days where sometimes doll, they were rarely uneventful. Men were wounded or killed nearly every day by artillery mortars or the fire from self prepaid. It propelled 88 that could move unseen into positions from which they could fire into the tops of trees of the Blah and then pull back before the artillery men could bring fire on them.

Speaker 1:          00:42:45       Those casualties were bad enough, but they were to be expected. There was one incident that the battalion commander thought they could have got along very nicely without regimen and directed that the battalions erect Barb wire along their whole front, which they did cheerfully, but when a truck load of anti personnel mines came down, the major looked at them with misgivings. Those things were as dangerous to the people who laid them as those as they work to the enemy. He thought so. He supervised the mind lane carefully, meticulously noting the location of each mine on a large scale sketch of the area being mined. The day after all the mines were laid, he heard the flat multiple muffled roar of a landmine at once. He ran toward the sound. He got there with the aid men to watch with sorrow and anger while they evacuated. Three men from the middle of their own mind field. One of them was dead. The last litter carried our period who badly hit in the legs with several fragments, did not know how severely he was hurt. The other wounded men unconscious was being placed on the medical jeep when still another literal came around the corner of the little farm house that stood on the edge of the woods. The man on this litter had his eyes closed, his face twisting horribly. He jerked over. He jerked all over bringing his legs up so hard. The aid men had to hold them down on the litter. The major looking at the man and wonder, asked, what's the matter with him?

Speaker 1:          00:44:23       The eight men were contemptuous. Ah, said one. This guy never got hit by nothing. He was in a whole 50 yards from where it happened, but he started screaming and yelling and carrying on something awful. We thought he was hit, but he ain't got a hole in him. He was like this. When we got to him, John's realized he had just seen his first case of neuro psychosis commonly called combat exhaustion or c II. It wasn't the only one he was to see. So you got, well I guess that's is that friendly fire friendly fire when you hit one of your own landmines night

Speaker 3:          00:45:11       mirror

Speaker 1:          00:45:14       now. And also that you start seeing some, some psychological damage to guys on the, on the front line. And you know, that guy's not going to be any good. He can't fight. He's literally screaming and jerking around. They have to hold him down.

Speaker 1:          00:45:37       All right, now the battalion is going to move in and take over a whole area, um, from the third armored division and it's in moving into this area. It's got 300 replacements coming in. So, so think about that. Battalion supposed to be 900 people and they're getting 300 replacements. So that tells you, and again, I am breezing, I'm skipping, I'm not even breathing, I'm not breezing through. I'm skipping so much of the fighting and combat in this book, but it's just going on continuously. And at this point they're going in, they have, they already have 300 replacements. So they've, they've had 300 people, uh, you know, taken out or, or either either wounded or killed. So at this point, Lieutenant Ryan's company is on a patrol and they're going to go set up an outpost into some pretty, pretty rough area. And as the patrols out there, here we go.

Speaker 1:          00:46:40       Then came the first shots from the patrol. They were going in well and it looked for a few seconds as if Ryan was going to get to his outpost. But a flare of three red star clusters floated up from the German lines and all hell broke loose again. Every kraut gun that had been used to help stop the third armored plus, probably a few that had come in late, opened up on about 150 yards of a, of the able company front. It was concentrated thunderous murder, such as no one in the battalion had ever seen before. Ryan's line was a massive saving leaping flame that looked as if it were fed from below rather than from an inconceivable torrent of shells that came on and on and on. The barrage switch suddenly from the company to the Battalion Command Post area itself, the battalion commander and his staff hearing the first wine to the shells dived for the new command post hole where they huddled walk while the walls shuttered and dirt rain down from the roof. Concussion blew out the candles, but nobody was hurt. The German gunners switch to c company for a few rounds then right, went right back to their prime target able company.

Speaker 3:          00:48:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:48:01       While they were pounding Kenny's company, a single short call came in over the 300 which is their radio able. Six is clipped. That meant Ryan had been hit, but there were no details. 20 minutes after that pretty red star cluster went up. All was quiet again, except for some moans and cries for medics that floated back from able company, but at least know Germany. Infantry had come in under fire in the 20 in that 20 minutes, the company lost 54 men plus it's company commander. Almost every man in the patrol had been caught above ground and was killed or wounded while most of the other casualties came from tree and hedge row bursts that sent fragments down into the holes. The men of the command post group gathered around the whole silently watch the parade of walking wounded that filed slowly by on the way to the aid station. Occasionally a man would stumble or waiver, whereupon a messenger or wire man would jump to help him. Every aid man and litter in the battalion was already up at the abl line and the first litters were not far behind the walking wounded. Some of the victims moaned and a few cried out a little now and then, but most were very quiet.

Speaker 1:          00:49:23       John's was glad he could not see their faces in the dark. The last litter went by with no word from Ryan Johnson's beginning to hope he hadn't been hurt badly. When four men loomed out of the darkness, each carrying a corner of a blanket. Ryan was half sitting, half lying in the makeshift litter, gritting his teeth at the pain of the wounds in an arm and a leg. They laid the blanket down gently in front of the major who stripped off his coat and laid it over. The company. Commander Ryan managed to work up a feeble grin.

Speaker 3:          00:50:01       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:50:02       It didn't work too good, did it boss?

Speaker 3:          00:50:16       That's

Speaker 1:          00:50:21       know when you're the company, when you're the battalion commander and you come up with a plan with the company commander and you think you've everything right and you lose 54 guys in a company in 20 minutes and your company commander comes back and says, it didn't go too good, did it boss to heavy weight. Now they do end up pushing forward. They get some ground and

Speaker 3:          00:50:54       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:50:54       he's out checking and you're gonna, you're gonna find this out. And he talks about it, but he goes forward to find out what's going on and make sure the guys see him. And at one point he's checking an outpost, a little outpost where they're guarding this certain area and all the guys in the group are focused on a tank on old burned out tank that's out there in front of him and he comes up to them and here we go. Back to the book. John's pointed to the corner. Does it take all three of you to watch that tank while the whole German army could crawl up to within 10 feet of you without knowing it? The sergeants mouth dropped open. God Major. I never even thought about it after they shot at us from the tank last time. Well, you better damn straight start thinking about your flanks if you want. If you want to end up being able to think at all. I wouldn't give a damn if they knocked all three. You stupid bastards out. But if they got you, they'd have a good chance of getting into the middle of your company and I wouldn't like that. Now. Damn you start thinking

Speaker 1:          00:52:06       again. You know what? He's detached. Those guys just got shot at from those 10 that tank. They're not worried about their flank. They're worried about that tank. Another sniper being in there, another machine gunner sneaking up into it, so he's detached. He rolls up and sees, Hey, I see that you're focused on the tank, but you can't. You've got to keep thinking.

Speaker 3:          00:52:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:29       Going back to the book, orders came down during the night directing lagoon. Red Major John's first battalion of the hundred and 15th Infantry Regiment would relieve lemon read by midnight of the following day, lemon was code named for the hundred and 16th who's read first battalion was holding the line to the left of where lagoon read. It hopped off nearly three weeks before,

Speaker 1:          00:52:52       so they're growing up to relieve and and hold the line they're going up to do, to take positions and hold them. Meeting the commander of this, of this group that they're taking the place of back to the book, the big commander introducing himself, shook hands all around, they need, took a deep breath and started in on a careful detailed briefing fellows. He said, this is a hot spot. I know you've all been in hot lots of them before, but please take my word for it. This one is really hot. He paused and looked at the as if to make sure they were going to take his word for it. Then he went on. We've got Nazi paratroopers on the other side of the hedge rows. They're the best that Hitler has and they know it. They don't give us much rest. We don't give them any.

Speaker 3:          00:53:43       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:53:43       we have casualties every day, so please do your best not to cause any more than we have to take. Anyway. My boys had been here for two weeks now and they're getting right touchy. So if any of you get snapped that don't take, don't pay attention to it, just go on and they'll get over it. So this guys guys are pretty burnt out at this point

Speaker 1:          00:54:10       and they do this, they do this turnover and he goes out and, and again, the turnover happens, there's more combat, there's more casualties. And then he's going out, but they'd, things settled down and he's going out to check the line. And here we go. Back to the book as Usual Major. John's asked a number of men how they were getting along. He got one answer that surprised him and sergeant said, Welser, everything's okay. It's a tough spot. But I figured where as good as any other outfit to hold it down and somebody's got to do it. But I sure wish the major would get around and see us more often. Does the men a world of good to see you down here in the lines? The major who had fought, he was getting around about as often as any battalion commander should were seriously concerned because this sergeant didn't seem to think so.

Speaker 1:          00:54:57       Instead of being annoyed, he was pleased that the man had the uncommon guts to say what he thought whether or not he was right. So there you go. Battalion commander instead of getting all mad that this sergeant says something, he's actually thankful he answered. Okay Sarge, you'll see me around a lot more in the future. The sergeant saluted sharply, whereupon stone. This is new company commander stone and the major went on stone trying to stammer out and apology for the Brash Sergeant Johns. Cut Him off, but not before stone had volunteered the statement that he himself thought the major got around more than any other battalion commander. He never seen the fact that stone had not seen petty battalion commanders did not escape Johns who smiled to himself as the company commander lapsed into an embarrassed silence.

Speaker 1:          00:55:48       On the way back to battalion. You reviewed his own approach to the problem of leadership. He knew that he must prove himself, especially his courage to every man in the outfit if he expected to get the maximum from them. He felt that he had done so fairly effectively as far as seed company was concerned because he stayed with them that night for the counter attack, the that had threatened their left flank. Also, his personal intelligence service told him that a company had approved the little battle he and grim Sul and Martin had had with a machine that it killed Jimmy and Sadler. So he's got his own. You like notice that his personal intelligence service, that means he's got, I, I've talked about this before, where you got your own guys that are telling you what's going on. So his own little guys had told them that a company, they respected him and they knew he was going to get after it back to the book, but it was apparent that this was going to be a company by company proposition. Baker company didn't seem to be impressed. He'd have to do something about that.

Speaker 3:          00:56:56       Now

Speaker 1:          00:56:58       this is just another thing about leadership there. He's on a field phone and again I talked about how they put these wires in and he's on a field phone and he gets done making something happen on the field phone to puts down the phone on the table. The phone rang before anyone could say anything. John's picked it up barking red six. That's his call side. The operators voice came through clearly. Are you finished? Yes, I am. He slammed it back on the table where it all shook his head. You forgot to ring off. Major Sergeant Wilson gives the operators hell if they don't make sure the lines are clear. Sergeant Wilson was the acting communications officer. The original man had been killed and Wilson was doing a fine job. He'd been in for a commission for quite a while. John's picked up the phone and twisted the crank on the leather case.

Speaker 1:          00:57:42       The operator answered instantly. Yes sir. What's your name? Operator private Henderson, sir. The voice was a little uncertain. Okay. Private Henderson, you keep doing your job the way you're supposed to. Don't mind me if I snap at you once in a while. I'm sorry. He finished. He started to lay the phone down, smiled, picked it up and added, finished. So again, you can see he's a guy that doesn't get all crazy. When, when you know, when people come to him and say, Hey, you're supposed to sign off the line. I got to keep these lines open. You're not signing off the line. Are you done? You see EGOMANIAC leaders do that. Get crazy on stupid stuff. They're not following their own rules.

Speaker 1:          00:58:32       Now talking about this network, uh, talking about these communications here we go back to look this, this network of communications enabled three men to keep accurate minute by minute track of all that was going over on the entire front, covered by nearly 600 men from this one spot. They could direct the lives of all those men actors in the most thrilling and awful drama of all time. So the way that they're doing this, and I should have explained this earlier, is you have the, the battalion commander and he has a small staff of people that stay with him. Most of the time his operations officer has communications officer, his intelligence officer. And what they do is when they get to certain positions, they find a command post, a CP. And when they're in the field, what they do is they dig a big giant foxhole and they make it as good as they can that they put logs over the top of it.

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       They put dirt on top of that or sand bags or something. So they're pretty, they, they're trying to get pretty secure in there from overhead artillery attacks. And then they run wires out to set up communications with all these, all the company commanders who have their own little command posts and obviously this thing isn't permanent because it has to be mobile because tomorrow night, the next night we might move another thousand yards or 500 yards and then that that foxhole that we'd row Doug isn't doing us any good anymore, but from this little command post that they set up there, they're running this whole show. Now he talks about his decision making here back to the book. If he made a wrong decision, he could cause men to lose, lose their lives needlessly or if he was clever or lucky, he might by moving a single squad or platoon or calling for fire support, defeat the enemy and gain additional glory for the unit all without moving from his communications.

Speaker 1:          01:00:18       When in a defensive position such as this. Then he's talking to her about like some of that drama that happens back to the book. A single rifle shot could mean the death of a company commander or it could mean nothing. A mortar round might wipe out an outpost and lay a company open to a surprise attack, or it might only kick up a little dust and scar. A few trees, volley of artillery fire could come through the roof over their heads or it could burst harmlessly in the fields outside. A burst of fire from the orchard could mean another pig because they had killed some pigs that they thought were enemy or a full scale German attack. Each sound built up a certain amount of suspense to greater or lesser degree. The ring of the phone itself built the tension higher and higher until the first words that came in would perhaps screw it even tighter or dispel it entirely.

Speaker 1:          01:01:19       So that's the life that they're living and just high pressure all the time. But you know, you hear a massive explosion and this is the same thing I think Lafe was talking about on the podcast. You know, you'd hear an explosion, you have no idea what it is. You don't know if it's friendly, you don't know if it's a tank round being fired. You don't know if it's an IED going off. You don't know if it's a a mortar round impact, you can't, it maybe, maybe these guys got to a point where they can tell the difference. But I'll tell you what, you get in an urban combat and there's, the sound is refracting off all the buildings. It's hard to tell where it came from and it's definitely hard to tell what it is. And by the way, the artillery rounds that hit our water's being used as ids. So you don't know what it is. It's really hard to tell. But it was weird too in, in, in Ramadi, there was constantly on fire. Like you, when you went outside, you just hear bonded.

Speaker 1:          01:02:19       He was always out there, you know, even if it was even, it was on the other side of the city. I mean you, you can, maybe not the other side of the city, but if it was in downtown Ramadi and we were back at our base, you know, we'd go up on the rooftop of my building and sit there and you could just tracers all night, you know, the marines down in the government center, we're getting attacked for the 14th night in a row, you know, the outpost, the, the army soldiers or camp Corregidor was getting mortared. I mean, it was just constant Lee happening. So what was it where you, if it's closer, that's when it's the concern or context in general or, no, just the, yeah, this, the overall context for us. For me it was like, okay, you know, you just, you just knew that there was constant fighting going on or something was going on.

Speaker 1:          01:03:04       And yeah, I mean obviously if it was closer than the, the louder it is and the closer it is, the more of a concern it because certain, yeah, he talks about, again, this is a subject we hear about all the time. Uh, the German mortars and gunners must've registered too because they had the exact range of every foot of hedgerow held by the battalion on the 10th of July. They covered almost every foot of the hedge row. That's sort of gunnery was rough on the men they never knew in the first round would fall, but once it had splattered with its flat crash, they all knew that six or maybe a dozen more were coming each one a little further up or down the hedge row. When you heard that first one, you pulled the bottom of your fox hole right up to your belly and prayed. When you heard the second one, you knew whether or not they were coming your way.

Speaker 1:          01:04:00       If they were coming towards you, it got right rough. Each round was a little closer and they were so damned deliberate about it that the waiting was worth worst than the crash of the shell itself. You laid there and counted the seconds between the shells until you knew that the next one was yours. The 20 seconds or so was the longest one in the world because you never knew if you were safe until the shell hit. It could hit anywhere outside your whole, even a matter of inches, and you're okay if it hit in the hole with you, you'd never know it. Of course, actually only a few shells ever made direct hits on Fox holes, but some did and nearly every man had seen a fox hole that had been hit. There was always the little tail fin section left on the surface and after the litter bearers had come and gone, there was only a pool of dark muck to show that somebody had been in the hole.

Speaker 1:          01:05:01       It happened twice that day. So this one you can, I don't know if you quite followed what's happening. These guys are in a hedge row. So when they're in a linear position, right, and the way you work mortars is you make small adjustments on them and and the way that you fire it targets when you don't know what the distance is you, you put the first one is going to be long and then you, you adjust a lot shorter. So then you come back and it's called bracketing. So you know you might come back five clicks and then that was, now you're now you hit in front of the target, now you go back, now you go forward again, four clicks, it hits a little behind the target. Now you come back three, two, one and then boom, you hit your target. So on the mortar thing, there's like the actual tool that kind of yeah, you're adjusting the elevation.

Speaker 1:          01:05:52       Yes. Up and down, a little dial. It's going up and down to to fire. At what angle? You want to find that? Yeah. So what you do is when you shoot a mortar, you, you're the first one, you go long, the second one you estimate short, and then you basically can split the difference between those two. I'm going to be pretty close and like you work with uh, a legit mortar team and the third round is going to be spot on. But what he's saying here is the Germans, they already knew the exact settings for where to put, oh, we see movement at this part of the head road. They don't need to take, they just go to their predesignated settings. They can put a round right on that. So they kind of figured it out beforehand and figured out beforehand they know the exact cause of what you, what'd you have to, you know the distance?

Speaker 1:          01:06:36       Yeah. You know the distance that the mortar shoots at a certain elevation. But what they don't know is if you're trying to shoot at something that you don't know exactly where it is, well then you have to estimate the distance, which is a little bit challenging to do. Now. A good sniper or a good mortar, men are going to be pretty close. You know, snipers know that, hey, this thing Vic, get it down to really, you know how many meters it is and same thing with a good mortar man, but even that, you know when you're talking about a far distance of 800,000 meters, you might be off by 50 meters and that's, you know, being off by 50 meters with a mortar is a big distance. Not going to kill the target that you're trying to hit. But with these Germans at this point, they already have everything measured and dial.

Speaker 1:          01:07:16       They have a range card is what we call it. Arrange card means like I know exactly I'm, when you set up in a position, you could have your range finder and you find out what the range and distance of everything they were looking at. So you know exactly how far it is. You can dial in your scope. Boom, oh, I see somebody over at that corner of that building that's 832 meters. Boom, crack. Remember the game battleship. Remember that? I do remember that. They'll have a ship. Yeah. It's like you can't see it, but you, and you're trying to figure it out a little bit. It is your, you're basically, your first round is going to be a little bit, if you hit something, then you got to adjust those. Yeah. So what the Germans, like I said, the Germans had these things preregistered and then what they would do is they would just drop, they would just hit the whole hedge row.

Speaker 1:          01:07:56       They go right down the life. And these guys knew that once the first round goes, it's either going to be moving away from me on the hydro or toward me. Oh yeah. Yeah. And so can you imagine the, the damn pressure when you're sitting there, that first round goes, and now the next round, where's it gonna be further away from me? Meaning the Germans are going to die, are dialing away from me, right? Or are they dialing towards me? Yeah. And then how many rounds are they going to go? Because if they do enough rounds, you're, you're going to be all right. You're, you're not there. The game. That's exactly what the Hala and what's interesting is those, like he said, if the, if the mortar hits outside of your foxhole by an inch, you're probably going to be okay because the mortar blast goes up and out when it hits the ground. If it hits in your foxhole, your dead, and so there's this, this kind of randomness that you're dealing with.

Speaker 3:          01:08:51       All right.

Speaker 1:          01:08:53       Going back to the book a little after the after 1700 general Gearhart came striding through the trees behind the company post hole. He came on serious business that of giving orders for an attack. If he carried them by himself, they were important gentlemen. He said with the edge to his voice that was impressive. The division attacks tomorrow at zero 600 all along the line. This is the drive for St Lo. There were a few details of Italians would attack as the general ad set at zero 600 the first battalion would advance into southwesterly direction with the village of Bel Fontaine as its initial objective. That was about all of them was to it except for the usual information concerning artillery support supplies, location of regimental command post and that sort of thing. So pretty pretty broad orders like, hey, this is what we're going to do. We're an attack tomorrow, zero 600 the mission is to get St Lo

Speaker 3:          01:09:53       hmm

Speaker 1:          01:09:57       back to the book. By the time the order got down to the platoon leaders in their part, their part was pretty simple. All Day in turn had to say was, all right gang, let's take the next hedge row. When the company commanders had gone, the staff discussed the plan of attack. The question bothering John's most of all was where to put the advanced command post group. He wanted to hold casualties to the barest minimum, yet he wanted to be as far forward as possible. So he's talking about where should he actually positioned himself and his small team of battalion staff. Where should they position themselves? It's funny too because when we talk about battalion staffing, are you talking about, I don't know, a battalion staff can be pretty big when you're in a big battalion, but this is not a big group. This small group especially because they've taken so many casualties back to the book.

Speaker 1:          01:10:45       There were a number of good reasons for this in the first place. Keeping the command group close to the companies made a lot of difference in communications, particularly in this close wooded country. A clump of heavy trees are a high hydro could spell the margin between having contact and not having it. That was of supreme importance. Second, if you had, and this is why I was talking about keeping the plan simple cause when you start getting split up from people and you can't maintain communications with them, the difference between not having communication and having communications is is night and day. It's disaster and success. It's victory and defeat. [inaudible] back to the book. Second, if he had to move a Bhag, if he had to move to a bog down company or to any trouble spot, he wanted to have the shortest possible distance to go.

Speaker 1:          01:11:34       So he wants to be close enough to have good communication. So he also wants to be close enough that if something's going wrong, he can get there and make things happen. Third, the group couldn't afford to stay far behind in any event because they fully expected the German paratroopers to close in around them. As soon as they started to advance. If the command post group, we're too far from the rifle companies, it would have a good chance of getting caught off and destroyed or captured. Then there was always the consideration that the men like to know that the old man was not far behind and to see him once in a while when the stuff was flying around. So these are things he's considering. They're getting ready, you know, it's now getting closer to the attack. Back to the book, the staff was uneasy. They didn't want to turn in. They couldn't say why there had been other nights like this. They all sensed that everyone shared their own nameless fears.

Speaker 1:          01:12:30       Now they start their movement. Suddenly a terrific firing broke out every German cannon mortar rifle and machine gun that fired around that day cut loose simultaneously. The sound of mortars coughing on the German side, blended with the scream of incoming shells, grim Salon Hoffman slid down the steps the whole before the first round is hit, the phone rang major, John's grabbed it. Red Six Charlie six or we're catching hell down here with mortars and artillery. I think the, I think there's enemy infantry coming in under the fire. So the idea is cover and move you. You do this as an infantry platoon or company or a battalion. You put suppressive fire. So you start launching mortars at your enemy and then while they're all taking cover you advance. And so that's what he's talking about. He says, I think there's enemy infantry coming in under the fire stone broke in the operator having wisely since the crisis and cut them into the circuit. So the other company commander now tunes in same here, major only. I know there's infantry coming in. They're already in the road with us, so they're just about to get some, his voice and manner were normally extremely quiet and easy going. Now his tone was strident with urgency. Had it been anyone but Julian stolen the major might fought it, showed near panic, okayed the both of you. He answered as calmly as he could. Stuff's coming in here to fight him and keep me informed.

Speaker 3:          01:14:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:14:06       Major John's doesn't get excited about stuff very often. He says, oh, you're attack. Cool. Fight him. Keep me informed. That's how you eat. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:14:21       Now at some point, all the wires that I talked about that were so important for communication, the crowd back at the aid station, they had a cat and the captured a guy cried Weddle suddenly he must have been part of patrol that came through and caught all our wires. Hell, there haven't been enough shells to failing falling to cut them. All the smart bastards. They even knew when we checked radios as well. So these guys set, a small group of Germans went through the lines are probably right after a radio check caught all the wires.

Speaker 3:          01:14:59       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:15:02       that's, that's how you kick off a, uh, an attack, right? You screw up their communications. Now at this point they are, this is turning bad, real bad. And, and this is, again, there's so much great information in here and so such good documentation of way this combat takes place. But suffice it to say at this point, I'm skipping forward. They are getting really crushed. They got mass casualties. They are there when they advance. So imagine this, remember I talked about the Germans know exactly where they're mortars are going to hit. Well the Americans will storm forward and fight harder and get to another hedge row when they get to this new hedge row where the Germans were, where they just beat the Germans out of there. The Germans have that hedge row dialed as well. So, so now as soon as they get positioned, they started getting immediate effective fire from mortar.

Speaker 1:          01:16:06       So this is a total nightmare and that's what's happening. And at this point they're completely bogged down. And this might be, you don't get to hear a story like this very often. So the regimental executive Colonel Smith, Lieutenant Colonel Smith shows up. So above the chain of command of the battalion is the regiment and the senior person in the regiment is the kernel, the regimental commander, and this is his executive. The person that one down from the regimental commander is this guy, Lieutenant Lieutenant Colonel Smith, and he shows up and here's what he says, what's the matter? John's, why aren't you getting anywhere? Smith gasped and this gasp because he's running into this position, the major point to the bloody trail, to the dead men, to the shells that were savaging the trees and finally in the direction of the nearby front from which came the plotting sound of mortar fire, his eyes were lacking, their usual snapped and he answered [inaudible] they're too tough.

Speaker 1:          01:17:14       Smith blinked several times. He was obviously trying to think of something to say something that would inspire this listless battalion commander to new effort. Well, he finally brought out, you got to get going right away. Regimen has got to move. You just got to get going. John's shook his head. He wasn't having any, not today was all he would say. So we're talking mentally defeated at this point, and even the, the regimental commander coming in, or the regimental executive commander coming in telling him, hey, you got to move. You just got to go. Which is that, that encouragement, this reminds me of, of in Jujitsu tournaments, you ever seen your coach saying like, you got to get on top, you got to do something. I've got to get out of there. Yeah, that doesn't help me. So that's what he's saying. Hey you, you just got to go.

Speaker 1:          01:18:07       I'm getting mortared. My guys are getting mowed down. I'm not, I can't do it. So back to the book then. For some reason, both men looked up the hedge row toward the rear colonel McDaniel, the new division chief of staff was striding toward them, oblivious of the fire. Just as he reached the command post, a volley of four rounds screamed in the field just beyond the headrow. The concussion tumbled them into the hole with the major and Smith. But MCDANIEL did not lose his natural dignity. And he was smiling as he said, Hello John's Smith, how are we doing now? We got a leader coming in that's very calm and very cool and just got blasted into their whole, by the way, and he looks up smiles and says, how are we doing? John's made an effort to perk up a bit, but as voice lacked conviction or forces, he told McDaniel all about the situation. The chief of staff survey the scene, weighing it all very carefully. It'd be before he answered, when he did, his tone was serious and he was not smiling.

Speaker 1:          01:19:11       John's when you were on maneuvers in Louisiana or at Vmi and while you were studying at Leavenworth, you saw situations where units had to be sacrificed knowingly in order to get a job done, didn't you? The battalion commander nodded. When you saw those things, you probably never thought very much about them. Just accepted them as a matter of course in war, didn't you? The major nodded. Again, you never stopped to think probably that there might come a time when you and your unit would be the one that had to be sacrificed to enable the parent unit to accomplish its mission. The majors eyes were opening wider as he shook his head. Well, I don't know for sure, but maybe this is that time. I do know that this is the highest ground on the core front and the key to the entire defense is St Lo core express expects us to break it and we think you are the man to do the job at whatever cost. Now don't let us down without another word. He got to his feet and walked back the way had come. The regimental executive tagged after him. John's watched them go. Suddenly he remembered that the general, what the general had said to him the day before, I'm counting on you. He turned to Weddell who would watch this little drama with detached interest. Leroy, the major said is he squared his shoulders and pointed to the sinking son. Take a damn good look at that Sun old boy cause it's probably the last time any of us will ever see it. Let's go.

Speaker 1:          01:20:53       John's never knew later just what he did the rest of that afternoon and early evening. Can you remembered moving around the command post forward again and he knew that he had needled the company commanders unmercifully threatening them myrtle with relief of their commands, begging, pleading, anything he could think of that would work with that individual. At that moment,

Speaker 1:          01:21:17       he found that there was a comparatively weak spot in the German lines. Opposite Baker again, he badgered Martin into persuading the artillery to give them all the fire that he could hit that spot at one time. That meant a lot of guns when they all fired three rounds as fast as the gunners could load them. A hundred yards of German held hedge row went up in flame and smoke and dust again. Most of Baker companies streamed across the field and into the gap blasted by the artillery that took the heart out of the paratroopers and the paratroopers. He talking about our German paratroopers who began to fall back all along the line. It was no route. The Germans retired from their flanking threat baker post having gained a place in their main line, but they fell back slowly fighting every foot of the way. The tenacious paratrooper slowed the weakness the weekend battalion again, but they could not stop it entirely. The company commanders and the platoon leaders together with the battalion CEO had thrown off their apathy, taken a second wind, and we're not to be denied at dark thanks to the inspired leadership that had been provided in a few short minutes by Colonel Mcdaniel. The German line was broken beyond repair. Battered American battalion had made 500 bloody yards

Speaker 1:          01:22:39       as dusk faded into darkness. That firing began to diminish only to flare briefly again on the left. Then it died away into silence. Kenny called in. Kenny called in to say there had been a light counter attack on the left flank. He had easily kicked it off. The major did not ask for permission to halt the advance. He gave orders to dig in for the night after. He was sure the companies had close contact on their flanks. So there you go. That that's just an amazing account of not only of leadership, but if what leadership was capable of. I mean, John's was pretty much done. He's literally saying, not today. They're too tough in the way that make Danial convinces him and explains to him that, you know, those times, those times when you were doing exercises and you why they'd sacrifice a unit to, that they can accomplish the mission. I'm not sure, but I think you're that unit right now and we're counting on you to get it done. Unbelievable. You know, that's, uh, that's one of those things too where that's where you're, that's where, you know, from a leadership perspective, you are now,

Speaker 1:          01:24:20       you know, entering a situation where duty is going to be the most important thing to you. And you also know that

Speaker 1:          01:24:29       the mission is the most important thing. You've got to, you've got to put that at the top of your priorities. And you know, you're going to sacrifice guys and it's going to be a nightmare. But the alternative, the alternative is you're not gonna win. You're gonna, you're not gonna win. That's the alternative is that your team is not going to be able to achieve this. And, and you know, at this point in the war, this war was not settled yet by any stretch. This world was not settled. And so to give up ground and start to, to let the Germans reorganize and let them start to gain high ground, which is what they were fighting for here. Hmm. That's not just going to affect your mind. It's going to affect everybody. And so I've said this on the podcast before, the definition of a team is when the members of the team think the team is more important than themselves. And that's what you see right here. They realize, John's realize, realizes that, look, we're going to be, and the title the book is Clay Pigeons. You know what a clay pigeon is, right? Yes. That's what you throw up in the air. And she would add, and it's just, it's a sacrificial piece of clay. And that's why the name of the book is the clay pigeons. The St Lo because that's in many cases, the situation that they're in.

Speaker 3:          01:25:53       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:25:59       So this is, this is different then when Napoleon says, Hey, if you get told to do something and it's not smart and you do it anyways, you're culpable. Yeah. John's, he can't say, look, no, this isn't smart. He knows it's the right thing to do. He know that's, that's the big difference that I'm trying to get at here. This isn't a guy who's saying, look, hey, we're going to charge this machine gun nest and I'm gonna lose it. You know, half my platoon, but it's not going to make any big deal. And I'm a, I'm a bad leader because I sacrificed my platoon for a meaningless machine gun nest. This is a guy that knows that this objective is important, knows that this high ground is needed, knows that the success of this, not just this mission, but the success of this whole, this whole assault on France and thereby Germany is riding on what they're doing.

Speaker 2:          01:26:53       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:26:55       Now you could break it down and say, well, you know, they made, they could hold back and they could wait. Well, what happens when you hold back and wait? Do the Germans have meat? More reinforcements that they're sending their way that you know what's, what does that actually mean? And so he is calculated. It is mine. You know what? We need to do this for the good of everyone. We need to do this

Speaker 1:          01:27:22       at one point. Now fast forwarding past some more of that fighting. They, they do a good job of kind of of the they've, they've knocked out some of the, through through some fierce fighting, Dave knocked out, they've moved forward and they've hold up and now they started advancing again. And here we go. Back to the book of one Peter, one well-placed, stubborn hostile machine guns stopped that flank attack cold. So they're attacking and they get stopped by one well placed machine gun. The German gunner got off, got half of the small squad that tried to rush him through the smoke and the attackers had to withdraw, dragging their wounded with them. Mortars and artillery left the German undamaged rifle grenades couldn't quite hit the narrow slit through which he was firing two grand. And deer is trying to take extra careful. Aim had also been hit by concealed German snipers.

Speaker 1:          01:28:15       When the major arrived, it looked as though progress. It stopped using the battalion radio to the rear command post and the artillery phone. From there, he adjusted 18 successive rounds from one gun of the hundred and 10th field artillery battalion in a vain attempt to sharp shoot the machine gun out of existence, but he couldn't hit it and after each round burst on or near the hedge row, the enemy would reply with a dis Derisive v burst. There was only one answer a tank and miraculously a tank appeared. So that's what I'm talking about. He's, he tries with, there's a one machine gun that's holding up this situation. He gets on the radio and cars, Terry artillery, which is similar to mortars there. They're bigger and more powerful, but it's the same thing. It's indirect fire. You're putting rounds far up in the air and then through a big arc that's going thousands and thousands of feet in some cases into the air and then coming basically straight down on a target. And it's when I say it's hard to hit a target, he's fires 18 rounds to try and hit this machine gun bunker to machine gun. Can't stop it, can't help it.

Speaker 1:          01:29:30       So he needs a tank and then miraculously and, and uh, if you don't know anything about my incredible affection for tanks and for tankers because of what they were able to do in the battle of Ramadi too, not only for themselves, but to support and save my guys time and time again. I'm a big fan of tanks. In fact, I love tanks and tankers. That's straight up. That's the way it is. And this is why, this is why right here, back to the book, one steel monster, monster lumbered up behind John's who yelled instructions to the tank commander. The gunner watched carefully while in an infantry squad beat her fire to clip of tracer bullets at the slit that hid the machine gun and then swung his short boar barreled little 75 into line. It crashed once and almost simultaneously with the muzzle blast came to crack of white phosphorous shell. As it hit the slit, the smoke blossomed up from behind a hedge row indicating a direct hit. With that, a single paratrooper came running toward them a few moments later. Everything on the front cut loose. The enemy and the company charged and another hundred yards of French real estate had changed hands.

Speaker 3:          01:30:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:30:50       And then the major, the major wished every machine gunner in his outfit could have seen that position as an illustration of what skill to nasty and guts could do to build and defend one machine gun position. So machine gunners tanks.

Speaker 3:          01:31:11       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:31:12       that's incredible. What a machine, I mean you can even, you know what a machine gun is, right between machine guns, I mean, uh, uh, a normal like a mark 48 machine gun or the old m 60 Roger Hayden talk about carrying the 60. Right. And in our boys last deployment, my last deployment to Ramadi guys are carrying mark 48 or mark 46, which is a smaller round of five five six round m 60. That's what ramble had, right? That is yes. And Command. Oh by the way, okay. I'll take your words from the Matrix to be exact. That was his knee. Oh, okay. The [inaudible], the belt fed machine gun. Oh yeah. They're, they're not that big of a weapon. I mean, it's big and blood true. Believe me, when you're carrying an 802,000 rounds, it's big enough. But if you think about a whole, you know, a battalion worth guys are getting stopped by a guy in a machine gun in a good position.

Speaker 1:          01:32:03       Now he had snipers, snipers covering him. Two snipers apparently recovered him. But that's, that's, that's not many people. That's why when you're on the offense, you need more people then being in a defense position, you know, a defect. When you're in a defense defensive position and you're allowed to, you have time to set up. That's why when you go back to, well, when you look at, normally when you look at this whole, if you look at World War II as a whole, both the the allies in what we did in, in Normandy, taking the beaches and what you did every time in a Pacific, taking the beaches, you're going against bunkered positions like this fully, and it's just incredible the tenacity that it takes to make this happen. Yeah. Isn't that the whole, in a way, the whole idea behind behind guerrilla warfare where it's like we're just, we're kind of fighting, we're not fighting it, and then all of a sudden we're finding that that is the, that is behind guerrilla warfare, but this isn't guerrilla warfare.

Speaker 1:          01:33:01       Yeah. Even without even without sneaking around. Right, right. You're, you're in a uniformed soldier, German and you go, okay, I'm going to set up a bunkered position on this high ground it where I have the enemy channelized in this area and I have good spread on them and the only weak spots I've got, I'm going to cover him with snipers. Yeah. Three people holding up a battalion and just think, you know, if he, if then once you get that position, we have mortars already dialed in when you get there that are going to start hitting you and then the next thing you do is you got to move again. Well, guess what? We got another three, four, five guys in machine gun positions mutually supporting each other.

Speaker 3:          01:33:39       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:33:40       That's why this, this, these American allied fighting forces and the Americans here and the Americans in the Pacific going against hardened bunkered positions is incredible. Yeah, it's incredible.

Speaker 1:          01:33:58       Now he's given kind of an overview of war and end. Here we go. Thus goes battle, a rush, a pause, some creeping, a few isolated shots here and there. Some artillery fire, some mortars, some smoke more creeping, another pause, dead silence, more firing, a great concentration of fire followed by a concerted rush. Then the whole process starts all over again. The defender, this is good. This is good information. The defender will almost always hold out some reserve, even though his front line is being torn to bits. At least he should. He may inflict all the damage on the attacker that he can while giving ground slowly. Then when he thinks the attacker is weakening or when the defense has reached a certain piece of ground that the defender has chosen for the purpose, he launches a counter attack with his reserves. The attacker has used much of his strength. His men are tired, probably short of ammunition and are almost inevitably somewhat disorganized. Then the defender throws fresh troops into a counter attack. Overground his men, no,

Speaker 1:          01:35:10       unless the attackers are very strong, they must inevitably suffer often than they are defeated and thrown back or destroyed. So there, there you go. I mean this happens in mixed martial arts. It happens in sports, it happens on the battlefield and these guys are pushing forward on the attack and you take away leaves, you chip away at them a little bit, you give them ground, you give them ground and then when they, when they get spread out, they're low on ammunition, boom. Then you hit them on a counter attack on ground that you already know back to the book. Such counter attack tactics have been standard almost as long as there have been organized armies. The Germans employed them so regularly that they were never a surprise, but the enemy could never muster, seem to muster the strength necessary to make their counter attacks stick. Their efforts often hold it in advance as they had the night before, but they rarely gained back any ground. And we're almost always costly to the counter attackers. Even the best and most proven tactics still require judgment and the force to do the job. The Germans rarely had enough of ether,

Speaker 1:          01:36:15       so there's a little breakdown on what's happening with the Germans. First of all, we're not using good judgment, they're just like standard operating procedure. We're going to counter attack every single time. And when you count her as accurate, taking losses, especially if you're not gaining ground, so their standard operating procedure, we're going to counter attack and they're not gaining ground. And so were they doing, they're losing guys.

Speaker 1:          01:36:34       And the more guys you lose, the less guys you have to counter attack with the next time. Yeah. Now they had a, they had a group here that was working in the battalion. They were called the commandos. It was just like a little elite group that they were using. They would guard the command post, but then they would also, when someone's going down, they'd get out there and get after it. Super aggressive, but they were running so low on people that they needed to put the commandos team back out into the companies, the regular companies. So there had been a little commando unit, a little special unit within the battalion, and then they had to take those guys and put them back out with the, with the regular companies. Now here we go back to the book in the middle of the afternoon, the CEO moved up close behind a company to watch their contingent of former battalion commandos go into the line.

Speaker 1:          01:37:30       Sergeant Turner, who had made it, who had been in charge of a platoon of the command, a platoon was with them seeing the major. He fell behind long enough to say, sir, we're going in there to help our buddies from old a company lick the hell out of those bastards, but when we get through this, I'd sure like to come back and get it into a bunch of commando's for the battalion is cool. Voice ended on a rising note. All right, sergeant, you go to send to St Lo and I'll promise you get another platoon or your hell raisers just as soon as we can spare them from the companies. John's returned to the sergeants. John's returned to sergeant salutes and watched the man as he ran to catch up with the others. An hour later, a weasel, which is a small purpose tracked vehicle flying a Red Cross flag clattered out of the woods carrying a load of wounded on litters.

Speaker 1:          01:38:23       The battalion commander who was passing the spot stopped when he saw the wounded. The little commando sergeant lay on the litter on the near side, seeing the major. He yelled for the driver to stop. John's went over to him and the boy, both his legs wrapped and dirty bloody bandages, grabbed his commander shirt and pulled himself up on the litter. He was crying openly and unashamedly as he burst out with a flood of invective, they got all my boys made sure we didn't get off the LD, which is the line of departure. I let you down major, I let you down. He stopped and sobbed bitterly before you could go on major John's could feel his own throat constricting as he held the tightly gripping hands that shook him again and again as the sergeant poured out his grief and rage and disappointment, we had to get that gun.

Speaker 1:          01:39:20       Damn the dirty bastards. God Damn God. Damn. I let him get me with a fucking machine gun and they got all my boys too. God Damn. He sobbed uncontrollably while the weasel driver began to let us clutch take hold, but I'll be back major, sir. I'll be back probably back. Sure. Boy, and I'll have your old job for you anytime you just take it easy and get those legs fixed. The major was walking slowly beside the litter. Trying to gently disengage the grip on his shirt. The sergeant let go and fell back on the litter exhausted. John's looked up at the aid man who slowly shook his head. The sergeant would not be back.

Speaker 1:          01:40:18       Now they are finally pushing into St Lo and and they have to go down. This direction of attack that they're taking is down this down, this single road that heads into St Lo and the Germans have it dialed. They have it dialed with range, you know, with artillery ready to hit it and here we go. They have hit it. They're starting to hit it with big rounds. Back to the book. John's noted that the German fire was coming in slowly. There couldn't have been more than two or three guns firing as they were all big ones. They didn't fire rapidly. That was a break, but just one of those big shells in the wrong place. As the next one began to how the men began to look for deeper spots in the ditches, John's yelled, keep going, dammit. It's not here yet. The men kept going forward for several more seconds running hard. Now. The shell was nearly on the ground before the major yelled again down.

Speaker 1:          01:41:24       Although the men hit the ditches. John was too excited to remember he was in the middle of the road. He went down on one knee. The shell burst a hundred yards ahead. Again, nobody was hit. The incident at burst, the major was up, yelling, let's go. Running is he yelled, his men got up and ran to Hoffman and grist mill or grim cell catching the idea moved further back down the line of men to relate commands and call signals on the shells. When the next one hit, all three officers did the same. None of them got off the road here and they're non coms without orders began to fill in the gap staying on the road themselves. By the time the third shale hit, the whole column was working as smoothly as if it had been on a parade ground drill and they were losing no time.

Speaker 1:          01:42:13       They kept going. A few men were hit, but not many. Oddly, oddly enough, not an officer or non-com was knocked out of the middle of the road. Though each leader only went down on one knee. One Shell burst, not 25 yards ahead of the major, but it hit just around a small bend in the road and he was sheltered by the bank. He ran forward through the smoke and dust nearly falling over a man who is rolling crazily half in and half out of the ditch. John's grabbed him by the arm to help him to his feet crying. Come on boy, let's go. The man tried to get up, but stumbled awkwardly forward. Only then did John's look down and see that the soldier had no feet. He was trying valiantly to stand on the stumps of his two legs, whereas feet had been sliced cleanly off just at the ankles. John's laid him back gently into the ditch and changed his tone. Maybe you better take it easy while son, you stay here until one of your buddies gets here. There'll be a long in a minute.

Speaker 1:          01:43:16       The man himself was an aid man and not another was insight, but the battalion commander had no time for one man. So after a quick look to see that the stumps were not bleeding profusely, he patted the man on the back saying, see you later bud. Then he ran to catch up to his place in the column a little further down the road. After another burst, he saw another man lying in the ditch, not making any move to get up and go have though he didn't seem to be hurt. John Stopped, grabbed him by the arm and yelled again, come on, let's get going. Looking blankly up at him. The soldier pushed a camera forward saying, plaintiff Lee, I'm a camera man. This rock the major for a moment. Then he said, well, you can't take any pictures in that ditch. Get going. So again, you see leadership in action. You see him having to exit, actually lead and set the example and his other, the company commanders and eventually the the senior enlisted guys all follow his lead of what he's doing. We got time to run. We got a minute of water, whatever it is, 30 seconds, we're going to get up. We're going to run as hard as we can. When we, when we know we're going to get hit with a shell, we're going to get down and take cover pure leadership.

Speaker 1:          01:44:44       Now once they get kind of into st low, there's a kernel shows up, starts getting told what to do. Back to the book, the colonel was giving orders. Again, I want you to clear this town as quickly as you can. There aren't many Germans in it, but there are a few and I want it all clear. Your battalion is the only infantry we have with the task force. As you are the ranking officer, you will be in command of all the troops in town. He looked closely at the major who nodded, trying to contain the elation. He felt knowing that he would have command on the ground of what would undoubtedly be a historical action. The colonel thrust a map at him. Here's a large scale map of the town itself. Now get going. Major. John's turned to look for Wendell Weddle and Greg Muscle.

Speaker 1:          01:45:27       His two staff officers turned company commanders both. We're almost at his elbow. He drew them to one side and divided the town between them. So now they're kind of on the outskirts of St Lo and they're starting to clear the town. And we have seen the companies go out and start clearing the town and they've set up a little make shift command post for, for major Johns. And, and he's standing there with, he's got these, got a bunch of new guys with him too. He's got all these replacements. Because remember on an hour and a half ago when I said, hey, these guys have already had 300 replacements. Well that has kept up the whole time. They're getting all these replacements. So at this point, this is an interesting leadership story here. He's got some new guys that show up and there's, he's standing in his new command post and these new guys, he sees like a position that needs to be taken to make sure that, you know, we, we have some security around the command post. And so here we go. He motioned to the PFC and three other men standing nearby, they came forward, rifles ready. So these are three new guys. Just replacements. Just showed up.

Speaker 3:          01:46:32       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:46:35       And again, the probably the most fire they've seen was running into the town of St Lo, avoiding big giant how it's or shells that are hitting him back to the book. See that alley there said John's pointing. I want you to take these three men and go down to the end of it. Looks like about a hundred yards where you will set an outpost Lieutenant Lickeri. We'll come around later to see how you're doing. The PFC squinted down the alley, nodded a trifle uncertainly and started toward it. The others followed but the major was too preoccupied, preoccupied to note that there have been no briefing and no assignment of positions or duties. They just trooped off down the alley together like a bunch of men going to the post exchange. Two minutes after they left the sound of German machine gun fire came from the direction of the narrow passageway.

Speaker 1:          01:47:20       John's turned to look out of the alley pelted the four men straight toward them. The private first class panted sir, there's a machine gun down there. The battalion commander didn't know whether to be amused or angry. There was no telling what the new men were apt to do if they didn't have leadership of an experienced are well trained non-com or officer. He decided to be gentle. Yes, I heard it. Now tell you what to do. You take these three men again assign one to take a place where he can shoot the gun or where you think the gun is. Then take the other two and see if you can't come around behind it and get it for me so they'll cover move. It was real simple. Look, cover, move you. You get where you can shoot the gun, have that guy get, we're going to shoot the gun and then you guys maneuver behind.

Speaker 1:          01:48:08       Cover move. Beautiful. The PFC took that in, nodded somewhat less uncertainly motion to the men to follow him and started purposefully back down the alley and not more than five minutes. There came in rapid succession, the sound of the machine gun, a few rifle shots, two grenades and running feet. John's had moved across the street looking for the best place for a temporary command post. He turned toward the mouth of the alley wondering what would come out. This time to Germans showed first running toward him at full speed before the major could bring a sub machine gun up. He saw the PFC and one other man prodding the Germans from behind with bayonets. They spotted him and poked the prisoner in his direction. They stopped in front of him before he noticed the MG 34 the PFC was dragging behind him, so they actually had the German machine gun.

Speaker 1:          01:49:03       The man dropped the gun in front of him saying, here's the gun you wanted major, but this is all that's left to the crew. We had to kill two of them, sir. Major John's gulped nodded and motion to gay was another one of the guys to come to get the prisoners, the private first class and his helpers jog back toward their new outpost. The major looked after them, wondering just what sort of training or indoctrination they must've had first to run away from an enemy without trying to fight back. And then to apologize for having killed too. He looked down at the German that the batter German machine gun kicked it idly and reminded himself to be more careful in issuing orders to new men. They were apt to take things a bit on the literal side. He was sure that the PFC had actually fought, that the CEO himself had a personal desire for the machine gun they had knocked out and they would have gone to any ends to retrieve the gun itself in order to bring it back. Just because the major had added that for me when he ordered them to get the gun.

Speaker 4:          01:50:10       Yeah. That's like a common thing to kind of add. Right? Like in, you know, back when he used to work at the nightclub, you'd hear that all the time, especially when you're managing big crowds. So you say, Hey, can you, you know, can you slide over on the side here for me? And they'd always add the, for me always thought like that's kind of strange thing to add. I mean, it's so common, but when you really think about it, it's like that kind of a strange thing to add, but I think it adds like this personal touch too personal.

Speaker 1:          01:50:43       All right, now he's in the command post Weddle who's one of the company commanders. These guys were out clearing the city and he hears some commotion, comes back into one of the rooms and Weddles in there with one of the other officers or one of the other, uh, yeah, officer's in there working on them. Back to the book, Brooks sobbing was carefully cutting away the officer's field jacket and shirt, exposing a wide deep gas just below the shoulder. John Stomach turned over quickly when he saw the wound, the bone was shattered with sharp, splintered and sticking through the bloody, pulpy massive torn flesh. That's, this is wet at least talking about when was damn near right. They don't almost blowed his arm plum off the s three moaned, closed his eyes as he leaned back to let Brooks duty could with a nasty wound, but he pulled himself together in a moment or two and opened his eyes to look at the CEO.

Speaker 1:          01:51:38       So here he is Weddles just in agony, but he gets, gets a grip. Then he looks at the CEO, squeezes his eyes together, hard than looks at the CEO and says, I was just coming back to tell you he'd ground out between clenched teeth that we have our side of the town all clear with the men out on the edge. When the artillery caught me in the middle of the street, he flinched. His face twisted in pain. When the aid man who had taken over from Brooks inadvertently twisted his arm as he sprinklered soulful powder into the wound, then he went on Chadwick his back. Didn't know it until I saw him came up, just came just before we pulled out out of the little road back up the hill. You can put them in command. He's good. He was gasping at the words. Now Major, can you get me Outta here? I don't want to lose this arm. Sure. Boy, we'll get you out. Just try to relax now. Don't worry about it. Take it easy and we'll have you back to where they can fix it. Up in no time. Weddle leaned heavily on Brooks, who was still sobbing from the shock of seeing his captain so badly wounded. Weddle and Brooks had been together a long time and major new, the sergeant would be no good around the command post for awhile. So we motioned him to go along and look after the wounded s three so again, you know, Major Jones realizes that somebody at their capacity for handling the horrors of war and says, Hey, you take this guy back to the aid station. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:53:10       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:53:12       now there's a German counter attacks or they're in St Lo. The Gut things decently handled, but all of a sudden they start seeing it and there's a guy in the field named Barnes and he starting to report back day. They're, they're forming up a big counter attack and also their field phones or been on the last wires. So they're don't have good communications. They see this thing forming up. They're going to be overwhelmed. They're, they're really under man's St Louis is a pretty big city. It's all kind of destroyed, but it's still too big for the amount of people that they have. And so they're really scared that there's gonna be a big counter and the terms are going to take the city back. So the finally get through. They don't even know who they're talking to, they're just trying to get through to somebody that can pass word to get the artillery just start dropping bombs.

Speaker 1:          01:53:56       And Henderson is one of the guys on the, on the radio and he says, damn it man, this is the goon red and St Lo when we've needed artillery is worse than the ever needed anything and all our lives when we need it right now, all our lines are rear all our lines to the rear out and our wire people spliced one and got you. Now quit asking damn fool questions and tell me if you can shoot for us in St Lo. So this is going back and forth. They start dropping bombs and all of a sudden they start adjusting the, the bombing closer and closer to them, to their own lines. Back to the book Angel Fire Direction Center was questioning the adjustment. The correction would bring the shells inside. The no fire line may be on friendly troops.

Speaker 1:          01:54:38       Hell yes. We got doze on the edge of town. Who Do you think wants this stuff? Anyways, the artillery man was frantic, afraid of the safety rules. The big guns would make them stop them just when they needed the most. Please sir. He pleaded, just put it out there. The Infantry Battalion Commander is standing right beside me praying for more of it. The last of all, he was right in there, but the Germans are still coming. They stand the, they get them to drop more bombs, bombs and Barnes. The guys out in the field calls back in again. That was marvelous. Do it again, some more. And then the guys transfer in that repeat range. Fire for effect. Give us all your hand and give it quick. You're breaking up the attack and you're all we have and that's enough. That's dead. They bombed the bejesus out of the Germans, and that pretty much breaks the attack. And again, I'm summing up like seven pages of extended combat. Uh, and finally though, the, the battle is for the most part over and they've got stabilized. They kind of set some security. And here we go back to the book major John's his face in his hands as he sat down for the first time in hours, he couldn't help thinking of the deaf and agony to so many men. So needlessly it hurt damnably deep inside.

Speaker 3:          01:56:08       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:56:11       And then a liaison officer for them regiment came in with a lieutenant colonel, his staff, and all of his company commanders. They were from the hundred and 34th regiment of the 35th division, which was to relieve the first battalion at once. John's could hardly believe it. Even when he saw his replacement standing there looking fresh and confident, he was beginning to think that clay pigeons were supposed to go on forever fighting all alone, except for the artillery.

Speaker 1:          01:56:42       The new battalion commander wondered about Major Stat Major John Staff. So he's got a guy coming in to take over. They're getting relieved and the guy says, you know, hey, what's up? Where's your battalion staff? Back to the book, John's explained, and as he did, he reviewed in his mind. All that had happened in the short 30 days since the first attack and the boy to tail his whole forward staff was gone. Newcomb Sadler, Carter and McCarthy dead Weddle and Hoffman wounded, grim sell out commanding a company, nab, Ryan, Todd, stolen cardiac, Kenny and Dedman, all wounded besides God knew how many other officers he, he had never even known by name. The company commanders from four companies killed or wounded mostly in the space of seven short action packed days. He stopped talking while he thought for a moment of all those fine people. When he glanced up catching himself, he thought he was looking at a ghost.

Speaker 1:          01:57:54       There stood Kenny the shadow on his face, wavering as the candle flickered and the faint breeze of his entry. So Kenny had been wounded and now he's back in an instant, has troubles his preoccupation with the route, with the relieving officers were forgotten. Kenny, he cried. When in God's name are you doing here? Well Major. I heard you got into town. All right, but we're still sort of shorter company commanders. I saw Todd deadman and cardiac back there, so I thought I'd better get on up here and see if I could do anything. The docs will let you go these days if you can stand up straight for two minutes without falling down. The major saw that Kenny was exhausted in spite of his cheerful attitude. He found out later that he had walked alone in the dark all the way from the division clearing station, several miles to the rear in order to get back to the battalion, his legs and back or covered with bandages under his new shirt and pants. You said, well old man, there isn't anything you can do right now. These nice people who've just come in, so we're going to be out of this rat trap and a little while and you just go back behind Mrs Bland Shit here and lie down and get some rest. You need it. Can. He did as he was told, the strain had begun to bend, even his indomitable will

Speaker 3:          01:59:19       at

Speaker 1:          01:59:20       zero four 40 the major reported to regiment that the hundred and 34th infantry had taken over. The wireman took out the phone, the major shook hands and said goodbye and good luck to the new arrivals. Then he and Kenny followed the companies down the hill just seven days ago. They had numbered 800 they were now only 450 proud, tired men. The clay pigeons who had taken the core objective clay pigeons and from Omaha beach to the Elb, the first battalion, hundred and 15th Infantry 29th Division had 2,384 casualties, including 454 men killed in action. That that, that's, that's hard to even fathom. Again, think about the fact that at this time a battalion was about, it's supposed to be about 900 men and they'd taken 2,384 casualties. So all the replacements that came and kept getting wounded.

Speaker 3:          02:00:54       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:00:57       Unbelievable. And what's, I mean, you, you got to read this book and get the lessons learned in, in also you get lessons learned from that book. But you can also get some of major John's lesson learned from Colonel David Hackworth in his book about face and what's you want to talk about some layers, some, some historical layers. Check this out. So in about face, you know, Hackworth talks about what happens in August 13th, 1960 the communist in Berlin started stringing barbed wire and they were now going to build a wall between east and West Berlin. And they, you know, Kennedy who was president wanted to do something like you can't just, you know, we need to do, we need to make some kind of a statement here. So he sent 1500 soldiers from the first battle group of the Eighth Infantry Division and they were selected apparently by Kennedy, by name. So Kennedy said, I want these guys. And the reason is because their commander was a guy name Glover, s John's. And he wanted them to go and reinforce the British, French and American troops who were on the ground in Berlin. And then layers. Colonel John's in his position appointed d company in his battle group, he pointed d company to be the battle groups reaction force

Speaker 1:          02:02:47       and who was the commander of d company. It was a young Korean War veteran who had come back into the army named captain at the time, David Hackworth. And as I said, Hackworth points to Glover Johns as his primary source for leadership lessons learned and he captured them coming succinctly from Glover Johnson himself eight about face. So let's take it back to that book for a minute here.

Speaker 3:          02:03:28       Okay,

Speaker 1:          02:03:32       from about face all too soon, Colonel John's received orders back to Berlin as chief of intelligence. So now this whole thing that they'd gone through with sending this, this forced to reinforce the French British and in American troops on the ground in Berlin, this is pretty much done all too soon. Colonel Jones received orders back to Berlin as chief of intelligence. Most of us had known the magic couldn't last forever, but it didn't change the fact that we were incredibly sad to see him go on 15 January, 1962 the battle group fell out smartly for its final review before our favorite soldier, the weather was bitterly cold, but no one noticed we were all too busy standing tall and greedily soaking in the colonel's farewell address. John's was a leader who taught by example. So most of the points he made weren't exactly new to us. But to hear it in a single speech, this great man's basic philosophy of soldiering was like being led down, letting in on the secret ingredients of some magical formula to wit strive to do small things well,

Speaker 3:          02:04:50       okay,

Speaker 1:          02:04:51       be a doer and a self starter. Aggressiveness and initiative are two most admired qualities in a leader. But you also must put your feet up and think so there's a little dichotomy he's hitting on. Yeah, you gotta be aggressive, but you've got to think. Strive for self improvement through constant self evaluation. Got To be humble, never be satisfied. Ask of any project. How can it be done better? Don't over inspect or over supervise. Allow your leaders to make mistakes and training so they can profit from the errors and not make them in combat. Decentralized Command. Keep the troops informed, telling them what, how and why. Builds their confidence.

Speaker 3:          02:05:52       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:05:53       The harder the training, the more the troops will brag. Boom. Remember that guy that asked the last podcast, how do I improve the morale of a, of a group? Get them, get them to have that pride. Train hard. Next enthusiasm, fairness and moral and physical courage. Four of the most important aspects of leadership,

Speaker 1:          02:06:18       enthusiasm, fairness and moral and physical courage. Next, showmanship of vital technique of leadership. That's interesting. And there's a bunch of an about face Hackworth. He, he specifies some of these things that he would, that, that uh, Glover Johns would do showmanship wise. He'd walk down the range and he was a really good shot with a rifle. And apparently he would have a guy throw a quarter, like a coin up in the air and he'd shoot it because he was such a good shot. That. And another thing he did, he's, he's about to give a speech somewhere and in sort of a mixed audience, but bunch of German, um, sort of political people. Glover, John's gets up and just gives the speech in German. All right. Next, the ability to speak and write, well, two essential tools of leadership. Boom. Next, there is a salient difference between profanity and obscenity while the leader profanity tempered with discretion. He never uses obscenities. Next, have consideration for others. Hmm. Next, yelling detracts from your dignity. Take your medicine side and counsel them. Next, understand and use judgment. Know when to stop fighting for something you believe is right. Discuss and argue your point of view until a decision is made and then the support, the decision wholeheartedly.

Speaker 1:          02:08:14       Last, stay ahead of your boss.

Speaker 2:          02:08:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:08:19       When John's had finished colonel couch gave the order to pass and review and company by company, we marched by with just that little extra precision. Our shoes, uniforms and brass earlier attended to to provide just that little extra sparkle. As was the custom the company commanders peeled off after their units passed in the review stand and congregated for final goodbye. John's had watched the parade with tears in his eyes. The tears remained as he stood at attention.

Speaker 2:          02:09:01       Okay,

Speaker 1:          02:09:05       so tears in his eyes. That is major Glover, John's, that is the clay pigeons. That is the first battalion, hundred and 15th Infantry, 29th division. And obviously he is an example of leadership and the men of his battalion, the clay pigeons, they are yet a nother example of the indomitable warrior spirit and culture that is the very core of this nation. Don't forget that.

Speaker 2:          02:10:02       Okay?

Speaker 1:          02:10:03       Don't forget that culture. Don't ever forget it. And for those of you out there right now defending our nation, that spirit and that culture, it can work to hold you up and having it in your brain can keep you strong in trying times. But there's also a dichotomy there because not only does that warrior spirit and warrior culture hold you up, you also have to hold it up. You have to maintain that warrior culture in the way you think and then the way you act. And if you ever start to forget how your spokes to think and how you're supposed to act, then remember Colonel Glover Johns and the clay pigeons of St Lo.

Speaker 2:          02:11:40       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:11:42       And I think that's all I've got for tonight. Echo Charles. Yes. So I guess speaking of maintaining, yes. Maybe you could tell us how we could maintain support of this podcast if you, if you want, if they want. And for ourselves. Hey, what is fire for effect? Oh yeah, fire surely since. Awesome. So you're on a radio and you're watching, you're calling artillery or you're calling a naval gunfire or you're calling air support and you're trying to get them to hit this target, whatever that target might be. And it started trying to get him to hit a building where there's Moose. Sure. And they get a direct hit.

Speaker 4:          02:12:39       Now you say fire for effect. Yeah. That means you need to make any more adjustments. You can just start hammering that thing. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Fire for effect. God. So when somebody does something and it's on target, you like, yeah, fire for it. Oh Dang. Okay. I just want it is one of those ones that you know, I, I'd hear all you in life always say it and you know, how certain do we save that much? No, not that much. But I, that's where I would hear him kind of come out and you know how certain terms, if you're not familiar with them you can kind of gather what it means is, you know, in, in a contact in the conference room in the words and stuff like that. But that one I never could really figure out exactly what that means as opposed to, you know, I don't know fire at will or all these other things that you hear fire for effect far perfect cause it, it kind of sounds like it could mean like to distract them or something to have some effect other than hitting the target and something like that.

Speaker 4:          02:13:30       Yeah, apparently not.

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       Apparently it's the opposite and you know, it's all good. It's just amazing. Can you show him up with these these guys man? Yeah. And, and I'm telling you like, and I've said this before, that thread of, and I actually don't like using the word warrior culture. Yeah. Because, because it's so overused. It's so overused and it, it's just, it's, it's been so degraded by this horrible, meaningless things. That guy's a warrior. You know what I mean? Because he, you know, did what made it a crime and actually survived his prison. Yeah. Well, that guy's real warrior. No, actually you're not, you know, but, but there's no other word that I can put on it. I at least that I could think of right now. When you talk about the American culture, and it's so easy because America's a big place and America's got a lot of good things going for it.

Speaker 1:          02:14:35       You know, the culture of art, of art in America's massive, the culture of music is, is unbelievably powerful here. The culture of education and academia, all these things are massive in America, right? And, and it's really easy to forget the culture. This the most, in my mind, the most powerful culture that we have now. I could be wrong. Oh, what about our [inaudible] entrepreneurial spirit and culture, right? That's huge year. Very strong. Our capitalist culture, we want to make money, we want to grow, we want to do things right. Those were all really, really powerful and I think we tend to forget. We tend to forget. We want to, we want to say that, you know, the Japanese Bushido culture is this thing. We should look up to. Guess what? Guess what? That bushido culture versus the US marines, you know, storming beaches in heavily defended beaches and other guess what the American warrior culture, that's, that's the real deal.

Speaker 1:          02:15:50       That's the real deal. The Nazis. Oh, the storm troopers. Oh yeah. Those were such a warrior culture. Guess what? Compare them to these guys. Know. No, not happening. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. These, and you hear this a lot like that. There was a little part in the book where the guy got his legs blown off or something like that and he was like, I'll be back. I'll be back. He's like, and it, it really seemed like he was, he wasn't pissed about his legs. He was pissed that he's out of the game for you guys down. I'm going, you know? Yeah. I think a lot of times, and you know, America is kind of what an example where you don't want the, all things are going real good. It's easy to point out the things that are not going good, you know, like Whoa, whatever the case may be.

Speaker 1:          02:16:36       Like when, if everything's perfect, the little imperfections show themselves more. You know, how like if your life is like everything's together, where your job is good and your family's good or whatever, but meanwhile, like you're, I don't know, your front line is going down. You're like, my front lawn is going right. You know, it's like that kind of thing. Um, I think that's what we have in the u s it's kind of like things are really good. I think it's more just a matter of percentage. I mean, I think in America right now it's like, oh, 1% of the population is actually in the military. I mean, all of these World War II veterans are not many of them left. Vietnam veterans are getting older. Korean veterans, veterans are very, very rare at this point. So, and what are our movies about? The, you know, instead of making movies about St low, they make movies about the aliens attacking or whatever, you know.

Speaker 1:          02:17:30       So we just, it's pretty easy to forget that the reason we're here and the reason we're not speaking German is when the reason we're not speaking Japanese is because of this warrior culture here, which kind of, it's right up there. It's right up. You show me any warrior culture that has the same that, you know, I know there's equivalents, I know that there's other, I know there's other military units in the world and other countries that have a proud military tradition as well. But you know, obviously I'm biased towards mine. Yeah. But, uh, were you tell me any historical unit that you say, Oh, these guys with the Spartans and they were the real warriors. Right. You know, you haven't really spent much time with a 19 year old marine. You, you haven't spent much time with a, with a, with, with a soldier from an airborne division.

Speaker 1:          02:18:22       You just, you just, you got to meet those guys. Yeah. I'm telling you. They're the real deal. Yeah. And no matter what kind of, you know, historical warrior you want to, you want to throw out there, I'll put my Americans against the head to head it just, it terms of just straight up warrior culture and spirit. I'll go, I'll go toe to tell, I'll go toe to toe for sure. I'm not, I'm not trying to say we're better, but I'll go toe to toe with the Spartans. Yeah. I'll go toe to toe with them. I am just talking, you know, my warrior culture against your warrior culture and the way you lived your life, you go, go meet some of these young soldiers and marines out there. You can come and talk to me and, and special operations guys. You know what I mean? Obviously come and get some, come in fire for effect. Sorry, do it. I just learned the word. I'm trying to hit it in warrior culture doesn't get through all of America.

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       Nonetheless. We are down to support ourselves. I wasn't gonna make some wisecrack about Hawaii, but you know. Yeah, you might, you might get dealt with. No, not going to do that. No, because just a massive, there's a, there's a great book that somebody sent me and it's about Japanese Americans that formed up, you know, we sent American, sent many Japanese to internment camps in America, in World War II. They also took a bunch of them and turned them into a fighting unit. But the four 47 yes. And they were, they might be the most highly decorated unit of their, of that size because B, but a lot of them came from why? Yeah, yeah. It's a huge Japanese community in Hawaii. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah. And speaking of Hawaiian [inaudible] hall, like the and Warrior culture, Hawaii for sure. Yeah. So am I allowed to just straight up say Bj tender right now and my boy Max Holloway, by the way, by the way, car Max came and trained with us.

Speaker 4:          02:20:37       Yeah. I've told this story before, but man, what a board, a beast. He, you know what? He was trained in hard. Yeah. He was trained hard. He wasn't even close to the UFC yet. This was years ago. It wasn't close to the UFC yet. He hit some warrior culture and them, yeah, get some super nice guy too. And when you, when you can sit her like even let's say the sparked in, then you consider all their battles and stuff. This is like hand to hand soared to nec battles. Just like Dang that's, that's savage. But back in those days look at all kinds of cultures. So consider Hawaiian culture. If you look at the weapons like you can look like in museum, just go online, whatever, look at the weapons that they used in battle and then consider like that's what you got to use. It's like savage, like Plu. Yeah there, there are legitimate where your cultures but it is different. There's no doubt. And what I'm saying to, to encapsulate what I'm saying is America has one and it's told her toe with any, I don't slip and sleep on that.

Speaker 4:          02:21:39       So support, support wise. I'm going to shift gears here. So, I mean, you know, I, I'm talking about kettle bells all to, I feel like I'm talking about not just now feel like I talk about kettle bells a lot. It's one of those things, you know how like you go from thing to thing and you're like, Hey I'm going to go to one. You go from thing to thing. You know, I try to acquire knowledge and what do you call it? Skills. Capabilities. We'll say capabilities that's important. Participation is required. Kettlebells is kind of like a thing that I recently got into and I'm going to be honest with you. You can kind of good at them Jack. Cause considerK and here's, I'm going to go into numbers, whatever. So my metcon was, his wit was um, I'll do one 35 can I knew jerk cleaning, press dreck, whatever presses.

Speaker 4:          02:22:35       Like just pressing night jerk is kind of like you jerk your whole body kind of thing. Okay. So it's clean and jerk one 35, you know the wheels, uh, five and then two burpees, five walked for 30 to 35 seconds. Boom. Do it again. So anywhere from, I dunno to about eight sets would be like a solid one. Usually 32nd walk. By the way, it's like, uh, the recovery. It's like, it's like you're breathing. That's why. Okay, so it helps. Wait. Why should I not do that? I'll be going to five, five, five, five you wouldn't, I challenge you right now. We're going to do it together and you just go five five oaks. We can go longer. Well, I don't want to do that. Well, I might die. Contest wouldn't be to go longer. Well, whoever, whoever stops the rhythm. I'm saying that the rest is, it's part Rico here.

Speaker 4:          02:23:28       Here's the goal. That's why. Well, let me ask you this. How long does it take you? Like 30 seconds to do. Does it take 30 seconds to do the five and five? Yeah. No, no, no more. None. No, no more than 30 so you do five clean and press right. Boom. Five burpees. Yeah, it's more than 30 seconds. Maybe 45 at the most, maybe 45 yet. I Dunno. That's a good question. And it's more than 30 though, for sure. Okay. Well then I guess it might be all right. So put that on a timer though. You shouldn't do sand like a minute 30 IBS for 30 to 35 you should be like, okay, I'm doing it all because you're saying like the Tba, well you should do, you should do a minute, 30 seconds every no and every minute and 30 seconds. So you do the five and five.

Speaker 4:          02:24:07       Okay. So that way you get, cause by the, by the six set you'll be like tired when you're starting it, but you don't want to rest more push yourself. This is kind of my thought, my thought process on it is I'm going to do a certain kind of work capacity, you know like you know, five reps of this and five reps of this and then I'm going to have, have a kind of an active recovery period walking. Yeah. And here's the thing and here's kind of the goal. This is good. I actually, I actually am going back on what I said. I think this is actually not a bad idea because, but you need to put, it's like when I do, sometimes I'll do stuff on the minute. What makes me nervous about what you're saying is that I like rest for about 30 and 35 seconds.

Speaker 4:          02:24:45       No, I don't know what that means. Okay, okay. Because, because that could be 40 seconds. That could also be, it's not, you've got a clock on. Yes sir. That's 100% yes. So the, here's the weird thing, but having a clock ever since I started lifting rest between sets has been a critical part of my lifting routine from the beginning. Rest between, because that's just what I learned and stuff like that. So I don't think the clock and actual clock is not been a part of a workout ever. It's part of the way. It's like, wait, there's weight, just like you're lifting those weights. That's what the weights are for. The, you're going to rest in between sets. That's what the clock is for. You can't just go willy nilly and be like, Hey, I'll just throw on whatever, and that's just my philosophy. I'm not on the clock of a one hour workout from me would take like two hours.

Speaker 4:          02:25:34       Yeah. I'll just, I'll just be thinking about something or I'll just take more rest than I should have taken or whatever. Yeah. And consider this, if you're doing, let's say you're doing five sets of squats, I dunno, eight, we'll say you're pushing on your second set, you can do more weight then or less weight then on your first set if you rest for less time there. Right. So if you rest for five minutes, you can do way more. Yeah. So that's putting your body through something different than if you would've just rested less. So it just depends on what you're trying to put your body through while you can recover from. And what kind of results we want to goals on. Or one of the hardest workouts is, and this isn't, this is discipline equals freedom field manual. I used to do the 20 rep squat workout.

Speaker 4:          02:26:20       Sure. Which is you take away that you can do 10 times, you do it 20 times. Oh yeah. Okay. Sorry. And, and it's, it's devastatingly hard. Yeah. And I would rest for 20 minutes and then I would do it again and then I would rest for 20 minutes and then we'll do it again. So three sets of that. That is okay. So tech and I believe you, I'm not saying it's easy, I'm not saying that, but that being said, technically that's impossible. Technically yes, you're right. It is impossible to do something that you only do 10 times, 20 times. If you can do the weight that you intend for him to 20 times, that's the way he can do for 20 days straight. That's not 10 right. So I get, I get it, but I'm not going to, I'm not going to, you're right. But you also understand what I'm talking.

Speaker 4:          02:27:08       I know exactly what you're talking about. You're like a normal, like you're not maxing out at 10 reps with this weight. It's like this is my normal. Maybe if I'm going to do a set of Tanner, she'll be surprised that the way you can get, like let's say you know, you, you pick the right weight that you can like I can do this 10 times. Yeah. Legitimately. And then you're like, you know what, I'm going to do it 20 times. I know, but you're right. But I think that's like a curse of knowledge kind of situation. Like when you say I'm going to do a weight 20 times, what I can say for lack of better during the normally do tan, it's not normal. Also, you're like, you're basically, you're resting as much as a human being can rest with a bunch of weight on their back in between Reps.

Speaker 4:          02:27:52       When you get to rep 12, you're taking like time. But it's, it's, it's a really, it's a losing proposition because while you're waiting there resting, you're actually suffering and your backstory to get old in there. Yeah, yeah. No, yeah. The overhead squats are a brutal because you're not resting in an overhead squat position and it's like awkward and yeah, that, that's hard. The overhead squat situation, but, and not to beat a dead horse here, so like consider if you said, hey, uh, someone who's pretty new, more or less to work it out. Say, Hey, get a weight you can do for 10 and do it 20 they're going to mess up in one way ticket. Probably they're going to be like, okay, I can do this 10 times. I know that and I'm gonna try to do 20 and they can't even get to get 20 because you said the weight that they could do for 10 they try for 20 they feel it 10 that's how much they can do for 10 or they'll go the other way.

Speaker 4:          02:28:39       There'll be like, you were like, oh, get up. And they'll be like, wait, I got to do this 20 times. I, yeah, I can do this. I can do the bar 10 times, so I'll just use the bar kind of thing. So you have that knowledge where you, you're like, Hey, I know the weight that I can do for 10 and it'll be hard, but you know what, I'm going to get nuts. And if I really pushed myself, I can get 20 guess what I'm using. Not Wait. So you kind of have that because you've been training, so I get it. Yeah, you're right. And I don't think I'll ever do that even though I kind of considered it last time you mentioned it, but then when I got in the, in the workout room I was like, yeah, I don't think I'll ever do that.

Speaker 4:          02:29:14       Maybe I will. I don't know. You were actually, I'll tell you what I will do. Is someone online, maybe it was you. Someone was saying a hundred burpees in 10 minutes. 10 minutes. Was that you saying? Yeah. Yeah. And Brent. Brendan just texted me yesterday. Yeah. Brianna branch. Cherry. Yeah. He said he's going to do it. I was considering I'm going to do it in the first time I did it. That's what I saw was surprised at Brandon. Brandon's a good shape to the receipt. He be post like pictures of himself doing these crazy pushup workouts. Yeah. I can't believe he can't do it. That's why I'm so surprised. This is what I'll do is a weird, he has good creative pushup drills. Does creative pushup drills, I don't know. He'd doing this weird stuff. He puts his hands up here. Over there. Yeah. That's good.

Speaker 4:          02:29:54       Yeah. Totally good. Yeah. Cause you ever trade lake. I got good at push ups when I was thinking, actually I'm still pretty solid that pushups. But you tried to do a pushup with like adjusted. You're like, oh this is way off. It's kind of like goes back to what we were saying. It's like what you used to do your neuro muscular. Speaking of what we were saying something about kettlebells, we kind of wrap up right now and then you started talking about other, the other crazy squat. You don't what it is my fault next time I won't tell anything. Yeah. Yeah. See that's what, that's what I see. What you did there. Look, you took blame you and you told me what you're going to do to fix it. Yeah. Dang. Extreme ownership in effect. I'm also, okay, wait, what were we talking about? Oh yeah, I'm into kettlebells. No. Yeah, and you want to say where are you should get your kettle walls. I'm not saying necessarily where you should. I'm seeing where I got them. Okay. And if you want you, you kettlebells anywhere where really? What about cool kettlebells? Ooh, okay. Whoa. That's a different story in my head anyway. I don't mind from on it. I'm not even saying get the cool kettlebells. I'm seeing gold on at.com/jocko

Speaker 4:          02:31:02       Lukey the kettle bells. You liked those kettlebells. If you're going to get into kettlebells or if you're already currently into kettle bells, get some of those if you like them. I like them. I got one. Uh, the small one. It's called a howler little howler monkey.

Speaker 2:          02:31:18       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:31:18       I think it's a, anyway, howler monkey, kettle bell. It's like a, I won't say 18 pounds. What's 0.5? Pooed a bounce and Prudy 16 pounds. Yeah, no, no, no, no. 16 kilos I think. Oh, sorry. 16 kilos. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, so eight kilos, 16 pounds, give or take. 70 18. Anyway, I got one of those for my daughter. So my nephew comes visits. He's 11 not into working out. We'll just say that is now is now. Yeah. So I'm like, you know, he's one of these kids, he's like, you know, he's into math and whatnot. So I'm working out all the time and I'd never really thought until someone may be kind of suggested it to say, hey come work out with me, you know, so I tell them come work out and he, I kind of caught them at the end where it was metcon time and he and I was like, hey come work out.

Speaker 4:          02:32:07       Cause I saw him, you know, and uh, he's like, yeah, he's like cool. Immediately do by the way, you'd be surprised. I'm not surprised. Yeah man. Working out. They're like, man, I want to be like dad. You know, in their, on some, remember you saw somebody that was all yoked. You're lucky. Do you, how do I do? That's the whole reason I work out to be honest with you. Like remember the show American gladiators. Remember that. But it was not from what I was a kid. Yeah. I didn't watch it the way you were apparently. Yeah, I was watching that. I was like, Bro, I want to be an American guy. Cause they were there. It was like, cause there was the mix between these big kind of almost like bullies, not bullies, like a bully people, but they were like, you know when you play the video game you come against the boss who you look at them, you're like, I can't meet this guy.

Speaker 4:          02:32:50       I can't beat them but you and you're a normal character or whatever. And then they ended up winning and that's what American latter years was in real life. And I was like Dang this American gladiators or or or money cause were athletic too. I was like, man, I I, I'd watch it and I do a bunch of pushups. I was in like sixth grade or something like that. Yeah, it's a whole reason. Anyway, I think a lot of kids have that in their mind, especially the boys for sure in one way or another. So I was like, hey come work out with me. And he's like, he was like, okay, let's turn this phone. Yeah, he was on the phone. Not Anymore. Boom out there. Uncle Jake scenario, uncle Jake, 100% I was uncle Jacob that time legit nephew is there. Visit. Actually he was visiting me.

Speaker 4:          02:33:25       I wasn't visiting, but nonetheless he comes, I teach him the form and kids kind of have good form. Well he did cause they're flexible. Yeah, they're flexible. They, they haven't fallen into like improper patterns. Maybe like make adults ever or something maybe. I don't know. That's just a guess. But anyway, so I'm like, you know, just the basic kettlebell swing. I say, this is what you're going to do. Do it. I'll do it. I'll show you how. Give them little little tips or whatever. You know, it wasn't perfect for him at first. You'd adjust and he could do it. Not the kind of all the way up or nothing. Just so basic. I was like, all right. And my daughter happened to be there and just so she knows about burpees, so I was like, okay, what we're going to do is you can do kettle bell swings were five and then you're going to do burpees and they're going to walk for 30 seconds basically matter.

Speaker 4:          02:34:07       Yeah. But he's doing the Kettlebell swings rather than the clean and press. So then you can do burpees. Burpees has just jumped down, do a pushup and then jump up in there. That's a burpee. So he does it. I was like, hmm. Well on the, you know when you transitioned from standing to push up, there's a loop. There's some wiggle room there for air. So I, I tell my daughter, hey, demonstrate, she does. She's four, she can do it pretty good too by the way. So she does it and I'm so of course he can do it. He sees a little girl did. So he does it, makes the adjustment. Boom, he's good to go. He's ready. So I'm being fired out cause mine's about to be super hard like it normally is. And he's like, you could tell he's getting fired up too, you know.

Speaker 4:          02:34:41       So I set the clock and we go and his is kind of easy to be honest with you. Cause the Kettlebell swings compared to the yeah. And Boom, they kid did, did the whole thing and he's all sweating afterwards, you know, and he's the kind of where he doesn't do that kind of stuff, you know? But you could tell he was super fired up and you know what he said next. He said afterwards, he's like, hey, next time you work out, can you let me know straight up. I was like, God Dang. Uncle echoes in the house. In the house. Man in the house. Yeah, so she read a book about that.

Speaker 4:          02:35:11       Yeah. Maybe I will. It will be the best book ever forgets next anyway, kind of what's going on it. They have a lot of good stuff. You ever done the battle ropes before? Yes. You have, but not never have. They were in some random Gmr was at the time I was gonna have, I've seen people doing this. I'm going to do some of them. Yeah. They're like big, big ropes and the, I guess that's a good exercise. I had never done them before, but I was considering that. I saw some on there anyway, was a lot of good stuff on it.com/jocko checkout, all the stuff. Really good stuff. Stuff for everything. Basically everything getting after it. Also good way to support is when you get your copy of about face. Of course that's already on it, on our website, Jocko, podcast.com that's the website. If you didn't know clay, the clay pigeons of St Lo, that's the current book we just went over.

Speaker 4:          02:36:04       That one is on the website as well. It's in the little section menu item on the top of the website, Jocko, podcast.com click books from episodes, boom, the list of books by episode. Click through there and before you tweet me and tell me a good book that I should do on the podcast check and see if I've already done it. Yeah, it was like what? Like 60 bucks or so and a lot of really good books that everyone knows, but if you haven't listened to the podcast and then you're telling me to cover with the old breed by Eugene sledge or uh, whatever, just so a lot of times people telling me to cover books that have already been on there. Yeah. So then I got to go and figure out which podcast it was. So I can tell you to go and listen to podcasts, you know, 10 which is what the old breed by Eugene sledge.

Speaker 4:          02:36:49       There you go. I think. Yeah, something like that. But if hey, hey, go and check that out. Like I said, it's all there by episode and if you want a boat, a reading list for me, that's my reading. That's it. Yeah. There's no other books. If a book is good and I read it, it's been, it's been on the podcast and I'll do you one better cause I have a small reading list that I added to that list. Oh, that's only one book, but I'm just saying he's playing games. Yes. Powell. Michael Lough. Um, you know, that's an easy read. It's kind of like the field manual, a small little version, different subject. But nonetheless, it's not like the field manual duty. I haven't read it, but I know. No, no, probably not. Anyway, um, it, as far as supporting, get your books through their click through, it goes to Amazon.

Speaker 4:          02:37:35       You Shop Amazon like we all do anyway. Right. So when you get these books, like I said, listed by episode, Click through there and if you're doing other shopping, hey, feel free. You know, when you click through there that say small little action, big reaction as far as support those, you know, kind of like, you know, when you thorough sodium metal and water, you know, oh I know. Yeah. No, you know, for, I haven't said it for a long time, so I'm gonna say it now just to remind everybody when you throw sodium metal and water, it explodes. Big. Huge Ellen that in chemistry class, my chemistry teacher's name is mister Bigelow by the way. Quite high school back in the day. Anyway. Also good way to support, subscribe to the podcast on Itunes, stitcher and Google play and other places that they do podcasts and leave a review, leave a review.

Speaker 4:          02:38:25       Here's the, if you feel like, yeah, that's really what it is. Reading the reviews. But yeah, if you feel like leaving one apparently it's like, Ooh boy stuff. I don't know. Yeah, good. Yeah, good, good. And that's great for sure. That's great. Helpful and spreads. What does it do? Spread the word. I think ultimately that's the benefit. So you don't want to see our Jocko podcasts on you know, number whatever where it appears like between one and 10 in the business section. That is good. That's cool. But really the tangible benefit for the message is, is spreading the word people. If they get turned on to it, it improves everybody's life really. Because if you improve your life in all these ways, it improves like your improvement re is a direct effect on my improvement cause I hang around with you. So that's kind of how it, so that's really the benefit.

Speaker 4:          02:39:19       So if you want to help spread the word, yeah, can write a review and if you want to give feedback about the podcast and that's a good place to do it. Yeah, I think that's, and let's face it, when you leave a review, especially the ones that everyone leaves, cause p it's kind of fun. That part is fun and people aren't people people like take time and the reviews, they're not like good podcast. Yeah. Well, actually, sometimes they do say that. Good emphasis on county capital. G. O. O. D. Yeah. That's how fast layers layers in the review for the day. But I'm telling you. But anyway, yeah. Hey look, if you're in the mood, leave a review, you know, as long as you're honest, that's the main thing. And you know, get colorful with it if you want. Those are actually the fun ones. Like I said anyway, Lee Review.

Speaker 4:          02:40:04       Yeah, sure. If you, if you feel like it a subscribe, subscribe to the Youtube. We have youtube. If you didn't know. Everyone knows. I think. Yeah, cause we see it all the time. But in the event of this being the first time, subscribe to it though. Why wouldn't you? Why wouldn't someone subscribe to it if I were a person who all weight, if you're listening to this podcast, it makes sense. Yeah. I don't know how many reasons there would ever be to not, this is why. That's the reason I listen to the podcast audio. I look, I go to youtube and I only watch people playing first person shooter video games. You know how that, I don't know if you know this, but that's the thing, like people will watch other people on youtube videos playing shooter games. Let's say I'm only into that, I'm probably not going to subscribe or actually this one's actually a legitimate one that I can kind of dig and relate to is if my youtube subscribing situation is only two kids stuff only to get stuff because every once in a while I get my phone to my kid.

Speaker 4:          02:41:13       Okay. And they watch like you know they watch like Peppa pig or I dunno something. Well and then when they click on, a lot of times the podcast is just what the podcast is on Youtube. But like the other day you released a deleted scene or wasn't even deleted. There's a prerecording we were just talking. Yeah before. And people seem to think it was pretty funny even I thought it was quite funny. So yeah, cause when you're detached it is really funny. But the thing is if someone wasn't listening, if someone's not on subscribe to Youtube, they would never know that that existed and then you miss it. I initially pretty funny. Yeah. I thought it was funny too, even though it was Kinda kinda harsh. What'd you call me? Getaway sticks or something like that. Anyway. Yeah. See now you're, you just went into the reasons to subscribe.

Speaker 4:          02:42:02       Oh, there's a whole reason. Good. Cause you know the excerpts that we make put out. Just cut tiny segments. Three minutes nowadays, take lead the scene was 16 you know, that's different. But it was pretty funny. Yeah. Uh, but the excerpts, you know, they're just like individual ideas that you talk about. Boom, sharable. All good. That's a good reason to subscribe to Youtube. One of the many. My opinion also, Jocko has a store, it's called Jocko store. Jocko store.com. That's the URL on there. What do we have? Shirts, rash guards, rash guards. I, we started for Jujitsu. But here's the thing. Rash guards are first. Surfing and body boarding and jacking. Steel Jacking. Steel. Yes. Cycling. These are all, that's what really, it's a spandex shirt. There's little things. The term rash guards only applies to surfing. And because you're not worried about getting a rash when you're lifting weights, you're not worried about getting a wreck, I guess.

Speaker 4:          02:43:04       Yeah. I guess in Jujitsu or something like this, yeah, guard you against a rash or or ringworm or whatever. Nasty. Yeah. So nonetheless, I mean the point there is that it's for everything. Just because you're talking about Jujitsu all the time, you know, it's not for everything cause I don't want to interrupt you. You know, get after a rash guard. Well that's, you can speak for yourself because if I saw someone at the club with a get after it, rash guard, I would, I would say good evening to that person. Oh, that's a good point. And I guess I can't be mad at him. No, no, no rash guards when you're out not doing activities. I'm not a supporter of that. Yeah. You know what to be, to be completely honest, I don't know that I would support it. I mean just like, Hey, I'm going out, I'm going to a supermarket, put on my good after it crashed.

Speaker 4:          02:43:58       I guess if you do this, like you never know what's going to happen. Yeah. You might want to be ready. Right. It's true. Yeah. You know, you get some good workouts in a grocery store yourself for long line, straight here in the rash guard, your compression, you're ready to absolutely true. And you know you want to look into that. Go to jungle store.com so the shirts on there, I, you know, I tried to add like a new one every like month or so. I don't know what your goal is. I Dunno if I, I've been wearing Bronson's children tee shirt. Me Do. This is the one, cause that's, that's the, that's the shirt that you made or neutral, the one that you made with my face on it. Whatever. Dang. So I'd always get caught up on the front like ha ha, that's funny. The front and all the layers in the front. But on the back it says good evening. So when you wear that one, that's when people are going to talk to you the most. You know how like you don't worry the one with your face on it every day, there's no reason for you to yeah, it would be weird.

Speaker 4:          02:45:06       Yeah. You need to exactly enough. Nope, look at that. Um, but if you wear that one, it says good evening on the back. So I never really thought of this. I haven't worn it. I don't even have one. But that's the one I'd wear. This one good people will say something, it would look good or be like, cool, you're good. It's backward. You're sure it's backwards. I don't know. Or who's that guy in your church? Whatever. People will will say something to you. The good evening one, they'll talk to you even more, but they'll do it from behind and they'll tell you good evening. Every single time. Interesting. You haven't worn it yet. How do you know this? Cause I know, I know the compulsion. Like I know the feeling. That's my hypothesis anyway. And from what I hear from the field anyway, go on there. If you like something, get something that's a good way to support.

Speaker 4:          02:45:52       There's some hats. Oh really? Released. Coming out within one week about that. Cool. Okay. Alright. There it is. I better have like nine of them lined up at my doorstep because I need some of them hats. You got it bro. I promise. Um, so yeah, some patches on there as well. Anyway, check it out. If you like something, get something. Also psychological warfare, if you didn't know what that is, it's an album with tracks. Jocko tracks is Jocko talking, getting you through various points of weakness in your I've been, I've been really trying to think of a word to say other than journey. I haven't yet. So we're instinct with journey. So when you're on your journey, you channel wake up, wake up earlier, maybe I will do it. You're trying to work out where you're, you're trying to work out every day, every day. No. Even on rest days you're doing it MobilityWOD for sure.

Speaker 4:          02:46:51       Like this. Yeah man. Sometimes you want to turn those, those workout days, interest days. So don't do that. And if you need a little spot with that, you listened to psychological warfare, there's a track for that for any point of weakness. Like I said, get after it. Psychological warfare, Amazon music, iTunes, various other MP3 outlets, Jocko Willink. And now, uh, first, if you haven't heard yet, we are now in the league with origin USA little company and we are now a part of it has been months in the making. We've been going back and forth with my boy Pete Roberts and who actually this is you went up about layers. The reason that we are linked up in the beginning was because of Sarah Armstrong. Sure. Who, who heard me talking about how cool origin was. Yeah. That they make everything in America. And she sent Pete an email and said, hey, I know you run this company and this guy was talking about you.

Speaker 4:          02:47:58       You guys are talking to each other. Guess what? We talked and now we're getting after it. And we joined forces and so we're planning all kinds of things and uh, gear [inaudible], rash guards, planting some supplements. And believe it or not, is the rash guard back in stock? Not yet. We were doing a little, we're doing a lot of building right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, but we got all kinds of things coming basically. You know, basically I want to make everything that I used to get after it. Yeah. I want to make so, so everything and um, and when I say everything is not a long list, I don't use that much stuff to get after it. I use a pretty small list but I want to make it and I want to make it in America. So if you wanna check it out, check out origin main.com cause it's in New England, which are where I'm from. It no big deal. Layers, layers. Indeed. And also if you want to get into it, like now you want to find out really what's going on. There's an origin immersion, Jujitsu camp in Maine. I had realized, I hadn't even explained what is

Speaker 1:          02:49:08       you receipt. Oh see I'm from New England so I know what this is. I know what after camp is you, you may or may not know people in other parts. Of course you may or may not know. A camp in this form is in this situation it's a big lake. And on the lake there's a property and on the property they have a bunch of little cabins, a bunch of them, like multiple cabins. And when you go to a camp you stay in the cabins and then they have a kind of a central area. Well we are renting out the entire camp. I don't know how many cabinets, like dozens and dozens of cabins. Right. All these things on a lake. And then there's a main kind of gathering area. Well guess what we're putting in the make it guess what we're putting into main gathering area.

Speaker 1:          02:49:51       Lynn on the Mat. So we're gonna go, you know, if you want to come, you come up, you come to Maine, it's three hours from Boston.

We're going to be a part of both sessions and so come to that. And what we're going to do is we're going to train Jujitsu, but you can only train Jiu Jitsu so many hours a day. So what else are we gonna do? We're gonna hang out with the cruise cruise big time. We're going to do some kind of, there's a big lake there so you can't surf from the lake, but we'll figure something.

Speaker 1:          02:50:38       Water activity out. Right. And they're making lobster. And I don't like lobster, but I'm going to have steak and you can have lobster and, and uh, yeah.

Anyways, we're having the grand opening of our new origin factory in Farmington, Maine. So big factory, 20,000 square feet, I think it's bigger than 20,000 square feet.

Speaker 1:          02:51:22       Uh, everyone's invited to that calm hangout. You know, I was thinking we'd do like, we'll do like a Q and a or something. We'll hang out. We'll bro, I'm Rick books.

Speaker 1:          02:52:04       So some of them can be like, hey, you know, I'll drill some technique with you. Or Hey, maybe you could go over some foot lock stuff with me or whatever.

Speaker 2:          02:55:28       okay,

Speaker 4:          02:55:29       snapchat. You're on snapchat. I'm on it. I'm, I'm learning from my children. Okay, good. That's the way people communicate. Now the snapchat and I looked one of the pages. Guess what? Wall Street Journal's on there. The economist is on there. It's not, it's not this thing for your teenage 14 year old kid anymore. Well it is, but yeah, well maybe I got out of the basement as well, so maybe, I don't know. There must be something to it. I don't know. I'm talking to rubbish but like I have a snapchat, I don't use it and I haven't like, you know, I think you've got to like confirm your account. I was doing it because my daughter likes to make the faces crazy faces. My youngest daughter likes to do that too. So she did it on my wife's phone all the time, and then she hit me up for it.

Speaker 4:          02:56:13       Like, Hey, let me do, she call it snapchat. So she's like, let me snap chat. She doesn't know what it is. She thinks it's just a face. So I'm like, all right. So I tried to do it. Then somehow I've got to confirm. I was like, Nah. So I didn't. But um, yeah, I guess I'm like one foot in one foot out kind of thing. Well, I'm not really, I haven't posted anything yet. Yeah, I almost did. I'm sure I was like trying to figure it out. Yeah. Yeah. Dang, that's good man. But jade told me, well, this is what Jay told me, which was smart. Yeah, this is what Jay told me, your brother Jade. I said, you know, it's just, I don't really understand it. And he goes, that's why you need to do it. I know.

Speaker 4:          02:56:50       I said to myself, okay, you're right. Don't like, Oh, oh, I'm afraid of something. Why am I afraid of it? Don't understand it. How do you overcome that? Yeah, because apparently it's a good method of communication and men J and not to say jade said so, so it's right. I'm not saying that, but he's real smart with that kind of stuff. Like he knows, he see, he knows the trends so he can like predict shit. Those were stuff like how, you know, how like how it will work and who's going to, he is. In fact, what he does now is AI, artificial intelligence with applications and stuff like that. So he knows that stuff. So it's like when he kind of says he can't help but be like, ah, you're right. You know, even if you don't know, you're like, well consider the source kind of thing. In fact, he got me into cryptocurrency investment, so investment and I'm up 30% that's all I'm going to say about it. So I'm like, alright. Yeah, hate to give him him the credit for that.
