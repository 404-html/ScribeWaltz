Speaker 1:          00:00          Jocko. My boss is incredibly controlling. An Ego maniacal. I like him already. Ego Maniac. I have, I have attempted to use extreme ownership in dealing with the people under me, but my boss has reprimanded me for leading. He has said he gets, he gets to do all the leading because he's the one in charge, quote unquote and, and his job title is higher than mine. I've had that happen to me before. By the way, if I could continue to try to lead, my responsibilities will be taken away. If I stepped back into the shadows, I won't make an impact on the people under me. What should I do? So it's black and white. Yeah, in his mind seems that either step up and lead and get fired or step in the shadows and do nothing and everyone will suffer. It's not, it's not that way, right?

Speaker 1:          00:57          It's not. It's not black and white. And actually start by putting your own ego in check because you're calling someone at ego maniacal, but you're, your ego is being, being touched a little bit here, rubbed the wrong way a little bit because you want to lead. And when you get told don't lead, you got paid to and offends you. Guess what that is? You're here. That's your ego. So what you need to do is maybe you like that you liked the feeling of being in charge. That's cool. I liked the feeling of being charge. Yeah, it feels good to me. It feels normal to me when I'm not in charge. I don't like it. I have to consciously suppress it, which is fine. Sometimes you don't have to do that. Like right in the situation here that this guy's talking about and what you need to suppress is you need to not be so overt with your leadership.

Speaker 1:          01:47          He shouldn't even be able to sense that you're leading, but you should be leading. You gotta be under the radar. You gotta be covert with what you're doing. And by the way, while you're doing that, you're massaging homeboys. Ego, make him feel good about it. Making them feel mad. He is running things. And because, because you can absolutely lead from the shadows if your ego allows it. Because a lot of times when we want, when we lead, we want everyone to know that would lead him. I want everyone to know that I'm in charge. I don't want them to know that. Right. That's really hard when you're leaving from the shadows. A lot of times, not even the people that you're leading recognize overtly that you're leading. Think about that. So the people that are actually following you don't even know that they're following you.

Speaker 1:          02:37          They don't. They don't consciously know it. Maybe if they were to break down and you give, gave him like a, Hey, who do you think is actually giving you instruct legal? Well, I think that might be probably, that seems like it's echo. Okay. Okay. But they don't like consciously think about it. So that's what you need to do. You need to suppress your overt leadership. Not Step on the boss's toes. Massages, massage his ego a little bit because if you do get your response, do you want to help? Right? Well, you want to be helpful. You want to lead these people in a great way. If you don't, if you get your responsibilities taken away or you get fired, then you can't help anyone, anybody. You're not gonna help the team at all. So you have to be smart and you have to play the game to win his confidence and his trust.

Speaker 1:          03:20          So he does let you lead. And what's going to do that when he realizes that you're gonna not gonna step on his toes, that you're going to give him the credit because he wants a credit. He's an EGOMANIAC, right? He's controlling. So that's kind of what you need to do. Now, this is the weird thing and this came up at the muster. People don't want to hear me say that. People don't want to hear me say that. People don't want to hear me say that. If I come up against a boss, the big ego, what you need to do is back down. People don't want to hear me say that. They say they want to hear me. Say if you come up against someone with a big ego, what you do is you blow up to them and you show them that they ain't got nothing on you.

Speaker 1:          04:04          Yeah, don't back down. Don't back down to that guy with a big ego that's weak. It's true. And, and what I said at the muster and I said, I said, listen, cause I could see it, I could see it. People are like, ah yeah, I guess Jocko isn't always as hardcore as I thought he was because he's going to back down to somebody with a big ego and I said, guess what people, this is why you feel that way. If there was a, a machine gun nest on a hill and there was a bad guy in there and he's killing a bunch of people shooting that machine gun and everyone in the room wants to look at Jocko and say, Jockos brave and Jock who's tough and Jack was going to charge that machine gun nest and take that guy out. Well guess what? A machine gun belt fed weapon in an elevated position bunkered in.

Speaker 1:          04:54          I'm not going to take that guy out. I can't. It's a heavily defended position. I can't do that. So what Jocko does is backs down. I hide, I get behind cover so I don't die once I've gotten behind cover so I don't die. I look at Echo when I say echo, stay here. Shoot some rounds at this guy. Occasionally distract him. I'm going to flank him. So that goes gonna keep undercover himself. He's going to playing some rounds up with a machine gun nest. While he's doing that, I'm going to scurry away like a little baby, like little sneaky little squirrel. And I'm going to go around to the flank cause the machine gun is in a bunker, right? So he can't see out the sides. I'm coming up the side, I'm going to get right to the assignment to toss a grenade in there and kill him.

Speaker 1:          05:46          I'm going to take out the ego, but I didn't do it. Go in head on. Yeah. So what happens is people come and go up against this big ego and they want to be the hero and they want be aggressive and they want to the default aggressive Jocko. You say you got a chapter in your book, default aggressive man. I'm going to be default aggressive against that ego. Wrong answer. Yeah, the right answers. Indirect warfare, the right answers, maneuver warfare, the right answers. You flank these people, and by the way, if I do charge that machine gun nest or I do attack that guy's ego, guess what? I die or I get fired and now I'm no good to anybody. So it's people have this, this desire to be the strong hero and you have to fight that. That's your ego. That's my ego charging the machine gun nest.

Speaker 1:          06:34          I'm going to go do this on the man. No, I'm actually not the man. It's a machine. Go Nova position. I'm going to die. You have to be smart. Yeah. Like Glenn attack that you go head on. Don't attack heavily defended positions head on period. Like you sit in training day. You ever watch that movie training day? No. Come on, Ray, you've watched it anyway. He says, the Shit is chess, not checkers. He's not the first person that ever said, but it was dope when he said it. In my opinion. Nonetheless, yes. So default aggressive isn't default aggressive. Hey, it to hit its default. Default aggressive in being effective. Yes. Yes. That is really, you're effective or ineffective, and I see their muster, you know, I listen. Lafe knows what he's talking about it like that.
