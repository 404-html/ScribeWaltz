Speaker 1:          00:00          Jocko, I coach high school football, which should I do with the star athlete who's segregates himself and won't participate in hard drills or it won't participate hard in drills. Yeah. Now this one, I actually thankfully remembered that I said I would do this because when I got this, this is a Twitter question and I responded to this Twitter question in one word. So you know, he says, I got this guy, Star athlete, he won't participate in drills. What should I do with him? I responded in one word bench thought that. So, so of course, you know, then people start saying, well, you know, and I was like, yeah, I know we're on Twitter, right? We're on Twitter. Uh, there's more to it then what's happening? I just answered 798 questions and this was 799 so I'm not going to go into full detail. But then as people were kind of chime in and I was like, okay, I'll, I'll answer this on the podcast so we can go into it a little bit more.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Because yes, your coach, your leader, and obviously I talk about this all the time, leadership is a nuanced thing. It takes balance, it takes maneuvering, it takes chess playing, it takes mental, Jujitsu, it takes all those things, right? So the obvious answer of just like bench, that's my meat head answer. And fundamentally we'll get to it, but, and fundamentally that may be the result, but let's dive into it a little bit. Who's The kid? What's his deal? What's his background? What's his attitude? Where's he coming from? What's his family like life? Or what's his family life like? What is, what's his past performance? What's his record? What year is he in school? I mean there's all kinds of things we need to know, right? So now once we've sort of figured out what he liked now that any one of those things, any one of those variables is going to, is going to change our course of action a little bit.

Speaker 1:          01:58          Because being the leader doesn't mean you get to follow a cookie cutter results or cookie cutter solutions to things, right? You're dealing with human beings and every single human being is different, and every single human being has a little craziness to him that you cannot predict. So we're dealing with a kid. Guess what? A 16 year old boy, that kid is even more unpredictable and even more crazy than most because he's got testosterone flowing through his system. He's chasing girls, he's, he's just going crazy. He's not secure with himself yet. He's got zits on his face. He's, you know, he's got things going on, he's got issues. And so this kid is crazy and we're trying to deal with it now. Most kids can get, you know, they get through that and they're still participating with the team. This gets not, so one of the first things I always say this, you got somebody that's not stepping up into leadership position or they're not wandering.

Speaker 1:          02:43          You put them in charge of it. You know, you say, Hey, echo, I want you to run this drill. I think the way I'm watching you perform on the field, but I think you could really lead this drill. Well, I want you to lead this drill and show these guys what's up, right? Oh, so, so you know what I mean? Like he's got a little fired up face on your look just there. So that might take his attitude. And now instead of me saying, Hey Echo, you've got to do this drill like everyone else. I already know that you don't want to do that. So I'm elevating you a little bit, given your ego, a little push, a little massage, and maybe you feel good about that now. And I say, Hey, you know, you can run this drill faster than anyone else. I want you to lead it.

Speaker 1:          03:18          I want you to show them how to do it. I want you to make our team better. Boom. All of a sudden you're getting a little fired up. So that's, that's one solution type, right? I'm just getting kind of a broad solution types on. Another solution type is is, and this is real easy, real easy, is when you're talking to someone that you want to improve their performance, you don't go to them and say, Hey, uh, you need to get better because you're just right now you're letting the whole team down and you're just, you think you're all good. You think you're so good that you don't need to coach. You don't need to run drills with the team. You need to run drills to the team. Now your attitude is what are you talking about? So instead of saying that I again, I'm going to eagle you up a little bit and be say, Hey

Speaker 1:          04:03          man, I'm going to talk to you. I've got to talk to you because I see so much potential with you with your game. I see your athletic ability and I see the way that the other guys on the team look at you. You might not sense it. They look up to you. You're a leader, whether you want to be a leader or not, and the potential that you have and is as an athlete is not going to come to fruition unless you at least get some of your potential as a leader in line. So the reason I want you to run these drills isn't to make you better. I already know you're good. I already know you're good at the drills. The reason I want you to run these drills, Chi, wants you to be even better. I want you to reach your potential. And by the way you help and run these drills is going to make the team better. And the better the team does, the better you're going to do. The more scouts we're going to here looking at you. So there's that, and obviously I'm gonna explain to him why the drills are important for him and for the team and for am and the team together for the all everyone to reach their potential. So those were, those are good too.

Speaker 1:          05:09          I guess overall, broadly what I'd be doing this whole time is talking to the person, talking to the individual, trying to figure out what his reasons were for not wanting to participate in the drills and then countering those reasons with logical answers and you know, saying, Hey, here's why it's important and explaining it to them and then eventually you're going to get to a point where my coaching, my explaining, my maneuvering, my mental Jujitsu, none of it's worked and he's still telling me I'm not running the drills. I don't need to. Cool. Bench next question. You know what I mean? Well, you played ball. What do you think? Yeah, because I didn't play football. Yeah, no, that's exactly right. I would, I would think, and I'm trying to put myself in the mindset back when I was in high school. Oh, I remember

Speaker 2:          05:58          going into my senior year. So you have a, we had some kind of summer training, so it was really like high school summer training. Edis no, no, no. That was, that was for fall. Okay. Um, and that was like a camp situation, but no summer training, which was like after spring and stuff in it and what they'd call it, they call it technique sessions. And all it was was like, you know, I played in high school was kind of like a slap back, which is a hybrid running back wide receiver type. And um, so the technique sessions were just kind of passing drills and you know, just hand stuff and maybe even some foot work. But it was kind of fun. It was just, you know, the quarterback who was there and the receivers in the writing back then you catch passes, run routes and stuff and you know, for like, I don't know, 45 minutes, hour.
