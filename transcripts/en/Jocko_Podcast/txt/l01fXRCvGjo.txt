Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number one 32 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening.

Speaker 2:          00:00:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:12       The warriors are all dead.

Speaker 2:          00:00:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:16       They lie on the more field.

Speaker 2:          00:00:19       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:00:20       they struggled but shall not enter. They went but shall not return.

Speaker 2:          00:00:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:32       The planes are flat and wide. The way home, as long their swords lie beside them, they're black bows in their hand. Though their limbs were torn, their hearts could not be repressed. They were more than brave. They were inspired with the spirit of woo, steadfast to the end. They could not be daunted. Their bodies were stricken down, but their souls have taken a mortality captains among the ghosts heroes among the dead and that is an excerpt from an ancient Chinese poem written by Q one and there's not many details of his life. He was a patriotic poet that lived around 300 BC and the poem refers to the spirit of woo, which I like cause woo means Marshall as in martial arts, as in things that are related to war and things that are related to fighting. Well that's a Wu means of war. Three is talking about the spirit of war. And of course China has an incredibly rich history of art and culture and fought for thousands of years. Many dynasties that I've carried on that rich culture.

Speaker 1:          00:02:43       But we also of course know that China has a long history of war. The Knowledge About Warren, we've already looked at one of the fundamental books about Warren strategy from Sun Tzu, the art of war. And today we're going to take a look at another important document that comes from China. It's called the 36 stratagems. And this document has been around for a long time and it's actual origin is debated where it came from. There's some people that say Sun Tzu wrote it. Actually, there's a, uh, another military strategist named Zeus Dang. And some people think he wrote it, but the current prevailing view is that it's a compilation of information that was compiled by different people, different authors over the year, over the years. And the actual version that I'm using was compiled by a guy named Peter Taylor. And if you remember, so 36 stratagems, that's what it's called, the 36 stratagems. And if you remember from a recent podcast that we did, stratagem doesn't mean strategy. It doesn't mean that it's a trick. That's what it means. It's a subterfuge, it's a, it's a sneaky maneuver to get what you want. That sort of strategy is now this book is divided up into six sections. The first three are for when you're winning and the second three are for when you're losing. The winning stratagems are advantageous, opportunistic and attacking. And the other like losing type strategies when you're losing our confusion, deception and desperation.

Speaker 1:          00:04:46       And you don't want some of these we've heard before summer, a new take on an old idea or an old take that we think is a new idea in all of them. Reinforce kind of what we know and allow us to think about these things a little bit different way and see them from a different angle. So here we go. The 36 stratagems

Speaker 1:          00:05:10       number one sneak across the ocean in broad day light. And so after they give that, that's the actual, that's the, that's the stratagem right there. And so you've got to give a little explanation around some of them. And Peter Taylor does it in this book. He, he lines them out and I've actually seen there's a, there's another copy of this same book where they all have the sort of general uh, explanation. A lot of them have the same general explanation own almost as if it's part of the same book, but to hit that part. So it says number one sneaker across the ocean in broad day light. What does that mean? What you often, what you see often you do not doubt and what is familiar becomes uninteresting and a perfect cloak for the unusual and unexpected. This strategy means that you can mask your real purpose by using the ruse or a fake target that everyone takes for granted. Tactically, this is known as the open faint in front of everyone. You Point West when your goal is actually in the east. For example, a goalkeeper when facing a penalty shot will often stand to one side or the other, effectively inviting the opposing player to aim towards the open space when in fact the goalkeeper reacts and moves to this exact space, the moment when the shot is taken. Thus saving the goal.

Speaker 2:          00:06:31       No,

Speaker 1:          00:06:32       pretty clear. Next one to besiege way to rescue Zau

Speaker 1:          00:06:40       besiege way to rescues out when the enemy is too strong to be attacked directly than attack something they hold close to them or value dearly. So this is a little bit different than just a flank, right? A flank means I'm going to hit your weak point. This is, I'm going to attack something that you care about. Take the indirect approach and find their Achilles heel. So that is the weak point. But the first, the first explanation is not just the weak point, it's I'm going to attack something that you are, you care about. Thinking about how do, how you do this in a relationship like a well in a business relationship or something and insults. Oh yeah. There you go. All kinds of things. Back to the book of the origin of this proverb is apparently from the Warring States period when the state of way attacked Zau and laid siege to its capital hand, Dom Zau term to key for help.

Speaker 1:          00:07:35       But the key general son been determined. It would be unwise to meet the army of way head on. So instead he attacked their capital on hearing the news, the army of way retreated in haste and the tired troops were then ambushed and defeated. The idea here is to avoid a head on battle with a strong enemy and instead striking his weakness elsewhere so that that part we've heard before. We know that part, but I liked the idea of attacking something that they care about more. I mean that's a classic. That's a classic like classic is, Oh, I can't get to you but I'm going to get to your kids. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll kill your kids. That's always the worst. Right. And you know all your movies that you watched. Yeah, they always do that. What? So that as far as comparing it to a flank flank is like, I mean comparatively speaking, what just, I mean obviously to go to the side of the side, is this somewhere the metal shielded or bunk, right bunker, right number.

Speaker 1:          00:08:37       Yeah. Number three, kill with a borrowed knife attack using the strength of another in a situation where using one's own strength is not favorable trick and ally into attacking him or bribe an official to turn trader in your favor or use the enemy's own strength against him. Borrowing a knife to kill may seem rather to devious, but fundamentally it's making use of others' resources for your own gain and sometimes without your opponent's knowing it. There's some underhanded stuff with this for sure. The idea here is it caused damage to your enemy by letting a third party bricked by getting a third party to do the deed. In fact, it can be said that your enemy's enemy is your front, which we've heard before. Kill with a borrowed knife. That's a good one. The, I keep thinking about when I read these, I think about people interacting with other people and how someone will get someone all spun up like, Oh, can you believe echo did this? You shouldn't say something about that. You're right and like, like do that way number four wait to at leisure while the enemy labors, it is an advantage to choose the time and place for battle in this way. You will know when and where the battle will take place. While your enemy does not encourage your enemy to expend his energy in feudal quests to while you conserve your strength, when he is exhausted and confused, you attack with energy and purpose.

Speaker 1:          00:10:10       What part of Jujitsu did you not understand right there? So he asked me that the other day is it isn't a tactic to let someone get tired and 100% yeah. It's like one of the foundational principles. Yeah. I mean if you look at the early UFC, if you look at hoists, Gracie in the early UFC, that was, I would say he used that term, that tactic a majority of the time. Yeah. That's like what essentially did you through is like when they started it like caleal grief. He was a little guy, whatever, and that's the, yeah, that's what he would say. The whole time you cook up and they call it cooking and look at all, it's part of the deal. No cookie dough. That's good. I like that. I haven't heard that one in a while. Number five, loot a burning house. When a country is beset by internal conflicts or when disease and famine ravages the population or when corruption and crime are rampant, then it will be unable to deal with an outside threat.

Speaker 1:          00:11:07       This then is the best time to attack. These are devious, aren't that when you read them, they're devious. Amen. Marshall with the Marshall Way. Yeah. You know what? I've seen some companies, some businesses that do that right there and they do it well. Yeah. When they're really, when they're really hostile, they sew the seeds of all that, all the chaos, all the ravages and all the famines and all the corruption and crime. When a company's really devious, they sow those seeds with the other company and then they watch them fall part of them. Then they go in and take them down. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:45       Luda burning house means taking personal gain from bad situations that your enemies are facing. While a house is ablaze or during major disturbance, there'll be enough confusion to make it easy and accessible to steal or take advantage of the situation. When your enemy is in a state of confusion and chaos, it prevents the perfect opportunity to wipe them out. Number six, make a sound in the east then strike in the West. In any battle, the element of surprise can provide an overwhelming advantage even when face to face with an enemy. Surprise can still be employed by attacking where he least expects it. The idea here is to get the enemy to focus on his on one location and then attack a weekly defendant spot in boxing. Fainting is a body movement or an incomplete attack used primarily to create a certain reaction from the opponent.

Speaker 1:          00:12:39       The idea is to create an opening or draw the opening into responding or draw the opponent into responding so that you may anticipate and counter with a prepared attack. In order for faints to be successful, they must make the opponent believe that a punch is a real thing coming. So we've talked about that before. You can't, you can't do the weak attempt at a submission as well. With Andy, last night we've been having, we've been having some wars lately and last night he, and it's funny and this is, there's a whole, there's a whole thing going on because psychologically, right, if there's a timer on paying attention to it psychologically and like I know how much time I can survive in certain situations, so I might take a risk that I know, hey, if I end up, I'll take this risk right now there's, there's, there's a minute and 18 seconds left. I'm going to take a risk. The risk is going to take me 18 seconds. If I make it great, if I, if, if the risk pays off great, we're going to be in a good spot. If the risk doesn't pay off, well then I've got, it's going to take him 10 seconds to get. Now I've got 50 seconds. I know how long it's going to take. The set some things at the time it was good to go. You're going to be okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:02       Last night it was close, close, close. I'd play the game of risk. Took a risk. They didn't pay, you know, going off. Yeah we were going, they took the risk, didn't pay off, ended up in a bad situation and, and he was straightening out my arm and, and I got out of the arm lock and he slapped a triangle on me and I'm hard to triangle too cause I'm just like large. Right? He slapped a triangle on me. If you do get the triangle on me, it's going to be pretty deep. Now it's, and I was like, it was literally that was thinking of myself. He's, he doesn't have time to finish this. He does not even like, I don't even have to defend this right now because he doesn't have time to finish it. So he slapped it on there. I didn't even defend. And then I was like, oh no,

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       this thing is tight, tight, and then the bell rang. I laughed because it's not, it happens all the time. Yeah. That timer thing is like, that's a real thing. You can almost physically feel the time, but here's, here's the thing is if there's no timer, if we don't have a clock running, my game is different yet I won't take that risk. I'll super patient. Super. You know, sarge used to joke about it. Sergeant be like, oh, Jocko was going to hang onto your arm and work that arm with not moving for like seven minutes. He's going to say he's hanging out. This is all good with me. I'm over here just, I'm just, I'm just cruising. I got your, I'm not letting go of it. That's not happening. I'm going to sit here. I didn't know that. You have a little bit, you're using some strength.

Speaker 3:          00:15:34       You're using a little bit to just maintain. Yup. I'm going to let that happen. I'm going to let you cook. I'm going to cook me a little bit, but you see, you could cook stuff in five minutes. Right? You know, it's hard to cook something in five minutes. It's true. Well yeah, that is true. Generally speaking, that tie like, you know, it's a different, the difference between, you know how like some roles you'll go against the wall or something, you know, you just, and you go against a wall and then sometimes you're like, hey, we're by the wall in the corner or whatever. So let's go to the middle. Or sometimes you know, depending on who your role with what the tempo, what the mood is. He just no walls fair. All good. So that's what the timer kind of is to, you know, or that's what it feels like.

Speaker 3:          00:16:15       You can almost feel it where it's like, okay, the tenant, when the time goes off, the time is game. This is all part of the game now. But if there's no time, it's kind of like, it doesn't have that. So you kind of have, I have more fun role and with Andy when we do, when we have the timer, because that means every three minutes I'm taking a risk and I'm trying to make something happen. Or, or if he's in a dominant position, which he, you know, he gets him really dominant positions and he's really good at maintaining them and he tries to get it done in that time. Otherwise he'd be cooking me for a longer time, I guess. Which would not be fun. No. So I should say that could be all right. Next section. Stratagems for opportunistic situations, create something from nothing. Make somebody believe there was something when there was in fact nothing or simply put lie.

Speaker 3:          00:17:11       One method of using this strategy, Mr. Creating an illusion of something's existence, when in fact it does not exist. Another is to create an illusion that something does not exist when it in fact us pretty obvious. You know, it's a good thing to think about it. Like even if you're of the attitude that you don't want to lie, it's good to know these stratagems that other people can use them on you. Yeah, fully. And the lie, I mean that seems like a conceptual life. Like, you know, you know the guy who gets fired up and puts the, puts on this huge display isn't that sort of ally, you know, ferocious and crazy. And then it's kind of usually just to cover up something else. Yeah, that's true.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       Or if you get, like, if you're going to spend just a moment in time, Sam Harrison, Jordan Peterson just dropped in here and started having a discussion about what was the line, what was, I'm sure that would just take this whole thing to a different place. Well, I'm sure the first thing they would do is determine what is considered a lie. Conceptually, it's like any, any deception really. Yeah, yeah, that's true. So like look, if me and you are in a, I dunno, MMA fight or something and my ankle is straight up sprained, I'm not going to show it. You know, like my natural inclination is to limp on that thing. But I'm going to go out of my way to just show that I'm not, you know, it's no factor. Is that a lot? Yeah. Yeah, it is right here. Yeah. I'm in fact injured. I met there.

Speaker 1:          00:18:41       I bet we're going to get people that are like, no, I lie is technically no. There's probably some technical definition that's puts it beyond just a deception. Yeah. That's my guess. Intentional deception. It's weird cause here's the deal. We know what Elias. Yeah, we know what Elias, we know what it is. We know what is the line? What is it? I Dunno man. There's that gray area. I'm telling you there's that gray area. Check small, but yeah. All right. We will not have a discussion about that next. Openly repair the gallery roads but sneak through the passage of Chin gang deceive the enemy. We've been obvious approach that we'll take a very long time while surprising and by taking a shortcut and sneaking upon him the clock. Just classic fundamental strategy. Next, I like this one. Watch the fires burning across the river.

Speaker 1:          00:19:40       Delay the delay entering the field of battle until all the players have become exhausted, fighting amongst themselves at that point. Go in at full strength and pick up the pieces. When was, this is exactly remember that the person that just asked on the last podcast about how to stop getting interrupted. This is what we're talking about dude, that right there and let other people like to have their conversation and fire their ammunition and then when they're done fighting amongst themselves and they're exhausted going at full strength and pick up the pieces. When a serious conflict breaks out within the enemy alliance, all you have to do is be patient and wait quietly for the chaos to build up because of once this internal conflict intensifies than self destruction will be the outcome besides the patient, besides being patient, make preparations for any advantage that might come out of the chaos. So sometimes you just got to sit across the river and watch the fires burn for a little while. And it's interesting because that's exactly what that is cause you're compelled to interrupt back then all this stuff. But it's good to sit back and remember that the fires burn light, the fires burn number 10

Speaker 2:          00:20:53       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:20:54       hide a knife behind a smile charm and ingratiate yourself with your enemy. And then when you have gained his trust to move against him and secrets sons, who's it most often quoted advice, was to keep your friends close and your enemies closer. But here the stratagem is far more duplicitous.

Speaker 2:          00:21:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:20       In that it advises that the sole purpose of keeping your enemy close is not just to understand them and be prepared for any aggression from them, but is to deceive them with a treasonable act that would see their downfall, hide behind a knife for the smart. So I was having a conversation with a guy the other day and the question is, if you've run something up the chain of command to the absolute top, you can't bring it up anymore. And actually this was a person in the fire services. If you've brought something so far, departments, if you brought something up the chain of command to the absolute top and you still haven't gotten what you wanted, what would you do? Then they were asking me and I was like, well, there's some a lot of things you could do that in that situation, you know you've got less because the, the, the topic was basically if training should be harder, right?

Speaker 1:          00:22:15       If people aren't training harder and I'm bringing it up the chain of command and people say, no, it's fine. No, it's fine. No, it's fine, and you believe that the strong, that people should be training hard so we're more prepared to do our job. What would you do? Then Jocko, and I was like, well, you know, you, while you cook, you know what you could do. You could say, okay, you know what you don't want. Listen to me. Fine. I'm going public. I'm going to write an article in the newspaper about how our department is not prepared to handle emergencies. That's what I'm going to do. Okay? And then they're going to listen.

Speaker 2:          00:22:48       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:22:48       now let's think about that. Let's think about that outcome, right? The outcome is there's a decent chance you get fired. You definitely aren't getting promoted, you. And so whether you get fired or you don't get promoted, you get stuck in this position where you have no influence on. By the way, did you get any check training change, know now could there, is there a possibility that the public takes note and goes, Oh wow, this is wrong and we're going to, we're going to have another election and we're going to replace this fire chief or whatever. Is there a chance that could happen? There's a chance, how'd that fire chief end up in that position? He's a political guy. He knows how to make things happen. He knows how to take care of himself. And if you think he's gonna let some little article out in the newspaper, get him deposed from his position, you're wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:23:33       You're under Matt estimating your, your enemy at this point. Yeah, so don't do that. So I said, what if instead of doing that, you wrote let's say same idea you a positive article about the fire department and it made everyone look good and the chief looked at you like you were spreading the good word. And he says, oh, well, you know what? I appreciate you putting up that article. That was really good. It made us look good. He mastered that part music. I liked your article. Well, you know, chief, I just want to let people know what we're doing over here and now you're building trust. You're building trust with him and now he says, Oh, you know what? Yeah, you, you know what? You should run this thing over here. Once you run that little thing and you take that thing and you run it and you keep it in the box that you know he would like it in and then he goes, hey, you know you did a good job with that.

Speaker 1:          00:24:14       I'm going to get you up a little bit higher. And eventually you get to a position of influence where you actually can make the change that you want to make. Now again, the thing is when I say things like this, people are always, they don't want to hear it. Like when, when when someone, they think they know me and they're like, oh, you know what? And I was saying this the other day at a different company that everybody wants me to say, you know what you're going to do when a situation like that, you come in with a battle ax and you start swinging and you take out everyone that's in your way. That's how you win, and I wished that that was true, but it's actually not true. It's not true. You don't win. You don't win when you do that. Yeah. You have to think. You have to play the game.

Speaker 1:          00:24:58       What you have to do is hide a knife. Gone to smile. Now that's, that's very true. Treasonous. He calls it, but if your goal, if your goal, let's take the fire department. If your goal is to actually do a better job and save more people's lives because you've trained more and that's the knife that you're trying to get out in the end. Is that a bad thing? No, it's actually a good thing. You're not hiding the knife behind a smile. You're hiding. Save lives behind a smile. That's what you're doing. This takes tactical patients. Yeah. Tactical patients. That's a word people used to throw around because they thought it sounded cool. It does. It does. It's a real thing though. And if you don't have tactical patience to play the, to win the long war, it's a long war. Years. They can take years. This situation that they're talking to, this fire guy the other day, that situation could take years to unfold years, but, and we've talked with, if you just make a stink and cause problems and run up the run your mouth and cause all this, all this focus and bring the spotlight to the bad areas, guess what?

Speaker 1:          00:26:06       You're not even going to get, you're not going to get moved up into putting in a better position. Yeah. So don't do that. Yeah. So crazy. That's like a lot of times the advice you'd give is literally the exact opposite of what it feels like we should do. And it's like you feel like, Hey, I need to do this. I just need to know how can you tell me how? And you don't tell how you say, hey wait, you need to do this. No, you don't need to do that. You need to do the exact opposite of that. You're like, aw man, it's not what you think you me up. But um, I will say through experience that your answers tend to be right 100% the time. Yeah. People a lot of times you don't hear anyone. When I was younger I didn't want to hear them either.

Speaker 1:          00:26:47       Yes, that part is true. Yeah, for sure. When when I was younger I was like screw that guy. Yeah. What am I do cultivate a relationship with this, this guy? Yeah. He's, we know on sat, you know there's a, there's a military term onset tried. I used to, that used to be my staff used to be. That used to be as bad as that was the worst adjective I could use. I'd be like, that guy's unsat or you know, whatever it was to gear people like well how's that gear unsat cause you'd get marked like on an inspection UNSAT, which meant on satisfactory. I need to bring that back man. It's been awhile. But yeah, Jeremy Cake not too used to always say that sat on set cause you could have sense to that was if you were to say to me like, oh how was that dinner last night?

Speaker 1:          00:27:33       Sat meaning it was, it was, it was good. It was fine. I said that they knew was that sat unset. You have to put sat and on onset kind of together for sat to make any sense whatsoever. Naturally check. All right, number 11 preserve the plum tree or sorry, sacrifice the plum tree to preserve the peach tree. There are circumstances in which you must sacrifice shirt, short term objectives in order to gain the desired longterm goal. This is the scapegoat stratagem whereby someone else suffers the consequences and the so the rest do not pretty, pretty straightforward. That one. I think some of these strategies that are straightforward, what's good about hearing them is that you recognize them because it might seem obvious, but then you, when you're doing it, you do it. You're like, well I don't know. We could and you say, oh wait, you know what we're actually doing?

Speaker 1:          00:28:27       We're, we're, we're sacrificing the plum tree to spare the peach tree. That's what we're gonna do right now. Once you commit to that or you understand it fully, then you can execute it with more authority. Yes. Was she in the in the wild too? Cause like if you have that, that framework to stick to, you know like, oh this is what we're going to do kind of thing and all these other variables happen on equity, you know, unplanned stuff. But you have that to stick to it. It makes it way more clear to the commander's intent. The commander's intent is very clear and so on. And we know what we're going to do. That's what's going to happen. Number 12

Speaker 2:          00:28:57       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:57       Take the opportunity to pill for a goat, a while carrying out your plans. You need to be flexible enough to take advantage of any opportunity that presents itself however small and avail yourself of any profit, however slight. That's a good one. I think it's, I think it's important to keep in mind though, that you don't want to get pulled off track, right? You want to keep focused on your mission and all of a sudden you can be running around gathering up goats while your real target escapes. So let's not get too crazy with that one. But again, let's keep it in mind. Next section. Strategy for attacking situations.

Speaker 2:          00:29:41       Number 13

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       stomp the grass to scare the snake. Do something unnamed but spectacular to provoke a response of the enemy there by giving away his plans or position or just taunt him. Do something unusual, strange and unexpected as this will arouse the enemy suspicion and disrupt us thinking. This is recon by fire. Just fire some rounds and maybe the enemy shoots back or you're not, and now you know where they are. Next, borrow a corpse to resurrect the soul.

Speaker 1:          00:30:17       Take an institution, a method or even an ideology that has been forgotten or discarded and appropriate it for your own purpose. Revive something from the past by giving it a new purpose or bring to life old ideas, customs or traditions and reinterpret them for your to fit your purposes. Here's, here's an example is like Hitler, he brought back, he would bring back like old viking symbols and route that route. The Viking tradition like, hey, you're a viking where vikings and they have like little symbols. That's, that's exactly what it is and just use that so then people have a deeper connection with with this thing. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:31:13       makes sense. Next 15 entice the tiger to leave it's mountain layer. Never directly attack an opponent who's advantages derived from its position. Instead, Laura him away from his position, thus separating him from his source of strength. The strategy is based on the idea that the tigers powerful only when it's in its natural environment, but if removed from that environment becomes weaker and more vulnerable. I don't know if a tiger is weak, a not a good environment. I think a tiger could still kill me pretty quickly. Even in a city street, maybe in the water he couldn't. No, that's not true. No personnel in Sri Lanka. The Tigers would swim like they would swim and pull fish, get into boats and pull fishermen to their death. Yeah. How's that for a nightmare and that's rough. That's again, pretty clear. You know what? This isn't Jujitsu. You get someone to play that, not their game.

Speaker 1:          00:32:13       Yeah. Oh, you got a good guard. Cool. On the pole. Garland room, or really well, why did you do to founded yet again? It's you take a guy who's, you know, what's the traditional method of fighting? I'm a standup. Throw punches and kicks. Adam. Yeah, so Jujitsu, it's like, oh, you take them out of the punching and kicking situation to the ground. No punches, no kicks and effective boom. That's as you who shits. Yup. You're not in your special place anymore. This is, this is an interesting one. Number 16 in order to capture one minute, let one must let loose cornered. Pray will often mount a final desperate attack to prevent this. You let the enemy believe he still has a chance for freedom, his will to fight thus dampened by his desire to escape. When in the end the freedom is proven, a false owed and the enemy's morale will be defeated.

Speaker 1:          00:33:04       You surrender without a fight. So we've, we've heard that one. That's the golden bridge. We just heard it from Frederick the great, I think we also heard it from the Getty's. They're saying, give the people a little out. They see that. They see that chance to escape. I remember, I think it was for Getty, it's was saying did they would just leave their weapons because they want to get away so bad. They just leave their weapons and, and then you're just waiting for him. Slaughter. If an enemy has no way to retreat than desperation will increase their bravery and ferocity of their fight. So you always offer them room for retreat and in such a retreat there, their morale will be low. Next, tossing out a brick to get a jade gem bait someone by making him believe he gained something or just make them react to it and obtain something valuable from him in return.

Speaker 1:          00:33:57       Pretty straight forward. The real meaning is to attempt this to tempt through the offering of something useless in order to gain something valuable. It is a tactic that utilizes baiting the enemy. The point of this tack is to throw out bait that does not seem like bait on the other hand is important to have a keen sense of judgment to ensure you do not take the enemy's bait in return. The ability to look past the immediate gain and see the longterm cost is a valuable skill. So if you're in a leadership situation, sometimes you hold the line, you appear to hold the line on something, and then you, then you let you let it go. Right. You know, like like, do you want to do something a certain way? And I'm like, well [inaudible] I don't, and it's something I don't care about. Yeah. I hold the line. I was going to give you a nice victory at the end of it. I didn't already know that, but yeah, yeah. You feel like, oh yeah, I see. I was right. You're happy. I made it happen. Yeah. Make it happen. I was able to convince [inaudible] to do. I didn't care. I'm not going to tell you that. I was like, no, you know what? That seems like a good design for that t shirt that go with it.

Speaker 1:          00:35:07       Next, defeat the enemy by capturing their chief. If the enemy's army is strong but it's but is allied to the commander only by money, superstition or threats, then take aim at the leader. The commander falls, the rest of the army will disperse or come over to your side. If however they are allied to the leader through loyalty than beware the army can continue to fight on after his death out of vengeance.

Speaker 2:          00:35:37       That one's straight

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       forward, but that is something that's very important to recognize is is what kind of loyalty the people that you're going against. What kind of loyalty do they have? I work with businesses all the time. There's businesses that established a massively loyal employee base and the people are their way. They are loyal. They're not there for the money. The money is like part of it, but they're there because they want to be there. Those companies and somebody, somebody comes in and starts trying to mess with those companies. Blood bath, it is a blood bath. Okay. Now that's the, now we're getting into stratagems when you are losing, so things change a little bit. Now we're on the losing side. Number one is stratagem tragic for confused situations. This is a good one. Remove the firewood from under the pot if something must be destroyed, destroyed the source.

Speaker 1:          00:36:33       The strength of the fire determines whether the water will boil and the strength of the fire comes from the burning wood. It may not be wise to confront the boiling water directly, but by taking the wood from under cooking pot, the boiling water will soon be cool. In other words, do not confront your opponents strong points, but instead remove the source of his strength. Yeah, that's, I don't know that I necessarily agree with the last part there that not attacking the strong points. I think it's huge. I would say watch out for the volatile points and you, you don't attack the things that can do you damage like boiling water, you attack something that's a little bit detached and you go after the source. I think what he's talking about is like they call it, it's a problem solving method. If I'm not mistaken. This to this direct in the systemic, oh yeah, for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:37:20       Yes you are correct. Yes. Yeah. Attacked at the source. Right. You know of these problems. It's like you know the plant at home, right? You got a tree growing in the yard. The leaves are turning Brown. That's upon us not even fall. The leaves turning Brown. You know what? Paint those leaves green. That's the worst. Yeah, exactly. That's attacking the boy and that's a direct, yeah, that's a direct problem solving approach or or I always say water. The leaves don't want her to leave. You don't want it to leave your water, the roots and then over time. That's a systemic approach. That's the one. Yeah. Kind. You roll deep. Sure. Next Dis. Number 20 disturb the water and catch a fish. Create confusion and use this confusion to further your own goals. Originally it means to stir the water, the sediments in order to cloud the Ver the vision of the fish and therefore catch the fish here.

Speaker 1:          00:38:19       It means to create confusion so that the enemy does not know what is real and what is not. A confused enemy is more vulnerable to any attack. I was, I was rolling with Taylor the other day. Sure. And we were doing, we were standing up, you know when we are getting after it and tailors flows you that don't know. Taylor is a beast. He's and he's like barely human. He's a beast and he wrestled and he does Jujitsu and he's just sick grappler and fighter by the way. No one will fight him, which really makes me mad. He's like he will fight anyone and no one will fight him. He just keeps destroying people. No one wants to fight him cause you get nothing out of it. Cause he's not, he doesn't, his record is new. I think he's three and oh right now. So you wouldn't, if you beat a three no fighter, that means nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:39:01       If you lose two or three in o fighter you that that's not good for you. No one smart is going to take a fight with him. I'm probably not helping by saying this right now. Yeah, not anybody that's hearing this is like, okay well that's one person I'm not going to fight. My point in this was we were, we were doing take downs or we had gotten to a point where we're doing take downs and he must've thrown 87 fakes it me in like three seconds where I was, I had no idea what was happening cause I puff.

Speaker 1:          00:39:34       So he definitely disturbed the water, caught the fish that used to happen with Sarge Sarge, who's an awesome restaurant and Jujitsu and if, if he hadn't been doing much wrestling he would, he would, I could read that he's going to come because he's just got a sick blast. Double like sergeants, blast doubles, just sick and, and he just comes in full power and it's just hard to stop. But if he hasn't been wrestling, he really, he knows he can just, he just goes into like, okay, I'm gonna hit up last double. Like I'm tired of playing around and stuff. And so he gets that look on his face and I could read it, cause I know him for 25 years and he'd get the blast, double look on his face.

Speaker 1:          00:40:18       I remember one time, you know, I must've sprawled on him like two or three times in a day. And, and it was, it was kind of, I could see he was a little bit surprised that he wasn't dead. He didn't take me down. And I was like, yeah. So I told him, I said, hey, you know, when you haven't wrestled for awhile, you don't set it up, you just do it. And then we wrestled again and he'd set up again, just 47 little touches my face to pull my arbitrary, donate to this here pushed me there, drag this good slap here, boom. And all of a sudden here comes the blast off of which I didn't know was coming. That makes a big difference. Yeah. Get them waters blurred up. Yup. Alright.

Speaker 2:          00:41:02       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:41:04       Sluff off the CICADAS. Golden Shell.

Speaker 1:          00:41:11       Cicadas like a cricket or like a grasshopper. Mm. This stratagem is mainly used to escape from an enemy of superior force. Mask yourself by either leaving you're flamboyant traits behind, thus going incognito or just masquerade yourself and create an illusion to fit your goals of distract others. So the grasshoppers, crickets at some point in their, what's it called, the lifecycle, like spam lifecycle. Sure. Yeah. They, they basically, their skin, whatever it is, they're shell. Yeah. They have to, they get rid of it. They molt. Yeah. They get rid of it. Yeah. Well you can do that too. Yeah. You can leave some stuff behind them if people think that's still going on, but really you're escaping. Yeah. When a cricket has grown to a certain stage, it's sheds its outer shell and leaves the empty shell behind this empty shell is often mistaken for our wheel cricket.

Speaker 1:          00:42:05       Yeah. It's kind of like on total recall, remember total recall the movie Arnold Schwarzenegger? I don't remember what, I don't fully remember it. Yeah. So, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. He comes in as that woman? Yeah. Well, yes. Okay. Oh yeah, there's that part too. Yeah, they the lady. Yeah, two weeks. Right. Then it malfunctions, throws the head and it's an explosion. I was thinking more like the Hologram. They always, they had this hologram thing where it's like, oh, you know, it's him, but it's just the Hologram. Meanwhile, he's, I think escaping for something like this. I went and saw when I was in college, I had to go see a Shakespeare play, which was cool. I'm down with that. I would bring my Shakespeare book to the place. I had my notes when I was there and it was funny because after the play was over, they went, they like brought out the cast and was, you know, kind of introducing them with some details about their career and the woman that played that woman, that head came apart and Arnold Schwarzenegger was inside her.

Speaker 1:          00:43:07       She was in the Shakespeare play and here she was just getting off stage from crushing some Shakespeare and I think it was Richard the third and the highlight that they pointed out of her whole career. It was that she was like the woman in the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie whose head came apart and total recall. That was actually, and then then it was in, in the pamphlet that they give you when you go to the play. It was telling this guy did this and this guy was, it has been in this and this guy was in the royal listen, you know, and then it's got her and it says she played the woman in total recall. Yeah, but here's the thing about that, like on paper, literally on paper that doesn't, that sounds like, oh, this little thing, but bro, that was a huge part of the movie. Let's face it, two weeks, how long are you going to be on Mars? Two weeks. And it's like, whatever. Do you have any vegetables or something like that. And then she goes two weeks. Oh Dang. Thing starts malfunctioning. Boom, boom. They identify them. Emmett's big part of the movie. Bigger than Shakespeare. Arguably. Yeah, no.

Speaker 1:          00:44:16       All right. This is one is a little bit of a contradiction. Listen to this one. Number 20 to shut the door to catch the thief, to capture the enemy. You must plan prudently if you want to succeed, do not rush into action before you move in for the kill first caught off your enemy's escape routes and caught off any routes through which outside help can reach them. So that is the opposite of having a golden bridge, having an escape route that your people can get out of. So you've got to, if you've got a note, does that mean now they're both in valid? No, actually to me it means they're both valid. But you need to recognize, because for instance, let's say you're in a situation where you surround the enemy and all of a sudden they start fighting really hard cause you're like, Hey, I'm going to fall 22 I'm going to, I'm going to surround, everyone are going to keep them locked in there.

Speaker 1:          00:45:01       You do that and they start fighting really hard and you're losing a lot of guys that you know, hey, open up a little spot for him to escape. Yeah. And let him run away and we'll be waiting for him over here. Yeah. So just because things are opposites do not, does not mean they negate each other. Yeah. It's one of those deals where, you know, it's circumstantial, right? Like in Jujitsu it's like, Oh yeah, does this scenario, you know, going against this guy, does this, uh, should I use strength and power and should I hustle a lot? We'll that strategy work with this guy or is it like, okay, I should play more passive or something like that. No, that's true. And actually to get even more tactical and Jujitsu, you could, you could, let's say you mount someone and they started just getting crazy cause they don't want to take a good getting completely nuts and you're trying to choke him, try to choke because you've got every day and they're getting nuts and you can't do it if you open a little spot for them where they think they can sneak out.

Speaker 1:          00:45:59       But you're waiting for him there with the arm lock. Yeah. Yeah. Get the W. Yeah, actually, yeah. That is really how it kind of works. Where, yeah, when you get mountain you want to hold position. I mean as far as traditional to do through, for lack of better term, you get mount, you want to hold the position right? Don't want to lose position. You can get flipped over, but if you can hold them out, good. But if he's big, strong, the starts, you know that last desperation attempt, boom, you got to kind of let them hopefully turns over. Really, that's usually what they do. If they don't have the experience and then boom, you, you, so you essentially give up the mountain, but, but you get it. Even he was like, if you talk about a big strong guy, that's your more experienced, even just you could prevent them from pushing you up in a way, right?

Speaker 1:          00:46:43       You could block that door down when there's no escape or you could let them do it a little bit. You can have that little thing and then boom. Yeah, arm locked. Just whatever's better for the peds situation. Sure. Next, befriend a distant state while attacking a neighbor. It is known that nations that border each other become enemies while nation separated by distance. Next number 23 be friend, a distant state. While attacking a neighbor, it is known that nations that border each other become enemies. While nation separated by distance and obstacles make better allies. When you are the strongest in one field, your greatest threat is from the second strongest in your field, not the strongest from another field. That's a, that's a good thing to think about. Hmm. That's a good thing to think about. When you were the strongest in one field, your greatest threat threat is from the straw second strongest in your field. That makes sense. See that business all the time, right? The, the, the, the company that makes pizzas isn't worried about the company that makes cars. Yeah, that's true. Right? They're more about the other companies that make pizzas. Nope. Next 24

Speaker 2:          00:48:04       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:04       Obtain safe passage to conquer the state of Gill.

Speaker 1:          00:48:11       Gail is a state. Borrow the resources of an ally to attack a common enemy. Once the enemy is defeated, use those resources to turn on the allied that lent you them in the first place. That's under handed situation right there. It's underhanded situation right there, isn't it? Yeah, it's bad. Yeah. Careful with that one. But you can see it now. It's something you gotta watch out for. Well, if that's your enemy to begin with, I'm assuming, yeah, that fits your enemies to begin with, but if how much of your enemy is going to help you, they help you and then you just turn this down the track. Got To be careful of that. I think that's the definition of backstabbing. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:48:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:58       Yeah, that might be the day. That is the actual definition. All right. Next one. Stratagems for deception situations.

Speaker 1:          00:49:09       Number 25 replaced the beams with rotten timbers. Disrupt the enemies formations, interfere with their methods of operations, changed the rules which they are used to following and go contrary to their standard training. That's all really good stuff. In this way, you remove the supporting pillar, the common link that makes a group of men and effective fighting force. This goes back to what you just said. I mean, it's clearly go away from what they're used to, right? That's what we do. That's what Jujitsu was supposed to be. Everyone's going to, like you said, they're going to stand and try and punch you. We're not going to do that. We want to take them down to the ground. Next 26 point at the mulberry tree while cursing the locust tree to discipline, control or warn others who status, position or status or position excludes them from direct conversation or confrontation.

Speaker 1:          00:50:06       Use analogy and Innuendo. When names are not used directly, those accused cannot retaliate without revealing their complicity. Oh, well that's sneaky. You know, that's like when you're in the meeting and there's the person up the chain of command they haven't been showing up on and you start saying, you know, we got people, you'll bill hasn't been on time and you're really talking about them. I have to use this sometimes have to use it sometime because we will work with companies and the company, let's say, let's say the CEO brings us into the company. Sometimes we figured out that the CEO is the one that's the root of the problem and one of the reasons that they're, the root of the problem is because they don't think they need to change anything. And so they bring us in to change everyone else. Guess who needs change?

Speaker 1:          00:51:00       The big man, the big man, the reason that they don't want to change is because they got the ego that prevents them from listening. So to go in and directly confront them on what they need to change is not going to be effective. So to go in and give, I've given, I've given a whole presentation, I did this one time where I gave a whole presentation and maybe I've done it more times, but there's one time that I specifically remember, I gave a whole presentation to, you know, the 15 people, the senior executive leadership of a company. The entire presentation was directed at one person, the CEO, and I was going, it was about ego. It was about, you know, keeping that in check and how you don't know everything and how you got to let your listen to your subordinates and all those things.

Speaker 1:          00:51:46       He wasn't doing any of those things. So isn't there like a basic tactic that I think people do all the time instead of, you know, like I'm the boss and I'm holding the company meeting and whatever. And, and you know, let's say there's one guy who always shows up late to work, I dunno. And in the meeting he'll be like, hey guys, we've, we've got to show up on time. It's very important, but just the very use of the word wheat rather than pointing at one guy, you know, we got to show up at the time we got to do this. It's kind of like the person who is who he's talking about, Kinda like he feels it. Yeah. That's a good way to start. There's some people that even when they're not part of that we, and so sometimes you have to escalate that to you.

Speaker 1:          00:52:28       Yeah. But that defeats the purpose of that. And it's defeated. You can, if you, if the strategy doesn't work, you might have to escalate into something a little bit more direct, you know, break out the battleax. Yeah. That's always the last option is just to make sure everyone wants to break out the battle ax. That's what everybody wants to do next. 27 feign madness. But keep your balance, hide behind the mask of a fool, a drunk or a madman, to create confusion about your intentions and motivations. Lor Your opponent into under estimating your ability until overcompensate overconfident. He drops his guard, then you may attack. Yeah, that like the movie white men can't jump. You ever see that? So he did it woody. Oh, and he made it like he couldn't play ball. Like he was just this Dork Geek, what do you call a chump, whatever. That's what they'd call him chump. Like he's Super Dorky. He goes and everyone else is just so cool and boom,

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       flashy and all this stuff. He comes in, he's a super nerdy and you know, boom. Of course they pay a cam, you know, kind of thing. And then he beats him. Would he beat them with flashiness or would he beat them with, with traditional, let's call it just who's your style? Hardworking. Yeah. Well no, he had legitimate skill. He was like this. So yeah, he'd come in, he'd be Super Dorky. And then, um, at first he tricked them. So he came in the introduction to him. He was like the acting all Dorky. And then the guys, the Wesley snipes in them, they're all playing basketball and they're, you know, get into little arguments or whatever won't guy gets hurt or is Bunyan on it or something. And they're like, hey, we need another guy. And then the guy who's like, you know, let's, you know, get him or whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:54:13       So they're like, Hahaha. You know? Yeah, you got him. Whatever they play, he ends up to be pretty good, doesn't show a lot, but he's like pretty solid. And then they're like, hey, you guys lucked out. You had this Dorky guy, you guys kind of lucked out. And he's like, Oh yeah, you know, maybe you did look up, or maybe I'm just better than you, but they're already convinced he's the stork you got in there and I cough. I'm better than you. He was like, all right, well, it's been kind of thing. They're already convinced. Bull Shark consist scenario. Yeah, yeah, exactly right. Same exact thing. Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty obvious one. And I think, I think one thing that, again to take away from this is if you know these things, you're less likely to be suckered in by them. Yeah, that's, that's the most important thing.

Speaker 3:          00:54:57       Yeah. That you see the pool shark thing, I saw a guy who really clumsily tried to do that. He'd worked in night club, we had a pool table in there and this guy came in and he like acts like he's like, he comes in and just a normal guy, he comes in with his own key. Oh by the way, his own pool stick, which is an indicator. Yeah. Like total giveaway. And he didn't, comes in and then immediately when like he kind of enters the little scene, you know, the little area where the pool, he acts like he's just kind of drunk and just real oblivious, you know, he just total just switches to a different guy. And here's the thing, we, you can't let drunk people walking around in the bar. So you know, when waitresses or other, or the manager would come by and they'd be like, Hey, is that guy that guy's to junk?

Speaker 3:          00:55:44       Like, why are you kind of like keep an eye on him? And I'm like [inaudible], he's not drunk. He's like acting drunk. So I go talk to them just to sort of make sure. And he was just like all normal talking to me. I'm like, no man. But yeah, he tried no one. I mean it wasn't like no one to get my phone. He wouldn't get money from anyone. Well, here's the thing. No, because it was like a nightclub. It wasn't a competitive pool hall. No one cares. No one's going to take is, no one's even gonna bet. They're like, Bro, we're just cruising. I'm like, why are you, you know, wanting to bet kind of. I'm not saying that happened, but I'm saying that's the, I guess in this day and age you'd have to be pretty dumb to fall for this. Anyone who will haul scenario to beat this guy, you got to really think you can beat them. Right. Otherwise

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       you'd just be dumb. Alright, next, remove the ladder. When the enemy has ascended to the roof. This is another one that kind of is a little bit contradictory with Bates and deceptions. Laura, your enemy into treasures. Treacherous terrain then caught off his lines of communication and avenue of escape to save himself. He must fight both your own forces and the elements of nature. Okay, I see what makes a little bit different. It's the elements of nature partner. Yeah, because otherwise we're just doing something that we talked about wasn't good, which is don't give them any escape. Then they're going to fight really hard, but if you put them in a situation where they've got to fight to both the elements of nature and you, that makes sense.

Speaker 2:          00:57:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:04       29 deck the tree with false blossoms. Tying silk blossoms on a dead tree gives the illusion that the tree is healthy through the use of artifice and disguise. Make something of no value, appear valuable of no threat. Appear dangerous of no use a peer useful. Pretty straightforward.

Speaker 2:          00:57:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:57:29       No. Who does a lot of that stilts and your role with stilts? He like Bates, he puts his arms, he's super flexible. Yes. And he'll put his arm way over there and it'll be all obvious. I've, I've tried to tell him stilts when you hear this, if you backed off your, your exposure a little bit, it'd be more believable. Yeah. Right. Cause it smell real. It doesn't smell real easily. He liked taps the ground with his arm but he sticks it all out there. Like any bends it enough. So it's almost an a perfect camera like we're going to do is go for this but he's so flexible. If you go for it, he's going to off balance. He's going to put his hooks in cause he's six foot something like six foot six year and super flexible. You ever think with him, I don't know if this is the case or not.

Speaker 1:          00:58:15       We ever think cause I think there's every once in a while where he's overdoing it because he's trying, you know it's like a like a charades. You're right. That might be part of it. Yeah. You know, he's over doing that so much that you don't do it. Cause I'd actually actually you're right, we've had that conversation. He's told me before that sometimes he would stick something out cause he knew I had it so good that if you just tried to make it look so obviously I wouldn't go for it. He was right. He's actually correct. There's a lot of times when I see him do something like I am suspect with everything he does, everything he does, I'm suspect. Yup. Any 200% like you think you're going to pass the guard. He's going to, he's got some little scam going. Yeah. He's trying to trick you. Yep. So be careful. Number 30 some scam scam. It's going to stab you in the door. Make the host and the guest exchange roles. You serp leadership in a situation where you are normally subordinate. Infiltrate your target initially. Pretend to be a guest to be accepted but develop from inside and become the owner later. Tell it's the same, same, same

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       hair already talked about with the fire department scenario because that method is a lot better than the method of battleaxe cause you won't even make it through the front door if you're holding an ax. Right. Then I'm gonna let you in. They're actually, the more I kind of listened to you kind of is the, the battle ax approach. Really. Most of the time, all that does is create another war. He just basically took one war and made another war in there. Now you got two major wars, by the way, that's, it seems to be the result, you know, just to give everyone a little bit of relief where the battle ax is appropriate, a hundred percent appropriate is with yourself and your own life. You know what I mean? That's the difference. That doesn't give anybody relief. Yeah, it does. Because you can use that. You want to use it, you want to use it, but you gotta use it on yourself, not on herself.

Speaker 3:          01:00:16       I want, Oh, you're saying people don't want you to at yourself. How do you going to fix yourself? You fix it. All right, well listen, I mean, we'll get that weakness and no real. Let's see. That's the exact thing I'm talking about with you, because the strange thing is that the other methodology doesn't work with yourself. If you're like negotiating with Chris [inaudible]. You know what, I'm not really that way. He can. I'm going to play the long game with myself. I'm just one donut. Not that big of a deal. I mean really, I don't know. Nope, don't do that. Battleaxe yeah, see, so that yet again, it goes along with your whole thing where I don't want to hear that when I say I want to bring up the battle ax fright jungle. Right. You want it to be for everyone else causing the problems.

Speaker 3:          01:01:01       But that's not the way it works. Only can use the battleax on yourself. That's where you use it. And when you do that, what you do is you do solve the problem. It's the actual, so what's interesting, there's a dichotomy here I tell people with, with everyone else, don't use the battle ax. That's where they want to use the battle ax. They don't want to use the battleax on themselves. But that's where I tell him to use the battleax. Yeah, it's a strange world fair that rights are out. Life gets a lot easier. It's harder at first, but he ends up easier. But yeah, it's, it's so 1000 million percent can something be a thousand million percent? Surely, but if it could be one of the one of those things and it's yet again, one of your things where it's like, Hey Jocko, I'm trying to do this. I need to do this.

Speaker 3:          01:01:48       Tell me the best way to do it, and your, and your answer isn't okay. This is how you do this better. It's, hey, you don't want to do that. You want to do this. Oh, by the way, that's the exact opposite of what you think you need to do. That's your whole thing. Same exact thing with your battle ax analogy. I'm like, Hey, I need to take a battle ax to my boss, man. He just doesn't get it. All this stuff and you're like, Oh yeah, oh no, you don't. You actually have to take the battleax yourself. That's your whole thing. Yes it is. Yeah, because if you take the battle ax your boss, so you're going to get hit, you create another war to yourself and you cut off the

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       the hostility. You smash the d, The hostility that you have towards your boss. If you use the battleax on that hostility and you start treating them with respect and trying to build a relationship, guess what? You're going to win. If you use the battle ox on him, he's going to break out a bigger battle ax and guess what? He has one because he's the boss. He's got a much bigger battle ax.

Speaker 3:          01:02:42       Yes, he does, and technically isn't that the whole watering the roots thing?

Speaker 2:          01:02:46       You know

Speaker 1:          01:02:48       the systemic problem solving. Start with yourself. You know, that's, that's definitely part of it. That's part of it. In their next stratagems for desperate situations, number 31 the beauty trap. Send your enemy beautiful women to cause discord within his camp. This strategy can work on three levels. First, the ruler becomes so enamored with the beauty that he neglects his duties and allows his vigilance to Wayne. Second other males at court will begin to display aggressive behavior that inflames minor differences, hindering cooperation and destroying morale. Third other females at court motivated by jealousy and envy begin to plot intrigues further exacerbating the situation. This is also known as the honey trap.

Speaker 3:          01:03:41       The honey trap. They do that on Rambo. First blood part too. He had that. Remember that cohort, you have them check him and he had a girl, a Vietnamese girl, if I'm not mistaken, and he meets her, her name is Ko. Yeah. So they go and they got to take down, you know they got to say the Po adobes and the girl disguises herself as I think a Vietnamese prostitute if I'm not mistaken on a moped. Honey trap. Yeah. So they're like, oh, neglecting their duties, all this stuff. Boom. They come in. But to add to the whole scenario, she's like actual warrior either. So it's like double layers and you know she's getting after it, getting totally getting after it. Check number 32

Speaker 1:          01:04:28       the empty Fort Strategy when the enemy is superior numbers in your situation is such that you expect to be overrun that any moment than drop all pretense of military preparedness and act calmly so that the enemy will think you're setting an ambush. The strategy is to be used sparingly and only after one has first developed a reputation for military prowess. This also depends on having a clever opponent who in proceeding the trap may overthink his reaction.

Speaker 1:          01:04:59       Don't takes guts, but I guess the the, it normally takes guts, but you might not have any other choice. Right? Like you're choking your chances like, okay, we're just going to act like this is no big deal. Just going to act like this is no big deal. Who was telling me a story about that? Maybe it was you or it was jade about being an Australia where you're telling me about that was that jade? Possibly. What was the store like? Oh yeah, I was telling you going into the alley. Yeah, I was telling you about jade story. Okay. Yeah. Was that on the podcast that you did that? I don't think so, but the point is, jade had a choice act like, okay, so he sees a situation could be hostile, and his choice was like, okay, I don't really have a choice here. I can either act scared, in which case I'm going to become a victim that's, that's, or I can act nonchalant and there's a possibility I don't become a victim because they see that I'm like, whatever. Right? And so that's what he did. And guess what? The guy was like, good. Hey Man. Oh good. Yeah. Luckily we said Australia.

Speaker 1:          01:06:05       Next 33 let the enemy's own spy. So discord in the enemy camp undermine your enemy's ability to fight by secretly causing discord between him and his friends, allies, advisers, families, commander soldiers in population. While he is preoccupied in settling internal disputes, his ability to attack or defend is compromised. For some reason. I have the word truth written here,

Speaker 1:          01:06:35       and I think the reason, oh, this is what I have, that this is why I have that there. I was thinking to myself, how do you do this? And the, one of the best ways to sow discord amongst people is to tell them the truth about what's happening. How so? Well, you've got some enemy camp and you start, you start saying, hey look, you should say, look how look how the bosses living. God. It's just pay attention to how the boss of it, I'm just telling you the truth. The truth is the boss eaten crab legs every night. You guess what? You're eating chicken patties. No, no, no. So I was on the ship, I think it was the, I think it was a u s as Cleveland, and there was an underground newspaper on the ship, but there was basically leakers that we're telling the troops, the sailors on the ship, what they were eating in the wardroom where the officers were.

Speaker 1:          01:07:29       That word started getting around to chicken patties. Dryton chicken patties for 48 days straight. You know what? No. Hey, that's a lot of chicken patties. You're not, you're not gonna, you're not gonna want any more chicken patties. No, but then you get word that they're eating crab legs. That was the big one. I don't even like crab legs, but everyone else seemed like crab legs. They were mad when they found out that's what the wardrobe. So what they did was just the just telling the truth. Cause discord. Just tell him the truth. Yeah, makes sense. Now of course you could weave in some lies, right? But just I'm saying is oftentimes the truth is the most powerful weapon. Yeah. To cause discord. Now I'll always tell you that truth is the most powerful weapon. Definitely truth is the most powerful weapon that you have. Like just in general.

Speaker 1:          01:08:18       Just in general. Just in general. The truth is the most powerful weapon you have for yourself. Be truthful with yourself. If you can be truthful with people around you. Now does. Does this mean you tell the truth every single time? No, because you, sometimes the chicken is dry and you just need to do that to yourself. Right? That's a legit, why don't we talk about that before, but truth, truth is definitely the most powerful tool that you have and even when it comes to creating discord, the best, let me put it to you this way. Let me just, I don't want to go through this whole tangent, but the best, if you're going to create discord, it's more powerful to create discord using the truth than it is trying to create discord because the lie can be unwound, figured out the truth when they go, well, no, that's not true, and then you go, oh wait, that is true as a real problem. 34 inflict injury on oneself to when the enemy's trust pretending to be injured has two possible applications in the first. The enemy's lulled into relaxing his guard since he no longer considers you an immediate threat. The second is a way of ingratiating yourself to your enemy by pretending the energy the injury was caused by a mutual enemy.

Speaker 1:          01:09:32       Build that little bit of trust. Remember when I talked about, remember when I talked about when you, if you come to me and you're emotional, you're all mad about something and I have to to tamper down the emotion, but I can't. I have to show you some of the same emotion. I reflect it, but I diminish it a little bit. Yeah. That's a way of building trust between us. Right? Well, it's the same thing. If I'm, I called liquid, you come and look what they did to me and I go, look what they did to me to say thing. They wounded me to look at this. I'm also mad at them. We're a team now. I do that with my daughter, by the way. What's a, when she, she had a hangnail last night, even hangnail and she didn't know what a hang nail is. I think it's her first hangnail just five sad.

Speaker 1:          01:10:17       It's sad. All those hanging on. What hangnails coming your way. All those hangnail future for a, so I'm like, yeah, I see. Just little things. Yeah. That used to happen to me when I was a little too, so it's kind of like, oh, we both kind of have that same scenario. Same thing, dude. Mutual. Hey, mail, hatred. You know, let's bring the team together and uniting against hang nails. I'm telling you it's real. It's real name, ma'am. I'm a hundred percent onboard. Hanging rails are real. I didn't know you had hangnails man, when I have them too tight, a little bit of bond. 35 chain stratagems in important matters, one should use several stratagems applied simultaneously after another as an a chain of stratagems. Keep different plans operating in an overall scheme. However, in this manner, if any one stratagem fails, then the chain breaks and the whole scheme fails.

Speaker 1:          01:11:15       Now I completely agree with the first part of this, which is, yeah, you should train these things together, which is obviously what we do in Jujitsu. You use one move in that setting up another move, which is setting up another move, moving the defense. That one's, that's another move, but I don't agree with the fact that if one of them breaks, they all the whole thing falls apart, but that shouldn't be necessarily true. You should set up your strategy gyms, you're stratagems that you expect that some of them are not, are going to fail a little bit and that's okay because that's why he got the backup ones right. Am I wrong? I don't think you're wrong. No. And chaining things together. That's you have to do that. You have to hit from multiple angles and you have to have, that's how, that's the Ooda loop, right?

Speaker 1:          01:11:54       That's okay, I'm going to do this and then you're going to react. I'm going to do this, I'm gonna be there. And when the next one there, where the next one in there with the next one having a heads up on things make such a big difference. In other words, just so much of winning in Jujitsu is that I know what you're gonna do before you do it. So much of winning in combat is I know what you're going to do before you do it. Setting these things up properly, chaining them together so that the enemy doesn't know the opponent, doesn't know the next thing in the chain, but you do. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:12:25       Yeah. I think he, that's powerful. Yeah, I agree that it seems like you're looking at it like the, the, the chain of stratagems is like a totem pole where it should be like a tree or like a web or something where you can kind of go and this can break off and, but yeah, his one is like, like a straight up like actual chain know one link breaks. It's like yes, but true.

Speaker 1:          01:12:51       Last one, number 36 if all else fails, retreat, important one. If it becomes obvious that your current course of action will lead to defeat, then retreat and regroup when you're aside is losing. There are only three choices. Remaining. Surrender, compromise or escape. Surrender is complete defeat. We don't want that. Compromise is half. Defeat might be an okay outcome, especially when compared to the alternative, which is just surrender, which is total defeat. But escape is not defeat.

Speaker 2:          01:13:40       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:13:42       As long as you are not defeated, you will still have a chance. And I think that's a fitting end to this. And again, this is something that people get wrapped around all the time. They don't want to give up, they don't want to give up. They don't want to give up. In skydiving, you have a malfunction. If you have a malfunction, you, you try and fix it for a little while at

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       2000 feet. I think it was what I learned in the military. Free Fall

Speaker 1:          01:14:19       at 2000 feet, you make the decision, I'm not going to get that parachute open. I'm going to cut that one away. I'm going to bring out my secondary. But guys would, you know, in the parachute world, and right now the parachutes are getting so good that it's, it's a lot more rare. But guys would get target fixation on trying to fix the bad parachute that was up there and they'd look at it and look at it and try and fix it and try and fix it and try and fix it and try and fix it. And then they, they did hit. So sometimes you got to retreat. It's okay.

Speaker 2:          01:14:54       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:14:55       it's okay. Surrender is complete. Defeat. Compromise is half the feet, but escape is not defeat it. As long as you are not defeated, you still have a chance. So retreating is smart. Sometimes it's okay. And I think that's a good lesson. It's okay to retreat but never, never surrender. And that's that book, which definitely some good lessons in there running some new ones, reinforced some other ones, hoping that everyone out there listening learned something from that too. And if you did any want to give the podcasts some support

Speaker 3:          01:15:41       Baja and here's how you can do it and support yourself by the way actually could be the more important thing. I think so. Yes. I think it's the more important thing. Yeah man. Cause he yet like on the plane, right? You know the oxygen masks since coming down real. Right. You can't just start putting the mask on your kid. No. What if you suffered Kate? Yup. Can't help. Nobody knows where it just help yourself first. You can't support what we're doing here if you're not on the path. Exactly right. Yeah. That's the primary thing. Yeah. That's what we're about to begin. Good way. Let's start with the origin feeding name for the way to begin the support and get it. Origin layers in the industry, we call it those layers. Anyway, origin. This is what origins is a American made company that delivers American made products starting with geese, Jujitsu gies for Jujitsu, not just generic gies name on it.

Speaker 1:          01:16:45       Yeah. Not that, no, not generic. I'm telling you that that's aren't the kind of geese where you'd be like, Hey, you know what, I think I'm going to go down to the market right now. Yeah. I'm going to put on my g you don't, you maybe if you're doing that you'd maybe don't need an origin gay. You get whatever you who go down to the market. But if you're doing Jujitsu with your g yeah. We recommend you go with uh, the, the origin g which is made in America, which is awesome. The cotton is grown. Yeah. It's grown here. American hands. People are working, people are working in Maine. We're bringing that back. So yeah. Get those and rash guards as well. Yeah. Woven, woven material here. Yeah, they kind of got everything. They got, uh, you know, regular clothes as well. Joggers, sweat suits. [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          01:17:32       I was having a discussion, which I'm not going to go into, but I will go into this part of the discussion. I was in discussion with someone that was like basically telling me like, well, you know this, this business, this business is hard. What we do is hard in this business. You're trying to tell me that what they were doing in this business was hard. I was like, Hey, it's not that hard what you're doing and trust me, what they're doing is not that hard. Trust me. There's some businesses I work with a lot of different businesses. I'm complex businesses out there in the world. Really Complex. The business particularly that I was talking to that was having this discussion with, that was telling me how hard their business was, which, what does that sound like to you when someone's like, Oh, you know, it's really hard.

Speaker 1:          01:18:12       That's an excuse. Of course. Hey, if it was easy, everyone would be doing it, right? Yeah. You know, it's really hard. This business is really hard and I was like, you want to talk about hard? I'm like tried getting an ancient loom up and running and weaving material that hasn't been done in 40 years. Here in America we've, there's 8 million little threads going into this thing. Try sorting that out. Telling me your business is hard. Yeah, that seems hard. That's hard. But it's being done right here in America at origin. Really good stuff on there. Also supplements, Jocko supplements, joint warfare, Krill oil and discipline and milk. So consider these four. They all kind of play into each other. Joint Warfare, obviously warfare against degeneration of joints, not against your joints. It's for the joints. It's your joint sweet Jean War on degeneration anyway, however you want to spin it.

Speaker 1:          01:19:15       And then the lessons for your joints. Krill oil, same thing. Omega threes really good for general health as well. If you like protein supplements. Moke see what I did there. I didn't call it protein powder. That's good. That's good. It's a very understated too, which I'm down with. You can not understate it. Yeah cause the bottom line is if you like delicious things in the world, you're going to like milk. So milk is peanut or not peanut butter. It's good to be. It's about the chocolate butter. Yeah, those are, those are inbound. Yeah. Someone sent me a picture tweet, I think it was on Twitter. One had chocolate milk, jug other hand milk. He said, I'm going to take it for the team to the experiment. Remember I said mix the milk with chocolate milk. Might be too chocolaty. Might be he just said he's going to do it. He didn't report that verdict. That's kind of just indicated

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       he was commencing with the experiment that's Kinda jacked up. We will have mark at the immersion camp, Jujitsu immersion camp, August 26 through September 2nd up in Maine on Echo Lake layers. So come up and hang out with me with Lafe, with echo, with Dave Burke. Still not 100% on JP, but yeah, we're going to be up there in Maine doing Jujitsu and hanging out. Oh and D Dean lister. Oh yeah. No big deal. The muster and Andy's going to, it looks like Andy's going Burke. Andy Burke's gonna be going. So we will be all just training and getting after it. And hanging out. Here's the thing, it doesn't sound as dealt when we were they hanging out. But here's the thing. It is ultimately cause you can learn. You can only do Jujitsu. How many hours a day can you do Jiu Jitsu? You know, it depends on who you are.

Speaker 3:          01:20:56       Obviously call it eight. We'll call it eight. So eight and eight. So eight hours. Then you sleep for eight hours. What does that leave you ate more so more hours. You got to fill those eight hours I hanging out. That's eight hours. Eight hours a crew. Could we cruising? Cruising. Sorry. I'll be cooking big time. If I'm not doing this. You should actually, so I'll be halfway in halfway out because you've got the injury limited, limited, limited, but we'll, we'll just say limit anyway. Yes, yes. August 26th to September 2nd. Is it also good way to support his go to Jocko store.com that's right. Chocolate is a store. It's called Jocko store. Anyway, it's where you can get tee shirts, rash guards, hoodies, hats, you know, all these stuff. A products, we'll say that we put out discipline equals freedom shirts.

Speaker 3:          01:21:49       What's the new one? What did I put on there that's new. Oh, is there a new discipline equals freedom shirt. Is that up yet? Yes, it's not up yet. It will be up in a couple of weeks. It'll be up in a couple of, maybe even one week. So it could be up technically by the time. So it's so it's up. It's up, right? It's cool. The new shirt is up. Yeah, just one equals three new one. Um, but yeah, if you want to represent, go there Jocko. store.com. Use the word represent. I like that. There it is. I think it's the new one is uh, take the high ground or the high ground. I'll take you. That's a fact. Something like that. Shit. Unless if you, um, actually where we email list, right. And I don't really talk about this, offer it and didn't want it to be an annoying thing.

Speaker 3:          01:22:35       You know how sometimes you go to a website, it'll pop up in your face and you can't like move, you know, I try not to because people want to, they actually used the word they want to capture. Capture. Yeah. Capture your email. Yeah. Technically, yeah. I don't want to capture when we're so out in you and what is not in the game. Like you, you just said like how, I mean even your tone indicated how you feel when a pop up with a form, you know, comes in. It's kind of like when you um, like let's say you go on a first date with someone and they give you like a contract or something. It's Kinda like, hey, sign this before we can take any steps forward with what we already plan. We were doing, by the way anyway. I know we do have an email list.

And also if you didn't know we got the warrior kid podcast, which yeah, you might not think that you would listen to it, but if you've got kids, definitely they'll dig it and good podcast to listen to. Lately. I've been, lately I've been telling the stories from uncle Jake from when uncle Jake was a kid. Uncle Jake is sharing stories of his childhood that have little lessons in them. Big lesson, even big lessons and, but, but they're not they're stories. Yep. And that's been kind of the direction the last couple of podcasts have had a uh, a story from uncle Jake story from Uncle Jake that we can all learn from. So that is the warrior kid podcast. I answer some questions from for more of your kids and then they're short too. They're 20 minutes

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       because kids should not be sitting around listening to a four hour podcasts. We only do that cause we got to like work to do commute and all that stuff. Yard work. Yeah, it's good. It's kind of good for the parent actually. Really good for the parents and teachers by the way. No, I've gotten great feedback from parents and teachers. Absolutely. You're awesome. These quiz questions, the Q and a questions, you know, they send in and you answer them eloquently. I might add uncle Jack's pretty eloquent. Yeah, I like to think so for sure. Uh, but you know, in real life these, these kids ask their parents these questions or the teacher, you know, and sometimes, you know, maybe the teacher on the spot, maybe he's busy or maybe they don't know or something like that. So like, you know, I, I see it, I know that I do it for myself.

Speaker 3:          01:26:48       When I listened to him I'm like, okay, boom. Cause I've heard that question before and these answers a little bit better than mine. You know, Jack, uh, also the youtube channel. Yeah. We've got a youtube channel, it's called Jocko podcast and that's where echo puts the videos and the video excerpts and enhanced video excerpts. So you can check that out too, which is cool. And Yeah, yeah, do that. It's good. A good way to support for sure. Subscribe to, you already said iTunes and stuff, Google play. So that's a good way to start that seemingly an easy obvious thing, but it is a good way to support legitimately check also on it.com/jocko by the way. Okay. What is on it? We all know it on and it is, but if you don't know, it's where you can get the best fitness gear. It's where you get all mine.

Speaker 3:          01:27:46       Oh, it's going to get a bag or like the sandbag things. Yeah, I got one. Okay. Yeah, they're good. They're good. Yeah. Like so it was, I forget it was good for the big functional strategy. Yeah. Like you know how, um, do you know what I've got to figure out though. Remember that bag that they had up in Maine, the 200 pound bag, I got to figure out what the deal is with that so I can rehearse. Actually, it's pretty simple. If you've got to make a game 10 10 adjustment to do it, you'd be like, okay, this is mark. Depress it. No, just clean it. Yeah. Put it over your shoulder. You have to shoulder. Yeah. Okay. So the thing is, and I tell me if this is cheating. Okay. So to lay out the scenario, there's a 200 pound bag of gravel. Not that's what it is.

Speaker 3:          01:28:35       Yeah. 200 pounds, which is him. No handles, no handles. It's a sack of gravel, not a canvas like made out of the either. It's like nylon. Yeah. So it's real flowy. 200 pounds dead. You'd see dead weight. It's extra dead weight anyway. So then you got to just put it on your shoulder. That's it. Pick it up, pick it up off the ground, putting your show. So tell me if this is cheating. So I did it in a, I succeeded but I try not the first time I tried it once and I was like whoa. And you know it falls down and I'm like man. But uh, Mike, one of the guys there, he said, hey, when you lift it up first you got to keep the weight on the forward part because even when you lift it up, it kind of divides the bag kind of India because it flows, you know, all the gravel kind of flows to the, to the ends or whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:29:26       You got to divide it up. But when you divide it up, you got to keep more of the weight. More on the, on the, on the front part, not on the, the part closer to you because it'll just flow down and it just doesn't work. His, his explanation way more short than that. But um, so is that cheating? So I was like, all right, I did it and then I, and then it was easy. No, it's not easy. Okay. So it's, yeah, it's hard. Like if you practice or something, it'll be easy course. I mean, you're strong enough to do it for sure. But the technique or some techniques to get it up there. Yeah, it's, it's, it's hard. But nonetheless, um, the, my point was with the bag is, you know how, you know, you lift a bunch of weights and this guy and or me or whatever, we can bench a lot, squat a lot. But then, you know, when you're doing like yard work and you gotta I dunno, shovel a bunch of dirty wheelbarrow and you're picking it up and you're trying to lift it up this little hill and you're like,

Speaker 1:          01:30:20       well, the second your role with guys that work construction, they have, they have legit strength that comes to the other side.

Speaker 3:          01:30:25       Exactly right. So I'm like, man, I'll buy one of these bags and just sort of like have it part of the workout, you know, do some hills or something with it. But anyway, on it.com/ [inaudible] and there's a lot of cool stuff on there. Then he says, and kettle bells and whatnot,

Speaker 1:          01:30:41       all kinds of good stuff. Uh, psychological warfare album being get on iTunes, Google play and be through. We're working on the second one.

Speaker 1:          01:32:06       How to get after it. Demand you on how to get after it and kind of stay after it and stay because if you get after it for a couple hours and then that's all the getting after you're doing.

It's not on audible, extreme ownerships. The other book been out for awhile. It's still people still buying it and it's about leadership. It's about combat leadership in how to

Speaker 1:          01:32:45       use combat leadership principles in your business and your life and obviously in combat as well. And then on top of that life and I have a new book that we are, I keep saying that we just finished it. I think it was Tim Ferriss I heard say like, oh he was writing a book and he goes yeah I'm done with my book. And one of his friends that was a writer was like okay cool you're 50% there and that's the truth. When you get done writing it, you're 50% there cause there's a ton of work that you still have to do. I finished around of edits yesterday and what's cool is reading the book, I'm super stoked on the book and people are going to get a lot out of it. It's called the dichotomy of leadership. It comes out September 25th my publisher who listens to this podcast who hears me say these things doesn't get it or not going to order enough books.

Speaker 1:          01:33:30       They're like, well you know, you never know when we don't want to take too much risk. Order the book now so that you get a book when it comes out first the dish, you don't want second a dish, third a and that's lifetime evidence that you weren't in the game. Don't let it happen. And then when you meet me and you're like, Hey, can you sign in? You're signing my book. And I was like, cool, y'all sign your second edition sadness. The first edition I'll be like, hey we go back, we go back. So like the second edition you'll just sort of sign your name and then with a line or something. But the first edition of the Games that you went to supports that whole one, and we are here together. Oh, second edition. How you doing? Poser. Poser. If you get the second dish.

Speaker 1:          01:34:19       Well, anyways, all kidding aside. That's coming out September 25th if you want to get that dichotomy of leadership, how to balance all those little things, you got to balance as a leader. That's what you gotta do.
