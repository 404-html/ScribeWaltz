Speaker 1:          00:00          Do I ever feel like Sisyphus? Yeah, of course do. I've been waiting for people to start saying like, oh, you put another picture of the sweat and have a squat rack. Really,

Speaker 2:          00:23          but

Speaker 1:          00:25          I don't know if they understand. I've been getting on that squat rack, grinding it out for 25 years, and I'm not bored with it yet. It might seem like that's an unwinnable battle, but really to me, it's not about winning. It's the battle itself. It's the struggle. It's the daily test. That's what life's about. Not just physically, but mentally getting that rock to the top of the mountain. That's not what my goal is. My goal actually is she'd go rock because pushy.
