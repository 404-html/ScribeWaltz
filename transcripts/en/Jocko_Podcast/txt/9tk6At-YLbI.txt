Speaker 1:          00:00:01       This is Jocko podcast number 91 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. And we are rolling straight into Q and a today. So questions from the interwebs. Echo Charles Gulf go. Okay, first question Jocko. I've just finished about faith, the book, amazing book, interested how you modeled your style on Hackworth though hack was a renegade in always bending the rules to break to the breaking point, but in extreme ownership he talk about, for example, not pushing back on higher command when it came to Iraqi troops. Have listened to podcasts too, but was hoping you could go into it a bit more. Yeah, so I guess that that's a good question. Hack. He was kind of considering a renegade, but, but also he's also a total company man that you got to realize that there's that dichotomy there. There's a guy that hack, loved the army, he loved the army, he wanted his uniform would look super squared away.

Speaker 1:          00:01:12       He followed all the rules and regulations that, and he supported the leadership all the time when the leadership was right and that's what makes him a good renegade. In my opinion and I was very much the same way. I was all about the navy. You know, I was all about the games as a matter of fact tone. You know what Tony used to say? Uh, it was a little thing we got going in to you bruiser that spread around. But of course it came from Tony First, which was all navy all the time. We'd just be joking about, you know, I think, I don't know what originally caused it, but like guys would make fun of me because I would wear like jungle boots or Dan or boots out too on liberty with a clear of like old jeans. Yeah. Cause when you're, when you're like that kind of old just raised in the teams, you don't even know any different and you're like, oh well I'm going out and I need to wear shoes.

Speaker 1:          00:02:06       Cool. Where's my jungle boots? That's what you end up like. And, and you're into it. You're not like, you think it's good. You think it's normal. Like this is the way things are. And so I supported the teams and hack supported the army of course. But this is the thing, if the leadership was wrong or there was something being passed down that was wrong and it was a big wrong, like if it was a little, I wouldn't be like, Oh man, this is crap. They're making us wear a different pair of shorts now. Because like that would happen. Like some new commanding officer would come in and change some thing, right. And some, well we got to do that. We're, it's like, dude, be quiet. You know, just be quiet. Do you know they're giving you a new shorts where the new shorts, you know, oh, they're telling us we can't wear baseball hats anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:02:51       Cool. Don't wear baseball hats. And some grass would go, who cares? I don't care what I'm wearing on my head. You know, like, oh you want to issue with different ball caps are fine, whatever. But then if it was a larger issue then or, or obviously if it was something that was like actually wrong, like criminally wrong or morally wrong or something like that, then yeah, I'd be like, no, we can't do that. So the reason that I didn't push back on Iraqi troops in working with Iraqi troops when we got to Ramadi was because as I looked at it, I realized that it was the right thing to do and yes, it was going to be more dangerous. And yes, a definitely took us out of our comfort zone. But as I explain in extreme ownership, if we didn't train those people up, if we didn't train the Iraqi soldiers and take them out and get them fighting and get them squared away on the battlefield, then Americans would have been doing it forever.

Speaker 1:          00:03:51       So it was the correct call was to do that. Now I've, I've talked about the same, same thing. When they told us our ratio, they gave us a ratio of how many Iraqis we had to have for every one Iraqi we had to have, I don't know what their, I forget what the number was, seven or, or for every one seal we had to have seven Iraqi soldiers. They said that something like that. I forget what the numbers were. And I said, no, that doesn't make sense to us because sometimes we only have 10 guys to go out and I'm, there's no way I'm sending only one seal with 10 Iraqi soldiers not doing it. Need a corpsman, need to radio man, need a machine, gunner need a leader like that. That's what I need. So, and when I pushed back because I didn't push back against ball caps and because I didn't push back against some stupid uniform change, ah, they were like, oh yeah, well that actually makes sense.

Speaker 1:          00:04:44       Chocolate. We don't want you to go on the field with only one seal. So I would clearly pushed back if it was something that didn't make sense. Same thing with like the martial arts training that they had us doing in the, in the late nineties and early two thousands. It was not good. And I was told everyone, hey, this is not smart. This is not good. This training is dumb. We need to do other training that's better. Uh, and, and same thing, you know, things go, oh, like here's another like stupid example. They wouldn't want to issue a platoon that the radio was, you are going to take on deployment because they didn't want you to break them or whatever. And so they'd issue not enough radios for everyone. And so now not everyone does know how to operate the radios and you're basically operationally testing the radios while you're going through your workup.

Speaker 1:          00:05:32       So I said, hey, this is garbage issue, everyone radios if that's how we operate, that's how we need to train. Gotcha. So in the training they would an issue that the radios, yeah, there was a time period where we low on radios and they said we're going to keep these radios for deployment and it's, that doesn't make sense. I got a good idea by more radios. Uh, so, you know, those were things I pushed back on it and you were always pushing back on the type of training that was going to happen and who is going to be, how you're going to run the training. So, um, when something we didn't made sense to push back, I pushed back just like Hackworth did. Now, Hackworth did it on a massive scale because he eventually pushed back on the way the war in Vietnam was being run.

Speaker 1:          00:06:11       And had I been smart enough and the war didn't take the shift that it took and we didn't move towards counterinsurgency and we didn't make those adjustments that the, that carnal McFarland implemented in Ramadi. Maybe, maybe, I doubt it. Maybe I would have been smarter to say, Hey, we're not running this war right. We need to do something different and run it up the chain of command. But, but at the time, you know, Colonel Mcfarlane made great decisions. He led, he had a great plan, a great strategy, so I was 100% on board. Um, but if you don't Hackworth, that didn't happen. They were not fighting correctly against the Vietnamese and, and they were taking massive casualties for a hill that two days later they'd give back. And so he was saying, what are you doing? And, and the other thing, you know, when he took over the hardcore battalion, they were fighting for months and they had, they had literally killed almost, no, anyway, I think it was zero.

Speaker 1:          00:07:06       I think there's actually zero enemy. And yet they had taken all kinds of casualties themselves. And so he'd say, w w this is wrong, this is wrong. So I think that's, that's what being a leader is. You support the stuff, you support the command. Yes, of course we support the command when it makes sense and as long as it makes sense and normally it's gonna make sense. You know what I mean? Normally it's going to make sense. It's not like the, the admirals and the generals are saying, hey, how can we lose this war? Let's come up with a stupid strategy. No, they're doing the best they can. So it's not like it's a regular occurrence. I mean, like I said, when I was working for Carter, Colonel Mcfarland, he was a smart guy. He was a brilliant guy that had a great strategy of, I'm like, okay, awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:07:44       I'm here to support. Um, and, and I'll tell you when I did, and this is, I think this is important, is that even though I was kind of a renegade and I was more rebellious when I was a kid, obviously I, I was, uh, I was young when I got the seal teams then. So, you know, we would push all of those things where I said that, oh, we got to do this. That was me when I was at e four in the seal teams. You know, what do we go do that we should just be able to do whatever we want. You know, we were just stupid. But as I got older, I realized that you need to come across as a renegade quote, unquote, to come across as a big rebel. That doesn't, well, immediately when you go and push back on something, everyone just dismisses you.

Speaker 1:          00:08:23       Oh yeah. Jocko, he's just a loud mouth. He just, he just pushed it back against everything he doesn't want. He's wanting to do everything his way. No. You want them to say, Oh wow, hold on a second. If jockos pushing back against this, then this, this must be something wrong here because he doesn't push back against stuff. He tells the line all the time so we should listen to them. That's what you want to build. That's what I did my best to build and that's how I think it would be comparable to the way Hackworth led and the way that I tried to, obviously I know Hackworth, but I stole as much as I could from him and the weird thing is, I'll tell you this, I always say I stole from him, but it wasn't like I was sitting there reading a book and going, I'm going to do what he did here.

Speaker 1:          00:09:04       I think it was just absorbed and even even the naming of tasking at bruiser, like when I did it, I wasn't thinking this is what Hackworth did, but it was real obvious that that's where I got it from. Like, I didn't think I'm going to rename this and again, we're going to turn this thing around based order would not turn it around, but we're going to build this based on, no, I was like, you know what? We're not going to be Task Unit Bravo cause that sounds lame or maybe task you had a bruiser because that sounds awesome. You and, and, and then later, you know, I was like fuck. I'm like, Oh God, that's right. That's exactly what Hackworth did. I obviously stole it from him, so appreciate it. Act. But that's what I'd say be a renegade. But that's should be, that should be in the background. That should be in the back of your mind, in the front of your mind. Should be, hey, I'm a supporter of what's happening.

Speaker 1:          00:09:53       Kind of like the willingness to be a real renegade if you have to. Yeah, yeah. If you have to end, believe me, I've known all kinds of good seals that were to renegade. Yeah, yeah. That's just like I'm a Renick. Yeah, they're just straight up, hey, I'm a renegade. And, and you know that just the only guys that could get away with that, well guys that were so ultimately operationally squared away. Yeah. That people go, yeah, you know, he's kind of a maniac, but dude, he's really, really good and really tactically sound and all that. And they could, they make that happen. Now as you get more and more senior homie don't play like that after a certain point, it's done. And you've got to get, you've got to play the game. That's what you got to do. As you get more senior, got to play the game. And from like your subordinates viewpoint, if, if they looked at me and go, oh, jock was just playing the game. He's just doing it to be guests. I am. Yes I am. Because this way it gives me more ability to control everything that's going to impact you. People that work for me. So yes, I'm going to play the game so you don't have to. You're welcome.

Speaker 1:          00:10:58       So yeah, check your math. Makes Sense. Next question. Jujitsu. Bjj Do. You did too during your time in Iraq, if you like, please paint me a picture. How to imagine a Bjj class from you as an active soldier. Did you have a g maths and how would it differ from a quote unquote normal class? Um, so yeah, I always brought mass with me starting with 1998 I think is when I started bringing maths with me. How do you bring meth? She just be like, Hey, in military transport you build something called a pallet. So you get a big palette and there there's like eight feet by eight feet are pretty big and you put stack all kinds of stuff on them and you know, you've got your weapons, you got your engines, you got your motors, you got your motors, you got your boats, your, your Zodiac boats, you've got paddled, you've got all this.

Speaker 1:          00:11:59       I mean all of the equipment [inaudible] everyone's personal gear is on their, their op gear, their body armor. It's all of these big pallets. And when you go on deployment, you'll have eight pallets, eight of these giant pallets. And so on some of those pallets there would be mats. So who is it up to though? You know, you're talking about weapons and Zodiacs and stuff and like, well whoever's in charge, which we're seeing a lot of times this week. So then it made it real easy and, and even if it wasn't me, I mean everybody, you know, if people are bringing something to help everyone get better, you know, I, yeah, that's cool. So in that approval process, no man, this guy's bringing all kinds of crazy things. This man, I remember guys, well, you know, you guys should bring surfboards. I mean they'd pack their surfboards on pallets, they pack a weights and squat racks and anything that you want.

Speaker 1:          00:12:50       If you're going on a six month deployment to remote location, yeah, you're going to put your load, have a squat rack and a bunch of bumper plates. And if that remote location has waves, you're packing surfboards. If it has, if it has, you know, rock climbing, you're going to pack rock climbing gear. I'm telling you, this is one of the things that it's really hard to the seal teams. It's really hard to have that. I think we, I think in the, the seal teams to have that better than most people. It was just this, this autonomy to kind of make things happen and do kind of cool stuff. And I'm not saying no, no one ever gets to do that. But you know, I don't think a regular army unit or regular Marine Corps unit would be putting, you know, seven surfboards on their peers. The where.

Speaker 1:          00:13:36       So where's the limit though? Like, so what can I, let's say we're going, can we get a TV? Can I get a tpa and PBM TVS? Like the big screen. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It just, it also depends on where you're deploying and what you're doing and what the mission is. Because you know, my first time to Iraq, we didn't have much of any of this stuff obviously. Right? We just had our op gear basically. And, but the second time, the second time I went to Iraq, we brought more, but we actually had to weld a squat rack is pretty awesome. There's a, there's a marine that, there was a great marine that was with us and he ran, he manned the radios and he was just a, just an awesome guy. And he was, he was a marine, but he was, there was marines across the river.

Speaker 1:          00:14:19       And so he was supposed to keep continuity and he got assigned to US anyways. Awesome guy. And he knew how to weld. He was from a farm up in Montana or something, so he knew how to weld and he had the gear and we didn't have a squat rack. And so our CBS, cause there's a bunch of cvs with us. They get, they were able to like just come up with stuff. They make anything happen. My, My, my head CB was just could see that's CBS build things I think also acquire things. Let's see. Comment builder. It's a combat engineer battalion. It's a construction battalion. That's what it is. So it's CB for short, but it's the CBS and so yeah, they build things and they also are very good at acquiring things. You know, things just show up at your, at your base. And my guys were awesome at acquiring things and we didn't have a squat rack, which is, which is crazy to me to be having no squat rack.

Speaker 1:          00:15:13       Right. Why, why don't you have a squat rack? So this, this marine welded a squat rack. Now here's the interesting part, the squat rack, he was, he was tall, he was like maybe six, four, six, five, maybe not that tall, but he was a mean guy, the marine welder. So on the squat rack there was, you know, there's adjustable to put the bar on. Well this didn't have adjustable things. It just had two hooks and there was one hook at his height or one set of hooks at his height and one set of hooks at my height. Everyone just had to figure it out from there, you know? But uh, but yeah, so yeah, you could bring, you could bring that if you want it to. And so, so yes, we brought maths, I brought maths on that deployment and both actually, both of my deployment to Iraq brought mats.

Speaker 1:          00:15:57       And then one of the classic, well generally you're training with people that don't know anything. And I would have trained with them under the workup, you know, so they're starting to learn and they're like, you know, low level white belts or mid level white belts or even high level wipe butts. I don't think we, I even had one blue belt on either one of my deployments. And the good thing is their team guys, they're athletic, they're strong, they're in good shape, they want to learn. So they learn fast, they're tough. They're like I said, strong and athletics. So you're going to get good roles. The more you teach them, the better the roles get. Talking about gay or Nogi we never, I never traveled with a g for the military, I don't think. And so what I started wearing almost all the time was Cammie pants and a tee shirt.

Speaker 1:          00:16:38       And what's cool is I did that when, as soon as I started Jujitsu, I was training with other seals that were in Cammie pants and a tee shirt because it didn't make sense to wear like a Camry top. And so what's cool is, without even knowing it when no one was training Nogi I was actually training Nogi because I did was just training with guys with tee shirts on it. Not even wearing pants, but, but anyway, so yeah, that's what we'd wear. Khaki pants and a tee shirt would, we occasionally put on OPG gear occasionally, but, but not, not very often. Uh, either. The other thing you got to watch out for with, with my former organization in the seal teams is there's guys that would go nuts, like they didn't want to tap cause you get major egos. And so Kaiser could occasionally goes psycho sometimes when I'd, when I pit per certain people against each other, sometimes I'd have to basically officiate slash be a safety officer to make sure that no one actually got killed because they'd be trying to kill each other and no one wants to tap. And you have to be like, hey man, you can't, you know, you're about to your arms about to get broken. Stop. So he had to do some of that. Uh, and I'm, I'm, I am a bit of an instigator. Yeah, sure. I mean,

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       you see it now, I still do it on the match today, you know, I mean if, if there's two guys that are going hard against each other, but maybe they're not going super hard. Yeah, yeah. They could go harder, real easy to escalate that I know. And so and so I would escalate matches between guys as well and, and then, you know, I just roll with everyone. So yeah. Well the class be like, we teach the moves just like a regular Jiu Jitsu class, teach the moves, go over some stuff and then roll and that's it. Pretty simple. Good Times. Yeah. I found that if you can do little drills with yourself, if you go, if you're a high level guy and you're going to with the white belt, especially if they're athletic, what you do is you, you know how like when you roll with a guy who was maybe one level give or take from you, you, um, or let's say they're one level lower, you'll kind of slowly put yourself into better or worst situations.

Speaker 2:          00:18:44       You won't go all out or nothing. Like, yeah, but this is kind of counterintuitive to, if you go with like a, like a beginner beginner, but their athletic, what you do is you try to, you think of a finish or make your session through that as fast as you possibly can. So if you're like, okay, I'm going to start on the bottom, we're going to force how many, no. Well, depends on what you mean. You don't have to force it. Yeah. But they're forcing our mock. If you say, I'm going to finish this an arm lock, you're gonna have to force him into that position somewhat. You can set it up. Sure. Yeah, exactly right. That's what that's really the drill is you got to set it up given what he does. And he could be retreating the whole time. Sure. It's going to, so it's going to take longer.

Speaker 2:          00:19:21       It's just, that's just how did you get to is, but um, that's the drill in your head rather than, you know, let's say an intuitive method to roll with a white belt is, let's just go light. Let's see what he does. Let them get and get a good position on you and then I'll work out or whatever, but no, don't do that and be like, okay, I'm going to treat this person like a person that I have to in real life. So do with, and you choose whatever it a good game to play actually that is a good game to play. And then you get real good at that and going from one thing and then it's also, I don't play that game very often. I don't know what, there's something that snaps in my head sometimes when I'm like, okay, I'm going to just smash this person.

Speaker 2:          00:19:57       But you know, sometimes I'll be watching the clock and when there's 40 seconds left I'll be like, all right, I'm going to try and submit this dude in the next 40 seconds or this is what I'm going against someone that's good. You know what I mean? I, that's, I honestly, I do that with you sometimes worry and you can feel me chilling and I'm all of a sudden I'm like, oh wait, there's only 30 seconds left and I have to go super hard to try and get you. And sometimes I don't give myself enough time and I said going to have to learn to get better. Yeah. And Yeah, me saying that, uh, agreed. I don't do that in training because what I heard, my lazy instinct is I always go just enough better than the person I'm going against to maintain and eventually finish them.

Speaker 2:          00:20:35       See, and that's good because you give the other guy good training and that's kind of the point with not, you don't want to, if you go and regularly Jitsu class and you're like, you know, upper belt mean like purple Brown, black belt and you go against a white belt, you get paired up with a white belt. I'm not saying necessarily to do that all the time because it's kind of, you kind of, it's a relationship you have with your training partners. So if I'm like, okay, every white belt I go against or have or any beginner, I'm just going to go as hard as again, it's like, Bro, what are you doing to the guy? Sure. Good thing. That's why for what you're saying for blue belts to do that is not good to have. Who else does that? White belts, they don't have the scale yet.

Speaker 2:          00:21:12       Green belt, Brown belt, black belt. That's going to be, that's going to be like, okay, I'm going to test my efficiency on making this happen really quickly. Blue Belt against the athletic white belt. It's going to be, it's going to be world war seven. True. And there's injuries that are waiting to happen was a purple belt generally is not going to get injured, not going to generally injure someone from being in a bad position. Blue Belt, white belt, maybe it hasn't. Bad scenarios. Yeah, and, and so really the point in doing that is like in a scenario like your situation where you don't have anyone to train with except for beginners that are all athletic and hungry. So it's like, okay, well what do I do? You know, you know what's cool too. He would come home from deployment better at Jujitsu. Then when I left for sure that happened on every appointment.

Speaker 2:          00:21:57       When I came home, I was better at Jujitsu then when I left, but not only better than I was, but I was in keeping with the standards of the guys that were training with Eh. So, you know, I'm rolling with Dean before I leave and I come back and I am now doing better than I was against Dean before I left where he's been here training the whole time. So that says to me that is an effective way to train. You know, you just, you just, and that, so that's why there's really no excuse. A lot of people ask, you know, what should I do? I live four hours away from the closest gym, man. Get some friends, put some mats on the ground, watching youtube and start training with each other. And occasionally when you get the chance, go somewhere to a school once a month, once every two weeks so you can learn.

Speaker 2:          00:22:39       Yeah. Yeah. And I think in your situation is kind of a, not necessarily unique, but kind of a specific type of situation where you have all the fundamentals essentially John. So you know, like habitual stuff, stuff that you're, you just automatically do with certain techniques, which is the, the correct technique, you know? So I think that you'll benefit more in that way where you can train with beginners. When I was a blue belt myself, yeah. I still got a lot better when I would be on deployment. Yeah. And when it was a purple belt when I was a brown belt, yeah, still still, it's just like a little, just a smaller version of that idea where if you're a beginner and you're like, okay, I've never taken you to do through, I'm gonna start on Youtube or whatever. I don't think you can benefit those situations.

Speaker 2:          00:23:25       Oh No, you can not as much. You can't. Yeah. You definitely not as much, but you can benefit. I can definitely benefit. You can definitely benefit. Yeah. It's better. It's a thousand times better than not doing anything and not trained. And if you've got one person that has that gift of being able to like understand what's happening, maybe you've got a wrestler in their burrow going to help you so much for me. You've got someone that did judo that's gonna help you so much. Yeah. But even if you don't, you just start looking at it and saying, okay, what's happening in this? What's happening right there? Okay. Try that on and walk on me. And you get some of those good youtube videos that really break things down. Well yeah, you can learn a lot. And I think you can, cause I didn't have to learn that way, luckily.

Speaker 2:          00:24:01       Luckily you got to train with the best guys in the whole entire world, you know? Hey, you know, to each their own and then idea actually. Yeah. Um, actually hotter Gracie, who's, you know, we not even arguably fucking top three, but all time ever, he, and he was actually telling me, he's like, I don't have like a team of world class guys to train with. He's like, sometimes they trained with Braulio sometimes cause he's in, he's in England. Yeah. So he has like, he's like, I only trained with my students and who are good and they give us some training but they're not, I don't have world class trading partners like my opponents do kind of thing and raising, yeah. So men to kind of teach their own, but all these things, yeah. Can Be beneficial even even if they don't necessarily seem like, you know what I think actually this is leading to is like you get what you make out of.

Speaker 2:          00:24:55       Right, exactly. Yeah. And there's, there's people in the UFC that have done the same thing that came from some random camp and they're training hard and they go and win the Connor Mcgregor. He didn't come from, he didn't come from Greg Jackson. Yeah. He didn't come from American top team. He came from, uh, you know, their school with, with Cavenaugh and obviously they're doing something right. But same thing. He didn't have the, the highest level guys to train against. He trained, I'm not saying slagging off their, their training partners, but it's not, it wasn't a known camp when he came around. Right, right. He, he's so, he's a guy like that. Uh, Max Holloway. He's out in Hawaii, right? He's training hard, but he's coming out here winning the UFC championship based on, you know, his training partners. So I think guys that, that actually understand what they need to do.

Speaker 2:          00:25:45       They do it, they get it done. They don't make any excuses. No excuses. You have at the end of the day, that's it. Right. Check. Next question. With life decisions, is it better to be decisive and take actions to move forward even if sometimes those decisions are wrong as opposed to being paralyzed by indecision and fear, thus getting maneuvered on by life? I ask this because I struggle with life decisions and have trouble committing to one path duty, eclectic interests. After listening to your podcast, I'm thinking it's better to be aggressive and maneuver on the battlefield of life as long as I'm prepared to adapt rather than sitting around and letting circumstance dictate my actions. Well, it sounds like you kind of answered his own question there, which is good. Yes, it is better to be aggressive. It's better to be decisive. This does not mean burning bridges. And I think we've talked about this before.

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       It doesn't mean that you just, you just say, I'm quitting my job right now because I'm going to go start a new life as a whatever your new job is going to be, right? I'm going to start a business selling widgets and I'm just going to go all in because I'm committed. Sure. Well, you, you know, how long has it takes to produce those widgets and what are, you know, so there's a lot of issues with that. You know, it's, there's a way though to, to mitigate risk on your decisions. And actually at the, uh, at the camp we were in, up in Maine, there was a lot of guys that were, you know, listen to the podcast and one of them really good, really good guy. He was talking to me about his business and the business, which I'm not going to go into any details, but he's basically saying, look, I've got this business.

Speaker 1:          00:27:29       It's going well. I want it to do better. And I'm kind of weighing this decision between bringing on, he says, no, I'm going to bring on like six people to really help expand and grow and all that stuff. He said, but if I do that and we have a couple rough, you know, if we hit some bad luck, I might be upside down and not be able to handle it. And what I really am scared of is like, that's not just me, but it's now it's my family. I got a wife and I got kids and now I'm hedging the comfort and safety of my family so I don't know what to do. And I said, okay, well do you have to go all in? Right? Do you have to turn around tomorrow and go, you know what? We're going all in. I'm going to hire these six people, we're going to expand.

Speaker 1:          00:28:15       And hopefully if everything goes right, we'll do really well. You don't have to do that. You don't have to put that much on the table. Instead I said, I said, well, how many people do you actually really need right now? And he said, probably one or two. And I was like, okay, why don't you bring all in one and and start to see where that goes and be prepared to look for another person to bring on to. And then as those two people work out and you're starting to fill their labor every day, and they're, they have work to do because you're expanding the cool, bring on three. And, and guess what? If you hit a hiccup and things start going sideways for whatever reason, that's cool. You don't have those additional four people or three people on board that you're paying payroll to every month, which is normally what kills businesses or one of the common things that kills businesses.

Speaker 1:          00:29:02       So it's the same. So, so that's, that's a good example, right? And he was, he thought to himself and he looked at me, said, absolutely, I'm going to go do that. And so he's probably back at his job right now, running his business and probably hiring a person to start expanding, not hiring six people and putting all of his chips on the table where it's a cool gamble. Let's say the percentage of winning winning is 70% you're like, yeah, I'm just going to do it. There's a 30% chance you lose and lose, and now your now your family has no house and no food. So that's not what we want to do. So why not just put some of your chips on the table and you can still win and make a little bit? You still, you still improve your position. So we got to do that with life too.

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       Like I said, you don't quit your job to start building widgets when you don't know what you're doing. You got to, why not just build the widgets in your spare time? I start putting those things on the internet, start seeing how they sell, start getting a little income from them, let them grow. And then finally, when you feel like the balance start to tip, maybe there'll be a last minute jump where you'd be like, okay, now I'm going to go for it. But what you're committing to is something solid, something tangible, and something that's making money, right? We're not jumping in and committing to something that's an unknown. We're going to commit some to something that's known and, and I think it's important to note that that right there is not a lack of commitment. And this is, you hear these like you know, people on the interwebs, there'll be like, you know why you have made yet?

Speaker 1:          00:30:26       Because you haven't 80 100% that's why you, if you want to do it, you got to commit with everything you've got. Well and so what people think is, okay, well I'm just gonna quit my job because I'm going to go for it but commit and then I'll be successful. Cause this guy over here told me if I committed, I'd be successful. It's actually not true. You can be 1000% committed to something and you can still fail. I got bad news for you. That's the reality. You know, that's the reality of do you think that people at blackberry weren't committed to their game? You know what I mean? You know, but what happened to blackberry? It's it's you. They were, they were committed but they made some bad decisions. And guess what? Now blackberry is not really in the game anymore. Well, they, I think they change games.

Speaker 1:          00:31:02       I'm not 100% sure, but people think that that because you didn't quit your job and go all in and put all your chips on the table. In fact, you're not committed. And I actually don't agree with that. And I'll get, here's my example if, okay. I think that commitment is actually harder to do when it's a long term commitment that you're going, okay, you know what, I'm gonna, I'm gonna stay at my job, but I'm gonna work three hours a day on this other thing. I'm going to be manufactured with maybe making my widgets three hours a day. And when I get home at 10 o'clock at night, I'm going to go until one o'clock in the morning making my widgets. That's commitment. It's actually smart commitment. It actually in some ways takes more commitment to do that than it does just to quit your job and say, I'm all in.

Speaker 1:          00:31:51       Because now you're holding, you're balancing all these different things you're carrying, you're shouldering more of a burden. So that actually takes more commitment. The problem is that people, they, they get weak. And after the fourth night of making widgets at 10 o'clock at night, they go, yeah, I'm gonna, I'm good. It's cool to have a job. I have a job. And so that's week. I, you know, an example would be what if you could get in excellent physical condition in three hours, but it was just like the hardest three hours that you could imagine thinking about that and your body would transform from whatever crap condition you're in right now into a specimen and it's going to take three hours of just, yeah. How many more people would be an amazing condition? I don't know. I think a ton more because committing for three hours to something, even if it was going to be super bad, people would be able to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:32:52       What takes more commitment and the reason everyone's not walking around like a perfect specimen is because it doesn't take three hours. It doesn't take three weeks. It doesn't take three months. It takes a daily grind that goes on for years that you have to hold the line on, on the way you eat, on the way you exercise on your life. And that takes real commitment. Yes. So it isn't a lack of commitment. It's planning. It isn't a lack of commitment. It is mitigating risk and don't confuse. Again, I think that the person that commits to something and still maintains this other income stream, for example, that person is at least as committed, if not more committed than the person says, you know what? Screw it. I'm going all in over here. I'm forgetting about, you know, quitting my job. But that's not a smart move and it takes more.

Speaker 1:          00:33:44       That's actually an easier, well, that's my point. It's easier in many ways to go, you know what? I'm quitting his day job. I'm quitting my nine to five. I'm sick of that cubicle. I'm sick of that construction site. I'm just going all in over here. That is an easier move. That takes less commitment than saying, I'm going to shoulder the burden of working 15 1820 hours a day for the next two years until I can get this thing stood up enough to where I can execute it. Yeah. Yes. It's almost like people were conflating the commitment. You know? It's like the almost people want to want to do a big show of commitment by quitting their job, but it's more of just a show of commitment. You're committed or you're not kind of thing. And then so a lot of times with these big shows of commitment comes just an immense amount of stupidity, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:34:34       Yeah, yeah. Meanwhile, you can either commit or don't commit, you know? Yeah, sure. If you don't quit your job and you make widgets and you don't commit, sure. It's like, all right, you got, you can facilitate your non commitment. Yeah. I dig here. Do your real job, your nine to five job as an enabler to you not committing. Yeah. Fully. Yeah. But by no means is that you know, no proof. Yeah. And it's important to note that don't confuse, and this is another mistake that people make mistakes on either ends of the spectrum. The other one is don't confuse planning and mitigating risk with not taking action, because that can happen to, you have to make things happen every single day. That's what you have to do. If you don't take action. If you don't move, which is what this guy's asking about, then yeah, you're paralyzed and you're never going to get anywhere. All you have to do is chip away at that thing. You got to make a little bit of movement every day. You want to write a book, and this is something I'm familiar with now, cause I'm writing books. I'm writing another book right now and you know what I gotta do? I gotta chip away at that thing every day, every day,

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       every day. There's your commitment, thousand words a day, 45 minutes, maybe an hour. That's what it takes. And guess what? If I can't give that hour for whatever reason, guess what? I'm going to get to 20 minutes. I'm going to get 30 minutes, I'm going to get something to get in there. I'm going to do work because I'm going to be close to my goal than it was. Yeah. That's the way it is. Yeah, man. And I think you got to see that live. Didn't your honor? It was my honor. That's, uh, but that's where it happens. Where else is it going to happen? Right. Yeah. We were flying back from Maine. I was, you know, echoes cruising. Good. Yeah. I think I fell asleep a couple of times. Yeah. You were kind of in and out, but I wasn't, I was hammering, I was, I was doing what I have to do because if I don't do it, then when's that?

Speaker 2:          00:36:26       When I'm going to get that hour. That was, that was four hours I had right there. Flight. Technically five. Yeah. Couldn't get my computer out for the first little bit. Oh yeah. They didn't let you, so whatever. All good. Yeah. It was kind of at time till it's peeking over your shoulder, like reading all, let's talk. Go. Right. And then they see a, what was it? I felt the named Kenny Williamson in there. Goes writing right now. Look to this good man composed. Yeah, I think that all that sounds like kind of obvious. You know, when you're saying it, I'm like, yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Got It. Or, you know, or at least the part where it's like, it's a daily thing. Like you got to have a progress, you know, like you got to take that step, you know, do, it sounds obvious, but man, how many times, and I didn't know this is like my friends and you know, whatever, uh, you go on, I don't know, online or whatever, and you see people complaining about, you know, stuff never happens for me.

Speaker 2:          00:37:24       You know, FML, FML means yes, stuff never happens to you. That's right. And stuff never happens for you. That's right. That is life doesn't happen for you in life. You got to go and make it. You know, I've explained to my kids, you want to make money, you have to take that money from someone else. You have to take it from them. Then people aren't just gonna walk up and give you money. Right. That doesn't happen. That's never happened to me in my life. No one has ever walked up and given me money. I mean, you got to take that money that they got to give it to you, that you've got to make them, you got to take it from them. Yeah. They want that money to, so what are you going to give them that's going to allow you to take it from him?

Speaker 2:          00:38:00       Yeah, that, that so yeah. Guess what? Nothing's, nothing happens for you. That's right. Nothing does happen for you. You have to make it happen. That's the default aggressive mindset that you are going to make things happen. I'm not gonna sit around and wait for things to happen and it's not going to happen. Yeah. It's not going to happen. Oh, well guess what? I read a story about this such and such a person and they just walked into this, you know, agency and they thought they looked did a really good job and now they're famous. Okay. That's great. Base your life on that percentage chance of happening. It's not happening. Yeah. I actually, I look at that and just think the match, the chances of anything like that happened to me or zero, nothing good is going to happen to me like that, that I'm just going to get a good deal.

Speaker 2:          00:38:42       Like that's not happening. Zero. Yeah, so if, if you're going to get it, you're going to have to make it happen. Yeah. Next question. You're saying that should be the red flag right there then. Right. Basically for the, for someone who's like nothing, you know, when am I going to get my big break or, or you know, nothing happens for me kind of thing. That should be the red flag, right? When it's like, yeah. Yeah. Seems you're talking about the fact that you're not, that things aren't coming to you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That should be a real big red flag. Nothing is going to come to you. Not Happening, not happening. You got to go and make things happen and once you have that attitude, I'll tell you what, it's a game changer. It's a game changer. Once you realize that that book that's so good, that's in your head, it's not going to write itself.

Speaker 2:          00:39:28       Once you realize that widget that you have, this plan for isn't going to build itself, then you'll realize like, okay, I'm going to have to make these things happen, and even then, guess what? You can make a widget that no one wants to buy and you can write a book that no one wants to know, wants to read, and if you're not okay with that, which is another thing that happens, people say, well, you know, no one will like it. Okay, well if that's what you think, well then don't even ride it unless you want to write it for yourself. Then write it for yourself and cool. Be be proud, be stoked to be happy. It's interesting. Let's say a book book, right? For example, this kind of reminds me of where you know how, let's say, I don't know me, I'm a, let's say, Oh, I'm a, I'm a pretty good writer.

Speaker 2:          00:40:08       In fact, I even wrote a book before, whatever. And then my friend on Instagram, Facebook, whatever, someone, my neighbor, whatever, they write a book and they, they release it and then they write another one and May, let's say, it's not even really that good, but it's out there. They're like, look at my new book. And you know, they got people support. Oh, that's awesome. You wrote a book and, and I'm meanwhile, I'm like kind of sour grapes a little bit. I'm like, should I am? I'm a better writer then in that person. Meanwhile, I didn't write any more. I'm over here. Yeah, I wrote back in the day, long time ago, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:40:42       But you know, I'm in it. I'm saying I'm in that arena, you know, and I'm kind of in my mind hating on this. There's people that hate on him that never even wrote a book in the first place. Yeah. Oh Man, I'm a better writer. I'm a better film guy. I'm a better writer, I'm a better fighter. Whatever. They had all kinds of people doing that. All kinds of people that will just be saying, Oh, you know, I, I, I was a better whatever. Fighter, Jujitsu player, a carpenter, a, whatever, you name it. Yeah. Meanwhile, taking no action software engineer. I could have done that. Why didn't you? Yeah, exactly right. I'll tell you why. Because you weren't committed. Yes. And the commitment that we're talking about, is it night. Yeah. At night or early, early in the morning or in the middle of the day, whatever it, how you said like, you're, you're not doing these enormous shows of commitment.

Speaker 2:          00:41:37       Like either you're committed or you're not, and if you're committed, it's going to show itself by your action. You know, allows people, again, back to the guy who's like hating on his neighbor doing quote unquote mediocre work. Like, oh, that's John, that's not that good hitting on it. You know what? This just made me think of this. Sometimes you'd meet a guy that was say, I'm going to seal training and, and they'd kind of be brag about it and you could see in their eyes that that right there was good enough for them. Oh be like, I'm going to seal seal team training. Yeah. No one had caused a seal team training, but that's the kind of person cause they just want to write. And you, I, I'd hear guy, you know, guys saying that, yeah, I'm going to seal training the guys that generally have a better chance or guys that, you know, you say, oh, what are you doing in the navy?

Speaker 2:          00:42:27       And they say, Oh, you know, I'm um, you know, just got done with a school and I'm starting, uh, hoping to go to seal training. You know, the, the, you have to pry it out of him. That guy's a better chance. The guy that's already bragging, basically indirectly bragging because he's implying that he's going to make it. Those guys going to have a little bit more of a rough five. Now this doesn't mean they're not, this doesn't mean don't be confident. Yeah. But that's what I'm saying is some people that are like, I'm going for it. They're happy with just saying, I'm committed. I quit my job and this is one way to do it. They're happy to let everyone know that. Yes. But what they're not happy to do is grind. That's what they're not happy to do. And that's where, that's where you, that's where you make your money, right.

Speaker 2:          00:43:09       Or where you make your goods are where you become successful. Yeah, there was, it is, it doesn't matter, but alluding to somebody and they were talking about, um, like commit, like people have goals. I want to be a singer or whatever. I want to be a CEO. I was wondering, I want to be a CEO or you can form an LLC today and you can be become the CEO. Exactly. Right. So that's kind of part of the point right there. It's like, okay, you want to be a feel because you see all this cool stuff on wherever, above being a CEO. But really what you're pursuing isn't necessarily being the it is, but what you're pursuing, where you're going to end up and where you're going to find success as a CEO, if you're pursuing that day to day of being a CEO, it's like, oh, I said this before and it's, it's on the surface, it's lame, but it's, it's actually really accurate. Like, if you want to be a gangster, you have to do gangster stuff every day. It's not just like posing with your guns. It's like you got to kind of, you gotta put in that work kind of thing, you know? So if you're going to be like, you can't just be Jocko and start a podcast and just in, in, you know, put out a book and that's it, and start collecting money. It's not like that you gotta you gotta go through to, you know, however old you are, many hears other steps involved.

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       Exactly right this day. And I used to joke about, uh, you know, cause when we started Ashkelon Front obviously, which is me and him, and we'd see some other guy out there to be a CEO of something and we'd be saying, well, that guy, a CEO of, and you look at their company and the company has them, the only one person or three people it, bro, you're on the CEO. Hey, I'm the CEO of Jocko podcast. The whole, it's just you and me. There's no CEO going on here. Yeah. We're cruising too hard. Yeah, yeah. That deal. You've got to focus on the right things as opposed to the wrong thing. Check.

Speaker 1:          00:45:17       Next question. Jocko. I coach high school football, which should I do with the star athlete who segregates himself and won't participate in hard drills or it won't participate hard in drills. Yeah. Now this one, I actually thankfully remembered that I said I would do this because when I got this, this is a Twitter question and I responded to this Twitter question in one word. So you know, he says, I got this guy, Star athlete, he won't participate in drills. What should I do with them? I responded in one word bench thought that so, so of course, you know, then people start saying, well you know it's, and, and I was like, yeah, I know. We're on Twitter, right? We're on Twitter. Uh, there's more to it than what's happening. I just answered 798 questions and this was 799 so I'm not going to go into full detail.

Speaker 1:          00:46:10       But then as people were kind of chime in and I was like, okay, I'll, I'll answer this on the podcast so we can go into it a little bit more. Because yes, your coach, your leader, and obviously I talk about this all the time, leadership is a nuance thing. It takes balance, it takes maneuvering, it takes chess playing, it takes mental, Jujitsu, it takes all those things, right? So the obvious answer of just like bench, that's my meat head answer. And fundamentally we'll get to it, but, and fundamentally that may be the result, but let's dive into it a little bit more. Who's The kid? What's his deal? What's his background? What's his attitude? Where's he coming from? What's his family like life? Or what's his family life like? What is, what's his past performance? What's his record? What year is he in school? I mean there's all kinds of things we need to know, right?

Speaker 1:          00:47:08       So now once we've sort of figured out what he liked now that any one of those things, any one of those variables is going to, is going to change our course of action a little bit. Because being a leader doesn't mean you get to follow a cookie cutter results or quick cookie cutter solutions to things, right? You're dealing with human beings and every single human being is different. And every single human being has a little to them that you cannot predict. So we're dealing with a kid. Guess what? A 16 year old boy, that kid is even more unpredictable and even more crazy than most, right? Cause he's got testosterone flowing through his system. He's chasing girls, he's, he's just going crazy. He's not secure with himself yet. He's got zits on his face. He's, you know, he's got things going on, he's got issues.

Speaker 1:          00:47:51       And so this kid is crazy and we're trying to deal with them. Now. Most kids can get, you know, they get through that and they're still participating in the team. This gets not, so one of the first things I always say this, you got somebody that's not stepping up into leadership position or they're not wandering. You put them in charge of it. Hmm. You know, you say, Hey, echo, I want you to run this drill. I think the way up, I'm watching you perform on the field, but I think you could really lead this drill. Well, I want you to lead this drill and show these guys what's up, right? Oh, so, so you know what I mean? Like you got a little fired up face on your, you're just there. So that might take his attitude. And now instead of me saying, Hey Echo, you've got to do this drill like everyone else.

Speaker 1:          00:48:26       I already know that you don't want to do that. So I'm elevating you a little bit and your ego, a little push, a little massage, and maybe you feel good about that now. And I say, Hey, you know, you can run this drill faster than anyone else. I want you to lead it. I want you to show them how to do it. I want you to make our team better. Boom. All of a sudden you're getting a little fired up. So that's, that's one solution type, right? I'm just getting kind of a broad solution types on. Another solution type is, is, and this is real easy, real easy, is when you're talking to someone that you want to improve their performance, you don't go to them and say, Hey, uh, you need to get better because you're just right now you're letting the whole team down, right? And you're just, you think you're all good. You think you're so good that you don't need to coach. You don't need to run drills with the team. You need to run drills to the team. Now your attitude is what are you talking about? So instead of saying that I, again, I'm going to eagle you up a little bit and be say, Hey

Speaker 1:          00:49:23       man, I'm going to talk to you. I've got to talk to you because I see so much potential with you, with your game. I see your athletic ability and I see the way that the other guys on the team look at you. You might not sense it. They look up to you.

Speaker 1:          00:49:38       You're a leader. Whether you want to be a leader or not. And the potential that you have in is as an athlete is not going to come to fruition on, unless you at least get some of your potential as a leader in line. So the reason I want you to run these drills isn't to make you better. I already know you're good. I already know you're good at the drills. The reason I want you to run these drills, Chi wants you to be even better. I want you to reach your potential. And by the way you help and run these drills is going to make the team better. And the better the team does, the better you're going to do. The more scouts we're going to here looking at you.

Speaker 1:          00:50:12       So there's that, and obviously I'm gonna explain to him why the drills are important for him and for the team and for AML and the team together for everyone to reach their potential. So those were, those are good too. And I guess overall, broadly what I'd be doing this whole time is talking to the person, talking to the individual, trying to figure out what his reasons were for not wanting to participate in the drills. And then countering those reasons with logical answers and you know, saying, Hey, here's why it's important and explaining it to them and then eventually you're going to get to a point where my coaching, my explaining, my maneuvering, my mental Jujitsu, none of it's worked and he's still telling me I'm not running the drills. I don't need to. Cool. Ben,

Speaker 3:          00:51:04       next question. You know what I mean? Well you played ball. What do you think? Yeah, cause I didn't play football. Yeah, no, that's exactly right. I would, I would think, and I'm trying to put myself in the mindset back when I was in high school, I remember going into my senior year, so you have, oh we had some kind of summer training, so it was really like high school summer training. That was for fall. Okay. Um, and that was like a camp situation, but no summer training, which was like after spring and stuff in it. And what they'd call it, they call it technique sessions. And all it was was like, you know, I played in high school was kind of like a slap back, which is a hybrid running back wide receiver type. And um, so the technique sessions were just kind of passing drills and you know, just hand stuff and maybe even some footwork.

Speaker 3:          00:51:51       But it was kind of fun. It was just, you know, the quarterback who was there and the receivers in the Ryan Beck catch passes, run routes and stuff and you know, for like, I dunno, 45 minutes, hour and um, so I remember going into my senior year and they're talking about, yeah, technique sessions this year, whatever, whatever. And I remember I was just talking to jade, my brother, and I was like, yeah, technique sessions. It's the kind where if you don't go, you don't get in big trouble or nothing. It's just strongly encouraged, you know, that kind of stuff. And I'm like, yeah, I'm not going to those kind of, cause that was real. I had done it with a man. I done well as a junior and I knew that now as a senior I'm really going to do well, whatever, whatever. That's, that was my little thought.

Speaker 3:          00:52:27       I don't need to go to those. So I was like, I was like, yeah, I'm not going into those with this kind of tone, that line. That's for people who are trying to train to get better. Me, I'm already dope kind of thing. You know? And Jay goes, he goes, oh yeah, like we're super sarcastic, like almost offended. He was like, Oh yeah, cause you don't need that, huh? And then he said, yeah, because you're just so much better than everyone. Actually I think he said both of those and I was like, Bro, it hit me really hard. I was like, Dang, he's right. Even if even if like, even if I really believe which it, it's dumb to believe that I won't benefit from that training. Even if it's like I'm just like, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm better than you. My whole team, by the way, the team sport, we all work together to win this stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:53:12       All you guys, I'm better than all you guys. Yeah. That's the feeling I had. He hit me real hard. I was like sure I didn't miss any of them. Now I'm, and I'm committed to. So there was that. Um, so in that, in that mindset, right. Going in, cause that's probably what it is. Yeah. It might be just that. And it makes sense like we're in your mind if you don't get it brought to your attention, like that's really what it is. I don't need to do these drills. I'm scoring touchdowns every single game. Why am I doing these drills that all these non touchdown scoring people are doing, you know, just put me in when it's time to score, touch that kind of an attitude, you know, that's probably what it is or making tackles or whatever the position is. I Dunno. Um, so just like how you said, make him kind of in charge of it, kind of like this guy, what's his name is Jim.

Speaker 3:          00:53:57       I know Jim, you know, take these guys and show them how it's done kind of thing in practice because practices, cause yeah, imagine, imagine if you say I'm not going to go to this thing. And the coach came up and he said, hey echo are you, you know, you missed your practices and you're like, yeah, you know. And he was like, hey man, I need you to set the example and really show these guys how it's done and you're not even showing up. Yeah. Even in mate me back in those days, if you would have left out that you didn't show up part, leave that part out. That would have compelled me way more. Like if you're like you man, you're, you're over here as a junior killing it and now it's about to be your senior year. You show you guys how it's done. I'd be like no.

Speaker 3:          00:54:37       Yeah. You know, cause it's like feeding the wheel kind of thing and boom out. Oh yeah. Big Time Sheet. Take charge in Pop Warner football, which is, you know, younger guys in I played for the Koloa Rams. Yeah. Sound ruthless. They are still are by the way. Um, and so my coach's name is coach Scovel and he had this kind of, it's kind of like a policy kind of the thing where when you do jumping jacks, when you do drills like, um, they call them gras drills, it's just like, oh, you do this stuff, you role, you do these things and while you do this in practice, and even before the game, when you're warming up, you yell as loud as you can. That's it. You yell a little kids just yelling, getting that stuff for his reasons. And it worked. Man. We're, we're good. And um, so what I would do is I would try to be the dude, like yell as loud as I possibly can to be the loudest guy during the entire, whatever you're doing, you're just yelling the entire time.

Speaker 3:          00:55:34       The drills. Yeah. When it's your turn, not, not if you're standing, you know, stand up in line. Got It. And then the front. Yeah. So the coach stands in front of three guys, three lines, and the guys in the front are doing the drills. So he holds the ball and you go, oh, and you just basically shuffle your feet. And he goes like that. Then you turn and then you come back and he goes this way, turn. And then he goes down. Then you basically sprawl, you know, boom, stand back a bit, you know, and then he goes, okay, like that. And then the three guys run. Now it's the next guys. You see what I'm saying? So, and when you're running, you gotta yell too. So that's been good. Cardiovascular work. Yeah. To be yelling, cause you can't bring as much. What it does is gets you in the habit of just going heart, heart, every play, you know? And when you're done, you don't have to yell. You're cruising your esteem, getting rid. And when one is go time, it's go time. And habitually. That's how it was man. It was, it really worked. And um, so anyway, when

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       I would yell is that in the coach would do this to a lot of kids when UDL super loud, you know, you can just see here that guy yelling above everybody would give that guy attention. Well, this guy who's getting a hot, yeah, look at this, it lose this guy and now the next guy, he's going to try to out yell that guy, go harder, go harder. So it's that same idea, you know, you give that guy props for working hard or showing everybody how it's done kind of thing. And it's like Ben, who's going to keep that shit up and everyone's going to want it. In fact, Jeff did me like that this week in training. So I go in and desks like, okay, after training is like everybody, you know, Glover, yeah, he um, you know, you do some pushups or like he'll make you do some pushups or whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:57:02       And I'm, he's like, okay, do the triangle drill. You know, when you're, you're on your back, you rock back, you do a triangle, you rock back again, go to triangle the other side. So, oh, all levels are in their beginnings as well. And I'm, so I'm doing it and he goes, oh, everybody in the middle of, he goes, stop, watch. I'll echo does it. And I'm like, if I didn't see what was going on here, I would feel really empowered to show it for now. And, and you know, so he successfully pulled that off as far as the feeling in my head. Two grown adult fitness. Were you doing them? Yeah, it was doing it with everybody when he pauses the whole class and said, watch how he does it, you know, so it's, it's the exact same concept up your game. A little bit technique should every bloody yeah, no, it's good man.

Speaker 2:          00:57:44       That works then like a, and the point there is even if you know that that's what they're doing to you, it's still kind of works. Hey, if you were the type of coach that had already had this happen before and like you just benched guy and the coach had the reputation that you don't play around this, what would have happened in the first place really? Would it? I agree. I think so. So you, you may have to set the example at some point. Yeah. The only drawback of that potentially is, um, you could cause in high school a lot of the times like you can have one or two guys on the team, sometimes even one guy on the team that'll dictate the outcome of the game where if this guy's playing, you'll, you'll probably win. If he's not, you'll probably lose and you, you have those dynamics in high school.

Speaker 2:          00:58:27       Um, so if you run that risk where, I mean, unless you, if you're looking at a bigger picture, well I guess this is a bad example. If the guy, if you, if you as a coach run things in a certain way where you, where you don't allow any slack. Yeah. Then the probability of this occurring is going to be less. Yeah. It can be done for sure. Like you know, it's a funny story. Life tell sometimes as we were doing desert training and long story short, there's a opportunity to have guys take a break and go to town and have some beer and get a good meal before the field training exercises start. And that's normal what everyone does. But we didn't do that. We didn't take a break, didn't go get food, didn't go get beers and nothing. We just got after it and I didn't really think much of it. But life was like, yeah, of course we wanted to go, but no one will. No one wanted to ask you cause it was just like, yeah, no slack, we're not,

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       obviously we're not, we're not here to train and get some, we're not here to, you know, go into town and drink a beer. No. And it's kind of funny looking back, but I think that that you can establish yourself as a type of leader that's just not going to allow like what are you talking about? You don't want to do the drills. But it starts with the little things like who knows what this, this kid, you know, maybe he didn't want to put on his practice Jersey and he wanted to wear this. You know what I mean? Just like little things, little things build up. And eventually he seemed just like a normal kid, just like a five year old that pushes the envelope with everything. Can't get worry about, well, what can I get away? Can I get away with that and what can I get away with? People like to push the envelope right on my life, man. Yeah, no Slattery. Yeah, but you can go too far with no slack of course, and you now, now everyone hates you as a coach because you just don't understand. You don't listen and you're a jerk. You've, you've gone too far in one direction or you've gone too far in the other direction. Balanced dichotomy. A leadership. Get some. Yeah. That's true.

Speaker 1:          01:00:21       Next question, Jocko. Have you ever had a person you couldn't get through to someone that you couldn't manipulate? Then what? What do you do when you can't get through? Well, yeah, of course. I've had people that I could not get through to and generally speaking, these people are like level 12 arrogance. That's what they are. Giant ego. That's what causes this. There was quite a few seal leaders that I dealt with. I shouldn't say quite a few. There were several seal leaders that I dealt with that were like that and have several business leaders that I've dealt with that were like that. In podcast number five, I read that counseling letter, corrective measures to a guy that was really arrogant. And despite that letter, he did not change and he got fired. So what do you do when you've got someone that you can't get through to you?

Speaker 1:          01:01:17       You fire them if they are, if, and here's what you gotta do is what, what makes that tricky is that some people, and this May this, this make people freak out. There's some people that there's such good performers that even though they're slightly negative on maybe their team participation, but they're so good that, that it offsets their negativity, right? And that happens. It happens. You know what happens with saint salespeople, salespeople are, are in order to be in a sales position, you've got to be confident. You gotta be aggressive. You've got to be somewhat arrogant, right? You gotta believe in yourself. And so some salespeople take that to the extreme where they're just like, I don't need to listen to what you're telling me. The new procedures are, screw that. I'm the one that's doing the big dollars over here. How much you follow my procedures boys, right?

Speaker 1:          01:02:06       So, so that happens. Well then what you gotta do is you've got to look does is this guy producing so now that can create problems within the team and you have to balance those things. Is this guy, uh, is the negativity, is creating offset by the awesome productivity Vinnie's doing. And furthermore, if the guys that good, hey, maybe we should be modeling some things after them. I got no problem with that. If you're the best performer, cool, I want to imitate you. I want to get my people to imitate you. So that happens at the other place where you might see it. A similar situation is a leader that does really good with their relationships down the chain of command, for instance, but really has bad relations up the chain of command. So again, you've got to ask yourself, okay, if I fire this leader, how many of these people that he has great relationships are now going to leave? And what kind of detriment is that to the team?

Speaker 1:          01:03:00       That can also happen with someone that's doesn't debt treats their people like crap, but up the chain of command, everyone thinks it's great and, and he's getting the mission done by the way, right? He's a slave driver and he's creating total animosity between him and his team, but he's accomplishing the mission. So now what you do, there's risk. Everyone could quit. There's rescue, good fireman. Now you don't accomplish the mission anymore. This is why leadership is hard. And this is why you have to balance everything. You have to balance those things. But talked about it a bunch of times. If you get someone, you're coaching them, you mentor them, you do everything you can, you have flank them, you do Jujitsu, mental Jujitsu on them. You try and get them squared away. And eventually if you can't, you weigh against, you know, how it's gonna affect the situation. And then in many cases, you've got to let them go. And we fired, you know, we fired five, saw plenty of seals, get fired from leadership positions. Um, and, and same thing with, you know, obviously you work with consulting businesses. We see all kinds of people getting fired because they're either not capable of doing their job, they're too arrogant and they don't recognize that things are going sideways and they're just thinking that they're doing everything perfectly. No, that's not gonna work out well for you.

Speaker 1:          01:04:17       You know, what did I think it was Lafe did, uh, someone asked him, uh, you know, when do you know, when's that line where it's like, when it's time to fire someone. And he was like, in a nutshell, there's a lot to it, but in a nutshell, which I thought was dope. Um, he said it's, you know, you're at that point where you, where you fire someone when, um, when you don't feel bad about it, right? So it's like, yeah, you, you every tried everything. And, and there's also people boots, there's some validity to this that say the first time you think you should fire someone, you should fire him. That's the other end of the spectrum. Right? And what that means is when you're looking at someone and you're going, man, okay, I can save them, I can help them. That's the kind of advice you give to someone that's, that's a, that's got a maternal instinct, right? That you meet someone, Hey, I know what this guy is just a good guy and everyone on my team is great and everyone's going to do great job. You can't tell that person what Lafe and normally tell people, which

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       is when you feel good about it, you should fire him because that person will never feel good about firing anybody just to see what I'm saying. Cause he just said, dude, this guy, I know he's going to make it. It. No, he's going to come around, you know I, and then they, then they start playing the, the extreme ownership game, which is, you know, if I would've given echo a better direction, he would have been able to do this. It's my fault. I've given an echo 17 re iterations of this and he still didn't complete it correctly. He's fired. That's the way it works, right? There's, yeah. So balance. So that spectrum of, of, you know, being within the confines of being justified, firing somebody, a certain type of person, you got to say when you don't feel bad about it. Right, right. I mean, that's like a fire heavy type dude.

Speaker 2:          01:06:00       Right. But there's also someone, the reason that you shouldn't feel bad about it is because I've done everything I can do to help you, which takes work. It takes effort, it takes tact. It takes hard conversations because it's hard for me to go and say Echo. You know, I've been, I've been looking at your videos lately and they're, they're not really what we're looking for, right. I don't want to say that to you. And you know, I, it's uncomfortable and we're kind of like, you know, we, we, we want to get along. So instead I'm like, yeah, I call that the video was good, man. Yeah, it's good, but I'm not telling you the truth. And then over time our videos are looking good enough. And eventually I said, you know what? You know we're not, no one's buying our videos anymore and we haven't gotten a new contracts.

Speaker 2:          01:06:40       So guess what? I'm going to have to let you go. And you're like, what you're talking about? You said, all the videos I made were good. Now you're firing me. Maybe you need to be able to become a better salesperson. Right? Whereas if I had the hard conversation early and said, hey, [inaudible], you know, I know you're creative and I appreciate that, but we also need to get the message across for our clients. Obviously fabricating a business where we're making videos for clients, which I know we don't really do a lot of anymore. Occasionally you do it, but yeah, you got to, you got to have the harder conversations earlier. If I'm the type of person that doesn't like to have the hard conversations, once again, I never feel good about it because I never, I never gave you any advice. So it always feels bad for me to fire someone.

Speaker 2:          01:07:27       But if you're following good leadership tactics, then absolutely true. When you get to a point where you've got to fire somebody, you won't feel bad about it. Cause you know you've done everything you can, you know, you've coached them, mentor them, and you know that if you keep them on board, you are negatively impacting your team, which is bad. Yeah. And then go down to the other side of the spectrum still within the confines of being justified in firing somebody, by the way. But on the other side of the spectrum, you get how you say that, what do you call it? The maternal instinct versus instinct. The person who can, like, they're just super hard on themselves maybe. Or they're, you know, like even if you did do everything you can and you still like, I could have done more, you know, it's my fault, not his, I feel like I let them down as a leader and it gave them 17 counseling. Chits, they don't belong here. They can't do their job. Stop. Yeah. I mean while they're going home

Speaker 3:          01:08:15       laughing at you or whatever. But yeah, you get that kind of personality. So it's kind of like how you said you got to balance it. You gotta be like, okay, you've got to recognize, okay, what kind of person am I, you know? Or what kind of person is this other person kind of thing. And if they're those maternal instinct jewel for lack of a better way of putting it person, then what was it the first time you feel like you should fire him, you should fire him. You, you hang out on that side of the spectrum. You got it. Yeah. How do you regain respect from your employees after you've come across as too nice? My husband and I are business owners with 45 employees in a small software firm. Since adding more employees in the last 18 months, the culture is changing. I blame are easy going attitude. Increasingly there is an attitude problem where negative push back has become almost a daily occurrence. How do we lead our way out of this?

Speaker 1:          01:09:16       Okay, well this is a rough one. I'm not, by no means I shouldn't have even said it's a rough one. It's, it's a challenge, right? You have to hit the reset button for sure, and you got to let people know that things are changing. Now I would straight up have a meeting that you, you sit everyone down and say, hey, here's what's happening. We are growing and as we grow we are going to have to evolve just like a person. As you get older, you have to evolve. You have to become more mature, and here's some of the things that we're going to have to tighten up, right? Is instead of, you know, everyone's just, hey, if you come in and you want to go, you got to, you know it's your kid's birthday. Oh yeah, no problem. Day Off, you say, look, that's not happening anymore. We will do our best to let you out for your daughter's birthday. We will do our best to let you go. Take care of family members when they're sick. We will do our best to give you bonuses that you've become accustomed to. We will do our best to give you raises annually. We will do our best to continue to take care of you, but none of those things are guaranteed

Speaker 4:          01:10:34       at all.

Speaker 1:          01:10:38       We are trying to be profitable. In fact, we have to be profitable in order to continue as a business on top of being profitable. In order to grow, we have to reinvest in the company. We have to take the money that we make and we have to put it back into this company in order to grow and we are going to grow. That is our goal and in order to grow, we are going to have to put procedures and standards in place now that will allow us to maintain some control and efficiency as we grow. If we don't do that, we're going to fall apart. So that is what we need to do. Now why do we want to grow? The reason we want to grow is because we want to be bigger. We want to create more opportunity for everyone sitting in this room. We're not trying to grow for us. We're trying to grow for everyone. The more opportunity everyone has to advance in leadership up to make more money. That is what we're trying to do. But we can only do that if we, as we grow, we evolve and become better and become more efficient and become more standardized in the next 18 to 24 months. That is what we have to do as a company.

Speaker 1:          01:11:55       So I would have a meeting and say something like that. Something along those lines. Lay down the law a little bit now also then you have to change your attitude. You have to somewhat change your attitude because you are mister nice guy. That's how you ended up in this position. You know, the husband and wife team, Mister, Mister and Missus, nice guy. You can and should be nice as a leader. I understand that. But at this point the team meets to get tightened up and so you're going to have to impose some discipline on them

Speaker 1:          01:12:29       in order for there to be freedom in the future. Uh, surprisingly. Right. But we know that now. I had a friend who was a platoon commander and he was, he worked with me and I knew him. And when he was a platoon commander, he was a real nice guy, super nice guy. When he was a platoon commander, he was a nice guy, super nice guy. Things didn't work out good for him because I don't know that, I don't, I don't specifically know what happened, but I know that things didn't go great. And when he talked to me about it, because the thing is, when I worked with them, we were all bros and I was young enlisted guy, but he, we know we all bros, but we all had that level of respect. Hey, you know what? We can go out and have a beer tonight.

Speaker 1:          01:13:12       But tomorrow morning when we get to work, I'm, I'm in the game and I'm, you know, I'm, I'm towing the line and that's pretty much what we were all like all of us, unless the guys working with this guy and when he got to this new place, new command, all of a sudden it wasn't like that anymore. And he was broing out with people and when you get back into work, they wanted to bro out at work and it was like, well, we don't need to listen to you. We were having beers with you last night and that's what he told me. He said, you know, I, I was too nice of a guy and I didn't get the respect that I needed to be able to effectively run the platoon and it was not good. And he said something to me too, which I guess I instinctively knew or maybe I didn't, but it stuck with me.

Speaker 1:          01:14:00       You know, it's real easy to give more slack to someone when you have them on a tight leash. Right. It's real easy. It's hard to do. The other thing, it's hard to, well, listen to this, when I have you on a tight leash and I give you a little bit slack, you're happy. You're like, oh look at Jocko. He trusts me. He's letting me go a little bit when I give you all kinds of all kinds of slack and all of a sudden I have to tighten it up. I start pulling on the leash. Well guess what? It chokes your neck. It jokes. You start bringing in them. And the further I got to pull you back on Ian, the longer you're choking for. And so by the time you get back to me, you're ready to bite. And so that's what you have to do.

Speaker 1:          01:14:39       You don't walk in and put the dogs out and let them run wild on to the end of the leash and let them run wherever they want and then try and pull them back in. Because when you let them go, by the way, you're thinking yourself. Well and you know this is a good dog. And so when I let them run around and he's not going to do anything wrong, he's going to be a perfect same when there's a chance that that's going to happen. And there's a chance that that's a good dog and you let them run around. And when you say come back, he comes back to you. There's also a chance that he's not a good dog. And when he gets out there, he starts running and started biting. People are running into the road or doing whatever bad dogs do. And so what?

Speaker 1:          01:15:11       What are you gonna have to do? That dog is you've got to pull them back to you and it's, it's actually worse because we already know this is a bad dog so that when you pull him back, he's pissed and he's going to bite you. Whereas a good dog wasn't doing anything bad the first place. And when you pull them back in, he looks at you and goes, Hey, I must have gone to out of control. I'm sorry I'm back in line now. You see what I'm saying? There's the, the way the whole thing unfolds is bad because the bad dog, he's a bad dog and he's doing bad stuff. When you give him slack on the leash and when you pull them back, he's going to snap at you, the good dog. You give them all kinds of room on leash. She's not doing anything good.

Speaker 1:          01:15:46       And when you pull them back, he goes, he goes, oh, sorry, I didn't realize I was doing something out of line master. Sure. I'll, I'll keep it in check now. And you can give me more slack if you want or not. Doesn't matter. I want to be, I want you to trust me. Meanwhile the bad dog, he's just like Groundling is pissed. So that's going to be a hard one. I'm not, and like I said, it's not impossible, but the big thing you've got to do, I think in this situation you gotta be clear. Here's what's going on. You could even potentially, I don't know how well you are of a speaker interacting with people. You could even say something along the lines of, you know, hey look, we've been running this real loose and I've been real, you know, we've been doing everything we could to, to run this as loose as possible, but we got to tighten it up.

Speaker 1:          01:16:33       I think that's the, I think you could say that cause you don't want to say, look, I've been being nice and I can't be nice anymore that, that, that comes across wrong. But to say, look, we've been running in real loose here and we've been trying to give you guys as much freedom as we can and we still want you guys to have freedom, but we've got to put some parameters in place that are gonna, that are gonna allow us to run this bitch business efficiently as we grow and as we scale. You can quote me on that one, but yeah, makes sense. When you see him be clear and consistent, you know, like, oh, um, you know, some people they'll implement rules and I'm speaking from an employee standpoint

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       where I'm looking at the boss when they're trying to put in new rules to tighten it up so to speak. Cause in the night club industry that tends to happen, you know, managers broing out with, I like to term bro out, by the way. You never heard that if you never heard that before? I don't think so. Not that I can remember, but it's interesting. I thought that was pretty common vernacular, especially amongst a bro like yourself, bro out broken out with them. Um, yeah. And the nightclub managers tend to bro out with people or you know, bro out with girls or whatever, the waitresses, whatever, whatever. I don't know if you can bro out with girls. I know that's all I have to go over it. Probably a different word for it, a group of words, whatever. Um, but nonetheless, that tends to happen. So, you know, some that sense, same situation, you know, you get nightclubs in disarray as a business, you know, then they got to tighten it up and apply more rules and now you got to, you know, whatever with the clock ins, it's like just a little rules and negative attitude though.

Speaker 3:          01:18:10       All these rallies, these damn rules. Yeah, Bro, I'm a late person. So the whole clock in thing. Anyway, long story, but I'm so anti echoes.

Speaker 3:          01:18:20       So when the manager would implement the rules, but they don't follow the rules, you know, it's men. It, they just won't take and people get more mad. But when you see there was this man and he died too. Unfortunately. Joel, he was, um, he was, he was our boss for, for awhile and he, uh, he had to kind of do that, like implement new rules, but this was the guy he would bro out with you. But like it was weird, he did this weird kind of balance where he would break some rules but then he'd follow rules. But the rules that he broke, he wouldn't care if you broke them kind of thing. These are all small, teeny tiny goals by the way. Um, but he was a real consistent person, you know, where if he wanted something done, we were all doing it, including him, you know.

Speaker 3:          01:19:05       And I remember thinking, man, this, I really liked this guy in that way as well where he's telling us to do stuff, but he won't like, cause there's other managers at all, man, I can go into it. And then where there's other managers and they were straight up. Like I'm the manager here. It just needs to be nimble and worships me. And it's a weird dynamic in nightclubs anyway. And they wouldn't follow the rules at all, you know, but you had to cause you're the employee, you know, kind of thing. But yeah, when you're a manager, and again from an employee standpoint and, and I see my boss following the new rules consistently. Yeah. It's so much easier to sign on and it's Kinda like, okay, that's what we're doing. I dig it. And yeah, if you combine it with like what you said, being clear, well I'm down, I'm down for the change. I get it, man. I get it. Oh yeah. Next question. Jocko. No bad teams, only bad leaders and always the same relationship with each boss. Yet you also staged a mutiny. How do you reconcile that? Okay, so what he's talking about, obviously no bad teams, no bad

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       leaders is from extreme ownership. And it's actually from before that Napoleon said the same thing. Hackworth said the same thing. We changed the words a little bit. But so that's, and then the other thing he's talking about is that I always say, or I have the same relationship with every boss I've ever had, whether they were stupid or smart or whether they were aggressive or passive, whether they were big ego or humble. I always had the same relationship with all of them. That is, they trusted me and they gave me what I need you to do my job. So how do I reconcile the then, then he's talking about stage to mutiny because we had a kind of a mutiny in one of my platoons, conductor when I was a young enlisted guy. And so how can you do that? Right? If I had all these great relationships with all my bosses, but I staged a mutiny.

Speaker 1:          01:20:56       Interestingly, I actually had a decent relationship with a guy that I staged a mutiny with. Now that I think about it. So to go back to the earlier question, what I'm talking about being a renegade and you know, being a rebel and, and like I said, you, you have to rebel when it is necessary. So, and also for the mutiny that is in question. I need to make it clear here. I didn't stage the mutiny, it wasn't me. It was kind of a group effort that was somewhat led by the leadership of our, the enlisted leadership of our platoon. And it was a movement that I certainly supported and was on board with and we were kind of the e five mafia in that platoon. Sure. Yeah. So we were kind of had the voice of the people write me in a certain group of guys actually from my buds class who are, we're all kind of yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:21:45       Kind of just fired up about things. And uh, you know, I, it wasn't like, the thing is, it wasn't like the platoon commander had a couple of weaknesses. Right. And maybe he wasn't the best of tactics or maybe it wasn't that, you know, he wasn't the best shot or anything like wasn't the best athlete. No, he was a good athlete. He tactically, he was like marginal. Um, but what, he didn't have talk about this all the time. What, he didn't have his, he didn't have any humility at all. And so he wasn't listening to anyone that was giving him any input, including he had very experienced senior enlisted advisors. So the platoon chief and the platoon Lpo were awesome guys, very respected seals. One of them had been in the first Gulf War on the ground getting after it as much as he could. So these guys were experienced on the senior chief was a really, really smart guy and this guy wasn't listening to. And so you had somebody in the situation was, they would have been bad for the platoon to have this type of leader in there. And now think about this, if it's bad for the platoon, that it's bad for your mission.

Speaker 4:          01:23:01       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:23:02       If you don't have a good platoon, you can't execute mission well. And that's the bottom line to this question. That is how I reconcile this. How does this situation affect the mission affect our ability to accomplish the mission? How does it do it? If we have a bad leader and it makes us a bad platoon, then we're not going to be able to accomplish our mission. And therefore I need to help get rid of this person. Because my number one thing that I'm trying to do is be good at my mission.

Speaker 5:          01:23:34       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:23:36       And obviously a more unified team is going to accomplish the mission more effectively and more efficiently, period. So that you know what? That is why it is so important for people to understand the mission and the goal and the commander's intent. Because all we've, your decisions are based on and guided by that understanding of understanding of what the mission is.

Speaker 5:          01:24:05       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:24:08       So you need to put the mission first all the time to make the right decision. Now, as soon as I say that, what pops into your head? Oh, Jocko, you care about the mission more than you care about your men. Not True. Because think about this. If you are executing your mission effectively, you are taking care of your men. That's in the business world and it's in the battlefield because in the business world, if I'm executing my, my mission effectively, guess what we're doing? We're making more money, be more profitable, we're gaining more clients, we're growing and therefore I'm taking care of my employees because I'm keeping them employed and making them more bonuses and making them more money and, and offering them more leadership opportunities in combat. Same thing. If we are good and I execute my mission effectively, guess what? We've mitigated risk. The, the, the in the best possible way. The more we mitigate risk, the more people are alive, the blessed casualties we take. So if I'm doing everything geared towards the mission, then then I am taking care of my men. Cause by the way, if I'm running a mission with heavy casualties, what about my next mission?

Speaker 1:          01:25:28       Right? So if you're my boss and you tell me to charge this machine gun nest with my guys and I say, boss, you know we shouldn't do that right now. You, you, you carry out the mission. Okay, well who's going to do the next mission? Right? There's not unlimited guys here, so you can't do it. You can't run a mission after you've taken heavy casualties. Just like you can't. If you as a businessperson, if you expend all of your capital on one project, well guess what? You can't do the next project. So good job. You accomplish the one mission, but you can't accomplish anymore on the, if you incur a bunch of casualties for one mission, you can't accomplish anymore. So in both those cases, the more effectively you, you handle the mission, not just the one mission, but your broad mission, your strategic mission, the better you do that, the better you are taking care of your men and the better you are taking care of your people in the business world. So and on top of that,

Speaker 5:          01:26:29       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:26:30       on top of that, 99% of the time your mission is aligned with the best thing for your people. That's what I'm saying, 99% of the time, if we make more money as a company, it helps all my people. If we, if we accomplish missions in the most effective and efficient and take the lease casualties, that's the best thing for my people. So,

Speaker 5:          01:26:53       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:26:53       back to the question, how do I reconcile these things? I look at how I can best accomplish the mission and if at best accomplish the mission to rebel against what's happening. There's some cases where I might not, you might be my boss and I might not like you, but you've got a great relationship with the army commander and we're working in their battle space.

Speaker 5:          01:27:11       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:27:13       Would it make sense for me to throw a mutiny and get you fired? No. It would make no sense whatsoever. It's going to be better for our mission. If I say echo socks, but I'm going to listen to them and we're going to massage this thing and would make things work because he has such a good relationship with this army commander that he, he's making things happen.

Speaker 5:          01:27:30       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:27:31       So I might not do it. I might not stage emit a mutiny. Not based on the fact that you, that your level of sucking but based on the fact that what's more important to me is that we accomplish our mission and if you have a good relationship with the army commander, I'm going to keep you around. If you were, if you were in a business situation and you had, you were not doing a good job and you're one of my subordinates, you're not doing a good job, but you have these great relationships with all these clients and we're accomplishing our mission well because you've built these great relationships. Am I just going to fire you because I think you're doing a fix. I think you're a crappy leader of your men. No, actually I'm not. What is best for the mission now I might have to secondary and tertiary plans to move you into position where you don't have to handle the operational things that you suck at.

Speaker 1:          01:28:20       And I might put you in a position where you've just going to become, you know, a business debt, a Biz Dev guy where you're out there meeting and greeting people cause that's what you're good at. I might make that happen, but I'm not just going to go echo was a bad leader. Fire Him. Throw away the the skill that you do have. And now we're not accomplishing our mission or cause I ruined all the relationships. Cause now you go to all these, all these other partners that we have and you're going to, yeah, Jocko fired me. He's pathetic. He goes, it realize what we're doing here. I'm going over to this company. Come with me. Bring Your Business over here with me. So you reconcile it by looking at the mission. And the mission is almost always aligned with taking care of your people and taking care of your people in the sense of imposing discipline or not imposing discipline is being disciplined and making them work and giving them, training them hard, pushing them.

Speaker 1:          01:29:12       That is generally what taking care of your people is taking care of your people. Is it? Hey, you know what? Echo, ah, you know, uh, don't worry about that video that you owe to the client. I know you, I know what your daughter's birthday. You go ahead and go home for the day. Am I taking care of you? If I do that, they'll say, am I taking care of you? No, I'm not. I'm actually hurting you because now we got a bad reputation. We delivered the video late. The company passes word to the next company. It says, Hey, you know those guys are there. Video is okay, but it doesn't matter because it was late. Hmm. Now that's the reputation we have now. Fast forward six months, we're downsizing. I don't need you anymore. I'm going to make the, you know, I don't need for video makers, I only need one and you're not the one. You see what I'm saying? So I'm not taking care of my people. If I focus on the mission, which is, hey, echo, I apologize. I know what your daughter's birthday, but guess what? We owe this video. We got to get it done and you got to get in here and make it happen. Am I taking care of you then? Yes, I am. I know it doesn't feel that way, but yes, I am.

Speaker 4:          01:30:12       Yeah. Yeah. I did.

Speaker 3:          01:30:18       Making sure they're equipped, capable and

Speaker 4:          01:30:23       treated fairly. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:30:28       I said impose discipline on them. Yeah. And like that doesn't work.

Speaker 4:          01:30:32       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:30:35       But what you have to do is you have to impose this point. There's the dichotomy. Yeah. Cause you don't want to say echo. You will come in and make this video. I'm imposing Sonia. I'd be like, Echo, we owe this video. We said we're going to turn it in and let me tell you the ramifications if we don't do this. Here's what's going to hurt. It's going to hurt this, this, this, this, and this. Going to eventually could end up with you not having a job and me not having a business. Yeah. Do you like the sounds of that? No. You don't.

Speaker 4:          01:31:01       No.

Speaker 3:          01:31:03       You might be the wrong guy to ask about this and maybe you're not. I don't know. But what do you think? So you mentioned missing your daughter. My daughter's birthday. I didn't miss my daughter's birthday by the way. Um, did you say you did or did not? Did Not, but my son just had a first birthday. I did miss that, but it's his first birthday cakes. So I've always thought this was before I had any kids with any birthdays that the first birthday, that's where the parents and stuff for the king, you know, he doesn't remember the first year, his first birthday. He never,

Speaker 1:          01:31:32       no, I'm definitely going to be the wrong person. No, keep going.

Speaker 3:          01:31:36       Oh boy. So missing birthdays, is that like a bell curve? Like okay, one first birthday, age one, you king sort of miss that age zero. You can't really miss that. Yeah. Meaning when they're born, go go, go talk to the military people in there. I know, I know, I know. Yeah, no, you're right. And I'm saying if you have the options and you know, we're speaking in terms of okay,

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       if you're, I mean you sort of have a, like in terms of, you know, we're that this company, you're my boss on the video maker. Hey Echo, you know, we've got to get this video done. Whatever. I don't know. That may, maybe even in an extreme case, but I'm saying in a general sense, which birthdays are more expendable, that's ultimately the question. And it doesn't necessarily mean in this specific, I'm gonna tell you right now, as a guy that was in the military for 20 years, the birthday, if you're there, it's a luxury. If you're there for Christmas, it's a luxury. If you're there for thanksgiving, it's a luxury. I missed all kinds of that stuff all over the place. Just like a big Joe, you big, you know, you're just not going to be there. Okay. So now we're not in the military. No.

Speaker 2:          01:32:45       And it's less about missing him or not. Okay. So at the end of the day, no matter what birthday, even right now, you're thinking if you miss them, no. Huge deal. No, I mean if I actually thought it was a huge deal, I would have to choose an entirely different lifestyle and life. Right, right. And I'll tell you what, my kids, no. Yeah, yeah. Okay. They've always known. Well, okay, so guess what? Someone's out there getting after his name, his name to my dad. No, no, no. Okay. Okay. He missed another birthday. Don't care. I get you yet. No, you're, I dig it and, but that's kind of in a way, I mean, not to be too specific and split hairs, but I'm going to do it anyway. I mean, not even necessarily you and your specific situation. The most important for exactly around the spectrum of ages five through 11 five through 11 are have the most weight, most weight.

Speaker 2:          01:33:41       Okay, so not zero, not when they're born. Nope. So if you, if you miss the birth of your child because you had to work. And I'm not saying military, I'm saying because you were trying to finish some report or something or whatever or you're trying to be there. Okay. So, but comparatively speaking, the, the birth of your child compared to the fifth birthday, you say fifth birthday is more important because they don't remember anything from zero to four. It's just a big blue. Dang. That's a good point. And it's just nothing happening. All, it sounds like those parents that you're taking your kids, and I did this too. I actually, I didn't, I did it with my first kids. My wife's like, we're going to go to take the girls to Disneyland and that's it. Oh, okay. Walking around at Disneyland, which is pretty close to a living hell to pay. Actually standing in lines in the Anaheim summertime, like just baking and yet here's the deal. The girls are just so excited the whole time and so happy and me. No. So now I don't, I haven't been to any of those things in a long time. Um, actually I went with a business group and walked around Disneyland, Disney world and I was

Speaker 1:          01:34:57       like, you've gotta a killer now, but this is the thing. The kids don't remember it. You can show them pictures and they go, oh, that's cool. You can stage those pictures like oh nine landings. Like just set them up and be like, oh yeah, Cinderella, whatever. We seem to be four or five. Yeah, five years. Okay. Actually men. That's a good point because when I say now, I'm sure there's developmental things happening. When there, when you do things, when you participate in activities with your kids, obviously zero to five but you know, you could probably, it probably be more developmentally helpful for you to spend a day with them, you know, coaching them and in Jujitsu or coaching them and boxing or coaching them and Moitai or coaching them and shooting or coaching them in archery or coaching them and go hunting small animals or coaching them in how to do combat trauma care.

Speaker 1:          01:35:49       Just like general failure four year old. Yeah, you're right. You're right. Um, yeah, yeah. That's as opposed to hey, you're going to Disneyland. Look at, yeah, that's another good question is like the birthday thing. So, so, so cause the only, cause you mentioned because by 11 they don't care anymore. By 11 they don't care. Oh well my kids were, were all like, oh my birthday, don't care. Yeah. So man, that's a good place. We have a rule. You get to pick your word, you go out for dinner on your birthday night. And in the last like five birthdays, we haven't even been able to pull that off successfully. Yeah. So obviously it's going to be what, what the group is used to. But as far as the kid in you missing the birthday for, you know, for the cow was a kid. You know what I used to pick, cause I that used to be in my family too.

Speaker 1:          01:36:29       We get to like pick dinner. You notice to pick. Yeah. Chicken patties. Chicken for dinner. Oh, just from the floor store. Just get some chicken patties. I used to love those things. Dang. Yeah. I remember in school I went to Koloa elementary school. I used to love the chicken patties. They're, yeah, they're dope. The chicken patties or you sound like chicken mcnugget local. Big Flat Chicken. Mcnuggets yeah. And I didn't even like, I didn't like steak until I was in the, because, because we didn't have a lot of state grown up because steak is expensive. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. Especially that Ribeye. Yeah. Especially that Revi. So we didn't have steak, we had chicken patties tasted good to me. Pretty Dope. And sometimes you know what else? Of course you want Mcdonald's when you're seven. Sure anyone's codes. Get some fries and a shamrock shake shack.

Speaker 1:          01:37:13       I had told, cause you know I love mint chocolate chip, right? So I had told all my kids about the, the original mint chocolate chip milkshake was the shamrock shake it Mcdonald's back in a dairy, which they'd have around Saint Patty's day, which by the way isn't around my birthday, but it just made, came to my mind. So, so when I was a kid, we had shamrock shakes. Saint Patty's Day, they're mint shakes. And when I was a kid, they were amazing and I was so, and I hadn't had one in 30 years, maybe more, maybe 40 years, hadn't had a shamrock shake. And I saw a little advertisement. I said, all kids, guess what? These are like mint chocolate chip

Speaker 3:          01:37:55       milkshakes, but there's no chocolate chips. So it's just smooth mint ice cream milkshake from Mcdonald's. Yup. Can I sent my daughter out to go get us all? Go get us all shamrock shakes brought him home. They worked disgusting. They were nothing like what they used to be. Yeah. So Mcdonald's, I gave you a shot. Sorry about that. I'm surprised he gave him a shot. I am too, but it's been 40 something years beats since I had a shamrock shake and I remembered him, so I figured we'll go with it. Maybe there was gusting gather, probably go. Not even my kids liked him. Not even my eight year old Dang, who just, you know, is an eight year old that just looks at things and say, that's ice cream. I'm on it. She didn't even like it. None of them. No one. They were discussing, we threw them all away.

Speaker 3:          01:38:41       Don't waste your money. Yeah, don't waste your money. Yeah. Don't waste your money on Mcdonald's. That's my personal recommendation period. Shamrock shake or other otherwise, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not help not help. Not Helping you in any way. Did you know that they just, I mean this is gonna sound obvious now that I'm saying it out loud. They add the green coloring to it, to the ice cream. Make it green. Well, yeah, when you get briars it's white. Yeah. I got here, I've talking to him one, I mean my wife and whatever family, the family goes to a, or the Oregon coast. That's where the Tillamook cheese factory. Wait chief. Yeah. Tillamook cheese. The actual big factory. And you can go on little tours and they give you ice cream. I'm like, okay, I want that mint mint chip of course. And they give it to me and they hand it to math and I'm like, the first time I see it, I was like, Hey, that's not mine.

Speaker 3:          01:39:32       That's obviously just the regular chocolate over here. And I for real said that. I was like, oh, I ordered the mint. And he goes, Oh yeah, that's meant. And then it all kind of came to me like, Oh yeah, I'm pretty dumb for if you get briars. Briers is white, which is the preferred brand, to be quite honest with you. Is it okay. All right. Well, at least at least the ones that I've tried. Yeah. So, so back to the birthday thing, if you miss the birth of your child, technically you're right. Technically for the question, because I'm talking about like how upset or how much is it going to mean not affected at all at all really. But here's the thing, if it like as a cohesive family, that might be a thing. If you have the option, I'm saying if you're overseas, come, come on man, let's face it.

Speaker 3:          01:40:20       That's a legit, but if you have the choice, so you miss the birth of your child, that's more of like a family thing. Like, okay, but that's not what, that's not the question because it's always the first birthday, the first year birthday. That's kind of a, it's for the adults. Yeah. It's for the other people. Second, third, fourth, and fifth. The fourth. And in my experience, maybe they're in the game a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. It depends on the kid who's conditioned them that they don't expect anything good. Yeah, I guess, yeah. Life Sucks, man. Life sucks. Nothing special about your stupid birthday. Everybody loses a bunch of, you were born on that day. A bunch of people born tomorrow. A bunch of people born yesterday. Get over yourself, kid. Concur, four years old. I know. Bunch of people who turn four anyway. Uh, agree. I think that age two all the way to 21 that's my opinion. Those are the ones that if they want you there, ew, ew, ew. I don't make cars going to watch around at her 21st birthday. She better otherwise. Cabo going to say that. Right? She's not a lot in comp. Cabo, Shinola, check. We're going to be way more. Yeah, more Jocko. What do you think about when you don't feel like getting after it?

Speaker 1:          01:41:42       You know, I put this out the other day and I think it's important. All right, so Rome wasn't built in a day. We all know that. Everyone hears that, but Rome also didn't fall apart overnight either. It took hundreds of years for Rome to reach its peak, but it also took time, hundreds of years for Rome to decay and fall apart, and that is representative of life because you don't achieve worthwhile goals quickly or easily. They take time, they take struggle, they take relentless pursuit day in and day out. That's what it takes.

Speaker 4:          01:42:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:42:53       But also things don't usually fall apart quickly either. At least at first it, it's, it's a slow process. A little slip here, little set back over there, a little wearing down of discipline and will over time. That's the thing. Success and failure are generally slow processes either slowly building things up or gradually tearing them down. And that's why I say you've got to pay attention. You have to watch, you have to watch every single second.

Speaker 4:          01:43:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:43:57       Because those seconds they turn into minutes and minutes turn into hours and hours turned into days and days turn in two years.

Speaker 4:          01:44:14       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:44:16       Hints. So that second, that second that just went by. That counted. Thanks. So did that second and so did that one and Ian, those precious seconds, you are either building or you were decaying. You are either gaining ground.

Speaker 4:          01:44:44       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:44:45       Or You were losing ground in that second and in every second, every second counts.

Speaker 4:          01:45:03       So make every second count. And I think

Speaker 1:          01:45:18       that's all I've got for tonight. So Echo, if people want to make it count for this podcast,

Speaker 4:          01:45:33       maybe you could

Speaker 1:          01:45:35       tell them how they can go ahead and do that if they want to. Sure.

Speaker 3:          01:45:41       Be Happy to actually, when we're talking about origin, why did Pete choose origin as thinning? He told the story, right? That must be slacking on the listening on though. Nonetheless it makes sense because the origin of all these, all the gear is here in the u s just happens to be. But that's a big thing. The origin. So what do we make gies out of say cotton, you know? Okay, well we'll just take the cotton, grow the cotton in the u s what do they do with the cotton?

Speaker 1:          01:46:20       Turn it into they do. Yeah. Yes. Stuff. Diet. Yeah. Turn it into a fabric. Oh yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:46:28       yeah. And they do all of that. They don't import it, you know, from wherever. You know, some undisclosed American Hailey's. Yeah. Anyway, so maybe that's why it's called origin. Cause the origin is a significant thing. Right. Anyway. All right, cool. So origin, what is origin? Origin is the best gear in the world. Straight up. Objectively, not subjectively. Objectively. I

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       got proof bump, so I got to Ge. We went to this origin immersion camp for Jujitsu origin, Jujitsu immersion camp. Nope. Good Fun. By the way, that was your first time in the origin g wasn't it? Yes, I think. Yeah. Yeah. I saw you with yours. It was cool. Um, yeah, so cool camp. Got The g, um, then I come home, got to, by the way, actually I got to keep tops one pair of pants. Um, come home, made me want to train more in the gay. By the way, I thought, I don't know if it was the gay or the camp. We're both probably both. Yeah. Anyway, so this whole week I changed and every single time I went in someone mentioned the Ge and it's not like it's pink or something like that. When they're like, hey CFO, put on his g, yeah, it's normal.

Speaker 2:          01:47:43       You can get the blue. I had the, I have the white one and everyone is like, oh, what's that? Jeff Glover was one of them. And this is the person who's like, you know, if he says that it's something, it's not like some, you know, fashion person has had don't like that logo or that's a cool, you know, anyway, it was someone who knows. Anyway, everyone asking like what up with his ski. So I go into the spiel made here. I might have lost somebody cause they took real long saying it. But nonetheless it's dope. And then another one was Jeff Higgs. We know who that is. [inaudible] do you know who that is? I sure do. Yeah. The person that Joppa talks about, when he first started to get introduced to Jujitsu, the guy who reintroduced to Jujitsu, he and I got introduced to Jujitsu together and then he went out and trained hard.

Speaker 2:          01:48:30       Yeah, I think it was the day he got his purple belt has purple house, the White, I mean we trained with master chief Bailey overseas that for like three months. And then we came back. We are in different platoons, but he started training for real with Fabio Santos. Yeah. And the day he got his purple belt, I'm pretty sure it was the day you got us for, well he came to my house and was like, let's go train. And I said all yeah, so think about purple belt versus white belt and he, you know, triangle arm lock, everything rear naked choke and it's Kinda tall. Too Tall. He's tall, strong, putting beat down bone. You boney like in terms of when he's impacting you with his elbows. Yeah. Real bony. He's hitting me. He's got the bones cutting. Yeah. He's like this triangle feels like it's going to cut your head off cause he's bony. Yeah. He knows some good judo too, Huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And he's got a real, he's got a real, um, he's always in touch with the whole idea of using this to effectively defend yourself in a street and scenario. He's always in touch with that. He always adds in a little, and if you're in the

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       street you could do, there's four idea. He did that. I went up to studio five 40. Yeah. Oh, oh for Berry Street. I had to train at 10:00 AM I had some stuff to do and then they were only doing no gay at the VI suckled studio five 40 he exists teaching the class. Rob's Apps, he's the owner or whatever. Even he mentioned the Ge, he was like, well, he's like, what gives is this? Yeah. Cause it's a different material specially not only specially made, especially woven, specially designed for Jujitsu. Yeah. So yeah. And I was like, Oh yeah, that's that origin stuff. Don't worry about that. And he's like, oh I like, I think I might have one. You know, he's the kind of with like 1000 sec, I think I have one of these or whatever. And I was like, you don't have this one bro.

Speaker 3:          01:50:30       And I just kept walking, you know. Anyway, then afterwards it was afterwards when Higgs was like, he's like, this is the, I think he even said this is the most interesting gay. And he was like rubbing it in his fingers, you know, when he grabbed my sleep, if this is the most interesting guy I've ever seen, something like that. You know when that's the axiom guerrilla we've, yeah, cause they have a normal per wave, which looks like the little tiny purse. Sure. American parole. But the axiom that gorilla weave is, or is it the Dragon? We've, they both look very similar. Yeah. But they're both, we've, oh yeah. One of them looks like, um, like it's like, I'm not going to say velvet, I'm not going to do that. But it looks like that, you know. No, it looks like diamonds. Which one was the one, remember we were looking at, um, and uh, we were looking and they were saying like, like I was like, Dang, this looks super luxurious.

Speaker 3:          01:51:21       That's not the one I have. By the way. He was like this up. The other one, I don't know which one was which. But nonetheless, people seem to like the geeks and the pants are dope. It has the, it's like you can choose drawstring, but it has the, um, like, you know, like surf shorts where they have the velcro Boehm and it's like fitted. They go and sizes like of your waste. It's not just like er, uh, which actually I'm not against the whole a one 82 83, you know, I'm not against that. It's actually, it's fine. It's cool. Super simple. Um, but this is good. It's like when you get it, you can order yours, pant size, boom. But you know, when you put it on it's going to be dope anyway. And it is dope. And you know, the public responded in that way as well.

Speaker 3:          01:52:03       So also rash guards, tee shirts. Yeah. We're gonna make a bunch of other stuff. Yeah, there's some cool stuff on there and the point is really sure. I'm talking about the guy because I was all up in that gee this week and that's fresh on my mind and it's one of those things that sticks in there. Um, also at the camp, um, you know how like when you give your laundry, I only had one. So you give your laundry, you, you're out of Ge, you can't go to the next session unless you get another Gig, which is kind of, I wasn't really about that, but so I would use them twice in a row and they dry surprisingly fast. It's not going to surprise. They drive fast. They're not a hundred percent cotton and polyester. I think in there with silver coated, they non-AHC Kenny. It's antimicrobial.

Speaker 3:          01:52:47       Silver coating on it. Not like silver. You can see it. Yeah. But yeah, that's why that's the thing, that's the same thing with mine when I pulled mine out, when I pull mine out of the washing machine after the spin cycle, it's almost dry. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like a pair of surf shorts basically. But Dang, it feels comfortable. It's nice. Yeah. So yeah, man. Anyway, so yeah, or origin main, like the State Maine, not m. I. N I mean I and eat. So origin main.com go on there. There's a lot of cool stuff on there, man. A lot of it. Oh yeah. Check that one out. That's the best gear in America. All made in America. Best gear in the world. All made America also Jaquis some supplements. So still on origin main.com right. There's a part and I was, cause I was looking for him.

Speaker 3:          01:53:32       You go on the top and it's his labs. You Click on there, boom. That's where all the supplements. Super Krill cause normal meal. You mean Jocko Supercrown soccer. Super Cruel. He couldn't just do the Krill Oil Honda. You couldn't no, no, no, no. That's super girl. Super Cool. Like, like it Krill when you can get Super Krill, one of those deals. Super close. Got The capes on. All right, cool. There you go. And you know, um, joint warfare, which is, you know, a blend of joint. Yeah. Furbished is Furby shingle word for refurbishing. Right. But the refurbishing is just doing it again or, yeah, for sure. For a machine. And that's got the things that I always take. Curcumin [inaudible] and the [inaudible] is in the form of sea cucumber suite. That's where it comes from me. So yeah. Well, the legit, the ancient not interesting, I guess you could call it layers is this is exactly what you were taking for years and you were like gay guests.

Speaker 3:          01:54:41       What origin in the house? Let's just make that, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well sometimes I'd have to combine different things before. Yeah. But now I don't have to combine anything anymore. They're already combined joint. We're going to combine it into one deal. Yeah. It's warfare. Joint warfare against doing against joint weakness. Yup. It's a good idea too, by the way, because now I've got two kids. I remember when I told the story like, you know when you wake up and my daughter, she told that story. Yeah. I'm going to tell it again. So she's the jump on my back when I, when you, right, when you wake up that's your least warm. That's when you're trying to warm up and get, do physical stuff that least warm you'll ever be just in everyday life is when you wake up. Yeah. Those first 12 burpees or are hard one hour before you do the burpees that moment.

Speaker 3:          01:55:28       So this is the exact moment when my daughter, you know, 40 pounds or so jumped on my back, my shoulders, my back, where my shoulders, whatever she chose. And you know, after I took Krill for, I think it was like five, six days, boom. I could easily do it. I didn't have to like focus on my form, nothing like that. Now I've got two kids and my daughter who's older is heavier. So not this morning, yesterday morning I go to wait grill up for school or whatever. I already have my son, he weighs, I don't know how much she weighs, but he's one, I have him, she still wants to jump on my shoulder. I have him cause he's like, oh. And then he sees her jumping asleep shit. So basically I'm the, what do you call it, the vehicle that they're writing on early in the morning, by the way.

Speaker 3:          01:56:13       Still no problem. Still going strong. So yeah, man, that's it. That's a joint warfare situation right there and Krill supercrew. Get on it. You'll be glad you did. Also checkout on it.com/jocko this is where I get my kettle bells. Then I meant, I mentioned this, I got the gorilla ones, 72 pounds. So I'm cruising right, not lifting, cruising and jade comes, my brother comes in. I was like, I was like, yeah, go check out this new kettle bells I got. And it goes, it's all, Yay. Those are cool. I was like, go ahead, pick them up. He goes and make that kind of heavy, you know? But I've been doing kettle bells, so I was like, Nah, let me show you what not even warmed up. Nothing. Speaking of Krill oil. Yeah. It was actually really the Krill oil springing into action. Really. Boom. I do it. And um, you know, had to show him what up nonetheless that was done with those kettlebells, which are dealt by the way. Um, I'm not gonna say get the designer ones. I'm not gonna say that.

Speaker 2:          01:58:49       It seems like an opportune time to talk about your other video camera.

Speaker 3:          01:58:54       Sure. Oh yeah. Yeah. Or maybe not actually, it's a good story though. It's not like a tragic story, which it kind of felt like when you mentioned it, I was like, oh, it brought me back. Okay. So here's the story.

Speaker 2:          01:59:10       We go to Maine, right? Technically we go to Boston, then drive to me. Yup. Right. So, you know, dude, too drunk to drive to you when we rent a car. Well, the car rental place and I have three bags. Will you have what? One, two, yeah. Two bags. Vessel, five bags. Total cuter bag and my suitcase. Yeah, so five bags total. I have a big bag with equipment in it,

Speaker 2:          01:59:33       suitcase with, you know, did you just see stuff and clothes and whatnot. And then the third bag, which was the carry on bit pretty big, you know, most important was important. Has a um, it has an important camera in there that I use. My, my favorite camera I've ever had really good camera. Uh, has some value to it will say. And it's a red camera. Yeah, it's epic. W technically it's, it's an awesome camera. Is it the best you can buy or is there one more? It depends on what you mean, but best. But it's, yeah, there's one sort of level. Okay. Well I'll tell you this, it ain't cheap. No, it ain't cheap at all. In some places in the country you could buy a house for the cost of this camera. Yeah. So it's an expensive camera. Yeah. And, and you'd think like, okay, echo is going to take really good care of this stuff, which I do.

Speaker 2:          02:00:23       Really, that's what I carry it on. Boom, boom. You know, doesn't even trust anyone touching it. Cause going to carry it with them. Yeah. Okay. Continue. So boom, we hit in the rental car, we got apparently got five bags, still count for a was there, there was no, there was some kind of confusion. You know what happened? Yes, there was. Yes. Remember, because remember when you were getting in, what was it, like an expedition or something like that. And now those new ones have that automatic tail door that goes up and you know what it was, I think there's like a sensor under the bumper that if you like put your foot under there, it closes. Like if you know, like a hands free closing the door situation. So the thing started closing all the main Dako yeah. And the girl, the rental girl was trying to save me.

Speaker 2:          02:01:02       Yeah. And she couldn't. Yeah. So he always like be strong for her, which was kind of funny cause I didn't even care, but I just kind of like put my back into it and stopped. But I was watching her kind of chuckling because she's trying to stop it and it wasn't stopping. It was, she was looking, she had a look on her face like I was about to die. She tried to work up like Indiana Jones. I was going to get my head cut off by the door slamming shut and I was just kind of like laughing at the whole situation. But that caused some confusion. Apparently it was like your mind, it was like a little micro emergency that happened and so I was like boom, flustered but wait what all the bags are in or not and we're trying to fit. Remember cause we were trying to get the seats down the way.

Speaker 2:          02:01:39       There's like maybe three quads I major things going on now and you know for the sake story I'm just going to continue. So bull, we get it all, all, we get it all loaded and at one point like we're like halfway up there's a three hour drive and by the way if we don't stop and we did stop. So it was like five hours or something like that. So we stopped and I remember his daughter got fried chicken by the way. It was good and I was stoked nonetheless. I had a thought and it was literally lasted three seconds. Like, I don't really remember putting my camera bag in the car, but what am, I do not put it in the car. It's like the most important back. So whatever. So we just continue, we get up there and right as we pull into like park tied seconds later, we're in the back country of Maine.

Speaker 2:          02:02:34       Yeah. Like not even knowing first time there by the way, which I dunno what that even means, but either way we're there and I'm all pumped up cause my rib, I was stoked to go in and see everybody and hang out. Yeah. You can see everyone. Everyone's inside the light of the gym so they can't see that were outside. Yeah. So I'm all but I'm stoked. So it's, yeah, the beginning of the deal can finisher if you will. And um, right as we kind of rolled to a stop, I'm thinking, man, did I, you know, he kind of account we're here and now you start to account for it. And I don't remember that stuff. So the first thing you can do, I look in the backseat cause that's where it would've went. Not there. And I look in the back, not there and you know, you get that cold feeling that just rushes over your body.

Speaker 2:          02:03:15       I go, oh my God. So I'm like, man, so whatever I tell you and you're like, whoa. You know, get on the phone, you know, call the airport and Bra. You ever tried to call him the airport or something? Yeah, I told you this afterwards. My opinion was at that point, divers, that thing's gone. 100% gone, gone 99.9999% you're never going to see that thing again. I had already cut it away emotionally and detached from it and I was kind of thrown you bones like yeah, call the airport, maybe they can help you. That was actually nice of you because you really, you seem like you care. Not necessarily about the Karen necessarily, but you cared about me. You know, like early fan. I thought that thing was gone. There's no chance of getting it back, get over it. And I was a little bit, well I said, you know, is there podcast recorded that you don't have copies of on there?

Speaker 2:          02:04:00       And you said, no, they're all uploaded. I'll say, good thing. Awesome. Cause we're never going to see that thing again. And I was thinking, I'll see it again in three months, maybe when they finally recover it from Austin, found from the Boston airport by the way. Or I get my insurance money for down the line and then you got to go read, go through the purchase process, which is a thing, but we don't have it for this trip for sure. And later on I found out or realized that we have the podcasts like SD cards in there. So while we, I guess we could have just bought some anyway, nonetheless we get there and I'm calling the airport and right on the airport recording picks up. Yeah. Just get this feeling like, oh my gosh, I'm just completely going through the motions right now. No one's going to pick up and be like, sure, I'll look for it.

Speaker 2:          02:04:46       Yeah, I got it. And no one, that's not going to happen. But I keep calling and I'm like, I'm not going to be the guy who didn't do everything I can. So I'm calling or whatever. Meanwhile, we got to go talk to Pete, we got to, you know, all this stuff that you released me. You go, hey man, go ahead and make these calls. And I was like, okay, cool. You hang out with that. Just make us totally worthless effort because you're never seeing that thing again. I'll go hang out with people. Yeah. So after like a few minutes of that, I go in, I'm like, you know what, let me, let me kind of cut it away and saying, let me at least it embraced it. You know what we're doing. Go in and you kind of kind of casually in a way mentioned like, hey, there's some guys from the police.

Speaker 2:          02:05:21       If that came across casually, casually, I shouldn't have made it come work because I met a bunch of guys, you know, everyone was just saying hi. And a couple of guys are, you know, yeah, we're, we're cops and [inaudible] down in Massachusetts and right by boss to go right next to it. And, and I met them and then you stroll back in and you met a couple people. And then I said, you talked to anybody. Well, yeah, I talked to this and they're going to look whatever. I'm thinking you have things gone. And I said, you know, if there's anyone in the world that could like make something happen right now it's cops. Yeah. So it's, it's Boston cops. Ravinia cops and what? And, and I just said, I said, bro. And I was a little, this is my ego. I was embarrassed for you. I felt bad that you had to go and tell somebody that you lost this.

Speaker 2:          02:06:10       Yeah. Sick camera. And so I just said, hey man, those guys over there, they're cops. And if there's anyone that gets going to get this thing back, it's them. Yeah. And I'm thinking, you know, the whole story where like, did you see this? So did you not think that they were going to be able to help? I thought that they'd be like, Oh, you lost your bag. Like everyone does every single day at that airport. Oh, we're cops, bro. We have crimes to solve. Yeah, no, I get your stupid. My attitude of that thing being gone actually changed. As soon as I connected it and said to myself, oh they're cops, we're going to, we're going to turn this over to them and they can make things happen that, that, that's good. And Youth and even me when I was like, okay, I'm going to mention it to these cops and these cops are going to be like diva, like what do you, what do you think our job is?

Speaker 2:          02:06:55       You know, to go recover your lost luggage. He's like w three hours away by the way. No. So I'm like, you know what Jocko said to do it, I'm just going to do it. This is another go through the motions thing. So I kind of timidly go Dennis and Nate, they were there, they just rolled it, whatever. And I was like, Hey, I lost the bet. And they were like, what did it look like? Like they kind of were into it. I was like, oh this is promising, you know, like they actually care. Cause I was thinking they'd be like, man, that's a sad story. Broke. I'm going to go talk to Jocko again, you know, kind of thing. I thought that was going to happen. And they were like, no bro. They get on the phone and they're like, what'd it look like? Boom. One more question like, Oh, where are you? Where'd you leave it? Okay, boom, back on the phone, back on the phone. These two guys, I'm like,

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       oh this is, it's starting to kind of look up. And he's like, okay. So they hang up the phone. He was like, just a waiting game. Now just a matter of time I got this, I got this guy and I'm like thrilled. They're like, yeah man, just the waiting game. So we're talking called it. They called all their bros is out there and there was like a force of troopers from my daughter to get in there. Had that thing recovered in what, 20 minutes, how many minutes? They hang up and they're like, just amount of time bro. And then we just start talking about other stuff. Yeah. You know, kind of teasing me a little bit, whatever. I deserve it and I'll even 10 times up. But, and then we were talking about other stuff. Boom. His phone rings, he's on it. He's like, is it of mine?

Speaker 3:          02:08:10       Shift bit bag and all this and describing it, I don't even know. That's how I'd have to, I'm like, yeah, I think so. Go inside and needs any, any bus up my laptop or whatever. It's matching the description and in my mind I'm like, there's no way he found it. Like a cop's not going to just roll into the Logan Airport and find my bag. No way that's going to happen. But it happens. Sure enough, he's like, Oh, you're a fragment cause it has a fragment sticker on my laptop. And he's like, frag mobile like that. We'll pull the feeling turned into just warmth and love and rainbows on this guy. I was like, that's the one they're like, and you know, they're kind of, they didn't actually high five, but they're kind of like almost like, you know, this was this little tasks. They kind of bonded over that and just like that morning minutes, man who drove it up?

Speaker 3:          02:08:54       Um, Robbie, that's his name, right Ravi. Yeah. I owe him a role. Um, actually there was another guy, Callahan who was the guy who went and grabbed, so he was like a coordinated dealmaker and um, man does like one of the more heroic things that has happened to me and in the recent past. So you've got the camera back, got the camera behind the computer and we're good. So in the event, so the point is in the event of you shopping for cameras can get a red camera on Amazon, but if you want to get like a Sony HD handicap or whatever you're using because it broke in the luggage. I'm not saying that happened to me, I'm just saying if that ever happened to you and to get another one, boom, you can go through their Jocko store.com click through and thanks to everyone to cut that camera back.

Speaker 3:          02:09:38       Yeah, much appreciated. And the laptop with all kinds of videos and important stuff on it. Yeah. Actually those guys are on the laptop but, but yeah, man Dennison, Nate, the primary guys, Mr. Callahan, I didn't meet him but he's done because he recovered that. And then Robbie, I owe you a role. Oh you two rules. I owe you a lot, man. You the man, he's the one who delivered it so big up to all of them. Big Time. So also back to support of Jocko podcast, subscribe to the podcast, iTunes, stitcher, Google play. It's a good way to support kind of kind of kind of obvious like oh yeah you subscribed already. But some people, maybe they didn't. Maybe they were just kind of maybe wish not wishy washy but you know, kind of still on the fence. But man do it well at your, you can unsubscribe if we're not delivering value. I don't like to use that expression. Adding value. Everyone uses thinks it's cool. I thought

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       it was cool the, if we're not adding value, you cannot subscribe if you want. Also subscribe on Youtube. What's the recent development? Oh your book. Dismissible field manual field manual, which she'll talk about later. We put a video on there. It kind of little summary. I was real excited to see that video come out. Yeah. And I was, we, you know, we were texting back and forth and he said, well, how about, you know, we will, I'll put it out tomorrow, but it's ready. And I said, just put it out now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Late. Then you said launching in three, two and then there was, and I went to my youtube on my phone and I was refreshing, refreshing, refreshing, refreshing, refreshing. And I wanted to catch it like the first person to catch it. I'm refreshing, refreshing. And this happened, I got a ping from my mail on my phone and I switched to mail and it said Jocko podcast is upload a new video.

Speaker 2:          02:11:37       So that's one of the benefits of subscribing to the youtube channel. If something comes out, you can have it email you if you want it to, if you can have it, email you when something new comes out and otherwise there's no way you'd know. Yeah. So if you, if you care about they 10 stuff, which you know, it's one of those deals where, yeah, sure, you get the video version of the podcast. If you care what we look like, you just fine. Actually, people will play it on their TV, like in their little home gym or something like that, which was cool. It's kind of like we're all there together, you know? Um, and then, yeah, some excerpts in there. The video that you made for the book. Yeah. I think it might be your best video ever. It might be. I think it's up there man.

Speaker 2:          02:12:16       I was, yeah, I was talking. It's real good. I'll talk to somebody on face book and they're like, oh hey, that video was cool. And I thought about saying like, oh, that was like, you man. Thanks for that. But I thought about it. It's like, wait, Jocko kind of did all the work. Really. You know, you're the one working out your word that you saying the words I said, all I did was put some cool music and some words on there. They'd, all that other stuff happened in there. The words and the way it's all coordinated together and all that stuff. So I have two lights on there nonetheless. You know what, I'm to be honest. Um, I like how it came out too. He was good. He's theory, they're getting the best one. Hey men. You know, it depends on what you mean by best, you know, I dunno.

Speaker 2:          02:12:54       Impactful and then back. Well sure. That's a good one. I liked it. Yeah. It was, if someone wasn't subscribed to the youtube channel, yeah. They might not, never know that that video exists. That's true. And that that's, that hurts or no Facebook or no Twitter or no, nothing. Yeah. Yeah. So choose your, your, your wealth that I tweeted that one out, but I don't always tweet out when something comes out. Yeah, yeah, that's true. No. Yeah, don't always do that. Sure. So if you subscribe, you'll know regardless of what my actions are. That's true. And you know, choose whether or not you want an alert. You know, sometimes you don't want that alert every single time, but sometimes you do. You know, I'll put

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       some deleted scenes on there as well. Anyway. Nonetheless. Yeah. Youtube channel, we have one and it's cool. I think it's cool. Juggle things at school law. I just got a little thing. Youtube kind of changed their look on Youtube. I don't know if you notice that. It's hard for me to judge because I have youtube red now. No ads, so dope. Nonetheless, I liked the ABS ads. Actually they did good. A good thing with the ads now. Now you can click like, I don't like this ad or you can give that so you can kind of narrow down the ads. You See, I liked the movie trailer ads. You know like I don't like in the ads. Yeah, I did watch what I want to watch everyone else get away from me. Yeah, yeah. I dig it. I dig it fully. Oh nonetheless, the point there is subside.

Speaker 3:          02:14:14       Subscribe to the Youtube Channel is a good way of supporting the podcast if you want to. Also Jocko was a store. It's called Jocko store, Jocko store.com. Of course. Very creative name by the way. I guess technically I came up with a name. You did. This store is your storage chocolate store. I concurred with the name. Yeah, so what do we have on the store? If you don't know already, we've got shirts on their rash, guards, travel mugs, some bumper stickers, patches, hats, ball cap hats. Not like, did you remind today top hats? You don't look like you did. Yeah. No I did. And Harris Servo. You want me nine?

Speaker 3:          02:15:00       None the less they're on there. Jocko. xero.com. I guess technically you could go to your own story and get a hat or nine hats as the case may be. I'll do that today. Thank you. I appreciate it. If you want, if you want to, um, so women's stuff on there. Some hoodies, we want to get a thicker hoodie. That's what we're doing, right. I know you said it a bunch of times, but um, yeah, we'll work on that. So there, boom, hoodies. Uh, I think what, what's the next move? What's the next thing? Winter Hoodie. Winter Hoodie. Yeah. Yeah. I think it should be. I think I'm going to put a warrior kid rash guard on there too, for four. Where he kids doing no Guid Jujitsu or even, gee, you know, you were the RushCard under the east sometimes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that'd be dope stuff nonetheless. Jackals store, that's where you get Jocko stuff.

Speaker 3:          02:15:55       It's pretty cool. So I'm not saying to buy something. I'm saying go on there, check it out. If you like something, get something good way to support all. So psychological warfare, if you didn't know what that is, it is an album with tracks, Jocko checks, Jocko saying stuff to you. So if you listen to it, it's not like a story, right? Like, you know, a lot of times it's not music, obviously. It's not Jocko singing hardcore, which you do from time to time by the way he ever ride. And here's a kind of a rhetorical question. Kay, have you ever written you Jocko, but the people out there, have you ever written with Jocko for five hour, three to five hours in a car? No. Okay. Let me tell you what it's like. Part of what it's like, it's Jocko drumming even in the airplane by the way.

Speaker 3:          02:16:43       Drumming on, what do you call that? The handle in the door and like you're doing like drums bump and then singing under his breath. Hardcore stuff. Um, what else are you seeing? What are you looking? Was like Tom Petty or say it wasn't Tom Petty. It was something anyway. I have no idea. Yeah, but it was songs I was, I noticed occasionally I'd look at you and you'd be looking like, can you please stop? Yeah, yeah. Which I got a kick out of me. Yeah, you were born. Yeah. Or, or stop the car and like get out or something. Yeah. You get out and walk. Yeah. Million drums. That was the look for sure. Yeah. Wait, no, you get out. Stop playing drums and get out. That was the look. Nonetheless, these tracks are not that they're him, him [inaudible] talking to you, telling you pragmatic ways to get over your current weakness.

Speaker 3:          02:17:30       What? Weakness. Okay, so let's say you're trying to stick to a good diet, right? Try to wake up early or all of the above. Right at this moment. Actually currently 48 hours right now. Currently. Yeah. Feeling good too. I guess technically I'm fascinating too because they ate a salad. Oh hardcore workouts or yesterday and today rolled last night, 70% ribs a little tweaked still. But Andy Dean light roles a little bit with Nam. I think that was it. But yeah, no listing the whole time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep. So technically, am I fascinating if I ate a salad at like 1145 last night? Well he knows it and drank some coffee. Yeah. Fast, fast, 24 hour fast. No, no. Oh, 12 hour fast fasting. Got It. Is there such thing as an eight hour fast? I think that's just life. I think it's like four and a half.

Speaker 3:          02:18:28       If you're not doing, if you're not doing at least 12 hours, 12 hours is the cutoff for calling Nicole. I don't know what to cut off the steering. I'm not a doctor or even a nutrition goal. You're fasting right now currently. What if like you just didn't eat yet, whatever, and I just didn't eat yet. There's a difference. Yo. So what's the difference? That's the question. I don't know. Hey, you're, you're a man of humility. You say you didn't know and you to know. I like that. Nonetheless. Back to the psychological warfare. If you're trying to stay on the fast or wake up early every morning, you know, or stick to the Diet, stay in the program, whatever, in whatever way, ways that you have opportunities to slip. This is an album with tracks that tell you why you shouldn't slip on your waking up early, your diet, your working out. My whole thing. You know, like I've said before, if I don't feel like working out, I kind of tend to be like, oh, maybe I'll rest today. Maybe I'll do it later. You know, that whole thing, not good. Yeah, this helps with

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       that. It'll just tell you like why it'll, how in a nutshell tells you the benefits of not slipping and the repercussions of slipping. That's in a pragmatic way, but does Jocko telling it to you so it works 100% of the time. My experience, speaking of fasting, people ask me this all the time, when you're fasting, do you eat anything? Yeah, I do actually. Sunflower seeds, sunflower seeds, because it takes you like 37 minutes to have one little tiny seed to get it chewed up in a so, right. But they're, but they're good because they keep you occupied and you're chewing and they taste good and blah, blah blah. Sometimes I'll grab a handful of nuts, just mixed nuts. Just maybe one in the morning, maybe one at night, one handful and Jocko white tea. Boom. That's the things. Now sometimes I won't eat the nuts, but I dunno, I I, I'm you gotta be careful that you don't have 13 handfuls of nuts.

Speaker 1:          02:20:29       Yeah. Cause I was like, I'm just talking like a handful of nuts. Right. Um, but Jocko white tea, I have that for sure. And you know what, if you call me now or you want to put like, oh, you weren't really fast and because you have Jocko white tea and you have a handful of nuts. I mean, if you think about the amount of calories that I burned on a daily basis, a handful of nuts as basically and insignificant, but whatever. Maybe I'm doing it wrong. That's okay. I'm just telling you what I'm doing. I'm not telling you to do it. I'm not telling you to copy what I'm doing. I'm just telling you what I'm doing right now. Don't imitate me. Go find a professional to talk about fasting. I'm just telling you what I'm doing. Jocko white tea. Let me tell you, it tastes good.

Speaker 1:          02:21:07       It feels good and increases your deadlift about 12 fold or so. Yeah, so that's real good for you. You can get it on Amazon. Also on Amazon, you can get some books, extreme ownership, combat leadership. I appreciate everyone that gets it for themselves and then gets it for their teams and sends pictures of 47 extreme ownership copies stacked up. I got something else for you that's awesome. And get it for your business associates, people that you work with, but they're not in your company. You get it for them and that's going to improve everything in your world too, because then they start taking ownership of problems and everything gets better. So I got, I've had a lot of people that have said, hey, I gave this to this person. I gave this to this partner that I used to have and now he's got his own business, but we're working together and I gave him the book and now we're working together even more.

Speaker 1:          02:21:58       So there was a good idea for you weigh the warrior kid. This was awesome. At the origin camp, I'll bunch of people from all over the northeast brought their kids up to to meet, hang out, get a signature and all that. And what's cool is what's cool. Kids tell the truth, you know what I mean? They don't even, they're not aware of, they don't care about your feelings at all. And it's awesome to, you know, say I always say to Kiddo, did you read that book? And they go, yes, I go, how'd you like it? And they all say, Oh, I love it. It's awesome. And we know your Jocko and thank you for writing it. And those kids are getting stronger and smarter and tougher and better. Yeah. So you want to help out kids that you know, get them this book right here, discipline equals freedom field manual.

Speaker 1:          02:22:49       That's what it is. It's a field manual. For those of you that don't know what a field manuals in the military, a field manual is. The instructions on how to do something in the field, whether it's attack a strong objective or whether it's dual recognizance or how to conduct a patrol. The field manual gives you the instructions on how to do that and that's what this is. The discipline equals freedom. Field manual is a field manual on how to implement discipline into your life. There's zero amount of fluff in here. There's zero. There's nothing in there that you'd say you're going to say to yourself, well, I think Jocko might've just thrown this in here for, you know, kind of take up some space in the pages. Didn't happen. Rather not do it. Rather burn the whole book. Don't care about that. The book's not long enough. Cool. Read less. So that's what it is. Get it from your local bookstore. So go down to the neighborhood bookstore and tell him you want this book or you can get it from Barnes Noble. You can get it from Amazon. Let them know what's up.

Speaker 1:          02:23:54       It's in the get after it section of your local bookstore. If they have one. If they don't have that section, they need it so they can put this one book by itself in there getting after it. Your video's awesome by the way. Thanks John. For Your Business.
