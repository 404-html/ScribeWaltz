Speaker 1:          00:00:01       This is Jocko podcast number 93 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. I was lucky and blessed to have had the honor to serve in the United States military during the time of war. I fought alongside us army soldiers, sailors, and marines on violent battlefields, and I saw with my own eyes, my generation of warriors uphold the proud tradition of the American fighting man. America's military has a storied history of bravery, ingenuity, and grit, but it's most important. Tradition is the tradition of victory.

Speaker 2:          00:01:14       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:01:15       America's military wins wars. It is as simple as that. If our nation deems it morally right, an existentially necessary, then our military is unstoppable, of course, and rightfully so. The credit for victory is often given to the men on the front lines to those that are taking the fight to our nation's enemies in close combat. That credit, he's well deserved. But it is not the only credit that needs to be bestowed because it is a simple fact that many of the most critical victories in America's history, we're one not only on distant bloody battlefields, but we're also one right here at home in factories, fields and farms. You see, our ability to produce, to design, grow, build, and manufacturer has been just important to our nation's victories as our ability to fight. And throughout history, when Americans march to war, we marched wearing boots made by American hands and we wore uniforms that were cut and sewn in factories like this one, our body armor, helmets and weapons have been the products of American work ethic, skill and determination. The best planes, ships and vehicles in the world.

Speaker 2:          00:03:30       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:03:30       that carry us to war and then support us on the battlefield. They only exist because Americans built them. Without the American worker, there can be no American soldier. So let us never forget that the freedom we cherish so dearly is a gift, not only from our American service men and women, but it is also a gift from the American worker. The American worker who toils in fields, in factories, in ship yards and on job sites. The American worker who gets up day after day after day, not only to build and create products, but also to build our economy for strongest economy in the world, which gives us unmatched influence.

Speaker 2:          00:04:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:42       And gives our great nation the ability to make the world a better place. With that knowledge, I could not be prouder to stand here today and be apart of this opening. I could not be prouder to be a part of this company or a gin which like America itself, we'll succeed because of the power of the American worker.

Speaker 2:          00:05:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:22       It will succeed because of the power of American grit in origin. USA will succeed because of the unmatched power of the American dream. And I would like to thank all of you, especially America's workforce for making this dream possible. And that is a speech that I gave today in a town called Farmington, Maine and I was at the opening of the new origin USA factory. Now, as I've been saying, we are now in league with origin USA and tonight I have with me our new partner and our new friend Pete Roberts, who as you will see, has shown some pretty incredible fortitude in the business world and who I believe is just getting warmed up. So Mr Pete Roberts, founder of origin USA, black belt in Jujitsu by the way, and also black belt in making things happen. Welcome to the show man

Speaker 3:          00:07:07       audit to be everything you just said, man. Just captures everything I feel in my heart and mind for sure. When you're in that speech live was phenomenal.

Speaker 1:          00:07:21       You know, it was awesome walking around the factory and meeting people, meeting the workers here. I mean just, we came in and Jill, she was, she was, it's a week of vacation. What she doing? She's in here working, she's working and you know, just, and, and I wasn't even really, didn't really know what I was going to say. But after coming up here, meeting her, seeing the rest of the people grinding to make this happen, um, yeah, I realized that I realized exactly what I was gonna say. I was going to talk about the fact that literally metal and a battlefield, you're, you're, you're, you're propelled there by American workers and that's what this, that's what this represents. And uh, you know, we'll get into how all this kind of came together in this kind of perfect storm. Yeah. We'll get there, but we'll get there in a little while. Okay. Because first we got to know a little about a bit about you and your crazy ass, which I say with all you know, in the most complimentary possible way. So tell us about just growing up, like, get me from like birth to high school. What was that all about? Absolutely.

Speaker 3:          00:08:36       So it all started in Sparta back, man. I'm for real. It's real spartan blood for real. Yeah. No, my, my uh, what's, what's your, what's your, because Robert's isn't no Angelakis I'm Greek. Yeah. Moms and ended in July. She's great. So she's clearly Greek cause I miss clearly she's Greek and she made that bottle of off today. No, I thought she might pull out a spartan sword at some point in like attack me instead. She's pulled out a big thing of baklava and sugarcoated it. You just don't care. Did you feel guilty about eating? Um, no. I wanted more. Yeah. How do you came over here? Like where's all the pocket?

Speaker 3:          00:09:19       I'm like, it's gone. And I looked over, there's six pieces left. I had four of them. That's awesome. No, I'm a, I'm a half breed. Just half Spartan, so no, uh, yeah man. I mean like the rest of America. You know my, my grandparents immigrated from Sparta, Greece and the early 19 hundreds. Great. Graham lived to 105 legit credit. Yes. Yes. My, my semen on Jocko white tea. Do you see as some of the shoe stuff going on through it? She actually, she, I know she didn't need to be, she had the Mediterranean Diet. Nice. Hey, when my son got to meet her, but she lived for a long time, but awesome. Yeah. So from a young age, I got to see the American dream from my mom's side of the family, you know, and when we were kids, uh, I was born down in Massachusetts, Gloucester and, uh, moved up here when I was a young kid. My mom wants me to get myself and my three siblings out of Massachusetts and into the woods just cause she saw some shifts happening. She didn't like. So she brought us up here and said, make a go of it basically. And what, what business or whatever, what to date, what did your Oh, why saw, I got to see my, my family built some pretty, pretty cool businesses down in Massachusetts. So being an entrepreneur was something I always admired, uh, but didn't realize I

Speaker 3:          00:10:55       wanted to do that until a little later in life. Um, but my, my, my family down there, uh, my grandfather had a sub shop, you know, supercell for those you, I dunno, there's, that's the one of those things where they call it different things across America. A sub in New England is the same thing as a subway sandwich. Uh, also in New England, you call it a grinder. Do you call it a grinder? A grinder would be, I think technically,

Speaker 3:          00:11:26       oh no, that's not a hot sandwich. That's Hoagie. Oh yeah. Hoagies boy. Yeah, that's another one. Uh, poor, poor boy, another word for it. So sub, sub. So granddad owned a sub shop, a few, a few subs. Very successful with the sandwich making. Nice. Uh, I got to see that in my cousin's built a big multi, multimillion dollar company and I, and I had the watch this from a way cause I moved up to here to Maine when I was eight years old. So I wasn't cultured in that at all in the business world. I didn't have anybody to teach me about business and I just got to see it in and not be directly part of it, which I always wanted to be, you know. Um, but I always looked up to them and, and, and whatnot. And both from business perspective in athletics, you know, they were very good athletics and my family and, and my uncles, cousins and stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:12:22       So I looked from afar up here in Maine and the woods and an old farm house down a dirt road with no neighbors. Cows in a field or, yeah, that's where I grew up. And then high school, you, you said you were, I know you're athletic. What do you, how, how tall are you? Six. Three and shrinking six, three and shrink and man, those and what's your Max, what's your, what are you walking around that right now? Right now I can tell you exactly to 53.0 [inaudible] yes. But you played, what'd you play? I uh, in, in high school, three sport athlete in College Football, a division one for a couple of years. I'm not the best experience of my life learning experience, but not the best. What? Well, why wasn't it the best experience in your life? Uh, you know, I was, I was real good at football. I was not passionate about it.

Speaker 3:          00:13:15       Um, but I still worked my ass off because that's the thing. You were kind of, even though you were this big Jock, I was, you are also an artistic guy, right? Artsy fartsy. I was at artsy fartsy kid. I got along with everybody, the jocks, athletes, all the artsy kids, you know, I liked everybody. I could appreciate everybody's talents where you like drawing, painting or we doing everything above painting, painting, sculpting, everything. Just doing everything and tackling people. Yeah. Getting tackled, play tight end. It's where you more passionate about art than you were about football for sure. For sure. And so you're playing football, like it wasn't just one of those things where you're like, Hey, I'm good at it and I'm getting a scholarship, so I'm just gonna keep doing what I'm doing. Yeah. So back in 1997 pair can, the jury is back in the day.

Speaker 3:          00:14:10       Yeah, no, it was, uh, back in the day, some will remember hockey fans, Mainz hockey team was phenomenal and they had to Korea kids on there and they were that that team took gifts. And what happens when you get gifts and people find out sanctions. So I went into college and they had like 10 scholarships. So I didn't actually have a scholarship until my second year of college. Kind of had to prove myself and I worked my ass off. And then I f I fell into the politics of college football and I saw the ugly side of the politics of college football. And uh, and what are you talking about? Cause I'm the only guy sitting at the table that he didn't apparently play college football is busy in the teams after it. What does it mean? What does that consist of? Like you're trying to get to be in this certain position starting or is that what we're talking about? Let's say like, okay. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:15:09       So I was supposed to, I was supposed to start my I red shirted my freshman, I was supposed to start tight end, got into a bar brawl, right. And during the summer and couldn't play the first few games. And it was me. And what, uh, one of my friends and we were, were both freshmen and he was a big kid, local kid. Uh, he ended up playing in the NFL and we were kind of like fighting for the first spot on the depth chart and a depth chart if for those of you who don't know is like kind of where you stand, right. You know, and you see your name on there and you see everyone else's name and you want to be the top guy. Right. So break that out for every position. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Every position check. Yeah. So little pressure to perform. And I stayed after my freshman. I put on 27 pounds of like hard earned muscle, no illegal substances, squats, Mcdonald's and squats.

Speaker 3:          00:16:06       Maybe like Pete, go eat some food at Mcdonald's. What did you, what, what'd you go from what weight to what weight? And I think I came into college at Lake too. It was like 200 in like two 25 and you went to no less 10 maybe. Oh Dang high school. And then uh, yeah. And then just earned it, earned it in the gym. I remember my tight end coach coming up to me and saying, Hey, you know Steve, Steve was his name. He's like, he's out. And he's like, you're going to be starting this first game. And I'm like, Shit. I mean I stayed, I stayed like work my ass off, you know, stay during breaks and everything and I was a good athlete. And what's cool is that you're actually going as hard as you can you ask something, you weren't even that passionate.

Speaker 3:          00:16:51       No, but I committed to him. He just wanted to win. Yes. Yeah, no, I do it. Okay. You look at yourself in that depth chart, even if you don't necessarily like what you're doing, you make the commitment and you drive. And I didn't want to be number two, you know, so it's super competitive. College sports. So anyways, my tight end coach, like you're starting the first game. I'm like, yes, call all my family. Call on my friends, tell them what's up, make sure everyone has tickets, Yada, Yada, Yada. Like a day before the game, the coach comes to me and says, Pete, I gotta talk to you. And I said, okay. He's like, I just got in a huge argument where the head coach and you will not be starting in the football game. I said, okay, why? He goes,

Speaker 3:          00:17:47       basically told me politics. My friend still a friend of mine, local kid, he came in on a full ride, local kid, big kid, had probably a better frame to build on. And basically what the, even though maybe I, you know, it's college, we have different gifts. The head coach shut it down and said, nope, he's not starting. My coach was like, he should start. He's performing better. You know, he's strong in the weight room, hang clean and 300 pounds. The kids ready to go. He should be starting to get a huge fight. Almost got fired. The coach at my, my Ted and coach, I'm Scott fired. He said you'll be playing a lot in the game though. But yeah, he'll be starting. And guess how much playing time I saw?

Speaker 1:          00:18:38       None. Zero. Who? So that was the first game of the season you said? Yeah. And so then what happens? You grind out the rest of the season. Yeah man. How's your attitude? I

Speaker 3:          00:18:50       worked my ass off to her. You kept grind to earn. Did you ever start?

Speaker 1:          00:18:57       Here's the shitty thing. I'd already sounded pretty sure. It's pretty shitty. Dude.

Speaker 3:          00:19:02       Here's the shitty thing and I couldn't, I'm telling you I had football, PTSD after this. I didn't watch football for 10 years. They put it on television. I'd walk out of the room, I just hang out, do something else. They'd be watching the games. My son loves football. My find, my family loves football. Couldn't do it. I had like a, just a version to the sport to make a long story short.

Speaker 1:          00:19:27       Good. Cause it's been 45 minutes. We haven't even made it past shut. How long has it been? Has It my, my uh,

Speaker 3:          00:19:34       my scholarship. The money, like, like some of the money hits your account. Right? And like shit didn't kick in for like my food and everything and my, my coach, the head coach who is a narcissistic guy, loved coming to the weight room and just like waving his hair.

Speaker 1:          00:19:51       I don't one of those guys, you know one of those guys. Yeah, call it from what grave and that he's like, I'll take care of it.

Speaker 3:          00:19:57       That's fine. Everything's happening. Okay. Week later coach still this, this isn't, you know, I'm, I'm on it. I'm on it. I'm talking with EAD. It's everything's good. We cleaner going coach. It's still like, man, I'm stressing. You know, like I'm going to have to get a job. Like what's up with this? He goes, I need to talk to you, my office and said, okay. I sit down in his office, your scholarship money is not going to kick in.

Speaker 1:          00:20:29       Really.

Speaker 3:          00:20:34       I over gave title nine had kicked in and he overcame it. Now is he being truthful with me or did he find a new recruit that was better that he pushed me out. Who knows? I don't know why. Cause the kid behind me, I ended up starting full back the next year. Right. So maybe I got pushed out. Maybe he over gave. Fact of the matter is that bastard lied to me. It didn't fall through with his word.

Speaker 3:          00:21:11       And that will never happen again. I will never surround myself with those types of people in that lesson I carry to this day, I think about it a lot. It's one of those moments in your life that kind of changes your life. I said, you know, I'm tell you something, I worked my balls off for you in this program. I'm ready and this is what I get that excuse out out of the office. I grabbed my cleats and that it of my buddy Chad Rogers and walked out the door and didn't look back. And that was that. So with that, that was your sophomore year? Yeah, that would have been my red shirt. It was right after my wrist. Yeah, sophomore year. Yeah. Yeah. So what are you studying at this time? Studying a new media, which was really new cause he remembered the Internet hidden like 97, 98 became hot.

Speaker 3:          00:22:09       Right. Really there's a date on that link. You can call it 97. That's when it became hot. Yeah, for sure. I think so. Yeah, for sure. 90 said, can you guys word for it? That's what it was like the Internet. Everybody need, everybody has the aol.com Yay. Netscape Nikki here. But you, you could really surf the web and websites and stuff. Yeah. And website development and flat. This flashy came out, macro media, all this stuff. So anyways, I was into that. I I uh, discovered the, the computer thing fell in love with design on the computer. And although I was a sculpture major, I used to weld up crazy looking shit. I I actually zippered to cope post dude I did for like my final project. You want to know what I did? I built this big frigging zipper on this like canvas and I erected it and I zippered up the gold coast. I'm talking to like the real zipper real different, you know like the thing that like the thing you hold the dude, it was this big. I sit my, my, my, my art teacher. They allowed you to do that. I didn't have a choice. I just went out and did it. Savage style. Yeah. And what's that like street art. I don't even know.

Speaker 3:          00:23:33       It was weird. I think I got some of that frustration out for sure. Bring it up. I have never made that anybody that my, my my wait, did you get graded on it? Yeah. Dude. So how did you not tell anybody? Because what happened was is I erected it in the practice field and my teacher, she walked over with me to look at it and she looked at me and she goes, a plus B. You did it listen like you did in the end. It's like, Hey, come look at this. She goes, she looked at me, she goes, you're saying what she, she didn't think it was possible, bro. When you said like I zippered my goal. Plus, I'm sitting here thinking, what is this some slang term that I don't know. Does that mean zip hang, hanging toilet paper off of it? Like what does this mean?

Speaker 3:          00:24:18       Zipper Nene zippering as what it be. I wish I had a photo of it. I wish she did. We didn't have digital cameras back then. Yeah, but that teacher was cool. She was, I don't remember her name, but she was Korean and you left it up for the practice guys. When they shut up, pull it down. Uh, she, she actually told, pulled me aside one time and she was like, you drive this class, how what you do and how you act. Every one is going to follow. Basically she was, she was pretty cool but that is was a gentle vengeance giving you props for that shipper. Done zipper it, nothing's happening. The goalpost man, I think it was called 35 feet, 30 feet, probably more than like the full goal Polo. That depends on the practice field. We helped you very fully zippered. I am not even kidding.

Speaker 3:          00:25:06       I put that I put in in a, and I, and I built it out of like wood laminated band saw like all the lugs and I had to fit together perfectly in that whole zipper part. Had the zip, it was functional national giant. That's good. I told my teacher I was new, she's like impossible to make it function. Oh, okay. Let's see. Yeah. Like I said, it's fortitude that I mentioned that earlier. So, and at this time, what are you, what's going on personally? Personal Life, don't you? With your high school sweetheart at this was, yeah. Yeah. So I, my wife Amanda, my bride, uh, we got together and we were 16, 15, 16 through, through a difficult situation. We became friends and we've been together ever since. They were drawn together by a difficult situation. And you stayed together through college? Absolutely. And she wasn't looking at you like, like, I need to get away from this guy. He said, you know, she, she's very understanding apparently. Yeah. Yeah. You know, the corny line, like you complete me. Like she, I tell people like she, if my glass is a little full, she just dumps them out and if it's running a little dry, she puts it back in. So, and she always has, you know what I mean? So she's brutally honest and

Speaker 3:          00:26:34       you know, just by my soulmate. No, that's awesome that you guys were, uh, you know, I, I knew that, but it's kind of cool that you guys together all that time

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       now back to your, your major and now, now you're not playing football and now you're sitting there in college, you're studying new media, which no one knows anything about. I didn't even know anything about it. And we actually hired the professors, my class really, we committee of students and we hire the frequent professors and so, and so then you're learning how to do what? Build websites, stuff like this. You're learning things like, uh, it's what all like the first software hit. You had like this Maya and you could do three d animation. They built like toy story in my or something you had like flash Macromedia. I remember the flash websites, all the animation and stuff like that. So we, I learned about that. So how did you make the jump from that to going into business in that

Speaker 3:          00:27:30       arena? I was good at it and I was passionate about it. And what happened is my sophomore year after I got done playing football, I went right to a marketing agency, sold myself on the spot and got hired on the spot and I became their lead web developer. And you're like 19 I was 19 with blonde hair. Nice. Yup.

Speaker 1:          00:27:57       They were like, who is this kid for? The record is when I was 19 I had blonde hair too, the day. The similarities. That's cool. Well a lot of Hawaiians have blonde hair, so, so 19 with blonde hair. Yeah, man. I walked in and I just sold myself. Okay, so then how did that morph into your own business? Yeah, so I wasn't in a cush job. I take it if you're the lead at 19 years old, cush job at 200 bucks a week, buddy raking, which I needed was pretty legit for you though, right? Yeah, because it was either

Speaker 3:          00:28:31       that or the y Ymca, you know, and I did work at the y, but uh, yeah, I mean it was, I cut my teeth at this ad agency where I learned from this really good graphic design of Brad who started his career doing pay stop. So paste up is like when you're designing an ad, you actually have to take an exam. So all the little tools you use when you're in like Photoshop and other programs, those are real tools, real life tools. So he, he takes like that knife and he cut around the picture and then they put that and then like the typography. So I cut my teeth under a real designer. Not many people get that anymore. So I learned from a master of design. And how long did you stay at that? At that agency? I was there till I was 19 2021 three years I think. And then I, then I moved back and I started my own company here. And that was just

Speaker 1:          00:29:28       inspirado what, what, what, what made you say, you know what? Because you must have seen a pathway at the agency to take over or not even take over, but just to move up the chain of command and get paid more than 200 bucks a week and all that. I did what your brain clicked

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       where you're like, you know what? I'm not working for the man. Yeah, absolutely. I'll tell you that. I got to go back to give you that though. Raking blueberries

Speaker 3:          00:29:54       and throwing hay. [inaudible] manual labor. Throw Hay for a day and get a $10 bill. You're going to work very hard not to do that. Raking blueberries in Maine, which is a staple of us Mainers. Hmm. That's tough work. Your bed, Dover in the sun and the blueberry fields. It guess what you do for your first week. You earn your rake, so what does that mean? Does a different job that they do, the rake picking or something. You've got a buy that you've got to buy the right rate. You're in debt, you're either rake and you have to work it off. How much you think that rate Costa, I'm doing the math. I'm like, [inaudible] tells me, it's like, this is tough, but I like it. So when I, when I walked into my interview at this marketing agency, this kind of a pompous, you know, kid, I said, he said, what do you want to do longterm, mark? I said, starting up my own business. I'm going to own my own business. He goes, you don't want to do that. You do not want to own your own business. You know, you don't know what it takes to survive in a world of business. And I said,

Speaker 2:          00:31:04       okay,

Speaker 3:          00:31:05       okay, proceed. Then I learned and sucked the knowledge. I could, all the knowledge I could. I just sucked it sucked and sucked it. And then, uh, I moved home and started and what city was added? I started, well, I started the business out of my college apartment. It was about as big as this table. I was the man. No, I had a little a Mac. The um, the black one, Wall Street. How would that one, there was a man called Wall Street. It had like a, it was black and had like rubber on the sides. You know what I mean? So you were the man yeah. That you had. I think that thing caused me some issues because it was very tough to have kids. I sat that thing on my lap for hours on end and I'm telling you something with radiation, man. I had to practice a lot to have kids.

Speaker 3:          00:31:55       Practice was good, but it got a little tough when it's like we can't have kids. So, but uh, yeah man, I started the business out of my college apartment, my first insight, new media marketing agency, a new media company and just started hammering and I was fearless going after accounts and clients, you know. And two years later I find myself in Park City, Utah sitting in the front of the president of Rossignol, quicksilver, selling them an idea like bill gates. I didn't exist yet. And telling them what I could do and then they gave me the money to do it and then we did it. And uh, the rest is history. So ever until the recession, so everything was rocking. And so did you, so you are in your college apartment, but then where'd you end up? I ended up here in my hometown. And you had space, you got an office in all nine yards?

Speaker 3:          00:32:47       Yeah. Well I started in a barn and it was me and another guy, my first hire and then we moved into kind of like a, like a double wide trailer house. You know, we call it a double wide. Did have a skirt? Yeah. Y'All. Yeah. Okay. Let me ask you again. All vinyl skirt. You kidding me? Who doesn't have a white skirt? Got It. Got to keep it real. So we went there and then we moved into a basement in town. This is like the perfect progression, right? Yeah. And then we hired a few more and then we moved into a beautiful, we had built out a studio where man it was, we actually designed it. And because you were making legit money now we were, how many employees are we talking about? I think maybe seven or something. 10 something like that. And now you're 22 yeah, if that, yeah. Yeah, probably 20 to 22 getting after 22 years old. Yup. Six employees. Yeah. Costumed designed office space. Everything you want to hear something, I don't even know if I should say this. You ready for this?

Speaker 3:          00:33:52       You may have to edit this out. Alright. I handled two governors campaigns in Maine, 22 years old. They wanted like the best design, the best marketing. So they came to these young ins and we had this one guy, uh, Les Otten should maybe you not say the name you, it was a national news. It's hard not to. You can cut it out. Understood. Really National News, national news. Really Nice Guy Right after Obama's first term. So les came and he wanted us to handle this campaign and so he wanted a logo that was circular, like Obama's logo. And so we did a, I designed myself a circular logo, which green and blue, very similar feel, not even close to the same, but it was around and who had done around logo at that time. Next thing I know this thing ends up on CNN, all the national news stations and they have like the two logos have Obama's logo and lessons, logo I Scott, influx of emails and phone calls.

Speaker 3:          00:35:00       People like rip it. Cause remember how that first term for old palm, remember how hot that was? Remember people negative when they were negative on you because they were like, we ripped it off. And I was like, really? Really? So it was round. Don't make around logo, especially after the first Obama don't use circles, don't use the circles. So, uh, anyways, it was, it was, it was an interesting time. There's a little bit of stress. Did he catch heat for it? Obviously, I guess. Yeah. Yeah, because no one really cared. They, you know, no one even knew they were like some, he wasn't like, oh my addict HSE made it up and I thought it was great. No. Well He, you know what they, you know, kind of a little bit, he did that, but he had an advice advisor that said this is the right direction and whatnot.

Speaker 3:          00:35:50       So it was, it was interesting times. So what was the heat to the heat was like national media, like ripping you down, people dig down who designed it, like the company that designed it and just like daring you off. They found your yearbook picture or whatever it was. That was like Obama was like 15 days of like holy shit. Like are we gonna we gonna survive this as a company, you know? And we did. Yeah. Yeah. And so you, you survived that and, and I guess your lesson is like from that, that you can survive things you're going to like, it's interesting, I just caught that you said 15 days because guess what, 15 days, no one cared anymore. Is that pretty much pretty much, yeah. Yeah. I see that a lot in the news. You know, people, some will come on to all this, people freak out about something and I'm like, yeah, wait, I'll wait a week for four days.

Speaker 3:          00:36:44       No one cares anymore. There's like some other meteor that hit the satellite thing or whatever. Yeah. So you know, it was, it was interesting, you know, we were young, you know, and naive, you know. I mean, I think all entrepreneurs start out naive honestly. And from a leadership perspective, you're in a leadership position for the first time and, and you have a team of six people, you're the man. Yup. And I'm trusting you seem you say that with a little hesitation. Yeah. I trust that people will do the right thing. Are The people that are working for you your age? A little younger? Just, just all the sides are the same age, year or two difference. All young. So now you said recession. What happens there? Well we were, we were kind of like booming as a company building some incredible that we would do interactive touch screen kiosks and all this really, really cool shit that nobody was doing it.

Speaker 3:          00:37:43       The recession hit. We lost 65% of our business overnight. I mean, what's the first thing you cut and recession advertising. You're not supposed to, but you do the wrong move, but it's the move that everyone makes. Yeah, man, I probably make the same move. Where can we cut costs ad spend, right. Stop that. Anyways, the recession hit and we had built this company from like the ground up, just funneled the money back into the company, built, built, built by equipment, Bill this, do all this stuff. I'm like, Oh shit. First time I thought about like these guys bought houses here. Have families are starting. Families moved away. How long had the run been at this point? This had been, this is a five year olds and that's a good question. When does the recession? Eight or nine this is six. Seven year run. Okay. So yeah, these guys had established their lives, they established their families up here.

Speaker 3:          00:38:43       They, you were the, for the form of income. You're how they're paying their mortgage. Absolutely. And I felt that, you know, I don't know if that's a weakness, but I'm sensitive to that man. I, that's why promise somebody something like this company is your future. I mean this company is your future. I will stop taking a paycheck and that's not the right thing to do. You got to always pay yourself. Right. I will stop taking a pay check to make sure you get yours. That's what I did. And what I also did is I took out a line of credit was the first money I had taken out from the bank ever. And I use that money to keep things going to try to get through the recession. And I didn't want to lay anybody off.

Speaker 3:          00:39:32       What I had them do was I had them start designing in house. Cause by the way, the next thing that you do after you cut advertising, the biggest cost to just about any business there is as your people people. So that's the next thing that gets cut. But you're saying you're not going to do that. And I'm, and I'm young and learning about business as I go, you know, so no, I'm not going to do it now they, some of them bought houses and stuff, you know, like I'm not taking away their livelihood, you know, I'll find a way to just get through. Right. You know, and I, and I believe I had the fortitude to get through, you know, but, and there's the, but they didn't. And here's why. Because

Speaker 3:          00:40:14       I had them start working on his house in house projects and I was training Jujitsu at the time and so I was going to develop a platform so that an academy could build a website based off of a templated system for their Jiu Jitsu school and it was going to be bad ass. And we had done this for like Rossignol Indiana Star we had, we were like one of the first companies to build online tools to build things. Make sense? There's a night early 2000 so when you go on and you look at some product and you want to, there's a little customization that can be done to it. You guys did design things to move the mouse around and yeah, there's a bunch of, there was none of them. Zero.

Speaker 3:          00:40:57       And so we started building this thing and you're be, you're building this thing but you're not being paid for it yet because eventually we're going to sell it. So you're just, that's what's your in house project. Exactly. Now did Jujitsu take a little bit more of my time than it should have? You know, these things happen. Did I think about it more than anything else in the world? I did. And just real quick, how'd you get into Jujitsu? Well, after football I stopped playing football and I was like, man, I, I need to fight. Like I need to add, you know, I always had this desire to fight. Maybe all men have, I don't know, but I felt like many extra extra like I need to fight. So I'm like taekwondo. So I started fighting in taekwondo and achieved that in about two years. It was like, okay, now what? And then I found Jujitsu and I got choked out by 150 pound kid and I was 285 pounds and I was like, that's a convincer, couldn't figure it out. I came at him with every bit of Athleticism, could choke me out almost cold. I had what just happened and I bought into it.

Speaker 3:          00:42:12       So when he, ah, anyways, I, I was passionate about Jujitsu and I want, I had this perfect plan to build this system and they started getting salty about it. Now is that because they felt like there was an income is because they weren't getting paid by the project getting a commission or something like that? What were they going to salty about? They all got salaries. So what were they getting salty about? The fact that they were working on my pet projects, those words, my pet projects, they were also salty. I had two very young kids and my wife in the office that the kids were in the office and they were, you know, playing with their stuff and doing what kids do. Kids, they're being kids. My company, my office, my kids. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:43:01       They found that a problem. So out of them. Yeah. What was your relationship, cause this, this, I'm just assuming right now that you've got a bunch of people that are working for you that are around the same age as you. Yep. And so I'm guessing that you were kind of broken out with me. We're Super Bros, super burros, super immature, super bros. Immature kids, right? Talented, immature kids. I mean you're talking about like, Hey, let's shut it down and go snowboarding. We've got two inches of POW POW on Sugarloaf, you know, and we need to hit that. That's what we do. We just shut it down, grab the stope wheel. Rossignol would send us like $10,000 in product. We just, we just go out and we'd just rip, rip on the mountain. Hey Man, just get the work done. You know, all you need to, yeah man. No worries. Just do, just make sure the work's done. Yup. Very loose. Super Burros. Yes. Hitting the power to, we call it powder. So yeah, man, the relationship was not a boss, worker, employee relationship. It was a creative, I always wanted to, we had a foosball table in the, in the, you know, give me a break. I mean this is a creative agency. Yup, Yup, Yup.

Speaker 3:          00:44:21       But when shit hits the fan, the fingers go to one person. This guy, right. So, all right, I'm ready to sustain this thing and make it happen. They weren't. So one day I'm in my wife's office and the whole crew gets up and hands me a paper and it's a thick paper and they're like, we'll see you on Monday to talk about this because they thought they weren't expendable. Okay. So they're giving you an ultimatum. Ultimatum. I was like, I turned white for a second. I was like, okay. When they walked out, were you, did you anticipate this at all? No. No idea. I will never be caught off guard like that again. Yeah. That one's going to stick. Now are going to leave a mark. This is a mutiny, you know, straight up. New. Straight up mute. Yep. Okay. My wife is an emotional being. We sat down and we read this, this paper, and it was a list of demands, a list of demands about profit sharing, how the company was making all this money and it wasn't being filtered down to the employees and

Speaker 2:          00:45:38       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:45:38       About my kids and how they cannot come into the office anymore because they make noise, a whole list of demands. They can't concentrate when they're playing foosball. Yeah. Eddie and yeah. Amongst other things. Young, stupid kids. Yeah. And I was one of them. Yeah, because I was naive. So we started looking at this thing and I was just like, wow. It's like getting punched in the face.

Speaker 3:          00:46:10       And my wife went zing and she spun up and shoo. She's French Canadian and she's, she's, you know. Yeah. Anyway, she spun up, I said, okay. Does she speak French when she's angry? No. Okay. I wish that would be kind of hot. If she did, I'd be like, Babe, can you speak French? Just make her mad so she could yell at you and yeah, no. So, so what we did is we just, we sat there and looked at each other and we're like, what? What? And I said, do they have any idea? We just took out a line of credit to support this place to get through the recession. They have any idea, we don't have any work. So what do we do? RECON, we opened up their computers, logged in and started looking for all the interaction between the staff and wow, what they thought of me. I was sad. I was like, wow, this is sad. Maybe you feel like shit, what they think. I mean they thought I was like some type of miser, like, like squirreling away cash and resources because I, because I was, I

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       kept a straight face and hat how happy personality and they had no idea how much in the whole we were. Yeah. And I can imagine that you're trying to actually protect them from the stress and business. Yes. And in doing that, you didn't communicate to them what was actually happening, which meant that they created what was happening in their own minds, which was obviously Raj shit. Them creating what they think reality is in their minds when they don't know all the facts. There's so many times in business when I talk to businesses and businesses are going through transitions or there's something happening and you know, they'll, they'll be asking like, well do you think we should tell you know the employees, what's happening? And I'm like, well you have two choices. You can tell them what's happening or they're going to make up a story to make up a story and it's not going to be good.

Speaker 1:          00:48:16       They're going to think worst case scenario. And so the open communications that is what is how you prevent this kind of thing. And obviously you're 22 years old. That's pretty awesome that you were in a position you earning and obviously you can look back now and it's pretty simple to see what the solutions were. One of them, you were, you were broken out with these guys too much. And this is a fine line, you know, because you know, in a seal platoon, I had Bros, all lifetime brothers that were, you know, three or four ranks below me. But they were professional and they understood the line between and they understood and they respected the position. And, and then there's other guys that were, you know, that same rank, lower rank that I could not, I couldn't give that kind of closeness to. And so that's one of those things that, you know, w w we talk about a lot with companies is it's different for the different people in your company, right?

Speaker 1:          00:49:08       So I'm not saying you can't bro out with people and also that doesn't mean you don't have awesome relationships with your people because that's what you want. You want to have awesome relationships with the people that are working for you because they're going to do that much more for you and you can do that much more for them and it becomes a functional winning team because everyone cares about each other. Exactly. There's a dichotomy there. Are we being there? The lines, are we super burros? What does that, what is that line? That line is the thing that you need to figure out. What makes it really hard with the relationship pieces that it's different for different people. And I had some guys that was an e five and a seal platoon and I was the lieutenant and they were my total bros. And there's another guy that's in e five and I got to keep a little distance just to make sure that they, they stay professional. Right? And so this is, this is challenging stuff and great lessons learned for anyone running a business, especially young people. But it's not just young people. Cause I see seasoned CEOs asking these same questions, learn this shit in college. I'm so sorry. You know, like being an entrepreneur, businessman or woman, whatever it's learned. You know, you may have a gift of something or accounting, you may, maybe a good salesperson are good at marketing or something. Nobody's born with a gift of being an entrepreneur. You know, it's built, it's

Speaker 3:          00:50:27       crafted over time and you have to fail and fall flat on your face and get punched in the face to figure it out. Yeah. So,

Speaker 1:          00:50:35       but what's good is unfortunately there's those like those lessons that your parents tried to teach you but you didn't listen to. And a commando so stupid if you're even aware of them. And that's what's good about like someone that's hearing what you're saying right now. They might not recognize it before. And this is a chapter in extreme ownership, right? Dichotomy of leadership. And you gotta be, you can't be so close to your people. That one's more important that we go through this. But the awareness of it is it gives people a percentage chance of maybe instead of falling flat on their face, maybe they just stumble and they're able to recover. Right? So this is, you know, classic. I fell flat. Yes, dude, it hurt too. Okay. So what happens?

Speaker 3:          00:51:16       So I was, I was sad man at first. Then I got angry and then I got to even, no, no, I basically what it was is w we are not expendable heed these words and these demands and we'll talk to you Monday morning. Okay? So what happens? We do a little recon, get into the computers, see the communication between all of them. What they thought about me, what they thought about my wife, what they thought was going on with a company. Half an hour later I'm in my vehicle and divide and conquer. You're not going to tell me. Cause in that paper said, do not come and see us individually. Do not seek us out. Do not try to separate one of us and have a conversation and that's exactly what I did.

Speaker 1:          00:52:11       By the way, from the employee standpoint, this is a horrible move. They are making dupes as bad of a mistake as you were making as a leader because what they should have, any one of them could have done is said, Pete, Bro, I got to talk to you, man. Let me tell you what's going on. Yeah, this is what we're thinking. We don't know what's going on with a company. You guys working on these random projects that are like your projects, we should be working for other companies. Can you tell us what in God's name is going on so we can move forward? That's what one of those, nobody was that mature and you could have brought them into a room and said, hey guys, I apologize for not telling you, but let me tell you what, what income we have on in the next six months. Nothing. Nothing. So this is what we're going to do. Try and survive you to give them the plan. They would understand why you were doing what you're doing it right and it would have been good. So both sides of the chain of command there are actually making a grievous mistake,

Speaker 3:          00:52:59       bad mistakes. My and I learned from that that that was, I mean I, I'm a transparent person as it is. You can ask me anything you want and I will answer it. I was just a dumb kid though. I didn't want to show weakness to them is what I was thinking. Right. Because I didn't want them to feel like they needed to go find another job. I didn't want him to think that start talking like all the companies going to shut down. I was making my own stories. I didn't trust they would make the right decision if I told them this. So I just carried on to try to push through and you're right. It was a mistake to not share it with them because it would have been, I was, we were bleeding as a company, but they were, the blood I was trying to keep in it would have been easier just to let them decide what they wanted to do after in hindsight, telling them where we were as a company, how the recession had affected us, but I didn't. Yeah, and so I divided and conquered. Meaning I got in my car, drive to the first one's house, knock on the door, John, we're going to talk or you have no job. John's still with me right now. He works for origin.

Speaker 3:          00:54:12       I was pissed. I was so pissed. I was crying a little bit. I was pissed at you were been so pissed. Like you're just like you cried. Yes. Negative next question. Really. I don't know that even when you were a kid it'll be, I mean, I'm like, Oh yes. I guess I guess I'm talking about being a seven. I'm talking like 20 what am I, 2124 something like that. I was in the teams at that point where not crying. Okay. It's not happening.

Speaker 4:          00:54:46       This isn't one time to echo. I'm having a conversation with you. Have you read it? So pissed you like started

Speaker 3:          00:54:56       crying? Honestly, crying is not like anger does not lead to tears in my eyes. For me crying is weakness. Leaving the body.

Speaker 4:          00:55:06       I sad. Okay. I get it.

Speaker 3:          00:55:09       But being angry, that's, that's okay. But you know everyone's a little bit as a kid. Yeah, yeah. No, I was a kid because the kid talk, please remember I didn't have, I didn't have a mentor either. Like when I was a kid I didn't have, I had, I had one mentor, my friend, my, my buddy's father. Cause it was a single single mom. Who was it just we are as kids be a lot of the time we raised ourselves, I didn't have a mentor and having a father figure around all the time to see how to, so I just, I worked off of pure drive an emotion. Yeah. Yeah. And again, I'm not trying to be a jerk. No, I'm having fun with it. But you're so pissed. So pissed. You've got freaking tears in your eyes and you go to John and you fucking, you want this job or not because if you say no, you're not talking to me. You do not have a job and you've got a new house. Okay, so he had, he's in the car. Okay. One down, one down, one in the game. Still in one of the game. Got It. As I drove to the other's houses, they either didn't answer the door and hid or answered the door and said, I can't talk to you and closed it.

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       Okay. These our kids, you know like this kid does, these are kids, which is a good, is a message to everybody. Yeah. When you don't want to talk to somebody, you're not solving anything. You know what I mean? Yes. Now I'm not saying that there's sometimes where I'm so mad at you that I'm like, Pete, come back tomorrow Bro. Cause right now it ain't going to go good. Yeah. I'm so mad I could cry or something like that. It sounds really sensitive, man. What'd you actually do that and that is a week, but that is that. The point is though, seriously, if there's, if there's a problem and you're not going to talk about it, you're going to sound like that kid right there. That answers where I can't, I can't talk to you right now. We can shuts the door. That's not a way to get anything solved.

Speaker 1:          00:57:06       Are there times where you need a little bit of distance because people are hot headed? Yes, that happens. As long as you know you're going to see you both know that it's solvable. You know, like I feel like with respect to business and stuff like, like if you're working with a client, you may like bang heads with a client and be like, all right, listen, we need to, we need to shut this down and discuss it like in 48 hours. That's learned over time. Not when you're a kid. You just want to get after like Ah, forget even your approach was super hardcore and this is again, you know people a little bit aggressive. Yeah. People, people want to hear me say like, that's right. You go in there and you say, you either talk to me now where you don't have a job that was already bleeding though.

Speaker 1:          00:57:51       So was that the right choice? I don't know. But the, the, the, the approach for me would be like, um, hey, let me explain to you what's going on and then you can think more about your decision because right now I'm telling you what you've decided and what you've presented to me is so far off base that if this is what you want to make your decision based on, I'm telling you what I'm going to have to do is let you go because I haven't told you yet, but we don't have any money and I'm paying you out of my own pocket. So if you don't like that and you don't want me to pay you out of my own pocket or anymore, I'm actually good with that. But if you want to have a job and you want to try and make this thing work, let's have a conversation.

Speaker 1:          00:58:29       And that's close to exactly what I would say now. Yeah, exactly. 100% the reason I'm making this point, because I had a guy hit me up on social media the other day, he asked a legit question and, and he pre preface the question, he says, I'm a very direct guy like you, meaning he's direct like me. And he says, and I give feedback and it makes people mad at rubs them the wrong way. And I'm just, you know, I wrote back, I go, look man, I'm direct on Twitter, which is 140 characters and I'm answering 720 questions in rapid fire. And, and so yeah, I'm direct. When someone says, well, what is your, you, what is your average daily diet consist of? Steak. Next part. You know what I mean? But with direct, you're not an asshole. But it's also like I'm having fun. That's the fun part of, you know, interacting with people through social media.

Speaker 1:          00:59:24       That's not how I'm treating another human being face to face in a real relationship. When we're trying to build something, then I'm using tact. I'm using maneuvering, um, quorum, manipulating the situation. I'm setting things up. I'm being the most tactful person. In fact, not only am I not going to rub them the wrong way, I'm going to rub them in a very nice way. So they feel good about the conversation that we had. Disarm them and have a real conversation. The point is, is that you know, you're you, you were like, you said what my little quote was, is what you would say. Now back then, you're young, you're bleeding. I'm bleeding. You're pissed off. Yeah. And you say, you know what wife nagging at me about finances. Yeah. You know how that all builds to young kids don't sleep through the night

Speaker 3:          01:00:08       it gets, it gets tricky and you're trying to maintain this

Speaker 1:          01:00:12       so, so just Fyi that what you just said.

Speaker 5:          01:00:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:00:16       You, you just said you know how it is. And to be honest with you, I don't know how that is because I was in the military. I got a paycheck every two weeks. Yeah. I had kids, I had health insurance taken care of, I had a house taking care of it. It's, it's a huge, it's, it's, it's, it's actually a feeling. I don't know. Um, so I, yeah, don't know that feeling. I want to, I can only imagine. I can only imagine what I would be thinking if I was in your shoes at 22 years old with a wife, two screaming kids, and I don't have any money. So yeah, check. Okay. And yet some, I will tell you about that feeling. It's a feeling I'm never going to go back to as we, as I divided and conquered it did not go my way. So meaning that the people were saying

Speaker 3:          01:01:08       they can't talk or they hid, can't talk to you. They went, they left their having their homes, whatever. So I made a decision what to do when I told him, talk to my wife. She's like, what are we going to do? I said, well, I said, they all think they're expendable except they're not because there's not a person in this world.

Speaker 5:          01:01:32       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:01:33       That is so good. Oh, they can't be recognized, right? Yeah. Okay. Got It. Got It. They think they're not expendable. There's not a person's world that is so good at their job. They can't be replaced. Hmm. Did you hear that echo? Yes, sir. Just just say it.

Speaker 1:          01:01:48       Almost none, but yeah, you're right. You're right. There's a lot of talented people in the world.

Speaker 3:          01:01:55       So what did I do? Hefty trash bags. Get some, I went up to that studio and I scraped their desks individually into trash bags and it felt good. I didn't even mean to say that like, but it felt good. Yeah. I literally just scraped it, tied it up, went to the next, my wife just pushed it all into the bag. This is good therapy. Yup. Yup. We dragged all the shot. I didn't care what was in the bag. I don't care what they had on their desks. My property, your shit in the trash bags. Didn't organize nothing. Just scraped. Dragged him down the stairs gently because I'm getting a feeling this was not as, you're not dragged them down the stairs. We were in this, this like studio, you know, third floor studio that we had built out for us. Beautiful. Right? That Monday morning the art director who I cut my teeth with came down, he lived in Bangor, Maine. We say Bangor came down and we were sitting there and it was glass like the glass and it's like you could see through it being inside, but from the outside you can't, they all got out of the same vehicle, kind of giggling and chuckling like they own me, they own this company and they walked in the door and there we were sitting there with a trash bags and they went from

Speaker 3:          01:03:35       Giddy to guilty to sadness and their faces turned white. There's your shit. Take it.

Speaker 2:          01:03:47       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:03:48       And that was it. Done. That was tough. I said a few words but I was not going to be held hostage to this situation in business. I, I say you've got like 40 years of being a maker. I did a speech recently at an innovation for, I wrote a speech for an innovation expo. It was zero to 20 year learning 20 to 60 you're doing and 60 to 80 hopefully you're enjoying the fruits of your labor. Anything good in life takes 10 years. So my first 10 years had passed but I still had 30 to go and so I knew I wasn't done.

Speaker 2:          01:04:42       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:04:43       But the pain of the situation and the in the experience I grew exponentially overnight.

Speaker 2:          01:04:53       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:04:54       We had salvaged, a small part of the company, which was a s was this, we called it web were right. It was like online software. Like everything is now like the cloud, but there was no cloud, there was this system, I was able to salvage that and because it had like a, a cool little customer base of some high end customers and they paid monthly, it was just like reoccurring payments. Right. Just to use it. Yeah. And so I found a buyer for it and the negotiation took a long time and in that long time we had no income, no money. And so what did I do? I started selling shit, dirt bikes, four wheelers, snowmobiles, every nonessential item I owned got sold, trying to maintain, keeping my home right, which we had built, my wife and I in the forest, which was our dream home, just a tiny little 1500 square foot timber frame, borrowing money from family

Speaker 5:          01:06:05       and

Speaker 3:          01:06:06       and in our parents and them knowing the situation we're in. So them actually just like giving us food or whatever. That whole time I had the maintain like the super composure to try and sell this thing at all. This shit happening in the background and I think it was like eight months and I finally sold it $200,000 I think it was, which was cheap for what we had built. Extremely cheap, but I was in a position where we had nothing left, had freaking nothing left. You know, it was super, super challenging and I could have easily easily turned to substance abuse, which I didn't. I've never been into substances. I could have easily just fell off the deep end and felt like a failure, which I knew I wasn't. My wife wanted me to go find a job. She's like, that's what I was about to say. I can't normal normal day you go get a nine to five. I actually, I can't do this. I can't do this Pete. I can't do this during that eight month stint, you've got to figure it out. Myself paid. I will find a way to make this work and I believe everything happens for a reason.

Speaker 3:          01:07:47       It happened for a reason and I just kept that in the back of my head and I pushed and pushed and pushed forward and it wasn't freaking easy like it was super, super hard like on us, but she stood by me unwavering. She stood by me. Never once did she want to leave, did she not believe in me

Speaker 3:          01:08:24       or not trust me, which is what I needed. And like I said earlier about filling the class back up, it was empty. It was bone frigging dry, bone dry, and she just put a little bit back in and we kept moving and kept chugging. Now during that time period where you're looking to sell the old company, are you hatching plans or is you gotta be 100% focused on just so Moscow and my creativity dove to the bottom of the ocean done. I was, I don't, I've never experienced depression, you know, but I, I I get it. I felt a little bit like a failure. Um, I felt a little bit like a failure, but I knew I wasn't. So every time I had a negative thought, I would just push through it. I just pushed her the thought and what got me through a lot of that was training Jujitsu where I could expel my energy and use my creativity, which I thought I had lost in Jujitsu. It's a very creative sport art and that kind of kept me,

Speaker 3:          01:09:47       I guess it kept those endorphins flowing so I could maintain some stability. But tactically your focus is sell scata gotta make sales, make it look good. Look, let's show them the numbers that are coming in for our few clients. And a lot of projections could be, Yep, that's all you're doing. Yup. That's all you're doing. And you're, you're thinking when you sell that thing, you're going to have enough and you'll figure it out later. But you're not worried about it right now. Exactly. So you make the sale. I make the sale for the first year. We get a monthly check. No, it's like five grand a month or something. Not the full amount, just like five grand a month. So during that time I decided to just take 12 months and figure out what comes next. And in that 12 months I traveled around the country training, Jujitsu and filming a thing we call Bjj weekly because that's what I was passionate about.

Speaker 3:          01:10:49       And so we traveled around and film technique and train and all this stuff and it was like an excuse to train Jujitsu. That's it. This newsletter. And after that 12 months and traveling around, it just struck me what I wanted to do. Years earlier, I had designed this logo for a GE brand off the cough came to me. I get my ideas in the morning. One morning I sat down and just boom, done five minutes. You know, sometimes you can have a client come in. We used use doing, I'd spent a hundred hours on the Friggen logo. You know, people don't realize how much locos costs and sometimes you just nail it like 10 minutes done, finished it just like getting hit by lightning, just boom, done. That's what happened with this origin thing.

Speaker 5:          01:11:44       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:11:45       I wanted to start a brand because what I had done and what I had learned and over that year of driving round and training and reconnecting with myself and my family was that I loved building brands and products. I loved taking something from nothing, like a drawing in making it into something and I had an aversion to the screen.

Speaker 5:          01:12:18       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:12:19       In that space, because of the new media thing, I was always on a screen and I, I just, I told him, man, I, I need to like do something physically, like have something physical and you'd have a physical thing to do because I was an art major and I'm an artist and I zip up goalposts. I needed thing to do. So in Jujitsu I had seen that the, the uniform like hadn't changed. I Dunno, they'd been wearing Kimonos for a thousand years, but you know, judo, you know, hundreds of years did you to a hundred years in Brazil, same thing. Same, same damn thing. A hundred percent cotton uniform. This is what you wear. And I was like, why? Why do you wear the hat? You got under Armour with like wicking stuff and you've got air helmets instead of leather helmets. And you know, just all these innovations in other sports in Jujitsu had shit.

Speaker 3:          01:13:14       We had nothing like wearing a bunch of just straight cotton balls and no sweaty soaked in g that stretches and stinks bad. It's socked in. So to start, I was like, okay, I gotta start, I gotta start. Meaning you, you now the vision, you see that gies haven't progressed, you know that they can be made better. Yup. You, you don't actually eat. And so you say, okay, I want to make the best guy in the world. That's the vision. Yes it is. And you have to start somewhere. You got to start somewhere. So I didn't know anything about textiles, but I knew about design and I knew about the human body. And you know how the human body worked in, in, in, in college sports, you learn about that a lot, you know, mechanics, mechanics of the body, they retrain, knew how to run in college.

Speaker 3:          01:14:07       Like they, you all run the same, you do exercises. So you're all striking, striking with your foot. You all run the same. And so I designed like a g pants and it was like the cowboy cut. Cause I knew that in Jujitsu when you're like you're, you're squatting a lot and on your knees and the material pulled up your up your leg but pulled down your butt. So you're like got plumbers crack, which sucks. So I designed like, so the kneepads came up to your hip, so when you squatted it would pull from your hips, right instead of a cross to the top of your leg. And did, did some cool innovations like that. And then I was like, all right, time to go. So we launched [inaudible] we, we, we, we imported the ski from Pakistan. One G I was in the basement of my house and I was like, we're going to start this brand. So I hit the basement socked. Here comes a g, we shot a photo, we saw some photos off of it and I launched it through Bjj weekly and boom, 40 grand. I was like, wow. Which you didn't have any gies no, none, no keys. But I wanted to prove that we could do something different and I trust that I could make it happen knowing having the keys. I was like 200 yeas sold. I've got something here. I've got something good here.

Speaker 3:          01:15:42       And I knew a new adventure was going to start and my wife's spun up in a positive way. No. Oh. She just like, what are you doing? I'm like, I'm starting a key brand.

Speaker 3:          01:16:00       And she like got sick. Like I know she might had an anxiety attack at first. Like the [inaudible] you can't do this again. You can't, you, you know, you can't start another company. You know? It's like just, and I use this word lightly being around a war hero, like you know, Warrior here, I promise you that PTSD of business, right? That's a real thing. Like she, she, she had like PTSD of business because of what we had gone through and selling everything and the feeling you get that you keep, you keep this feeling. For me, I used it for drive for her. She used it for, I don't ever want to feel that again. That makes me like ill for me it was like I'm never going to feel that again. I'm going to make sure I never feel that again and I'm going to do something about it.

Speaker 3:          01:16:56       So I did it anyways. Started a company origin and that's when it began. 2011 10 or 2000. So how do you start it? You got one, Ge has sold 40 grand worth of one guy that you didn't have. Right. What do you do next? Did you know at this point you wanted to make them in America? Had you figured that part out yet? No. No. I, I, I, let me take that back. I figured you make them an American. I want to be to make them in America. And so I started like calling all the factories and in Maine like, hey, you know, you guys, so stuff. Yeah. Cool. Can you sew this? No. Okay. So it was people, I don't know. Maine has traditionally had a lot of industry up here. Manufacturing big time. Especially when we, when we were kids. Yes. Uh, you know, big brands up here that build a lot, you know, all kinds of stuff. Bashu 10 minutes away, sold out Dexter Shoe, Hayden Shoe, Lou Hayden, he owns San Antonio shoe passed away and huge companies Llb new balance 20 minutes away. So rich heritage and manufacturing,

Speaker 3:          01:18:16       but apparel in Maine, a little different that we made shoes and we a wool fabric and stuff like that. But apparel wasn't, wasn't the norm. So what I did is we are in that basement and we're like, okay, and I just got to make this note that, yeah, the, all those, a lot of those companies that you're talking about that had built all this stuff for, for all those years, a lot of them had left. Yeah. So that, that's the political situation, except all of them had left ll bean. They still make some stuff here. The rest left gone. So bounce, still make some stuff here to write a new balance stuff. Oh yeah. For sure. Yeah. New Balance is awesome. Uh, so

Speaker 2:          01:18:58       yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:18:59       I was like, okay, we're going to make a belt. That's what we're gonna do. We're gonna make a belt. A jujitsu belt. Yeah. Yeah. So there was this guy and Lewiston who ran this company and uh, I called him up. I'm like, I need some sewing machines. And he's like, okay, well why don't you stop by in Lewiston, Maine, one of the manufacturing hubs of main at one time walked in and he's like, what do you need? I was like, oh, this is what I want to make. It's a belt for martial arts. It's like, okay. And I said, I just need some machine, a machine to do that. And like I got 500 bucks cash I can spend on it. Um, can you give me something to practice with? And so he sold me a machine, showed me how to thread the Bobbin, showed me where it went, pulled through the needle and I'm like, okay, okay.

Speaker 3:          01:19:48       We filmed it so we knew how to do it. So we're like filming him doing this. They're like, okay. So we took the sewing machine and then I put it in my basement next to the desk and I'm like, yeah, it's sewing machine. And my wife was just like shaking your head. Luckily, luckily we had sold a preorder, so we had sold $40,000 in keys that didn't exist. So she had gotten off my back a little bit. So that machinery sat there and as we looked at trying to like make this key, and I didn't say, oh, we're going to make a Gig in America. I just said, right, we're going to make, you were going to change the GE. We're going to change the GE first. So we, um, we started the import game. Everybody else is doing it. Everybody's telling me manufacturing's dead.

Speaker 3:          01:20:41       I did a few phone calls pretty much everybody's like, yeah, you can't really do that. And so I was like, okay, you know, and the whole time I'm thinking like something's not right here that I can't do this. And I just couldn't put my finger on what it was. So I imported, you know, in 2011 and uh, may we started in 2011 and into 2012 did a few batches to the whole who you limited edition batch thing. Geez. But we promoted it with the innovations we had. It was still shit. You know when it comes right down to it, what the g was? Yeah man, it was still shit. It's still using old textiles have exist. So you design the, well you said you imported one from Pakistan and then what'd you do? Like cut it up and redesign it or some or did you send the design to them and they can get of soy? I designed like a everything in illustrator, like a tech pack. Like I want this here, I want the knee pads here. They got to fall here, the belt loops because I don't want to untie them all this stuff in and then they send it. Yeah. Done. Yeah. Okay. Finish. So you know, you know in Pakistan, um, they are like the manufacturing for martial arts. It's like the manufacturing hub in this little city called [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          01:22:02       They're actually like a, almost like migrant workers has a ton of factories, Jujitsu factories. But the workers are the same. All the same guys in, they're all the same guys. They meditate or whatever. Rotate around. Yeah. They, we got a contract over here. We're gonna make, yeah. That's going to make her, Geez, good bunch of guys show up there. They work for pennies and pennies. Yup. Yup. So we did the important thing and we started to grow rapidly. We started to make money and at that point, my other business, I was making kind of that monthly income and then I got kind of like a chunk of money, like a hundred grand. I was like, all right, cool. I can like take a deep breath and really push this thing. And so I pushed it and we started selling more and more. Then I came out with this really cool backpack called the [inaudible] backpack, jal backpack, technical backpack. And we sold a ton of them, thousand of them. And then we came out with this product for grip training. We weren't patenting anything, we were just, I was like boom. Cause that's, I did like once I got on a roll, it's like design this, design this. And we were just selling, selling, selling.

Speaker 3:          01:23:13       And during this time I was also competing, you know, cause

Speaker 3:          01:23:19       a male no more each Jujitsu and you want to test yourself against the best in the world. So I was training hard. I'd ended up winning the, the, um, let me, let me digress for a sec. I had seen another company release a product for grip training that looked exactly like ours. What was the product though? It's called, don't know. Ring a hang. So it's you, it's like the g and then color. It was cool. It was awesome. And I was like, those bastards ripped us off. And I wasn't thinking my manufacturer or anything of why I'm psyched man, another company ripped us off. I should have patented that, you know, Blah Blah Blah. Okay. So I was competing. I ended up going to Canada. I won the world pro trials as a brown belt at the time when the world pro trials and the black belt division, cause they, you know, they, they put the divisions together as you know, for that was in 2012 now they, I think they separated them now again, but, so I got to go over to Abu Dhabi and compete in the world pro and as a brown belt in that black belt division.

Speaker 3:          01:24:35       I'm sitting there before my match and I'm supposed to fight, uh, Shawn Gee, how Barrow in the quarter finals of the open division three. And I, I, I'm going to say this, it was bad seating. Like the seating of the brackets was not good. Okay. Um, like I had in my bracket, a guy from Brazil, JT Torres, a shine g and maybe under a golf ball. And so JT didn't want to fight, so he, so I fought the other kid from Brazil and he was much smaller and I was athletic and good and I, I ended up winning and then JT just kind of like didn't want to fight. So then he coached me again, Shawn and we had a war. It was good man. I had last couple of second span. It was very close. Um, [inaudible] multiple time world champion for us. One of the best of all time and Jujitsu. Yeah. Big Time. Awesome guy too. Awesome. Awesome guy. So, but the seating was bad. Like Lovato wasn't in it. Like there was a couple of other guys. I don't know, just it, my division could have been tougher and I would've gotten my ass kicked a lot earlier. Okay. So, but we had a war and it was awesome and maybe I would have won if I had worked harder or maybe I would won

Speaker 5:          01:26:05       if

Speaker 3:          01:26:06       that girl from Poland didn't walk by me right before the match with an origin Gian in a different logo on the back. And what was on your cut of Biggie? Like the gay that you designed. Yeah. And you see a girl from Poland who's competitive competing. She walks by. Yeah, it was, it was actually, uh, it was uh, it was uh, the, the pants. Yeah, it was a pants or there's a logo different low on the back. But our whole thing, you're designed. Yeah. Look, have a different logo. Yup. I knew it was my manufacturer and then everything clicked. They ripped off the Iranian hand grip trainers.

Speaker 5:          01:26:47       Okay. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:26:49       But what am I to do? Because I'm locked into these guys now, so I had to strategize. So I went out and lost in the quarter finals, got on an airplane, worst freaking flight up my life. Cause I'm an Adhd kid and I can't be stuck in a freaking seat for 14 hours. That sucks.

Speaker 3:          01:27:17       And on the ride back I was talking to JT who had become good friends with and he was kind of like in a tricky position in life. He was still with his instructor and Maryland and just didn't know kind of what to do. He wasn't progressing and he's, he was telling me like, man, I gotta I've got to get, like I have to do a full workout before I can actually train with the guys because he was so good. He just wasn't getting it, you know? And you know, the Mecca of Jujitsu, you know, is California ultimately so far as to say San Diego, San Diego, that's where he went to San Diego. That's where he went. So he was figuring his whole thing out. So cal for sure. Soquel yeah, yeah. He was fingering his whole thing out. And Al's I'm thinking about is like this, I'm like, man, how I think I'm gonna build a factory, I'm more on the airplane as that. He's looking at me like, oh yeah, I want to build a factory, screw this shit. This is bullshit. I said, I'm not competing anymore. I'm done. And all she wanted to do is win the world championship. So we kinda like helped each other a little bit in that plane ride back. Like Kinda, you know, bouncing ideas off each other. Decompression, decompression. So I got back and I skyped my manufacturer

Speaker 5:          01:28:42       and I was like

Speaker 3:          01:28:46       over Skype. I'm like, this is bullshit. You freaking, I didn't say that. So you fucking ripped off our intellectual property and sold it to other brands and he said, businesses business. Dang, you ever have a defining moment in your life where you just turn on and you're like, Yup, done. I knew at that moment and what we're going to do. Like it was clear, it became clear and I knew the challenge in front of me and I knew it was insane and I knew it couldn't be done and I was like, it's happening. Props. So, so, uh, I got to tell you a little bit of what happened right after, right after that I went out to the world championships to compete because I had already signed up and that was going to be my year. We were there and there was this brand there and I walked up and I walked by an a, I did a double take. I was like, what? And I looked for the right and there's our Monday, I'll technical backpack right there. But with brand and their logo on it.

Speaker 5:          01:30:11       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:30:13       I went up to the guy and I was like, dude, I said, got any original ideas and everybody, there's a badass except for this guy who doesn't do Jujutsu, who does nothing, right. Just some chubby dude who wants to capitalize on the success of combat sports and Jujitsu's growth in California and I'm not going to name the company. And I was like, that is a week. I said, bullshit. I said, get some original frigging ideas. I went down, walked down and myself and uh, the Deco, our business partner and his wife and my wife were down there and I told my wife in spin, did she ever, she went up there and she flipped out on the guy. If Amanda bringing it, she bringing it five to 103 pounds of fury, French Canadian re fury. Done. It was awesome. We flew back and the picture was already clear. This was just like added motivation, just added motivation. I called one of my buddies, Tim, and and John was already working for me from my last business, the sole survivor, sole survivor moved back to Farmington. What we did is we grab that, like that tape you put around trees and you want to flag trees to cut main, you've got to flag the trees to cut. And we Kinda, I'm like, all right John, I have seven acres of property, which is okay, listen, seven acres is not a lot of property in Maine, right? You can buy property in Maine for $500 an acre in some places, private sale. So let's just make that clear. Seven acres is not a lot,

Speaker 3:          01:32:09       but we have seven acres of land in the woods and so I like flagged out, I'm like, we're going to build a factory here. We just flagged it out like this.

Speaker 1:          01:32:20       And this is based on the architectural design that your engineered put new for your factory. Yeah. Right. I think a factory should be about this big. Yeah, this looks like a factory. His eyes so awesome.

Speaker 3:          01:32:35       And he brought his chains are over and they're just like, all right, let's just do it. And we just, rat rat, rat rat just started cutting trees. My father in law came over with a chipper. We chipped it out. Okay. We stumped it. Would pull the stumps out. We're pretty resourceful up in here in May. He ever had a Yankee ingenuity that term for sure. That happens. So what do we do? We cleared it. We did a little bit of earthwork. I got on the Compact and compact at all the sand and poured a slab. Had had some, some guy, some company, a Sar out a bunch of eastern white pine and had my buddy build, build a barn, factory barn. And we just spent, I don't know, eight 16 eight hour, how many hours you slept and zero hours around the clock. We just built this thing from the ground up myself, my brother, friends, family that would just, we did it. We built it. Sure that we stuck a sewing machine.

Speaker 1:          01:33:40       So when you see that $200 were like,

Speaker 3:          01:33:44       what are we doing? That's where it began. And, and we, you know, the thing is, is like if you listen, I'm, I'm all for planning. Aye.

Speaker 2:          01:33:55       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:33:56       I like to plan the, what's going to happen in that. I like to, like you say, execute it. I like to execute that plan, but do it and I like to lead the plan and I'm, I'm shitty when it comes to like, I'm always making sure everybody's living up to their expectations. Like as part of the plan, if they bought into it, you better fully bought into it. There's no room for like slacking. Like if I'm working till midnight, you're work until midnight, right? You're not leaving. So that's what we did. And I'm a pusher to you, like a push, push, push. I like to see how much I can get out of somebody to push them to their potential and see where their breaking point is so I can learn about the person, but also get the best out of them. So we did it. We built a factory and uh,

Speaker 2:          01:34:47       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:34:48       that's where it started. So then comes what, what's next? Sewing machines. Yeah. And sewing machines and some, as you started looking for staff that knew how sell, yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       exactly. So we didn't have any lights yet. We had one sewing machine and we just like, okay, this is how we're going. This is how you, so, and I found this old timer bill who came down and he's like explaining the different types. He's been in the business for 40 years fixing sewing machines and he's just like, you know when his accent, he's like, oh, you got the single needle machine and a double needle when you've got a locking stitch in a chain stitch and you know all this stuff. And I'm just like, whoa. And so I just absorbed, he became completely absorbed in that right? Learning about sewing machines. I learned how to, how to run them, how to fix them, what they were good for, the different types of feeding, you know, all everything about sewing machines. I was like, cool. I know about sewing machines now we need some fabric. So I started looking for fabric. Guess what? They don't make fabric.

Speaker 5:          01:35:56       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:35:57       In the United States, they don't make fabric that we needed in Mexico. They don't make fabric in Canada. Shit, they don't make fabric for Jujitsu ease. And I was like, what are we going to do?

Speaker 3:          01:36:13       What would you do? You just built a factory and you have all these sewing machines in, what would you do? So you, so your only option at this point is got to order the material from the order, the material from overseas. You got it. That's what you're going to do. Right. I was like screw that. And so I started looking for like weaving and so I just, you know, it was looking for weaving like hey, hey, hey you guys, we've can you use a fire forest? Yeah. A hundred thousand yards, you know, 12 bucks a yard. No. So I'm just looking, looking, looking, looking, and did you ever order any material? I did. Okay. Because you had to sell gies. I mean you had to make some money. You got to investment into this thing now. Right. And I did, I had, I didn't pick it. Take a paycheck for like the first two years of business. I didn't take a paycheck, maybe three. I didn't pay myself once every dime. I just dumped back in, dumped back in dumped back in weaving was impossible. Right. You're not in a freaking we material. So I did, I imported material for that first year and we, we figured out how to make a g and it was a pain in the ass. And that first week,

Speaker 3:          01:37:37       well we finished the week and I called to deco and I said we made five pairs of pants this week

Speaker 3:          01:37:49       and he's like, really high production dude. I was just like, what am I doing? And I kind of start telling that story. You like legit, we're questioning. Oh I spiraled down like, oh my God, you didn't, you thought you were going to make 200 g's in a week and he or de Pants and weekend you make five, five, five pairs of pants. I was just mind boggling, mind boggling. And Jill was my first teacher. She's still with us today. The one you were talking about earlier. Yeah, dude, I did not know what to do. I was truly at a loss for, I didn't have anybody do. They teach me about how to manufacturer, like how you should set this up because the knowledge had disappeared out of the state. It was gone. The folks that used to do that stuff, either they've passed or there they've moved on, they're snowbirds, they moved to Florida, whatever, they weren't around. So I had a lot of late nights by myself in my basement with a glass of whiskey. I started to have that feeling come back of that like failure feeling and I didn't know what to do as like what did I get myself into, you know, like what, what are you doing? Like how do you, what am I doing?

Speaker 3:          01:39:34       And then I figured like I cannot basically like I can't do this alone type of situation. And in a conversation with my father in law's like Joe, man, I need to talk to somebody who's like been there and done that and like done, built something from nothing. And he's like pds. Like, I've got a friend that he did some work for in his bulldozer by and finalize a heavy macra repair machinery mechanic. And so we made a phone call to this guy, John, I'll leave his last name out. And John said, yeah, I'll meet with Pete. He said, here's the date and time. Meet me at my Lake House. So I showed up at his Lake House and I sat down and he shook my hand and he said, let me tell you something, you're not fucking special. Now I'm already Pete down. Just I'm using his words and you're not fucking special. Your ideas aren't special and nobody gives a shit. How's that? Okay. Motivational speaker getting after it. You nobody gives a shit. Yup. I said reality check. Yeah. I was like, Oh shit. He goes, what's your problem? I said, man, Aye. Aye. We need money to like, he was like, no you don't. I said, no, we need, we need, we need money to, to like do this, to like learn how to do this and build this and like make this happen. I need money. The capital.

Speaker 1:          01:41:15       He goes, Pete w were you in the back of your mind thinking you had good capital investor right here is a big gala, the lake house, and maybe this guy's going to throw to tgs at, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:41:25       nope, I wasn't there for financial,

Speaker 1:          01:41:30       uh, financial, uh, I wasn't looking, but that was the solution that you saw. You didn't come from him. You just thought, I need money for this thing, only solution.

Speaker 3:          01:41:40       I need money. And as he kind of like beat me down and this guy ran like a 50 [inaudible], I think they're $100 million company now. At that point it was $50 million and he was kind of retired and doing his thing and giving his time to me for free to help another kid from industry main succeed.

Speaker 3:          01:42:06       He basically educated me in two hours, educated me and I walked away from that meeting like with a plan, a plan of action. What was like, what was the, the big takeaways he told me I need to basically find out who I was and do a personality profile. Uh, and he goes, you're probably what he say. N, I, N, f, j, something like that. He like guessed it. Um, or an I an Ega. I'm not even exactly sure what it was. So I did my personality profile to find out my strengths and weaknesses and it was spot on. I was like, Holy Shit, this is added like crazy. And uh, then he told me, you're not all in, you don't really want to win at this. I was like, no, I do. Then go all in. How much do you believe in it? Because there's a million frigging people like you. He said there's a million people like you and a million great ideas and less than 1% are willing to go and chase it and go all in and do it.

Speaker 3:          01:43:29       Are you one of those people and if you are, solve the money problem and solve the rest of the problems. The next day I was at the bank signing my home away with my wife by my side. She was stoked for a $200,000 loan. That was tougher. Her two things as you were saying them, there's a big difference. You put them together, which is when you put them together, it makes sense. But chasing your goals, chasing your dream and being all in does not in the same, not the same things. Now, now if you're all in and did, you have to chase it. You, you don't even know what else to do besides chase it. Right. But I think some people, they, they chase it, but they're running like half speed. Yep. And I was a half speed. Yeah, it's awesome. You gotta be uncomfortable. That's basically what I took away from that. And he's the one that told me, he said, Pete, how old are you? I said, I'm 30 what's your problem? I said, I'm going to get John on the podcast at some point. I'm stuck. Yeah. I said, I was stuck. He goes,

Speaker 3:          01:44:45       you got three more chances. He's like, I'm 60 you got three more chances. He's like, if you believe in it. And he's the one that told me everything in life. Everything great takes 10 years to build, go build it and be committed because it's got to take 10 years to build it. But if you believe in it, you have to go all in and if you got to put up your house, put up your house, you'll work your way out of it eventually. So that's what I did. I followed his advice and I went all in. He also told me, the moment you stop growing, you die. He said, if you stop growing, you will die. The moment you want to do something different than what you're doing, the moment your mind wanders to wanting to be somewhere else, your business also dies and you need to recognize that. And that first meeting with him was just, it just changed my, changed my game and when I signed my name on that loan, when I signed my home to the bank to receive that check, I was laser focused. It's like being in the woods on an early morning hunt when it's dark and the sun is coming up in the and the and the and the leaves go right as the sun hits the leaves, it's the trees and you're waiting right for the deer, for whatever you're hunting. That's what I felt like about business. The same feeling you get from that. I felt laser focused and it's like everything just opened up like my mind opened, like the synopsis connected and I was at like a new Pr, a nuance. I was noo.

Speaker 3:          01:46:52       That's what I mean by like you can't hear when was born an entrepreneur. You're not born an entrepreneur. You need to get punched in the face. And John Punched me right in the nose. It was awesome. So the next step is

Speaker 1:          01:47:09       you order some material, but that's not your longterm plan. Right? And, and the next thing you do is you go, we got to make this material more skills. We've got to make the material.

Speaker 3:          01:47:21       I had called every use textile company in the United States, every use textile company to try and find this machinery. We had to weave our own fabric. It wasn't a sustainable model without waiving our own fabric. They're all like, it's just not going to happen. I'm like, what is it to get set up million dollars, right? 750 grand.

Speaker 1:          01:47:54       This is to buy a brand new loses the by Lou, the operational experience in there. And they're going to send you from the factory after they build this loom, they'll send you a guy that's going to help you run it all set up is that we just need $1 million. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 3:          01:48:07       It's just not going to happen. So I was like, okay, in business it's like boxing. Like it's like Jujitsu. It's all about the angles. You know when people get so stuck on like one angle, they could only see that one angle and I just had to like I the step to the side and I had to see this angle.

Speaker 3:          01:48:30       I knew Maine had a heritage and weaving. I knew there was weaving here at one point and so I went back to that same old timer in Lewiston, Maine who had sold me my first sewing machine and I sat in his office and I said, no, where there aren't any looms. It's like, what do you mean? I'm like a weaving loom, like to weave fabric. He goes, get in my truck. I get in his truck, we drive up one street and get out and this is massive building. It's like, uh, I think total square footage was like 1.5 million square feet low, mostly abandoned a few businesses in the front that they've refurbished and there's a museum there

Speaker 3:          01:49:24       and in walks in and he introduces me to this woman Rachel, and he says, Rachel, this is Pete. He's looking for a loom. And she goes, well, follow me. She made me sign a release. We went up the stairs and into this old mill five and the floorboards, the windows were all broken. The sawtooth building, you know the saw tooth mill buildings and windows were all broken and the wood was all punky and like, like all bent up and splintered. You had like watch where you're walking and there's this big green nasty thing sitting in the middle of the floor right there in this whole place. And we walk over to it. She's like, I need to get rid of this. And I'm like, this is a whom he, she's like, Yup. I said, Holy Shit. Where's the rest of them?

Speaker 3:          01:50:27       They shipped them overseas. Company in India bought us, bought about automile and they shipped everything overseas and she goes, I kept this one. I kept it here because I wanted to put it in the museum, so we didn't lose our heritage day. I said, can I buy it? And she said, Yep. I said, how much? She had 3000 bucks. I said, okay, done men, and this is it. Like I just want to point this out. The the, the, the floor is all broken. The windows are broken and the loom is like rusty, right? Oh Dude, this is not like this. This thing is disaster. When's the last time it was used? How many years ago? Oh, eighties it was, it's an 83 it's like a 1983 I don't know when the last time it was used, but it hadn't been, had any love for a long, long time. Most of the parts were stripped off of it. It was like a frame, just like an infrastructure. I said, okay, I'll buy it. I'm going to buy this loom. Yeah. So you've got to be a little bit naive to be in business and think you can accomplish anything. That's the bottom line. And I was pretty, pretty driven and naive to think that we could weave fabric, but I believe that we could.

Speaker 3:          01:51:54       So she sold me it and then I called my father in law and I said, I got a loom, it's on the third floor of this old mill in Lewiston, Maine and we need to get it out. And I got a quote on moving in and it was $25,000 to move it. And I'm like, we're gonna move it. And he's like, okay. So I've got a bunch of friends. We went up there, took nine guys, eight hours to move it from the middle of the floor to the edge of the building. And we had another friend who had a crane and we ended up getting it out and onto a trailer and put it in the factory. And then we were like, why are we do dear? And it was awesome. It was awesome. So that's where it started. Uh, you know, it's, I always believe like

Speaker 3:          01:52:57       if it was done, it can be done. Like if it, if, if you know, in Maine we have this thing, like main at one point was 90% field. How to become 90% fields, you know, a hundred years ago. Hands and daylight, hands in daylight, right. How were these mill buildings built? Hands and daylight. That's it. These people they got after it. I mean, why? Because if you don't, you die. That's it. You're going to die. So you've got to farm, you've got to know how to build a house. You got to know how to start a fire. Like that culture of New England is still rich, you know, it's still passed down. We burn wood. Everybody Burns. Would we build our own shit, you know, houses, everything. That's what we do. Why is everybody saying we can't manufacture? We can't. We've, we can't cut. And so that's bullshit. If they did it, we can do it. Cause they did it with a lot less. I found a guy, Lenny, when that mill shut down, he had a contract to go over to um, Pakistan, Pakistan of all places to teach them how to run the looms that were purchased in a month later was nine 11 and he didn't go and he stayed here, thank God because he's the last, he's like the last one left that can actually get this thing going and make it work again.

Speaker 3:          01:54:44       I asked [inaudible] how many people know what you know? He said a whole bunch. I said, well, what's a whole bunch? She's like five. So he, Lenny passes knowledge on US weaving pattern making for textiles and all this stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:55:07       And that's a whole nother story maybe for different time. But we started weaving fabric and we became vertically integrated and we started making the product from raw cotton from what did it feel like the first time that thing created? Created like fabric. You must've dude. He was freaked out. We were just like, he's just like, uh, we had the, we had like the pack, like we had to make Pearl we've, and so we did, we made pro, we would like took the up pro we've apart that was like from the imported fabric is like we just picked it apart and Lenny looked at it and figuring out what size threat, you know, yarns and the weight and everything. So we just recreated it and he turned it on for the first time. You know how long it took to clean that thing, 40 man hours to clean it. Like it just, it need cleaning before we did anything cleaning, then we had the buy it, all the parts are out of a machine and just to get it going again. He turned it off for the first time and it was like,

Speaker 2:          01:56:07       well,

Speaker 3:          01:56:13       and I looked at John, my employee, John and Lenny and I said, Holy Shit. And then, and there comes and it's just, and there's a pearl. We've coming off the loom, man, it was so exciting. I was like, nobody's ever done this. Nobody's ever done this. And it was, I was super proud. I was like, we're, we're fricking doing it. We are doing it. And then we announced it to the world. We thought we still got a lot of work to do, but, uh, now we announced it to the Jujitsu world.

Speaker 1:          01:56:54       That's it, man. That was it. How do I even want to tell you the challenges after weaving? I do color this though. Sold, like I was telling you before, when, when I was in this SQL teams in the early nineties, yeah, we didn't have the custom gear, right? You couldn't buy this stuff on the Internet from these tactical companies. Right? So we made stuff and we had, we had parachute riggers, which are the people that pack parachutes, but in a parachute loft you've got a nice medium duty and sometimes a heavy duty sewing machine. And so we would make our own gear and, and us guys, like we would kind of get into it a little bit and I, you know, I had us, a lot of seals would have their own, um, you know, sewing machines and you know, you'd make gear and some people would be good at it.

Speaker 1:          01:57:39       Some people get really good at it. And I was not one of those people and it, because, you know, there's these little threads and you got to get these things working right. The fifth bullet through the, because all this stuff. Yeah. And so, and every time I'd like to start sewing it would just fall apart. Or like a bird's nest and just mayhem. And when I see like the loom, yeah. With it looks like stress you out. 1 billion is coming through these little things and, and therefore wing through. And then you look on the other side and all that craziness. There's like these hundreds of thousands, it looks like little pins that are moving and things that are pulling apart. It's crazy. And then it comes up you other side and you see this pattern. Yeah. And He makes me, it actually does stress. Yeah, I see it.

Speaker 1:          01:58:26       I go, man, I, I can't be in here for two logs. I'm freaking out. Just thinking if I get too close to these things, oh yeah. My, my presence will cause disturbances in the forest and things will go wrong. I'm not allowed to be in there for very long. I like, I'm not, I'm, I've got to, I've got an issue, you know, a subliminal issue with threads. And so I keep, I even today I said keeping a little distance from the machines. I don't want to foul him up. You guys have the magic, like stayed away from that. But yet to see that and, and to even imagine it like, you know, again, as a novice person working with a sewing machine as a young kid, the how hard it was for me to do it. And then like I was watching Julietta Wham, wham, Wham, just hammering, you're just, it's like such a good craft, such good skill to have and, and just to see the loom and all those different parts, you're saying yourself.

Speaker 1:          01:59:19       Well for one thing like good luck, like somebody wants to do what we're doing. Go. Yeah, do it. You have fun with that one. Not Happening. But by the way we bought the last loom switch. You're screwed. Yeah, absolutely. And the last bit of knowledge with six, which exists. Yeah man. And so then you know, you, you take and you start weaving it and now you starting to sell gies and how's business going now? Now you're able to put on something made in the USA 100% and that's from the dirt to the shirt. Yeah. Code Rod rod already dirt to shirt. Right. I mean because field to finish because the cotton is coming from Tennessee Delta region, Tennessee spun in the Carolinas and shipped up to us. That's like the, that's old school fricken right. It is the way it's supposed to work. Hats, old school making shit. You know. I mean I talked today a little bit at our grand opening about like

Speaker 3:          02:00:25       Mainers generations of folks that put their hands on something right there makers, they need to make something in. They're trying to cross train these people to type on a computer, you know,

Speaker 1:          02:00:45       do mundane office type of tasks, filing papers, answering the phone and call centers. These people want to make shit. We're known in Maine for being some of the best crafts people in the world. The products that come from Maine or some of the best products in the world.

Speaker 3:          02:01:08       And to be part of resurrecting that heritage is, it's incredible, you know, and it is our ultimate mission, you know, to resurrect our heritage in manufacturing

Speaker 1:          02:01:23       and build old world level quality the

Speaker 3:          02:01:27       products and stand behind it, stitch every, stitch, every, every yarn in the,

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       and that's what we're all about. And that's what origins stands for with a little bit more modern look and feel. But sourcing and manufacturing 100% in the u s and I, we won't compromise on that at ever. Like other companies do when they get greedy and they say, well, it's time to look at the numbers. It's time to increase the margins and we got to import some of this stuff. Nope, we're not. We're just not doing it. It's just not happening. I was in at bath iron works for the awesome, the Christening of the USS Michael Mont store, obviously named after Michael Monster War. And it was awesome for me. You know, I, I enlisted in the navy from that down in Portland and to come back 26 years later and see what you're talking about, what I knew existed in New England in Maine and, and seeing the pride that these, you know, ship builders, the iron workers that did the pride that they took in that ship named after a saint of a human being.

Speaker 1:          02:03:05       And you know, that's one of the things that I tied to origin cause I knew what you were doing up here. Yeah. And um, you know, to kind of get to how we ended up joining forces. It's funny because you know, you were just some guy, you know, some crazy guy up in Maine in my opinion that I'd, well I'd seen a couple of your videos and I've seen it. I see a dude, you know, you have the video that shows you pulling this freaking loom out of this factory. And I'm just thinking to myself, this guy is insane and I think I like him and I had actually, the funny thing is for my gym in San Diego, victory MMA, I wanted to make Jujitsu gies in America and so I was like, okay, this, I looked around, I find one guy that's doing it, it's you w w like three or four years ago, we went back and forth on email and you know, nothing ever came of it because I was busy.

Speaker 1:          02:04:02       You were busy and just nothing happened, but I always just remember, hey, you know what? This guy up in Maine, he's, he's, he's doing what? He's doing it the right way. And what happened was the weight we actually got connected was I was on a Facebook live just talking to people and someone says, what kind of, Gee should I get? And I just rattled off. I go, hey man, if you're going to, if you need a g, you're starting Jujitsu or you're good at Jujitsu or you just want a good gee, I go get a Guinea from origin origin main.com. I go get a gift from there. I go, this crazy guy up there, he a Lou, I can't say it without laughing because it's so pretty. I'm like, he took a loom out of uh, out of a broken factory and he refurbish that thing with his team and they built, you know, they're doing it, they're building it.

Speaker 1:          02:04:48       So if you need a key, I said I'd try and talk to this guy cause I had, I had reached out to you a couple of times of, through various, even since the time I asked for, for uh, Jeez, I'd said sent you an email or something. And I said, you know, I'm trying to talk to him. If anybody knows this guy, his name is Pete. I go tell him I said, what's up? And this awesome woman that listens to the podcast, her name is Sarah Armstrong, and she's super squared away, you know, a professional with a, with a big company. And she, you know, she had communicated me with the various things over the, over the past year that I've been doing the podcast and whatnot, and for, she said, Oh, I'll take that for action. And she contacted, she contacted you, called me. And what'd she say?

Speaker 1:          02:05:37       She just said, uh, you basically, she's like, have you heard of this guy? Jockowillink and dude, I'm sorry. I had my head up my ass for the last five years trying to build this factory no factor. And I was like, you're like, who? Oh, and then so you know, what do I do? I dig. I'm like, Holy Shit. I'm like, this guy is making some waves. This is awesome. And so, uh, I did a little recon and then I reached out to after that. And what's awesome is I had no idea what we were going to do. Yeah. Um, you know, we went back and forth couple of times on email and then finally you're like, hey man, let's, let's just go to Skype, right. Let's do Skype. Because we'd been, I today, you know, when you want to do something, you're like, I want to do somebody want to do. I'm like, well, let's pick, you know, figure it out. Send me an email about this. You're like, how about we do a Skype call? So I have my meetings, like scheduled, I'm working all day. Sure. And I blocked two hours. I'm like, you know what, this is probably going to take awhile to get this conversation going on about two hours or we're just going to get on Skype and make this happen or figure out what we can do. So we ended up talking on Skype for four hours, talking, laughing, talking, laughing, yelling.

Speaker 1:          02:06:55       After I got off, my wife goes, it sounded like you were talking to you. That's not good. She was a little scared and uh, and it was just, you know, it was, it was awesome for me. It was, you know, the things that I believe in as, as an American, as a person, as a new Englander, it was like a, you had the thing that I didn't have, right? Like w you know, for instance, we're, we're, we're making things, we're building things, but we don't have vertical integration. We don't, we didn't, we weren't, we weren't doing it the way I want to get it done and so, you know what I'm saying? Hey like join forces.

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       Absolutely. And from my perspective, of course I was like this dude is for real. I was like, I would already told my wife. I was like, man, this guy, he's on another level and we, we had been like looking for somebody, I remember talking with the Deco and the psych in too. It's like Ah, you've got all these world champs and then you have like the flavor of the month guys with like a fancy Jujitsu stuff and we just, it just was never part of our plan to sponsor Jujitsu world champions. Right. Because what we were trying to build is like much bigger than that. It's like, man, we've been talking for like a year. Like we need to, we need to find somebody or partner somebody with somebody that like represents origin through and through in multiple ways. This is impossible. You, we will not find this person. It's not possible. And then

Speaker 1:          02:08:39       you're, you're, you were, we were talking to earlier today, this was, this was classic because I didn't remember this. So for those of you that know anything about negotiation, whether you're negotiating a car purchase or whatever, one of the things, one of the tactics of negotiation is you don't give a number first. So if I want, if, if echo wants to buy these sunglasses, he says, how much are these? I don't say they're 10 bucks. Cause what if he was willing to pay 20 right? So, so, you know, if, if he says, how much of these I go, well, you know, what are you willing to pay for him? And then he should say, well, you know, I don't know. What are they worth to you? And so Pete and I had the textbook. It was, it was more than that though, because it was, it was the strategies is like, what are you gonna do while you've got to, you've got to devalue or show value me.

Speaker 1:          02:09:25       So going back and forth, well, well, yeah, well, yeah, yeah. But you know, it's like, you know, back and forth, battle, battle battle. And then I caved. They did. So we were trying to figure out the value of whatever, if something and, and I'm like, well, Geez, you know what? Like, you know, just give me, I mean, what if you had to, what would you, what would you say a number of eve of that? And, and he's, you know, he's gives me x and I didn't remember doing this, but he told me that. And then I remembered as he says, you know, the value's probably x and I went to your weekend spoken. We both started laughing because we've been playing the game was like, actually that is what, like both, I think both of us realized we were just let, let's just get it, let's do this.

Speaker 1:          02:10:10       But actually, you know, I'm busy. You're busy. Yeah. And so we, and we actually, we both definitely got along. We, we, I mean, I think both of us felt really solid about the other person, but we didn't quite figure out how to, we couldn't figure out how to make this work. Yeah. You know, he's got something that he's put years of blood, sweat and tears into. I've got something that I've been doing. My life has been to get to here and so we just couldn't quite figure out, wow, this was going to work. So we just, you know, we kept in touch a little bit of conversation over the next couple months and then I knew I was going to Maine. You, you, you can I gotta ask you something now? Yeah. Do you, you knew you were coming to Maine. I knew you were coming to Maine. Neither of us. Like we didn't text back and forth until the last minute because I knew the date you were coming to Maine. Uh Huh. Did you, were you planning on a meeting when you came to Maine the whole time are definitely knew we needed to meet. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:11:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:11:17       He's like, you were icing me, be on ice. I thought I was putting you on ice. We were both on ice. Yeah. So that was an oil is it? That was like the meeting. Who Will, awesome. When we met up in Portland, uh, we had dinner. We actually both brought our wives and I and I, my wife is always too busy to do anything business wise with money. So she was super stoked to even be around and meet a man and everything. And you know, you, we sat there are wives don't even know what they were doing because you and I were just in the zone and, and at the end of the night we figured out and we shook hands on it and I knew right there we were good. We, we, we crafted the deal. That was awesome. Yeah, it was awesome for both of us. It was awesome for everything that both of us want to achieve. And it did. He turned into not even both of us started to us. Exactly. And that was awesome. And I think one of the best, like lessons learned from, from me, what is just an incredible opportunity. That's how I see opportunity in crafting a deal is making sure that you're both getting what you want in your both a little bit uncomfortable so that you continue to

Speaker 1:          02:12:38       feel a little bit of the struggle to make sure you can take it over the goal line. Right. You're too comfortable, you'll become complacent, bite off a little more than you can chew and you're going to be chewing for much longer. So that's, that's something that was important. It was awesome. Yeah. Ed. So just so everyone knows, I mean know I've been saying it like we're partners, you know, we're, we're partners with, with the podcast in what, what echo and I had been doing for the last couple of years and what origin been has been doing for the last five years? Seven years. Four, five, five years. Six years. Yeah. Six years. And at the end of the night when we got done eating our steaks in Portland, Maine, uh, we shook hands and, and this whole, you know, you've described it as like a perfect storm, which is what it feels like to me.

Speaker 1:          02:13:31       Hey Man, I was born in Gloucester. There you go. It is the perfect score. Go. You got, we are the perfect storm. Yeah. Um, and, and so that's what's going on is that you don't, now we've got this and we joined forces and, uh, that we, we both compliment each others, you know, in, in terms of our business, we compliment each other's weaknesses in terms of our personalities. We compliment each other's weaknesses and WWE were, and the best part about it is the whole time that we're doing it, we're actually laughing our asses off at each other and having a great time, which is, which is what it's all about. So that's where we're at. That's why we're here, by the way. That's why we're here. By the way, in Farmington, Maine, in the origin factory, 20,000 square feet, we're going to end up with how many employees in here in a year? How many employees were going to have in here? Oh, probably in a year. I don't know. 30, 40, 50. I mean, somewhere in there, you know, between 30 and 50. That's in a year by, remember this is a start. We're starting.

Speaker 1:          02:14:38       And so in five years we're going to have a lot of people. Oh yeah, we're and people ask, what are you going to make? Everything. And I say, we're gonna make everything. Everything that I use in my life, I want it made here in America, from the shorts to the hats, everything. And that's what we're going to do.

Speaker 1:          02:15:02       Beanies, uh, probably pants, pants. You know what? I was at a store the other day, uh, you know, like a hardware store, but with a big one where they sell work clothes. And I said to myself, you know, let's just, cause obviously I'm thinking about this all the time now, you know, it's hard, hard to look at work clothes and you say, of course, American workers, they would want to wear American made clothes. Were these clothes made? They're not made here. And then I made American and they're not made by American hands. Um, so I think we're going to be in a take no prisoners scenario and we're going to Jay after it went on. I just kind of take no prisoners. We're going to chase the big dogs.

Speaker 1:          02:15:45       He'd look out, listen and look out. And that's not, that's not like an ego thing. That's the truth. Yeah. Listen and look out. Yeah. And like I said today, when, when you, when you rekindle the fire now of manufacturing and the, you rekindle, I mean, just talking to talking to the employees here, this is what they want to do. 100% and this is what they made to do. That's right. And like you said, they want to take these things and build them with their hands who got it. And that Opportunity's been taken away in the last 25 years and we're bringing it back and that is awesome. Appreciate that. Glad to have you as part of it. Awesome.

Speaker 6:          02:16:32       That's what we did. Echo Charles Right now, my brother, speaking of what we do. Sure. Why don't you do what you do. I have a question or you ask a question. Do you find it poetic that the origin logo is that circle? Remember when you were getting shit from the politician? It's funny. No, never thought about that. Now you have an origin logo. That's a circle.

Speaker 2:          02:17:04       Okay.

Speaker 6:          02:17:05       It is a bill. That kinda in and of itself is like a circle. It's actually, it is a wave. It's a, it's actually like a rip curl wave. Is that what that logo is? The is the flow. Did you Jitsu flow? The surf flow? The store. It's a wave is what that is. And that's what breaking symbolic is. What they'd call it. I'll just say ironic, but that's not ironic cause symbolic. Symbolic. Symbolic. So yeah. Oh no one even remembers that. I don't even remember who that politician was. It doesn't even matter. Nope. They're going to know what that origins dry in the industry or we call that layers. True Story. Anyway, speaking of layers. Got It. And support by the way, support this podcast and yourself.

Speaker 2:          02:17:52       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:17:52       Origin main.com. Speak of the devil. That's how you could support. Yeah. So good to know. What do we got geese. So that's the thing from the beginning. People ask what's the key to get? We know, we don't know. It's hard to 100% now. Hundred percent. You know, he had like a hierarchy. You know, he only has one genome, but you have multiple selections though. Yeah. So they do absolutely. Boom. Edward, we're about to like blow up our manufacturing. Um, and this new factory again, grand opening today. Lots of product coming right on the east side of stuff. Ramping things up over the next, what time frame we've started ramping, uh, over the next four to six, four to eight weeks. Let's say we're going to be hiring another 16 people. We put another loom in the factory. So there's just three looms now and we're going to be weaving Ninjas. Like, like super real. It's like I, I mean I didn't want to elaborate. You just come, come to Maine and see, yeah. Anytime in the factory. Come check it out. I like it. When are the shorts coming out that I'm wearing? Oh boy. Cause they're straight up. My best short now we're going to make it happen.

Speaker 6:          02:19:15       Well Hey, I get that all the time. Hey, when is the, you know, Xyz coming out. Hey, so now it's on you a little bit, you know. But yeah, these are straight up the best shorts though. It's not actually that hard for you because people say when's that next? Oh, you're talking about the, the the gear side. Yeah, the merchandising side. And I do believe that it might be a little bit more work on pizza and compare it to on my end a little bit. But Hey, I don't know from a, from a, if you go from like the level that you're currently cruising at, maybe you both have to travel the same distance it relative to the work done, relatively speaking. I think you're right. And yeah, but not just geese, right? No, no. We bunch of, you know, apparel, everything is, you know, like our t shirts or knit.

Speaker 6:          02:19:58       Like we have a partner that knits, knits all the fabric like six hours away or something. Everything's, everything's sourced and made here. We make all our own compression apparel like cotton. So sublimate dye sublimation, everything you say. Compression apparel. Yeah. I still call it a rash guard. It's a rash guard. I know. I'm just, because I know it's not just a rash guard. This rash guard is for surfing. Right. But, but, but like the, like, like the, we still call it in the Jujitsu community, don't we still say? Yeah, I got a new rash guard. Oh yeah. Well he's still saying that. I'm just making sure, cause I wasn't like hearing someone at the gym saying like, did you check out this new compression on the weight room? They do say that. Right. I see. Like in football. Football, yeah. Like you'll see some company that's advertising compression gear.

Speaker 6:          02:20:47       Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. And I'm like, Oh, you mean a rash guard trying be on me. You got to remember like every textile is different than what you're used to. Like, like the warp wit we use are our textile for the rash card or tights or whatever else is different. And you just called him tights? I did because spats, I have no idea what a SPAC is going to say out in California. It's definitely called spats, spats. And I don't even know where that word comes from. Spat. I knew spats is when you tape your ankles, you spank your leg. I bet you, I bet you wait, did this spats go down your leg like tights and it around your foot? Just tape over it. He just take, but instead of your ankles under your socks or whatever, if you take over everything over your shoe, over everything, trainer stopped doing cause it's, so why don't we call him compression pedal?

Speaker 6:          02:21:42       Cause I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be, you know, earlier we got kind of like wrapped around or we got sidetracked about me being sensitive about something or not being sensitive tights. You're not down for 10 a dude. Right? We're not wearing tights, not happening. Pants come. Compression pants. That sounds good. Compression shirt. See their ego compression shirt, compression and rash pants, rash guard pants. That doesn't make sense either. Does it, even though they do prevent rashes or did you get to met burn these? You know why people, you know why a lot of people wear compression pants and compression shirts in Jujitsu, the prevention of the disease, the funk, right? They don't want the hing horn, right? They don't want that to hit one reward.

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       They don't want, you know, whatever. Various Bursa and so people wear that and the people that I know that where it, they seem to believe in it. Oh yeah. Just the level of, it's not like, uh, like the, what's the sun protection bringing pf last 50 or UPF UPF yet UPF 50. There's no anti ring warm percentage rating. Right, right. There's the general end time. My crew will Beall. Right. Like certification and that keeps it from growing in the material. What I'm saying is if you were like a compression shirt and compression pants, sure. Then you're not rubbing your skin against some savage that came into the gym or have ringworm, so you have less percentage with him too. But yeah, we're rolling. Put a triangle on his ringworm on his or something like this. Yeah, you don't need that, so you don't want it. That's a good reason to wear compression gear ration card across the board and the rash guards are there now.

Speaker 1:          02:23:27       They're not like the rash guard. You're used to the ones you put on and then they on talk and then you talk about it in the on talking and talking man. They're designed to stay tucked in so you put them on and the way the fibers flex and bend with your body. It's not your mothers or grandmothers rash garden. So when, when you say tucked in because you don't really tuck in a rash guard, right? Or do you? You're talking about under the Ghia. Okay. Oh yeah. That's, that's a whole new world right there. Yeah. Some places make you wear rash guard under your G. Oh, okay. Yeah. I think it's good to have a rash guard in here. I know a lot of people think that it's not traditional. I mean I misread dish. Yeah. In that one.

Speaker 1:          02:24:10       I liked the barrier. I liked the, I liked the key or the, I liked the barrier, um, between the, the, the fabric and the skin. I like to compression because you compress your muscle, you get more use your straight performance performance. Yup. Got It. Absolutely. The key slides a little bit better on a rash guard than it does your skin once it's all sweated up and sticky. So that's why he use it. And um, I Harry Creek too. Nobody wants a chest hair space. That's right. They don't want that. You know, would be happy if we all wore rash guards. She's our black belt at our gym, female and she is still a girl. So things like chest hairs. Yeah. She's not happy about those. Those, she begs me to where you don't something under my gate. She's so far failed. Failed on my grown man.

Speaker 1:          02:25:06       But um, you know, the other thing is you, we didn't talk about origin main.com is supplements. Absolutely. So on the body and in your body. There you go. That's it. There you go. We're going to put everything you need on your body and everything you need in your body. Krill oil. Yes. Really that's the, that's the one now it's Krill oil and then a super critical, one of the things that you know, you'll be happy to know that Pete and I, we like to make things happen and you know obviously I'm a big fan of Krill oil for instance. So you know what I was, I used to be a fan of white tea. [inaudible] a big fan and I drank it a lot and eventually I said you know what, I need this Jocko white tea.

Speaker 1:          02:25:51       And so I had a similar thing happened with Carrillo. I want to have krill oil. Good Carrillo so you know what we're making good krill oil. Yeah, actually we like to call it Jocko super. So Jocko super grill, we're, we're making that awesome quality. On top of that we got a little, again, littleG , we need joint maintenance, right? We need joint man is when we are active. When we're training Jiu Jitsu, when were Jack and big steel? We are tendons and everything and get a little bit sore. Sore. We might not admit to it in public, just like we wouldn't admit to crying on a public situation. Ever uncomfortable with my masculine has to be because I'm over here. Whoa. Now don't cry and cry. My wife says Pete, the only time you cry is babies and belts. When someone gets promoted and someone has a kid.

Speaker 1:          02:26:49       What about weddings? No, no, no funerals and weddings. No. So we got another, another thing we're coming out with. It's a Jocko joint warfare for your joints go to war against the pain. Inflammation in each generation. Yeah. And I've been kicking it for since we, since we originally formulated. Yep. And I got the samples. I went on it hardcore and it's Flagella legit the board about that. I have like bad back from sports and stuff. Herniated disc, bulging disc didn't get surgery. Severe Arthritis. I can train seven days a week if I want it to. As a matter of fact, we have our mission immersion campus week train every day, every day. That's it. Joint Warfare, it keeping it real. So that stuff we, it's being manufactured. We had been on the samples for one a month and a half. Um, and now it's been being manufactured in America check and very close by.

Speaker 1:          02:28:07       Right. By a partner. Right. And, and so it's gonna be on the website now, preorder it. And that way we can get to get a feel for how much, cause we've got a bunch coming. We need to figure out how much of a bunch is that actually means. So kind of like with Jocko white tea, I didn't do that. I just said, oh, the Jocko white tea for sale. It was gone. Then I ordered some more and then that was going on and people were really getting angry because when you, you know, when you have Jocko white tea and then you don't have it, all of a sudden, you know, things start going sideways. Yeah, absolutely. So you got to get that back straight up. So anyways, you can check those things out. Origin main.com there'll be there joint warfare. You like that, don't you?

Speaker 1:          02:28:48       I do. Yeah. There's a, there's a layer on there. Yeah. That's deep, deep layers. Oh yeah. The one person that's going to get this layer is dean lister. Yup. Yup, Yup. Trebuchet. I'll leave it at that. Well, you know Trump agenda, a lot of moving parts and a trebuchet. Yeah. I gotta keep him grease that. Got to keep that joints. Sure. Also speaking to jacking steel kettle bells. So when we came here, we're in Maine right now. If people haven't gathered that already up in camp. No. Like big weight room. Kinda. There's a little fitness center there. Yeah. First night we get here, one of the guys, they came, I brought my Onnit kettle bell or who wasn't gonna need to John. John. Yeah, it was John. Yeah. Nice honey. Kettle Bell. The gorilla. The ones I just ordered logit their ship. They're on the way tracking.

Speaker 1:          02:29:42       Anyway. Um, yeah, that's the good ones. You do kettle bells. I don't stop lifting though. That's where I stopped. I did. I stopped lifting two massive, well kettlebell massive, I don't even bring this up because we talked about this prerecording a so you a two 53 right now as we talked about, you use the way to 85 and I asked this question and this is a good question that everybody should kind of hear the answer to. Could the 250,250 pound Pete beat the 285 pound Pete in a grappling match and your answer was 100% the smaller guy wins. Why is that? I mean lots of reasons. You're more flexible, more flexible and better positioning. Better escapes cause there's less mass burning, less oxygen because you have less muscle mass. And for me, I would wear the 285 version of myself out. So it's I, I stopped and I love lifting weights.

Speaker 1:          02:30:45       I love lifting weights, but for me, Jujitsu fulfills the void because it is resistance. Yeah, you're always working. I never feel out of shape. Well unless I have too many whoopie pies, but she do anything to work out besides Jiu Jitsu. Do you run? Do you sprint? No Day. Just cause you choose who I do. Dean lister tells me that when Dean lister doesn't want to work out, doesn't want to do any, you know, sprints. He's like, no, I get, I get it from Jujitsu Jocko. That's what my best thing. So now you're supporting his argument. Now going to now, now got to deal with that.

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       We'll be Robert sued. You know we will talk about some day how Jujitsu makes you unathletic. Oh really? That's a whole nother talk. Interesting. And I have facts on why it makes you on athletic, what it keeps you. It keeps your body together, your core together, your muscles strong. So what does it do to make you unathletic? It's slow movement. You slow, you start when you started you to your body slows down, your mind slows down, your muscle slowed down. Whenever you had for fast twitch turns a slow twitch because you're pulling and tugging and you're moving slow. I used to be able to dunk a basketball every dunk so you can't touch the rim. Now I think we need to,

Speaker 6:          02:32:00       I will go ahead and defend the Jujitsu over here on my side of the table because if you continue to do cleans and you continue to squat, yeah. And you can do, you do sprints and mobility drills and uh, agility drills. You can keep that athleticism. I think you're right. I know you're right jack. That's what I did when I competed. I had a strength and conditioning coach, sprint lift, push, pull. So I guess big picture is one of those deals where it kind of confirms the idea that you don't have to be athletic to do good in Jujitsu, generally speaking. But if you want to do some kind of athletic competition, including, but not limited to Jiu Jitsu, it helps to be athletic. Jackson's deal. Yeah. I'm kind of glad that you kind of hit them with that because when I said I stopped doing like legs and stuff like that, I got a lot of crap for it by hand.

Speaker 3:          02:32:57       I, I, I did a lot of squats and college football, college football. Hell yeah. I, I'm scared of them. I like hack squats, hack squats. Man for sure. He got bad knees or something bad back. Bad back. You did my back. Yeah. But last time I squatted and I hit the floor. Right. Of course. Bad back, bad back from years of major s and personal question, does your ego not allow you to get in there and do 185 pounds for some higher reps? Nope. I do that 100% but you still don't like it? I do hack squats. I still don't write on, I still don't like it, but I mean it's steel is great. Yeah. That's the bottom line. It is great. Yeah. I just get it. Jujitsu, man. I pushed. I do. You know, every time I step on the mats at six 10 minute rounds and I've trained to the break, so I'm doing 12 minute rounds. I make sure to get six. Yeah. And I, and I get it as, as things free up and my son wants to lift as he started the summer, I'll get in with him and we'll, we'll press some iron. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:34:10       Yeah. That sounded pretty, pretty fired up. You want to go there, press a buyer in a big kettle bells don't get you that be, I mean, I'm sure under certain circumstances they will, but athletic. Yeah, like a hang clean. Clean them right here. I'm sorry. The jumpers. And the other big thing is when you like for a kettlebell snatch, it's a swinging motion and when it gets to the top you have to stop it, right? Because otherwise you're going to rip your shoulder out. So you have to use all this, whatever that kind of muscle, what is it, echo centric or something. What it concentric. Whenever you've got to do to stop it at the top, you got to stop it sorts. It's using all these muscles to make that thing happen. That's cool. Yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's cool. It'll get fun.

Speaker 6:          02:34:59       Like when you start getting like the balance and then the is the momentum, you got to create momentum. Then you've got a balance. A moment. It's like all this stuff is fun. College. They said that the true, a true test of how strong somebody is. I hang clean. Yeah. And they said you could bench a lot, you could squat on. Yeah, there's, there's a lot of people, there's a lot of things that you could say that like for instance, you know, what's a good one? Overhead squat spot. If you've got a guy that can do massive way big weight and or, or medium weight, high reps over and squat this word yet, but on a hang clean you got to use your speed also. It's speed, it's explosive. So you could just go straight to the snatch, right? Yeah. Right. But then again, the snatch, you need the balance at the top.

Speaker 6:          02:35:43       That's coordination and then all these other things. So, and it depends on what you mean by strong too. So you know how like I guess, you know, in, in certain circles they call strength power and strength and power are two different things. And it's like, okay, so what are you talking about? So I dig it and I agree actually. But this is also 20 years ago. Yeah, exactly right. You get another point to consider. That's a really good change. You think they agree? You said hang clean, right? Hang clean. That's a real metric. Yeah. The solid metric. Yeah, for sure. Dead lift. Another solid metric, by the way. Yeah. Raw strength. That's what, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cause consider a member by like when you're a kid or maybe old school kind of philosophy. It's like, hey, you know, you get the old timer and he was like, whoa. Stronger you and you're like real strong. We're sir. Okay. Pick that up. You know what I mean? Okay. You can't pick it up. You're weak. You can't, you're strong. And he comes and picks it up and then the step two is pick it up over your head. You've got to dead lift the deadlift. Yeah. Oh yeah. No, just kidding. Yeah. Let's not do this.

Speaker 6:          02:36:49       Yay. That's good. But don't get too nuts with that though. Who is that? I was just talking to somebody. There were lots of dead lifts. It was Ed. Yeah. He was like, Hey, you know my back and stuff. I was like, I don't get crazy with dead lifts. No. But you can talk to plenty of people that say, Oh, I had a bad back and I dead lifted and now it's healed. Right, right. Plenty of [inaudible] would say that absolutely crazy with them because they give you good gesture straight, like your your backs and bad a lot of times anyway, even just anywhere in your core is because when you have like some core or your back or something, when you do stuff, you adjust to that. Use it. And it's a dead lift. Yeah, because you don't use it anymore. So now when you do something, you're grabbing the cranberry juice from this side. You're going to put it over here. You gotta like floor and you're like, how did I do that? Cranberry juice.

Speaker 6:          02:37:38       Sugar in a bottle broke. But you shouldn't be. That's your body's way of telling. You don't want that. Cool. Hey Man, I dig it. Maybe you're grabbing it from here, put it in the trashcan or something like this. You know? I'm just saying. That's why though. So you go dead lift, not heavy, not crazy. Just like your buddies like, like you need lifting. It's like your buddy just getting used to it. So boom. You used to picking stuff up and I want to try it. Do it. I like it. Try the kettle bells too. And if you want the cool ones and when I say cool, it's like you look at them and they're cool, like irrefutably cool on it. That's the ones the gorilla want to actually don't do the gorilla on this first. Do the chimp one first straight to zombies. We were just super strong, doesn't have the same categories and I forget what they're all called Zombie.

Speaker 6:          02:38:23       When I look at the legend versus the gorilla ones or the primate ones too. To the zombies. I wanted the ones that look crazy and evil. Yeah, that's no biggie. I think we both, we all collectively know why you want the zombies. Technically it's so, but that brings up a good point in my opinion. All the different categories, primal bills, that's the champ, the, you know, all the things, different zombies, all zombies, legends, Werewolf, cyclops, cyclops, like all the legends. So boom, pick your category. But that's the cool ones. I recommend. What else? Check them out. Hey man, jump ropes off kind of. Actually, it's Kinda good. You go in there and they have all kinds of workout stuff like stuff, you know, haul brag. You know how when you get into a workout, maybe not you, you're not like this, but like I got into the kettle bells and it became fun.

Speaker 6:          02:39:15       You know, you know how like, um, if something becomes fun for me, I stopped doing it and do something that sucks, but well, Dang this psychologically challenging, but they got all kind and they have like the Macy's and you know, all the workout stuff or whatever. Anyway, that's a go down on it.com/jocko check out that stuff and man get after it. Even if you're getting bored, man, you've got some interesting stuff to work out with. Highly recommend. Awesome. Also, if you like these books, Pete didn't write a book. Wait to have you written a book before and I wouldn't be surprised. I wrote along ass paper when I couldn't sleep over the last year, but total book. So yeah, little bit different. But anyway. A lot of times Jocko, we'll review books on this podcast. People like to get them. If you're one of those people out there, go the website, chocolate podcast.com section books from the podcast.

Speaker 6:          02:40:08       Click through there to get the books. That's a good way to support it. Takes you to Amazon or if you're doing any of the other shopping, do it through their big support. Small actions. My action. Big Reaction. Nice. Also, subscribe to the podcast. Google play. We still feel the need to say that. Yeah, because what? Some people aren't subscribed in the event, you know it's it. I guess it's just our guests, my guests. There's probably hype type pot. This is speaking as my hypothesis is what I'm saying. There's probably a marginal group who's like, Hey, who's Jocko? I heard him on Joe Rogan, or I don't know. I seen him on whatever, and then I call him and listen to the podcast. I was like, okay, cool. Well listen to let me listen to another one. Okay, cool. Maybe I'm not down. You know, he's kind of weird or just whatever they don't understand.

Speaker 6:          02:41:05       Like, oh, I can subscribe to this, but I can just get it'll, it'll tell me when it's coming. Right. Cause a lot of people don't listen to podcasts. Yeah. I know. I got a question for you about that. Have you thought about, cause you, this is number 90. Have you thought about breaking the podcasts into categories to speak to your audience because you cover such a broad audience? Um, when you say breaking them, you just another section like cutty had him up. No, no, no. The full podcast where you're covering books, where you're talking about business, where you're interviewing somebody, breaking them up that way. Yeah. They are a cent tech. There's not a linear, right. You don't have to listen from you. Right. I recommend when someone says, Hey, you know, I just heard your podcast. I heard, I heard, I just isn't that podcast you just put out, I want to listen to the rest of them.

Speaker 6:          02:41:58       Should I go backwards? Should I go forward? And I tell people start at one and, and, and most of the people that I talked to that are into the podcast, they're like, that's the right advice. Tell people, start at one. If I said Jocko, I want to listen to your real business related podcasts, I couldn't, could I do that or know what we are going to do? And I have this in the background going into something that I've been trying to get done for a while is we're gonna kind of archive where you're going to be able to maybe figure out, oh I want to listen to business. Boom and here's a podcast, a section. Now whether or not we'd like chop them up and put them into one group, um, not yet. Not yet. Not yet. Yeah. I mean it, you're, yeah, it's not organized we'll say, but you know, it's one of those things you've got to manually look, you know, cause it'll say what it's about.

Speaker 6:          02:42:47       In fact, the Puck, it's straight up by timestamp talking about, you know, that you can kind of do it that way. But no, not organized. Like if, if you're, and it makes sense though, because if we're talking about a book and people like what Love World War II love pull most 10 podcasts in world war two and they can just get after it and then maybe, you know, just an idea. Good Idea Pete House. Big Time. But yeah, subscribe. That's a good one. If you haven't already. How about that? If you haven't already subscribed, that's a good one. Also, youtube, subscribe to Allen Nouns a little bit more. Like make sense to be like, hey, subscribe to, and the big thing that you might not know is if you're not subscribed to youtube, there could be things that are not in the podcast. Yeah. So let's say you liked the podcasts, you're listening to it and you go, yeah, well I've heard all the podcasts.

Speaker 6:          02:43:36       I don't need to get youtube. You're wrong. Yeah. Because there could be things released into the youtube. I have not been released, for instance, deleted scenes, deleted scene, which is us talking some off the record about things like people that have certain, you know, what issues, uh, nothing, bro. Lack of squatting issues. Brassy. Yeah. And I said I had stopped squatting because of blockchain. The technically the story goes, I stop squatting because my wife said, hey, your legs are like real big and it looks weird. That's funny cause my wife said you're starting to get an old man but cold the same thing me, I don't know dude. Dang. Just like it though. I'm squatting. You need to get all the songs but like kettle bell swings. Bull. Yeah. That's what they say. They say that the, the regular or the Russian kettlebell swings posterior chain a new day.

Speaker 6:          02:44:41       I learned that either way. Yeah, the deleted scenes. That's what he was giving me shit about, cause I stopped squatting. Actually I didn't stop squatting. I stop squatting like hardcore legs. You know what I'm saying? He stops crying. He said the point is, is you stopped squatting deleted scenes or on their uh, excerpts to, you know, like let's say you were like, Hey, I liked that part and people still email me about that by the way. What are like, Hey, what was that part? Or what episode was that? From that part where it, whatever. So instead of having to scour, share that excerpts, easy to find. So yeah, that's a good and subscribe to youtube also. Jocko is a store, it's called Jocko store Jocko store.com. Guess what's on there? Everything.

Speaker 6:          02:45:31       Potentially everything. But as of right now, there's some shirts on their women's stuff, on their patches on there. You know, you put them on your hat, interchangeable, velcro patches if you will. Rash guards. Awesome. So now they have two options, Huh? Jocko rash guards get after it to trooper darkness. Rash guards and origin rash guards. Yeah. Just like that. The selection just vast. Yeah. And eventually they're going to be right. And this will be, we'll, it'll all be kind of melt together as one big vast place to just go. And these going to be a melting pot of Awesomeness, right? Yes, indeed. Indeed. Yeah. All that. So, and some hoodies on there. Yeah. I think we should consult. No. [inaudible] I'm going to tell you, I already know what he's gonna say. He's from Hawaii. What, you want a lightweight Hoodie? No, he, he, so he made hoodies and I'm from New England.

Speaker 6:          02:46:32       That's all. It's like, oh, you make a Hoodie, you can wear it in like a full fledge Arctic storm and you're going to have a heavyweight cotton hoodie. So his, his hoodies are, are, are light. They're, they're cool for so cal. Yeah, they're good for Hawaii. If you even have hoodies in Hawaii, they're like a fall Hoodie I guess. And even that's like, my guess. I don't know. That's why I'm saying we should consult. I mean his, his like his consultation things when I consult him like, Hey, it's, it's like mixed in with a scolding. So, you know, I get the scolding first, then the info like maybe I want to make a really, really bad ass flat locked Hoodie or to do it. What is a flat, what does that, wait a sec. That seemed Hoodie. Well, how could we possibly do that? [inaudible] where are we going to get someone that knows how to make flat locked?

Speaker 6:          02:47:16       Awesome. Badass hoodies. Hm. Oh wait, we're sitting. Get him a factory where we can make it happen. The big one. There you go. That's good stuff also. Hmm. Psychological warfare. Previously, a few minutes ago we talked about joint warfare for joint degeneration. In summation, all that stuff. Overall, real generous. Generally supplementation for your body. Yeah. Sometimes you need supplementation for your mind. Your mind. Yes. Full on. So in your campaign against weakness, psychological weakness, you know you're trying to get up every day, right? Stick to the Diet. Can that help me with eating multiple whoopie pies? Yes. Yes, yes. Actually, there isn't a specific tab for this. I'm definitely interested in that because that's been my one struggle as a human. What is a whoopie pie? I will be pies. Like cake and whipped cream. Right? Like a fig Newton commercial cause kick some ass. Fig Newton is like if you put those two next to each other, they're in different planets.

Speaker 6:          02:48:23       Exactly. The plants. Newton's were healthy though. Allegedly. They're actually just a big giant blocks of sugar, sugar cane, which is pretty much what it will be. Bias, which is why my homie over here, you've got a kid. I'm a single parent family, four kids. We were fighting over the food in the house too. I've never broken out of that. And the Whoopie Pie, we need a break. We can, we can worse, we can introduce you to attract called sugarcoated lives. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I get very interested in that. We'll, we'll get you on the [inaudible] week there. Yeah. And you'd think it'd be like Jocko yelling at you, like don't, whatever. But it's a pragmatic explanation of what your mind is doing right now and what it shouldn't be doing and what it should be doing and psychological warfare that can help you with that. Basically.

Speaker 6:          02:49:11       You mentioned that it's an album, it's an oh yeah, yeah. It's an album with tracks on iTunes, Jocko tracks, iTunes, Amazon music, like all these things. Yeah. MP three and you know what you, you're probably sitting here thinking like, okay, that's a neat little idea that, you know, echo came up with and made Jack would do this and Oh, cool. That album number one spoken word album on iTunes for, I don't know, I lost 38 straight weeks to kidding me. Number one. That's bad ass. No big deal. You know, Shit. Yeah, it's awesome. And I will say that when echo is like, dude, you just got, you know, just, just, you know, these things that I'm asking you about, what you kind of just like, you know, hammering and I'll just record it. But it's basically like, okay, so I used to have this thing, you stew, not anymore.

Speaker 6:          02:50:02       Had this thing where you don't, when you're like, okay, I'm, I'm working out this day, this day, you know, I'm just through this day and when it comes time to workout and I have a gym at my house now, so I'm like, ah, maybe I'll, I'll do it. I meant to do it at noon. I'm going to do it tonight. I want, I don't feel like doing it wrong and do it tonight. And then, you know, accountability. Nobody's watching. You can do what you want when I feel like it a little bit marching, some coffee mate, whatever. It's right outside, you know, can I totally get it? And that, that, that night turns into hail, do it tomorrow. So you basically turn a workout day into a rest days. You turn on your motivation to get it done. Yeah, and it's, again, it's not like a motivational thing. It's like, okay, this is, it's Jocko saying it so, okay, there's that, but it's like, it's saying, okay, this is what's going on right now.

Speaker 6:          02:50:46       This is what you're thinking right now. This is what you shouldn't be thinking right now. This is what you should be thinking right now. Okay. There you go. Cool. Gotcha. It's when you're like, oh, the thing that I find about them is because it is me talking. I find it there. They're very, very tight arguments. Yeah. You'll get done listening and you go, you know what, man? I still find a little hole in his argument. You know? I think there's one sugarcoat who's one will be buys it and not going to be happy. I know you're like, you know what? This is a big deal and I'm sitting there will be biocide. Know you might be the ultimate test case. Yeah. I will be the ultimate. I don't care. I don't care who's around me, Ben. If I get this craving for sugar, we were traveling the other day.

Speaker 6:          02:51:27       What? I get sweet tea. Oh Dang. Why sugar, sugar, sugar. But keep in mind I'm going to ruin, you know your mom is, I know I can't, you know, you're like, hey, you want to try these things and I, I know what it is. And, and you said, man, you got to try this sparkle ball. My Mom's coming back though, bro. I know it's sweet, right? And you go, Oh yeah, yeah it is. And I go, you never had spartan balaclava yeah, I was like, you know, could, you know, no big deal. And, and you know, we've been lately been saying like, you know, a discipline won't allow it. That's between pizza. When we, when we maybe see each other maybe a path that we shouldn't

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       be taking, we're going off the path and onto the path of weakness. You know, how might be like, Hey Echo, you know, that's cool and everything, but the discipline won't allow that. Oh man, that's awesome. You know yesterday, you know you're dangling this custom homemade lavar and my mom's there and your mom's there actually like, and I know I can see her. She looks like she arrived from Greece three days ago to make the buck of off. I'm like, okay, I'll have one. Right. So I had one yesterday and then the discipline wouldn't allow anymore today I had nine of them.

Speaker 1:          02:52:44       I think I have three of them today. I have three of them sugarcoated lies. Balaclavas get some. My Mom's is going to get called to make baklava origin. Ballclub are pretty serious maple syrup. But yeah. But keep in mind though, with these tracks, you got to be on that path though. It's not like you're like, hey, I eat too much. Let me listen to this track. It's not that. It's the, okay, my plan is to straight up clean up my whole shit like by my plan is. So you've already found a bit of motivation. Yes. Yeah. You're motivated. You're on the path or already, but it's on the weakness moments, the moments of weakness. You're like, okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna arrest today. I'm going to, you know, whatever. Is that kind of, I do. We all do. We all do. That's, that's probably why a lot of people get that album with tracks.

Speaker 1:          02:53:33       You ration what I used to do. No, no. What I would do is this. I'd be like, especially when I was training for competition, I'm going to eat this whoopie pie. I would eat it and that would run two miles. Yeah. I was being earned it frigging right. Yeah. I do that too, like it. Normally I try and pre empt weakness with hardcore exercise, which by the way often mitigates. It takes like a like, oh, I want to have a mint chocolate chip milkshake. Cool. I can have a mint chocolate chip milkshake. As soon as I do 30 clean and jerks at the bar down, I can do that and that's cool, but then by the time you get done, you're like, you know what? I'm going to want that thing. I infuse my brain with discipline from the bar. They went from the bar into my hands and into my brain and so that's a great idea.

Speaker 1:          02:54:23       Yeah. Even in the simplest one is burry burpees like, okay, you know what, I can have this if I do a hundred burpees that takes less than 10 minutes. We had this thing the other day and I talked about it. My freezer in my house broke and so we had, I have an RV and our frozen food was in the RV refrigerator and I wanted some ice cream and then I was like, ah, you know it's all the way up. Get it. And I said to myself, God, wow, lazy loser. You don't even deserve ice cream. I didn't have it cause I said, you're a pathetic, if you're actually questioning whether it's worth it, Geico to be our call, you don't need this at all in any way, shape or form. If you were thinking it wasn't worth 27 steps to get to the RV, grabbed the mint chocolate chip Bryers ice cream, bring it back down, scoop it into a bowl, let it melt a little bit and then just sit there and get after it.

Speaker 1:          02:55:17       So good. You're like a little melt to the ice cream. Just a little mail. I don't like it if I ever had to turn gains bowl. No. Have you ever heard that term gains ball? Uh, it's, it's you, you basically take ice cream and you put milk in it. Oh, stirred around Gainesville. That's what I do. But let's, let's all detach right now and consider what we're talking about right now. The pleasures of gains bowl. The problem is chocolate chip ice cream. I would walk barefoot and two feet of snow to that frigging RV. Look at this guy. No, he was that compliment that or is that a negative or positive? No, yours is worse. It's weird because you have a better result, but your discord or your path is where, cause he was like, Hey, I'm going to be weak. I have discipline that week to week.

Speaker 1:          02:56:08       That was him that day. But you could, that's rationalize because at the end, you know the means and the end situation thing is I actually embarrassed myself. Yeah. Yeah. That's what it was. I just hated myself. And I said, I can't believe I'm even questioning the fact if I would take 27 steps to my arm, get the ice cream, the fact that I'm even thinking that way, I should, I should Hayes myself. This is ridiculous and pathetic and just stop. And so yeah, I didn't get the ice cream that night, but the mint chocolate chip ice cream for sure is, is a real thing. And it's even, it's my favorite flavor is my flavors. Although when I was in Montana, who's tracks those tracks? Moose tracks, that's the other, that's the other. I'm not going to, you know, I am going to stand and I thought, and I dig it, but it's just, it's very surprising that the way you can close the Moose track with a scoop of mint chocolate chip.

Speaker 1:          02:57:08       I've never done that. That sounds deranged. It's like it would push me over. He says, Jesus, a cheese and wine grapes. Oh Jeez. Just clothes. It's just a finishing touch is what we should do. Is that what we should do now? One of my buddies in the trees or is it is a awesome guy. Bad ass wrestler. Wrestled was a champion wrestler in college and it was on the Olympic team. Uh, didn't compete for variety of reasons that I won't talk about. Uh, but he was friends with Dan Severn. You remember Danny saw? Yeah. Early UFC and so, and so. I don't know why this just came to my mind. Oh, I know why I did. So he would say they knew each other, they were friends and whenever he'd see Danny Severn, Danny [inaudible] was a heavyweight and this buddy of mine was cutting weight, you know, and when he was a big guy, he was like whatever, like 200 pounds be to cut to one you whenever.

Speaker 1:          02:58:02       And he would call Dan Severn pot liquor. Meaning like meaning like you're, you're just, you're a guy that's over there. You're eating everything and when you get done eating, you're licking the pot. Right. I picture you with a smile. You got straight up palm liquor cause you get to the end of that bowl, you're like, oh I'm getting the, the rest of this mint chocolate chip ice cream is getting into my belly now. My kids have followed the path of my wife and they'll come up to me when I'm eating junk food and they'd be like, Dad, you got moves that and they'll just grab of that fat on my guts. You don't need that. Oh they're brutal. Dang. Kind of the psychological warfare situation. Yeah it is. I'm surprised you're not sometimes 84 pounds. I should be scarred mentally actually. Whoa. What do we say?

Speaker 1:          02:58:55       That's the freedom part. But the thing is he got to be on the path. So like, yeah. You know how say discipline equals freedom, right? So you know you grab the ice cream. Yeah, I had to pull that one for the first time I was at, I was a little like family get together and there was, it was a birthday party for a friend of the family, blah, blah blah. And there was a grandmother there. So a grandmother of one of these kids. I had a birthday party, blah blah blah. So, and she's a German woman and you know, she kind of knows what's going on a little bit with the game. What with what's going on with everything. And so I'm sitting there and there's like a um, you know, straight up, this is rough. You know the ice cream cakes as you can get a mic check.

Speaker 1:          02:59:36       Do I know we have ice cream cake is a mint chocolate chip ice cream cake talking to a fat kid. So I'm like, if we're talking to a pot liquor, so, so I'm like, okay, you know what, we're going to get some of that mint chocolate chip ice cream. It's got those, what? I don't even know what it is. Those little black Crum things that Oreo or something like something like that on there too. We're talking, this is a situation that needs to be, you know, we, we need to get in on this thing real quick and he's a little bit melted so it's soft. So anyways, I'm cutting a piece of the cake and not a big piece, not a small piece, but you know, like a medium piece. Getting it on my plate, stick my fork in it. And this woman is German woman who's super cool.

Speaker 1:          03:00:13       She's like, I thought you were about the discipline. And I was like, Dang. And she called me out and uh, I looked at her, I said, you know what? I have the discipline and that allows me to have freedom sometimes to eat mint chocolate chip ice cream cakes, which I'm about to do. Thank you. That's it. Just say this is the freedom park. But like I said, you gotta be on the path. You gotta be in the game. You can't just be like, this is the freedom part every single day. No, it doesn't work. That doesn't work that way. Um, also Jocko white tea, you can get that. You know what it does if you're gonna start dead lifting again, you, you should get drink a little bit more Jocko white tea because it will increase your dead lift to 8,000 pounds. And this is proven, proven across the board. I'm on it. Uh, everyone, uh, books, I got some books. If you want to get them extreme ownership book about leadership book about combat leadership,

It's gonna make your life easier when everyone is on board. If you got kids or you know, kids, you can pick them up. A book called the way of the warrior kid and what that's gonna do is going to lay out a path, actually a yeah, that a kid who doesn't have a path, most kids don't have a path. The book will give them the path and the path leads them to being stronger, smarter and better. So my daughter read it, she loved it. That is awesome. And she is an individual and she speaks her mind. And I was like, Chloe, no, really? What each thing, she goes, I love that book.

I'll be back tomorrow. Awesome. Uh, that's, yeah, I appreciate it. And Yeah, straight up, like when you ask kids, how did you like it, which I always ask kids how they like it and cause you know, kids, like you said, kids are going to tell you the truth. And so, so far I have not had a kid go, eh, marginal March and hold, you know, marginal.
