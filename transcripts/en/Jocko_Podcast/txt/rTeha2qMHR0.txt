Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 35 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening.

Speaker 1:          00:00:14       Weeper was ahead when he and born reached the gap in the wire star shale after star shell was going up now and the whole line did woken up. Machine guns were talking, but there was one that would not talk. The rattle of musketry continued, but the mist was kindly to them. It had thickened again as they got beyond the trampling clutching wire born saw weeper a couple of paces ahead of him and what he thought was the last of their party disappearing into the missed about 20 yards away. He was glad to be clear of the wire. Another star's Gel went up and they both froze stillness under it's glare. Then they moved again. Hurrying for all they were worth born. Felt a sense of triumph and escape thrill in him. Anyway, the Hun couldn't see him. Now

Speaker 1:          00:01:13       something kicked him in the upper part of the chest. Rending its way through him and his agonized cry was scarcely on a bull in the rush of blood from his mouth as he collapsed and fell. We per turned his head over his shoulder, listened, stopped and went back. He found born trying to lift himself and born spoke, gasping, suffocating. Go on. I'm scuppered, I'll not leave the said Wipper said weeper he stood and lifted the other in is huge on Ganglia arms. Carrying him as tenderly as though we were a child born. Struggled weirdly to speak in the blood, feeling his mouth prevented him. Sometimes his head fell on weeper shoulder that last barely articulate. A few words came. I'm finished. Leamy and peace for God's sake. You can't, I'll not leave the said weeper in infuriate rage, he felt born stretch himself in a convulsive shutter and relax, becoming suddenly heavier in his arms. He struggled on stumbling over the shell plowed ground through that fantastic mist, which moved like an army of wraiths hurrying away from him. Then he stopped and taking the body by the waist with his left arm, flung it over his shoulder, steadying it with his right. He could see their wire now and presently he was challenged and replied. He found the way through the wire and staggered into the trench with his burden. And he turned down the short stretch.

Speaker 2:          00:03:08       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:03:09       to monk trench trench and came on the rest of the party outside. A company's dug out. I brought him back. He cried desperately and collapsed with the body on the duck boards

Speaker 1:          00:03:31       in that is from a book called the middle parts of fortune, which is written by a gay guy named Frederick Manning who served with the Kings Shropshire light infantry in world war one. He served with the seventh battalion at the battle of the Somme and after the war he became a writer in the book, which is actually a novel, but based on his experiences was published as being written by private one nine zero two two total got originally published and then after his death he finally received credit for writing it and it's a, it's a very powerful book and I wanted to start with that excerpt from World War One because it is the most shining in my mind in most horrific example of attrition warfare, almost 20 million killed usually over a few hundred yards of trench and I can't, I can't stand that. Attrition warfare is a strategy in which one side tries to grind down and wear down the other side and they break when they no longer have the men, the soldiers, the people, the humans or the supplies to keep it going and it's brutal and it also gives no real advantage to intellect thought and to tactical prowess on the battlefield

Speaker 1:          00:05:26       and I don't like it. Now the opposite of attrition warfare is maneuver warfare. And that's what we're going to dive into tonight. The book is the Maneuver Warfare Handbook, but as we talk about it, think about it not just being about war and about combat, but about how attrition, warfare and maneuver warfare can be easily seen in the way that we lead in. No, and also in the way we interact with other people with other humans, which is what leading is.

Speaker 2:          00:06:06       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:06:08       And so here we go into this book right here, maneuver warfare handbook. It's written by William s Linde and we'll get into him in a minute.

Speaker 1:          00:06:22       Here we go. With the book. I served over 31 years active duty with the marine corps, saw combat in both Korea and Vietnam and attended service schools from the basic school to the National War College. Yet only toward the end of my military career did I realize how little I really understood the art of war. Even as a PFC in Korea after being medivaced along with most of my platoon after a fruitless frontal assault against superior North Korean forces, it seemed to me there had to be a better way to wage war. 17 years later commanding a bat, a battalion at k song, I was resolved that none of my re marines would die for lack of superior combat power, but we were still relying on the concentration of superior fire power to win, essentially still practicing grants, attrition warfare and we were still doing frontal assaults.

Speaker 1:          00:07:20       That opening right there is a colonel John c stuck, uh, Marine Corps obviously, and he just kinda explained his, his, his career path serving in both Korea and Vietnam and he goes on the author of this book, so he's doing the foreword to this book, Maneuver Warfare. The author of this book has never served a day of active military duty and he has never been shot at, although there are no doubt some senior officers would like to remedy that later ladder deficiency. So he's a little bit unpopular. The guy that wrote this book with some with some people, yet he demonstrates an amazing understanding of the art of war as have only a small handful of military thinkers I have come across in my career. So he's talking about this Guy William William s Lind.

Speaker 2:          00:08:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:17       And here he goes into some details on William s Lind and how he, how he came into contact with them. Back to the book. When I first heard bill Lind speak, I must confess, I resented a mirror civilian expressing criticism of the way our beloved core did things. After all, he was not one of us. He had not shed blood with us in battle. He was not a brother and I had strong suspicions that he would have difficulty passing the Pft, meaning the physical test of physical this. So this guy with a Linde, not, not exactly a high level athlete, but what he said made sense for the first time I was personally hearing someone advocate a new unapproached, a war that was based on intellectual innovation rather than sheer material superiority, mission type orders, surfaces and gaps. She feared punked instead of the rigid formulas and checklists that we normally associate with our training and doctrine. It was a stimulating experience through Lynn's articulation. Years of my own reading of military history began to make a lot more sense.

Speaker 2:          00:09:30       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:09:30       but why all this from a civilian instead of a professional soldier? In fact, the entire movement for, for military reform is driven largely by civilian intellectuals, not military officers. One notable exception being retired air force, Colonel John Boyd. When you think about it, this is not surprising. We have never institutionalized a system that encourages innovative ideas or curry or criticism from subordinates. So there you go. It's the military w what do you say to your, what do you say to your superior officer? I don't think that's a good plan. No. What they're told to do is support the plant proposing significant change. His view, frequently viewed as criticism of superiors. Since they are responsible for the way things are and borders on disloyalty, if not insubordination. So it is not surprising that the Movement for reform comes from outside the military establishment.

Speaker 1:          00:10:27       And he goes on to say Bh Lid, that Ladelle heart, which Bh Liddell Hart was a guy that fought in world war one, a Brit that fought in world war one battle the psalm, he got hit three times, uh, eventually was gassed set out on the line and almost his entire battalion was wiped out. And this guy eventually wrote a book called strategy, an indirect approach. And an interesting, I pulled up one quote from him, um, often the longest way around is the shortest way there. This is the indirect approach. So anyways, back to the book here on what Bh Ladelle heart said bl, uh, heart once remark that the only thing harder than getting a new idea into the military mind is to get an old one out in 1925 when he was expounding such hysterical theories as the indirect approach, the American General Service Schools Review of current military literature dismissed one of Lidl hearts major works as negative value to the instructors at these schools. I expect Marine Corps schools to receive this publication with similar enthusiasm, but I cannot believe a professional military officer would not benefit reading it.

Speaker 2:          00:11:55       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:11:56       so that's if you took to, to catch the setup of this book. He's saying, look, this is different than what we've been taught. This is the different in in, by the way, this, this book, I'm checking the dates right now. This came out in 1985 so there has been progress in this direction since then. But at the time that this came out, it was just, it was viewed as almost insubordination to think this way. So let's jump into it right here with the theory of maneuver warfare. So now we're getting to Linde himself. Writing maneuver warfare is not new. It probably dates from the first time a caveman surprise, an enemy from behind instead of meeting him club to club. Sometimes the word maneuver is used as a synonym for movement. Such such as in references to fire and maneuver in small unit tactics. So that's, you know, we have in the book extreme ownership cover move and, and that's what we're talking about. We're talking about move, he's saying fire maneuver is the same use of the word maneuver to mean move.

Speaker 2:          00:13:13       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:13:14       Maneuver is organized movement of troops during combat operations to a new access and region for the purpose of taking an advantageous position relative to the enemy in order to deliver a decisive strike so that that's sort of the classical definition, but when used in the phrase maneuver warfare maneuver means much more. Only recently has someone suggested a convincing answer of of what maneuver means. That man is a retired air force colonel and fighter pilot named John Boyd. Colonel Boyd's development of the theory of maneuver warfare began not with ground battles, but with a study of some mock air to air combat exercises conducted at Nellis Air Force Base in 1974 that led him back to the study of air to air combat. During the Korean War. American aviators were very successful in that conflict. They achieved a 10 to one kill ratio over there. North Korean and Chinese opponents. Colonel Boyd began his study with a question, how and why did we do so well?

Speaker 1:          00:14:23       He noted in several tradition, he noted that in several traditional measures of aircraft performance, the principal communist fighter, the make 15 was superior to the American f 86 so you might think, oh, Americans always have the best technology, not true. So and, and Boyd will end up doing void. We're going to hear quite a bit about them right now, but this guy was sort of a strategic genius in the air force and a bunch of people on Twitter hit me and social media. I've always been saying, you gotta do Boyd, got to do Boyd and I, and I know I've got to do Boyd at some point. And this is sort of a good introduction to Boyd. So here's the, here's the difference between the make 15 and the American f 86 the mic 15 it could climb and accelerate faster and it had better sustained turn rate.

Speaker 1:          00:15:10       But in two less obvious measures of aircraft performance, the [inaudible] 86 was much superior to the mic. First. The pilot could see out much bet better. The fat six bubble canopy gave its pilot very good outward vision. While the Migs faired fared, canopy made it difficult to see out. Second, the SF 86 had a high powered and highly effective hydraulic controls and the meg did not. This meant that while the Mig could do many individual actions including turn, climb and accelerate better than the fat six, the fat six could transition from one action to another much more quickly than the Mig. It was better in the transition, so for all you Jujitsu players and you start that scramble, you start that scrambled, the the f 86 is a better scrambler. Using these two superiorities, the American pilots developed a tactical approach that forced the Mig into a series of actions each.

Speaker 1:          00:16:15       Each time the action changed. The fad six gained a time advantage because the f 86 pilot could see more quickly how the situation had changed and he could also make his aircraft shift more quickly to a new action so he can see what's happening faster. Then once he sees it, which he saw faster, now he can make his adjustment faster. With each change, the migs actions became more inappropriate until they were so inappropriate that the Mig gave the fat six a good firing opportunity. Often it appeared the Mig pilot realized what was happening to him and panicked which made the American pilot's job all the easier.

Speaker 3:          00:16:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:56       Later, Colonel Boyd began studying ground combat to see if there were any situations similar to that he had found in the air war over Korea. He found that in battles campaigns in wars like Vicksburg and France, a similar things seem to have happened one side at presented the other with a sudden unexpected change or a series of such changes to which it could not adjust in a timely manner. As a result, it was defeated and it was generally defeated at small costs as the victor. Often the losing side had been physically stronger than the winner, just like the Mig 15 was, was physically faster, it, it didn't matter

Speaker 1:          00:17:41       and often the same sort of panic and paralysis the North Korean and Chinese pilots had shown seem to occur. Colonel Boyd asked himself, what did all these cases have in common? His answer was what is now called the Boyd theory, which is the theory of maneuver warfare. The briefing Colonel Boyd gives to explain his theory patterns of conflict takes over five hours. So he, so the, so Colonel Boyd does give this brief and it takes over five hours or he did when he was, when he was alive, but at the cost of missing some of the subtleties and supporting historical evidence in the briefing, it can be summarized as follows. So here's a kind of a synopsis of the Boyd Theory that, uh, Lind is going to put together for us right now.

Speaker 2:          00:18:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:29       Back to the book. Conflict can be seen as time competitive observation, orientation, decision action cycles. Each party to a conflict begins by observing. He observes himself, has physical surroundings and his enemy on the basis of his opposite observation, he orients. That is to say he makes a mental image or snapshot of his situation on the basis of this orientation. He makes a decision, he puts the decision into effect. I, he, he acts then because he assumes his action has changed the situation. He observes again and starts the process of new. His actions follow a cycle, sometimes called the Boyd cycle or Ooda loop and Buddhas o d a and that's observe, Orient, decide and act.

Speaker 1:          00:19:22       If one side in a conflict can consistently go through the Boyd cycle faster than the other, it gains a tremendous advantage, advantage. By the time the slower side acts, the faster side is doing something different from what he observed and his action is inappropriate. With each cycle. The slower parties action is inappropriately, is inappropriate by a larger time margin, even though he desperately strives to do something that will work, each action is less useful than its predecessor. He falls further and further behind. Ultimately, he ceases to be effective and neat. We clearly, I mean, this is obvious and combat is also obvious and in Jiu Jitsu, I mean very clear. When you're training, when you're rolling with somebody, if they're not making adjustments fast enough, you just, it's two or three, two or three transitions and you got them, you're on their back. You,

Speaker 2:          00:20:18       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:19       The Boyd theory defines what is meant by the word maneuver. In the term maneuver warfare maneuver means Boyd cycling, Boyd cycling the enemy being consistently faster through however many Ooda loops it takes until the enemy loses his cohesion, until he can no longer fight and as an effective organized force, sometimes a Boyd cycled enemy panics or becomes passive. This is an ideal outcome for the victor because a panicked passive enemy can be annihilated, captured at the lowest cost in friendly casualties. At other times, the outmaneuvered enemy may continue to fight as individuals or small units, but because he can no longer act effectively as a force, he is comparatively easy to destroy.

Speaker 4:          00:21:05       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:21:06       so continuing on, if the object in maneuver warfare is to move through the Ooda loops faster than the enemy, what do you need to do? How can you be consistently faster? Much of the much of the rest of this book is an effort to address that question, but in terms of general theory, the following points are worth thinking about. One only a decentralized military can have a faster Ooda loop. If the observations must be passed up, the chain of command, the orientation made, and the decision taken at a high level and the command for action then transmitted back down the chain, the Ooda loop is going to be slow. As the Israeli military historian Martin Van Creveld has observed from Plato to NATO, the history of command in war consists of an endless quest for certainty.

Speaker 4:          00:22:04       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:04       Certainty concerning the state and intention of the enemy's forces. Certainty concerning the manifold factors which together constitute the environment from the weather and the terrain to the radioactivity and presence of chemical warfare agents. And last but definitely not least certainty concerning the state and activities of one's own forces. Historical commanders have always faced with a choice between two basic ways of coping with uncertainty. One was to construct an army of automatons following the orders of a single man allowed to do only that which could be controlled. That's centralized command. The other two design organizations and operations in such a way as to enable the former to carry out the latter without the need for continuous control this second, the second of these methods has that's decentralized command. The second of these methods has by and large proved more successful than the first and the ongoing revolution in the technology of command, not withstanding, this is likely to remain so in the future and indeed so long as war itself exists.

Speaker 1:          00:23:20       Very obvious stuff in and again, you know in in, in our book extreme ownership. That's one of the principles of, of combat decentralized command and this is what it is. If you don't have decentralized command that you have to report up the chain of command, that takes time. By the time it gets back down what the decision, the decision gets made at the higher level, then they pass it back down to you. By the time it gets to you, it's already changed. And that's in a Jujitsu and Jujitsu comparison, if you will, if you have to think about your moves so you have instinct moves, muscle memory. When somebody starts to pass your guard, you get the under rock. If you have to think about getting the underhook and you have to command your body to get the underwear because they already got the under hook on you. Yeah, so it's the same thing here. This is that's decentralized command.

Speaker 1:          00:24:13       Back to the book number two, maneuver warfare means you will not only except confusion and disorder and operate successfully within it through decentralization, you will also generate confusion and disorder. I love that. That's just awesome, right? It's not just saying, hey, look, things are getting confusing, but I'm actually gonna create the confusion. I'm going to make it happen. That's something any when you see the really good you did, you guys have been, Glover does that. Glover creates confusion. He creates ma'am, he creates chaos in the gay, in the, in the match. He wants to scramble to happen. He wants to go as long as possible.

Speaker 2:          00:24:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:50       The reconnaissance pole tactics of the German blitzkrieg, we're inherently disorderly. Now, is this something that's very contrary to what people think of, of the German military and even the German culture? German culture is very orderly and here we say they, the blitzkrieg was inherently disorderly. Back to book higher headquarters could neither direct nor predict the exact path of the advance, but the multitude of German reconnaissance thrust generated massive confusion among the French in 1940 each was reported as a new attack. The Germans seem to be everywhere and the French who system demanded certainty before making any decisions, we're paralyzed.

Speaker 2:          00:25:32       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:25:32       It's, it's very interesting to think about that idea of we all want to have certainty in what's going to happen and how in in battle and in life, if you wait until you're 100% certain, you're probably going to be too late.

Speaker 2:          00:25:47       Mm hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:25:51       Speaking of certainty, three all patterns, recipes and formulas are to be avoided. The enemy must not be able to predict your actions. If you're tactics follow predictable patterns, the enemy can easily cut inside your Ooda loop. If he can predict what you will do, he will be waiting for you. This is why it's so hard to tell someone how to do maneuver warfare. There is no formula you can learn. When someone says, cut all the bull about theory, just tell me what to do. You can't. You can talk about how to think and about some useful techniques, but you can't give new formulas to replace the ones currently taught instead of a checklist or a cookbook. Maneuver warfare requires commanders who can sense more than they can see, who understand the opponent's strengths and weaknesses and their own and who can find the enemy's critical weaknesses in a specific situation.

Speaker 1:          00:26:53       They must be able to create multiple threats and keep the enemy uncertain as to which one is real. They must be able to see their options in the situation before them constantly create new options and shift rapidly among options as the situation develops. General Herman Bulk, one of the most successful practitioners of maneuver warfare said, I'm against the school approach that says in accordance with the ideas of the general staff in this situation, you must do thus and such. On the contrary, you must proceed as dictated by the personalities involved and the particulars of the situation. So he got a German successful German general and he's actually saying you react based not just on the situation of the, of the on the ground, put on the personalities involved. Leadership is an art, my friend.

Speaker 1:          00:27:56       Therefore one of the first principles has to be there can be no fixed schemes. Every scheme, every pattern is wrong. No two situations are identical. That is why the study of military history can be extremely dangerous. Another principle that follows from is from this is never do the same thing twice. Even if something works well for you, once by the second time the enemy will have adapted. So you have to think of something new. No one thinks of becoming a great painter simply by imitating Michelangelo. Similarly, you can't become a great military leader just by imitating someone. It has to come from within. In the last analysis, military command is an art. One man can do it in most will never learn little bit of maneuver warfare and so, so at the, the way the book is broken up, this book is called Maneuver Warfare Handbook. It's, it goes into a, it breaks into a nother section which we're going to get to in a minute, but he kind of goes into a little bit. Linde go now goes into a little bit talking about education and training.

Speaker 2:          00:29:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:21       Back to the book. It is my great and this is a quote is my great inconstant hope that the Marine Corps will produce some outstanding man for this country. Such men are somewhere and they may as well be in our classes is anywhere else. I do not want such a person to be hammered down by narrowness and to have his mind cramped by compulsory details. It is my constant ambition to see the marine officers filled with ambition and initiative and originality and they can get these attributes only by liberal liberality of thought. Broad thought that differs, fought that differs from precedent and the compulsory imprint of others. And that is a long paragraph that says free your mind, free your mind. And I love pointing us out cause this is the marine corps. That's that. That quote is from the commandant of the Marine Corps schools, Brigadier General JC Breckenridge written in 1934 in 1934 he was saying, people, Marine Corps officers don't go by the book, don't obey what other people said he wants them filled with ambition.

Speaker 1:          00:30:43       That's pretty normal, but initiative and originality he's telling to, in order to be a good leader, you got to free your mind. Now, like I said, the book makes a transition from being the, the uh, from being the introduction by, by William Lind about maneuver warfare. And then it slides into another section, which is just about as big in this. This part is called fundamentals of tactics. And this section is written by Colonel Michael D. Wiley, United States Marine Corps. And he ran a course, a of fundamentals of tactics course. And this is sort of the, this is the, this is the notes from the course when he would teach this course, the fundamentals of tactics and a Colonel Wiley, kind of interesting. He went to the, went to the, he was an enlisted marine, then he went to the Naval Academy and he was Jim Webb's company commander in Vietnam, Vietnam. And, and Jim Webb is a fairly famous guy.

Speaker 1:          00:31:54       He was a navy cross winner. He's a now a CEO. He was a senator from Virginia. Um, he wrote a book called fields of fire. And then there's another great book called the Nightingale Song, which is, it follows a couple, five or so. Yeah, I think it's, it's a web, McCain, Oliver North Macfarlane I think. And, and John Poindexter. Anyways, very prominent graduates from the naval academy that all kind of stood out and were, were connected throughout the book. So this guy, so Jim Webb is, this is this kind of a famous guy and guy that wrote this was, was Jim Webb's company commander in Vietnam. So that's kind of, it's a small world and things tied together. So now we get into these lectures that he wrote in. I don't mean to lecture anybody, but hey, they're called lectures in this book. I would just call them free fro information. We're going to learn from it.

Speaker 1:          00:33:01       The first, the first section is called surfaces and gaps. The concept of surfaces and gaps is one of several concepts that bear on tactics. It is unimportant whether you refer to this concept as surfaces and gaps or soft spot tactics or simply the idea of pitting your strength against the enemy's weaknesses. That is what is all about strength against weakness, call it what you will. The term surfaces and gaps is derived from a German term flaking Lucan tactic, which means simply the tactics of surfaces and gaps, the surfaces being the enemy's strong points which we avoid. The gaps being the weak points that we want to go through.

Speaker 1:          00:33:52       Now, Ladelle heart or we talked about already today called it the expanding torrent system tactic. He drew an analogy between attacking and attacking army in a torrent of water. If we watch our torrent bearing down on each successive Bank of earth and dam and its path, we see that it first beats against the obstacle feeling and testing it on all points. Eventually it fall. It finds a small crack through this crack pour the first droplets of water and rush straight on. The pent up water on each side is drawn towards the breach. It's swirls through around the flanks of the breach wearing away the earth on each side and so widening the gap simultaneously. The water behind poor street through that breach between this, the side Eddie's which are wearing away the flanks, direct lead is pass through. It expands to widen once more the on reach of the turn of the torrent. Thus as the water pours through an in and an ever increasing volume, the on reach of the torrent swells to its original proportion, leaving in turn, each crumbling obstacle behind it.

Speaker 2:          00:35:05       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:35:06       long paragraph, but that's how water gets through. Things finds the weak point in piles on the idea of putting surfaces and gaps. Tactics into practice was first implemented by the German army in World War One. This is stuff that every everybody should know, especially military people. In 1918 as they prepared for Luton Dorf spring offensive, the German army changed its offensive tactics. The Germans had found that they were being overpowered by the material available to the British and the French. The Americans were coming and it was clear that Germany was going to lose if she did not do something differently because they did not have the option of matching the allies strength and material, the German society that they would have to out think them. That is they would have to have better tactics. Germany did not succeed in winning the war. It was too late.

Speaker 1:          00:36:00       By this time. They were surrounded, but women and children were starving at home. It was simply too late for them to win. Yet they made some tactical progress there. At the last, at last in the spring of 1918 they inflicted terrible defeats on their enemies to the point that the allied armies were seriously considering the prospect of giving up at the tactical level. The Germans put their strength against weakness. They sought the gaps. Small assault groups called sturm grouping sought gaps in the enemy lines and attack through them assaulting with light machine guns, rifles, grenades and flame throwers. While heavy machine guns direct and indirect weapons, including trench mortars were used to suppress enemy's strong points, but on the strategic level, the spring of 1918 off offensive failed. Why? Because Luton Dorf on that level puts strength against strength. He was seek though he was seeking gaps. He was seeking gaps at the enemy's strong points. That's a very great, great information to have. So yeah, the guys on the ground war attacking the weak points, but the strategic picture, they were still attacking a strong area, so you might've found a little weakness in a wall, a little weakness in the wire, a little weakness in the trench, but they were attacking a, let's say a 20 mile trench that was overall was a strong area, whereas they should have looked for where the flanks are a hundred miles away.

Speaker 1:          00:37:32       Back to the book, the idea of putting strength against weakness was of course born way before 1918 Klaus fits writes about it in chapter nine and 10 of book seven in chapter nine regarding defensive positions. He states the attack cannot prevail against them. It has no means at its disposal to counteract their advantage in practice. Not all defensive positions are like this. If the attacker sees that he can get away without assaulting them, it would be stupid of him not to attempt it. There'll be stupid of him to attempt it. It is a risky business to attack an abl opponent in a good position. Same thing we heard from Sun Tzu. You don't attack heavily defended positions.

Speaker 2:          00:38:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:21       Back to the book. Employment of this concept of surfaces and gaps then gives us many advantages over what could be called slower moving forms of combat, where strength is thrown against strength. Attacking through gaps. Surfaces

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       gives us an advantage of economy of force. If we are pitted. Strength against strength, assaulting enemy's strong points. We are consuming our manpower as well as ammunition to supplies as we go along. If we go through the gaps, we are practicing economy of force. We are reaching our objective without using up our men. We are leaving the enemy behind because we are moving faster. We have the advantage of rapid exploitation, so when you tack obviously tack weaknesses you lose less. Be Lose less men.

Speaker 5:          00:39:11       Now this is important. The concept of surfaces and gaps demands leadership from the front as opposed to leadership from the rear. The commander must be where he can make swift decisions. He must be where the situation is developing. Obviously leadership from the front had become a scarcity in world war one. JFC follower in his book, General Ship wrote in the World War. Nothing was more dreadful to witness that a chain of men starting with a battalion commander and ending with the army commander sitting in telephone boxes improvised or actual talking, talking, talking in place of leading, leading, leading. The result was unresponsive leadership and slow reactions. We actually talked about this on the last podcast when Leif was talking about being in an assault force and being in the assault train, which is 20 guys, 15 or 20 guys and he was standing always at the end of the train cause that's where he was told he was supposed to be in. He didn't know what's going on the front so he couldn't help. He couldn't make any decisions. If someone was going to, if he needed to make a decision, well we couldn't even make a decision because you know what's going on up there. But if someone said, hey, we need a decision from the boss, they had to pass that word all the way back,

Speaker 3:          00:40:29       not good,

Speaker 5:          00:40:32       so you got to lead from the front with decentralized command and be far enough the phone. I don't want to make it sound that simple. You've got to be, it's the same thing we talked about, like if you've got to be far enough forward that you can understand what's happening up there and obviously you, but you don't want to be the guy that's doing the shooting cause then you've gone too far forward to actually be detached and make decisions. Certainly combat is not going to be that simple. The gap then might be any undefended point or any weekly defended point. It may be any enemy vulnerability. It might be the enemies of flanks. The term flank itself needs some elaboration. Think of it as a relative thing. John Boyd defines a flank as that aspect of that aspect. Toward which a force is not devoting its primary attention. In other words and fluid warfare, what is one moment the enemy's flank might the next moment be the enemy's front? It depends on how he is directing his attention. A gap for the infantry could be an enemy missile site, manned by troops or not combat oriented. The missile site might be a surface if you are flying on an airplane, but a gap if you were a light infantry men who has gotten inside and me lines.

Speaker 5:          00:41:52       So,

Speaker 4:          00:41:53       okay,

Speaker 5:          00:41:54       does that make sense to you? So if you've got, if you've got a surface to air missile,

Speaker 4:          00:41:58       okay,

Speaker 5:          00:41:59       launcher and it, it has a radar radar on it and it can track aircraft coming in. And if you're a a fighter aircraft, you don't want to say what do you want to stay away from that thing because it'll get you locked on railroad is going to fire a heat seeking missile that you and kill you. So for them it's a surface. It's a strong point. For an aircraft it's a strong point. But for a ground troop, they don't put, you know, the highest level troops guarding these things cause they're in the rear a little bit. They put like kind of, you know, some what they call them here. Uh, they're manned by troops who are not combat oriented. So that means it's a softer target. Yeah. Back to the book. Let us say we are unsuccessful in finding any gaps.

Speaker 4:          00:42:44       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:42:44       we may have to create gaps and there are ways of doing this. So then they talk about the ways you can do it. You can do it through fire power, but dropping bombs by suppression, by assault, all those different ways to create gaps with, with, you know, using direct fire to soften up targets. And then I like these tactics a little bit better. Another way of creating gaps is through supporting attacks. By attacking one point along the line, we may divert the enemy from another point and by drawing them off, create a gap. Again, this isn't linear terms for instructional purposes, for simplicity, but do not get a linear mindset. Sometimes a less costly way of creating a gap is through deception by causing the enemy to think that we will attack at one point there by enticing him to draw his forces off from another point. And when he attack that point where he has weakened herself. But what do we do about surfaces that his strong points, sometimes they are best bypassed once the enemy has been bypassed, his strong point may be cutoff from its support and in that way his strong point eventually withers away and becomes a weak point, which we can attack later.

Speaker 4:          00:44:02       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:44:03       You know, we talk a lot in here about not attacking people's defensible positions. And this is just a classic, another way of saying that, you know, some we, we talk about people with got the ego, the big ego and how you don't want to confront that ego. Well, if you can bypass the ego, eventually the ego doesn't become a factor anymore. And that's the same thing when you're doing ground combat.

Speaker 5:          00:44:25       Back to the book. There are certain problems presented by the concept of surfaces and gaps, especially to commanders who are to slow moving forms of combat. One is that the commander will not always know where all his people are. In the Marine Corps. We become used to being accountable at all times for knowing exactly where every man is in this faster moving form of combat to do so would be impossible. Your subordinates or finding the gaps and exploiting them. So you've got you've, you're a control freak. You're not going to be able to pull this off cause I'm saying well where are you echo, where are you echo where are you know, echoes out there. He's working, he's finding some gaps to get through, not know exactly where he is. Another problem is that artillery in air might not be, may not be controlled as closely as is possible and slowing slower moving forms of combat.

Speaker 5:          00:45:18       So you start to deal with the problems of, of air support. And artillery is a little trickier to use because you have people moving around the battlefield and you're not sure where everyone is and that makes it very difficult because you obviously don't want to drop bombs on your own people. Another problem associated with the concept of surfaces and gaps is that as we penetrate deeply, often on narrow fronts, our flanks become exposed. There are however compensating factors, again related to speed, we are moving quickly. The enemy is always off balance. Remember the old adage there is security in speed, so in other words, as you penetrate into a, into a zone, you're going to be exposed a little bit, but if you're moving fast, you can deal with that exposure.

Speaker 5:          00:46:08       Critics of these faster moving forms of combat characterized by initiative at the low level fear that they will lead groups, two groups of men moving willy nilly about the battlefield and that commanders will lose control. So people say, Oh, you know, if I give so much, so much initiative at the low level, if I'm going to lose control of it, then people are going to be running around like chickens with their heads cut off this need not be. So if the concept of surfaces and gaps is employed properly, it will not be. So that is why we have control measures the boundary, the limit of advanced the phase line can still be used. It must be remembered that these control measures should serve their function but not be rigid lines that cannot be changed or ignored. When the situation changes, they should be kept to a minimum and must always be flexible. The tactics must never follow the control measures. On the contrary, the control measures must follow the tactics and the tactics must always be based on the enemy. Other concepts that will be discussed in the chapters ahead, especially that of the main effort gives us meaning, gives us means of keeping control over our troops and preventing a situation where they can be said to be moving willy nilly about the battlefield. So decentralized command it. It is challenging and if you don't do it right, you will have chaos.

Speaker 5:          00:47:40       So now we get into the next section and it does say lecture again, but again, I'm not here to lecture anybody. I don't think I, I don't think I can pull that off. The concept, this one, this section is called mission tactics. The concept of mission tactics like surfaces and gaps must always be at work in battle. The name is the name is derived from the German Alf trags tactic, which means literally mission tactics. It is no accident that the name includes the word tactics. Assigning a mission and depending on subordinates to carry it out constitutes the tactic to allow the subordinate to decide on his own initiative what to do is the means of getting the most appropriate decisions made on the spot and acted on more rapidly than the enemy can respond to your actions. Got to get your subordinate leadership to lead. You want them to lead. This is the account of Prince Frederick Charles, who is giving a tongue lashing to one of his majors for committing a tactical blunder in defense of his action. The major explained that he was only following orders in the Prussian army. The major reminded the prints and order from a senior officer was tantamount to an order from the king.

Speaker 5:          00:49:08       The prince was unimpressed. His reply to the major was the king made you a major because he thought you were smart enough to know when not to obey orders.

Speaker 5:          00:49:20       Then that is the essence of mission tactics. The subordinate decides what to do even if even if it means that the order issued by his senior now should be changed or adjusted. The mission assigned is sacred. The mission is the output that the commander wants. That does not change, but how that output is to be achieved may change and it is up to the intelligent subordinate to decide whether or not it has total freedom for the subordinate leadership to figure out how they want to make this happen. They know what they need to get done, but they, they have the freedom to figure out how they're going to make it happen. Back to the book, there is a classic example. Use Time and time again and introducing the student to mission tactics. It is simple and a value so it will be used again. Here the subordinate is giving the mission of getting his unit across the river.

Speaker 5:          00:50:22       Getting these unit across the river is the output. The senior desires, the that he has been given crosses the nearest bridge. The junior commander arrives at the site to find that the bridge has been destroyed. He does not stop. He does not wait for new orders. He does not request permission to change his route. He goes to the nearest Ford several kilometers distance, and he crosses there. He informed the senior, of course, as soon as he can, but he does not wait. Remember, mission orders are necessary to give the tempo of operations, the rapidity that it must have if we are to keep the enemy off balance. So that's a very simple example. I tell Echo, hey, I need your, I need your troops across that river. Go across that bridge. You get there, the bridges out. You're like, oh, I'm still going to get across the river.

Speaker 5:          00:51:09       Here's, let's find a put into the place we can go across or let's make it happen. And you're gonna make it happen. Not going to bother me. You're not going to call me back. [inaudible] hey, the bridges out. What you want me to do now that something that, this is a little bit, this is a little bit simplified because the reality is if you are going to start moving kilometers away from where I anticipated you being, you need to tell me that you're moving. You need to tell me, cause I might have other friendly units in the area that might, IX don't expect you, I might have be dropping bombs in that area. So this is, this is actually leaving out some critical coordination that does have to happen, but the initiative to make it happen should happen. Yeah, it seems like you, um, like in the, in the process of that decentralized command, the person carrying out the order is, it's kind of tis discretion how much he's going to deviate when something changes.

Speaker 5:          00:51:59       Like he can't, he's, of course he's going to deviate. He's going to make those adjustments, but you don't want to deviate too much. Right. And honestly, if I was to give you the directions, hey echo, I need you to go on a car. I need you cross the river. I would literally give you some parameters to work within. I'd say, don't go, don't go further south in this area then this road and don't go further north and this, you can do whatever you want inside of here. So now you can do it and you can do whatever you want inside that box. Yeah. And how you always talk about you'll, you'll say like, why are you going across the river as well?

Speaker 5:          00:52:29       And speaking of y, and here's another example of mission orders. This is an actual example. Seize control of route six west of the muddy river in order to destroy enemy forces, attempting to escape from company Bravo's zone of action. So it's telling you the why, that's what the, in order to his notice in the mission order, the phrase in order to that is a very important phrase and usually ought to go in the mission order. There's no rule that every mission order contain the phrase in order to, if you were told attack the enemy company that you see in front of you would probably be highly superfluous to tell you why they are there. They are a threat. Why waste the breath, but usually your mission order, we'll have the ability to endure time better. If you explained the subordinate why he is carrying the mission out. So you called this echo, turn into little tactical genius over there, aren't you? In order to, this gives the order, the quality that Erich von Man Stein called longterm. It can endure the test of time. Your commander can lose communication with you, yet you can still carry out his intent because you know what he wanted and you can continue to act within his intent for a long time without checking back. Understanding the why as briefed by Lieutenant Colonel Echocharles.

Speaker 4:          00:54:01       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:54:02       Fixed rules are not appropriate in instructing how to us, how to assign missions. Too often students reject good ideas about tactics because they cannot get their thoughts to fit the format of the operation order that is being demanded. The important thing is that the mission be clear compared to clarity format is of little or no consequence. And this is, we talk about it in an extreme ownership, these massive PowerPoint briefs that, I mean hundreds literally, you know, a hundred, 150 slides to try and make the, to try and brief a mission when in the leaders would waste so much time trying to put these briefs together and, and they would, they wouldn't do the planning where they're supposed to be doing. They wouldn't be thinking they be building PowerPoint slides and I've just had to get these guys to think and stop, stop working on the, and I'm trying to match your font chop, trying to equalize the Hughes on each slide to make it look pretty.

Speaker 5:          00:55:05       No, don't care. What I want you to do is think, and I want clear clarity of mission as the most important thing. The matter of fact, I had one guy was running training and, and a guy says to me, it's one of the, one of the tasks you new commanders. And he says, Hey, you know, what is it? What is it that you're looking for in the brief? And he's, you know, trying to figure out how many slides do I want to see and what format do I want to see? And I said, what I want for the brief is that your men understand the operation.

Speaker 4:          00:55:32       Boom.

Speaker 5:          00:55:38       Back to the book, the subordinate receiving that order must be more talented. Amateur troops, awkward, clumsy, untrained troops cannot be expected to carry out mission orders. Why? Because as a result of their lack of experience, they must be told what to do. Only the professional experience leader can know what to do without being told what to do. Because we in the Marine Corps, set our standards high. We expected our subordinates will train until they can perform under mission orders. So just, I don't know if I made this clear or if I breezed over this park. Mission orders is exactly what we're talking about when it comes to, hey, just tell the person, this is what I need done and this is why I want it done. You figured out, as opposed to telling them exactly what you them to do. Commander's intent. Yes, indeed. Commander's intent,

Speaker 5:          00:56:30       burdens of responsibility increase on both sides on the part of the senior committed. So when you're doing mission orders, the burden of responsibility increases on the part of the senior commander and on the part of the subordinate look first at the senior commander operating with mission orders, his orders must be perfectly clear. The onus is on the senior to define to the junior what must be accomplished without telling him how to do it. The onus is not on the junior to ferret out what his commander wants. The senior must state what he wants, otherwise he should not expect to get it. Now, I actually, when I, when I teach people this, I tell them that the onus is on the junior. And if, if I tell you to do something and you don't understand why you're doing it and you don't understand what my intent is and you still go on the field and try and do it, I blame you. I mean, it's my fault too, but we're both taking ownership. Might even say we're taking extreme ownership of the situation. But really if your boss isn't telling you why your why your why they're telling you to do something, you just raise your hand and ask, Hey boss, what's your objective here? What's your overall intent? What's the commander's intent? Because I want to make sure if I lose communications with you, I can continue to execute towards your desired end state. That's what we're looking for. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          00:57:47       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:57:48       An additional burden of responsibility on the seniors that he must train his subordinates and his unit to operate as a team. They are not going to be able to perform mission orders without training another new boarding of responsibilities that he must expect his subordinates to make mistakes. He may not expect zero defects. Wars are won by people, not machines. People make mistakes. If people are more afraid of making mistakes than they are of exercising initiative now and then they will not take risks and they will not exercise initiative. Furthermore, they will not win in war.

Speaker 5:          00:58:26       Perhaps the most important new responsibility that is placed on the commander who gives mission orders is that he must trust his subordinates. If trust breaks down, the whole system breaks down. So people ask me about trust from time to time. And it's absolutely, and I use, I talk about relationships, The r word, and that's what, that's what, that's what it is. And Lafe and I talked about the other day on the podcast is that just building trust, how the one of the best ways to build trust as give it, I give it. And so that's what it goes back and forth. And in the military you do that when you're in the training environment, when there's no risk or very, very tiny risk of life and limb, there's no strategic lift and you're not, you'd risk, you're not gonna lose the war. So I'm going to let you run with stuff. I want you to learn. I want you to take risks. And if you fail, if you screw something up, I don't try and fire you. We try and learn from it. And that encourages you to take initiative and keep getting after it.

Speaker 4:          00:59:29       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:59:30       Now the, the, we're moving to the next section.

Speaker 4:          00:59:36       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:59:36       Which is called the main effort. The commander in making his plan must determine what and where his main effort is in every operation, whether it be offensive, defensive, or withdrawal. This main effort should be specified in the operation order. It should always be clearly stated in paragraph three a the concept of operation. There can only be one main effort. When you start giving two or three or a three part main effort, you'd better look back at it because the chances are you do, you have not made up your mind what you are trying to do. So if you're trying to plan a mission, you, you're telling, you're telling people there's three main things we're trying to get done. No, wrong. Yep. There should be one.

Speaker 6:          01:00:28       Yup. Yeah, in message, convenience. Um, actually I think it's the newspaper writing. They call it burying the lead. So like your main story has to, you know, you can't have three main stories in one article. Got It. Because, and you know, one story is going to have cool details, right? Right. But you start spending a bunch of time on these cool details. They call that burying the lead. It's a bad deal done

Speaker 5:          01:00:56       do that. Don't do the newspaper business and don't do that on battlefield. Every unit commander down to the company commander will always assign a main effort and sometimes even a platoon commander should the entire command must be aware of what and where the main effort is. The commander can change the main effort at any time. This is what gives the operation its fluidity in in. This is one of the pretty common issues that we run. It ran into it when I was running training run into it. Now in the business world where you've worked with a company and they're not, they're not assigning a main effort. There were concentrating on 14 different things at the same time. They don't prioritize and execute this. This is another form of prioritize and execute and that's a problem because if you're trying to do 14 things at once, you're going to not accomplish any of them.

Speaker 5:          01:01:52       The German word for main effort is shared, pumped anytime in your readings. When you see that and often you will see it written in metallics. The German word strip punked. Take Note, because it is one of the most important underlying concepts in everything the Germans do. Make the main effort where the enemy least expects you. Make the enemy. Make the main effort where the enemy is weak. Be prepared to be surprised. So let's go. I gotta, I gotta stop right there. It's interesting. You know when you see the big fortified area of the enemy, you see, okay, we're going to, we better, we better attack that hard. No wrong answer. That's a surface. We're looking for gaps. So don't make the main effort that the strong point, make it the weak point back to the book. Be Be prepared to be surprised. Be Leery of the council. Do not ever be surprised in war. You will be surprised. The task is to learn to deal with surprise. If what you thought would be an enemy, weakness becomes the enemy strength. You should not be disrupted. If your taxes tactics are fluid, you can deal with surprise. You will shift your main effort to enemy weakness and go on through. That is how the main effort works in the office.

Speaker 4:          01:03:15       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:03:15       fluidity. Remember we've been hearing a lot about in the Vietnam war, the Viet Cong were too rigid. They would just try, their plan didn't have the fluidity. The main efforts should be directed against enemy weakness, not enemies. Strength. Here you see the interconnection between the concepts, the con connection between the concept of the main effort and the concept of surfaces and gaps. All the concepts work together at the same time. The main effort cannot be understood in isolation from surfaces and gaps because it is directed against enemy weakness.

Speaker 4:          01:03:51       Okay,

Speaker 5:          01:03:52       and another, another one of the four laws combat that we talk about in the book. Extreme ownership is simplicity. Simple back to the book. Even the principal of simplicity can be recognized in the concept of the main effort. Instead of trying to do 10 different things, we are focusing on one. There will be many other efforts going on at the same time, but all in some way directed at making the main efforts succeed. So what do you gain from this main effort? You gain direction, you great, you gain fluidity, you gain speed, and you prevent dissipating your efforts all over the battlefield. The way the polls did when the Germans invaded Poland, they tried to defend their entire 800 mile front. There was no main effort and by trying to be strong everywhere, they weren't fact strong. Nowhere this trying to cover all the bases is a common error in the amateur commanders plan.

Speaker 5:          01:04:54       It is a symptom of avoidance of decision making, avoidance of decision making. So if you're not saying, hey, here's what we're going to focus on, your, you're just, wow, I'm going to wait. I don't want to decide yet. No, I'm not ready to commit. By establishing a main effort, you make a clear decision. You obviate the necessity for junior officers to keep asking for guidance. If they know their commanders made effort, they can continue to operate even though communications may be cut and they can continue to operate at a high tempo because they need not keep checking back for new orders.

Speaker 5:          01:05:35       And here we get to a another something you might recognize from from our book, extreme ownership. When the commander has made this decision, he has done something very necessary. He has done something very ethical. He is assumed and taken responsibility for what will happen if the battle goes awry. He cannot blame his subordinates. He can only blame himself. It was key who decided what was to be done and designated a main effort in order to do it. Therefore, it takes courage and moral character decides to select a main effort. That is why the weak commander and the amateur so often fail to do this. In fact, the weak commander will actively avoid choosing a main effort is very convenient for the commander weekend character to avoid selecting the main effort because if the battle goes on favorably, he can blame someone else for the mistake. The commander who has taken the stand and selected his own main effort cannot do this. Therefore, in a sense, the main effort is a moral commitment. Taking some ownership by selecting the main effort and you'd get a dig that,

Speaker 3:          01:06:57       okay,

Speaker 5:          01:07:00       the next concept in, again, you know him, I'm cruising through this book like I always do. Only reading, I don't know, probably a very small percentage of it, 15% and there's a ton in here. It actually has some very cool uh, like exercises where it gives you a scenario that's happening and you go through when you figured out what you would do and it gives you a good solution. So it's got, it's got, it's a great book to look at. The next lecture is called the concept of the objective. According to this chair do according to the Joint Chiefs of staff publication number one dictionary of military and associated terms. The objective is the physical object of the action taken a definite tactical feature seizure and are holding of which is essential to the commanders plan. That definition is clear enough. Bazell Odell heart would have disagreed with the JCS definition had one point in his writings. Ladelle heart stated the only real objective is the enemy. The Dell hearts statement is also quite clear and especially when we realize that whether we are attacking or defending the problem is always the enemy. Once the enemy has taken out of the action, defending and attacking or no longer necessary.

Speaker 4:          01:08:32       Now

Speaker 5:          01:08:34       the, the, the, I guess the controversy here, if we could call it that, is the objective not being a specific piece of terrain. It's the, the objective is the enemy. But that being said, the terrain of course is extremely important. We must use it to gain advantage, but the object of the attack is the enemy. The objective must be to take the enemy out of action to destroy him, to disarm him. We cannot not do that simply by seizing a piece of training, holding it. We must be prepared to move continually wherever necessary to confuse and disrupt him through a combination of fire and movement. When the term objective appears, it means an aiming point. That towards which we direct our efforts in order to best use the terrain to accomplish our final goal, the destruction of the enemy,

Speaker 5:          01:09:35       the ability to wisely select an objective is the mark of a good commander. The inability is the mark of an amateur and history is replete with examples of poorly selected objectives. There were hills fought for bravely by marines in Vietnam after they ceased being of any tactical value. Lives were thrown away from meaningless terrain. Terrain that did not meet either of the two main criteria for selecting an objective. The two main criteria are one that is loot, that it'd be useful to you or to dear to your enemy. If it is neither one of these, it is probably not worth the life of a single marine and good commander will therefore select terrain that is useful to him. The great commander will have the ability to select terrain that is dear to the enemy. In the final concept is the concept of the reserve, General JFC follower of the British army. The original author of the nine principles of war that the US army was to adopt in the 1920s once stated that of all the principles he developed, the most important was economy of force. He reasoned that whichever side still had forces left after the other sides had been committed, was bound to win. Napoleon seems to have had similar thoughts when he observed that whoever's still had his reserve remaining after his enemy had committed his reserve would win the battle.

Speaker 5:          01:11:19       And here's another quote in here from Napoleon that I think when they're talking about committing, and it talks about your mindset on the battlefield from Napoleon, if I appear to be always ready to reply to everything it is because before undertaking anything, I have meditated for a long time. I have foreseen what might happen. It is not a spirit which suddenly reveals to me what I have to say or do in a circumstances, in a circumstance, unexpected by others. It is reflection, a meditation. So Napoleon, he was good to have these quick reactions and everyone says, wow, he must've just had this incredible, you know, he's calling a spirit. This comes to him and says, Hey, move these guys over here. Hey, assault that flank. No. Here. He fought through this thing for hours and he said, Oh, if they do this, I'm gonna do that. If they come over here, I'll move you. Ready over here.

Speaker 4:          01:12:19       Hmm.

Speaker 5:          01:12:21       Preparation. What Napoleon was saying was that thorough thought in advance prepared him to make split second decisions when the situation suddenly changed.

Speaker 4:          01:12:38       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:12:39       Preparation. Preparation is key.

Speaker 4:          01:12:44       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:12:47       Now. That wraps up the book and I hope that it provides some reminders and some insight to people not only to the war fighters out on the battlefield, but as I said in the beginning, I hope it provides some details into dealing with humans, with people and problems in the business world, in leadership positions on that, Jiu Jitsu, Matt, in life, whatever you're doing or whatever you're trying to get done. Think of how you can use maneuver warfare to make it happen. I guess we cannot go over to some, some questions from the interwebs and I guess before we go to the interwebs, maybe you could tell us about the inner webs and what we can do to support support by being on the interwebs. If you're on the interwebs and you're in the mood to support this podcast and or yourself with supplementation, go to on it.com/jocko get on it. Supplements are the best ones. I like that idea. Yeah, that's a good idea. Krill oil for sure, for your joints, get tough. Bring some of that Alpha

Speaker 7:          01:14:12       brainy shroom tech sport mode. Yeah, shroom tech sport. If you're into performance, physical activity performance, if you feel you need a little turbo boost. Yeah, it was funny. Remember Tim Kennedy put it in like real, real good terms in my opinion when he use like, oh yeah, when I took the shroom tech, it's kind of like, cause okay, so you don't want to get confused and be like, Hey, I'm gonna take the shroom tech in. It's like a, like a caffeine boost or something. You know, you don't because it's not, that's not so it's an, and he put it in these terms where he's like, you know, he, you go a few rounds, you go five, six, seven, eight, you know, however many rounds and everyone's like real poop. But then you're kind of like, I can go a few more routes. And really that is exactly how it is this room.

Speaker 7:          01:14:57       But when you're hitting towards the end of the round or whatever, it's like you feel solid, you know, it just, I guess apparently what it does is it helps you utilize your oxygen consumption. You'll find a site or whatever. I mean, obviously you're talking about Jujitsu, which for those people that don't train Jujitsu, which you should, but if you don't, well you should, but you are also going to keep working out and you have the, you know, you, so sort of a metabolic conditioning type type of workout situation going on. That's true. Remember how I was telling you I did my met come metabolic conditioning after I like normal lifting. So person doing the reverse of that lately. Really. I Dunno, I would advise Alan super warmed up. I'm dripping with sweat. Yeah. And I feel really good and I figure maybe the opposite will happen because we both know if you go with your, with your strength movements first you tick a little bit off your met construct.

Speaker 7:          01:15:48       Right? Yeah. If, if you do. And so that way when you do the metcon fresh, you feel like Superman, right? Cause you're yeah. Blasted your muscles out. So I've been doing the reverse though. What? I'm doing the metcon type first and then I just breathe it out and then I get into the heavy stuff. Yeah. And I dig it on. The only reason I say I dig it because you're a savage like that. But consider cause those are two, well it depends. It depends on what kind of lifting you're doing. So let's say if not, well if you're lifting like for strength or or you know, muscle growth or whatever, you should do that first because the results that you seek are inline with you having full energy. You lifting. I agree with you. I actually think you're correct. And the METCON isn't, the results of the metcon is for you to recover from conditioning.

Speaker 7:          01:16:36       So he, it's muscular conditioning. So if you're tired going in, that's more conditioning. You have to recover from better exercise. So it slowed essentially. But Hey, if you want to reverse it, give your body some, some, some stuff to show. Cause I, I completely agree with you and I've only been doing this for a couple months and I, or you know what it was, you don't know. It was one day I was, I was in, I did like a metcon was pretty strong feeling good. Sure. And then I got done. I said I need a little bit more. So I was like, I'm just going to move some, you know, some, some heavy get my liftoff. And when I, when I

Speaker 5:          01:17:10       went heavy I was like, man, that feels good. Right? All loose them all warm. And so now I've just kind of started doing it a little bit.

Speaker 6:          01:17:17       Yeah. And if you get used to that, then it, it'll start to be more and more benefit. I used to, I used to run on the treadmill. I used to do like three and a half miles, someone's four miles and then Lyft, just because I didn't have time and I, every time I lift that I would never feel like running the, you know, the mileage afterwards. I do it on a treadmill and sweat. So I'd be like, you know what, I'm going to get the, the running out of the way that I'm going to lift. And then I was like, Dang, lifting is, it's kind of harder, but I'd way rather endure this discomfort when I'm lifting. Then when I'm running on the treadmill. But I did that for months and months and months. And then one day I didn't run. I was like, it was weird.

Speaker 6:          01:17:49       It was like stiff. Yeah. So you kinda get used to it. But either way. I mean, my original point is w I w I do the met now. I do the math on after I left during the metcon, after I live. That has been my standard for so long. Right. But you know how you'd say do the metcon before you lift or, or you're just doing the metcon that day. It's easier because you're not as tired from lifting. Yeah. Yeah. But, um, anyway, my, my original point was the shroom tech. So if you're doing that kind of thing after you lift, when you're going into the metcon, you're going to feel way better.

Speaker 5:          01:18:21       You want to hear something cool. So a lot of times people ask me, what is your workout? Right. They want to know reps sets weights. Yeah. Right. Yeah. That's cool. Of course. Um, and I haven't, I haven't put it out there for [inaudible]. I got a book. I'm putting together a book that's going to have book kind of thing. Yeah. She's not going to be, the ebooks can be a real book. Hardcover. Yeah. I like a real legit book on, um, which means going to take a little more time, but I'd rather do it and do it right. But what's interesting is this is what's so cool. So people that, people that listen to podcasts and asking it hadn't been applying the basic principles because I have never put it, I haven't put out, I don't think I've put out a single workout. Also, people say, what do you actually eat?

Speaker 5:          01:19:14       Right? They want to know what I had for breakfast, lunch, dinner, what I had for snacks, whatever. All I say is like, Oh, you know, I mostly, you know, Aye. Aye. Aye. Low, very low carbs. I eat a lot of meat. I do a lot of protein. I need a lot of fat. Okay, what do you do for workouts? I get up early in the morning, I hit it hard, you know, am I doing squats and doing pull ups and doing, did basic stuff. Right. And I've put those basic principles out there. Well, there's people troopers that had been applying these basic principles and they're making incredible progress in their lives. They're getting stronger, they're getting leaner, they're getting in better shape. So it's actually proven, cause I remember you and I talked about this as long time ago. I said, listen, it's more about the commander's intent, right? The working I was about the commander's intent. It's not about, I'm going to tell you how many reps and sets to do, I'm going to tell you what you want to

Speaker 7:          01:20:08       make happen, right? I'm going to tell you where you want, where you want to be at the end of this workout physically and mentally and, and people have been taking that. And I mean all kinds of people, they have lost 28 pounds. I've lost 42 pounds just from applying the basic principles that I, and and so those will be consolidated in the book so that people can follow them. And there'll be some other good stuff in the book too. Basic philosophy of couple philosophy. Yeah. Well that was kind of a tangent on, on it, wasn't it? Well aid, rightly so. I think right, that he, so I think it's, it's convenient, right? Which, which actually kind of brings me to my point that consistency is probably the most overlooked. That even though people know, yeah, you gotta be consistent. We got an a, but that's kind of everything because everything else is variable.

Speaker 7:          01:20:59       Like you can, you can see there's a billion different work consistency. Do you mean doing the same thing or you just mean doing it every day? Getting in there and yeah, absolutely not skipping days, weeks, you know, getting off the horse, you know, that kind of stuff. There's a million different workouts you can do that will give you results and there's a million different results that you can, you can kind of strive for and get him cause it just so many. Same thing with diet, like you can, you know, people have their rigid diet philosophy, but the fact is that many different diets work. Yeah. I mean there's some basic principles. You don't need a bunch of sugar. You don't need a bunch of fast food. You don't, you know, the obvious things to avoid and you can get results with many kinds of data and I would go one step further or what you're talking about is consistency in, in order to have consistency that requires the distance.

Speaker 7:          01:21:56       It does require the discipline. So that's the key factor. That is the key factor. And when people apply the discipline to their lives, boom, right now we got you. Becomes consistent and that's everything. Yep. So the books can comment in. The books can talk about that. There you go. Boom. How well it's going to support the podcast. If you, before you do your Amazon shopping, go to Jocko podcast.com or or one of the websites, chocolate store.com. Click on the Amazon link and do your shopping. You getting support passively and you can install that little tool or you can just make it your foot fit year up. I put it in my, my, what's that called up at the top of bookmarks? Bookmark. Just so when I click on Amazon, it's already the Jaguar. Yeah, yeah, exactly. That's what I, yeah, we go crazy with Amazon and housing units.

Speaker 7:          01:22:46       So awesome. And don't call it a little tool. It's not a little tool. Oh, that's right. It's the trooper tool. It's a big deal. It's pretty little technically. It's really, anyway, the trooper tool that Brady made, little things for that again. Yeah. Little small tool. Simple. Um, you go and you can go on the and get it. It's called the Jocko podcast trooper tool. Chrome extension. What it all it does, it makes it easy to support podcasts when you do your Amazon shopping, so you don't have to remember that and it, you know, it basically you click on it, do you want this tool? Click yes. Boom. It's on your little browser. There. It automatically directly to our, our affiliate link, which senior support that way. And it's kind of cool little icon if you, if you, um, yeah, when you do it, this little icon there, it makes it official, but you can hide the icon if you don't want it to decide if he knows what, if you don't want it, and I understand it if you don't.

Speaker 7:          01:23:37       Yeah. It's telcos face, but you know, yeah. The trooper tool. That's a, that's a good one. That's good. Easy, easy way. Because remembering to go to the website and click through before you do, you know how like you're, yeah. You know, you just like Amazon or it's, you know, I want this thing, I want that duct tape. Nope. Nope. Same Day deal. Yeah, that's true. So anyway, now you've got the trooper tool. Boom. Easy, easy. Um, also all the, obviously by subscribing to the podcast if you haven't already owns a good way to support. Yeah, absolutely. And um, the Jocko store, that's a good one. I think if you like shirts that say discipline equals freedom. Most people do have to wear shirts at some juncture during the day. Sure. You can't get into the restaurant without attention. Uncle I use sometimes accepted, but yeah, there's some shirts on there. If you like them, get a shirt. That's a good way to support or a bumper sticker. Elections coming up. Chocolate toilet, six days.

Speaker 7:          01:24:40       Yeah. I saw a car with Jocko 2016 on it. Did you know the purpose today? Is it in San Diego? Yeah, Chris Martin, but still it's cool to see. You know when you pull up you're like, oh, that's Chris Martin's car. Anyway, it looked cool. He has a nice car too, by the way, so it looked extra cool. You know, it was like extra official. Yeah. We got some real supporter. That's what it felt like. Also, subscribe to the Youtube Channel and you posted your first, I'm starting to put it, it's a, it's a deleted scene. Does it? Difference can be tight on those deleted scene. If you want to hear Echo Charles talking about the keys being abduction. It's my kids podcasts. There are about alien abduction. There's a lot of podcasts about it. Is that a son and I have glory cause now we're going to fit in that subcategory.

Speaker 7:          01:25:31       Leadership war darkness and alien abduction. Maybe that's why it's an outtake that was more like an example underlying kind of thing. It was more about my children's book idea. Okay. We're good. We're good. Anyway, those are the ways. Yep. [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko that's a good one. Like I said for the supplement, 10% off. I forgot to mention that. If you don't know 10% off the supplements. Yeah. Good. I guess with that, let's get down to the questions from the troopers on the interwebs. Get a lot of questions lately that I like it. I like it too. First question, Jocko, if you were coaching Mcgregor for those, don't know, that's Conor Mcgregor, UFC fighter, what would you focus on to try and make up the Jujitsu disparity? All defense. Hmm, interesting. And if you don't know what's going on,

Speaker 7:          01:26:34       Conor McGregor is fighting Nate Diaz again, two oh two UFC. So a lot of times I don't like to talk about this kind of thing because it's, by the time this comes out, it'll be you. By the time you're listening to this might be over, don't care anymore. But there is a, a principal here at concept behind this that does make sense to try and discuss so people can learn and improve. And something for me to think about my game. So you've got this guy who's a really good striker going against a guy who's a pretty good striker himself. Very good. Yeah, very good. And that's one of the things that this is, this is the question, the way it sets it up, as if Jujitsu is the, is the only thing that Nate Diaz is better at, that might not necessarily be the truth. And in fact, in their first fight, it was the striking of Nate Diaz that forced Conor McGregor to shoot a sloppy takedown, take it to ground. And once he got on the ground, the Jujitsu from Nate Diaz was just way too much for, for Mcgregor. So this question,

Speaker 7:          01:27:46       it's almost a little bit off because the question shouldn't be that there's just a Jujitsu disparity. The question should be, you know, what is, how would you make up for the fighting disparity? Or maybe not even that. It's, how would you go against, what would you tell Connor? What would you work at all this strategy? So let's just look at it as an overall strategic question. You've got a guy that's pretty, that's what, what, what is he good at? That's the question of what is he going to, one of the strengths of Conor McGregor, he's fast, he's strong, but strong might not even come to play because our Diaz as walking around at 200 pounds right now they're finding one's 70. So he's gonna have to cut a lot of weight. He's going to be big and strong. He's going to be a better shape for this fight. Uh, Connor is pretty good with some unorthodox stuff. His striking is fast and fairly dynamic. So those are the things that he has going for him. What does Nate Diaz have going for him? His jujitsu is really good, really good at it, too sick. His striking his, especially his boxing, he did not a big kicker. So if I was, if I was McGregor, here's what I'd be doing. I mean, what? I'd be working my wrestling, we'll be working on under hooks, of course,

Speaker 5:          01:29:02       in, in getting control and getting back to my feet when I get taken down immediately getting back to my feet, the way I would fight if I was Conor McGregor is I would back off with the hard punches. I would throw a lot of really fast light punches and I move around a lot and just try and touch and go. That's what I do. If I was Conor Mcgregor, I would possibly starting in the middle of the second round, the third round, five round fight, I might start throwing some leg kicks. He doesn't, Nate sometimes doesn't even check leg kicks so maybe you can start putting on hurting on him if you, if you throw enough of those. But in Jujitsu wise I would teach him to disengage, disengage cause you don't want to go. You don't want to get in the Ooda loop, wouldn't he? That Mcgregor does not want to get in an ou to loop situation with with ds because he can't keep up with him.

Speaker 5:          01:30:05       He'll be, he'll be changing. There'll be going to the next thing, going to the next thing, go to the next thing to the next thing and condom Burgerlands get caught behind and heal. Won't be able to do it. So I teach them to get now one thing that does make Jujitsu a little bit harder if you're, if you and I are doing Jujitsu and your goal, you're not trying you, you actually disengage from me and you're just like your whole goal. If we were on the mat shook hands, slapped, bump and we're going to roll and all you did try to do is stay away from me, it would be a really hard round for me. It would be harder than if you attacked me. Yeah. It's harder than if you attacked me and when I did take you down, all you did was try and get back up.

Speaker 5:          01:30:40       You didn't try and close the Guardian trying to attack me with any submissions. You just tried to get back up and get away from me. That is a much harder round for me. Then if you actually come at me with your full board Jujitsu because then it's Hugh Jitsu versus you did too and I have an advantage. Yup. But if it's Jujitsu of mine versus run away from you, now I've got to run after you. Now it's, it's, it's a more fair fight. So that's what, that's what Mcgregor needs to do. He needs to use his speed and his, yeah, use his speed and that, I think that's his biggest advantage. The other thing that I, the other thing that I find about the Diaz brothers that I wished that I could, I could, I wish they, I wish they would not trained so much triathlon and train more explosiveness. I wish she was a little bit strong or both Nate and nick. I mean, those guys are awesome and they're, they're great fighters, but they've, they really train. They do. They do literally do triathlons and so you're not getting explosive muscles. Now it shows that they have great cardio, but I'd rather just, they were a little bit more explosive. That's, that's my personal opinion.

Speaker 5:          01:31:52       Yeah, I dig it. I have no advice. I think Nate Diaz is so well rounded in this. As far as this matchup goes.

Speaker 6:          01:32:01       I don't know.

Speaker 7:          01:32:03       Like, just like that first fight Amea. The first fight though, you watched the first round. It's not easy. It's not a pushover. It's going to be a tough fight, man. Yeah. That's in the end. That's not what I'm saying at all. I'm saying he's making sure as far, you know, you know how like you, you know, you, you attack the weaker points, right? Like let's say I'm a way better striker than one guy and his Jujitsu is way better than mine. I can stay on it, you know, it's obvious that's where I'm an attack. But in this case it's not like that. So I'm not, yeah. I Dunno man. The cell phone. Yeah. It's a tough fight for it. For Connor as tough favor for Nate to, I mean, there were some, yeah. Yeah. Even though the ending of the fight was very lopsided, right.

Speaker 7:          01:32:42       The, the, the first round, it was a little closer and I think Connor fought, he had magic thought that some of them even said it. A post fight press conference. He said, you know, he was the big man, right. And, and I, I hit him with everything or not. And most of those would stop a smaller man. Yup. They didn't stop him. And I think that's gotta be, that's gotta be hard. Yeah. I think that got to them psychologically. So if he's prepared for that psychologically this time, maybe he'll be able to stick with a game plan and not shoot. Yeah. On him, which was ridiculous. Yeah. And even the shoot, it wasn't just like, Hey, I'm going to decide to shoot. It was kind of like a ditch ditch effort. Yeah. Kind of kind of rock too. And now you, you shoot your rock and you have to contend with Nate Diaz Jujitsu. So it's like, it's not just, I got to continue with Nate Diaz did you too, which is bad enough, by the way, but you're rocked and it was like a desperation thing. Then you've got to deal with it. Then you get that. So it seemed like, oh, was so quick, but it was like, it was just a bunch of compounding factors and culminated in that, that joke didn't work out. Looking forward to watching that. Yeah. All right, great. Next question, Jocko. Like you, many leaders began as rebels,

Speaker 6:          01:33:53       chocolates. The Rep will tell you about his band one day.

Speaker 7:          01:33:58       How did you learn to see the game? Yeah, man. That Elgin told you about. Yeah, man.

Speaker 6:          01:34:03       And that you told me about too.

Speaker 7:          01:34:06       How did you learn to see the game and are rule followers at a disadvantage? Okay. So yeah, I was a rebellious youth and you know, when I got in the seal teams, I was kind of a rebel, a rebel as well. And as a matter of fact, if you think about it from a certain perspective, being in special operations, especially when I came in, being in special operations is almost a form of rebellion in its own right. Because you're saying, look, the regular stuff, we'll do the regular stuff. Right, right. We'll do the other stuff. Yeah. So that was my attitude. You know, I thought all the regular navy, Nah, I'm doing. Yes. You know? So that was my rebellion and, and, and like I've explained before, joining the military, I grew up in, in New England, not lot of, not a huge

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       military proponent up there. And so that was, it was almost rebellious thing. It, matter of fact, it was a rebellious thing for me to join the military in the first place. So these are the kinds of things that were rebellious and yes, we were, we were my buddies in the word rebel youth with some rebellious rock and roll bands back in the day. So when I got to the seal teams, we actually were, I kind of maintained that, you know, like we're going to be hardcore. We meet, maybe the word isn't rebel, but we were, we were like outsiders, you know, we were like going hard and the group of guys I was with when the guy was, I went through seal training with that, went to seal team one with me back in the day. Uh, you know, we, we, we were getting after it. We were pushing hard, we were, you know, being hardcore and I actually got told to stand down a few times for doing stuff that was a little bit too hardcore and it's a matter of fact.

Speaker 1:          01:36:01       So you get these evaluations in the, in the navy, when I first got in the navy, that is old evaluation system where you had 15 things you were getting evaluated on and everybody, it, it had been um, in inflation. So highest grade you could get as a 4.0. So there was an inflation of the grades at the time. And so everyone just put 4.0 for everything pretty much. And I actually, I have this, I actually saved this evaluation of me, but I got a three, eight, 3.8 in team building. And the guy that gave it to me said, uh, you know, you're just, you're just too hard on people that are unsat.

Speaker 1:          01:36:46       Which I actually, he was one of the guys that I was like, you know, hard on. Yeah, it was hard on him. So an UNSAT, I used to use that word all the time, sat, run, ceremony. So that was sort of, you know, we were, we were rebelling by being super hardcore, I guess you could say. But then even though I was rebellious, and again, that's a strong word. I don't know if that's the word we were, I don't know if that's the perfect word, but I did. I loved the seal teams. Right. So in, in, in working for some of the great guys that I worked for, I realize that if you want to impact the teams, which I want to do because I did love teams, then you got to try and get into some kind of leadership position. You know, these guys that I respected that I worked for us a day, wait, that guy controls of this platoon, I want to do that.

Speaker 1:          01:37:36       He's helping us, he's making as good. So kind of like that old quote that the best form of revenge is success. It's almost like the best form of rebellion is success. And so that's what I kind of went for it to a situation I was trying to, for a situation where I could move forward and kind of bring this, hey, I got this now. This is my platoon. Who'd, you know? So I guess that was a little bit of a, there's a little bit simplified but, but you know, I don't want to get, I don't want to make it sound like I was some kind of crazy revel in the seal teams. I wasn't, I was, I was into the seal teams, I was into doing the right thing and I wanted to do the, do my best in the seal teams. So I guess that's not really being rebellious at all.

Speaker 1:          01:38:22       But I did still have some of that rebel mindset. And one of the things I think is beneficial about having a rebel mindset is you questioned things, you question things you're not allowed to. I was never afraid to say no or I don't agree with that. I was never afraid to be contrarian or something. I was never afraid to hold the line and take criticism. So that goes even if, if you're in a group of rebels and you go against them, who's the rebel now? Well you are. So when guys would be going down a certain path, I wouldn't, I'd be okay holding the line against them because I was okay with being an outsider. I guess that's the word I've been looking for. Like an outsider, someone that's not quite just following and doing what everyone else is doing. I've always been okay with being an outsider.

Speaker 1:          01:39:09       So maybe it's not necessarily a rebel, but being an outsider and like, okay, those guys are doing it that way. No, I don't agree with that. And I'm okay being over here by myself marching to my own drum, for lack of a better word. But it's kind of like only if you need to be kind of thing. Right. What do you mean? Like if everyone's doing the right thing, you're going to go with that and you're going to go hard the way you do. But yeah, you're not just like this follow the fall, right in line. You know? And I never, I would say that's something. And so if we categorize that as being rebellious than yes, I kind of, I would more categorize it with being comfortable with being an outsider. Yeah. Comfortable with my own decision making process. So, and not always. I mean, there was times where I did things that other one, you know, when I was younger, you're not. That's another thing when, um, you know, you hear me talk, I'm 44 years old, right? I spent my whole adult life in the seal teams. I didn't show up in the seal teams with like this incredible leadership capability and ready to write a book. No, man, I learned this stuff. I'm learning, I'm still learning. I'm still learning this stuff. I picked up off along the way. So I don't want people to ever think that, you know, I was a superstar.

Speaker 1:          01:40:30       I'm still not, I'm just, I have an open mind, but now I can look back and I was lucky enough to have some great jobs and some great experiences that opened a lot of, uh, it showed me have to, I learned a lot. I, I, I had an open mind and the world taught me a lot of stuff. And so, uh, yeah, but it wasn't, it wasn't just, hey I

Speaker 7:          01:40:54       was showed up there. But I would say this, the lead people that are out there, data leaders keep the revel alive. Keep it alive, keep them under control. Yeah. And maybe you don't let the rebel talk to other people. Right. Maybe. And I've, I've had seal buddies that do this where they're, they're rebellious. There was outsider or whatever the word we're using as I am, but they just can't keep it inside. So they're verbalizing it and there. And what are they doing? They're making enemies. You know, they're making their, their antagonizing people. They're doing that. I never did that cause I'm playing the game. I'm going to win the long term strategic goal. So don't let the rebel be the one that represents you and talks and opened your mouth, but let them whisper in your ear and listen to,

Speaker 6:          01:41:47       yeah, I talked to him to get policy. I talked to my wife a lot about the difference. There's a difference between what you think or what you feel or whatever and what, how you behave. So like you can, like if you, I don't know, you get cut off

Speaker 7:          01:42:02       in traffic or something,

Speaker 6:          01:42:05       no one's going to be mad at you if you're like mad at that or if that irritates you or whatever. But if you start flipping the guy off or or, or violating traffic laws to go chase them or do you know to start behaving because he cut you behaving a certain way then that that's wrong. So there's a difference. You can feel like all kinds of stuff, but once you start misbehaving, that's when the violations come up. Basically what you're saying, like don't, don't let him control your drag. Drag. Yeah. Your behavior, mine control. Think we've talked about that on here before. A little by control body control too. Yeah. They're just being a rebel typically. That's like, Hey, all these rules that everyone's following, I'm going to, I rebel against those rules. But here's the thing. Some of those rules are good rules. Exactly.

Speaker 6:          01:42:49       So you can't just be a rebel to bone on bone Lincoln statement. I'm a rebel and that's why, that's why I was kind of pulling back on that word. Makes me sound like I was big rebel. I was not. I was, I loved being the teams. Right. So why would I rebel against it? The people I rebelled against where the guys that were not good seals, we were developed against them. Like I told you, we had a mute me that was a rebellion rebellion. Had a real legit mutiny when against our commanding are our platoon commander and said, hey to the commanding officer said, no, we don't want this guy anymore. That's, that's a wrap. Yeah. We rebelled. But then again, everyone, I'm a platoon was with me, so we all were about, so then it was I rebel. Yeah. And does that make you a rebel? Just cause you rebelled at one time,

Speaker 7:          01:43:36       you know? Yeah. I get it. Think we're getting into too much semantics. Aren't 108th semantics kind of part of let's not go there. All right, next question, Jacqueline. How do you deal with the leader who preaches ownership but does not practice ownership? Oh, drag. The leader who preaches ownership but does not practice ownership. You know what I do in those situations? I take ownership myself and I worked for all kinds of bosses that didn't want to take ownership and you know what? I did take ownership. I took ownership. You worked for a Boston doesn't want to lead. You know what I did? If for in my mind, if a boss doesn't step up or doesn't take ownership, they're not a problem. They're an opportunity. They are an opportunity. It's an opportunity for me to step. If you're not, if you're my leader and you're not giving me instruction, you're not stepping up and leading, guess what? I'm going to run with it. I'm going to run. I'm going to take control. I'm going to take command. I'm going to make things happen, and you're either going to, you're either going to see what I'm doing and say, wow, he's taking ownership. I need to step up. Or

Speaker 7:          01:44:56       if he doesn't have any potential at all, then maybe he looks at it and says,

Speaker 4:          01:45:02       mmm,

Speaker 7:          01:45:04       you know what? Maybe I'm not fit for this. Or maybe they don't realize it's happening. You'll end up taking their job from them because other people will eventually realize. Now the thing that you have to be careful of

Speaker 7:          01:45:16       is if you say, oh, he's not leading, I'm going to lead. Then you let your ego starts saying I'm the leader and then you flaunt it and now you might make your boss think that you're gunning for their job and then we can have some issues because now he might shut you down. He might, you know, there's all kinds of things like negative things that can happen there. So when you take ownership, you've got to make sure you're putting your ego in check and make sure that you're taking ownership, but you're still giving them the credit. That's the hardest thing to do, but it works. I'm telling you, I promise you that works if you take ownership, but then you'd give him the credit like, Hey sir, you know, I just wanted to go through this thing right here. Here's what I did yesterday based on, you know, the guidance that you gave us.

Speaker 7:          01:45:56       The guy didn't give you any guidance, but you just make it up. Biz, make it up. He's, you know, here we go and you just do your best to make him look good. Eventually you're going to win. So if you've got someone that's not leading, that's not stepping up, that's not taking ownership, just do it yourself. Do it in a tactful manner. Do it in a non ego flare up manner, but do it. Make it happen. Get after it. Yeah. If you keep that goal, you know how like when you're on a team, right? You have some objectives and it's probably, there's just a handful of them typically if not just one close with and destroy the enemy. Yup. Yeah. Make the sale, you know, whatever the goal is. If you keep the goal in mind, then you as long as you'd like, really keep it in mind you, you can avoid all these because if you're like, okay, I'm going to step out. Just like are you saying I'm going to step up and lead and if your

Speaker 6:          01:46:50       goal shifts from the, the main goal that you guys all have to now my new goal is to be the leader. That's my goal, to be the leader. Then up comes the ego because the being the leader, that's what you're focused on. I'm the leader. You're the follower kind of thing. Keep the goal in mind. You're going to do basically with your ownership. You're going to do your part and then some, if someone's not doing certain things or whatever, you're going to take the lead. You're going to do your job in it to achieve the goal.

Speaker 5:          01:47:18       Therefore, pulling everybody ahead. Keep that, keep that goal in mind there. Yes, indeed. They do it for the goal, not for yourself. Yeah. Good. Jocko,

Speaker 6:          01:47:32       something that would be very interested in listening to you discuss is the art of disarming people with words not hand. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:47:44       and good question. How do we, how do we disarm people and good thing. Tonight we talked about maneuver warfare because we already know that we're not going to attack the strong point. We're going to look for the gaps. We're going to look for the weaknesses. We're going to look for the openings. So what does that mean? That means if we're dealing with someone that has a big ego, we're going to sidestep that. We might even throw some compliments out there. I might be saying, Echo, you're so good at they do, and that's right here. I could use some help doing that and now we're getting around his ego. Now we can start getting into his head. If the person's over aggressive, maybe you just have to be a little bit more accepting of them. Maybe if they're nervous, you've got to just reassure him they're hostile.

Speaker 5:          01:48:25       Be just be open minded to what they're saying. So there's a lot of ways that disarm him, like some tactical things did. You could literally, like it says, disarm people with words, so what are words? Disarm people? I'll give you a couple. That's a good idea. Oh, okay. Or yeah, that actually makes good guy that, that's good sense right there. That makes sense. Right? And disarmed or, Oh yeah, I like that. Disarmed. Right? All three of those little easy phrase. That's a good idea. That makes sense. You know, I liked that. Those are all things that are going to disarm somebody a little bit. And once you disarm them, they're going to, they're going to open up, they're gonna open up a little bit. So, so like once you, you're going to be, once you get them disarmed by just opening your mind, giving them a little compliment tome that you like with winter coming with coming from, and then you start to probe and trying to figure out what's going on at eight instead of being direct, right? We want to use the indirect method here. So you know, ask questions. Say, Hey Echo, could you explain to me what, what the, what we're trying to get done here.

Speaker 5:          01:49:40       That's a lot different than what are you trying to do here? That's an attack almost. What the hell were you thinking? What the hell were you thinking? Hmm. Hey, could you

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       explain to me this? Cause I'm not sure I understood it. I didn't really see everything here. Or Hey, I'm having trouble understanding this. Can you, can you help me? Cause I'm not sure. I don't think I get this. So now when I say that to you, you, in order to explain something, you have to actually open up. You have to say, okay, I'll find, I'll tell you, well that as soon as you say that now you're opened up right now you open up and when you open yourself up, will you open yourself up verbally with an idea to explain an idea, then you're opening yourself up mentally too. Cause now we're having a discussion and that's what I'm trying to make happen. So it's pretty easy. I shouldn't say it's pretty easy if you think about it and you just think about those simple phrases that you can use to disarm people of, hey, it's good idea. I like where you're coming from. All the have that, that, that actually, that makes good sense. Or that is the way you disarm somebody. Very simple. Yeah. And there's little things you can do

Speaker 6:          01:50:44       even outside actually outside, straight up, outside of any specific like scenario where you know how some people are just more approachable than other people. And then some people just aren't. So what you can do, and what I've noticed is people that don't talk negatively about people and don't come in just talking negative in general, like I knew a guy or no, I still know him, but I don't see him anymore hardly. But every time he'd come in, the first thing out of his mouth was something like, I don't know, traffic was bad, it was something bad. You know, he's just complaining about life. And it was just a matter of what particular thing he chose to complain about. But it was always a complaint. Everything. And another thing he would do is, let's say someone would say something, oh, hey, did you see this or that, or whatever.

Speaker 6:          01:51:31       This is. This was real cool. He'd be like, yeah, but, and then say something bad and kind of dump on it, you know? Yeah, that's true. But you know, that kind of stuff. So don't do that. So that seems kind of easy, but you'd be surprised where don't be super negative. Don't be, don't be a negative person in general. So right off the bat, you'll be kind of one of those guys that's more approachable. But here's, here's the one that's harder. I mean it's simple, but it's kind of harder to do because I think it comes kind of natural and easy. We'll not easy is don't talk bad about people. And when people were talking bad about people like to you or around you or whatever, don't like jump in and kind of accommodate them. And I'm not saying reject them or even talk bad about them talking bad about you.

Speaker 6:          01:52:14       I don't, don't do that. Just don't be one of those people. Yeah, it's the, here's the thing, it's, I'm going above and beyond saying don't be, you know, certain people, that's all they do is gossip about people. Of course. That's a no brainer. I'm saying never do it. Try to never do it at, at any cost. Never do it if you can. Cause basically you're trying to establish a rep of being this positive, approachable person. That's what you're trying to do. So, even though people don't take specific mental like, Oh, you're talking bad about this person, you always talk bad about people, the fee, you feel it. So you ever, you ever been around somebody who tells, tells you secrets every time they see you, like, Hey, I'm not supposed to tell you this but this. And you're like, Dang, this guy's telling me you know, all this cool secrets. I like being around them. And that's typically why people told him, I'm never going to tell him any secrets. That's exactly right. So you know, this guy talking about about people or this guy's being negative or whatever, when it comes to you, why, why would I want to trust in this guy or talk to this guy about this, especially if we're going to do something together. You know,

Speaker 5:          01:53:17       we're kind of coming at it from the other perspective, not how would you disarm or someone, you're just coming at it from how to you be a person that does live, you need to be disarmed.

Speaker 6:          01:53:24       Yeah. Like just, yeah, exactly. So you're so, so just so,

Speaker 5:          01:53:29       oh I no, no, you're actually right. So you're saying if, if I know you as a guy that doesn't talk bad and doesn't tell secrets and dozens, but then I'm going to automatically be a little bit, you're going to start off, so you've developed a relationship with the person with that one. Really make that your goal.

Speaker 7:          01:53:49       Cool. Yeah. Good check. Jocko.

Speaker 6:          01:53:57       Have you worked with anyone who led from an emotional or unbalanced place, but learn to do

Speaker 7:          01:54:03       tach and what helped them?

Speaker 5:          01:54:08       Well, when I was putting these questions together, obviously here's one where you also have to use a little disarmed movement to get someone that's getting emotional about something. You've got to get him to calm down you so you don't reciprocate the emotion. Don't coach people when they're angry or emotional. That's not the time to say, hey, you know what you need to do right now is you need to calm down. It doesn't work out. You know that that does does work. Actually Lafe was telling that story on the last podcast where he was, he was losing his temper about something. And I just stood there and said, kind of smiled and said, I didn't, I didn't reciprocate the anger. I said, hey, take it easy. You know, don't worry about it. Let's just think about it. Can you make this happen? And he's like, yeah, I can.

Speaker 5:          01:54:52       Of course. I actually, I had a, uh, one of my, one of my senior enlisted advisors, actually my first deployment to Iraq. And, uh, and he and I were old school team one guys. And uh, well one of my, one of my favorite guys in the world actually, but he would sometimes get a little bit, move snow little bit, little bit. And he had this tactic that I picked up from him that I, that I understood the way he, the way he addressed conflict was, and I broke it down for them eventually was simplify, amplify, and repeat. That's what he would do. And it actually worked or worked a lot of time on most people. And so like first if I said, hey, uh, I'm going to need yet, I want to take a couple more guys on this operation. And if he didn't think I needed more guys for an operation, he'd say, well, why don't you just take everyone in the compound?

Speaker 5:          01:55:50       I'll tell you what, just take every person on the roster, we'll give you little back if that'll give you enough people. Then we'll take everyone. I'll, I'll, I'll start rounding everyone up right now. We'll take every single person that we have out there, and I'll even grab some army guys on the web. That was his way. And, and, and, and I'd be like, no man. I know. What I wouldn't do is I wouldn't get defensive. I wouldn't get fired up. And I would say, Hey, no, I'm not saying I need everybody. I'm just saying I want to take a three more guys. There's some spaces in the vehicles that'll give us a little more ability to contain the target in. We'd look at that. I'd say, look, take a look at the map we can. And so then he'd keep calm down. And in this guy's case, he actually wasn't like too emotional.

Speaker 5:          01:56:31       He was just super passionate. And when I actually broke down the simplify, amplify and intensify, oh no. It was simplify, amplify and repeat. That's what you do to simplify, amplify, and repeat. When and then when, whenever we would start getting into discussion and he would start doing it, we would start laughing because he realized that that's exactly what he was doing with simplify, amplify, repeat. That's, that's what the name you put on his little theology. Yeah. No. If you said, like I said, if I said, hey, I need a couple more guys who take, we'll just take everyone then if that's what you need, you need every single guy. He would simplify what you said. He would amplify it and make it more extreme. And he would just repeat it over and over again. And most people that he did it too, they would feel stupid because of what he did to him. You know, he'd say, well, no, I don't need, and I'm not even just feel stupid. And he'd say, so just ridiculous and, and he'd win.

Speaker 5:          01:57:26       But, uh, we had, uh, we, we would laugh about it, but, but like I said, he wasn't actually too emotional. Um, he was just fired up about stuff, which is a positive thing, but someone that is actually too emotional. So like I said, you gotta stay calm. You don't don't coach people when they're angry, you set a good example. And then when people come down later, you talk to them about like gay man, that wasn't cool and you got to get a spin it right. Cause you're trying to get, you're trying to, you don't want to like literally coach. Cause if I say Echo, I need to coach you on something, then you're defensive and all that. But if I say, hey man, I, oh man, I rely on you because of your expertise. And I think you're the only guy in the platoon that can actually make this happen. So if you're losing your temper, man, that doesn't, all of a sudden I can't count on you and I need you cause you don't make good. We, none of us make good decisions if we're all bent out of shape on something. So I got out of please can you just, can you help me by just, hey man, if you start, if you start getting angry about something, just realize it's gonna Affect your decision making and we can't

Speaker 6:          01:58:42       have that man. We need to come. We need to make the good assistance. People are counting on us and that's how I'm handling some of that gets emotional about stuff. Yeah. That what it simplify. Repeat one breath, amplify. And Republicans say, all girls do this, but some wives might be, like you said, the wives with the last name Charles. You know, ultimately I think if you're, if you're in a good relation, you don't really take it that seriously. But yeah. You say like, I dunno, you know, hey you, you were, you said something mean to me or whatever, and they'll be little then why'd you marry me? Then why don't, why don't you just take it to the, to that next level. If I amplify and repeat, yeah. Or, or, or hey, go to this one time, long time ago, we first got together. She was, uh, she said she wanted me to get orange juice. I went to the store, it's going to store wanting me to get orange juice for whatever reason. I forgot the orange juice. I didn't choose not to get the orange juice. I forgot. I just forgot.

Speaker 6:          01:59:45       You know, you come home, forget the orange juice. She said something along the lines of does anything I say have any importance to you at all? That's, that's what that is. All she needed to do is say it more than once. And you've got the repeat as well. Yeah. So I mean, I get stands to that question. No. Yeah. Most things are pretty important. I mean, maybe not the orange juice at that moment, you know, I forgot. Um, the, another tactic, like when you talk to people, like they're calm him down or whatever, like let's say something, they lose their temper all the time or something like that. And you have to dress like them losing their temper and be like, hey, you know how, how you used the word passionate, passionate. It is, is, it's basically like an excuse word for someone being like, you know, when people are just passionate, I'm passionate.

Speaker 6:          02:00:31       You can be, it can be a euphemism. Well, here's the thing, being passionate and being emotional is are two different things because you can be passionate about something and not lose your temper. Not being in whether they're two different things. So people will be like, they'll put that on and so it sounds kind of acceptable. It's simply not true. But so if, if the, but you can use that to your advantage. You can be like, Hey, I know you're passionate. I dig it, man. It's one of the things I like about you. And another thing that I like about you is that you're also a thinker. That's why boom. And you say what to do. That's what you do. The Ninja mind there is, that's what I like about you or what I like about you is this, and then they kind of take on that role for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Very good. Very good. Next question, Dakota. What do you think of the saying you get more bees with honey? They actually asked Leif this too, but he's not here. You get more bees with honey. I was, I was actually heard you catch more flies

Speaker 5:          02:01:40       with honey than with vinegar, but the same idea. And it, it's something I I agree with. I mean obviously this is, comes down to the r word relationships. And always what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to build the relationships. So I'm going to put out the honey, you know, I'm going to put up the hunting. The carrot is, is preferable to the stick, which is another way of saying it. The reward, the good stuff, the isn't so, so yeah, totally that, that absolutely works better. Um, now you can give people too much honey and now they get type two diabetes. They get lazy, they get out of shape and they don't work anymore. Right? So you can't, you got to do, that's, that's the, that's the dichotomy that you need to balance as leader. Not being too hard, but not being too soft, not being too aggressive, but being aggressive enough.

Speaker 5:          02:02:37       That's the dichotomy. But the, the bottom line is you need to treat people well. That's what you need to do. You need to not spoil them, but give them respect. And build the relationships. And if you make that your goal, when I work with all these different companies, you know I'm, I'm, I want to say listen, make your goal with this person that you're having a problem with. Make your goal to build a relationship that make that your goal. When they say something negative, say something positive. When they want to blame something on you say, yeah, you're right, it's my fault. Build a relationship with the person that's going to strengthen the team is going to be thousand times infinitely better than having an antagonistic relationship with somebody. Yup. So I agree with it. And also, you know when you're leading with vinegar, when you're leading with fear and you're leading your, you're beating people with a stick that does not work out good in the long run. Do you have to have consequences sometimes. Yeah. But the team that is following somebody cause they want to do their best for that leader is going to beat the team that is doing things only because they're scared of the road. Right?

Speaker 6:          02:03:52       Yeah. They, if they're trying to avoid the stick that's going to be where they operate in you, they're going to operate enough to avoid the stigs act. Cause really that's the goal. To avoid the stick. There's no honey. You're not going to go above and beyond. Yeah. I think you said something very wise in a office space. What does he say? And he said he was in his little review, he got hypnotized. Did you watch office space? I've watched it a million times, so he gets hypnotized. Alright. So now he tells me the truth or he doesn't care, you know about things. So he's like, he's real open and honest. He goes into his little review, which is supposed to be this kind of tense thing. And they say, I'm like, what's up? You know, some thought on, they asked him some stuff and he's like, it's a cool, it's a problem of motivation. Like, you know, we're now if I get, you know, all the scenes. So he's explained it to him and then he's like, okay, if I'm, if I'm scared of, you know, whatever, this punishment

Speaker 7:          02:04:38       from my boss or whatever. No, I'm just going to work hard enough not to get fired. But that's true. That's absolutely true. So yeah, like these kids who only get scolded, you know, they don't get like compassionate and compliment in support and you know, that only get scolded a lot of times. I mean there's a lot more to it, but a lot of times they're just going to do the minimum and clearly you're not get scolded too far. The other direction where you get spoiled, spoiled. Yup. You're too far in the other. Yep. And the dangerous part about getting, giving to like going too far in the other direction, how you put it is you don't prepare them like they, they wind up when they're on their own. Like they're not prepared for the tough part. Yeah. The, the, yeah. And there's a lot of good parts in life, man. But those tough parts, they're there too. So if you're not prepared from, you're going to get jacked, for lack of a better term. That's the correct term. Actually, that last question, juggle great topic for me would be staying committed to life change. I start strong and fade fast into old habits. Please help. I'm going to,

Speaker 3:          02:05:48       yeah,

Speaker 7:          02:05:49       I'm going to have to bring in the little Shakespeare on this one. Shakespeare between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion, all the interim is like a fantasma or a hideous dream and that's Brutus from Julius Caesar and Brutus in the play is plotting to kill Caesar. Someone he was loyal to. In Shakespeare, the Master of understanding human nature captures what that feels like. And here's what these lines mean between the acting of a dreadful thing. So that's the moment, that moment when you're waiting to do something that you don't want to do and the first motion. So that's when you actually start doing that thing that you don't want to do all the interim. Now this is all that time, all that time in that moment while you are waiting to take action.

Speaker 3:          02:07:12       Okay.

Speaker 7:          02:07:13       Is like a fantasma or a hideous dream.

Speaker 3:          02:07:19       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:07:20       So that moment, that moment when you're waiting to do something, it's like an apparition, a hideous dream, a nightmare. Cancel the battle, the struggle it takes place in that moment. It's not knowing what to do. That's not the battle. It's not actually doing it. That's not the battle. It's the moment in between. It's the hesitation. Hesitation is the enemy and in war, understanding where the enemy is allows you to defeat him and this is where the enemy of action, the enemy of commitment, the enemy of change, that's where the enemy lies. It lies in the waiting in. All you have to do to win is overcome that moment. The waiting, the hesitation.

Speaker 3:          02:08:39       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:08:40       All you have to do is go, move, take action, get out of bed, get your feet on the ground, step into the gym, put down the doughnut, pick up the kettle bell. Do not hesitate. Do not wait, go forward, go to war and when every single time,

Speaker 7:          02:09:20       and I think that's all I've got for tonight. Thanks to everybody out there for listening and for all the awesome continued support or get getting from everybody if you want to keep supporting echo. How'd they do that? Well, primarily I would say support yourself with supplementation because really that's really what it's about. Not necessarily the supplementation but supporting yourself as well. It was kind of like when you, when you, um, when you fly in the airplane, yeah. You know, you've got to put the mask over your self first before you do you help your infant. Yeah. Yeah. Cause if you're not dope, like he, you know, you, you know what I mean? So anyway, if you need supplements, go to [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko get 10% off on it. Supplements. What does that mean? That's the best supplements. I like it. And you got 10% off.

Speaker 7:          02:10:18       Um, I could explain why they're so good, but you can go on the website, read it. Just trust me. It's the only supplements I take in you too, right? Yes, indeed. Where you take something else, cleans, don't vitamin, something like that. Or you can support by clicking through before you do Amazon shopping. Click through the website or just get the trooper to, I think that'd be a lot easier. So you go to the website, get the troop tool called Jocko podcast, trooper tool, chrome extension. Click on it. Boom. Confirm. Boom. It's on there. Anytime you shop at Amazon, you support passively this podcast and you're kind of official. That's dope. I don't like the word passive even though I know it's the correct term because when you are shop, that's a, that's a really good, easy way to support the podcast. So I don't agree with you on the passage. I like passive and they're actively shopping, actively getting after it passively supporting.

Speaker 7:          02:11:16       They actively went to the website, they actively installed the tool or they click through, they're taking action and they're making things happen. Yup. And if the credit and it's efficient to give him credit and official anyway, nonetheless, that's a way. And um, that's a good way. A subscribe on iTunes. Of course, if you haven't already write a review. Yeah. To write a review. Somebody wrote an awesome review the other day that's appreciate it. Cause then we know what we're doing here. We're getting a feedback. I'm reading the reviews. Yeah. And it goes reading the reviews. Subscribe to Youtube and we're going to be more, little bit more active on the youtube. So it won't be just ideal version. I'm going to get act. I'm going to do it. Why don't you get a lot more? Actually, I'm doing it. I'm active. I'm more active. That's good. That's it right now.

Speaker 7:          02:12:04       So that's again, subscribe to Youtube now. Lens, how about this? Subscribe to Youtube. If I'm putting out dumb stuff, if a mucking it up. But right now it's just, you know, the video version of the podcast, which is cool. If you'd like podcasts, why not like to be doing version? If you even like videos, I'm going to add some stuff in there, some whatever. Some I'll take the deleted scenes, other stuff, little mash ups or whatever. If they're lame, just unsubscribe. You're confident that they will not be there. I'm confident yet, but I actually thought the first one was uh, it was pretty dark. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you know what's funny about those things? It's a big inside joke for somebody that's like no one is that doesn't, if someone stumbles across that video and watches it, you're going to mean nothing to yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:13:02       To get, they'll get anybody that is in the game with us. Yeah, they're there. They know what's funny. Yeah. They call those Easter, like those little Easter eggs in there. Like you know the trooper tool video. There's little Easter eggs in there, you know, if you play it back and pay attention to whatever. Yeah, I like that. Just like the shirts as cautionary tales. Sharp man. Everybody saw that on your Amazon page that you displayed? Yeah, the duck tape. Actually if you look closer it's like, well yeah, this, this stuff is, he strikes in everything. You just want to give them away. That's part of the fun part of it nonetheless. Yeah, sure. Youtube, you can support that way. And of course if you like the shirts, get a shirt, got a kind of a new one that the trooper one. It just, it's just the basic brand in Jocko podcast. If you're on youtube right now, I'm wearing one right now.

Speaker 7:          02:13:54       Debbie one over the, one of the troopers. She took a picture of the day like wow. Just amazing background. Mountains, Snow Cap, mountains, trees, trooper trooper Tisher. Outstanding. That was good. Yeah. Well they are good. I didn't make it a point to get the good ones. They're not like, you know, you know, the process of creating quality quality yet I didn't just be like, hey, give me the cheapest possible one. The ballpark giveaway. I didn't do that. I was to get the, you know, I went through some lengths. So they're so they're good. Wearable. My goal is to be like, if you put it on you'd be like, this is my, regardless of what's on it, this is my favorite shirt. That's the goal. And so the design is just a bonus. I like to think so. Yeah, that's, that's a great bonus. But yeah, you get a shirt Jocko, store.com boom, get us, you get a sticker too if you want.

Speaker 7:          02:14:54       There's a few options there and a coffee mug and may or may not have some Jocko White Tea, pomegranate. Maybe we haven't got a little something coming out. You're working with the, working with a company. A lot of people would talk to me about the beverage that I drink. Yeah. I drink some Alpha brain, but my most common beverage is the Palmer. Yup. And that didn't find that out on Tim Ferriss. Right. He first people went crazy. Yeah. Cause he was asking, Hey, what does that, what does that, what does he drink? Kind of seeing him when he drank it, he got all fired up. Listen to them, listen to Tim Ferriss podcast. He's at, this is like an adrenaline fueled. There's caffeine in though. And yeah, there's, there's a small amount of caffeine, well I shouldn't say small, usually. Usually white tees about a third of a cup of coffee. So it's pretty mild on the caffeine and he's like a micro dose of caffeine, just may antioxidants in there and it tastes good.

Speaker 7:          02:15:55       And so anyways, it got approached about, hey, we are, we're fans of the Jocko podcast and guess what? We make tea, boom, we want to make your tea. So I went through some iterations trying to find it and tune it, the little, the mixture. And now we got to listen. Talk away to the Brown's. It's going to be good. Yeah. Uh, so what, we'll put it on the Jocko store, some kind of connection to get it, you know what Matt and I don't know when that'll be out there sometime soon. Yeah. And you put that thing on there where people can have get emails from us. Yeah. Oh yes. I the the mailing list, right. Put simply as a mailing list. It's the, it's more for like, like insiders if you care about like, I dunno, insight or stuff. So I don't, you know how like there's a lot of mailing lists or whatever you can get on and they'll like send you a mass email every, make it a point not to say new stuff that's like not relevant because you sometimes know sign up for that before.

Speaker 7:          02:16:59       Yeah. No, don't fill people's email box with stuff that is just stuff. It's like, it's like, hey, here's my email. Violate my trust. No Man, no, I'll send you me. Yeah, I'll, I'll, when I, if there's something comes up. Yeah. And not the kind of like, Hey, one out of all these people, one of these people might be interested in this. Let me send it to everybody. It's not that kind. No. If I think everyone's gonna be interested, I could be wrong. But if I think that genuinely, and I'll send you some tanned. Furthermore, if there is a pandemic epic, a disaster situation, I will be sending forth instructions for all the troopers to congregate and dominate. And that's what we're going to do. Katie event as a Zombie apocalypse. See that alone right there. Is there either and at some point do you know at some point I may send out like a longer thing like for instance upcoming right?

Speaker 7:          02:17:59       We got the monster right? Lafe and I are doing here in San Diego. Got To get out some details on that so people know when it's going down, all that stuff. I'm gonna send that out through there so that people know what's happening. They get connected. So that's, that's an example. Yeah. Am I going to email it 47 times? No. Hey reminder. But I know if you're enlisted on the, on the mail, then you're interested in what we're saying. Yeah. So I think this is what we're putting it out there. We are. We're not going to violate that. Here's my email. Violate my trust. You know how they'll, cause they'll send you stuff every like three days. Oh yeah. If you let them sometimes multiple times a day. Oh, who does that? Why would you, why is that? I'm not going to name the marketing on it.

Speaker 7:          02:18:47       No. Is that considered to be good marketing? Somebody wants to be telling people to do that. I don't know. You know what? That's, that's, that's what I don't want to do these market things. Yeah. See that's the thing. If anybody out there thinks a marketing things, stop me. Do it. Well I did recently. There's a difference between advertising and marketing. So marketing is everything. Like if, if even you wearing that shirt, that's technical marketing for Victor Advertising. Okay, well on the other hand busted. I don't want to get into a big thing here bro. I was talking to him then we market and we advertise for no, we mark it. We don't ever advertise. We don't know. Okay. And what about when I say, what about when you say hey on it has good stuff. And I say, yeah, get the Krill oil that's on it.

Speaker 7:          02:19:39       Advertising technically. Okay, I'm, I'm, we're in the advertising. Well, what I don't want to do is beat people down with, you know, buy this, buy that. I don't want to do that on it is actually supporting the podcast and I support on it. That's Joe Rogan's company and Joe Rogan is a great guy who helped us out, who walked by the way, we're sitting here because of Joe Rogan, Fyi. All right, the other way, I also, you got the, um, you can buy a little book called extreme ownership written by myself and my brother Leif Babin who was on the last podcast podcast 34, he was also on podcast 11 and we wrote a book. It's about leadership, it's about war, it's about business, it's about life. And it's available in hardcover and digital audio format. Both Lafe and I reread the sections that we wrote. So that's cool.

Speaker 7:          02:20:32       And you know, what's cool is get it for yourself, which is cool. It'll help you. But then he'll per team grabbed him a copy and you're helping us, you know a little bit. Yeah, it's for support. Go think good about that book. I said this before, but it's worth saying again is that, you know how like some books it's like, okay, I'm going to improve in in whatever. I'm going to read this book. It's just helped me in this way or that way or whatever. But this is like the kind of stuff where you can literally turn on that. Like right when you read a certain sentence and it's giving you whatever, you know, whatever this advice is, whichever one it is, but extreme ownership, we'll say you can turn it on right then in there, like right then and there you can walk with you and you have to read the whole book technically and it'll, you'll already be changed.

Speaker 7:          02:21:16       That's awesome. You just got to do it. I'm saying like not all books are like that. It's like, oh yeah, it's this gradual process that is awesome. But anyway, that's, that's a big takeaway I got from it. Now as always, if you want to let us know what's going on in your world, you want to continue this little talk that we're having amongst us. We're all up in the inner webs, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Echo is at Echo, Charles and I am at jockowillink. Now, one of the things that I've made a note here to talk about little bit. Got To, got to come clean here, got to address something. Uh, went on a little trip into the bush, was out of contact before I left on the trip.

Speaker 4:          02:22:05       Aye

Speaker 7:          02:22:07       Stopped. I didn't stop, but I could no longer keep up, could no longer keep up with responding. There was a time they're all up until a week ago, maybe, maybe a week and a half ago. I committed and responded to every single

Speaker 5:          02:22:26       person that hit me on Twitter a hundred percent. And I kept trying to maintain and I told everyone I'm gonna maintain and I'd, and I maintained for a long time for what, six months, seven months, something like that. But I, I cannot maintain anymore. I cannot respond to every single person. Um, and especially coming back from being in the field for, you know, seven days where I didn't have it or have it very sparingly. I'm getting thousands of tweets a day, which is awesome. And you know what? I do read them all. I absolutely read them all, but to respond to every single one of them, I don't, I don't have time. Starting about a week and a half ago, I just said, Nah, I can't do this. Because first of all we went to the whole thing of like, oh, we're going to go two times a week for the podcast. The one time, two times a month for the podcast, maybe one every two weeks.

Speaker 5:          02:23:23       Most people didn't like that. I didn't like that. I want to come in here and get it on. So, but well and, and I used to be able to respond to the Twitter in like 45 minutes a day, which I find that time I'll make that time. Then it was an hour, then it was an hour and 10 minutes and all of a sudden it became two hours a day. And then if think about this, if I missed a day for whatever reason or missed a day and a half, five hours. Finally one Sunday I sat down and I did Twitter for a stupid amount of time, you know, six something hours and Twitter's a great method of communication, but I got to

Speaker 7:          02:24:04       be more selective and disciplined about my time management. I don't want to carry this on even further, but the reason I'm kind of like kind of laughing is that, cause you're kind of new to social media kind of. But it's funny cause like you're saying, this is going to sound strange, but you're that nice of a person that you're like telling everyone like we know, we know you can respond to, but you're like really bothered by it. You're like, God I can't, I'm not a prude. I being rude. That's what's fun. I feel bad. It's funny because from your perspective it's like, it's like someone's talking to you for real and you're just like basically putting your finger up saying I don't, you know, I don't have time for you, you know, but anything in your arm, we are kind of a group, a team, which makes it even more, which I'm sort of like the guy that facilitates the communication between us from an almost a leadership position. And so for now, and you know, it was funny because uh, one of, one of the troopers guy named Brandon who's been in the game since day one, I forget how he found, I think, I think he listened to Tim Ferriss bark and he immediately like followed me on Twitter and we were going back and forth on a bunch of stuff and, and finally we were emailing about some stuff we were emailing about. Uh, he, he was trying

Speaker 5:          02:25:24       to get Timex to sponsor the podcast or me or something. Cause Timex is selling watches factually, factually the, a lot of people have bought Timex ironman watches, watches from your thing, just from phone, from wanting to get in the game. You know, like, oh yeah, that's cool man, let's do it. It's good. You know. And so a lot of people have factually bought those watches. And so Brandon trooper was like, Hey, you know what, I'm going to contact these guys. So we went back on a bunch of emails. I have pictures of me with this watch on with his Timex watch it you see on my Twitter feed, not the exact same watch but the same model, watch the same model. And I have I think five of them right now. And actually some troopers sent me other older, cause you can't buy them anymore.

Speaker 5:          02:26:16       So I have, I have enough of these watches to last me for the rest of my life. You know, I think it's about five or six and, and I've actually done surgery on these watches over the years. Like yeah, like one would break a certain part. So I'd taken other one apart and I put the insides and you know, so one day I was reading an email from Brandon cause we emailed back and forth on this a couple of times. And then the other day he emailed me, just said, hey, just so you know, I haven't given up, I'm still on time accident. I sent him an email and I was reading it on the way here to record. And uh, and I was, I was looking through the email when I parked, I suppose his phone number at the bottom and I just hit, you know, it's the iPhone.

Speaker 5:          02:26:57       I hit it, I hit the thing and it called. And uh, and I said, and he's like, hey, this is Brandon. And I said, hey, what's up man? It's Jocko. And he's like, really? I go, yeah man, what's going on? I just wanted to touch base. And he's, uh, and, and so I said, so we started talking and this was right as the social media, I was reaching the kind of the end of the line of social media. And as I'm sort of thinking about how I'm going to manage and how I'm going to, like, if I could tell people like, listen, I'm sorry, I just can't, I can't, I physically can't do it. And one of the things he says to me while we're talking, he goes, you know what's so awesome is that you respond to everybody. And I was like, so I s I stuck with it.

Speaker 5:          02:27:41       I said, okay, you know what? I'm behind him. And he sit down. And I think that's when I did like a Sunday where I just sat there like an idiot. I know, but it just boom, boom, boom, boom and fingers to zoom. A lot of people are telling me good stuff and I'm not going to say, hey man, thanks. That's a good point. Oh, that's a good book. I'm gonna check that out. So when he told me that, I said, okay, to hold the line, I got to hold the line and then, and then I realized if I'm gonna hold the line on that I'm going to let go of more important things. One of them being the podcast, one of them be in the podcast and not putting forth quality podcasts, which to me is the most important thing that, that I'm doing right now is, is getting the podcast quality from a podcast perspective. Right. Um, so yeah, there's my, there's my social media adventure.

Speaker 6:          02:28:24       No. Yeah.
