Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 59 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening.

Speaker 2:          00:00:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:16       Their screams are the worst. We're more than a hundred meters away on the other side of the river, but I can hear marines dying. Their armored vehicle hit a landmine.

Speaker 2:          00:00:32       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:00:33       it caught fire with 15 men aboard.

Speaker 2:          00:00:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:39       They scream as they burn alive. The radio chatter is desperate. Almost a sterically.

Speaker 2:          00:00:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       Nobody can get to them. There will be no salvation, only a torturous death in the flames from our position across the river, we hear every agonizing moment and can see their funeral pyre rising over the river bank. I can do nothing.

Speaker 2:          00:01:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:25       It is the most helpless enraging feeling I've ever experienced. I have no way to get across the water to those burning men.

Speaker 2:          00:01:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:40       It takes forever for the last screams to fade away.

Speaker 2:          00:01:49       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:55       And that is an excerpt from a book called Heart for the fight.

Speaker 2:          00:02:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:03       And it's written by a guy named Brian Stan, and if you don't know who Brian Stann is, you can Google him.

Speaker 2:          00:02:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:15       He's a son, a father or husband. He was the WEC light heavyweight champion of the world. He's a UFC veteran.

Speaker 2:          00:02:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:26       11 fights in the UFC with some wins and some losses against some of the best fighters in the world. He's also a veteran of the United States Marine Corps with two tours to Iraq as a platoon commander and as a company XL. And I am honored tonight to actually have Brian with us here as a guest.

Speaker 2:          00:03:02       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:03:03       Mr Brian Stann welcome to the show. I got to tell you, that's a, I have not been introduced like that before at an exit of that book that I could honestly say I haven't laid eyes on, I don't even know how many years. I forget the year we released it. Some powerful writing by, uh, my ghost writer Jon Bruning. And that is a tough, tough memory. It's one of those ones that we kind of buried deep down and think about just from time to time. But, uh, certainly when you, when you, at times where maybe you take things for granted in life, it's good to go back to that moment. You know, and realize that a, whenever I may be whining about or whatever I think is difficult at the time is a heck of a lot easier than it once was. And I need to be grateful, get off my butt and go finish. Yeah. I think that

Speaker 1:          00:03:53       a lot of people, you know, you get, you see the explosions take place with ideas and you know, the wars that we were involved in were, you know, the, the main weapon of the enemy was the IED. And even when we made thicker, heavier armored vehicles or like track vehicles when they get hit with an IED, even though it might withstand some of the impact, there's fires start and it's, it's a nightmare. And this is the nightmare you describe right there. And

Speaker 2:          00:04:19       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:20       You know, I want to get into that. I want to get into the combat that you experienced. But before we do that, first of all, like the people that listen to this show, not everyone even watches UFC, not everyone knows about you. So just kind of give a little bit of a background

Speaker 3:          00:04:38       on grown up. Let's take it back to Scranton. Chevy. Yeah, absolutely. Uh, so moved around a lot. I was actually sells born in Japan and uh, around that time when, when my mom had come back to the states, my father had left and so grew up in northeast Pennsylvania. We moved around quite a bit, uh, but got into sports in the early age. And I had a phenomenal mom and, and I think not having a dad really affected my sister a lot more than it affected me. Um, but even from an early age, I, I knew that the military was going to be an option from the days of being a young kid watching silly movies like Iron Eagle, you know, they were, they were something, they were not called Iron Eagle. Silly in front of that. That's not your classic. Yep. But, but for me there, there was always something to it that, that rang is special to me.

Speaker 3:          00:05:37       And you know, what I found is growing up without a dad, you tend to want to impress every male influence you have in your life. So every time I went out for a team, I wanted to be the hardest worker on the team. I'd run through a wall for my coach and, and, and that continued all the way through high school. And then all of a sudden playing high school football, I started to get recruited by some good schools and not many people in my family had gone to college. Certainly I had expected to go to college but never expected to get recruited to go play somewhere. And so that was a different experience for me. I didn't always handle it the best. Um, but when the naval academy came knocking, you know, I knew that's what I wanted to go. West Point started recruiting me early as a junior, I took my films, my tapes to the Naval Academy.

Speaker 3:          00:06:24       There was just something about that place and I wanted to go there. So I decided before I make a decision, let me visit West Point, let me visit the Naval Academy and a four day time period, I'll visit both and make my decision. When I went to West Point, one of the football coaches was supposed to meet me there never showed. So one of the players took me around campus, showed me some stuff, but it was still beautiful. I mean greater than any, you know, Scranton's one of the poorest cities in America. It's not nice. So you know, my uncles, my aunts and my mom, the thought of me going to the naval came as a big deal. I remember my track coach in high school telling me, Brian, listen, this is a big deal. It's a great opportunity. There's a lot of things in your life that can change by going here.

Speaker 3:          00:07:04       I said, yeah, but you know, I'm getting recruited by some of these Ivy League schools to, he says, Eh, it's not the same and I don't think you're going to fit in. I honest, I'm going to be honest with you, Brian, my track coach, so bright guy. So two days later I go to the naval academy and a hand them my tape. Now. They hadn't even started recruiting me yet, but those coaches were so nice to my mom. And by doing that, it was mom, they recruited my mom. They were so respectful to her. The water was there. It was so pretty. Okay. You know, I'm, I'm in. And I had made that decision early that that's where I wanted to go and, and focused on and that, you know, did some summer school to take some classes to boost my AP courses in high school just to make sure they don't have to go to the prep school first.

Speaker 3:          00:07:44       I want to go right to the naval academy. And so that, that in, in a really quick nutshell, football was a vehicle. Um, along with my academics were good, but you know, having a three, five GPA and a 12, 10, and your sats isn't normally going to get you into the naval academy. Football was, was the vehicle that got me there. And I could remember prom night lifting weights in the weight room with my rented Tux in the locker. I was there all by myself. I had the security code, I was, I, you know, one of the only guys who worked all summer long. I was the only white guy where I worked in this tomato plant and I would work to help pay for the high school I went to. Cause my mom, my mom took me out of public schooling, put me in this good high school because I got suspended a couple of times in middle school and it was one of the harder decisions but one of the best decisions that she made and pushed me towards, cause the teachers at that school when they saw me having this opportunity, they helped, hey, let's help Brian get to the Naval Academy, go there to play football.

Speaker 3:          00:08:38       But you know, really get himself on a great trajectory. And uh, there, there's not a day I regret it. There were definitely days I couldn't stand being at the Naval Academy like anybody hated it. But the friends I made there, the opportunities and the pathway to the Marine Corps, still to this day, I don't know if I'll ever be as good at any job because I wasn't being a marine infantry officer. I just, I don't know that. And we, when you got there you're, they, the type of football that they were playing didn't really match your cause you were a quarterback and I was right. And so in the book you're saying that your, your type of football didn't really match what they wanted to do? No, it was a rude awakening for me. You know, I went there thinking, Hey, I'm going to be the next Roger Staubach and we all did and then all of a sudden you start to see all these other kids from all over the country.

Speaker 3:          00:09:28       Wow. They're good too. I'd never really run the option before. And they've got guys from the prep school that already done a year in the system and did that system in high school that can run the option. So next thing you know, I'm getting moved to wider Seaver and get moved to safety. Then I'm getting moved, a linebacker and I have to figure out how to play these positions. And it was one of the best lessons I ever learned as a young man where I had to make a decision, I'm going to contribute to this team. I'm not going to be a starter, I'm not going to be a star. Some of the best contributions I can make as a leader are to help mentally prepare the younger guys to play. So my senior year, I was competing for the starting outside linebacker position and we had this young kid named Bobby Mclaren who was an animal, I mean an animal, but he was uncontrollable.

Speaker 3:          00:10:12       He could not understand the defense at all. He's still wild man, flying around, knocking over anything he touched, but he was an idiot if football was an engineering major, really bright kid, but a more on in football. All right, so I'm a senior, I'm going to help this kid out and we're in two and I'm competing for the starting job and I'm helping this kid out who's third string and he's getting frustrated and then all of a sudden he starts to get it and he's starting to grasp on. And slowly but surely I could see this kid taken not only my job but the job of the guy who was ahead of me, who I was competing with. And you know, the bottom line was is I had to find a way to contribute value to the team, obviously has a special teams contributor, but leadership was going to be the biggest thing I contributed and, and that made me a very valuable member of the team that season.

Speaker 3:          00:10:58       And it taught me great lessons moving forward both in the marine corps and especially now in my job. If you aren't finding a way to add value to your organization, to your team every day and you're wasting time, you're wasting money and somebody's going to take that spot, somebody will come along and take that spot. I don't care how successful you get, you can't take life for granted everyday. You got to add value. I learned that lesson early in my football coach. My linebacker coach liked me the most. I was his favorite guy and he would admit that to me in our personal meetings. But the end of the day he told me, Brian, I get paid. I feed my family to put the best players on the field who are gonna help us win games. I really wished that was you right now. But it's not. And those are hard conversations to listen to. But if you're going to be a leader, you gotta be able to receive that information and find a way to get better. Yeah. You know, speaking of that, so

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       you, you actually, they fired the coach that you had your first three years. New Coach came in and I'm going to go to the book here. It's your senior year. Two a days are brutal or deals detested by every player who has stepped foot on a, on a football field. That summer, our new coach, Paul Johnson used to a days to make a statement. He made us proud and start practicing before dawn. Every day at zero four 45 we reported to the field and Johnson's new coaching staff beat us half to death with repeated fourth quarter drills we ran. We hit none of this. No contact drilling. Johnson spared no one by mid morning. Guys were puking where they stood. I love this right here. No wonder why you pussies went oh and 11 he shouted more than once as we gasped and suffered. Coach Johnson showed no mercy when he evaluated the team, he concluded that we lacked discipline and motivation. He made our two weeks in August, a crucible designed to test our toughness and our commitment to the team. At one point, a wide receiver went down with a phantom injury. After the team doctor examined the whiteout and found nothing wrong with him. Coach Johnson demoted him on this bought.

Speaker 3:          00:13:06       So coach Johnson came in and dropped the he have it. I still remember, you know, back then at the naval can, we had what was called instant messenger. And so you could leave in a way message, you know, and your instant messenger. And we did our fourth quarter drilled. I remember our starting defensive end, Pete Butte Miller, he left in his away message. He said, today I met death and death kicked my, you know what? It was brutal and they scream that at us repeatedly. No wonder you went, Oh and 11 we were in Naval Academy football team and the previous coach had let discipline just run awry. You know, both on the field in practice, in the weight room, in films you could be hurt all week, still start in the game. The things that are essential for a military academy team to win. I mean you, you've gotta be in better shape than the other team and you've got to commit less mental errors because physically you're never really going to match up.

Speaker 3:          00:13:57       Right? And we were making that error and from all that chaos, one of the, the real amazing things I learned from those coaches who that staff is basically still there today. Coach Niumatalolo was the offensive coordinator when Johnson left. He's now the head coach, but they taught me as, as leaders to expect excellent. Every single drill, every film session, every weight room session, every conditioning there was a standard. You either meet the standard or you don't meet the standard. And if you don't meet the standard, there are consequences. There's remediation. There's ways that you have to fix it because this is the only thing that's good enough. If we're going to move forward, you either get better, you get worse every day. Getting worse is unacceptable. And when, when you take that mentality as an officer to what you're doing in the field to train 160 marines to go to combat, all of a sudden that gets a lot more serious than win and lose and football games.

Speaker 3:          00:14:54       But that, that, that holds true in business. It holds true in anything. There is a standard. And if you, if you accept below that standard, just once, that sets a precedent that could lead to what happened before he got there. And, and I've, I've gone back to the Naval Academy repeatedly and I've talked to the team. I actually talked to the junior class every single year. And one of the things I always tell those coaches, uh, gentlemen, you guys are putting out a better product as officers because you're here. Your job is to put forth the great football team. But I promise you and the staff at the Naval Academy, the officers, they see it too. They are making better leaders because of what they're doing on the football field before they got there, that wasn't happening. What was happening on the football field is making, making us worse officers. And so I, I still hold true, he now coaches John Paul Johnson, coaches at Georgia tech now, he brought me down to speak to the team a couple of years ago and we had some great conversations, but I mean he's still, he's still that same guy still thinks he can beat me up. Coach, I get it. And I'm not asking you in front of your teammates, you always say, you can walk me. You have to realize now there's not a chance, but he is not. Boy, I'm telling you, I still think I won't be and he'll throw this off. You know right across. It's geriatric at this point. He could barely even get his arm up, but he's still throws it like he can beat me. He's game, he's gay, he's gained, he's game. The heart's there. The body though.

Speaker 1:          00:16:18       So you actually, you actually talk about this in the book. So here we go. All that effort, pain and misery made me a more disciplined human being. It prepared me for the trials ahead. As a Marine infantry officer. In fact, many of the lessons I learned helped me better prepare my platoon and later my company for combat in Iraq, in football and in a rifle company, there is no substitute for discipline, hard work and commitment. If any of these elements are lacking, the team is going to lose. The company will get shot to pieces and combat and men will die. I learned there is no margin for error in both and the only way to be perfect is to demand perfection and never Brooke excuses. There you go.

Speaker 3:          00:17:07       That's life. I mean, you know at that point especially then that is, that is your world. That is your life, the military. So unique in that other jobs you can leave at 5:00 PM 6:00 PM whenever you go home from work. Hey, I am no longer an accountant. Now I'm Jimmy, now, I'm Sarah, now I'm, I'm whomever. Right? But in the military, if you're bad at your job, you're a bad person. And that's kind of how you're looking at know if, you know, it's, it's true. If you, if you're an infantry officer and you're not good if you're in, if this isn't everything you eat, sleep and breathe your week. I mean that's just, that's just the kind of environment we have. And, and I always tell the story when people look at me like crazy. I tell him this story had a marine named James Brown, no affiliation with, with the famous person.

Speaker 3:          00:17:56       And, and James is a great marine. He was a tough, tough kid. And he was in a machine gun posts, uh, watching over a main avenue of approach. And his job was to make sure that it stayed clear. He had the best topics, keep it clear of ids, make sure nobody plants an IED there. And everything was bulletproof around him except for the one slit where the two 40 golf went through and it was hot 125 degrees. And, and people always ask me, why are the Marines so extreme? When you make statements like that, discipline, commitment there, everything, everything has to be perfect. I tell them the story. It got hot. James leaned against the rifle to get a little breeze through that slip and that moment got shot in the head by a sniper and died. It was an amazing shot when we went up there and looked at where, I mean in Iraq they had some very, very good snipers as we know, right?

Speaker 3:          00:18:48       But not one split moment. I lost that marine and everything. We do everything you do to perfection. That's why you demand perfection in everything you do because you are so afraid that they're not going to come home alive. And I had to tell my marines just one time, they were lacking in some of their standards. This is in Iraq. I made them stand uniform inspections. Imagine their attitude is, I made them stand three uniform inspection today and they were so mad. But in leadership, you can't do something like that without telling them to why they're not going to buy it. They're just going to hate you now. And I told him, I said, listen guys, we're not stranded. We're not strapping down our ammo and the Humvees well enough. We're not cleaning our weapons right after mission. Like we should be not wearing our uniforms.

Speaker 3:          00:19:29       We get back to camp because you think you're so cool cause you've been in a bunch of firefights. If we don't do the little things right, it's going to affect the big things. And ultimately what's going to happen is we are going to die, we're going to lose or the people we're here to protect are going to die. Therefore I'm going to do these uniform inspections until all of these things are fixed permanently and I am totally fine with you hating me right now. If that means I will deliver you home alive with the mission accomplished, I'd rather you be alive and hate me. Then you guys love me cause you think I'm super cool but then have you guys die because of my poor leadership and my inability to keep you guys discipline and keep you to the standard of perfection and, and that is something, it's hard for.

Speaker 3:          00:20:13       People haven't been in that circumstance. It's hard for them to understand. It really is. But even in my current job running a nonprofit, I, I tell my staff, every single veteran they speak to every conversation, whether it's the 10 times you talked to that vet and you're doing another practice interview, our job is to help them find the American dream, to leave the military by their own choosing and now find not a job, but a great career where they can thrive. And if we take any conversation with them for granted, they may no longer want to take our advice. They may go at it alone, they may not the right thing and we failed them. People give us money not to fail them. Your paid with other people's money that they gave us to help these vets get jobs. Period. If we're not doing that, then you don't work here anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:21:01       I don't work here anymore, period. We will find somebody else to do it because that's our job. And so you've got to set that standard. But if you don't tell them the why behind it, they'll never understand that. And it doesn't mean that we have this, this culture is not like my platoon had this culture where we were all so hardcore and there was no compassion, there was no personality. There's no smiles as you can attest to look, you can have an environment of discipline, hard work and commitment, but still have a lot of love, compassion in good times. You had fun, a lot of straight up. You know, it's great fun when you go and you train and you're awesome. You don't have a lot of fun. The New England patriots, they have a hell of a lot of fun and you went to a discipline and commitment and hard work. That's why they're on the top and they have a lot of fun smile at the end of every season. Everybody hates on them and they're raising the trophies. So

Speaker 1:          00:21:55       you got this section in the book that talks about what you're talking about right now, the leadership factory, right? So here I'm going to go to the book. All the academic classes in the world will never teach anyone to be a leader. The academy recognized that long ago and while we had to take courses on the subject, we learned by doing the academy is structured to provide leadership opportunities in a wide variety of places and levels from the very first day you start as plebes, and this is emphasizing what you just said and discipline is something that I talk about all the time and, and you know, it's great as you know, as I was talking to you on the way over here, you know, I do, I do all of these, I read these leadership or not leadership books, they're not books about leadership.

Speaker 1:          00:22:44       There are about combat, right? But combat is about leadership. So all these books, all of them, every single one of them, whether it's an ancient Roman military leader or a marine in Vietnam or an army soldier in World War II, they all, there is one common thing that's disciplined, disciplined, discipline. It's always there. Back to the book, discipline forms the cornerstone of any military team and of course punishment serves as one of the means to maintain discipline. During my junior year, I learned not to be afraid to mete out punishment. At the same time. Doing so requires a balance of appropriateness and understanding, so that's the why you just talked about right there, and this again goes to something that I talk about a lot, which is, which is the dichotomy of leadership, which is in leadership. There's, there's opposing forces that are pulling you into different directions and both of them are right.

Speaker 1:          00:23:42       They're both right. It's right to be hard on your guys and maintain discipline and it's right to love you guys and take care of her. You have to balance those two and that's what you're talking about right there. That's what you were talking about when you were, when you were talking about they need to understand why they're being punishment, punished back to the book. Bad officers try to be buddies with their marines. There's a fine line between getting to know you're getting to know the men under your command and bonding with them as friends. It is all too easy to make that mistake at the same time. Here's the balance. At the same time, if a young second lieutenant doesn't make an effort to know his men, his aloofness becomes a drag and will hinder his ability to command in several ways. First, you won't understand the strengths and weaknesses of his squads. More important, he won't have the respect or the connection needed to motivate and lead. In the worst of circumstances, men will follow other men into the worst possible circumstances if they respect and believe in their leadership like all other aspects of command. It is a delicate balance.

Speaker 4:          00:24:46       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:24:46       so you're, you're just everything you just said. You say it in the book and

Speaker 4:          00:24:52       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:24:52       that's why you're talking about the leadership factory, but it's interesting. This is stuff that I'm sure they touched on it in the classes, but that's the stuff that you learn. You learn it from senior enlisted people, you learn it from other officers, you learn it yourself, you work for people and you go, man, this guy's aloof. This guy's not talking to us. So it's stuff that we learned ourselves too. I'm going to finish this section up. I concluded the proper balance here depended on the officer's ability to listen and accept input while still making it clear that he was the ultimate decision maker. That was the key. A second lieutenant couldn't be afraid to engage in frank and productive dialogue with his key leaders. A platoon becomes the reflection of its commander. He sets the example, and this is from what you just said, if his uniform is jacked up, his men won't care about their own. This leads to disciplinary issues and becomes a very slippery slope. The only way a second lieutenant can have the moral authority to set a high standard is to set a high standard for conditioning and appearance is to Stevie example himself.

Speaker 4:          00:25:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:59       Without conditioning, opportune cannot achieve its potential in the field. Aggressiveness suffers.

Speaker 4:          00:26:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:06       Appearance breeds pride and reinforces discipline and a spree decor. So those, that's the leadership factory that you're talking about and clearly those things that you brought from the football field and from the academy, you apply them right directly into your folks in combat. They helped and, and you know the Marine Corps has a really unique circumstance where they have the basic score. Every single officer goes there and that's huge to set this huge standard. Then we go a step further where when we go to infantry officer course, that course was 13 weeks long. One of the very hardest, if not the hardest, the Marine Corps,

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       mentally, physically, everything. You don't know anything that's coming, everything's a surprise. But I felt that my instructors during our course were phenomenal and they were getting all the real time intelligence from the battlefield. All the training was realistic. But in terms of how you relate to your marines from your junior enlisted to your, your middle rank, to your senior enlisted, how you relate to the senior enlisted from the battalion who worked directly for the battalion staff. How you manage those relationships to maximize the effectiveness of your platoon, to make sure that you can get exactly what they need. They did such a good job of that. Then you take it one step further. When I reported third battalion, Second Marines, I'd be remiss if I didn't give credit to a guy by the name of Gabe Diana, who is a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps now I believe, but he taught me he was a true student of leadership and military history.

Speaker 3:          00:27:38       He would tell me all the time, his craft is his hobby. There's nothing else he cared about. It's what he was. He loved being a marine, love being an officer, and he taught me a lot about decentralized leadership, how to not micromanage, how to empower your junior leaders, that they start to think like you and you could achieve tempo on the battlefield and you could immediately see examples of marines. I call it, and I see it all the time in the business world. I call it JV leadership, where I'm a great leader if my people love me and they're the same leaders that will tell their people, our it guys today, we've got to stay 30 minutes longer because headquarters said so, look, I disagree with it. I think it's ridiculous, but we have to do it, so let's just sit here together. Now none of their people are actually going to work motivated.

Speaker 3:          00:28:27       There'd be no discipline. There's going to be no standard that they're trying to achieve because of that horrible leadership JV or angry at headquarters. Absolute, they're there. They're Batman at the chain of command. Exactly as JV leadership, and I'm constantly trying to talk to people about that. A JV leadership. The first thing of it is you think you have to be loved to be an effective leader. If you are an effective leader over the long term, you will be loved. But there's going to be intermittent parked where they can't stand you. They don't understand things all the time or they're gonna be mad at you and their cause it. Cause there are emotional but over long term they're gonna understand that what you did was best. The other, the second major part to JV leadership is thinking, Hey, I'm in charge, therefore I come up with all the great ideas and I'm going to make every single decision without your input and I'm gonna, I'm gonna really try hard to make sure that he knows I am in charge.

Speaker 3:          00:29:15       That's ridiculous. It is not your job to come up with all the great ideas. Some of the best ideas I received were from 19 year olds, 21 year olds who had already been direct ones, had a grace or I got a great idea. Well, I want to hear all about it's, it's, it's our job as leaders to decide which are the best ideas to invest energy, time, and resources in. And that's not just, I get all this stuff all the time. When I talked to different groups and companies, well, military leadership is different than corporate leadership. Why? What am I saying here that does doesn't apply. Well, it, it's too extreme. It is not, you're taking us too literal with, with, with, with our warrior mentalities here, you know, the, that you do not need to be an insecure. The best leaders are not insecure.

Speaker 3:          00:30:01       They're secure. They know that they're there and ultimately gonna make the final decision. But it empowers your people and you could achieve tempo when you're decentralized enough that they feel good about coming up with ideas, sending them up to you to get back up for it and get resources behind it. But also knowing that they can make the appropriate decisions at their level because they know what your final intent is. Here's the outcome I want achieved. You get us there. You're the expert at it. That's why I hire Jim. I didn't tell my machine gunners how to work their t and e system and how to cite in their machine guns. Right. I just told him what I wanted them to hit their better than that. It me taking the time to spend it with my marines in their different functions and aspects and talk to them about how they're, they're the expert and compliment them like that.

Speaker 3:          00:30:46       It made them feel great. It does wonders for a leader to go to their level, see what they do every day and see that expert work cause they don't expect you to be an expert in all of that. They know that, right. Your job is different, your responsibilities are different. You, you need to have greater perspective. But when you go to their level in respect, what they do and show them respect for what they do and how they do it, man, it's a powerful thing that that could, that could make a group of people so much better collectively than they ever would have been individually. And when it happens, right, when it finally, when you finally get there and can achieve that, it is, it is awesome. It's the most rewarding experience you could ever have. And it's hard for people to, to understand because most people, they, well, the most rewarding experience you guys probably have is killing people.

Speaker 3:          00:31:34       No, it's so much different than that. So much different. There's so much more to it than that. Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting too that by the way, what you're saying right now is basically the entire book that my buddy Leif Babin, this is the mood. There's a chapter in there called decentralized command with everything you're saying. So, but, and that's why you know, you've come up in a completely different, you know, in the Marine Corps. I was in the, in the, in the navy and yet, you know, you and I have both. I can tell right now basically completely aligned leadership principles. Isn't it interesting though that some guys don't get it if he don't get it and you could explain it to them and you'd say, listen man, hey, you don't need to make every decision. And in fact, when you get out in a firefight, you won't be able to make every decision.

Speaker 3:          00:32:22       You're going to have to let your leaders lead and you're going to let have to let and the, and they would listen to you and you could see it going right through their head. It's wild. You wonder what psycho psychological he is going on in there that makes you want to rebel. And a lot of times it's, hey, they got a bad review from officer said, this is their way of saying, you know, hey, uh, you know, go fly a kite. You know this, this is their way of rebelling. I noticed that with some officers. Um, and in some of the, you know, I had, I had a fire lieutenant during my second deployment and, and he had this problem, you know, he kept feeling he had to be best friends with his marines. He spent way too much time with them talking about a lot of personal stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:33:00       They'd be out on patrol and nobody would listen to them. I mean it was almost straight Muni. And then when I had to fire him and here was the thing is, and tell them, look, you're a really good person and you are most likely going to be very successful in whatever you choose to do. So please, please remember that. It's hard to hear that now this is a very unique job and we are in a very dangerous dinner and we were already in Iraq and we were in a dangerous area at the time and things were about to go south and I had to remove this kid now before things got worse. And it was hard for him to understand that you can be a phenomenal human being, a great person, but just not meant to lead, especially in in those circumstances. But it's, it's some people, and I think it obviously, if they have so many years growing up in a household where it was so different from what they're being taught, that I think sometimes is the route for them to push back against this type of leadership.

Speaker 3:          00:34:00       No. You know, I've been taught differently for years and years. It's Kinda like, well how did you just block it all out for the, you know, year and a half you've been in school before you got here with guys with all this combat experience and not to mention the hundreds of years of history of combat experience saying, look, this is the best way to do it. Yes. And saying, no, I'm going to do a different thing. I mean, the military is a business. It is a business. It's run like a business and the leadership there, it's about maximizing the potential of all the human beings that you have on your team. And how do you do that? Yes, it involves tactics and in what we do is different, but the, the, the personal, the small unit down to the large unit leadership is all the same. It's all the same.

Speaker 3:          00:34:45       And you go around and you talk to different executives who are having trouble. Well, you know this, you know, it's the millennials and what they do and what they do in this do, and we were talking about in the right here, people, the experts always want to blame some kind of process. I think you're processing your information flow is wrong. And the way that you have your workflow set up in the office space that's causing this issue in communication. No, it's not. You're saying that because you are afraid to have the hard conversations with the leaders who are failing, which by the way, you're one of the leaders. Yes. So when you're failing as a business and you've got these issues, yeah, it's breathe, you're going to be one of the problems and you might need help squaring that away. And that's okay. That's okay.

Speaker 3:          00:35:26       I'll do you know what? Another thing I noticed in business world is a lot of people in the business world, they have no leadership training. So they've figured it out, they've been lucky and successful and they've gotten by with good and then they get to a certain point where all of a sudden they're going, wait a second, I can't handle this anymore. That you know, if you grow from six people that you know pretty well that you trust and all of a sudden you've got a staff of a hundred people. If you don't start learning how to lead, you're going to have significant problems and it's going to blow up. And that happens from a hundred people to 300 people in it, from 300 people to a thousand people. It'll happen every time. And you've got to train those leaders throughout the chain of command that all have the same understanding of the fundamental principles of combat leadership, which is leadership.

Speaker 3:          00:36:07       You have the thrill combat in there. Cause that was my old job. It's funny you bring it up. There's a great example. Dan Quinn is the current head coach. At the Atlanta Falcons. He was a defense coordinator at Seattle, hires the head coach in Atlanta and through his, he's a very good friend of Jake Lazar who's obviously very involved in mixed martial arts and does a lot of the Fox broadcast and I've worked with him and gotten close with them and so Jay introduced me to Dan. Dan was looking to make the team tougher in and here's a guy who has achieved the highest level of leadership and coaching, just like you talked about. He was a great coordinator. Now he's a head coach and he had the humility to seek out experts from all, I mean he went to different sports, talk to their head coaches, he went to the military, he went all over with humility to ask and get advice and glean experience other people's time and leadership to include, I couldn't believe it, but here I am having breakfast at demand here.

Speaker 3:          00:37:02       I'm in his office or I'm in there and, and you know their little cafeteria. There were just talking leadership and he's talking about some of these individual guys and he's actually listening to my opinion. Wanted to hear what I went through, my opinion on this guy or that guy is, he brought me in to do some martial arts drills to make the team tougher, but I gained so much respect for that. Here's a man who's achieved the highest level. He knows he's in charge, he's not out to prove anything. His guys know he's in charge and when they don't meet the standard there's a consequence. But at the same time he shows them the same kind of humility as he seeks out advice to get better every day because he wants them. Hey Julio Jones, I know you think you're the best wide receiver in football, but there's ways you can get better and you need to be humble enough to find them.

Speaker 3:          00:37:46       And guess what? Julio goes first in every drill. The dudes that, I mean he at that, I've watched him work as hard as any human being I've seen in the football field, always looking to get better. Matt Ryan the same and look at the position of the teams and now, but he has continually done that. He turned to navy seals last summer, brought seals and to work with his team to work with him on leadership, on accountability and all this combat but leadership leaders and bring it into that locker room and create this cohesive unit that has had a tremendous turnaround from the 2015 season to now 2016 yeah. Yeah. Now to championship again for you reciting my book, which is what to do, cause we were in a chapter there, it's called check your ego. And you know, my point is the number one, the number one characteristic that a leader has to have his humility.

Speaker 3:          00:38:34       And if you don't have that, all those things that you just talked about, you won't do any of them. You won't ever get better. You won't listen to anybody else. You won't take any advice. You can't. That's a horrible thing. Um, let me, let me, let me get us back on track to your life a little bit here. Uh, why did you pick the Marine Corps? Because I couldn't swim in all honesty. You know, I had thought for a while that I wanted to be a team guy playing football and trying to be a cla. It's extremely competitive. You know, the guys who went into the teams and I mean physical specimens discipline, they're incredible. They train for four years to then go and and do all these different screeners. Uh, and for me not having spent four years in the pool was costly because when it came time for me to do this screen or to go do mini buds, it was basically a mini hell week for four straight days.

Speaker 3:          00:39:27       The academy, it was tough and we broke the ice and the Chesapeake, all of that, you know, I trained for it for two weeks. Right. I still had a shoulder problem in hamstring prompt and the season, I mean it was just not going to, I was not going to compete with these guys for, um, but ultimately what attracted me was the Warner racket started. Lot of my buddies were, were in the march up that I had played with that were, you know, graduated before me. I had talked to some folks that were in special operations and seals and they talked about it and it's a smaller team, so it's a little bit different. Whereas in the Marine Corps, the leadership, you know, very young age, you're going to have 40 some marines. You'll go on to be a company commander at this level, you're going to get a legitimate opportunity to command large scale units.

Speaker 3:          00:40:15       And, and that was really appealing to me. Um, and, and I thought that that was probably the best opportunity for me because if I was going to try to then be a team guy, I was going to have to go into the navy as a surface warfare officer. And then after two years and then after two years as rough try to get to butts and there's no guarantees. Being a seal is extraordinarily competitive. And the physical requirements as officers to to get there are really, really high. And so for me, the, the Marine Corps had an amazing appeal and which we know about the Marine Corps. When you went to the Naval Academy though? I wasn't. I, I did as soon as I went to plebe summer. Cause they run it, they run it. And I'll tell you a lot of the, a lot of the people at the naval, Kevin, when I was there, hated the marines.

Speaker 3:          00:40:57       Really. So many of them went there with a chip on their shoulder. You, this is the naval academy. There's no marine corps stuff and it's when we get our opportunity, we're really going to be jerks. And we had this great lieutenant colonel when I was a senior and we had all been selected to be Marines who told us, look guys, this is not the real Marine Corp. They're not representing as well. We've got a bad crop here right now that are, that are trying to prove a point. When you get to the basic school, you're gonna find that it's massively different. And I loved, I loved everything about it. I loved the diversity of my marines. I mean we talk about race and race is a big deal. Racism in our country, it's a big topic. I mean there's constantly battles on all the, the Hollywood news sites going on about about race

Speaker 1:          00:41:44       didn't exist when I was in the Marine Corps.

Speaker 3:          00:41:47       Men from all over the world, dark green marine. It didn't matter. It did. It did not matter if we didn't care. Everybody, Hey, this is so and so the salt. We didn't care. We had a mission every day. We trained together, we bled together and it was phenomenal. None of that stuff existed because we won together. We suffer together and we look beyond all of it. It just doesn't matter in the military and it's so frustrating to see it. It matters so much here in the regular world where people have all kinds of preconceived things and some people are out there acting like they're fighting on for the, for the better of of race relations in our country and they're making it worse because they've got their own personal agenda as they do it. It's just really frustrating.

Speaker 1:          00:42:33       Yeah. Well, I definitely in the, in the military, like you said, everyone's wearing the same uniform and the, I'm sure in the fifties and sixties and even into the 70s, it was a big deal and they stamped it out because it, it, it doesn't matter. There's no factor one way or the other. It's no factor that it's pretty awesome. Uh, yeah, went to the basic school. You, uh, you got stalled in the basic school for a little bit of time and you know, going through some legal stuff and while you're stalled at the basic school, your friends start going on deployment and all of a sudden you got your classmates, your friends, your brothers are getting killed and you know, that feeling of being on the sidelines. Um, I think it's really hard to explain to people and you, and you do a good job in the book that I'll, I'll highlight a couple of times, but, uh, I heard this quote one time, man, I'm not, I'm going to throw it out there as best I can. But for, for women, like they have an intrinsic biological desire to have children. Not all women, but a lot of women let's say, and a lot of men have an intrinsic desire to go to war. I don't know why that is.

Speaker 3:          00:44:02       I know I had it since I can remember having human emotions. I wanted to go to war, you know what I mean? When you're a kid, the first thing you do when you pick up a stick is you shape it into a gun and start pointing it at your friends and trying to kill them. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:44:18       So here you were on the sidelines sitting back and, and your friends are starting to get killed. Well how, what did that do to your psychology? It was,

Speaker 3:          00:44:31       it was dark. It was psychologically, that was the most challenging time period of my life. You've got someone challenging your character and your honor trying to say that you, that you were something that you weren't and I wouldn't allow it. They were, there were easier ways to speed up the process and I refused. No Way. I know what happened. And, and during that delay it was a very, very dark period and, and it was difficult, but you have to, you have to slow life down some times, gain perspective and realize, hey look, this is going to take some time. Eventually I am going to get there. But what, what really it turned into when the opportunity finally came to progress using my time wisely. The war wasn't going to go away tomorrow. You know, sometimes you get this feeling in your mind like, Oh man, my friends are out there dying.

Speaker 3:          00:45:24       They're leading. I need to be with them right now realizing wall, it's not going to be gone tomorrow. So don't be so anxious. Don't waste the time you have now to get better. What can I do? I'm not going to let this stupid instance hold me back from improving from when I eventually do go on to lead marines. And so I found a way to contribute value. I found a way to get better. It didn't happen right away. You know, there was a couple of weeks where where it was dark, where I was angry but I snapped out of it because there's times in life where life and your psychology, they want it. You want to be the victim, right? You want to feel like you've been wronged and the problem is is a lot of times when you go into that mode and you start playing the victim, you never crawl out of it.

Speaker 3:          00:46:13       You get stuck in that world of the victim. You get stuck in this world that you think is all bad lock and everything's always going against you and you stop driving. You know your own life. You got to crawl out of that. When, when, when your, when your mind is telling you to play the victim and to feel bad for yourself, nothing positive comes from that. Some nothing. Did something specific snap you out of that mindset that your, your mom tell you something or you must read it. They talk about that. Oh that's right. That's right. Yeah, she did. Is she my, my, my mom is the sweetest woman in the world too. But there are specific time in my life where she was extremely hard on me and they've mama stay where they were at the right times. You would, you'd meet her knight in a quick kind of, she's such a pushover.

Speaker 3:          00:46:57       Um, but there were times where, hey, you're going to fight this. You understand me, you're gonna fight this. You're right. That's it. And you move forward and, and you, oh, just like we owe the, the friends that you lose, there are many different ways that we could remember them, that we can memorialize them. Some people choose the wrong way, in my opinion, substance, alcohol, depression. You know, they, they choose more of a victim mindset way of remembering them. Others choose, hey, there are no longer here. I can't bring them back. What would they want me to be doing? What would make them proud? I take their life for granted if I use them as an excuse to be idle and fail. Right? But I'm a more, and if I remember them, speak their name and talk about them as I move on and I succeed and, and I still think about that.

Speaker 3:          00:48:01       I think about Ronnie Winchester who I played football with who died now came from Iraq. I think about Brett Harmon who was killed at an NC state football tailgater before he could even lead his platoon to battle. And those incidents happen again while you're on the sidelines. And the other thing you started doing right now at that time period is what does that saying when the, when the student is ready and instructor will appear? Well, you ended up at the Marine Corps, the Martial Arts Center for excellence and you started training. I did. I ran into to a colonel named Joe [inaudible], who is just this phenomenal guy, all about character. I mean in his sixties could outrun all of us. I mean the epitome of discipline, discipline, discipline. And he brought me in. I started working there and I got further introduced into martial arts and I loved it. I found, hey, this is what I should be doing in my free time.

Speaker 3:          00:48:56       I should be in heavy bags. I should be trained and I should be watching tape. I need to beat we. If I'm not reading military history and learning about my enemy, I'm doing this stuff, this, this is the type of stuff that's going to keep my mind sharp. And then I got intrigued. I wondered, okay, I'm going to lead marines in combat. And a lot of these books that they were making us read on killing and some of these books that, that in my opinion are a little off on the psychology, the psychology of battle. Agree. I mean, just brutal guy. You're gonna pee yourself before he gets shot at actually negative. I'm not going to be myself, so I wondered. All right, well what can get me ready for that anxiety? Sign up for a fight. I had this master gunnery sergeant who was a really good kickboxer who worked at this martial arts center of exos and a master, a master guns.

Speaker 3:          00:49:42       Will you train me for fight? Can you get me like one of these, these martial arts fights out in town? Yes sir. I can get you one. Are you going to show up? Yeah, of course. I'm going to show up. I don't know. Sorry. I get a lot of you officers that don't. So anyways, I convinced him to train me every morning at five in the morning. We're training. I had six weeks is fine. I don't know much. Right. I've got, I've got a black belt in the Marine Corps martial arts program, right. That's an arm bar from the guard and armbars from the mount a suite and how to escape them out and I don't, I've never shrimped before. All right. I don't know. A Butterfly Guard is, I have no clue at half guard is all right. I've got a jab cross and [inaudible] ready for your first, the black belt, you said that was a black clothes black.

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       I've got a Jab, a cross in the lake. Understand. Let me just, all right, so I get it. It was my first amateur fight. We weigh in and the guys older than me and he's got the same haircut as Chuck Ladell and he's pretty ripped and so you'd weigh in the same day as the fight. So we all leave now it's time to eat and then you come back. And so I come back and I'm, I'm warm up and he hasn't shown up yet. There's only a little sheet that they hung off a bar in between us and our fights come up in two fights. I'm like, man, this guy may not show up. So this is the perfect scenario for me. He doesn't show, he was scared. I go out with all my marine buddies in the crowd or, I mean, there's 50 people at despite and 15 and we're there to watch me and that makes it work, right?

Speaker 3:          00:51:07       And so, uh, he shows up and he's warming up. He stretched and I'm like looking through the sheet like, oh, maybe I need to do some of that too, you know, I don't want to tell them. Anyways, we walked down this tarp, the fight starts and this dude, he hits me with the worst spinning back fist you've ever seen. I mean, slow motion off balance. My head's so big. Anything you throw at it hits any damn way. But it's me at the spinning back fist and I'm starting to get embarrassed. He's coming at me aggressive and and now is that decision point. Okay, I can mentally break now and kind of cover up and get outta here if this is a little uncomfortable for me. And at that point I kind of snapped and I got mad and so I go to try and take them down, which I have no wrestling football.

Speaker 3:          00:51:51       He read, I tried to football, he wraps up a guillotine on me full on, wraps the legs around my waist and he is hammered it everything. He's got you here and it's tight. I make a few of the lights going on. I'm like, oh my goodness. No. And I could hear his corner man yelling to him. It's his wife. It's now, not only am I going to get capped out in the first round, I'm going to get tapped out to a fake chocolate Lbu quarter by his wife, finished in cherry phase two. This does happen. I find a way out of the choke. I kicked him in the leg and realize who I kick cardiac like that. And then I'd crack him in the forehead and I split his head open. The doctor comes in, he doesn't know what month it is and the fights over.

Speaker 3:          00:52:34       And, and I had, there was a bunch of Vietnam vets in the crowd and they're hammered. And as soon as I get out these dudes, these guys, he's crusty, fellas throw their arms are, I mean, spilling beer all over me there. They're feed me that, you know, they're putting the beer down my throat from their cup with, they got dips in there. I mean, this stuff is probably disgusting. I hate, but it takes it so good. And from that moment on, I was hooked. You know, at this is this is what I should be doing. I had six weeks of a fight on my mind. If I can get used to that, how, how will I deal with the anxiety of, of unprepared for battle. Hey, we're on patrol. You know, we get contact. What's our media action? Or we're going to have a major operation coming up in six days. I have to be able to think clearly on the battlefield. Direct lead play chess. And so I thought, man, this fighting thing could be a key. It could be a help. And it certainly did not end up being that, but it ended up being my sanctuary through it all. It was, it was kind of what centered me. I brought typepad to Iraq the first time, you know, I had one, oh one of my sergeants, a pretty good martial arts. We would train in between missions. I would train my guys.

Speaker 1:          00:53:42       See that's the difference between the seal teams and the and the Marine Corps. You brought tie pads. I brought maps like I had Matt rooms. That's ridiculous. The budget, the budget is much, much. I know it seems like almost embarrassing for me to admit. You know, you also did a lot of wrestling drills with uh, with Travis Manion who was one of your, one of your buddies. And so he helped you out. And there's a, there's an interesting part in, in the book where you talk about, you and Travis are going to, Brett, who you just talked about, you're going to his funeral. This is the guy was shot at some little scuffle as he stayed. Tailgater there's a real shot in the chest and killed. You guys are going to his funeral and the wrestling coach tells you guys to write your own eulogy for yourselves, for yourselves. Interesting drill. That's a, that's an interesting drill.

Speaker 3:          00:54:39       Joel share it. He is the head coach at the naval academy wrestling team right now and it was wild, you know, so Brett harm was a marine infantry officer. He was in third battalion, second marines, which would be my eventual battalion. Went to an NC state football tailgate or there were some guys there drinking and driving and they almost hit a kid and so they, him and his buddy from Chicago civilian right out front of the car and stopped him and they got an argument. What are you guys doing? You know you guys are drunk. Should be driving. The guys get out. They started to scuffle Breton. His buddy one came back a couple hours later and shot them both point blank, shot breadth buddy in the face and Brett went to get them to take the gun from, he got shot in the chest and they died.

Speaker 3:          00:55:16       And so he was interesting because as we were writing this eulogy, you know, me and Travis, we were so close and he was a, he was a fantastic wrestler and one of the toughest human beings I've ever known. I mean what we used to do to each other was ridiculous training. I mean if it, as long as it was standing, I would, I would just destroy them. As soon as he got sick of that and wanted to tackle me on the ground, I wasn't getting up anymore and he was destroying me. But it would just go back and forth for hours and instead of playing video games, drinking beer, going out and hitting on girls, that's what me and Travis would do on a Friday and Saturday night. And it was really tough when you really start to think, what do you want to be said when it's all over for you?

Speaker 3:          00:55:57       How do you want to be? Remember? And, and I remember Travis, he really struggled with this struggled. I mean, it was, I mean, he was so loud talking about that it real from the plane. It was weird. And, and part of it was because we were just struggling with the fact that, you know, our friend is dead, you know, for such a weird circumstance. Yet we can understand if it was an IED or a snipe or something that and that, not this. And, you know, several years later it was wild. But, uh, you know, Joel share it when he would give Travis's eulogy, he brought that story up. Travis would get killed in Fallujah. And I remember driving up to Travis this funeral and Ah, you know, Travis is one of those guys that you just, you just never, he can't die. He's Jesus. Too Bad. He's too tough.

Speaker 3:          00:56:44       He's too smart, too good. So remember driving up to the funeral and I had my, my wife there with me and she was actually trying to make plans for their twin sister. Hey, we're going to be in town. We live in North Carolina. Let's get together this weekend. But her twin sister's husband didn't want to get together. There was a part of me that didn't Travis's in debt like, I'm going to get there and we're all gonna, we're gonna hang out tonight. And I remember when I walked into that week and I actually saw him, I mean it, it hit me like a ton of bricks. It was brutal. I loved, love that guy so much and we carried him the next day. But uh, you know, it's just, it's so crazy how connected it was because

Speaker 3:          00:57:24       Ronnie Winchester died in, I'll Chi my rack and three days later, Brett and died at that NC state football game. We would go to Brett Harmon's funeral, right? Or on eulogies, which you'll share it, who would then end up giving Travis Mannion his you has actually eulogy and I would carry Travis to his grave. I went to al Qaeda in Iraq and actually replaced Ronnie's platoon and turned over with the replacement platoon commander who took over for him when he passed. While I was an infantry officer course JP blacksmith was killed. And Felicia, and I got this a little out of order, but when, when JP died, I found out right before I had my last amateur fight, I was an infantry officer course. And I'm getting ready to fight in two hours for, for a title Travis Mannion with my corner man. And we're in the hotel room and he got a call and then he looked like he had seen a ghost like trap. What's wrong? You have nothing to do. I'll tell you after the fight.

Speaker 3:          00:58:24       And we, you know, we had gotten bad like, no, I know something's up. What the hell happened? Travis told me do JP blacksmith got killed in Fallujah. So Travis tells you about jps death. I turned over with jps company, my second tour, it's, I met all of his old marines, all of his own platoon commanders. And it's just, it's such a small world that we lived and breathed then, you know, and, and so in, in my little platoon commanders notebook, I had pictures of all of them. And before every mission I would flip through and you just think, how do I make them proud? Before every fight, I would look at their pictures and look at the pictures of my marines. How do I make them proud? How do I make them proud? And I still think about it to this day and I end a lot of my speeches on this and mean they no longer have the chance to live.

Speaker 3:          00:59:09       Who am I to take this life for granted? Because they would give anything to have one more day. Their families who would give anything to have one more day. And I try to remind myself of that all the time. And you don't have to in the military to think like that. People look into, well, that's extreme. Well, who have you lost in your life? What would make them proud? How do you truly memorialize them? It's certainly not through failure. It's not they're being idle in life. Live a life of substance, not just existence in that you know, as you do that and you remember them, that makes them proud, that that makes it, that makes it worth it. You know, it's very similar to that, that final scene in saving private Ryan where he's like, did I earn it? You know? And for those of us who served and wearing in those great circumstances or for those people, there's people that were in tragedies where they were in car accidents. They lost people. They think the same way. They think a lot the way they do that we do when we look at life and taking things for granted. Um, and achieving every day adding value.

Speaker 1:          01:00:07       Yeah. The darkness in the world regardless of, uh, regardless of where you are. You, um, you know, speaking of your combat tours, I want, I want to kind of dive into those a little bit and let's take you, you take over your platoon. You're a platoon commander. Now, back to the book here, during our first platoon meeting, my introductory speech lasted less than two minutes. We're going to be aggressive. I told my new command, we're going to train our asses off and we're going to be, and we're going to work harder than anyone else in the battalion. That was it short to the point, all business. What's more, they found out quickly. I wasn't kidding. So you, you guys work hard, you get prepared, you deploy to Al came, which you just talked about. That's where you ended up going and I'm jumping ahead a little bit.

Speaker 1:          01:01:04       People are going to have to read this whole book themselves, but you're, you're basically now setting up a position on a bridge. You're kind of a blocking force in his bridge, prevent uh, enemy from consolidating on another area where there's another operation going on and I'm going to the book mortars began to fall on our position as we fought back. I made sure that our vehicles moved from one spot to another. So the mortar Cruz would not zero in on us from a wadi that ran perpendicular route. Emerald, several insurgents began lobbying, rocket propelled grenades at us. The rockets exploded all around us. Then another heavy machine gun let loose this one sided on the north bank as well. We were caught in 180 degree crossfire from my window. I could see Corporal Delatour and Bravo one, they were taking the brunt of the fire and delatour briefly dipped out of the Turret as bullets bounced off the Humvees armored skin.

Speaker 1:          01:01:59       Then I saw his hand pop up above the blast shield holding a video camera. It takes a rare kind of cool to do something like that in combat and infantry platoons first task at to achieve fire superiority over the enemy. To do this requires pouring it on the insurgence until they are forced to either disengage or go to ground. Once they're even driven off, either driven off or pinned in place, you've gained command to the fight and can dictate what happens next even with the tanks because I failed to mentioned you had some tanks from army tanks with you and you, uh, throughout the book have the same deep love for tanks that I have for RB tags, Marie Techs, but I love tanks even with the tanks. In this case, we didn't have the fire power to gain control of this battle. There were too many insurgent shooting at us from too many different places. We needed some help. I reached for the radios, headset began calling air strikes within minutes. Huey Cobra gunships thundered in all unseen to deliver deadly Accurate Hellfire missiles into targets we identified. So was this situation here, was that like your first big combat scenario?

Speaker 3:          01:03:11       It was, it wasn't. The thing that made it so difficult was there was another platoon assigned for that mission. Right. And they got stuck, stuck in the mud, in the mud and, and so we didn't get the opportunity to aerial reconnaissance. We didn't have the opportunity to look at overhead imagery of this terrain. We had nothing. I had 15 minutes, hey, if they're not there in 15 minutes, you're a go. So in that 15 minutes, I'm briefing my guys, we're getting ready, we're now, we're meeting this, this tank crew is from Boise, Idaho. We'd never even met them. I met them the day before. My guys had never worked with them before. So there was a lot of confusion that took place just in the, in the route up. And as we got settled and started identify targets, and as you know, in that scenario, the acoustics and in the movement, the amount of people, we are the most precise military in the history of this planet.

Speaker 3:          01:04:07       So we not only have to identify where is the gunfire coming from, what caliber do I believe they're firing back or at us with, because that dictates what caliber I'm allowed to return fire with. Depending on where they're shooting at me from. Are they in a dug in position north of the river or they shooting at me from a building where they're civilians around? Are they shooting at me from a wadi where now I can drop hellfires on them. I can hit them with tanks. That's a lot going through your head when you've got four vehicles, two tanks and aircraft you're trying to control as a 24 year old kid and everybody's waiting on you to say what's coming next. Just like in every vehicle, there's another kid in there directing everything they're doing and, and, and that is, that is all part of it. But that, that was our first, our first time when Delatorre I don't put in the book, but what I said to him over the radio, I mean, I, I verbally almost killed him through the radio for doing it, that wild son of a bitch. I've told him

Speaker 1:          01:05:06       the story on the podcast, but I had a similar story. I'll tell it again right now. Cause Mikey Monster, who ended up getting killed in Ramadi, metal of honor, uh, I went to go to his little station where he was and the guys were like, Hey, do you see Mikey's video? And I was like, no, let let you know. And they'll go take a look at Mikey's video. So Mikey was a, uh, a heavy weapons gunner and carry the mark 48. And so I go back into his little word Camp Corregidor in Ramadi. I go back and do a little Hoochie, a built from south. I'm like, Mikey, let me see your, let me see your video. And he goes, I'll Roger that sir. So he pulls out a little camera and he shows the video and there's a massive firefight going on in the lob district of, of Ramadi, and he's got the camera up and you can see it ducked out or go up.

Speaker 1:          01:05:48       He's filming everything and he gets done showing me an, and at one point and the in the video, he turns the camera at himself and he goes, it's the Mooloolaba, which was just classic Mikey and this. So it gets done. And of course I'm all hardcore and I go, hey Mike, bro, what are you doing out there? You know, you're in a firefight. You need to be on your pig gut getting rounds down and killing bad guys. He's like, sir, I'm sorry I was, I was Winchester. He had no, you already dumped a thousand rounds. And I was like, Hey, all right Mike, you're good, you're fine. All you want if you go Winchester. But yeah, I was thinking, how did I read that? I was like, you probably weren't too happy about that.

Speaker 3:          01:06:30       I was so mad. So mad.

Speaker 1:          01:06:33       Another thing. Let me just give you this prompt and you're going to hear this too. When, when you, when you get off this podcast and people are going to hit you up on social media, you're going to hear from young soul, you're gonna hear from soldiers and marines that are going to ask you questions because they listened to this and they get knowledge from it. Is there anything that you didn't expect that you wish somebody would have told you going into that first firefight? For someone that's in basic training right now or at the basic school right now? Anything that you piece of advice you'd give them. Yeah, you know, a few things. You know, one

Speaker 3:          01:07:09       go in their guns ablazing right away because in that circumstance the sound is actually one of your better indicators are where the gunfire is coming from. Cause when that heat is blazing, you're not going to see a muzzle flash. It's just doesn't exist. Right. The other thing is when you're, when you are keeping your vehicles mobile, that doesn't allow you to lock in on a t and e system with a heavy machine gun. So you've got to be smart in the increments that you move in and the formations you move in and make sure that your, your machine gunners have drilled that we would do, we would do t and he drills till my guy's hands bled and not just the, the primary machine gunner. Everybody in that trucks have one goes down, the other comes up so that it, when we moved them they can quickly get back on that same target.

Speaker 3:          01:07:53       Cause basically what that became a game of is you suppress that position with a two 40 golfer, a medium machine gun until I can talk the tank top on. And then the tanks, they don't miss. It's all computer. It's like a video game. And we'd dug in positions, just aim a little bit lower and watch the shit fly, excuse my language. Um, but that, that was one of the prompts when when we went in and we started receiving some, everybody started shooting fire where we can identify with. But then also we're getting shot at from other positions. We can't really tell because of the acoustics until somebody actually hits wait, waiting. But we're getting hit for back here too and then some of the increments might, my drivers would move in. They move so much that it was no longer a small adjustment on the teeny for that machine gunner.

Speaker 3:          01:08:33       Now they've got to get out of the turret exposing themselves to work that thing in and because of collateral damage, you can't just work it in, send some rounds downrange, oops, I hit the building 10 feet away. You're not allowed to do that. You've got to get that sucker into where you see it on the site and then you can start sending around down. Well that guy gets to shoot at you because you're so concerned with collateral damage. And so drill, drill, drill because a mortar, drop it on the top of a of a Humvee is not a good thing and they are more accurate than you realize that these, the enemy out there has been launching mortars in indirect fire for decades where you get a little bit of Ammo to do it on range 400 out. You know, I'll out in the, out in the palms from marines edits these guys get to do it everyday for real.

Speaker 1:          01:09:20       Yeah. And you know what? They don't even have to be good. They'd get lucky one time. And, and human life doesn't mean anything to them, but it means everything to us. So they get lucky one time and there's, there's, that's the way it goes and that's the way combat is. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:09:35       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:39       So you get done with that and, and tank hits an IED. You need to find out what's going on. And basically there's a, there's a burning Abrams here going on. Suddenly a huge explosion drowned out all other battle sounds. The ground rolled and shook as if the fault line had suddenly collapsed beneath us ahead. A maelstrom of sand, dirt, smoke and flames boiled skyward before I could even ask Sergeant Peterson's voice came over, the radio mortar hit one of the tanks, my column break to a stop. The explosion morphed into a dry eye into a small, dirty brown mushroom cloud over staff sergeant plump keys. [inaudible] no way a mortar did that. That had to have been massive IED. Luke Miller called over to me. I have no comms with them. So now you radio for a med evac. You're trying to find out what's going on. The tanks on fire and here we go.

Speaker 1:          01:10:36       Back to the book, I took a deep breath and ran for the burning Abrams. I took only a few steps before I saw a Robertson frantically waving back at me. We are sorry, waving me back. Just then a line of bullets stitched across the sand about 10 feet ahead of me. I executed my best football shuttle run and dashed back for cover. Bravo three laid down suppressing fire, which allowed me to get across the open space on my second attempt. So let's cover moving on another thing, chapter in the book. So I'm, I talk about all the time. This is the fundamental, there's a fundamental tactic that's that's what it is. Covered move. Then you guys are doing it right here. When

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       I reached Robertson, he shouted and we still got two wounded in there. We had to get the men out quickly. I climbed onto the tank Miller following a short time later, the incoming fire was heavy and more than once we had to duck behind the turret. So getting your, getting your game on Brian Stann kid. The funny thing about it was I was trying to maintain a low profile when I got in the tank. There's things, there's little micro things you can hide behind and the drivers that the person deepest in that thing and we couldn't get him out. He was the last one and, and he was a bigger guy and I'm, I'm trying to lift them as strong dude. And I lifted way till I was in Iraq and Al is a strong, bigger guy than I am right now. Couldn't get him out and I couldn't and I couldn't understand why.

Speaker 3:          01:11:58       And he's looking at me, he's, he's got blood all over me. It's like, why is this taking so long? And he doesn't say it that clear. I mean he's, he's out of it. I didn't know at the time he was paralyzed from the chest down there. And so I realized the only way I'm getting him out is if I get my legs underneath me and that's going to create a target. And so we think sometimes we think some silly things in combat. And I just thought, look, if I'm going to get shot by these guys, what's the last thing I want them to see before they hit me? And that's my rear end. So when I hopped up, I, I faced that rate towards the foot. I honestly think, I think it would save me, you know, you'll talk to two people that hunt and they talk about when they get that perfect buck in their sites, huge rack.

Speaker 3:          01:12:39       And it's such an easy shop, but they're so excited that they pulled a shot and they miss well, when I've got a Kevlar helmet on, I look who's seen Spaceballs well, yeah, I mean, you can see right now it's just the headset. When I've got to Kevlar on, I mean if someone's trying to snipe me or they're trying to shoot at me with a medium machine gun and they see, they're like, oh man, I got this dude they missed. And I squat, I was able to pull them up and we literally, you know, we, we almost collapsed off the tank and, and landed on top of another guy and got him down. Um, but the only thing I could think of, I mean obviously grateful when we landed, Hey, I don't think I got shot. Did you get hit? He didn't get hit and we were able to get them out.

Speaker 3:          01:13:21       But that was, that was what I think happened is sometimes you just get lucky and I think I presented such a big target, whoever was behind that trigger just straight delusion. Yeah. That's a nightmare too. I'll tell you when, when this enemy sees a down vehicle, it is like a bullet magnet. The fact that you survived that is ridiculous. And yeah, it must, it is a miracle and luck and everything else because when, when the enemy sees a target like that man, they just pour fire onto it cause they know there's creating a total catastrophic situation for us. And they almost always have a camera on it too. Yeah. I mean they are there for film. It, it didn't, I couldn't find it. But they study film, like NFL teams, study film, and sometimes you find their footage where they didn't even attack you. They're just watching what your response was to see what they're going to do next. People underestimate the evil and the detail that they go through. Maybe Akhmed the sniper decided to delete that video because he was going to get in so much trouble for this and the big heading of America.

Speaker 3:          01:14:23       How did you visit this guy? Look at the size of a,

Speaker 1:          01:14:30       so you call him actually, you called an a helicopters. They come in under fire. Don't take any hits.

Speaker 3:          01:14:38       Somehow miraculously have been, I've not been able to find who was flying that Huey. I never was able to find out and I mean I wish I could that that guy who landed because a whole squad was taken out a few clicks to our east and there was no med evac birds and this guy, I mean we laid down in the butterfly trigger so that he could land, but man, he showed some guts. He would've been fired had they got hit. It had that halo going down, but he didn't care. He knew there was a marine there that needed to get out and need to get out now or else he was done and, and he landed, got him and lifted off. And I never saw him again. I'm telling you that that's, that's a real, I was a marine corps as a marine pilot and in a Huey of all things a Huey, um, that took some stones and I wish, I wish I could find that person, hear this podcast reach out. So I hope so.

Speaker 1:          01:15:30       Now you get that back to base helacious run

Speaker 5:          01:15:34       and

Speaker 1:          01:15:36       you guys get back. Yeah. Great. We survived. And then you get re tasked, you got to go bring ammo weapons or sorry, Emma water fuel back up there.

Speaker 5:          01:15:47       [inaudible] and

Speaker 1:          01:15:50       this was an interesting, I got this and I kind of brought it up earlier, but back to the book, just before we rolled out my alpha section arrived back at [inaudible] after a very dull day covering the jump off point for the assault force tasked with crossing the afraid he's, they encountered no opposition. And my Bravo section. Marines quickly busted out the stories of our busy day, much to the jealousy of the rest of the platoon. This is what I was trying to explain earlier. So these guys, you know, these guys were in a crazy firefight, almost get killed. They got guys getting wounded, they come back and the other other squad, he had no action and what are they? They're jealous and mad alpha section was so full of aggressive, angry marines who wanted nothing more to get into the fight. They lobbied to go out on this run. But I vetoed the idea. Sergeant Pete's men knew the terrain now and we needed that experience to shepherd the two trucks to the bridge. I told my alpha section it and plenty of opportunities in the days to come, but I knew as we left the wire, they remained on the base. Frustrated and anxious. That's just tells you what the Marine Corps

Speaker 3:          01:16:58       is all about. Hated me that night, I'm sure.

Speaker 1:          01:17:03       And then, okay, so you do, that's another hell run. And again, I'm not going to read your entire book. People can buy this book and

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       read it, but when you get back again, another just crazy run. When you get back, guess what? You got to go back to the bridge again.

Speaker 4:          01:17:20       Okay,

Speaker 3:          01:17:20       that's good times. So here you go. Back to the book. We're going back to the bridge tonight. I started Alpha, sat out the last couple of fights. They were fresh and eager and ready. Go in the fray right now. Bravo section had all the bragging rights and that was driving Francis's men nuts. When I broke the news, I like this park. When I broke the news I saw no fear in anyone's eyes. Just anticipation and excitement. Be careful what you wish for. I thought so again, marines are fired up to go and you go out again

Speaker 3:          01:17:58       and this one again goes sideways. You, you're using up all your nine man. This. This one got ugly quick and you know, we expected it to, but there was, there were things working against us a little bit in that we had to go up there, the tank that had the catastrophic hill days earlier, we had to go up there and recover it. You can't leave that in the battlefield. And so I had never even, I had never known what a Mike 88 recovery vehicle was. I learned that in Ramadi as well. It's, it's a tank with no guns and it's basically it's, it's a mechanic vehicle. They go fix the other tank or they told him, and so we were going to meet a tank section, so to regular Abrams tanks plus this Mike 88 tank recovery vehicle in the middle of the desert. Here's, here's your grid.

Speaker 3:          01:18:45       We'll meet there. I'm going to kick my order there. I've never even met these marines before. Hey, by the way, here's your introduction to my alpha section, by the way, to we're going to head straight north and try and catch them by surprise and, and get right up to the bridge. But I told them, look, this area has been heavily guarded, so be prepared. Well this master started, who's driving the mic? 88 lets me know, hey sir, just so you know, once we get on that ass fall, this thing only going to go about 10 miles an hour at best. What as you started wait one, we're good on sand when we don't go very fast on on asphalt and like well you don't want to go on sand. You know what they buried in sand force and what they have waiting for us there.

Speaker 3:          01:19:30       So man we hit the line of departure. We had north and they opened up on us and that my kth is crawling, crawling and my section leader steps are in France. His vehicle gets hit with an RPG just missed by an IED, but the back of the vehicle is on fire and, and when we're getting hit to tank, start returning fire. And here's another really good lesson for, for young officers and and and just young service members in general. When you're fighting at night and you got night vision goggles on and and tanks are returning fire into these buildings, right? They were shooting down on us. And these buildings shooting has to windows to the tanks or identity. We're identifying targets and they're taking them out the debris. It's heavy that the material that these buildings are made of, it's very heavy in a blindness.

Speaker 3:          01:20:18       Couldn't see now because all the damage that tanks did and my lead vehicle blew the turn back of the vehicles on fire. They blow the turn. So we all blow the turn and link back up. And now as I looked down the block headache, it's see these lights Blinken which typically tells us it's signaling an ambush. They're expecting us to go that route now, decision time, and you gotta be quick. So at that time we're about to, we're going, hey, let's turn the company around. Let's hit the turn where we know we're going to get right to the people that need us right to that down tank. Let's fight our way through this kills, oh, let me call. And some air strikes that time is when they let loose those suicide vehicles and one got through our perimeter and man, I've, I've one of the Marines actually filmed that explosion and just a horrible femi.

Speaker 3:          01:21:05       I heard that explosion and just the first thing went through my head. I just got five kids killed immediately. It's the first thing that went through my head radio silence and everybody's waiting for, there's no crying, there's no morning, there's no time out. There's no hey staffs are and Robertson. You take over. No, I mean after that thought, my next, my next thing needs to be me giving orders out of my mouth and moving people forward because we don't have time to mourn right now. And, and so immediately I set a perimeter with the tanks. I established which vehicles is going to be the tow vehicle for our down vehicle, where the casualties going to go. Where's the corpsman? And I get out of my vehicle and I pushed it to leaders. Do we go to the point of friction? Where's the point of friction?

Speaker 3:          01:21:41       And that was my vehicle was just hit with a suicide vehicle. Man, I'd get there. And on top of it is this 22 year old kid, Jeff Lampson was built like a number two pencil, right? He was just in this vehicle. I mean this vehicle is destroyed. How he's conscious, I don't know, but he's on top of it pulling our gunner out of the turret who's got a piece of shrapnel in his head bigger than that book. Everybody in the vehicles, everybody's wounded but staff, certain Francis comes out in the whole side of his face, his melt and he's like, sir, we're going to be good. We're going to be, I was never more relieved in my life. They're still getting shot at. Francis is basically walking but he's not totally conscious yet. They're like bullets and I'm a guard. Like I got to grab and put it behind the vehicle for a second cause he's out of it of course.

Speaker 3:          01:22:32       But man to to see Lampson this kid who actually, you know, had a little bit of an attitude at the time was one of the guys I had to correct an awful lot. Hair's a little too long. He tried to grow a mustache and peach fuzz mean he's a kid. You look at the, I mean, you would never imagine that this is a warrior, but in this time of need, I'm telling you man, he was saving lives and it was so humbling and so motivating to see that. And we were able to, we got everybody in that Mike 88 eventually got the toe, got out of there and I mean called in a massive air strike and, and, and we won. But we didn't pitch a shutout, that's for sure. And in that, the hardest part of that was when all my casualties are loaded on, you have, we're not doctors, we have no idea.

Speaker 3:          01:23:17       When you see a guy with shrapnel out of his brain like that, you think they're done. So my marines, they think we may have lost two or three of these folks and they're down. And as far as I know, we're out there to fight for the three, four, five, six that was gas, right? That was shrapnel was head. Was He, was he walking wounded? Was He, so he would, he would come to, he got shot as Lampson was pulling them out of the Turret. He got shot again in the elbow as we were pulling them out. And we got him to the medivac and, and he was just, he was, I remember he was, he was cursing. I can't believe I let them get us. I can't believe I let them get us blaming himself for the suicide vehicle getting to the vehicle. And I told him, it's not you, it's my fault.

Speaker 3:          01:23:55       It's not your fault. And, uh, but at least he was talking. Yeah. But I mean this, I, you know, this is, this is pretty freaky when you see a piece of metal in someone's head just like this. And I don't, he couldn't see himself and I had nobody wanted to tell him. Nobody wanted to say, hey, reach up and touch within your brain right now. Um, but he was gone. I mean, once he left that day, we didn't see him the rest of the deployment. I didn't see him until, till I had gotten back. And the craziest thing is

Speaker 3:          01:24:26       we reunited for an episode of ultimate insider with the UFC. And I didn't really know what they were after. And this, this producer, you know, asked me if I could get this guy there, you're going to do a story. It was really going to be honorable to him, this and that. And, and it was right. But at the same time, he sit in this next to each other and he's asking this marine, hey, do you blame Brian Stann for this happening? Do you blame this for him? I mean, it was, it was, it was dark and it was difficult. And it was, it was hard for both of us, man, because, you know, for gas, it, he lived right in and he's got a family now, but that the amount of headaches, the piercing headaches, this man's struggles with, you know, in and out of Comms, try and text him. I don't know what, you know, we're, we're numbers at, um, he's a great warrior, great dude. But the pain he lives with every day, I mean, at the, this is never going away. He had I think, four brain surgeries after that four brain surgeries, unbelievable and he was blaming himself

Speaker 1:          01:25:23       crazy or yours. Then you know you, you kind of wrap up that here. Going back to the book, our unit three two marines is known as the BTO bastards. In 1943 the battalion took part in operation galvanic the invasion of Tarawa Btu island was the main target of the landing force and the marines faced and the entrenched enemy with preregistered fields of fire on the beaches close. Either don't know what that is. That's an actual nightmare when the enemy already knows where their rounds are going to land, when they fire them because it's a worst case scenario. The first assault waves were nearly wiped out by machine gun and mortar fires and they waited through the lagoon onto the narrow beach. It took 76 hours to kick clear the island, which was barely 2000 yards long and a few score wide. Over 3000 marines and sailors died or fell wounded during what became the most ferocious close quarter battle ever fought by the United States Marine Corps. That was the legacy of my unit, a legacy of determination, heroism, and stoic resolve in the face of unimaginable adversity. On May 10th, 2008 my marines proved they were cut from the same cloth.

Speaker 3:          01:26:50       Indeed, it's so humbling when you watched these young men from all different walks of life, you know, some of them only citizens in the United States for a couple of years at that point. Really diverse backgrounds and me, it's not a gang full of white people. I mean it's, it's very diverse. I mean, they don't care. And Man, when they're getting shot at, there was nobody ducking for cover. Nobody. They are getting after their, their love and care for one another, for the mission, for people trying to destroy their way of life. It's, it's all inspiring to watch their selfless acts. I mean, what they'll do and, and, and this was more obviously direct engagement against an enemy, right? But, but there's, I've seen them, you know, just like Lampson was willing to sacrifice himself to save Robert Gas. Right. I've seen marines do the same to save innocent Iraqi kids the same care that they had for one another they had for the people that they were there to protect.

Speaker 3:          01:27:57       And that gets lost a lot when people talk about these wars. It's, it's become cool to paint our military like we're, we're this brutal force that's wiped out. You know, all these people in these different countries. I mean these, these were men, these were men who were such great professionals, but under the most extreme circumstances understood that they could lose their life and that was a hundred percent acceptable to them. If that meant saving the guy next to him and, and that it's hard for me to meet somebody like Michael stray hand or a football player, famous person, right? They're all impressive people. But it's hard for me to meet someone like that and be like, oh my God, can I get a picture for Instagram when, when you've been around 19 2120 year old kids and these kids don't come from rich background, right? They didn't have a whole lot. There is a reason when the, when our nation was in two wars, they decided to sign up and be infantry in the marine corps. It was, it, they,

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       they, they will forever be that the greatest people I've ever been surrounded with. Yeah. You know, uh, I talk about that all the time. The fact that when we were in Ramadi specifically, you know, here we were, the special operations guys, the Navy Seals, whatever, we, all of us, all of us guys, we just had such admiration and love for the Marine Corps and for the army soldiers that we work with. Those guys like you said, and, and for us, we're sitting there, we're going, man, we've got, we got infinitely more training, infinitely more training then a grunt pass. That's just the way it is. Like you talk about the budget, we used to shoot more rounds in a week, then our Marine Corps company, we're shooting their workup. No kidding. Like we, I saw the numbers. So we get infinitely more training, we get better gear. And yet you go down to the government center and Ramadi or you go down to cop Falcon. And you look at those soldiers and marines that are getting after it every day. And that's why we just had nothing but the utmost highest respect for those guys. And they knew it and that was some nasty fighting down there to NASA funding in Ramadi. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:30:27       I'm going to take us back to the book here.

Speaker 2:          01:30:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:30:31       An Amtrak, a lightly armored amphibious vehicle. First platoon three to five struck a landmine only a few hundred meters from our position. So this is another operation that you're out on. And this is where we started this a day off. We heard the explosion, saw the smoke and flames rising behind us and then heard the cries for help over the radio.

Speaker 2:          01:30:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:30:53       We couldn't go to their aid. The bridge had not yet been cleared and we were almost certain had been mined by the enemy. Besides, we couldn't leave our blocking position without exposing, exposing the left flank. The track burned as three to fives. Fellow Marines and my friend and mentor, Lieutenant Deanna from our weapons company frantically tried to free the men trapped inside.

Speaker 2:          01:31:18       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:31:18       Inside Alpha three I could see this color drain from my men's faces. They look absolutely stricken.

Speaker 2:          01:31:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:31:27       Then the tracks ready. Ammunition began cooking off with each debt nation. I could see my men flinch. I ordered everyone to face south. I didn't want my men to see what was unfolding. Hearing it over the radio was bad enough. Five marines died inside the track. Everyone else inside suffered wounds of varying degrees. The driver was pulled from the wreckage, his face, bloody and missing teeth. The explosion had his head against the vehicles front console. Another marine emerged with his uniform on fire. Quick thinking men nearby got him on the ground and put the flames out with a fire extinguisher vol. My experiences in combat, this is the one that haunts me the most. The feeling of complete impotence in the face of such a profound tragedy scarred us all that day

Speaker 3:          01:32:26       it gave, Diana had actually served in Lima three 25 it's a reserve unit out of Columbus, Ohio before he became active duty and then became an officer. He was an enlisted with three 25 and I remember when when we were starting this operation in three 25 came to our base, him bringing some of these, these guys, hey man, I've been, he grew up with them. I mean these were his brothers and now they were firefighters. They were police officers all brought together for this mission man. It was brutal. Absolutely brutal. And I,

Speaker 3:          01:33:03       I remember hearing a story about this woman from Columbus who they had lost to think of it. It was over 20 names around 22 marines from Lima, three 25 during that deployment. And she decided to paint these beautiful murals murals of each one and they were so nice at the Marine Corps Museum for a while, put them right in their foyer, right as soon as you walk into the museum there they were and they were big. And I remember hearing story and then I was doing a shoot with the UFC in the Marine Corp when the Marine Corps is advertising at the UFC and part of the shoe is going to be us as fighters. And then with the Marines going to the Marine Corps Museum. And I was kind of, you know, both sides of the fence on that. And we walked in and they were there and I didn't know, I didn't expect it.

Speaker 3:          01:33:48       And it was really tough because here I am, you know, I'm, I'm around these marines and I'm around, you know, some of my buddies and Rashad Evans, Forrest Griffin were there. And I mean, as soon as I walked in, man, my eyes filled up with tears, you know, being given the opportunity to meet some of these men very briefly. Then we set off and go. And because of my relationship with Gabe, Diana, who was my mentor at the time, and knowing what he went through that day, childhood brothers of his and, and, and him also being helpless, uh, and nothing's fair in combat. We know that nothing's fair and and you don't have the choice. Again, you don't have the choice that gets cleared on that. Fourth continues to push west so that we can finish the mission of this operation. We got to continue providing our blocking position and that's it. If you lose focus, more of that's going to happen. It's, it's, it's a difficult thing to deal with, but that's what we signed up to do that. That's why we have an all volunteer force and it's the greatest military forces world has ever seen and it's unfortunate, but part of it is dying. We die in battle is that the innocent people here that live in America don't, and it sucks and it's painful, but at the end of the day we, we know when we

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       sign up, we know that that is a possibility.

Speaker 2:          01:35:01       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:35:05       it is. Indeed. Now you had

Speaker 1:          01:35:11       nine guys wounded from your platoon. Is that right? From that, from that whole deployment, from that couple days. Okay. Yeah. Here we go. Nine men in a week. Your, I'll go to the book, but some of them were the reservists tankers that weren't technically mine, but yeah, the loss of so many marines under my command at eating away at me, almost to the point where I suffered a crisis in confidence. Nine men and week of combat. What had I done wrong? What have I done wrong? What lessons could I learn my mind obsessed over those questions. Inside the coc, I braced for the shit storm. Captain Ford Phillips, my company commander, spotted me. As I came through the door, he swiftly took me aside. Here it comes. I thought, Brian, excellent job. You did everything right out there. Thank you. My jaw almost fell open. Those were the last words I had expected to here.

Speaker 1:          01:36:07       I greatly admired captain Phillips and had long since learned. He always meant what he said. His words were never designed to make someone feel better. They were always designed to make a man, a better officer, and a better marine. Always his words ease the pain of the last seven days, but did not erase the guilt that I felt to this day. I questioned the decisions I made that night. That is the onus of command. You always bear the responsibility for those under you when they suffer wounds or are killed by the enemy, it is impossible for an officer not to second guessed himself and own part of their suffering or deaths. As leaders, we understand control. That is where we operate. Having it is comfort, but combat and the enemy strips that away. At times. Once the bullets fly and the violent chaos of a firefight, rains control becomes an illusion. A platoon commander cannot determine which enemy bullets we'll strike what vehicles he cannot select. The moment when an insurgent triggers an IED, he cannot dictate who survives and who doesn't. All we can do is try and fight back to try and demolish the chaos with enough fire power that the enemy dies or runs away. Almost everything else is beyond the leaders control.

Speaker 2:          01:37:27       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:37:28       Those limits of leadership were never drilled into us at the academy. When I experienced it for the first time during Operation Matador, I came gradually to understand on an intellectual level, but in my heart I still wonder if I could have done something else that might've saved my marines from harm. I still spend sleepless nights replaying every moment in my head, hoping men like gas and Jonathan Loewe can forgive me

Speaker 3:          01:38:03       all part of it. Matt and I, it's, it's funny you read that passage. I was up last night, same thing, two 45 in the morning and, and, and replaying it and it, it's not something I would say there's a negative aspect. People will hear me say that and I'm like, Oh man, that's bad. You know, post traumatic stress or something. No, it's me being a human being who cares and wonders and it's hard. It's never going to go away and all always wonder that, you know, would it have been a better decision to take a left turn in, in abort the mission at that point? Should I have tried to get back to the bridge or if I'd have gone three blocks up, maybe there would have been a path we could have found and put her head lights on. There are so many what ifs, so many what ifs that you go through as leaders.

Speaker 3:          01:38:54       And if, if you try to ignore those times where you spend those sleepless nights and not think through that to get makes it worse. I think the fact that I'll go through the drill like last night, which is the first time in a long time that I did. Um, I think part of it, cause I knew we, we'd probably be talking about it. I think it's healthy to do that for me at least it has been, you know, it's healthy for me to replay that and to understand. And, and you know you, you talked about that moment with my company commander at Fort Phillips. I remember that conversation. And I remember kind of going back at him a little bit and saying, you know, I just think if I would've done this or done that, and he stopped me. Brian, listen, you did everything right. You did everything that you could do out there. And it was, you know, it was definitely what I needed to hear because we still had a long way to go in that deployment and I still had to go do another one. It was, it was great leadership on his part because it gave me, there was no more second guessing at that point, you know, because it, that was not the time to sit there and start to question my decision and my instincts in battle that it served me. Well. Up until that point,

Speaker 1:          01:40:02       I had a, um, a similar conversation as a matter of fact with leaf. So, you know, when, when mark we got killed, it was a Ryan job who ended up dying as well, but he had been severely wounded and Lafe was down in a combat outpost with his platoon. And we got Ryan job had been Kaz evaced out and now the guys are down at this combat outpost and the army who are the one, three, seven, um, bulldogs Bravo company, who we had an amazing relationship with. Captain Mike Bama main gun. Mike, they were out trying to try to get after it and they got to a point where he said, hey, we think we know where these guys are that shot. Ryan, do you, can you guys help us? I mean, it was like the day of fighting and Lafe called me up on the, on the radio and says, Hey, w w w I want to go back out.

Speaker 1:          01:41:01       They think they know where these guys are. I want to go back out. And I was like, go, go get some. And he went out and you know, they were under heavy fire and that's what mark got killed. And you know, leaf was, you know, he, he was, you know, the mission gets done and all that. But next day leaf comes to me and he says, um, you know, hey, hey Jocko, him, you know, he was tore up, you know, he was tore up his, his, his friend, his brother was, was dead. His other friend was severely wounded. But what really got to him was mark because you know, he'd made this decision to go back out and he said to me, you know, I just don't know if I you, I don't know if I made the right decision. And I said to, I said to him, [inaudible] there was no decision to make. There was Americans out there fighting in the streets trying to get after these guys that had wounded one of your guys, one of our guys, and they thought they knew where he was and they thought you could go and get them.

Speaker 1:          01:42:08       There's no decision to make. You don't have to have a choice in that situation. You do what you do as an American, as a seal, as a frogman. There was no decision. You did what we do.

Speaker 1:          01:42:38       And I think that's something that any leader, when you get your young leaders out there, no, obviously if they screw something up, obviously that's a different story. But you know, we don't have the luxury of knowing what's going to happen in to combat situation. There's no crystal ball. There's no do you don't know. Like what you just said, guys would say that stuff to me sometimes. Like you could've gone left or right. Oh really? Cause if you could've gone left, like you just talked about and he had a giant ID and now everyone's dead, you could've gone straight and you could have gotten clear. You don't know. You don't have that luxury in combat. You're making decisions based on the information that you have at that time. You don't know all this other shit yet. If you knew it. Obviously looking back, hindsight is 2020 we wouldn't have even gone there in the first place. But we don't know that. The only way to avoid any risk is not to go, is not to do your job is to just go ahead and stand up, raise your hand and say I'm a coward. That's how you can avoid these situations.

Speaker 2:          01:43:38       But

Speaker 1:          01:43:39       guys in the Marine Corp guys in the seal teams, they don't raise their hand and say that they raised their hand and say, where's the bad guys? We're going to get them.

Speaker 2:          01:43:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:43:48       And one of the mistakes you can make too, is sometimes you want

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       to stop, you want to think about it. Sometimes there is no right answer right there. There's a bunch of things you can do. There's a bunch of options and whatever one you take and maintain tempo and achieved tempo and stay a step ahead of the enemy is the right one. It's how you execute it. Yeah. Either way you could be going into, into a bad day, but you better do it your way in on your terms. Yeah. One thing that's guaranteed to turn into a bad day is sitting there and not do nothing happens. Because I'll tell you what, if you're not maneuvering the enemy's maneuvers, we are. If you're not maneuvering the enemy's absolutely maneuvering. They're getting their flanking you, they're getting a high ground, they're doing something. So you better just be inaction, taking action, make a decision and go. Especially on their turf, their tour, their cities, their neighborhoods. They know every corner, we're guessing.

Speaker 2:          01:44:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:44:40       So now you come back, you, you, um, I'm fast forwarding to where you're now becoming a company XL. I'm going to the book. Just after we deployed again in 2006 I was pulled from weapons company to become an executive officer for India company. Three two marines. It happened so fast. I didn't have time to get know my new marines before we ended up in country again. We deployed to Al Anbar province to a fob near Haba Nia, and this was cool because you are in Habbaniyah and I was 20 miles away in Ramadi and in that summer of 2006

Speaker 2:          01:45:13       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:45:13       next, my company last four Marines killed.

Speaker 2:          01:45:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:45:17       Lance Corporal Don Champ Champlin was our first. He was killed by a roadside bomb on the main road running through our area. That was the end of August of 2006 a month later on the 24th our company commander sent a platoon out after an insurgent who'd fired a rocket into one of our patrol basis. They'd gone out without a special device that blocked incoming cell phone signals and prevented in surgeons from remotely detonating Ids. Sure enough, the platoon got hit with a bomb.

Speaker 2:          01:45:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:45:44       Blue Lance Corporal Renee Martinez, 70 meters into the air. He died instantly. That one really hurt. I'd been on the base at the time. I took great pride in going out on patrols, not to ride herd on the platoon commanders, but to be there as an additional asset and to share the risks with my marines.

Speaker 2:          01:46:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:46:06       This time I'd been tied up and couldn't get out there with the men.

Speaker 2:          01:46:09       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:46:10       When I heard what was happening, I grabbed a Humvee and race to the scene. We carried Renee back to the morgue inside. I stood next to him, held his hand and said my goodbyes.

Speaker 2:          01:46:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:46:23       I will carry the guilt of that day for the rest of my life.

Speaker 2:          01:46:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:46:28       I should have been out there with that platoon. We kept taking casualties that fall. Even units just passing through our area got hit. One EOD, Rick got hit with a roadside bomb build. The blast didn't destroy the armored Humvee. It set off a phosphorus based incendiary grenade grenades. The EOD team had left on the floor of their rig before we can even get to them. The white hot chemical fired melted them where they sat. The site was indescribable. After that scene, morale in the company plummeted. The men question the mission. What was the point? We were getting shot at almost every day. Going into he had a patrol was a daily nightmare of snipers, bombs and bushes. Half the time we couldn't even fire back. The rules of engagement were so strict that if civilians were in the area, we could not engage the enemy. Since there were almost always civilians in the area, our marines had to show incredible restraint even as they watched their brothers die.

Speaker 2:          01:47:38       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:47:38       so you guys were wrapped that Roe Roe was tight.

Speaker 3:          01:47:42       It was tough. I mean it was how many, it had never been patrolled before. They had set up patrol basis, but they had never gone out and walked around in in it. You know, the, the outgoing unit said, you don't want to do that. You don't want to do that, but you had to. The only way, the only way to defeat that enemy was to suffocate the area and what mattered. Most of the people, if the people trusted us, they would feed us the information. So we get captured the enemy if that people trusted them because we wouldn't patrol and we were scared, then they would trust them and we would end up, we would end up not accomplishing our mission. And it was, it was so hard.

Speaker 3:          01:48:19       You know, people have this idea that because you were a certain rank, everybody's going to listen or to hardcore leadership and in they're not going to ask questions. You know, when I would go patrol base to patrol base and speak to my men and they would ask, why, why should I walk out there tomorrow? You know, we don't have CNN and, and this general or the president talking to us, given us this big huge, hey, here's the ultimate game plan over. We don't get any of that. I mean, my guys were showering once every 1718 days. That's it. We were living amongst the populous amongst the enemy that was traveling all around the country, coming in and, and, and, and attacking us. And so it got really difficult. But the one thing that that stuck with them that they could understand that at their perspective they got was, hey, look, if you quit on me, that's one less guy to man the post on top of this patrol base to keep this roadway clear.

Speaker 3:          01:49:17       It's one less guy garden Mikey's flank. When you go on patrol and you got three patrols tomorrow, we were already so thin at that time. Our battlespace was way too big for us to truly suffocate it, to make sure the enemy couldn't, couldn't come in and influence way too big, but as we got better, as we secured the area and we focused really on the main supply route and the economic of that, the shops, if we get you secure, the shops insecure the schools because the kids couldn't go to school and the kid tried to go to school. I'll kind of killed the teachers. So now we secured the area enough that the two schools could open. When we were able to do that, then the shops opened up and the people could start living their lives again. That was one of the proudest days of my marines lives when those kids could walk to school again, these schools were corners blown up from iads bullet holes in him.

Speaker 3:          01:50:15       There were no roofs. I mean they were by our standards in America, you wouldn't be able to fathom what these look like. They were basically concrete squares with, with really bad desks in them. The school supplies they had were given to him from us. And so that was a huge win for us. And at that time was right around the same time of the search when the surge took place. What happened was two Iraqi companies pushed west and we're able to take up a quarter of our battlespace, which then greatly allowed us now. Now we've got enough people. Now we can really influence it. What happened with the Iraqi people who you would sit down and have dinner with them and bring them gifts and talk to him? I'd have meetings with them at two in the morning when they felt comfortable to speak to me. Now they're telling me who, where, what time, where can we get them?

Speaker 3:          01:51:07       And when you've got marines question the mission, then all of a sudden you deliver them some intelligence hae at 3:00 AM you're going to go find this person at this spot. This is what they look like, this what they're called, get them. Then they get excited, and I don't mean get him is in terms of, hey, they're going to go and they're going to go kill that person. They're going to go capture them. And we had a whole process. That whole very frustrating do you had to literally now, now my, my regional longer instrument. Now they're also detectives. All right, so this is the Intel package that led to this detention. Here's the paperwork for the detention, and we delivered them to the detention center. If you don't hit every wicked right, that person's back on the streets and three days. So that was also detailed discipline and doing all the right things. But they did it. And I tell Ya, Ramadi, Hibernia, they were some of the worst areas in Iraq that fall by Christmas time. It was amazing. The turnaround was incredible. They were quiet. They were quiet. It was, it was, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:52:07       I left the, I left October 21st, 2006 there was 30 to 50 enemy attacks a day while I was in deployment that six months, by January there was like one or two enemy attacks a day down from 30 to 50. It was boom. It was incredible, incredible and blog

Speaker 3:          01:52:25       than February, February of 2007 in it,

Speaker 1:          01:52:32       beacon to common home, third battalion, second marines came home in 2007 after suffering 15 killed in action. It could have been far worse for all of us if we hadn't seen any progress in hominy. And that's what you're talking then all those questions we had over the mission and its value would have returned home to term torment us for years to come. In fact, we did see progress and that made it a little easier to accept things.

Speaker 6:          01:52:59       And um,

Speaker 1:          01:53:02       yeah, that's, that's basically what you just said and that's why, you know, you and I were talking about this on the way over as, as nice as it was that we got to see that happen. There was nothing more sickening to me than to have eight years later have the, the black flag of isis flying over the city of Ramadi at the government center. That debt, it was just absolutely heinous to see that it didn't need to happen. And

Speaker 6:          01:53:30       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:53:31       You know, they actually took Ramadi back again through massive air strike and I was talking to one of my buddies that was a j Tac that's actually coming on the podcast Marine Corps, Jay Tac then I was talking to you about earlier, but he's, I was like, how many bombs did we drop in Ramadi while we were there? Because it was a populous city. There was normal Iraqis that want to live their lives. We weren't dropping moms. He was like, I don't know, maybe a dozen, 15 in the second portion to Ramadi that the Iraqis just did behind the strength of American firepower. You know how many air missions they did? They did 600 strike missions. And you've seen pictures of Ramadi right now it's rubble now. They're rebuilding it now, but it was just, just, just rubble and um, yeah, just, it's so disheartening. Um, so you come home from that deployment and pretty quickly after you got, you got home that Travis got killed.

Speaker 1:          01:54:31       Yeah. And, uh, you know, I wanted to give a little credit here to the Mitt teams because Travis was a Mitt team, uh, which is military transition team, which was, okay. So I talk about this sometimes, right? So the seals and a special operations guys, a lot of times we live in relative comfort. Okay. So we live like, okay, we're pretty comfortable. You know, like I said, I had Max on deployment, I brought a GP medium tent to put massive, cause I got to train some Jujitsu. We have a nice weight room, you know, wheat and seals are super aggressive and crafty and figuring out like, okay, what can we do? How can we get this? We'll Barb contractors and ordering stuff. And so we just make, we do a good job of building our infrastructure. And when I say infrastructure, I mean some, some comforts come with that.

Speaker 1:          01:55:15       Right now you go to the conventionals, take a step down because they're not getting as much leeway. They don't have as much. Uh, they can't get away with as much, so they're living maybe a little bit harder, maybe even a lot harder then. And of course a, by the way, there's special operations guys that are living out in the sticks and Afghanistan with two of them with, you know, 280 tribesmen. So I'm, I'm saying, I'm talking about my particular situation, which my particular situation was in Iraq when I deployed there. We always lived, always lived good conventionals we'd go out to their outstations, we'd stopped on a way to a mission. We'd stopped by someone, you know, stop by wherever, some cops somewhere or some fobs somewhere. Those guys are living rough. And I had seals, my seals that lived in Craig it or they were living rough.

Speaker 1:          01:55:59       But my point is you go one step further and now you get to what called the Mitt team. And the mid teams are embedded with Iraqi troops. And so they are living with Iraqi troops. There might be two, three, maybe four of them. And they're out there living with the Iraqi troops, counting on the security of the Iraqi forces to protect them. And I mean it was horrible. When we first got to Ramadi, there was a, there was a VB IED attack that killed the oncoming Mitt team commander and the outgoing Mitt team commander, they're doing a turnover at a station and a Vb IED came, killed them both wounded a bunch. But it's interesting cause I didn't know Travis was a supply officer in the Marine Corps. And so, so the, the Marine Corps has this way of selecting where you, where you get what you get to be in the Marine Corps as an officer.

Speaker 1:          01:56:53       They take the class and chunk it up into thirds and then the, the each top third you get a pick and it goes down the list. So that way they don't have every single guy, eh, all the best guys, quote unquote going to be Marine Corps and three are going to be a pilot. You might be, you might be the bottom, the top of the bottom third in the class and you get your pick. So you don't, it doesn't matter how you perform. I mean it matters. But out of a class of over 200 Travis was 17 in his class at the basic school, which is a very prestigious, they'd be due to graduate in the top 25 is incredible. And he got his third choice is 30 is a logistics officer. He was furious. So he's angry. And then the, and the Marine Corps did this very, very well.

Speaker 1:          01:57:37       They understood the importance of the Mitt team. So they really took great guys and send him to the Mitt teams and he, so they put up volunteers, hey, who wants, who wants to raise your hand and go live amongst the Iraqi's counting on them for security training them, working with them, eating their crappy food, living without air condition mean. It just sucks. It just sucks. It's awful. Of course. What does Travis to, Oh, I'm game. Let's do this. So he went and uh, obviously he was, he was, he was killed in action. He was killed in action during a firefight trying to, like you just talked about, wasn't trying to save other marines. He was trying to save his fellow Iraqi soldiers. And just like you just said, there's so many people that don't understand how closely we worked with Iraqi soldiers and how committed we were with helping them. So that's a classic example. And by the way, that that eulogy that he wrote for himself was this Travis Mannion was a man on afraid to stand for what was right. I think that's something that anybody could aspire towards. And, and actually another, you know, you talked about the connections earlier. Well there's a connection here that Travis, his roommate in the Naval Academy, it was a guy by the name of Brendan Looney who did what you talked about the painful way of getting to the seal teams. He went to the surface warfare community. Then he got picked up for the seal teams, went through seal training and he was also killed in Afghanistan 21 September, 2010

Speaker 4:          01:59:35       yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:59:37       But you come home from that deployment and now you've got, you're married, you got one daughter, you're expecting another daughter. And by the way, this whole time, like we talked about earlier, you've been fighting MMA training. You fought, your first pro fight was between deployments and you're amateur fights we're going to talk about was before your first deployment and you make a decision that all right, you're gonna get out of the Marine Corps. And obviously this is probably the hardest decision you've ever had to make it year at that point, your roto brutal,

Speaker 4:          02:00:11       but

Speaker 1:          02:00:13       it's 2007. How much are you, were you, were you thinking at that time like a, I'm going to go for this MMA thing and it's gonna it's gonna be, I got a shot at making it,

Speaker 3:          02:00:22       you know, it was, it was, I knew I had a shot at you must have, you had a shock cause your ass was undefeated at this point. Of course, the worst thing that could have happened, right? I mean, the worst thing I'm training with, so I would basically go around the base and I found this corpsman with cauliflower ear. Hey, how'd you get that? Koffler uh, champ at an Oklahoma wrestling in high school. Boom, be here 1800 every night. Got It all, bring you gear. Cool. He was in and he then started training with a started fighting. But I got a wrestler dude right now they're cuter, wrestled. Hey you do, you're a blue belt in Jiu Jitsu. You're my instructor master. But he was my master. I had no striking coach. We had no pad work, no nothing. It was me and a couple of marines plus a corpsman and we would get after every day.

Speaker 3:          02:01:14       And then every time we fought we won. So we thought we really knew what we were doing. And I would take leave every once in a while I take leave and I would go to extreme couture for a couple of days and get destroyed. I went out to Temecula, to Dan Henderson's place, I'd go get destroyed and I just try and learn to moves. Right. Give me two moves. So here I am in the WC again. Armbars from the mount arm bar from the guard dose. I know it. Half Guard is now, can't sweep a soul from it though. What Mola Wall showed me how to defend a single leg and double leg when I was out of Temecula. So now I got that down pat and I still got a mean jab cross away we go baby and I'm winning fights with these things and you know I would end up losing the first time it WC and that would prompt me to to leave Georgia, go find somewhere to train and I'll never forget my first training session at at Jackson Winklejohn Academy and I'm there training and Greg Jackson comes walking up to me after my first practice and this is as polite as he could try to cop.

Speaker 3:          02:02:20       Let me at the time Brian, I am so amazed at how far you've gone with how little information you've been given a code word. Wow, you suck. How the Hell did you win?

Speaker 3:          02:02:36       One of the things I explained, I said, look, when you only know so much you can fight 150 miles an hour cause you're not thinking. Then all of a sudden I'm learning all these new techniques. Then I started thinking I had an up and down period there where win some lose some. And I got to a point where after the Phil Davis fight, Hey, you may be out of here. You know the UFC wasn't a huge fan of me. They didn't really care. They didn't, you know, Joseph wasn't a huge fan of these WVC guys that were forced upon them. That wasn't a talent. He went and found it and I told him I'd fought three times inside of six months and I said, look, I need a break. And, and I literally looked at my MMA training like you would look at the training of a marine company.

Speaker 3:          02:03:18       Where am I weak? How much time do I have? What am I going to schedule? What am I going to do? Who Do, who are the experts I can go to to get better in all these areas? And I approached it. I I knew at that point, hey look, I still had a fulltime job. I never fought without one transition to the marine corps, started working at a company called Med assets. Med assets had this, this project, this thing, hey hire heroes when to help vets get jobs will maybe you could lead that took that over. So I'm working every day but at the same time, you know, I started this thing in MMA and I can't go out like this to many people said I was going to wash out, that I was going to be exposed, couldn't do it. No Way. There were too many marines at the time.

Speaker 3:          02:03:59       Taking pride in my performance is in there and although I was older, yeah, I'm 20 probably 29 at that time. So in terms of MMA age, I'm already, I'm green and I'm already kind of getting a little old, but I started to find a way starting to figure it out and, and, and not cutting any corners like other fighters were at the time, but starting to figure it out. And it all just came down to discipline where a lot of martial artists don't want to spend time, they don't want to spend 30 minutes drilling one move and understanding how they could use that move from various positions and why it works. And how it plays into my style of fighting, why it will effective. They want to drill that one move, they want to do it five times and then they want to go live.

Speaker 3:          02:04:43       Let's go live, let's go live. And I had alerted that point if I'm going to catch up with these fighters who are younger in many cases, but much more experienced than me. I have got, I've got to take an analytical approach and an honest approach to my skillset and start to shore up some holes or else I'm going to continue to lose practice. Just wrestling like crazy. And then submission avoidance. It was, it was, I actually went and put a g on for the first time ever. It was working some basics because everybody wanted to hold me down. If I could get out from underneath somebody with a Guianan, it's gonna be a heck of a lot easier. Gnocchi, truth, I was bringing in wrestlers that were way above my level. A guy named Harry Lester, who was, you know, in the Olympian was coming in and throwing me all over the place.

Speaker 3:          02:05:29       And so I was training, wrestling nonstop and then I would go and I'd go to Albuquerque. I didn't have a fight coming up, but I would go live in Albuquerque for two weeks at a time away from my family and help other guys and their training camps and get exposed in drill and without, here's the other big part was guys like Rashad Evans, Keith, your dean, Joey via Senor, Nate Marquardt. Without those guys, it would've never happened because after they would beat me after they would pass my guard, take me down, hit me with this combination, they would stop afterwards and tell me how and why, and so I learned at a much faster rate than your typical fighter would because not only am I, I'm drilling with some of the best in the world, taking the time to drill and take an analytical approach, hey, I know we're going to work this today, coach, but my butterfly guard is completely ineffective and I'd love to work at specifically not just on sweeping because I don't think I'm going to get there yet against my level of competition.

Speaker 3:          02:06:22       Just get up. I'd love to use it to get up or even just get to the fence where now I've got a third leg that I could utilize to get back up until we would drill specifics like that. And I've got these guys who have 30 plus fights who are champions now taking the time to help me, which meant a lot to me. I'll never forget it. I mean they were as much coaches to me as Mike Winkeljohn and Greg Jackson where you know, and then you know, obviously on top of you could do all of that. The other piece of it was when I would do my camps there, when I really got where I was at my best, you know, when I be Chris leave binge or Santiago, let's just go. When I was beating those guys mentally, I was in the best place. My family was in it when it was in a great spot.

Speaker 3:          02:07:06       They were, my wife and kids were very supportive of me leaving and doing my camps in Albuquerque and my time away from them. It made me nasty. They'd come visit. But man, I would literally look at my opponent like, you're the one who kept me away from my family this long, you're going to pay for it. And, and it was, it was a strong motivator. And that if you're in a place to fight or where you're not hungry, getting new information, being able to mentally be in the right place for you to perform. This is not about who the better fighter is. It has nothing to do it. It's about who fights best that night. And if you can't mentally be in the state where you're going to fight best that night, you got a problem and you're in the wrong place. And that, that, that phase of my career, that's when I was, I was there, I was able to do that.

Speaker 3:          02:07:52       And that was, that was when I was at my best. For sure. You, I mean you had some stunning fights. I know. I always tell, you know, sometime my fighters will say all, you know, I'm not, I'm not feeling it tonight. It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter you like this isn't training. I'll say, look, it doesn't matter how you feel tonight cause a fight night comes, you might be feeling good, bad, doesn't matter. What you have to do is perform right now. That's what you gotta do. So train yourself to perform right now. But yeah, you had some, uh, you had some great fights. Um, and Chris Liebing who I know trained with Chris, great guy and that, and he's such a tough bastard and you guys threw down. Yeah, we knew, we knew neither one of us are going to be that hard to hit. Um, but uh, no tons of respect for that guy.

Speaker 3:          02:08:38       And that was a fight he didn't have to take, you know, I saw an opening there where there was a window and, and he made just take me as a, as a fight to, okay, let me go get a win, get some money and, and go on. Cause he had just come off two huge wins and like a week or 10 days, no psycho and so of them, phenomenal guy in this sport. And Yeah. You know, it was a wild ride. I, and when I look back on it, there's, there's definitely some regrets. Like anybody there, there's some things you wish you wish you could have done. Um, some things that happened familywise that certainly stalled and in, in helped aid the decision to stop, you know, my wife losing, losing her little brother to suicide was a really tough thing. Her mom was living with us at the time, so you know, us going through that tragedy together.

Speaker 3:          02:09:23       It's hard. We were human beings and a lot of fighters have to deal with tragedy and compete. This is what we do for living. We've got to fight through it. It's a hard thing when I look back on it where I know I was as an athlete and as a mixed martial arts, how green I was to have come that far and been a legitimate top 10 middleweight at that time. I'm proud of that, especially here, especially in the era when I fought were there were some extra curricular activities going on as well. I'm against guys that were a lot of guys we're on, we're on steroids. There was no testing or there was really limited tests. It was an Iq test, right? If you fail that you, you know, you're just, you're just straight up dumb. Uh, but it was fun and I mean the guys you like, you lost a Chail Sona, right?

Speaker 3:          02:10:06       Who was two minutes from being the, the, the middle weight champion of the world against Anderson Silva. Uh, you know, you, you lost to him, you beat Sacara. Then you lost a Biz Bang. Who actually is the current middle weight champion. So, and the guys that beat you were bad asses. Yeah, absolutely. And you were a guy that will like started fighting three weeks ago. You know, that's just awesome, man. It's a testament that, you know, the coolest part about it was, was during that time, you know, in any kind of happened subtly beneath that, you know, at least to the fight fans was, was taken that that little hire heroes USA project that that company Med assets asked me to watch over, right? Step one was, we're starting to build some programs. Step two was getting one of my best friends in the world who served with me, who is right next to that track as it burned Nate Smith to come and be my chief operating officer and build this amazing team and leveraging some of the media attention I got for fighting.

Speaker 3:          02:11:06       Leveraging it for our cause in building it and, and not just building a company where, hey, we went out, we fundraise for a mission. No, that's bogus. We were out there accomplishing the mission, helping veterans get legitimate jobs, careers so that they can succeed and lead again back here home and in their communities and watching it grow from a team of five to a team of 10 to a team of 22 are now we've got 96 full time employees and we're, we're bringing in over 300 veterans and spouses a week into the programs and that that was all built with this amazing team of people. While I was still fighting that that was my full time job doing that and in having a board of directors that had the foresight and and the perspective to say, Hey, you know what? Yes, you're going to be a little limited during some of these training camps.

Speaker 3:          02:12:00       Bought what you're able to bring to our brand is helpful right now in the phase at this company is and, and it's been a wild and really amazing ride. And in some of the things we talked about earlier where you have these things, these questions that will always haunt you about the loss of your friends, the last few marines, the loss of your seals. When you can lead an initiative like that, it helps you feel like, hey, you know what I am. I am taking advantage of every day, every day we're moving forward, we're achieving, we're helping other warriors now find success post military service and, and that's me earning it, earning my day where they don't. They no longer have any, you know, Travis may need to live anymore and his family would give anything to see him one more time. I can't bring him back, but I'll tell you what, if I sat here crying about it, feeling sorry for myself, that my friend Travis was gone, he'd be the first a slap the hell out of me when I die for, or at least do double leg on your ass.

Speaker 3:          02:13:00       He was, I'm telling you me and that, that was he planned on fighting when he got done with that women, he'd still be fighting to this day. He was a bad, bad dude. And that was your, your last fight in the UFC. You retired after you fought Vandelay Silva, which did you plan no to do that? So you don't know that aren't MMA? There's a guy, a legendary mixed martial artists named Vandelay Silva. I saw him fight a few times and we're in Japan back in the back in the day and he's a, he's a brawler and he's incredible punching power. And his nickname is the ax murderer because he looks like a psycho. And uh, anyways, Brian had a fight with him and these two guys went in there. It was like Russian roulette.

Speaker 3:          02:13:52       It was a street fight. And eventually you got caught, you know, got caught by one of the best strikers that have ever been in the game. And um, and that, and by the way, you dropped him a couple times. You, you had that, you didn't have it one, but you definitely, you dropped him two or three times in the first round or twice the first one back from the dead, a minimum of two times. The eyes were in the back of his head. And then he just, he looked at me again with bloodshot eyes. It was, it was unbelievable. Unbelievable. But no, that was not the plan. And so you with Greg Jackson, wink, right? Ah, I wasn't ISO for the, the other Sacara Bisbing and Vandelay fight. I trained myself. And the reason being was, uh, right after I had fought shell son in two days before Christmas, me and my wife land in baggage claim and I get a call and in her little brother who had struggled with bipolar disorder and depression, and we didn't know that debt, right?

Speaker 3:          02:14:52       He had taken his own life, went up to a cabin, middle of the woods and taken his own life, had to tell my wife there in baggage claim and her mom at the time was living with us. It was personal life was a mess. Still got to pay bills though, right? You still, it's still got a company to run. So I gotta fight career that I've got to push through and I can't just, hey look, I'm going to take seven months off here to get through this because I got bills to pay anyways. It, it caused me to start my own camps so that the game plan going in was, hey, we're going to, we're going to take Vandelay down a little bit in this fight and disrupt him. Really, really confused them because nobody's, nobody's used to me doing that. And so I fly to Japan, we get off the plaintiff that long flight after a long training camp where I absolutely overtrained and we get to the hotel and, and, and me and one of my striking coaches Mizuna tall, we go start hitting pads, we're hitting pads and pad works done it.

Speaker 3:          02:15:43       Oh Man. All of a sudden I start to cool down. I can't lift my knee up on my left leg, tear something in my head. And it happens, right? I mean, evangelist could have walked in there and how many miles he could've walked into a couple of injuries. So anyways, now this gets into my head a little bit. And so I asked to see the UFC doctor and so he, as soon as he landed, he was told, hey, you got to go see Brian Stan. I say, look, I've looked at all this stuff. Nova Cain is legal. I just want to get novacane for fight night. So I won't feel it. And I'm walking around the hotel and I'm trying not to show anybody that I'm limping at the press conference cause I have a legitimate limp. And anyways, he's like, okay, we should be, we're in Japan, we're not in a second or third world country.

Speaker 3:          02:16:24       We're in Tokyo. Right. I could have walked across the street, probably got in late. It can't anyways supposed to get, it's supposed to get us, but I'm going to get it on me to get them to get it doesn't get it. When you find Japan the fight so that they could cater the American TV audience, you leave at like 7:00 AM. So he's sitting there, sorry. So I let that affect me too much mentally and, and we're trying to warm up backstage and I'm trying to shoot some double legs and I'm not feeling it. And in my own head rate for a walk, I'm like, you know, up the student, get some miles on him. I hit like a truck. Let's get in there. Let's knock this dude out and let's get this fight over with. So ready to go walk out there. And he tags me first, hits me behind the ear and, and you know most of vandelays fights, he's a little bit more of an accumulation guy.

Speaker 3:          02:17:09       He's not considered a one punch knockout guy. This one right hand he hits me with, I had never been rocked in the AUC gum before in my life and he dropped me. I was like, all right, it's on, let's go. And so then I rock him and once I rocked him they thought, okay, one more good shot on the chin and he's done. And I landed it and he'd go down and then he'd come back and the wait a minute here. And so I'm just caught up. And so the second round I start to get a little more technical and move around a little bit. Like, all right, he's obviously not going away. I've got to take a different approach. Well, I don't know what this guy has made of. And, and then he, I didn't even, I don't remember her, you know, I get caught with that huge punch, don't remember any of it.

Speaker 3:          02:17:49       And it's crazy. But I realized I lost, I came to, as Jon Anik, who's one of my closest friends now comes up to the microphone and I realized, well, I don't remember women. So why most losses. And it was a horrible flight home. I'm sitting there flying home and I had a jack and coke in my hand, couldn't sleep at all, didn't sleep, and I am miserable. I lost to a guy who was supposed to beat, who was supposed to be washed up, you know, I had pretty much made the decision then you know, I'm, I'm, I'm out. It's over. If you're not going to get busy being the champion, then there's other areas where that need my attention more from my family to the company I'm trying to run and it was a hard decision and in, pardon me when I made the decision thought for sure. I'm definitely in a comeback, right? I'm, I'm going to come back in for like two years. I held onto that and had to fight against it. Like, no, it is not your best interest to come back anymore. You do a better job talking about in the microphone. Then you're going to do strap and the gloves on any more pal. You're 35 now. I'm 36 it's over. That makes me feel real good over here.

Speaker 3:          02:18:59       So you know, we've been going for a while. Tell us about like specifically with with hire heroes, what, how can people support that? Where do we look for it? All that stuff so that way people have information on it. Yes, we've got a website, hire heroes usa.org and if you are a service member or a spouse who needs help finding a career, if you're unemployed or underemployed, you go on there your register and we'll get you your personal veteran transition specialist. Fancy term for a job coach. And we'll take you through the whole thing from revising your resume, uh, to teach you how to effectively do a job search, how to interview for a job. We will help you if not build your linkedin site for you. Teach you how to use that to impact and expand your network. Do social media audits. Hey, what pictures and posts as you not have up on Facebook right now, you know, take a look.

Speaker 3:          02:19:48       Hey, no big papa pump at Yahoo is not your email anymore. It's going to be christinaSmith@yahoo.com are all the do's or don'ts. But then we have a job or a lot of corporate partners. We'll match you to all those companies, but we do so people, if people want to hire a veteran they can absolutely you as well as, that's the one thing I get hit with a lot is you know people say, how can we help veterans? And I say hire veterans and they say, where do we find him? So now we've got to put good place to find a solution. Women, we're bringing in over 300 people a week in the program who are all going to get one on one assistance and and different from any other nonprofit. Everything we do is tracked, logged and analyze and salesforce so that we can hold ourselves accountable.

Speaker 3:          02:20:28       I can hold every one of my employees accountable for the workload they have. They all have weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual metrics that they have to hit. They don't hit them, they no longer work. Here we run this non profit like a business because people donate money to us to help veterans find careers, period. And if we're not doing that, then we go away. And I take that very serious and it's what's allowed us to grow from a team of four to now a team of 96 it will continue to do so. And my main mission now is to make sure hire heroes USA is there for the next generation of combat veterans as well when they return home to a society that doesn't understand them as much and in the real help, the real need is for the veteran to learn how to communicate their skill set, how to deliver their value proposition.

Speaker 3:          02:21:13       It's a hard thing to do. Think about your seals when they got out, if they went to a job to try to write a resume, what the hell do I put my first resume looked like I was trying to get a job as a mercenary. It was all and I was a Naval Academy Grad. Imagine these young sailors, you know, and, and over 80% of the people we help at hire heroes or your young enlisted service members, the ones who need us the most. Awesome. Awesome. And then you've got the Guardian project going on. Incredible project. And I'd love to to, to get these guys down. Ben Kovacs who's our executive director come down and be on your show some day. It's, it's so in line with some of your beliefs on martial arts in Jujitsu. Ben Has a vision that every kid should have the opportunity to train martial arts, every child check and, and so he went out network and found a man by the name of Joel on unfelt who's on my board at hire heroes who's an executive at Twitter and they bought a property in Oakland where there are a lot of young men and women who don't have much going on after school and they don't, they, that the chips are stacked against them.

Speaker 3:          02:22:15       Yeah, there's not a whole lot that they have, you know, their, their families have a hard time making money and there's a lot of trouble they can get into and they will find them and they bring them in and they come, they train martial arts, they trained Jujitsu, they trained boxing, they do their homework. Then they've networked with local restaurants and they get a healthy meal afterwards for free. In many cases, these are, this is the health, the only healthy meal that that young man or woman's going to get that day. They have regular members to the gym, but those members pay a membership fee. That also then pays for those young kids so that they can come for free. People buy a gift for themselves. Then they get a freaky for one of the kids. I've gone there and talk and ransom classes and it is just, it's incredible to meet these young men and women who haven't been given much in life.

Speaker 3:          02:22:59       Their parents are grateful because now they're not paying for after school care. They can't afford it anyways, and their kids not wandering the streets, but now they've got this place to go to where there's likeminded people pushing them to do better. Don't allow your circumstances to direct and direct your life until you who you're going to be. Nothing should hold you back. So the discipline that they're learning now, the camaraderie, that character they're learning at Guardian is starting to spill into the other aspects of their life. Their grades are going up, they're being more nutritious, they're focused on their future. Hey, wait a minute, college, I can go. I can go to college. They've got these great positive inspirations around him and the goal is to take guardian from Oakland and start to to to brand it and get it in gyms across the country where now we don't need a physical facility to do it in.

Speaker 3:          02:23:47       Other gyms can take on the program where now we've got a system where they can adopt it and people can pay their membership as part of a way of paying the membership to these underprivileged kids to go there and train afterschool as well so that they can have a chance. Just because they're poor doesn't mean they should get the opportunity to train Jujitsu, to train boxing, to get all the character development that goes along with martial arts. That's all I got. I actually, I got another book coming out in the book is called the way of the war, your kid and it's a kid's book and it's basically about a young kid who's getting picked on at school. He can't do any pull ups. He, he doesn't know his times tables and is basically miserable, right. And anyways, school ends and his uncle Jake comes out to stay with them for the summer.

Speaker 3:          02:24:33       Uncle Jack as a team guy. So uncle Jake says, oh, you got some issues. What are the issues? Oh, I can't do pull. He goes, I, we can fix all those things. So one of the, you know, obviously get some working out. Oh, you're getting bullied because he's getting bullied badly. Well guess where he's going to learn? He's going to learn Jujitsu. So I honestly think there's going to be a little bit of a surge of Jujitsu in America. I love it. And it sounds like this is right up there, right up that alley. It is. You know, when, when that comes out, we're going to grab a bunch of them, make it mandatory for these kids, things like that. Inspire them. I mean, they make a difference when you look at the just the social and economic impact, young man or woman who has a high likelihood of probably getting arrested, especially when you look at some of the problems we have with our criminal justice system right now.

Speaker 3:          02:25:18       Instead they have a positive environment and never get, they go into college and they go get a great job and they're contributing. They're winning now. Huge impact for our country, for our communities to do that and and to get more Jujitsu, more martial arts and some of these, these poor super rural areas in our country where there's extreme poverty and are super urban areas where there's extreme poverty where these young men and women don't get that opportunity because their parents can't pay $150 a month for them to go and they don't have any positive influences in their life. I mean at that, if that can fix a lot of problems that we have going on in our country, there's no doubt does. Is there a way to help the Guardian project right now? Go to go to guardian project.org there's a website right there. You can become a monthly sponsor.

Speaker 3:          02:26:01       I mean, that organization is, is, is in startup phase. If someone could give five the $10 a month to them, that is a huge portion of a young man or woman's monthly membership for them to go to that gym, get a free meal, have someone looking at the report card, tutoring them in math, teaching them Jujitsu. Confidence mean that we get young ladies in there and they're in their, their confidence when they start dating and who they choose and how, I mean the way they're going to approach life, these young men and understanding how to respect and train with the young lady, Hey, I'm going to grapple with you this round and how to respect you all. I mean it's, it's amazing to watch it's happening at a young age and how quickly they're developing. It's awesome. That's awesome. So hire heroes, the Guardian project organizations to support, and I guess that kind of wraps it with us.

Speaker 3:          02:26:58       If anybody wanted to support this podcast. Echo Charles, I have a question. Oh, echo comes with a deep question. Got a question kind of deep. So when you watch a few good men, are you like on the side of the Marines? Like the whole movie? I'm saying don't group me with them just because I wear the same uniform. You know a few good men, he's going against the navy. Tom Cruise, the navy guy. Dude, you're not going to seal. But you know, so I am. When I watch a few good men, I am with the marines all the way up until they break their integrity. All right, which it's a movie, right? But, but under no circumstances should we break our integrity and and that that's a problem. They, you know, that's, it's so false. No, colonel would tell someone one thing, then tell this junior guy over here, no, you go do this and then lie about and try and cover it up.

Speaker 3:          02:27:46       Cover a good cover up number when they break their integrity. That's, I don't, I don't care what uniform you're wearing, that that's a problem. Or if you're not wearing a uniform at all after we just talked about that on the last podcast. Maintain the integrity. It's true. Oh, follow up question. Is there such thing as a code red? No. Okay. There's no sense anyway. So support, right. We can talk about that if it was like cool. Yeah, let's do it right now. All right, well, uh, and let's do it fast. We'll will speed it up here. This top about on it supplements I worked out today because he probably can

Speaker 6:          02:28:22       tell. Yeah, you look, the pump is on it. It's there. So on. Um, the name of the preworkout is total strength and performance. I left out the strength in there, so you perform good and is strong anyway. If you want 10% off on it stuff. Shroom tech, Alpha brain total strengthen performance. Good on at.com/jocko Krill oil threatened me with a Krill oil rage today. Yeah, it's cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's another story right there. Anyway, on a dotcom slash chocolate, that's for 10% off best supplements in the world. Approved, approved, approved home. Um, also if you shop at Amazon by duct tape, whatever, um, or the books really we talk about, um, hard for the fight. You better order this one quick because I don't think it's in print right now. And my mom bought off five copies. My mother bought, I can't believe you've got one.

And you know, there's some shirts on there, you know, if you want to kind of get after it that way, get yourself a shirt that's kind of, you know, you're wearing shirts anyway, I figure, right? Yeah. Why not wear a Choco shirts anyways. Right, exactly

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       right. I agree with you make of that and they're good. That we kind of wait is this has to be one discipline equals freedom. Yeah. Discipline equals e.

Like if you're going to do that, don't wake up at 10 30 in the morning and roll out of bed on a city. No, no, no. Go accomplish something.

Speaker 6:          02:31:49       Yup. Very well put. Yes. Um, so yeah, check out those shirts. I'm not saying buy a shirt, I'm just saying I'm not sitting here and saying buy a shirt. I'm saying go ahead. Go on the website, junk store.com. Look at the shirts. If you like the shirts and you want to support the podcast, get a shirt, it's on you. Um, there's some rash guards in there so you can, you know, some, some physical activity, grappling, surfing, crop, anything that, you know, eating thing that you do a lot of physical activity in the range of motion. Rash guards, good hoodies, good patches, good regulation size or not regulations up. Good. All good. Anyway,

Speaker 3:          02:32:27       what about these mugs, these mugs better beyond there? Oh yeah, the mugs, unfortunately. Uh, I got a bunch of them made and we sold them on Amazon and we had a bunch in stock and then Joe Rogan posted a picture of his and then they were all gone. Then they're out of stock. I got more common, got more kind, a matte black early March. I think I tweeted out before we started the show, just, just showed the desk with all the weapons on it, the amount of testosterone and jawline in here, national capacity. There's 30 feet and Jawline, this office right now. Uh, yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:33:05       But yeah, those, I think what March, right too. It was like, I think early March. I think that will be available for something like that and still working on the international for the mugs. Right? Probably. So, hey, we're going to make that happen. So I'm stand by it for that. Also, k psychological warfare, I like to feel, sometimes I don't need to sit anymore, I'm over it. But if you do need psychological warfare can't, here's what it is. You ever have those days where you're like, you're about to work out or you have planned to work up and you're like, you know, maybe I'll just work out tomorrow. Everybody has the absolutely right. Yes. So what you do is you get this album that we put together, well, it's chocolate talking. I just kind of recorded it. But like I said, echo press record better than anybody else. But it's true. But it on iTunes you can get like a track. Like if your thing is like I eat donuts way too much and you're like, I'm going to fight the donuts or whatever, you can just get that track. It's called what? Sugarcoated lies. That's for example,

Speaker 3:          02:34:06       Jockos voice telling you why not to eat the donut. I love this. Essentially you don't need to, your voice is so stern and intense. It curse. It mattered. Absolutely right.

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       Yeah. It's like Batman. Yeah, right. No, I shouldn't Bale Batman personally. Don't eat the donut. That's more leaf leis is Batman horse. You're kind of like, oh no, I'm working joke Joe something. I Dunno. Either way. There's a bunch of them though. It's cool. Like Ted, wake up in the morning. What? Anyway, it's good man. It helps. It helps a lot. I very well received. I think so. Yeah. I was kind of surprised that go thought it was a good idea and oh man, people need this. I'm like, people need two minutes of me talking about don't I need it to go work out and send me in. Like there's no way I can sleep through cause we want them. The first track is called wake up and get after it because I think that really one of the easiest ways to start developing discipline in your life is to wake up early in the morning. So the first track is wake up and get after it and actually do it a count to 10 and give you the opportunity 10 seconds fair. And to get out of bed if not out of bed. By then we've got issues.

Speaker 1:          02:35:17       Crazy. It's, it's, it's, it's fun. Uh, anything else along with that? If you want to get some Jocko white tea. Yeah, it's available. It's available and in stock on Amazon. And you know, before I was hesitant because at one time I said, hey, we'll never sell out of it again. And everybody that listened as podcast bought it that day and we sold out in 15 minutes cause we sold out the first time and they're like, no, I'm just gonna get a ton. I said, don't worry, guys will never saw it again. Yeah, we sold out again. Now I'm feeling pretty confident that we won't sell it again. If that means I went kind of Richter, I over engineered the whole thing so we shouldn't sell out of Jocko white tea again. You can get it on amazon.com international orders. Check Ebay.

I warn you that when the video comes out it's gonna sell out because Echo Charles makes these videos so persuasive that everyone's going to come and while you're waiting for the monster, you can still carry on this conversation with us on the interwebs.
