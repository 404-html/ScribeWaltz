Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number one 15 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening.

Speaker 2:          00:00:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:12       War is different for everyone who experiences it.

Speaker 2:          00:00:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:19       On one end of the spectrum, there are some people who deployed to a safe area and protected by concrete and steel and Barb wire and their job, which is definitely an important part of the machine, but it just doesn't require them to be put into direct combat. And then with a little luck because of that situation, they can easily complete a wartime deployment with little or no contact with the enemy whatsoever. But they did their part and we are thankful for that. On the other end of the spectrum, there are some people that end up in anything but a safe area. They end up in the belly of the beast. They are called on to do more than is required and much more than could be expected. And that situation also creates a spectrum.

Speaker 2:          00:01:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:38       Some men find it to be too much.

Speaker 2:          00:01:44       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:44       And instincts of self preservation takeover and they go into survival mode and they cower and they hide and they'd give up and they wait.

Speaker 2:          00:01:57       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       For the inevitable. But others do what they can. They try to do their duty. They put one foot in front of the other and they reload their weapon and they try to keep firing. That's the middle of the spectrum. And then at the far end of the spectrum, there are those men that step up and go forward across the threshold, really across the threshold of life. And they go into the fire and into the flame and toward the unknown and toward death. Not to save themselves.

Speaker 2:          00:02:51       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:52       But they disregard their own safety and their own life to save they're friends.

Speaker 2:          00:03:01       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:01       They're brothers.

Speaker 2:          00:03:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:05       And their comrades in arms. And then beyond even that,

Speaker 2:          00:03:13       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:03:15       almost off the spectrum.

Speaker 2:          00:03:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:20       There are those men that take that step across the threshold of life and death over and over and over again. Not because they were ordered to, not for a metal, not because of some manufactured set of ideals, but simply because that is who

Speaker 2:          00:03:38       okay

Speaker 1:          00:03:39       they are. And I'm honored to have one of those men here with me today.

Speaker 3:          00:03:50       A son, a father,

Speaker 1:          00:03:54       and American. Oh, United States marine,

Speaker 3:          00:04:02       a man by the name of Mr Dakota Meyer. Dakota, welcome to the podcast and thank you for coming on. No, thank you so much for having me. I'm telling you, I'm honored. I'm honored. All right. As we normally do, let's start from where you started. Tell us a little bit about, about Columbia, Kentucky. Yeah. You know, it's, um, it's a small town. You know, I grew up in Columbia, Kentucky. Um, you know, I grew up in that first half of my life with my mother and, uh, ended up going and living with my father and um, you know, I didn't, didn't come from money. You didn't come from anything nice. You know, I ended up losing my father. I'm adopted on my father's side and a, you grow up on a farm, um, you know, it's just, just, uh, just, um, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a simple guy. It's a simple, it's a simple way of life, you know what I mean? And that's, that's just how we grew up. We, you know, my dad, you know, he always instilled in me and me and my, I have to give so much credit to my father and my grandfather. I mean, I might, you know, I mean, they just stay instilled so much in me of what's right and what mattered, you know, you know, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:05:15       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:05:16       we're talking a lot of your childhood was an, and I wrote down these notes, farm work, football and females. Yeah, yeah. I mean that's a, that I told you I'm simple. Yeah, that's it. You know, there's not much else. Ain't Columbia, Kentucky though. And uh, you know, you wrote, you wrote a book, the book is called into the fire and that's where I'm getting some of my information for, from an a, and I would say that in the early descriptions, the way you described yourself, not exactly Mr sensitive is, is what we were dealing with back then.

Speaker 3:          00:05:50       No, not at all. Um, you know, I was, no, I wasn't sensitive. I was, um, I was just a hard kid, you know, um, set in my ways. I, I, you know, my dad just instilled in me, my dad is still, I mean, you know, my dad is a man who doesn't, he doesn't care the social status. He's not, uh, you know, he, you know, and I watch it from him and he's just a hard, hard, hard guy, you know what I mean? And so there's not living in a house of two men. Right. You know me, it was just my dad, you know, there's not very many feeling,

Speaker 1:          00:06:21       it wasn't a real nourishment to your sensitive side. There was a, there was not much nourishment. Yeah. There's one part of their talking about you're in a football game and you jack up your elbow real bad. And so the coach got you in the locker room or whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:06:34       Yeah. Yeah. So I was, uh, I was sitting in the locker room and I mean, I, I had carried the ball probably 18, 19 times the first half, and I'd go in there and my elbows are like, just jacked. Right? I mean, you know, just, we were just getting pounded. And, um, I remember sitting in there and the coach like, Hey, don't come out next half. Right. You know, you just look, you know, cause it was a Jv game and he's like, you know, don't come out in the next half and I'm gonna tell you something. My dad seeing that I didn't come off when we were warming up for a second half and I mean he came in there and that was not, that was not acceptable. But one thing my dad taught me is you start it, you finish it, check, check. Now

Speaker 1:          00:07:11       what happened to that football career? What'd you get? You get, you did get some like legitimate injury,

Speaker 3:          00:07:15       right? Yeah, yeah. I know. I got, I, you know, I banged my knee up real bad on my sophomore year between my sophomore and junior year. Never really recovered from it, you know. Um, and so, I mean, I could've went and played somewhere. Like, I'm not going to still come nuggets here and tell you I'd had full scholarships or anything, but I could've, I could've walked on somewhere, you know, probably played outside linebacker or you know, a strong safety. But, um, you know, I just, I was going to go play football and I had planned on that. I had been through the clearinghouse. I mean, I'd done everything I needed to do to go in and, you know, my senior year and I just, and I ended up going in the Marine Corps route. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:48       Now I, I've, I've talked a few times down here about the effectiveness of the Marine Corps recruiting program, which they have like the best recruiting numbers, but they spend the least on recruiting of, of any of the military service branches. And it sounds like you've got rolled right into that.

Speaker 3:          00:08:05       I did. They got me, they got me. Let me tell you something. They, uh, they got me, you know, but, but I think, look, I, you know, the products, the product with them, right? Like, you know, you, you know, you're either, you're either going to be a marine or you're not going to be a marine, right? Like you're, you either have it in here, you don't like, it's not, you know, they just, they just know how to talk to their own. Right. And I think that's what they're so good at is, is that they know how they know what would have fired them up. And so they say the same thing that would have fired them up. And if you buy it on it, then you're, the type of person needs to be a marine. And if you don't, they don't want you anyway. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:08:40       Yeah, yeah. That's a perfect way to put it. And this is 2006 2006 2006 and again, this is not my, I always have to remind myself and I'll remind everyone else while I'm at it, is, you know, when I joined the

Speaker 3:          00:08:51       eve in 1990 there was no war going on,

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       right? There was no war going on. It was just, you know, peacetime. And you're joining in 2006 where we're award to different countries and 2006 things are not going well. They're a little quiet in Afghanistan at that time. But Iraq is full bore. I mean, that's when I was in Ramadi and it was, it was a real hard fighting was taking place and on all on Bart province, the rest of Iraq was pretty bad. So, you know, for you, you know, you're going and you know you're going to go to combat. I mean, that's just like

Speaker 3:          00:09:22       kind of a given. Yeah, I mean I, um, I don't know that I ever really understood that though, until I was in, you know what I mean? I think that, I don't think it ever really hit me. Um, I never really, I didn't really join. I can't sit here and give you some Modo story that I joined to go, you know, the advantage night 11 or you want to hear something that's jacked up. I joined in 1990 and I had the opposite viewpoint, which is, I mean, you know, there was no war going on, although I'm not so sure I was going to war. I was like, oh, it's all Sheila's got to be doing things all over and doing stuff we don't even hear about. That's what my attitude is. And here you were staring at Duke War in two different, two different zones and you're like, I don't know if it will really happen.

Speaker 3:          00:09:59       I mean, honestly, I did. I know it sounds dumb, but I mean like, I, you know, by that time we're five years past it and people had already got used to it. Right. It was no longer like, oh shit, you know, in, in like the population, you know, in the, you know, the average civilian. Right. It wasn't, you know, cause it, they've been doing it for what, five years? Yeah. And, um, so, you know, I didn't really think about it and I, you know, I honestly, you know, I joined a, I, you know, I wanted to go infantry. I wanted to fight. Um, but I didn't really, I don't think it ever really hit me until I got into boot camp, you know? And then I really started understanding what, and when you were going boot through boot camp at that time, basically every drill instructor must have been coming back from the battlefield. All of them. I mean, I'm telling you, everybody, especially, uh, especially in a school of infantry, everyone of them had been, they were shoes you. Yeah. I mean everyone, I've been in the shit. Yeah. You know, even my recruiter, my recruiter had just got back from Fallujah. Dang. Yeah. And He'd been in the shit. Dang.

Speaker 1:          00:10:59       Yeah. So with that, I'm going to take it to the book right now because you know, I think I was never in the Marine Corps. I'm pretty sad about that sometimes. But I have like read so much about the Marine Corps over my life and be hung around with so many marines and work with bringing so much. So whenever I get to Marine Corps boot camp, it's like strikes. A romantic side of me just wants to at least get a little taste and, and you did it really fast, which is great. But here, here it isn't. It's just like exactly what we're going to the book again, this book is into the fire by Dakota Meyer and here we go. So it began close haircuts to strip away your old identity exercises to prove you're not half as strong as you figured, simple tasks to show you that you're mentally weak.

Speaker 1:          00:11:50       Drill instructors who mock your attempts to look. It's right out of the movies, but it never stops. And there you go. You know what's coming. How many times did you watch full metal jacket before he went in a time? Yeah, I mean I timed, you know exactly what's going to happen. Does that even help? Uh, no. It's just still, you could, I mean you, you know, like during bootcamp it was the hardest thing I'd ever been through. But when I look at everything I did in the Marine Corps, it was the easiest. That's the same thing with buds. So first of all, when I went through buds and I didn't know anything about buds, no one knew anything about buds in 1990 when I joined the Navy didn't know anything about it. And, and so I always think that the guys are coming in now. You can basically watch the entire bud.

Speaker 1:          00:12:34       You can watch the whole thing. You know what, they, they, the students eventually captured the schedules and so they actually know what's coming and you know, you know how many people it keeps from quitting. None. It's still the same attrition to, okay, so it's going to suck really bad and now you know it, you didn't know it before you even know when it's going to end. You know what I mean? Alright. Uh, back to the book. The second month is the turnaround when they build you back up. Sergeant Brady made me a squad leader, meaning he yelled at me for the mistakes and the other 10 recruits, that was all right. He had his job. I had mine. You bust it through, you get to graduation day, which was obviously awesome. And then it's, I spent the next two months at Soi School of Infantry. Only 15% of the marine corps and the army are in the infantry.

Speaker 1:          00:13:24       In today's military there are more combat pilots and infantry squad leaders. Dang. Yeah. Ah, man, that's crazy. 15% of the marine corps and the army are infantry troops for the ground. That's, that's an interesting figure in Vietnam. And I was talking about this with life and with actually the whole echelon front team the other day, I had heard this somewhere, I heard it from Hackworth, that in Vietnam, the height of the Vietnam War, there was a little over 500,000 troops on the ground and it was only 10% of those troops that were, you know, infantry units that were on the ground in combat. Yeah. You, you know what I find so interesting about that fact and that stat when I looked at it, you know, like I didn't understand it obviously when I was in, but you know, what I look at it is to understand like how much it truly, you know, as, as the war fighter, you know, I think we take for granted so many times of what it really takes for us to be able to do our job effectively.

Speaker 1:          00:14:13       I mean, you take it, I mean, it takes, you know, 85% of the organization just to support that 15% to put you yes. Face to face with the enemy. There's gotta be another. Yeah. I mean you look at it 10 to one 15 to one or something like that. It's crazy. Tend to one that's got to put you up there. Yeah, but that's what works and that's, well here we go. Breaking down, breaking down a little bit of what the Marine Corps like. A Marine squad is comprised of three, four man fire teams. Everything you do as a rifleman revolves around that four man team. A one man carries a weapon more powerful than those of the others, but that's a minor point in the field. You don't do anything without those other guys. You don't shit sleep, eat or move without the other three knowing about it.

Speaker 1:          00:14:57       Yeah. A Marine squad with those three fire teams is like a boxer with three arms, one arm jabs with bursts of fire to keep the opponent off balance while the other arm loops around a left hook with a third arm ready to follow up wherever there's an opening. If one arm is wounded, the other two can keep fighting. Fire to pin down the enemy maneuver to finish them off fire and maneuver, fire maneuver, fire maneuver. And I always have to point this out. Extreme ownership, you know, this is covering move. This is what I was talking about. The fundamental, that's the fundamental gun fighting tactic. Yes. Fire maneuver. I was called a cover and move. So you get done with Soi and you head out to the Third Marine regiment in Hawaii. Yeah. That, so how was that when you're checking in?

Speaker 3:          00:15:46       Oh yeah. Well we pulled in and as soon as we pulled the bus in, the, uh, seniors, uh, you know, they're all, they had all just got back from a hadith of the triad and I had a hard deployment. They got, they got the shit kicked out of him. And uh, and uh, so we pull in in a, you know, there's no empathy there. And so we pull in and they're throwing beer bottles off the deck and they are all hammered. It's in the middle of the night. And um, you know, so it's like welcome, you know, but it was awesome. You know, I was honored to be out there. And then how long did it take for the sniper bill it to open up and for you to get that? Yeah, so it was a, I think it was like around February. Uh, so I got there in October.

Speaker 3:          00:16:29       So September. No, so I got there in October, November. So November timeframe, I think I got to why October, November timeframe and then I, it opened in January, February timeframe. Hard to get a snack. Isn't it hard to get a sniper built? Did you get lucky at need a new guy get us Naperville. So I did. So I was actually the youngest sniper in the Marine Corps in 2007. Um, so what happened was, is I had Brandon the Indoc, so you have to run an Indoc to be part of the platoon. So you come in and then like you, you, you're on probation, so you run a huge Indoc, you come in and you go on probation and then you start, um, you know, usually you were go on deployment and then after deployment you go to school. Well, they had a couple of schools so I had to open up and a score and they basically gave me the option of you can either go home on predeployment leave cause we were heading that rack. You can either go and predeployment leave or you can go to sniper school. I was a 18 how many milliseconds did it take you to make that decision? I said, I said I've been with my family for 18 years. I'm, I'm all good.

Speaker 1:          00:17:22       Oh man, that's awesome. And then Marine Corps sniper school, uh, that's a, that's a hardcore school and 50% attrition rate. Yeah. And seals in it with this. Yeah. And then you know, our early seal snipers, you know, and I don't know the full, I'll bring a sniper on here someday that knows the whole history of the seal sniper program. But it's deeply rooted in the Marine Corps sniper program. Deeply rooted. Just like all of our training is rooted in the Marine Corps and Raiders. There's a lot

Speaker 3:          00:17:49       of crossover in those early days. But Marine, the Marine Corps sniper program, now everyone's going to think that's a civilian's going to think like, oh, you're sitting on a gun shooting. But, but that's not really the hardest part. Is it 5% of the job? Like it's like the, it's, I would say, yeah, I would say it's less than that, you know, you know, I mean, you gotta I mean the communication piece of it, the mission planning, the, I mean, there's so much, I mean, you, you literally, you literally are the, uh, you know, the commanders, the battalion commander's trigger finger.

Speaker 3:          00:18:21       You guys do heavy stocking. Right? That's just a gut check. And how much did you weigh at this point? Uh, probably about 180. Okay. 85. And it's, um, where do you guys do your stocks? Uh, so we were in Hawaii, so I went to Hawaii sniper school. Okay. Um, and we do a mountain, the cuckoo's out and just dripping sweat. Oh, lane in, they're crawling. Walking is terrible. Scrawling for four hours and going 35 meters. Yeah, I mean, just like, you know, you know, you start off, you got thousand meter lane, you know, and they're, they put an observer up and they're using the best glass there is. And they're sitting on this truck and a, you have to, you have to move up. And, um, you got to get within a, you know, at a certain distance and whatever they tell you. And then you get, you know, you have to veg up and whatever you take shot, you can do whatever you, you know, you take a shot with a blank.

Speaker 3:          00:19:12       Okay. And then they come over and so the, the bigger walker on a walker on you and then they try to walk, you know, back and forth, they try to find you. If they see you or anything, then you know, you lose. Um, and then you got to take a second shot. Wild. They're, you know, cause that Walker gets within the vicinity of you and like, it's like 10 or 20 meters and then you take a second shot and if they see anything, then you know, you, you, you, you failed too. So it's, you know, yeah. And it's a walker. So basically they bring a guy out who is like, who you know has like a stick or something and they can see them and then they tried to say it so they go, okay, I think I see him here. So I need you to take left three steps and then back four steps.

Speaker 3:          00:19:53       They tried to walk him on you. Gotcha. This will be interesting when they get to you, do they say sniper at your feet to the guy? Huh? So yeah, you have to say it sniper at your feet. That's the same thing that they say in the seal sniper school. That's what they said to get there. And they go, okay, sniper your feet though. Yep. Your boss. Did you fail? Three, three steps left. Two steps up. Sniper at your feet. Yup. They'll say, nope. You know what I mean? And so there's, there's the crossover that shows you that that's, that stuff has rooted together and there's a guy by the name of skin to who was one of your instructors. You were born your instructors, right? Yeah. And here's a, here's a, going back to the book skin to told us about a sniper team in an Overwatch and a half constructed building in Ramadi in 2004. It was a warm, dull day and after several hours, they dozed off and never awakened in. Surgeon sneaked up and shot all four marines in the head. They left behind a high powered EMM 48 83 and it's excellent Schmidt and bender scope. Over

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       the course of the next year, they allegedly killed two more Americans before marine sniper took them out and recovered the rifle. Skint hammered home his message, no every aspect of your job and never, never let down your guard. If you slack off or you take things for granted, you die.

Speaker 3:          00:21:04       He, um, I, I had a lot. Look, I was fortunate to have a lot of people around me that influenced me. I mean, I'm, I'm nothing special. I'm the product of my environment and my, I'm direct reflection on my leadership. I'm so fortunate, but I'll tell you right now that when I did that day was because of him was it was because of the mentality that he instilled in me. Um, knowing your job, knowing it and obsessing with it and knowing every aspect of it and no one everybody else's job around you. And then when you know your job and you know what's right you, you do that, you don't worry about what everybody else says.

Speaker 4:          00:21:40       Yeah. The, the, the noncommissioned officers that, again, they're same guys that raised me in the seal teams have such a huge impact. And what, what I also found interesting about this was this story about the snipers. When I got to Ramadi in 2006, we heard this exact story and you know, it, it was another thing that made us more paranoid and made my guys more paranoid being out there. And we actually had thought, I didn't, this has 2004 we thought it happened a little bit later and closer to our deployment. But um, yeah, man, just a, just a nightmare. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:22:16       Another little commentary from you here back to the book shooting another human being was a math problem. You are either right or wrong with no subjective in between decided by someone else. I liked problems that were black and white life or death before taking a shot at a target 1000 meters away, you had to calculate the effects of the light air at altitude, wind, humidity, angle of fire, cartridge velocity and gravity. You had to align the target, the background of the terrain, the weather, the noise and the weapon. You had to work in concert with others. At the same time, the target enemy was figuring out how to kill you. Combat was a zero sum making played for the highest stakes, live or die.

Speaker 4:          00:22:59       And the 31 people started the course and 13 people graduated so that, that should tell everyone why that sniper designation is so damn hard to get it cause it's no joke. And there's usually at any point in time there's not. There's usually around 300 school trained snipers in the Marine Corps to anytime really? Dang. Oh, that's in my task unit, which is about 40 seals. We had 13 snipers. It was so awesome. Yellows killers got lucky. You know, I got lucky that the stars aligned. Okay, so now you're trained up and then in 2007, you deploy, you deployed to Iraq? I did first deployment. How pumped palm you. I was pumped. I have and I just, I just got out of school trained man, you know, I'm

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       ready to go. I'm ready to go turn the heat up. Right. And um, and where we were going was actually a bad spot. I mean we were in Karma. Yup. And uh, it, it had, it had been bad, but it was like we were part of that search and uh, when we got there, we took some contact once and I just like to waterfalls. It turned off, you go from streets that you're fighting down to. Next thing you know, I mean, you could walk out with no gear. It's, what were you guys doing? Just doing patrols? We were doing a lot of dwell ops, which is what we'd go out basically what they were, the, the theory on this was we would go out off the farm and stay like four or five days in a house and you know, um, you know, we would get hit by indirect fire, uh, you know, some, but I mean, but I was only there for like 45 days and then you got hit in the hand would go what I got, I got bid on the right hand, my right hand by a spider and a actually suffered severe nerve damage.

Speaker 3:          00:24:38       Lost the movement in my last three fingers and a big chasm act you for this? Yeah. Or medivaced you back to Germany. Yeah. So they send me to Al-assad and tried to fix it there. I did. I, they, they rushed me and I had two surgeries and can't flew gia. And then, um, they, they moved me to outside and they sent me back to Germany and I was there for like 25 days in the hospital in Germany to save your hand basically. And then they sent me home and then I was having to do occupational therapy to get, you know, to get my fingers back. They wouldn't move, you know? When were you back in Kentucky? No, I was back at Hawaii. Hawaii in my unit. And, but you did have a little bit of Kentucky with you there in the form of Bourbon? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:25:17       Yeah. A lot of it. I was drinking. How's the drinking started getting after it a little bit. I did. And even a little bit too much. Yeah. Too much. You know, I started, you know, it was hard. It was hard coming home and knowing my teammates were still over there and no one that, my unit was still there and I wasn't part of it, you know? And then did you go, did you have to go back or you came back to states like on leave? Uh, no. No. After you were, after your hand was hurt. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I came back to Kentucky Grata. And you hung out there for awhile and actually lost a couple friends at that time. I did it. I did cause she was tragical tragic situations. Yeah, it was terrible. You know, I had a guy, the guy, you know, actually his, you know, his name is on my chest and um, he, we played football together and uh, he had called me, I was leaving the hospital and I was coming home that weekend and he had called me, he had called me right before I was on the way to the hospital and said, hey, you, hey man, we're going to go to this football game.

Speaker 3:          00:26:10       You know, we're going to watch my little brother play, you know, all of that. And I got a call as soon as I was leaving the hospital and he had, um, he'd had a wreck and got killed. Yeah. Close, close friend. Then I lost a, um, another friend she got, she got killed in December. Um, not, not exactly what you want to go home or leave for, man. That's harsh. No, no, no. But you know, it's, it's just the way, the way it goes. You know, they're in, and then you say you spend that time at home, you go back, you rejoin your return. And this is when you find out that they want volunteers to go help out in Afghanistan. Yeah. So we built up weed. I was back probably a year, year and a half, went to mountain sniper school. And, um, you know, I became in charge of my own team, um, but got married til he actually promoted.

Speaker 3:          00:26:51       Um, I was, you know, I was a lance corporal lead, a five man team with a sergeant on it, you know, and uh, you know, I, uh, ended up taking, like I had the worst, like I got like the newest guys, they gave me the newest guys and uh, we ended up being the general support team. So we moved all the way up to the platoon and ended up being, you know, one of the best, one of the best teams. And I'm stern and um, yeah, so we're out at 29 palms doing her final train up to go back to Iraq. And this was when nothing was going on in 2009. I mean, they weren't letting you leave the wire. Right. And, uh, we had no mission, so it kind of sucked. Right. And, uh, they came and said, we need five volunteers, go to Afghanistan.

Speaker 3:          00:27:28       And I said, what's the mission? I said, we don't know, but we just need five bodies. And I raised my hand, said, yeah, I'm, I'm ready to go again. Like how many milliseconds? Zero. That decision. And so that what you were volunteering for, you find out later is, is, uh, embedded training team and advisory teams. Know what that's all about. So an embedded training team is where they take a, you know, they take different ranks and different skillsets of marines and they put them or you know, whatever, you know, military unit and they put them together and they embed them with a, you know, a, an Afghan unit. So we were embedded with the Ade Afghan's a whole, not a, it was a company. And so that's, that's, we just lived, we did everything with them. We did everything from, you know, teach them weapons, tactics and, and uh, you know, um, shooting, shooting.

Speaker 3:          00:28:16       We, I did the change over for the NATO weapons, right? So we took them from cause Soviet to the natal weapons. And that's another key factor that we need to bring up to talk about and that gunfight. Um, so we were teaching them on that call and them all and that, you know, everything from everything. I mean, we, we did everything with these guys cause, and then could you, did you do any kind of work up before you went over? Yeah. So we that was it with that team. Yeah. Your actual team that you were gonna deploy with. Yeah. So we did, we did a workup with them. Actually, no, I just left 29 palms. I go back and we trained for like a month or two in Okinawa, Japan with this new team. And then we head back to 29 palms and then we go from, well we went back, so he went to Bridgeport and then we came down 29 palms.

Speaker 3:          00:28:57       We did all our mountain stuff at Bridgeport, um, all our mules and all that stuff, you know, pack. And then, uh, we came down and did it ended in 29 palms and then we headed over. And that was with that four man team? Yeah. With a Lieutenant Johnson, gunny Kenefick, um, and doc late and myself and we'll talk about those guys a little bit here in the book. We've done it, Mike Johnson's Forman team at Monte. This is where you end up place called Monte, which is 10 miles worth north of another fob called Joyce, Lieutenant Johnson Sani and smiling with an easy laugh but completely professional with the highest standards. I'd climbed mountains with him in California of course, and I knew he was a strong physically as he was

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       mentally. Staff Sergeant Aaron Kenefick was a personnel specialist with eight years expertise in administration. So his job was to bring some order to the Afghan personnel procedures and pre pay records. Doc Leighton are corpsman, would provide some basic medical care to the Afghans and the villages, but it's primary job was to be ready in case any advisors or Afghan soldiers were wounded. I had a job to lieutenant Johnson put me in charge of tactics operations in weapons training before each patrol I approved of the Afghan scheme of maneuver, inspected the radios and guns, coordinated fire support and planned and emergency escape route. This was far easier than planning the sniper missions I had been trained for. So you, you were, you were kind of the most tactically savvy guy in the group Vena sniper already deployed to Iraq.

Speaker 3:          00:30:33       Yeah, no, I was, and you don't want, and what will prepare me was my training that I deal with my team. Um, you know, my sniper team. I mean, look, I, I, you know, people thought I was crazy. They thought I was crazy the way that I was training in my platoon before. You're like, we're going to Iraq, we're not gonna do anything. I'm like, I don't give a shit. Right? Like, I'm, I was still learning, tack sat and I was still learning, you know, Satcom and I was still learning and HF and I was still learning how to low crypt. I mean, I wanted to know every aspect of every part of the job. I was learning every, I was going over to the, to the Bas and learning, uh, you know, all the medical stuff that I could, and I was, you know, I mean everything I could do, like if I could get just a little nugget in knowledge and better myself in every aspect that was doing it.

Speaker 3:          00:31:10       And, um, so yeah. So when I got over to this team, I mean, you know, I, I was the only tactical guy in there, you know, and, uh, yeah. And it was, you know, they, they were, when it came to the tactics, when it came to making sure that the weapons were ready, when it came to making sure that the vehicles are ready, that, that the, that the, you know, that, uh, the jammers, we're working that, you know, if anything that mattered in the patrol, it was on me, on you. Yeah. That trucks were loaded.

Speaker 1:          00:31:40       And the reason that the Marine Corps put the teams together like this is because, well, that they're trying to develop the whole Afghan army, every aspect of it, not just the tactical side, but they want like the administration. So that the people can start getting paid on time and the organization, so they got the lieutenant in there and at the same time they want to help the villagers. So they put a corpsman in there. So do medical work. So that's kind of just a name. If everyone's thinking, why the hell would you put together a team like that? It's because the people that are supposed to do the fighting are actually supposed to be the Afghans. Right? Yes. And, and, and the team is there to support them, help them train them, and get them ready. Yeah. And that's, that's the mind. That's the theory, right? The theory is that you train,

Speaker 3:          00:32:19       you train them and they do the fighting and you're just there to advise them. Right. Um, but it never was works

Speaker 1:          00:32:25       that way. It does. It didn't work that way in Iraq. And, and one of the things that I pointed out many times was, you know, what kind of your you want to develop a relationship with, with a group, right? And, and now you say, okay, we're going to train you, but when it come time to do something dangerous, you guys go by yourselves. That's not, you're not building a relationship. You're, you're in fact you're going backwards. No. Yeah, it's the same way. Oh, so you get there and you start doing, you're just kinda going on patrols to going on patrols with the, with the Afghan army company.

Speaker 3:          00:32:54       It was kind of interesting, you know, cause I was kind of the high strung one on the team. You know, like I was like the one that always was, you know, we need to be ready to fight. You know, I don't know how many arguments I got into with some of the, the, the leadership in teams, you know, cause we, we were 21 man team, but we were broken into four main elements and spread out, you know, in, in this area. And I don't know how many times I got into arguments with people and the team of, you know, hey, this is how we need to do it. We need to stay up. I mean, I was, I was trying to train them, I was doing stuff of, you know, trying to train them to do ivs at night with nods. And they're like, why the hell are we doing this? You know what I mean? Like in a lot of people look down on it and, uh, and, and I said, I'm going to prepare to fight. And they said, you know, we're not, you know, they saw many times leadership got on me. We're not going over there to fight. We're going to advise. And that was the mindset of a lot of this, and I'm not gonna say my team, but a lot of the team and uh,

Speaker 1:          00:33:44       and it showed, yeah, yeah. You know, for everyone out there, that's it. Wearing a uniform right now, man. Be ready for the worst case scenario all the time. You're not ready for it.

Speaker 3:          00:33:54       You know what I tell him he is? I said, you know, Lieutenant Johnson was, uh, was a, a calm guy, satellite guy, doc late and was a blue side Korman and gunny Kenefick was an s one guy, you know, and I always wonder, do you think that they ever thought they'd be, and one of the deadliest battles in Afghanistan, do you think they ever thought they didn't?

Speaker 1:          00:34:16       You know, you don't know where you're going to be at, but one day you're going to be tested. Yeah, you better be ready. So you guys are rolling out on these patrols. Here's a good kind of aspect of what you see on those patrols. And you called the army. The Afghan army soldiers ask ours. Am I saying that other call? NASCARS nascars all right, here we go. Back to the book. When we walked into some hamlets, you could feel something was wrong. When kids threw rocks at you, you knew what the parents were telling them. Sometimes the ass cars grabbed the kids soccer balls and slice them apart. This didn't win any hearts and minds, but it did stop the rocks. Whenever the elders hurried through the ceremonial tea though I'd watch the ass cars when any soldier senses danger. He crouches down a few inches to make himself less of a target when the ass cars did that.

Speaker 1:          00:35:07       I went on full alert Hafez ms saying that right? Yeah. So his name is [inaudible] so I had named him Hafez in that to protect him. Got It. He's how he's here in America now. Okay. We're good. Hafez was our lead interpreter and we quickly learned our best warning system at a 37 year old sergeant major retired from the Afghan army. Hafez had served in Kuhner for three years with advisor teams. The Afghan soldiers distrusted him because he refused to support their never ending schemes to skim off the Americans. So he's your, your most trusted advisor. Interesting that you point out how when, when soldiers sense danger. And I was telling you about JP, my lead sniper and one of my two platoons and t you bruiser. And when he came on the podcast, I'd described him walking through the streets. And you and I, because like I told you, man, I don't think JP was going to live because JP was too brave for his own damn good.

Speaker 1:          00:36:00       But when I'd, you know, I'd, I'd be watching, I'd be like, like holding security and watching patrol go and you'd see, you know, I'd see guys moving with that little crouch cause everyone's expecting that the shooting's going to start. And I'd see JP man walking with his head up and his chest out, like ready to get something. It's nice to be 23 years old. I'm not that you could die. So that's my brother Jake. And the other thing that, you know, when you're in these foreign countries, when we were in Iraq and Afghanistan, the locals, we can't tell the difference between it. We really can't tell a difference between a good buy in a bag. I now you learned some sense of it where you go, okay, that guy looks shady and you're, you're probably pretty accurate. But the a guy let cuff Hafez, you get to know, you can get to know instantly.

Speaker 1:          00:36:45       He was the unofficial fifth member of our team inside of Hamlet. If he shook his head at us, we knew it was time to forget the tea and get out. So w how much good, how much, how often would you go into a handle it and the people were cool and all good and drinking tea and you know, most of the time, I mean most of them look, I mean look, I, you know, the people there want it to be better. I mean they live in the shift. Yeah. They live there. They want it to be better. You know, they're just caught in a bad situation. It's not a, it's not a, it's not a simple equation. You know, there's nothing simple about the life that they have to live. You made some friends going back to the book in the hills along the Pakistani border.

Speaker 1:          00:37:25       No Afghan military or civilian had much of anything. I think practically every American soldier marine tried to help in some way. We purchase candy and trinkets in the markets to give the kids, I assume had two little buddies boys about 10 or 11 they'd hang around the main gate. Jaelyn my e. Dot. A. Dot. Trying to say your name when they saw me at first, I buy him cokes and then started sharing my care packages from home soap, candy, peanuts, gone gum maybe a decade from now. Some kids remember that some Americans were kind to them even when they're older brothers were shooting at them. Maybe not. You don't help out because you expect something in return. So you're, you're a human being man. Trying to try to take care of some kids a lot there. Um, I think this is getting into your first sort of legit, we'll call it combat and a, you're taking some small arms fire.

Speaker 1:          00:38:22       I'm going to the book here. Staff sergeant can affect was standing outside a bunker about 100 feet from me. Meyer, we're under attack. He yelled technically, yes, but the shepherd, there's some shepherd out there, but the shepherd was shooting without poking his head up to aim. He had one chance in a thousand of hitting us, a second harmless, harmless burst, followed the bullets cracking more than 10 feet above our head call for already. Now staff sergeant can affect yelled holding. The radio had a headset out towards me. Oh Nice staff sergeant. Soon to be Gunnery Sergeant Kaktovik needed the lowly corporals help. I trotted towards him. Stopped, assumed parade. Rest postures aren't locked behind my back chest. Push forward in the wide open and pasted to respectful expression on my face. What does the staff sergeant wish the corporal to do? Another burst from the Aka. This is no time to be a smart ass Meyer.

Speaker 1:          00:39:13       A few more rounds. Still way too high. I'm locked at parade rest. I staff sergeant, he balanced the headset considering whether to throw it at me. Meyer hurry up. He had started calling in the artillery mission and when I got to him he was asking me, what do I say now? Left 100 drop 200 I said he repeated it on the radio. What now? He asked fire for effect. I said, should be dead on. Okay. Fire for effect. He repeated over the radio and that's it. You hit the guy. But uh, it's funny that you, even in that situation, um, you were talking about being kind of a wise ass when you're a kid, you're still a wise ass.

Speaker 3:          00:39:51       Yeah. You know the thing about Ken, if Duke was, me and him were butting heads real hard at that time, you know, we were butting heads. Um, you know how some people would just take over. Like he, he, he took over and tried to make up for his lack of, you know, nothing against him. And he wasn't a combat. I mean it wasn't his job, but what he tried to make up for in the lack of his combat knowledge was his authority. Right. And so, you know, he, he had kind of pissed me off pretty bad about, you know, asking me to do you, can you stand at parade rest? Like he was all big on it. Right. And it's like we're on, we're on a cop. Like, you know, we, you know, you still need it, but you know, customs and courtesies, right? Yeah. And so I used that, that situation to make a point, you know, he just kind of pushed me over the edge and then, but after that we,

Speaker 1:          00:40:33       yeah, that's kind of broad. You broke us all, you know. That's awesome. Great. You had some good Afghan soldiers and under, you were talking to me about them early. One guy by the name of dawn Ali. Here you go. He was fun to talk to, open, friendly and fearless. We'd sit around talking and asking questions of each other. Like kids in middle school learning as much as we could about each other. He proudly cleaned his soft five times a day and absorbed every tip I gave him about shooting. He was the most disciplined ask are on base. That's why we gave him the salt in the first place. She had good relationship with that.

Speaker 3:          00:41:03       Yeah, I mean I had a good relationship with all my Afghans. I mean I, I I at least two meals a day with them. Um, you know, usually I didn't eat breakfast with them. I would eat it over at the, uh, over at the, uh, you know, the Chow Hall. But I used, you know, that was my, that was my policy. I mean, every night I ate dinner with them, every single night I would eat dinner with my Afghan soldiers because I was no better than them.

Speaker 1:          00:41:28       You know, sometimes I hear, I hear people, you know, people that don't understand all what was going on in Iraq or Afghanistan, they'll, you know, you, you, we were occupied. America was occupiers and how could you do it? And it's like I always remind them like we were fighting alongside the Iraqi soldiers fighting alongside the Afghan soldiers. I mean, spilling blood. Yeah. I mean, we weren't, I mean, just cause it was Iraq and Afghanistan war. We weren't fighting Iraq and Afghanistan. We were fighting with them. We weren't fighting against Iraq or Afghanistan. We were fighting next to them. You know, we were helping them against the same enemy. You know, so many people miss that point, man. And his feeds up. It's an important point to be missed. It's a big, it's a big fat man. I hear that. And it just turns my stomach man.

Speaker 1:          00:42:16       Um, now I kind of joked about that, that first situation being your first combat and now you had legit your first kind of trial by fire. You're at combat because you're at the outpost at Cop Monte and you're under attack. You actually got some wounded, some ass cars are wounded and you're here. We're going back to book. Where's dad? Where's staff sergeant can affect? I yelled, doc late and pointed toward the North East Tower. Get over there and stay with him. I yelled, suicide bombers sometimes rush the wire trying to take an take an infidel with them as they evaporated in a red flash without hesitating doc late and ran down the stairs across the open space and into the tower with Staff Sergeant Kenefick. Two or three seconds later or rocket slammed into their bunker, exploding into pieces and Afghan worker huddled there behind beside the sandbags, smoke rolled out of the tower.

Speaker 1:          00:43:04       They're gone. I yelled to Johnson not believing what I had just seen. I resumed firing. It's all you can do. The best first aid at that point was to return fire. Johnson worked the radio, Fox three one fox. We won. This is Fox three staff sergeant can affect doc late and come on answer up. We kept firing, but it seemed unworldly. Now we were on automatic. Lieutenant Johnson got on the radio again. Three one fox three one. This is Fox. Three staffs aren't in. Can Effect Dot Leighton. Come on, man. Answer up then finally. Yeah. Yeah. This is three one we're good. 10 minutes later or attack helicopters began. Strafing runs low rumbling burrs like a giant burping, incredible fire power. Those lovely birds and to me, fire ceased. Attack over Johnson and I ran over to the bunker. A Staff Sergeant Kenefick and doc late and stumbled out.

Speaker 1:          00:43:55       The four of us sat on the bloody sandbags and the growing dust talking about it. Their eyes were slightly glazed and wide, wide open. Lieutenant John Johnson, staff sergeant can affect doc and doc Leighton weren't infantry. They had considered that by coming to Afghanistan they might die, but it hadn't kicked in until now. Now they had heard the screams and seeing the blood. Everybody suit covered. Understood. Now that if we went home together, it might not be alive. The ass cars were cleaning up the bloody mess, not six feet from us taking away the rip, the body of their friend. We mumbled some stuff. All of us

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       were too embarrassed to talk about our feelings, but we knew what we were all thinking this shit was for real and there were only four of us will be there for each other doc late and said, the surfer dude surprised me. He had said the one thing that made any sense.

Speaker 3:          00:44:51       Yeah, that was, um,

Speaker 5:          00:44:55       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:44:56       that was the Sunday before. Uh, so ganja gold was on a, on a Tuesday. That was September 6th of 2009 is a huge rocket attack. I mean, they were dialed in. It was terrible. Like I can remember it as if I was there. It was terrible. How many rocks they fire. Oh, I think we had nine that hit that one. Oh seventh did hit dead on like in not just nine. That hit just inside of, of, not the whole base, but just my Afghan base. It's probably this, you know, where we're at right now is probably bigger than that. He was terrible. And that was a wake up call. Oh, it was for all of us. I mean, it was for all of us and it was for them. And I, you know, I'll never forget, um,

Speaker 5:          00:45:44       yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:45:44       You know, I'll never forget talk. I mean, we finally sat down and talked about what do we do if we lose one of it, you know, what do we want? And, um, gosh, it was so real. And you know, I'll never forget Kenefick I had, um, I had met a, backed out a guy, oh, the wounded soldier that day. Um, and he was putting me in for a bronze star and I'll never forget he was walking through in the, um, in the little hooch and he said, uh, and where we lived at. And he was just, you know, kind of joking a little bit later on that day. He's like, hell Meyer, you know, the way shit's going for you. And it's unlucky as you are. He goes, you'll probably be in for a medal of honor before this deployments over with. Huh. And, uh, it's his crazy. Yeah. So that's two days before you guys head down to Ganja Gall. We'd actually got the call that night that we were supposed to go to Ganja Gall and the seventh and uh, they ended up pushing it right to the eighth.

Speaker 4:          00:46:44       So we left the next day. We talk a lot about it a little bit here. Ganja Gall, late two miles north of joy. So we drove right by the mouth of the valley. Ganja gall sounded like the name of an Irish town full of smiling faces and friendly pubs. I could see a few of the larger compounds far back on a hillside, nestled against steep ridge lines, bad place, half as muttered bad people. So you're getting right away. Get,

Speaker 3:          00:47:10       I mean, we were told instantly. I mean, we were told like, I mean we, I mean, yeah, there was no doubt.

Speaker 4:          00:47:17       Now one thing that I think made you feel more calm, a little bit more comfortable. You talk about in the book, historically the Taliban had not sprung ambushes from inside villages. So that wasn't discussed at the briefing. Plus we were going in

Speaker 1:          00:47:29       with 90 Afghans and 15 advisors with a platoon from one three to deployed behind us in a quick reaction force. This shows us, this show belongs to the, to our Afghan counterparts. Fabio. Am I saying that right? Yeah, Fabio. Fabio said we advisers will stand off to the side and let them talk with the elders were not in the lead. We're assisting. That made no sense. I thought considering who is doing the briefing and who is hearing yet. We were in the tactical lead even if we claimed otherwise. That's what a little point. But that's a political thing.

Speaker 3:          00:48:04       Um, yeah, I mean I, I think it's an ignorance thing. Well, I think it's an ignorant thing too, but the reason it happened. No, no, no, of course. I mean technically we fail under, so I mean technically the way that this works, it's crazy as this sounds I was working for like my commander was Afghan commander, whatever the Afghan commander told me was what I was supposed to do. Right. I mean, I'm saying that's a political thing for us to say politically, look, the Afghans are running this operation. Yes, yes, yes. I mean that, you know, but that, um, if you remember what I said a little bit earlier about, you know, hey, we're not going to do the fighting. I mean, you know, that, that's the mentality of the leadership of team. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:48:44       Yeah. Not Good. Then as you just said here, that made no sense, I thought, and you were a corporal 20. How old were you? I would say 2121 years old. And you're looking at this going, hey man, this doesn't make any sense. We're the ones that are sitting here briefing it. Yeah. We know where the ones that know how to call for fire. Yeah. I mean, and I brought it, well, I mean, first off, first off, the Afghans can't even talk to anybody that calls for fire or the helicopters. I mean, they don't even have any comms with them. Their own h f you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. I mean, I, so the, the three main factors that I brought up in the brief and I brought up that, look, we're only, everybody's going in, we have over 12 different moving elements between the ops and different teams inside this patrol.

Speaker 3:          00:49:28       Yep. All on one frequency. I brought that up. I brought up the fact that, um, we didn't have direct air support is on 15 minutes strip alert and that's in Jalalabad so all, and you know, so they were taking it as if the birds would be there within 15 minutes. I said, that's not what, 15 minutes Tripler meetings. They're up. That means off the ground in 15 minutes. And then they still got night are probably 60 minutes to get from Jalala bad to us. And so that was another factor. And then the other thing that I brought up was, um, why would we put our snipers 2000 meters away from the village outside of their effective range of their weapons? There you go. But here's what I was told. I'm an e four in the United States Marine Corps. What do I know about mission planning? And that's why I was taken out of the team check. So, um,

Speaker 2:          00:50:18       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:50:18       when you say, when you talk about getting taken out of the team, explain how that went down a little bit. So you've got your four man team. Yeah. Team Monte. Yeah. It's your money. And so what they did was,

Speaker 6:          00:50:28       is, you know, they had, there's like they would put the teams, you know, you would go with your Afghans in here to do their part. Um, so our team was supposed to go to the back of the village, cover the back side of it, and then we were going to search couple house up there for a machine gun. And, um, while the meeting went on and they took me out of the team because I brought up those concerns and, um, you know, they kind of took it as me going against the orders, questioning their authority, and they replaced me at the gunny, gunny Johnson.

Speaker 1:          00:51:02       So I'm just, I just have to say this right now, so I talk about this all the time. And, um, if you're in a leadership position, you don't want, yes, ma'am. You don't want, yes men. You want the the corporal that says, Hey boss, I don't understand why you do that right now. And if your answer to your subordinate is because I said so, or it's you're already for be quiet or you're an e five be quiet. If that's what your answer is, that means you don't have a real answer. That means that what you're doing is probably wrong. So surround yourself, the best people you can have on your team or the people that are going to question what what it is that your, your plan is. And if they question it and you can't, don't have a good logical answer and your plan doesn't stand on its own two feet. Well think about it and reassess it and take some advice from down the chain of command on how what we could do to change this planet.

Speaker 6:          00:51:49       Yeah, I mean it was, look, they're complacent. You know, that's, that's the type of mentality that you have when you don't expect to go get your ass handed to you. That's why you need to expect to get your ass handed to you every day and train like it.

Speaker 1:          00:52:05       Yeah. You know, I, I, I used to, when I was running Turner, we trained for worst case scenario all the time. It was like worse than me. You know what? And it was, it was insane. Like we had great, we had great financing for our training. So the training was awesome. We had mayhem going on, we had paint balls and we had laser, this multi multimillion dollar laser tag system and we had roleplayers and it was awesome. And I wanted may him and we had, we would put guys down and you'd have to carry them out. And it was a, it'd be like we'd be mayhem and sometimes guys, cool, this is coming to and realistic and what are the chances this is really happening? And I'd be like, look, if this doesn't happen, great. You don't ever have to worry about it happen for real. But if it happens, you'll be ready for it. At least as ready as you can be.

Speaker 6:          00:52:48       Yeah. So you get pulled off the team. I got to pull it off the team and my job was going to be to stay with the vehicle. So like basically we were going to drive vehicles in park the vehicles. Now. That was the other thing I said. I said, this is dumb. Why, why would we leave our up armored guns a couple of miles away? And they said, you mean you ready for the response here? You're ready. Oh, well Dakota, uh, because we want to go into the village clendette Stein, you have a 90 man patrol. Yeah. Yeah. That's not going happen. Just to paint

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       a picture for everyone. Basically there's a deep ravine walls on either side at the top of the ravine. It kind of splits into two other ravines and there's kind of villages on both sides of that.

Speaker 6:          00:53:37       Yeah. It splits into, it splits into two. Like it's Kinda like two valleys inside of a big valley. Right. And on the right hand side was another bad valley, but we were going in the left hand side. Now is ganja call. And um, I mean this, this terrain was built to fight. It was built to fight. I mean they had trenches in it, there were trenches in it that they use to fight out of. It is not,

Speaker 4:          00:54:01       and obviously you're walking up the valley, which means automatically you're in the low ground, which is not where we want to be ever. All right. Now you the one of the guys you are going to be working with.

Speaker 2:          00:54:15       MMM.

Speaker 4:          00:54:16       In the Hummers was staff sergeant Juan Rodriguez Chavez. Here we go. Back to the book I sought out Staff Sergeant Juan Rodriguez Chavez are motor transport chief. I known him for five months. He didn't stand on rank and we traded stories about growing up on farms. He had grown up on a ranch in Mexico having a similar approach to life. Rob and I had become friends. He was in the eighth grade when his family moved to Texas where he learned English, played football, earned good grades and rope cows and Rodeos. Our team called him hot rod. He laughed a lot, bragged about how smart his two daughters were and kept all our vehicles in top condition. Rob, this mission is fucked up if the shit hits the fan. I said, we're going in my teams walking point and they'll get caught off. We have to go in and get them out. And he looked back at you devil dog. Rod said, say the word and I'll do the driving.

Speaker 6:          00:55:15       Yeah, that's legit. He's the man. He is the man. And uh,

Speaker 4:          00:55:22       continuing on, you say having some sort of contingency plan. Now I walked back to the adviser headquarters and brief Lieutenant Johnson. By the way, Lieutenant Johnson didn't want you out of the team either. Right? He wanted you to stay with Canon. Fake were pissed. He knew that you should be with the team if things get hairy. I said I'm coming in, rod will drive radio your coordinates and get down to the wash fucking climate and we'll haul ass back to the main body cause they were going to be exposed on the far end of that. Right.

Speaker 6:          00:55:46       Wow. Yeah. So I, so everything that I did was planned out the night before check. Everything that I did was planned out the night before and it was all in our team. I mean, I told him, I mean, I told him, I said, you know, you say the word and I'll head in there. I don't care. I know I'm coming to get you. And um, I mean that w we had this all planned out. Like all they had to do was get to the road and I would be there

Speaker 4:          00:56:13       continuing on back to the book and the talk, a report about Ganja Gall had come in via brigade internet. A special forces team reported that 32 fighters, we're moving Pakistan to

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       reinforce God. Your Gall, half an hour later, the video feed from an unmanned aerial vehicle showed a man with a mortar tube on his back entering unknown, safehouse two kilometers north of conjugal village. 10 minutes later for more men entered the same house. So, so you're, you're watching this. So here's the crazy part. Nobody told us. Oh, so you didn't even get that report. Nobody told us.

Speaker 1:          00:56:48       Check. Um, and I got to point out to everyone, I'm, I'm obviously skipping giant chunks of this book and there's an awesome amount of detail that, that Dakota goes into in, in how this is going down. And I'm kind of hitting the wave tops to get to get the story there. But, uh, okay. You don't even get that Intel, but doesn't matter because the next day I guess where you're going into the valley, um, you got a guy with you named Swenson, he's in charge of some border police, some Afghan border police. Is that right? Yeah. So Swenson's border police turned to Hafez when the lights went out. Dutchman. He said, am I saying that right? Dutchman Dishman Douche man, which is another term for enemy for enemy douche man. They said we must turn back. So they're already freaking out. Yeah. Yeah. So they, I think I, uh, I think that they, they were, uh, why some of the police had already knew they had lead tipped it off.

Speaker 1:          00:57:44       Yep. They had had information one way or the other when we were coming in and they leaked the plan. Yeah. So I think that that's why they were trying to bail out, in my opinion, it was because they knew what was already there. Yeah. Got It. And um, just before five in the morning, rod and I heard gravel contract crunching on the trust. So now you're actually in position, you dropped off the guys and now, uh, the, the Afghan team with some of the advisors including team Monte are heading up the valley and you're waiting at the bottom end of the valley. I'm sitting back at the back of the trucks and they're going, you know, they're going into the valley and um, yeah, at this point now everybody's leaving the valley. Yeah. This, this part, just before five in the morning, rod and I heard gravel crunching on the trail. Men, women, children, sheep and goats suddenly hurried by our trucks heading out of the valley.

Speaker 5:          00:58:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:34       Predawn always brought the first sing song called a prayer followed by per people scurrying about. And, and this is just, you knew right then, right? Oh, a hundred percent no, 110% yeah. I mean, no doubt. So this, do you know, just for anyone that's listening that is important? Two and two together here, there's a village with a bunch of civilians in it and the civilians all leave and they take their animals with them. They take all their, they take everything that's worth, worth anything with him so they know that there's, it's on. Going back to the book as Lieutenant Johnson Approach, the first row of houses, he radioed back to Garza that he and lieutenant ruler, we're heading toward the house of an e mom, one of the village elders. Seconds later, an RPG street in from the east followed by a of PKM, a Russian

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       made machine gun that shoots a hefty 7.62 millimeter cartridge. It started tearing up the ground and the Adobe walls as the men took cover among the terrorist walls. More PKM fire came in from the northeast, joined by a k's at a closer range. Enemy fighters were crouched inside the houses and below the windows of the schoolhouse on the southern Ridge. They were hiding in the alleyways and dug in behind the stone terrorist walls to the east. They had a dozen fixed positions and we're shooting downhill with the sun behind them. Yeah. They know what they're doing. Yeah. This is, um, again, um, do any kind of anybody with any kind of military knowledge whatsoever. When you read that paragraph or that, that does two paragraphs right there, you see that you are not in a horrible, horrible scenario. Multiple enemy machine gun positions in elevated

Speaker 2:          01:00:16       coordinated attack. Yeah. Horrible.

Speaker 4:          01:00:22       And here's your thoughts back to the book. I waited for the firing to die down,

Speaker 2:          01:00:26       but it didn't.

Speaker 4:          01:00:29       The chaos of the RPG explosions, PKM machine guns [inaudible] and [inaudible] increased. I heard the report of a recoil less rifle, basically a hundred pounds shoulder or tripod mounted cannon and a sure sign of a plan. Damn Bush as a Douche. Men Don't lug that over the hills for an exercise. Then I heard the crump crump of their mortar shells. There was a wide babble of voices on the command radio advisers yelling at each other to clear the net. No one was taking charge. There was no central command. I was pacing around, frustrated, being out of the fight and not being able to help. So yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:01:04       seen enough of like little firefights that we'd be able to burst of fire and then people are going to run it by me know, like they're going to just see, they blow their load like right in the beginning and then you know, they don't have enough. Like they're not able to like us resupply, they don't sustain anything.

Speaker 2:          01:01:20       This was endless. And then yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:01:22       you mentioned this earlier and again just to kind of point out to people, so they, so they understand what you were talking about. You said Hey, there's going to be 14 different maneuver elements. A 12 yeah. 12 different maneuver elements and they're all on the same net. Now what that means is they're all in the same radio frequency. So picture this you, you're trying to have a conversation on the phone but so or 12 other people, 11 other people all trying to have a conversation on the phone at the same time. Yeah. With their, with their nerves, with their nerves while they're chaos is happening.

Speaker 2:          01:01:53       Yeah. And

Speaker 4:          01:01:55       so this is what you end up doing is actually on a phone you have a better chance because a phone, we'll kind of kind of let some of that traffic through, but when you start stepping on each other on the radio, it just cut each other off and you can't hear anything.

Speaker 3:          01:02:09       That's exactly what happened. And the other piece of it was it's not just that it was all that one frequency, everything had to be relayed through those snipers to get there. The elevated high ground

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       to get back to the, could you, did you have direct coms with the guys on the ground? Yes I did. But I'm saying like to get to the command like you know in the big thing I brought up was was you know what happens if you're calling it a med evac and you're calling in call for fire. Yeah, that's, that's like trying to call the fire department and the ambulance and, and you're trying to call him at the same time. Like you gotta you gotta separate them? Yes. Actually that's not a good example. It's trying to call the ambulance and it active shooter. And trying to maneuver all that stuff happening at the same time.

Speaker 2:          01:02:48       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:02:52       Back to the book soon. Both Ridge lines were sparkling with fire as the ass cars and Douche Min engaged each other with rocket propelled grenades. Smoking shrapnel filled the air.

Speaker 2:          01:03:05       MMM Swenson

Speaker 4:          01:03:07       ease. He's on. This is Highlander six he yelled over the Din Ford Ford Line of troops pinned down at x Ray Delta and heavy enemy fire request. Immediate cert suppression fire Kilo Echo will adjust. So he's trying to call fire your back and you and rod says, what do you think rod said if the Dishman caught around the rear, I said and close the back door. They'll catch our people in a fire sac. This is deep shit. They got to get out of there. The way to break up an ambush is to hammer it with heavy fire. The Humvee gave us armor mobility and a heavy gun. We would roll in and bring team Monte back to the location of the command group. I grabbed the radio and called Fox Fox three Lieutenant Fabio, no reply. I tried Fox six Williams and then Fox nine first Sergeant Garza. No one replied. I was calling for permission to enter the valley asking for it from anyone who would answer. Finally, Fox seven Valdez up on the northern Ridge answered on the net. Fox three three your request to enter the valley are denied. Fox Nine says you are to stay at your present location.

Speaker 2:          01:04:17       Okay,

Speaker 4:          01:04:18       and again, I'm throwing out a bunch of different names here. These are all the different leaders that are out there on these different 12 elements and when you read the book for yourself, you can kind of catch and, and understand exactly what was happening there. But the, the, the, basically what was going on was your calling to whoever would answer to get permission to drive up the valley and go give a hand. Yeah. Shine and get permission.

Speaker 4:          01:04:41       I put down the hand set and sat there listening as the does as a dozen advisors try to talk over a single radio channel. It was sheer bedlam. This is bullshit. Rod. I recheck the ammo belt and the Mark 19 rod sat in the driver's seat. You Ready, rod? Give it a few more minutes. Meyer, you'll fry for this. He said he was right, I'd get sent home for disobeying a direct order. There was no question in my mind about that. I was already on thin ice with Garza, Fabio and Williams. So I sat there frustrated listening to the shooting, flexing my hands on the grips of the mark 19 and breathing hard. I tried to calm down, maybe the battle sounded worse on the radio than it really son of a bitch inside the tactical operations center at joy. So Joyce is a couple miles away and the TAC or operation center is where they're running this.

Speaker 4:          01:05:27       There were supposed to have, um, kind of situational awareness of everything that's happening and they're supposed to be able to supply supply, fire support. So that's why when we're talking about the tactical operations center at Joyce, that's what it is. Captain Aaron Harding was the senior officer on duty from midnight to eight in the morning. The battle captain. He had been in Afghanistan for eight months but had rarely controlled fires and certainly not in certainly not unlike this as artillery stood by at Joyce a few miles away. Ended up [inaudible] a few miles away. Harding asked for more and more information from the men on the long table who was requesting the fire missions? Was it shadow for Highlander five or Fox three what did they heard from Fox six who is presently in charge? The marine advisors or the Afghan army. Did the ground commander know where all his troops were? Had they double check the grids of the k ease.

Speaker 5:          01:06:19       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:06:20       He asked question after question.

Speaker 5:          01:06:22       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:06:23       At Joyce, 120 millimeter millimeter mortars were fired for fired 15 minutes after Fabio requested. The first shell though struck within 50 meters of the enemy position. The next flurry of shells was on target. That would be the only effective fire mission of the entire day and this is one of the things that you're going to get more into. We actually recently talked about the, the battle in the, I drank valley and those guys would absolutely 100% have been overrun. And what saved their ass over and over again was artillery and fire support. Yeah. That's the biggest advantage that we have on the battlefield as Americans. 100% and your co and your team is calling for it. The advisors are calling for it and they're not getting it.

Speaker 3:          01:07:09       Yeah. We're not getting it. I mean, they shut it down and, and, and, and to, to try to give the benefit of the doubt here. Right. A of why they shut it down. I totally understand it, but it goes back to the one thing I said, right? I mean, they couldn't probably couldn't figure out who the hell was calling what and where, what was where. I mean, I don't know that I could've confidently fired around and, but part of it was because of the layout of everybody on one frequency, you know, it goes back to the initial problem. Like, I don't know if I could have fire round now I am. I am. I pissed that they didn't fire around. Absolutely. Like it was wrong. It was wrong for what the reasons they did it. But you know, I, I, the confusion was so chaotic in the beginning especially. Um, but I can tell you this, that if they had got the rounds,

Speaker 4:          01:07:55       it broke the enemy and you don't again to, to advance your point of giving the benefit of the doubt. If they have no idea where friendlies are, they could've fired rounds on friendly forces as well. Exactly. And then, you know, they'd have been accountable for that. And I'll tell you, that's, um, that's a hard to make to, to possibly, you know, fratricide blue on blue is, is in my opinion, that's the worst thing that happened in war. And so what these guys are being asked to possibly do is, is, is risk a fratricide yes. Which in their minds and most probably a lot of military minds, I think mine included. Well, it's hard to say what's better, you know, risk fratricide or risk, uh, getting overrun. Now if we know for a fact people are getting overrun, then you're like, okay, we'll risk fratricide. And that's why that happens sometimes where people say, dropped that bomb no matter what, but to say, I'm not 100% sure people are going to over run, but I'm still going to take the risk of fratricide at this point. That's probably why they're holding off it is in the beginning. Yeah. Yeah, and they get to a point where they call the danger close rounds and try and take responsibility and we'll, we'll get there.

Speaker 4:          01:09:10       Back to the book. The enemy above the neb above work their way around the edges of the valley shooting downhill. The Taliban machine gunners tracting on one ass car then another than another. It was a killing ground. They're all over the place. Swenson was thinking to himself, I may not make it out of here.

Speaker 5:          01:09:27       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:09:28       If you hunker down and don't shoot back, you will surely die. The other side gains confidence and rushes forward in the frenzy of combat soldiers act like sharks. They sense weakness and circle in picking off the wounded and the defenseless. Slowly the Douche men we're closing in from both sides of the wash, so they were ready.

Speaker 7:          01:09:49       Oh the, let me tell you something. They were good. They were good. They were trained that year. You know, they had, they had plate carriers. They are taking the uniforms off or a dead guys. Um, you know, they put Kev Lars on shit. They're good.

Speaker 4:          01:10:08       Still trying to get fire support here. Swenson. It identified enemy position to four grid positions. There are two basic ways of calling in artillery. You can give the grid coordinates of the target or the Kilo Echo number for a grid and adjust after the initial round or you can give your own location and a compass bearing to and distance to the target. The second technique is called a polar mission. Provides the guns with the locations of both the friendly observer and the target. Tell the talk. I'll send it. Polar Swenson. Radio de Kaplan. It's on me. Give them my initials. I'm making the decision, not them. Assuming accurate fire. The U s mortars were less than two miles away. The only target endangered by the polar plot was the enemy by sending his initial Swenson was taking full responsibility. If anything went wrong. If a friendly soldier or civilian were hit, the burden rested squarely on sweats and not with the talk in the rear. The talk responded to the polar request by asking again for information that was impossible to provide. Where were all the friendly troops? What was the forward line of trace of the friendly units? Was everyone accounted for? Were any civilians?

Speaker 2:          01:11:15       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:11:15       Kaplan told shadow the relay team above the him tell the talk. That's that. It's critical. I repeat critical. We have advisers pin down the talk. Denied shadows, fire mission, Furious Sergeant Summers at shadow for pressed back against the talk. The main element is being hit from the north, east and south. All elements are engaged. I repeat. All elements are heavily engaged. We need fire missions. Now. The NCO is inside the talk. We're doing their job and the artillery and mortar cruise wanted to oblige. Yet it seemed to sergeant summers that every time he relayed a fire mission to talk, ask him 20 questions. A second string was running the show here and not well.

Speaker 2:          01:11:57       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:11:58       In firefights. It's not unusual for 200 to 2000 artillery shells to be fired over the course of the first hour of the ballot. Ganja gall when men lay trapped and dying. The talk at Joyce allowed only 21 artillery shells to be fired.

Speaker 2:          01:12:15       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:12:17       Since World War II forward observers had received artillery fire. Under the rule of silence is consent when it observer called for fire. The mission went by radio to the operation center and to the guns. Silence by the ops center constituted consent for the guns to fire

Speaker 4:          01:12:35       and the 21st century with computers making instant firing calculations within two minutes shells could be hitting the target, but beginning about 2006 sergeants and lieutenants on the front lines, we're trusted less. The high command believed the grunts were too quick to call and fires that endangered civilians resulting in an embittered population that supported the insurgency. The solution was to apply a strict new rule. Two months before gone. De Gaulle, general Stanley McChrystal, the senior commander in Afghanistan issued a directive that forbade the use of artillery against or near any structure likely to contain civilians unless the higher, the next higher headquarters commander had approved that ended silence is consent. The high command had shifted decision making from the battlefield to the staff. Swenson was not trusted to make the hard decisions. Instead officer's in the talk with a confused idea of the battlefield had to decide whether to honor his requests for fire.

Speaker 7:          01:13:43       Yeah, I know it. So that's where my problem comes in, right. Is, you know, if the doctrine is that you, I give my initials, I take the responsibility, we'll then follow the doctrine. Yeah. You know, that's, there's, there's where they went

Speaker 4:          01:13:55       wrong. And I'll, I'll tell you something else that, you know, you talked about how confusing it was over the net and clearly it was obviously very confusing. How long would it take to verbally explain the layout of this whole, Oh,

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       it would take a very long time. It would take an extremely eloquent person who had the time to kind of compose himself and, and sit there and try and explain it. That's why you make Kate Key low echoes. That's why you have these preplanned fire positions so that you don't have to think anymore. We can direct fires and, and what instead of having to communicate what the situation on the ground is, what you communicate is this is what we need and this is where you need to put it. I mean, that's 100% in it. I mean, that's 100%. It is, you know, um, you could never first off you, you could never relay all the information there and guess what, at the end of the day, it was irrelevant to what they were needing to do it. And also by the time you, if you could relay it by the time you related, it would be different because what are you going to tell everyone to sit still for a minute while I explain where you are, that doesn't work. That's why, that's why decentralized command is so important on the battlefield. This is the exact reason why decentralized command is so important on the battlefield. When you centralized command people and the people that actually are there that need to be able to make decisions, make things happen, can't do it. Yup.

Speaker 5:          01:15:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:15:15       Um, and by the way, how do you overcome a situation like this? How do you overcome a situation where, okay, you're my subordinate, you work for me and I don't, I don't want you to be able to have the ability to fire because I'm afraid you're gonna hurt civilians. How do I solve that? The way to solve it is not to say no, I don't get that. You got Authority the way I solve it, as they say, okay, Dakota, let me explain some things to you. We need to protect the civilian populace. We need to make sure we don't damage any infrastructure to the best of our ability. I want you to understand how strategically important that is. Do you understand? Let me put you through some scenarios. What if you were here in this happened? What would you do? What if you're hearing this happened? What would you do? I train you and I build trust so that I can decentralize the command. That's how you overcome it. You don't overcome it. It's a shortcut to try and centralize and it ends up getting people killed. 100%

Speaker 5:          01:16:10       all right.

Speaker 1:          01:16:14       Going back to the book, Fox three one Lieutenant Johnson finally came up on the radio, were pinned down in a house receiving accurate fire from the next house. We have to get out of here. He was caught off by others pushing to use the same frequency. Three or four advisors. We're trying to talk, stepping on each other. I could hear the strain in their voices. The lack of Chris borders, the frantic yelling of men who were pinned down after a few minutes, Fox three to staff sergeant can affect, tried to pass his location on the grid to Fabio. I can't shoot back. Aaron said, because I'm pinned down there shooting at me from the house. It's so close. Grid three two. This is three three radio staff sergeant can affect, repeat your grid, repeat your grid or you. You radioed to Kenefick. Repeat your grid. Repeat your grid. So he faded as he was trying to tell you is grid nothing after that but static in garbled voices that broke it for

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       me. I had promised my team I would be there as far as I was concerned. My command element wasn't in command

Speaker 4:          01:17:26       twice. I had heard shadow say that air would be on station in 15 minutes. Nothing happened. How long do you do nothing while your friends are fighting for their lives? Fox seven this is three. Three sitting here is stupid. We're going in. Rod and I were on the net with Valdez. There was no dispute among us. It was about zero 600 time to move. I was the vehicle commander so the fault lay with me for disobeying orders. If I arrived in the valley and discovered that the command group had had the situation under control, I knew there was a good chance I'd be sent back to the states and disgrace. When I shouted the ask ours to follow us. They look confused up on the north outpost. Valdez grabbed a senior Afghan sergeant, the sergeant radio to the Afghan drivers clustered around our truck, urging them and past due to follow me, mortar shells were falling a football field away to our west. The enemy knew our trucks were somewhere on the path, but uncertain just where the explosions made my made the askers jumpy, just the same. Some of them jumped into two Humvees and roared in a position behind us. Rod, let's go. I said he put it in gear.

Speaker 4:          01:18:35       Now. By that time you start actually going into the valley and as you're going in, by that time several NASCAR's, we're stumbling out of the battlefield. Some bleeding, a few without the rifles, all exhausted where Americani I yell, dose dose, the ass cars pointed up toward the village. So, so as you're driving in your scene, guys fleeing the battlefield, I mean it was like, it was terrible. Like is we go in and you, you're just seeing these guys come out and it's in Ramadan so they won't eat or they won't drink any water and they're coming out of this battle and they're just like, you're not even close to the valley yet, and they're coming out as battle. They don't have any weapons on them. They're just broken. Their bloodied there, there been shot. They've just, I mean, you're carrying each other and you're just like,

Speaker 5:          01:19:21       okay,

Speaker 4:          01:19:22       what are we going into? Somewhere behind us was a u s army platoon. It seemed to me to be a time for them to make a move. They were the quick reaction force. Our Insurance Policy Valdez was on the radio argument with dog three six the quick reaction. Army platoon commander dog-free six this is Fox seven Valdez radio radioed you need to get in there man. Fox, three threes to your front in a Humvee drive east until you link up with him. Fox seven this is dark three six at the lieutenant. Our vehicles are too big for the mission.

Speaker 5:          01:19:55       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:19:56       We were driving on a footpath. I was barely wide enough for our home. The Valdez came up with an alternative dog-free six. This is Fox seven. I understand. Drive forward until you reach the Afghan vehicles. Use them to get into the fight. There are people out there dying. The platoon leader said he had to wait for clearance from the talk at Joyce.

Speaker 5:          01:20:13       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:20:16       What kind of vehicles did the QRF after an MRI. APPS. Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:20:21       No

Speaker 4:          01:20:25       God, I mean me excuse. Yeah. How awesome would it be to have an m wrap? Roland did this situation with and I don't think they could have the road. Wouldn't tell it to small. Yeah. Cause they ended up coming in and one of those, uh, it looks like a tank but it's on wheels and it ended up flipping over often off the bank. But they look at the end of the day, we had a ton of Humvees, women, we just brought in 90 people sitting right there. They could have jumped in the Humvees and came.

Speaker 5:          01:20:54       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:20:54       The helicopter ops center called back saying the re tasking of the birds had been canceled because lance had not called his own brigade headquarters to ask permission. And because another mission north of Ganja Gall was of higher priority. So one of the guys in the, in the ops center had actually said, you know what? Screw it, I'm calling for calling for kilos. And he, but he hadn't called the brigade and run through the proper chain of command and they, they shut him down.

Speaker 5:          01:21:20       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:21:24       So here we go. More than an hour into the fight, the situation was as follows, team Monte was trapped in a house in the u s and Afghan commanders were pinned down by shooters closing in on them from three sides.

Speaker 5:          01:21:37       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:21:37       The North and south observation posts were under fire. The ass cars were caught in the open with nowhere to hide. Rod and I hadn't reached the wash. The one, three, two quick reaction platoon was not quick reacting. The talk at Joyce was paralyzed, preventing artillery support and the helicopter gunships had not arrived. It was a perfect storm.

Speaker 5:          01:22:06       Damn.

Speaker 4:          01:22:10       That's just, um, there's absolutely nothing else. Go wrong right now. It's a perfect storm is the absolute perfect storm.

Speaker 5:          01:22:24       Okay?

Speaker 4:          01:22:24       Swenson wanted a massive artillery barrage because the Douche man didn't have overhead cover. Artillery. Air Bursts would send millions of lance. It's raining down toward them. Hundreds of shells had to shake the mountains and roll funder down the valley. The douche, man, we're zealots, but they weren't crazy. Once artillery began exploding overhead, gunman with eight K's wouldn't get up and run forward in the open. Yet the talk refused to fire it gone. Juggalo me a few miles from Camp Joyce on leasing a barrage in your own backyard wouldn't win any applause at higher headquarters. The directive from the high command was so clear. Do not employ air to ground or indirect fires against compounds

Speaker 1:          01:23:05       to as any structure or building known or likely to contain civilians. Unless the ground force commander has verified that no civilians are present.

Speaker 6:          01:23:23       Sarah and I mean, you know, and there's that. You know that rule right there is Britain so impossible. You know what do you do? [inaudible] mean the village you're getting shot at. So you run through there, you civilian. Are you shooting me?

Speaker 2:          01:23:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:23:40       You know, um, I'd have to look do like a full review of the Rois or this Pacific der Directive. But you know, normally the self defense thing trumps everything.

Speaker 6:          01:23:50       Well, usually, and that's what I always say, right. I always talk about Roe is, and you know, Ryes we'll say, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Within, at the end of it, it always ends, it says, or hostile act, hostile intent. [inaudible] but it's all by interpretation. I mean, it goes back to the commanders. I mean, you know, I don't blame the Rov that Stanley McChrystal put in place for what happened that day. I blame the people, the leadership who was incompetent to make a decision. You know what I mean? Like, like, it's like nobody wants to just own it and take accountability and take responsibility and say, you know what, I'm doing this because it's the right thing to do. They want to be able to say, well, I didn't do it because, well, this is the order. Come on, come on. You know, if you're in a leadership position to take, take responsibility.

Speaker 1:          01:24:46       Yeah. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:24:50       yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:24:50       You got to do the right thing. That's the bottom line. And that's what makes leadership hard. And sometimes the right thing is to break rules. Sometimes the right thing is to not follow orders. Sometimes orders are wrong and you shouldn't follow him. And Napoleon said, if you, if you're in charge and you get tasked with something that's wrong and you execute it, you're culpable. It doesn't matter if you get ordered or not.

Speaker 2:          01:25:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:25:14       Sometimes you break the rules going right back to the yes man. Thick, right? Yeah. And I guarantee, I guarantee the intent of Stan McChrystal putting this roe in place wasn't to deny guys that were pinned down by enemy fire. But again, how are we communicating it and are we putting, so we put in the para priorities in place correctly so that everybody knows.

Speaker 6:          01:25:38       Yeah. I mean, you know, um, when it's put out in an email, it's kind of like, it's as dangerous as you interpreting me a text. I mean, everybody looks at different. Yup.

Speaker 2:          01:25:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:25:55       And you know what, that's why things like commander's intent are so important. If I know what it is, like your eye, if I what it is that you want

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       done and my job is to get it done and you give me parameters to do it within. I'll stay within those parameters and I'll get the job done.

Speaker 5:          01:26:10       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:26:11       And I'll come back to you and say, Hey boss, I had to, I had to bend the rules a little bit here, but I got the mission done. Or I might call you back and say, Hey, I'm getting ready to break the rules to get the mission done. Do you want me to break them or not?

Speaker 5:          01:26:22       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:26:23       Yeah. All right. Back to the book. Shadow the army outpost on the southern Ridge replied that the talk at Joyce said the fire mission was too close to the village, too close to the village. Lieutenant Johnson said, if you don't give me these rounds right now, I'm gonna die.

Speaker 5:          01:26:47       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:26:47       try your best shadow replied knowing the talk wouldn't fire. Try your best. Try your best.

Speaker 5:          01:27:01       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:27:03       From the tone of shadows voice, I knew he was on the verge of complete rage.

Speaker 4:          01:27:08       He wanted to strangle the officer's in the talk at Joyce. I felt the same way. This couldn't be happening. We were on the same side. We weren't marines or soldiers, we weren't Americans or ask ours. We were one lone group fighting desperately to stay alive. The villages villagers weren't our friends. This was a war and my team was on the verge of dying. Who side was the talk on radio call after radio call? Swinson kept requesting smoke. Finally around zero six 30 the talk at joy's permitted for white phosphorus, white phosphorus rounds to be fired into the southeast backside of the village too far away to conceal my team.

Speaker 5:          01:27:48       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:27:49       Those were the last rounds fired during the battle that about zero six 40 the talk at Joyce for obeyed any more artillery support, citing garbled communications in complete calls for fire procedures and a lack of situational awareness on the part of those trapped in the valley.

Speaker 5:          01:28:11       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:28:12       So there's the, there's the reasons from their perspective. MMM.

Speaker 5:          01:28:18       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:28:18       Garbled communications in complete calls for fire procedures and a lack of situational awareness on the part of those trapped in the valley.

Speaker 5:          01:28:29       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:28:35       Meanwhile, during this time you've been moving up, grabbing bodies, coming back.

Speaker 5:          01:28:39       Yep.

Speaker 4:          01:28:41       And here we go again as we move forward for a third time to talk and find the ordered the army platoon dog three to to move forward. They pulled in behind us with the platoon leader in a Humvee with an anti tank tow missile on the roof. The toe made no sense to me, but the truck was equipped with a to 40 machine gun behind them were 20 us soldiers and for heavily, heavily armored vehicles. You Rolling with me, lieutenant? I was confirming what I took for granted. I'll scout the route first before I bring my platoon in. The terrain may be too tough. He refused to put his soldiers into the Afghan vehicles. I could understand that. Okay. I go first. I said, you cover our six, the Afghans, we'll be behind you as we bounced forward. I heard teen Monte again come up on the radio. We were under fire. Lieutenant Johnson said we're surrounded. So now you're heading back in. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:29:35       Yeah. And I, um,

Speaker 7:          01:29:37       and my whole goal was just to get them, you know, was to get them to the road

Speaker 5:          01:29:42       and uh, yeah, I mean that was their goal.

Speaker 7:          01:29:48       Can you get to the road? They can get into the vehicles are good. It's always trying to push. I thought that they had took over a house. Right? Like I thought they had pushed into the village and took over a house and pointed a house and that's what I thought they had done. And I lost, I lost communications with them. So I thought they'd done, you know, when a Kenefick was trying to give that grid, I was trying to write it down cause I knew if I could get that grid, I'd know where they were at a plot and I could be there and go get him. And um, you know, the, the one part I don't talk about it and there is probably the hardest parts of the whole deal is, is that the first trip that I made in,

Speaker 5:          01:30:30       okay.

Speaker 7:          01:30:31       I was probably 70, 60 to 70 meters from him. They're still alive.

Speaker 4:          01:30:59       So you're out in the valley now

Speaker 4:          01:31:04       you're with a group of guys are going back to the bulkier up bullet had entered a Westbrook's neck near the shoulder blade and ricocheted downward. A Dang a dangerous but not fatal. Wound Swenson applied quick clot powder and a bandage to seal off the bleeding. The fight had been raging for over 90 minutes and the chain of command throughout Kunar province was on alert procedures for releasing helicopters had been on snarled and two oh h 58 Kai was, we're in route to the valley at zero seven 15 ne contacted Swenson Highlander. This is Pale horse. The PC pilot command radioed, what do you need? Pale horse. Swanson replied, I'm under heavy fire from the village and the hills to the east and on both sides. Request immediate suppression of while we pulled back the Kai Kai was squadron, had been in Coonara for 10 months. The pilot's knew the terrain and the enemy habits.

Speaker 4:          01:31:53       They intended to swoop in low and crisscrossing. Strafing room runs deliberately swerving and cutting back at odd. They didn't care whether they hit the Douche man, they wanted to force them to crouch down and cease firing. The aerial tactics would allow the command group to pull back westward to draw down under under reduced enemy pressure. As Swenson moved, he called for a medivac shadow. Radioed back to that. The talk wanted questions answered before calling for one. Is he army or marine shadow said Swinson cursed major Williams was more diplomatic. This is Fox w six Williams radioed it doesn't matter his service, he's us. There was a pause then shadow. Reluctantly radioed repeat talk needs to know if he's army or marine. It's in the regulations.

Speaker 7:          01:32:47       Yeah, it was um,

Speaker 4:          01:32:50       guy calling for medivac and you're getting asked, hey, is the person that needs, is the casualty army or Marine Corps?

Speaker 7:          01:32:58       Yeah. And it really didn't matter to him. It really did matter to them. You're saying it mattered. I'm saying it to who was asking. They really, their decisions were based off of who it was.

Speaker 4:          01:33:20       All right. Um, at this point you're, you're, I think you're, you're going back and forth, going back to the valley, getting bodies, helping wounded. Coming back out. You're under fire the whole time rod is getting after it with you. Sometimes you have some us people with you, sometimes you don't. And again, these are things you have to buy this book and it to get these details out of it and read it so you understand the full magnitude of what we're talking about here.

Speaker 5:          01:33:51       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:33:52       Going back to the book, Hafez left the command group to sort itself out helping a wounded NASCAR was headed back west to the operational release point when I had stopped him. I need you to come back in with me. I can't find them without you. I said Hafez was married recently. He was wounded and exhausted. He could now go home and have a life.

Speaker 5:          01:34:14       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:34:15       If today is my time to die, then I die. So He's rolling with you?

Speaker 7:          01:34:21       He did. He wrote with me the whole time

Speaker 4:          01:34:24       again to all those people out there that, well I guess I should just say for the people out there that have a hard time understanding of what's going on overseas, um, you know, here's an Afghan soldier that is now going to risk his life to help an American marine go and find his friends.

Speaker 7:          01:34:48       Yeah. Cause we were brothers.

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       Going back to the book shortly after we had it again down the valley, we bumped into another group of rent wounded, ask scars. Rod recognize the first sergeant who was dripping blood down the right side of his trousers. He was waving his arms, be begging us to stop for askers, hobbled over and threw themselves into the backseat, splashing blood all over the place. We drove them back to the collection point. The first sergeant was blubbering beg, begging us not to go back in. I was a little rough shoving him out of the truck. I was running out of time and patients, once we drop them off, we'd gunned it back down the track.

Speaker 5:          01:35:35       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:35:38       We were getting to a place where we couldn't turn around and couldn't dodge and weave the art as the RPG smoke trails came at us. We could get pretty stuck in here. Rod yelled the truck, had very little traction and absolutely no cover then I guess we'll die with them. I yelled back, what else could I say that we weren't going back. Rod shifted into low gear and we bounced forward.

Speaker 5:          01:36:07       You,

Speaker 4:          01:36:08       I noticed this throughout the book, you have a hard time. Like anytime you saw wounded guys who were like, all right, well we gotta make another trip now we've got to make another trip. Even with those wounded Afghan guys, like you want to go help your guys. But at the same time you see these guys here like are getting the truck and we'll take these guys back. Oh, you've got a big heart, bro. Got a big heart.

Speaker 6:          01:36:26       I mean look, you know, I didn't just lose, um, I didn't just lose a four guys that day. I lost 10 guys cause I lost six Afghans. I lost 10 brothers. You know what I mean? I mean, those guys were just as close to me. My Afghans were just as close to me as any marines I ever served with,

Speaker 4:          01:36:53       and that's why they're joining you to go back in there and fight

Speaker 6:          01:36:55       the ethics and that's why I'm alive today. I mean that's, that's the relationship that I had with them and the Brotherhood that I had for them with them is why I'm alive today. I mean they, they are incredible human beings.

Speaker 4:          01:37:18       So you're driving around in here. Back to the book. Only rod scale at the wheel was preventing me from being hit again and again. Bullets make different sounds when they pass by you. The cracks of bullets breaking the sound barrier mean they're high, maybe five or 10 feet over your head. The bullets at snap close by your ears are the real killers. A few losing power and slowing down made a low buzzing sound. Strange though it may seem I wasn't scared or angry. I was beyond that. I didn't think I was going to die. I knew I was dead. There wasn't anything I could do about it. I wasn't a thinking human being. I had gone, I wasn't firing the machine gun, I was the machine gun. Rod wasn't driving the truck. Rod was the truck. I had melded with my weapon. I was no more human than a five foot machine gun. I was embracing, we were locked together, metal and flesh. Without that 50 gal, I would have quivered like the ha ha, scars helpless in the storm. But with that weapon, I felt transported. I had something to do until the blackness came.

Speaker 6:          01:38:28       Yeah. He just kept, I kept like the bullets were hitting inside the tourists. They had elevation on us and still they were hidden inside the turret. And um, man, you could hear him coming by and I just, I remember sitting there, you know, cause if you get down, I mean, you know, you, you know, your, your instinct is to duck down the turret, but you do that delve around you. I mean, they were running at the truck, so yup. You ducked down there full sprint and you're never going to come back up. You know what I mean? And, um, I just kept waiting for a bullet. I just knew it was who's going to hit me in the face. I just kept waiting for a bullet to hit me lights out like I just, I just, there was no doubt in my mind that I was going to die zero c road out, but I was going to make this son of a bitches, aren't it?

Speaker 2:          01:39:20       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:39:21       They had it to do Jack.

Speaker 4:          01:39:31       I wasn't paying attention to the Afghan soldiers. Rod and I plan to keep driving east until we obliterated, until we were obliterated or we found my team suddenly with no warning, five or six ass cars who were lying in a terrorist about off a hundred meters away, leapt up and race towards our truck when wish one was shot back and pitched forward. Wham. A second man went down screaming, Wham, a third, then a fourth and a fifth. I'd never seen anything like it. Five men down in five seconds. There was so much screeching and shooting that I could, couldn't pick out the location of a weapon that had shot them to deliver such lethal grazing fire. The machine gunner must been hidden only a few hundred meters away with a clear line of sight and his bi-pod firmly anchored. Yet whoever shot those men didn't raise his gun sights and stitch me. I knew he was looking at me, but I couldn't see him. There was nothing I could do. He let me live, not one of his rounds even struck our truck. I can't explain it. W W we used to call the truck's bullet magnets. They are, I mean it's like the ripest target and a free gear. The Turret gunner. You're like the, the, the icing on the cake. You're the chocolate.

Speaker 6:          01:40:37       The Cherry on the icing on the cake. Yeah. Cause that truck gets over. If they take the gun out, that truck doesn't come out of their own silver ran. Oh hell yeah. Yeah. But you know, even though it's a bullet magnet, I mean, you know, just like right there, I think that kind of paints the picture. I mean it's the, it's the only chance you have, right? I mean you're, you're out. I mean, that's how doubting they are. It's, it's

Speaker 4:          01:41:03       literally watching guys see people throw the term miracle around. Yeah, all the time. Like the fact that you right here, there's five guys within, you know, spitting distance from you and they all go down and you're the most prime target and you and you don't get job in

Speaker 6:          01:41:19       helpless. The most helpless feeling you got is watching guys trying to get to you and just getting mowed down. I mean, you want to talk about helpless and you don't even know where it's coming from. I mean, you want to talk about helpless is watching another human being run directly at you to get help and you're just watching them just go down one after the other after the other.

Speaker 4:          01:41:57       Can you imagine it dude? Yeah. It's just the, you know, I'd say they were good that day.

Speaker 4:          01:42:05       You get this call from Valdez, they're coming at you. I can see them closing from both sides. They're swarming, you know, in front of our truck, I saw few guys sprinting across the washed from left to right, heads low. I don't think they saw us coming up behind them or if they heard the truck engine over the din of the gunfire. They scurry too quickly for me to get off a burst. Glancing to my right, I'd looked smack into the eyes of five or six men in dirty man dresses, crouched alongside a drainage ditch, not 10 meters away. When I gave them, they ducked down like they were playing hide and seek. It took me a few seconds to realize that they were spreading out to seal off the open end of the Horseshoe Valley Zip locking the frozen as scars inside a fire sac. Rod and I had blundered into their rear, so they were about to, they're about to surround everybody. That's what they were doing. There was a trench and they were closing it. They're closing the gate and we that truck, you happened to be there to be in it. Fire Sac is a, is a doctrinal term actually, which means you're surrounded and they're going to shoot into the sack and kill everyone.

Speaker 5:          01:43:10       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:43:13       We are bouncing over the rocks no faster than a man can run. When a bearded Douche man clutching an AK leapt out of a ditch and sprinted after us like a man trying to catch is a catch a bus. My gun almost wouldn't swivel low enough to shoot him. The barrel was tilted down as far as it could go. I fired into his chest and he went down like you'd hit a glass wall. The bullet doesn't blow a man back like in the movies. Either he stumbles or on or he falls dead. This man fall, fell dead. Rod was yelling at me. Maybe I was hypnotized for a second. By the death, there was a guy trying to open the right door. I couldn't depress the 50 cal bat low. I can't get him. I yelled, the gun won't go down low enough. It takes the brain 12 thousands of a second to react to danger. My mind was a complete blank. I had fired so many thousands of rounds that I didn't think what I was doing. Once you've practiced emotion long enough, it becomes second nature. Some reachers researchers call it expertise induced amnesia. Athletes Call it being in the zone. I call it self preservation. I grabbed my m four leaned out and shot the guy four or five times in the shoulder and neck. It was like shooting a Zombie. There was no shock power and the little five five six millimeter bullets. He felt the ground.

Speaker 4:          01:44:26       I pivoted back to the 50 Callen, grabbed the spade, handle the weapon, my hands and my eyes were working as a trained unit independent on my brain, man. Sight, picture, shoot, man. Sight picture shoot. You don't really look at the target. The enemy remains out of focus. You concentrate on the sight picture, man. Sight picture shoot. I hit one or two guys next to the truck and the other's duck back into the ditch. Valdez came back on the Radio Rod, watch your front. Rod was focused on keeping traction in the loose gravel. If the truck got stuck, even for a moment, we'd be toast. He looked ahead to see a bearded hatless man in his mid thirties dressed in a brick red man, jams with a green chest rig full of ammo running toward the truck and firing an eight k at us from the hip. Hold on, homie. Rod Yelled, he hit the accelerator, the truck at the man squarely in the chest. There was a bump and then another bump under the tires. Holy Shit, Rod rod yelled. I just ran over a guy back up and do it again. I had been shot in the elbow, a bleeder that did no real damage. The bone was fine in a fight. Adrenaline deadens the pain. I did a little rapping. It got back to shooting. The more fucked up things got the more rod and I started laughing.

Speaker 4:          01:45:41       He was steering away from RPG streaming at us and laughing and I was shooting the big gun and laughing. Definitely crazy, but your emotions have to go somewhere.

Speaker 2:          01:45:51       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:45:51       The enemy fire slack and on us. As the Chi was darted around, they were like a steel umbrella over us. A few minutes later, Pale horse came back on my net. Three three were Winchester. We'll be back in 15 Mike's Winchester meant they'd expended all their ammunition. They were too light to carry much and they'd been shooting at targets wherever they looked. The firing picked up. We were again, the pin, Yada. I climbed down from the Turret and talk to talk to Rod and Hafez. We had started with six ammo cans. We are now down to one. I had fired more than 2000 rounds. Guys, we need a new gun. I said it was three steps forward, two steps back. As we turned, I saw and ask our free crawling feebly toward the road. We stopped and I hopped out a PKM machine. Gun was tilling the ground around me, so I dodged back and forth until I reached him. One Kiowa out of ammo hovered above me and distracted the enemy. Ignoring the RPG shells exploding in the air. I turned the asker onto his back, hit by three rounds in his upper chest and neck. He was gurgling and drowning in his own blood.

Speaker 4:          01:46:53       I rolled him onto his side and he died before I could pick them up.

Speaker 2:          01:47:03       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:47:08       Yeah. Like

Speaker 4:          01:47:10       you can see I kind of circle things that I'm going to read. Yeah. And I just was like circling giant chunks. Yeah, too. So people can understand what I mean. I, I know that people aren't going to understand really the, the kind of chronological evolution and maybe the mechanics of what was happening, but I want people at least understand until they read this book themselves to freaking situation that you were in, which was beyond mayhem.

Speaker 7:          01:47:35       Yeah. You know, you talk about training and life to the worst case scenario. I always had done the same thing. And this was worst than any worst case scenario that I could have ever, ever dreamed up of. I've ever been in. There was the worst of any situation I could have never sit here. And you said, gimme the worst thing you could just come up with. And I could have never done it. I could've never, I could have never done it, uh, of just, I mean, you just, I mean it's just like, I mean, I just felt like everybody was dying. Like, I mean it was just, I mean, there were like literally there were bodies everywhere, Eh, Eh, I mean you couldn't turn around and look and are not be a body somewhere.

Speaker 2:          01:48:27       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:48:28       And you just pretty much figured you were going to be joining them soon enough.

Speaker 7:          01:48:33       No, I did. I mean, there was no doubt. There was no doubt in my mind. I wasn't making it out of there. And you know, I walked in that day and this just shows you how ignorant I was. Like when you talk about, oh, your buddy who was kind of like, puff the chest up, right. I had that with me. I literally, I'm a, I'm going to tell you, I'm going to just tell you how ignorant I was. I walked in that day and I, I, I, there was not a situation that I was ever going to see that I couldn't get us out of. There wasn't one, there wasn't one. And it was like, you know, it was like God showing me just how small it was. No, you got to take, I mean, these, these Afghan soldiers, I mean they're my buddies, you know, and part of the problem, what was the long and the deployment, was this supposed to been nine months and how long this, when did this happen? We got there in July. August. September. Yeah. So this is like two months or three months into deployment. Yeah. And I'm, part of the problem was we'd just done the

Speaker 3:          01:49:47       NATO transition and they were using weapons systems that they weren't used to that shoot a smaller round. Yeah. Yeah. A lot. But they weren't used to these weapons. They weren't even used him for us. I mean, I knew him for us are so much more fickle. M 16th and six [inaudible] six things are even more so than an m four m six things are so much more fickle than an hey k they must've been cursing them. Damn. May 16th they were, I mean, they were, oh yeah. I mean they, you know, that they would have something go wrong and they would just drop the magazine. I mean, I mean they were just,

Speaker 2:          01:50:27       yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:50:28       so there is, so like I'm telling you if you say everything like we had just so we just hit Ramadan, so none of them were drinking water. None of them were eaten. We had just, I mean, you look at every factor to this. It was the perfect storm and we had just transitioned. This is the first mission at first or second mission that we had ever went on with all NATO weapons. I mean, you look at all these factors and it was, it was perfect. Had you ever worked with the QRF before? Not that one. I was used to the ones, you know, up near where we were at. Do you hadn't had done no interoperability with those guys before? No. And uh, they got shut down. So after the talk, learn that it was marines, they got shut down, all support stopped. All sports stopped. Cool.

Speaker 2:          01:51:28       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:51:29       All right. Um, Tom Toms, I got nothing to say and that's one of them. I can't even comprehend that.

Speaker 2:          01:51:41       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:51:45       All right. We're going back to the book. We turned left out of the wash onto the narrow track. Back to the casualty collection point. I looked around for major Williams. He was sitting off to one side, wounded in in shock. There were four or five vehicles and at least 20 ass cars milling around. These were our Afghans. We'd come down from Monte together. I glanced hopefully from the group, from group to group. Hafez was asking if they'd seen Lieutenant Johnson. They say lieutenant is back in Ganja Golf. How fast said the team didn't make it out.

Speaker 2:          01:52:14       Shit.

Speaker 4:          01:52:16       Somewhere farther up the wash. My team was fighting to stay alive. I'd promise to get them and rod and I had the only gun truck willing to enable to go in. I climbed down from the Turret and ran over to the asker. He'd taken a bullet in the fight and he was slowly bleeding out. I kept a stack of tourniquets in my med and knew how to apply them. I wrapped a tourniquet around his thigh and my frustration. I twisted it extra tight and he screamed. How tell him to up. I said hurting is better than dying. If you're a grunt, you'll come face to face with horrendous Gore. You have to steel yourself to seeing mangled bodies and smelling blood. Doctors and nurses cope with screaming and suffering every day. I had dressed out dozens of deer. You learn to disassociate from the task when you're pulling out warm guts are cutting off slabs of dripping, meet with the blood, sticking to your hands. He went through something like 15 tourniquets.

Speaker 6:          01:53:15       Yeah. At least quite a few vowels and morphine.

Speaker 5:          01:53:20       MMM.

Speaker 6:          01:53:21       A couple of neat needle decompressions.

Speaker 5:          01:53:24       MMM.

Speaker 6:          01:53:27       NPA is quite a few NPH nasal.

Speaker 5:          01:53:34       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:53:35       The quiet. The Chi was at rearmed and come back on station directing us toward another wounded. Like it or not, we had been pressed into ambulance business. The Kiowa commanded by chief warrant officer. Yes. Syrian Salono, a good name for guide. A crazy war had been a marine grunt before becoming an army pilot. His bird was easy to talk to and he directed me where to go sometimes hovering so low I could just about reach up and touch his skids. He was covering my rear area. When I got out of the truck, the pilots were fearless knowing my team was lost. They were running search patterns 20 feet off the ground so they could identify each body.

Speaker 6:          01:54:15       Damn. Yeah. I mean, and he did that like, you know, they were so his commander, he was having problems with his commander and the guy who was leading those birds, you know, cause they fly in two birds and a fill the, but when I told him that it was marines missing, he dropped down and covered me the whole time. You ever meet him? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's incredible. I just seen him, um, I seen him like around thanksgiving. Yeah. He is an incredible human being.

Speaker 4:          01:54:48       Just so everyone knows like just cause you're in a helicopter does not make you safe at all. Especially a Kiowa. Like maybe you're a little bit safer and Apache cause you got some armor. I don't know how much, how much orders in a Kiowa. Zero. Right. They look like little

Speaker 6:          01:54:59       and I don't know how many he is. Bird was shot to shit. No kidding. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was shot to pieces.

Speaker 5:          01:55:12       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:55:13       I climbed up a terrorist wall and followed the contours, the field around a corner to find a body lying face down on the man's hands were green gloves with the fingers cut. I knew before I even rolled him over that it was Daud Ali, my closest Afghan friend. He was due to take leave in a few weeks. He had left on bad terms with his mother who was sure he would be killed. Finally, after two years, she had relented and invited him back to the farm for a visit. He'd been hit in the face. When looked at his dole lies. I lost my concentration and knelt there for a moment, oblivious. He was a little guy too small for his body armor. He and I had rigged up two tourniquets to hold the body armor in place close to his chest. I knelt down to untie the tourniquets. I needed them for other guys and I needed to get the heavy armor off him so I could carry him to the truck.

Speaker 4:          01:56:09       I felt a tap as something hit my left shoulder. It didn't register at first. It was like I'd been hit with a Lightstone. I glanced up to see a tough looking Afghan with a long black beard. Glatt glaring down at me. He was wearing a dirty gray man dress, a flak jacket, and an Afghan Hornby helmet. He was pointing an AK at my head, gesturing for me to stand up in broken English. He was telling me to drop my rifle, come. He said, waving the barrel of his eight K in my face. I couldn't believe that I'd screwed up so badly. All I could think of was that my head would be sawed off and held up on TV.

Speaker 2:          01:56:50       No Way.

Speaker 4:          01:56:52       I die right where I was right now. I had been dead for a few hours. Anyways, the borrowed time was up. That's all my rifle was resting on my left thigh, pointing in his direction. The stubby grenade launcher was attached to the underside of the barrel. I raised one arm like I was going to surrender and pulled the trigger of the launcher with my free thumb. The 40 millimeter grenades shot forward two feet to his armored vest. It didn't explode. Instead it knocked him back, stunned him with the, with the breath slammed out of him. He staggered back and fell on his side for a few seconds. I thought the blow had killed him. No such luck. I pushed myself erect as I pushed myself a he June, a big breath and stirred. I kicked out his face, losing my balance and falling on top of him. We were both on the ground wrestling.

Speaker 4:          01:57:40       Afghan tribesman have legs like steal from climbing mountains all day all their lives. So I had to keep his legs off me. I pinned his elbows and blocked. His reach for is eight K. I was pushing my helmeted head into his chest so he couldn't gouge my eyes any second. I figured that grenade would explode and both of us could stop worrying about any of this. I called the ground with my right hand and found a rock the size of a baseball. I clutched it and swung by blindly at his face. The blow stunned him before he could recover. I Pour, pushed off of his chest, lifted the rock high and my right fist and smashed it down like a hammer, breaking his front teeth. He looked me in the eyes, the fight knocked out of him, his head not moving. We both knew it was over. I drew back my arm and drove the stone down, crushing his left cheekbone. He went limp. I pushed up on my knees and I hit him with more force. The blow caved in the left side of his forehead. I smashed his face again. And again, driven by pure animal rage.

Speaker 1:          01:58:53       That's close combat obviously when you're killing another human being with a rock.

Speaker 5:          01:58:58       Yeah. Yeah. It's real. Um,

Speaker 7:          01:59:09       you know, I just, I just remember his face, you know, and uh, I mean, look, God, let me just state this up front. First off, I feel no remorse at all. Um, but I think it was at, it was at that, at that point to where it humanized it. Does that make sense? Like, it humanized

Speaker 7:          01:59:32       the fact of taking another person's life, like out. Remember the look in his eyes when he knew he was gonna die. And at that point, like, you know, I obviously I didn't think of it then, but you know, when I still see that face, I still think about, you know, he was a father. There was somebody at home that wanted him to come home just as bad as somebody wanted me to come home. Um, you know, whether you agree with his beliefs are not, people don't agree with their beliefs and you know, but at the end of the day, he believed in his beliefs just as much as I did. Um, we're both human beings. We're both fighting for a cause that neither one of us can see that we both just believe in. Um, and it had to be one of us

Speaker 1:          02:00:17       in my guesses, and you can, maybe I'm wrong, but my guess is the reason he didn't just straight kill you is because you had, you had the drop on you. Yeah. And, and, and having you as a trophy in an orange jumpsuit would've have been much more impactful for him and their costs. Yeah. I mean, he could have easily, um, it would have took him no time to get me across the border. We were right on the border. That's what he would've done. He would've took me across the board. He just told me, um, and he would have been a hero. He'd probably been promoted and whatever, you know, network he was in. I mean, he would have been the man and, um, I was worth a lot more to him alive than I was dead. And I, you know, but, but then on the backside, I mean, I've questioned it so many times, like, you know, it was it that or was it the maybe maybe he was trying to bluff me, didn't have bullets to me. I don't know. I don't, I don't know. Like, and you know, there's so many times in this whole battle that I just wonder like,

Speaker 7:          02:01:11       like, why, why, why not me,

Speaker 1:          02:01:16       you know, uh, I mean, war and I gets, you could apply this to all life, but it becomes very clear at war, it's like inches, millimeters. You know what, what? Sure. You could say he got missed by, by around by a foot a couple of inches. But when you take that back to a person's weapon, you got missed by a millimeter a of aim. That's what it is.

Speaker 6:          02:01:40       You could have got, you could have got missed by a gust of wind and [inaudible]. Literally you could have, you could have been missed by the wind picking up.

Speaker 4:          02:01:55       So while all that's going on.

Speaker 5:          02:01:58       Okay,

Speaker 4:          02:01:59       back to the book. Highlander was the radio call sign for Captain Swenson. He was trying to gather reinforcements. He pulled aside the lieutenant in charge of the Quick Reaction Platoon, mount up Swenson's and told him, you're no help back here. We need your fire power. I can't. Lieutenant said the tox says we're to cover the vehicles. Swenson grabbed the lieutenant's 50 watt radio and called the Joyce. The talk told the platoon to move into the valley, Swenson, Fabio, rod and how Fez then hopped into an undamaged Tom the to drive back in, but the platoon did not follow. Instead, the platoon leader again called back to Joyce and somehow received permission to remain in the rear. Out of the fight.

Speaker 6:          02:02:45       Yeah. It was frustrating. It was frustrating. It was frustrating that, you know, and I, I, I met that guy a few years ago. We ran into, we were in the same meeting.

Speaker 5:          02:03:01       MMM.

Speaker 6:          02:03:03       It was frustrating. Every bit of it was frustrating. It was so, I mean, every single bit of it was unnecessary, unnecessary and frustrating.

Speaker 4:          02:03:21       Back to the book, I started the day with 14 or 16 tourniquets. I use them all. I put four on one guy who'd lost his left arm and his left leg below the knee. He survived. One ask are shot in the neck. Sounded like he was slurping through a straw. There was nothing I could do except listen to him. Strangled to death. Yeah. At 1.2 FTE f fifteens roared low through the valley, opening their afterburners to create a hell of a lion's roar. The pilot's wouldn't drop any bombs.

Speaker 6:          02:03:59       Yeah. I mean, and you know, usually, but at this point, you know, the only show of force ever works is, is, I mean, they had so much momentum at this time. I mean, it was like momentum. Right. So it started out as fighters, like his fighters that came across the border. And then what it turned into was when they seen that we weren't getting the support and when they seen that we weren't getting control of the situation and fires weren't coming, they escalated and they gained momentum. What everybody else joined in, you take the, so you had the guys that showed up to fight and then you have the opportunist of the villagers that turn into fighters instantly because they have the upper hand and so they start gaining momentum of more people fighting you every minute. Cause I was,

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       I got to do is pick up the gun off the dead person. You know what I mean? Literally. I mean there were literally women run in through uh, the village with the like these bowls and you know, you look at them, you know, well, you know, she's just a woman with a ball running rocket comes in, she drops the ball and it's full of grenades and ammunition. The women were running up and re re supplying all of these guys.

Speaker 4:          02:05:09       The Kai is Kai was, we're still supporting you back to the book. Inside the villages, the army pilots ran astonishing risks to find my team or co a Kiowa would swooped down toward the compound flare back at rooftop level and potter down the alleyways at 20 miles an hour, allowing the pilots to peer into every backyard in, into every window.

Speaker 5:          02:05:32       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:05:32       As the day grew hotter, we gradually cleared the valley of casualties. Over 30 wounded or dead were evacuated. We watched a Salono. The lead pilot brought us Chi went down to a few feet above a trench and Hubbard there. Highlander. We spotted five bodies. I'd heard all I needed. I jumped out the door and sprinting across the field to the right, opening some distance before Swenson yelled at me. I ignored him knowing he'd be right behind me. A PKM shifted me, shifted to me when I was halfway across the terrorist. I hopped over a terrace wall and fell into a deep well constructed trench. I landed next to Dani Johnson and my heart stopped. He was lying on his back with his arms out, spread his eyes open.

Speaker 5:          02:06:30       Okay,

Speaker 4:          02:06:30       but never to see anything again on this earth. A few feet further on, I came across the body of an Afghan interpreter who had traveled with our team. I felt sick to my stomach. I knew what I would see next. Lieutenant Johnson lay on his back with his eyes closed.

Speaker 5:          02:06:53       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:06:54       He looked peaceful despite the entry wounds in his right shoulder. Doc Layton and lay on top of him with medical supplies scattered around. I rolled him over. Doc had taken a three round burst in the right cheek off to the right staff sergeant can AFIC was lying face down. His gps with a busted screen clenched in his left hand. His mouth was open and full of dirt.

Speaker 5:          02:07:26       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:07:27       I think he was yelling out his grid location. The numbers I heard over the radio four hours earlier when he was shot in the back of his head, the team was wiped out. Their bodies were stiff and cold. Most of their gear was gone. Weapons, helmets, radios. The two 40 machine gun was missing, but Lieutenant Johnson's pack was filled with link Ammo. No one had fired the gun. I was supposed to be caring. I had never believed it would end like this. My mind refuse to accept what I was seeing. Hour after hour, I'd imagined them holed up inside a stone house, shielded from RPG blast, exchanging gunfire with the Douche men who were, who knew better than to rush them. Swenson was standing above the trench. We were taking random incoming and he was watching for movement among the houses. He talked into his radio for a few seconds and bent down and picked up some of the teams. Gear. He didn't say a word. He left me alone with them,

Speaker 2:          02:08:41       okay?

Speaker 4:          02:08:41       I always did the staff sergeant over my roles, right shoulder. He was heavy and I fell. Once he landed on top of me, I got up and carried him to an Afghan truck, carefully talking him into the open bed.

Speaker 2:          02:08:55       Okay?

Speaker 4:          02:08:56       I stood there for a minute, suddenly beat as I turned away from the truck, half has put his hand on my shoulder. The Asghar say, you carried out, they're dead. Now they want to help you. Five or six of us returned to the trench while the damn PKM kept shooting at us. I carried Dani Johnson back the ass cars, took Lieutenant Johnson and Doc Leighton Swenson loved back the rest of the equipment.

Speaker 2:          02:09:25       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:09:26       After six hours it was over and I felt empty as a balloon without air. Hafez took me aside. They've gone to a better place. He said, don't cry the ass cars. We'll take it as weakness.

Speaker 4:          02:09:45       No Way. I was going to cry, but at that moment I didn't feel like killing new anyone either. I wasn't angry or bitter, just deflated and exhausted as the wide run a marathon and couldn't remember why I wanted to do it. I was too damn tired to stand still taking fire. We left the valley in a convoy of about four trucks. Rod stopped near the casualty collection point where we talked with Captain Kaplan and Captain Ed, Corporal Norman, who had walked down from their observation posts, Staff Sergeant Valdez and Miller radio that they were coming down from their perch to everyone was accounted for. We had shuttled in and out of the valley five, six or seven times that morning, depending on which one of us you asked. It was all a fog. No senior American or pursuit force had come forward from camp. Joyce. Captain Swenson said he would try to wrap things up half as an I climbed into the back of an Afghan truck carrying my dead brother's I held staff sergeant can affect with my left hand and Lieutenant Johnson rested on my right arm. As we bounced down the track, we passed. Villagers returning to God your golf.

Speaker 4:          02:11:01       Some started to laugh, pointing out my dead friends. I reached for my rifle. Don't half ass said holding my arm, not worth it. When we arrived back at Camp Joyce, I walked into the battalion aid station to get bodybags. Major Williams rushed up and clutched it. My body armor tell me they're not all dead. Not all of them.

Speaker 2:          02:11:30       Okay,

Speaker 4:          02:11:30       they're all dead. I said removing his hand. I walked outside where my friend Sergeant Charles Bogus was waiting. Boca said, I'll give you a hand. We walked back to the bodies.

Speaker 2:          02:11:49       Okay,

Speaker 4:          02:11:50       sergeant major Jimmy Carr. Bellow the top enlisted men at Joyce hastened up and put his hands firmly on my shoulders trying to steer me away. You don't have to do this devil dog. My guys will make sure it's done right. That wasn't how to end it. If I had died, I'd want Lieutenant Johnson and staff sergeant can affect to put me in the bag. I'll finish it. I said bogus and I carried the bodies back next to the freezers. Take off their battle gear and dig through their pockets marking items for shipment to their families. I take a Chevron from Staff Sergeant Kenefick and attach it to my dog tags.

Speaker 2:          02:12:35       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:12:35       40 we had started out not liking each other a thousand years ago. We cleaned them up as best we can, wiping the blood and dirt off their faces, taking off their field gear, straightening out their camouflage uniforms and placing each in a black body bag. We mark the name, got the head draping American flag over each bag, bow our heads in prayer and drive them out to the Hilo. Pat Gone to gall was one of the deadliest small arms battles. Nope. The Afghanistan

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       war.

Speaker 5:          02:13:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:13:34       We lost five advisors in addition to team Monte, army sergeant first class Westbrook, a died of his wounds. Eight ask. Ours were killed in 13. Seriously wounded by rifle machine gun and RPG fire.

Speaker 5:          02:13:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:13:51       The enemy losses to small arms. We're probably have a similar number. There were no ids, no bombs, and very few artillery shells. Bullets caused most of the casualties. Ganja gall was a mountain fight from an earlier century. And it's a fight from an earlier century.

Speaker 5:          02:14:28       But uh, yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:14:42       but some things don't change. That's a fact.

Speaker 7:          02:14:52       Yeah, it was a, Gosh, you know, I say it and I don't think people understand it, but do you know, I might not physically died that day, but I died right there next to him. I mean, you talk about, you know, I mean, it's one thing to lose one person, but everybody, I mean, it's uh, Eh, I mean, I mean that's the worst case scenario. You're living it. Do you know what I mean? You're literally, you don't even have anybody from your own team to put your dad on the bird. Do you know? And you know,

Speaker 1:          02:15:49       how old were you at this point? 2121 years old. 2121.

Speaker 7:          02:16:00       You know, and I, I don't know if it talks about it in the book, you know, after I did that with my teammates, I went straight from there and I went to um, so are the Afghan side and I did it with all their guys too. And usually what they do with their guys is they just call the families and they got so many days to come get him and I wasn't allowing that. I went back and I took body bags up there and we gave them the exact same respect that we gave my guys and we put them in the freezers until our families came and got him. And you know, I didn't go, I didn't go start worrying about my stuff until we had taken care of all the, all the guys, you know, and it's just, it was his long day. A long day.

Speaker 5:          02:16:54       Okay.

Speaker 7:          02:16:57       And I mean,

Speaker 1:          02:17:04       you do, you, you're just like, okay.

Speaker 5:          02:17:08       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:17:08       You still have a job to do. Yeah. So, I don't know if it talks about it in there, but that, you know, they tried to put me on the helicopter with him to go back to a bog room and then wanted me to fly home to do the ramp ceremonies and he wanted me to fly home with them

Speaker 5:          02:17:28       and

Speaker 7:          02:17:29       I actually put them on there and I told him I would be right back. And I knew those birds had to take AUC. Same words, the PJ's weren't going to sit on the flight line very long and I, I just made sure that I knew that they had took off before I got around anybody else because I mean, they were dead. I mean, I still had guys who still needed me and they didn't need me anymore. And so I, you know, you know, I knew my Afghan soldiers needed me. They needed to see that, that they weren't alone. They needed to see that, that we're in this together, you know? And that was what, that was what mattered to me. But what the guys, I still had left.

Speaker 1:          02:18:12       How did the Afghan, your Afghan soldiers respond to this whole situation? You know, sometimes in Iraq there'd be a mass casualty like this and we'd lose a whole, there was actually in Ramadi, we lost a whole battalion. They all, they all left. Yeah, they quit. Yeah. What were your guys did? How did it affect them?

Speaker 5:          02:18:35       Okay.

Speaker 7:          02:18:36       I mean, they stuck it out. You know, they stuck it out.

Speaker 5:          02:18:42       MMM.

Speaker 7:          02:18:44       They did. I mean, I'm telling you that your, they are some of the most incredible human beings I've ever seen. You know, we come in and deploy, we're there for a certain amount of time. They live at forever. And, uh, they responded. I mean, they, you know, they, they got their shit together. Um, and yeah, I mean, we were back in the fight three days later, you know, and they don't get, they don't get to risk, but they don't get the support we do. You know, they don't get, I mean, they don't get anything we get, you know what I mean? [inaudible] and it's just, you know, but we, but we stuck together, you know, they helped me, they helped me get through it. Um, and I hope I helped them, but I think the most incredible thing was it was that point that,

Speaker 6:          02:19:28       that they brought me into there. I was accepted as one of them. You were one of them. Yeah. And that was probably the most rewarding piece of it to me. You know, was it, I, I had finally proven myself to them that, that I was, one of them

Speaker 4:          02:19:48       in deployment wasn't over yet. And you know, there was more fighting to be done. Going back to the book army, an army convoy had been ambushed north of Monte, lieutenant colonel and Captain Brian, the company commander were on their way to assist. I look to colonel you who nodded in agreement minutes later. You Bakis Staff Sergeant Richards and some of the colonel's guys that came with him, uh, doesn't ask ours and I, we're headed out the gate. Or basically what you run into is there's a, uh, a huge kind of, what did somebody hit an IED? Is that what had happened?

Speaker 6:          02:20:31       It was all day ambush aside this and they, what they done, they blew the Jingo trucks up and block the road. So that, you know, they intertwine those Jingo trucks and between the u s convoy and it's so stupid. And so the jingle truck is blown up and it's blocking the road. So guess what happens? The rest of them, they're all sitting and you can't go around it because it's about a 250 foot drop off into the Kunar river on the side. So they're stuck on the side of this. And I've been listening to it on the radio for a long time and I knew they were going to get slaughtered. I knew that you weren't just going to sit there and they had buttoned up. So that's what you were talking about earlier. You buttoned up and you wait, well now they're going to maneuver on.

Speaker 6:          02:21:11       Yep. And that's what they were doing fire though. And that's what they were doing. So the guys in the Jingo trucks had jumped out. And, uh, I kept, I kept asking over the radio, you know, cause I could monitor and I kept asking over the right and I could see the smoke from where, how his head and I kept asking over the radio show is a clip platoon and I cat a combat logistics patrol. And I kept asking over the radio, how many rounds have you fired? Cause I was afraid they were gonna get low on Ammo. Zero. Damn.

Speaker 5:          02:21:39       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:21:39       So that's when you rolled out.

Speaker 5:          02:21:42       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:21:43       You get out there and this is three days after Ganja Gall Damn

Speaker 4:          02:21:49       pkms and a case we're hammering down on this mess with little return fire would be crazy to drive into that tangle of vehicles. Is it bogus or Bach is focus. Focus focus was on the mark 19 on our truck. He couldn't shoot because of the angles of fire. Richard stayed in the driver's seat wide. Vance on foot by bounds into the wreckage our ass cars. Ron Ran forward with us, but they're light [inaudible] sixteens didn't impress the Taliban machine gun crew. I was quickly pinned behind us. Disabled truck looking up. I could see the P cam was shooting from a thick stone house 200 meters up slope. I actually needed to have a targets. I excited to have his target so close. I fired about five shells from my grenade launcher before my common sense kicked in. What am I doing? I thought I'm out bad outmatched by a machine gun, but he, there's an army Humvee sitting next to me with no one in the 50 cal turret.

Speaker 4:          02:22:38       You run over there, man. You're 50 calla yelled at where logistics came. The muffled reply. We don't fight some supply guys can't wait to get into the action, but not this gang. I wasn't worried though. Wild Man Kerr would soon have air on station. Bodies were scattered all over the road. All civilians lying face down next to me alongside the army truck was a skinny teenager and a tee shirt bleeding from shrapnel in his chest and his left arm. He was a pathetic sight sprawled on his back and his filthy brown shorts, an orange tip needle protruding from above his heart and a plastic stopper shoved above his left nostril. He didn't weigh as much as I ate in a day. His hands and feet were uglier than the dirt from his efforts to crawl out of the line of fire. He wasn't old enough to grow a beard, but he had a full shock of black hair.

Speaker 4:          02:23:24       Not a bad looking kid. Once he was cleaned up at the aid station and had some ice cream, he'd be okay. I felt good. In fact, I was pumped. I had applied dozens of tourniquets, but this was the first time I had smelled death his out and that's cause you needled him down and I didn't cover that part yet. A sucking chest wound and you, you gave mud decompression. I had saved a human being, a poor, scrawny kid eking out a living by driving a banged up truck pass known ambush sites. What do you eve, what do eventually join the Taliban and betray and American convoy? I had no idea. Sure. Some of the villages at Gone Juggalo had been real pricks, but why should I hold it against this kid? I ran back down the road, hoisting up another wounded truck driver and carried him back. Then I stopped to check on the skinny kid. I wanted a pat him on the shoulder to make myself feel good for my supposedly wonderful deed. Only he was dead. He had bled to death from the wound to his left arm. The crew in the army truck had let him bleed out, not five feet away because he was an Afghan and they were afraid,

Speaker 5:          02:24:28       dammit.

Speaker 4:          02:24:31       The Afghan drivers were all huddled together in a ditch by the river. The ambush had been sprung about 90 minutes earlier by now. They had pissed themselves dry and had nowhere to go. I banged my rifle on. I'm being my rifle, but on an army truck yelling to the soldiers to open up at least give me some water for those poor bastards. I shouted. A sheep is medic, got out of the truck with several bottles of water and his med pack and ran over the ditch. I knelt there looking at the blood stage stains from the kid right beside the truck door. I banged on the steel door again. It opened a crack. Fuck you. I said to the captain inside as the traffic jam was sorted out, Cornell, you and I walked back to our home v the dead kid, kid lay on the hood and rather ride to base with a corpse

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       between us. We wedged the body in the trunk. Sometimes you laugh, sometimes you want to cry before dropping the shell down a mortar tube. The gunner levels the bubbles on his site. If he loses the bubbles than the tube is pointed at a crazy ankle after ganja juggle. I was losing the bubble.

Speaker 1:          02:25:51       So investigations take place. There's actually a, you know, accusations and excuses. And one of the terms that that wasn't there, that was it. There was, it was being said that there was four battle management. Yeah. And you're talking to a psychologist onsite at this time and you know, that's some of the support you were talking about that we might have an Afghan kid and the Afghan army might not have. And it was a feat. Was it a female captain, Katie cop and she was making some assessments? Yeah, back to the book. It's true. I didn't feel connected with others. The askers were smoking Hash jabbering on their cell phones and wandering around and flip flops. The American soldiers were playing video games, stuffing themselves at dinner, laughing too loudly at nothing. We weren't fighting a war. We were holding a few acres of dirt while the war swirled around outside our barbed wire.

Speaker 1:          02:26:45       There were Douche mean in every valley. Drink tea with the villagers. Pay $40 for a chicken. We were in Kumar to fight. Let's get it on. That was my attitude. The psychologist insisted that I go back to the states for treatment. No thanks. As a captain, she had the rank to make a recommendation stick, but she wanted my agreement. So she challenged me. We would play a game of ping pong. If I won, I could stay. I lost by one point. She was very good and she really was worried about me and cared about me. I knew that,

Speaker 2:          02:27:20       okay.

Speaker 1:          02:27:22       It was my time to go home ping pong game. Was she like a Legit Ping Pong player?

Speaker 7:          02:27:30       No, I thought I had her. You know, I was the only, uh, you know, it was either, you know, I, um, it was probably best I went home. Uh, I would say if it wasn't, if I didn't go home, I, I would've never came home. Um, you know, I was just getting wound tighter and tighter. I mean, I was, you couldn't tell me, you couldn't tell me. I was not, I wasn't, I wasn't command like you couldn't, you couldn't tell me what to do. You were out of control. I was, I was out of control. Yeah. Uh, I mean, you know, I wasn't doing anything, nothing, you know, a morally unethical, right. Like nothing. I was doing my job, but as far as like commanding

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       me, you couldn't, you, you were going to do what you were going to do. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I was, you know, I was at the point to where I had no, I had no, uh, I didn't trust my command. I didn't trust anybody. I didn't trust anybody who's gonna. I mean, it was, uh, I was the one, you know, not a one man. I was a three man operation. Right. I mean I was, but I was a one man. I was a one man wrecking crew. Right. Like I was, I mean I was going to do, you aren't going to tell me anything. I mean there was, it was, it was pretty bad. I mean, I was fighting and how, you know, the fist fighting.

Speaker 5:          02:28:56       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:28:57       Uh, you know, how much the last guy, how much longer was it that you actually lost the ping pong match and got sent home?

Speaker 3:          02:29:02       I lost it. Right. Um, a couple of days before thanksgiving. Okay. So it was like you were, you were there for another, what's Thanksgiving meal and, and, yes, and we fought her ass off the whole time. The whole time. It was, it was, we fought our asses off almost every single day and sometimes three and four times a day. Well, that momentum that you talked about in the valley, they built it. It keeps coming. Right. It keeps coming cause right after that they overrun Keating right after. I mean, it's all of that, all of it, you know, they just built so much momentum and they were hammering us. I mean hammering us every day and um,

Speaker 5:          02:29:43       you don't hate it was, it was pretty bad.

Speaker 4:          02:29:48       So you get sent home here. We go back to the book. When I got home in December, I felt like I landed on the moon.

Speaker 5:          02:29:54       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:29:55       Everyone around me was excited about football, Christmas and other normal things. I was looking at the clapboard houses and the cars thinking, man, that's so flimsy. They wouldn't give cover worth shit in a firefight. It was an exposed feeling and where where my machine guns, I found my old pistol and kept her around like a rabbit's foot, but I missed my two forties and my 50 cows something awful.

Speaker 4:          02:30:17       It seems weird, I'm sure. But I really just wasn't buying that. There wasn't some enemy about to come over the green hills and I felt so unprepared. I wouldn't be any good to protect anybody. I was soon sent off to Fort Thomas, Kentucky for Ptsd therapy. Maybe that would settle me down and let me get some sleep and stop feeling so depressed and angry at every little thing. Some guys really go nuts when they come back and I wasn't in danger of that, but I could feel the kind of crazy things that maybe got the better of them. You're over there long enough and under such constant battle stress that it resets all your settings the way, way into the red and they're very hard to set back. The main thing knowing was that I didn't get my friends out as I had promised. I had spent a good part of my 21 years being pretty critical of other people who failed at their responsibilities and now it was all coming back on me and a dump truck.

Speaker 4:          02:31:31       Everyday. The psychologist urged us to step back and identify why we were experiencing negative emotions. In other words, take a minute to really be conscious of the emotion instead of just letting it seep in. Don't let your mind stay in neutral. Watch your thoughts and by the way, I'm hitting this stuff pretty hard because a lot of people that listen to this podcast, yeah are, are, are thinking these things right here. I think that's an important part. Don't let your mind stay in neutral. Watch your thoughts. Refusing to get out of bed or go to work or smile at others are all decisions. Find the reasons, those decisions and turn negative feelings into positive actions. It's not enough to identify why you're feeling bad. It's about having the character to do something positive, to take up that space. Don't wallow in your misery, which is just selfish, childish shelf absorption. It was all good stuff. All I ever need is a good operating manual through you're getting some good instructions.

Speaker 6:          02:32:28       Yeah. Not with, you know, I can't say that the end of the PTSD center helped me, but what it did is it educated me, it educated me on why I was feeling the way I was and what it was, and then therefore that helped me deal with it. Right. Um, it Kinda like, you know, uh, you know, you, you, you know, Kinda like how you know your diet that works for you. Hmm. You know, like you can look in the mirror, are you, how you feel after you eat it. Right? Yeah. It's kind of the same thing. Like it educate you on why your body's doing this or why you're having this reaction, you know, and, and that it's normal and it's just, you know, and this is why it's doing it and this is how you help counter it. Right. And that was kind of, that was kind of what it did for me. It didn't, I don't think it really, it didn't, it didn't fix anything. It just educated me on what the problem was. So you could start to identify the problem. Yes. So I could identify the problem, I could identify why I was feeling this way, and then, you know, I could make decisions based of, of how I

Speaker 4:          02:33:31       was that when you look at the root of that problem, yeah. What was it that feeling of like, hey, the, the promise that you made was, I'll get you guys out.

Speaker 6:          02:33:38       No, I mean, no, I mean the facts of the facts are like, here, here's, I get so frustrated with people who want to, like, I'm, I'm a factual guy. Like, you know what I mean? I, I'm, everything to me is black and white and, and I'm, I'm in fact base. Like I, I went in that day to go get my teammates out. I failed, I failed. There's no, you can't jump around it. You can't, you can't ignore the facts of what happened. I failed. I failed miserably. And so, you know, you, if you tell you, if I tell myself I didn't fell, I lie, I'm lying to myself. So

Speaker 7:          02:34:18       for me, you know, um, I failed, I was tested and I failed

Speaker 4:          02:34:25       and

Speaker 7:          02:34:27       now I have to figure out what to do with that. And that's part of it,

Speaker 7:          02:34:33       you know, and, and that, and that's where I get so upset about like, you know, the counselors or whatever. Right. It's not, well you didn't fail. No, no, no. Like as soon as they say that to me, hi, Yay, I'm done. I'm done. Cause no, that's, I'm not going to lie to myself. I failed and now I need to deal with it. I need to deal with it. You know, I can't lie. And, and that's, and I mean look, I mean it's, I always say the equivalent to try to make people understand like how to, how I feel about it in this situation is it would be like you inside of a house and your family's there and the house catches on fire and you end up getting out thinking that maybe they're all out and you can't get back in there and they all burned to death.

Speaker 5:          02:35:27       Okay.

Speaker 7:          02:35:28       That's kind of the equivalent of it. And you know, so I just have to deal with it and, and you know, I deal with it the best I can every day. I learned from it. I try to turn it into something good, but at the end of the day I still failed.

Speaker 4:          02:35:44       And

Speaker 7:          02:35:47       you know, that's, that's the way it goes.

Speaker 4:          02:36:01       Going back to the book, ma'am, after my two months at the clinic, Mike, my enlistment term was in fact coming to an end. It didn't take a genius to see it. I'd be be, and I'd end up behind a desk. So I chose not to reenlist. I love the core. So it hurt. Before joining the corps, I had three concussions, mononucleosis, and an operation on my right knee. When I mustered out four years later, I'd added two operations on my right hand or right road or rotator cuff operation, a fourth concussion from an RPG, a dislocated shoulder, and two herniated discs from clumsily lifting the dead and wounded one vertebrae. Given Wayne Ganja gold. When I picked up an ask aren't slipped in the bloody mud under him. I have no idea when the second vertebrae went out during the battle, I had that nick and my arm from a bullet or shrapnel, but that hadn't been anything. I was in deep in decent shape for construction work. I figured.

Speaker 5:          02:37:03       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:37:05       After the Ptsd Clinic, I returned to Kentucky. It was the winter of 2010 and they warm myself up by slipping back into hard drinking each night. I hadn't seen an active duty grunt months. Fabio and Rodriguez Chavez were due to receive the Navy Navy crosses at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, but I couldn't get enough time off to fly back east where you work in construction at this point? Yeah. And your boys are getting Navy crosses. You can't get time off from work. Swanson and I had been recommended for the medal of honor. We knew that. No, we knew though that the award was usually downgraded. Upon review. When I drank, which was too much, I'd laugh at the insert absurdity. I had screwed up big time. My achievement was losing my brothers. The Marine Corps would come to its senses and I'd never hear another word from another devil dog. I had no idea what was in front of me and I didn't care.

Speaker 4:          02:38:13       I couldn't take a walk, turn on the TV or read a book to distract my mind. The emptiness of my life was the dark all around me with nothing to see you in any direction. Four years ago, I'd left the form for an adventure and a new beginning. The chord shape meaning and I had arrived in Afghanistan. Confident. I do well in combat. Sure enough, up at Monte I had emerged as the young gun every day, brought fun danger against the backdrop of spectacular mountains. It was fun stuff. Shooting thousands of rounds, not losing many people and seeing the damage. You inflict it. There was no weapon I couldn't handle and my team trusted me to get them out of any hotspot my cockiness put us in, but when it counted most, I wasn't with them. They weren't trained to do my job. Gunny Johnson didn't spend every day behind a to 40

Speaker 5:          02:39:09       yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:39:09       Staff, staff. Sergeant Kenefick wasn't comfortable with weapons or ankles. A fire doc late and wasn't a fighter and Lieutenant Johnson didn't adjust fire missions. We aren't worried. We know you'll get us out if anything goes bad. Meyer, well, I didn't lieutenant. That was a load of worthless shit. Not there when you needed me.

Speaker 5:          02:39:33       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:39:34       Around three in the morning, I pulled my truck into the driveway of a shop owned by my high school friend Derek Yates had cut the engine. I turned on the cab light and fished out by cell phone. It wasn't right to burn my dad, but I wanted to connect one last time with someone.

Speaker 5:          02:39:55       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:39:55       I picked out a text message to my friends and then Toby, they had known me since I was a toddler, but they didn't know me that well. Did they?

Speaker 5:          02:40:06       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:40:06       Here I was back where I had started with an aluminum bracelet.

Speaker 5:          02:40:11       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:40:12       With two names on each

Speaker 5:          02:40:14       arrest.

Speaker 4:          02:40:16       That's what I had done with my life. Lost Four brothers.

Speaker 5:          02:40:22       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:40:23       I can't do it any more.

Speaker 5:          02:40:32       I typed,

Speaker 4:          02:40:36       I reached into the glove compartment where I kept my glock. I always kept a full magazine with a round chambered in the pistol. A Glock doesn't have a safety. You pulled the trigger and the weapon fires. I stuck the gun to my head and squeeze the trigger.

Speaker 5:          02:41:07       Click nothing. Nada.

Speaker 4:          02:41:17       No round in the chamber. As you can imagine. I sat there quite sobered up and didn't double shock suicide is terminal self revulsion. I was mixed up but I knew my team would be disappointed in me.

Speaker 5:          02:41:40       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:41:40       Staff Sergeant can effect would give me hell, which is where I would be bad ending. That was not going to happen.

Speaker 5:          02:41:53       Okay,

Speaker 4:          02:41:54       but who downloaded my pistol right on the spot? I knew who had done it. Have I ever talked to that person about it? No. I put away the pistol and drove home

Speaker 5:          02:42:12       that night.

Speaker 4:          02:42:14       I experienced no sudden change of direction in my life. I didn't know where I was headed in the future, but I knew, I knew quitting wasn't right.

Speaker 5:          02:42:26       Not that night. Not ever.

Speaker 4:          02:42:40       I had never told.

Speaker 5:          02:42:42       MMM.

Speaker 7:          02:42:44       I never told anybody about that night until it was published in the book.

Speaker 5:          02:42:50       And, uh,

Speaker 7:          02:42:53       I just, you know, I just felt like it was important to the story because I didn't want people to read the story and then just think that it was all okay when I came home. I didn't want to give them that perspective. And there are so many guys out there that write these books of the crazy shit that they do, but they never talk about what,

Speaker 1:          02:43:16       what that crazy shit does to them.

Speaker 7:          02:43:18       Yeah. They never talk about that. And so what happens is, is people read that and they're like, Holy Shit, that's, that's crazy. I could never do that because I deal with problems. And it's like, yeah, we all do. And you know, I had to put it into, I wanted people to know that I'm just a human. I'm no different now. And I, I felt like that I couldn't put in the, the, if you want to call it good stuff and not put in the bad stuff,

Speaker 1:          02:43:53       it's, I'm sure there's some psychologists that could figure something out about this. But you got to the point, right, and you made the decision clearly. Yeah. And you came out the other side by the grace of God and whoever knew you well enough to, to figure out that they needed to make sure you didn't have a loaded gun. But that's a message for anybody that feels like they're in the same situation that you felt like you were in, which is that there's not going to get any better is like, okay, come out the other side, man, come out the other side. And it was like, I mean, like you said, it's not a sudden change in direction, but you, but you knew

Speaker 7:          02:44:42       hi. Uh, you couldn't quit. I always like to say that, you know, sometimes you find yourself in the middle of nowhere and sometimes in the middle of nowhere you find yourself. And, uh, you know, I, uh, I mean I had no idea what my life was going. I made a deal with myself. You know, I had sat there and, uh, I had said, if I'm going to keep living this life, this way, the rack, rack it back and get it over with, but I said, if I ever put the car in drive, I'll never look back. And I sit there, I'm not going to lie to you. I probably sit there for five, 10 minutes. And I had done it at, at my buddy shot because I knew he'd be there eight o'clock in the morning and he could just find me. And, uh, I put it in drive and I just, I never looked back. You know, I, you know, and it's, I'm lucky. I'm fortunate. Did the gun didn't go off right. Um, but, um, you know, I think that, you know, you always got to hit that rock bottom, you know, I think that in that was for me, that was it. That was the rock bottom. And you know, it changed it.

Speaker 1:          02:46:03       I mean, again, I just want to stress this as much as I can because I believe me, I hear from people, especially from veterans that are, that are walking this line, man, they're walking this line. And if you're walking that line, hold it. Yeah. Listen, it's not worth it. I mean, it's,

Speaker 7:          02:46:23       it's not like, you know, I had to change, honestly, I had to change the way that I looked at life. The only problem there was was me, you know, instead of just facing it and saying, Hey, look, I want to fix this problem. I was blaming everybody else for my problems. And what I had to do was I had to say, you know, okay, if you know, if the things that I seen were so bad, I've seen what freedom cost firsthand. That's what's got me there. So if anything, I have more reason than anybody else in the face of this planet to go out and make the most of my life because I've seen it firsthand of what it costs. So instead of walking around and Phyllis, I, you know, I'm not feeling sorry for my teammates because they're in a better place, they don't feel anymore.

Speaker 7:          02:47:16       I'm really just feeling sorry for myself. And then by doing that, I'm sick. I'm wasting the sacrifices that they made on my behalf and I had to change the way I looked at it. Instead of using it as my excuse, I had to use it as my fuel. And that's a choice. That is a conscious choice. You wake up every day and you decide how you look at the situation. You decide what you do with the, you decide whether you use it as your excuse to hold you back or you use it as your easy a, you know, valve of hiding who you are or you use it as your fuel to go out and be the best that you can be. You decide that nobody does. Nobody else does. You do every day and it is a conscious choice. I mean, I still deal with it, but I still make the choice.

Speaker 1:          02:48:07       That's awesome. That's awesome. And anybody that's listening, like I said, anybody that's listening and that's, that's walking that line. Yeah. There you go. Make the right choice. Make the right choice, make the choice, make the right choice. And you know what the right choices. Yeah. And I mean you're talking about how much and, and I feel this too, like every day, how much am I letting down my friends that didn't come home if I'm not doing everything I can to take advantage of the gift they gave me, if to be sitting here right now. Right.

Speaker 7:          02:48:42       I mean, I mean any day that I don't want to go on and push on for myself, I can look down and I bet you anything, I got four reasons right here. They would switch me one day. They would switch me my worst day to have one more day.

Speaker 2:          02:49:00       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:49:00       Do you know? And, and, and I just,

Speaker 2:          02:49:04       yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:49:05       You know, I'm not okay with letting their sacrifice. It'd be wasted. I'm not okay with watching anybody else waste them. So why would I be okay with letting myself waste them?

Speaker 5:          02:49:22       Well,

Speaker 7:          02:49:28       and other thing I want to say, he is like walking that line. I want to say this and get it out there. It's normal. It's normal. It doesn't mean you're weak. It doesn't. I want to get that, that stigma out there. Uh, you know, I want to get that off the books is, it's, it is a normal, like I don't understand why, why it's okay in our society or in the military. A guy breaks his leg. Okay, do you go make him Ryan Tomorrow? Yeah. He puts a cast on it. He, he, he rehabs it. It's the same thing with the mind. It's the same thing. It's the same thing. You go in and you watch it. The people you have to worry about are the ones that go watch their close friends and they watch human beings and they watch this evil and people die and suffer and don't have a reaction. Those are the ones you have to worry about. It is a normal reaction to a not normal situation. And it's okay. It's okay. It is 110%. Okay.

Speaker 5:          02:50:39       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:50:40       Absolutely man. Absolutely.

Speaker 7:          02:50:46       As you, we mentioned quickly, you know, there was some buzz possibly about, about you getting a medal of honor. Yeah. And, but you know how it goes. Like it was all, I didn't believe it. I never, I never had any idea. Uh, you know, you hear talk about it at Silver Star, medal of honor, navy, cross, whatever. Right. I didn't care. I didn't, I, I promised the last thing that I ever thought about. What's an award? An award. That's the last thing.

Speaker 5:          02:51:24       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:51:25       Well, it gets approved.

Speaker 4:          02:51:29       And going back to the book, when the president hung that medal around my neck, I felt glum. I couldn't smile and I said nothing. I gave no remarks and avoided the press. As a marine, you either bring your team home alive or you die. Trying, my country was recognizing me for being a failure and for the worst day of my life, the marine commandant, General Jim Amos at General Joe Joseph attended the ceremony. Throughout the years after gone to golf, the Marine Corps leadership has provided con consistent support, not just to me, but to all who fought there. The top enlisted man in the Marine Corps, Sergeant Major Mike Barrett twice came to our farm to meet my dad and Granddad and to encourage me. There is no such thing as a former marine.

Speaker 2:          02:52:30       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:52:30       50 years after they have left active duty. Marines still sign emails to each other with SF, semper Fidelis, always faithful. Of course we have among us those who failed themselves, their family and society. The fact remains though that the core expects every marine to live by a set of core values. In turn, the core keeps its side of the bargain.

Speaker 2:          02:52:53       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:52:53       You can not ask anything more of an organization than that. The metal of honor given in the name of the Congress of the United States of America, symbolizes the courage and determination of our entire country

Speaker 2:          02:53:10       and

Speaker 4:          02:53:11       speaking of the country you were in New York? I was in New York City.

Speaker 2:          02:53:21       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:53:22       at the twin tower site. Ground Zero with gunny Joshua Peterson. Someone I knew from my first days in the core, we were greeted by hundreds of police, firemen, construction workers, Wall Street guys and suits, city officials, and the families of the fallen Meyer. I can't believe this scene, gunny. Peterson said, make sure your ribbons are squared away. We stood side by side.

Speaker 2:          02:53:52       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:53:52       two grants and sharply iron Khakis waving like we had won an election. I thought of my sad fumbling meetings with the family of team Monte, the families of team Monte when I couldn't think of much to say. I was alive and their loved ones were not.

Speaker 2:          02:54:13       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:54:13       Now here I was standing before a monument for 3000 dead.

Speaker 2:          02:54:19       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:54:20       I saw some big iron workers in hardhats standing off to one side. When the ceremony ended, they sneaked me in onto a work elevator up. We went to the top of the ride where we then climbed wooden ladders until we couldn't go any further.

Speaker 2:          02:54:38       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:54:39       Then the [inaudible] guard rails. I stood there looking out at the most beautiful country in the world, trying to make sense of my feelings. This was where it all started. So many good people lost the people who had been working here and the people I had known who had not gone blindly into uniform, they had reasoned why Americans do that.

Speaker 2:          02:55:05       But they had gone ahead to do and to die.

Speaker 4:          02:55:13       An iron worker handed me a silver marker. Then I wrote on a girder.

Speaker 2:          02:55:23       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:55:24       For those who gave

Speaker 2:          02:55:29       all

Speaker 4:          02:55:44       for those who gave all, and that wraps up the book, Em, you know, you're talking about the awards and what you hear and what happens and all that. And I wanted to say this as well, on the battlefield, on that battlefield, and on every battle, there are acts of extreme valor that no one will ever know about. I'm talking about an infinite number,

Speaker 2:          02:56:26       okay.

Speaker 4:          02:56:27       No one's ever going to know about them. And it's important to know this, that our military men and women don't do what they do for metals or ribbons. They do what they do because they love freedom because they love America because they loved their comrades in arms, and that right there is why our country thrives in battle, not because of technological advances, not because of superior weapon tree, not even the size of our military. It's because of the bond that is shared between warriors that is our real strength and Dakota, that something that you represent in space. They don't. I want to thank you for coming on the podcast and sharing this incredible story and an, I know it's not only a story of you, but it's a story of all the men, American and Afghan as well, that rode into battle with you that day and showed a once again what it is that makes America a place of, of hope and a freedom. It's because of, it's because of man. It's because of individual men that in their heart and even in the face of death, actually live actually live the ideals of this great nation.

Speaker 4:          02:58:12       Not only in their words, but in their actions, in the way that they live and in the way

Speaker 5:          02:58:21       that they died.

Speaker 4:          02:58:26       God bless. All right.

Speaker 5:          02:58:31       They're incredible.

Speaker 7:          02:58:34       You know, I, I mean, you're exactly right. Like, I mean, there's so many stories that are, I mean, people have done so many stories of people doing such incredible stuff and you know, it's, it's, it's literally out of the love of another human being. It's literally, I the love of making the world a better place. That's really, that's really all we do. It's all we do. I mean, we join, nobody joins it. Okay. To go with just shoot people or fight. They literally joined to, to try to make the world around them a better place. Whether it's passing out a, whether it's rendering aid to a civilian or to, uh, uh, you know, I, fellow American or whether it's taken out the bully that's inflicting fear in that place. Every thing that we do is to try to make the world just a little bit better.

Speaker 5:          02:59:45       That's it.

Speaker 4:          02:59:47       Yeah. As I was reading about when, when you got back to your team, you could see, I mean just from the way the guys were laid out, you know, staff sergeant was trying to get comms and trying to pass grids and doc was working on the boss. I mean everyone was trying to make things happen and who knows what those moments were like, you know, but there's moments of there's, there's heroism there that we're never going to know about.

Speaker 7:          03:00:14       No, I mean, I mean 100%. I mean doc late and was rendering aid, you know what stopped him was cause pause l was with them. What stopped him of getting to the road was Lieutenant Johnson got hit and a gunny Kenefick in gunny Johnson were on either side, provide security while doc late and worked on him. And that was the med evac we heard called in from gunny. Kenefick was trying to call that medivac in for Lieutenant Johnson right here. And um,

Speaker 5:          03:00:48       you know,

Speaker 7:          03:00:50       but they weren't going to, they weren't going to leave him behind even more, even more of not leaving them behind. They weren't going to just throw him over his

Speaker 1:          03:01:00       shoulder and get him out. They were going to try to fix him.

Speaker 7:          03:01:07       I mean, what'd he say? What'd he say? I mean, you know that right there. I mean that right there is everything. I mean, you take that, you take, I mean, there's so many actions. I mean, I've watched people do such incredible things, such incredible things that just make what I do. I mean, Nah, you know, Nah, makes me look like a, you know, I've done nothing. I've, I've seen it, you know, people are incredible.

Speaker 1:          03:01:38       Well, I'm again, man. I can't thank you enough for coming on. No thank you on the podcast and hanging out and being out there and kicking ass and talking smack to people. I like that too. Uh, did I miss anything? Anything else? No. Thank you. Thank you. Covered it all. I uh, I think you covered it, you know, Echo, you got any questions for the man over there? Nah, usually I come up with some lighthearted question, but man, I'm out of words, to be honest with you. We took that little, a break. An Echo was like, man, he's that guy. Just keep the SEC. I, I, I'm sitting there thinking to myself, this really happened man. And I'm like, yeah, I told, I gave, I gave echo heads up sometimes, you know, I say, hey man, it's going to be heavy one or whatever. And I was like, told him this afternoon, I'm like, Amen.

Speaker 1:          03:02:43       It's going to be heavy one, you know, stand by. And you know, we're downstairs when we were taking that break and he's like, man, all this really happened. I said, yeah, and you know who it happened to? The guy we're sitting in a room with when his friends, like that's what happened. So, uh, no, I it, early on when I started this podcast, I'd be reading a book from Knight, from World War One. Yeah. Or I'd be reading the book from World War II or Vietnam or whatever, and I'd, I'd like after bite, I don't know how many podcasts, but like seven or eight podcasts, I was like, Hey, I just want to stop for a second and remind everybody that the characters that I'm talking about in these books, these characters, they're not characters in a movie. They're, they're people, they're humans. And this stuff that we're talking about really happened to these people. So again, it's obviously avenue sitting here. And I was talking to you about when, when Colonel William Reader was in here and you know, you're like, you're reading stuff that happened to him. He was tortured, he was mock executions. He had, he had, he was locked in a Bam, a two foot tall bamboo cage in the jungles and Vietnam and got his legs

Speaker 4:          03:03:58       in shackles and the, he's trying to sleep and he's getting woken up by the rats that are eating the wounds in his leg.

Speaker 7:          03:04:06       And it's like, that's just inconceivable. Yeah. I mean, edit happened. Yeah. I mean that's, you know, I hear stories like that and just, you know, that's real people. Yeah. These are real people dislike us.

Speaker 4:          03:04:27       Yeah. In, in, in, in honestly, man. I mean, I'm sure you saw me like sometimes, you know, um, yeah, I'm getting, I get emotional when I read your story, but why do I get raw emotional when I read your stories? Cause I'm thinking of everything I've been through. I'm thinking of my, my friends and I'm just like, it's

Speaker 7:          03:04:44       man, you know, it's a,

Speaker 5:          03:04:46       okay,

Speaker 4:          03:04:48       it's real. And, and for those of you people that are listening to this, and I talked to, I dressed like the veterans out there

Speaker 7:          03:04:56       a bunch today. Um, but you know, to those of you that

Speaker 4:          03:05:02       didn't have the opportunity to serve for whatever reason, you know, if I could relate something to you, it's like, yeah, these, these people, these lieutenants, these sergeants, these staff sergeants,

Speaker 7:          03:05:15       man, there are people, man. There are people. Yeah. They're just, they're just people. They're just people. I mean, that's, they're just people. They're just,

Speaker 8:          03:05:29       uh, you know, and I think that that's kind of what makes it hard for society of,

Speaker 5:          03:05:33       yeah.

Speaker 8:          03:05:33       Is it, they see so many of these movies and they read these books and you know, they read it, but what they don't understand is that somebody lived it, you know? And I think that that's a perspective that you always have to remind yourself of is that yeah, you're reading it and, but somebody lived at,

Speaker 7:          03:05:56       do, you know? Yeah. Then you kind of see, you know,

Speaker 8:          03:06:04       on the news like, Oh yeah. Then the medal of honor ceremony and the pictures, you know, of you getting there and you know, you see the president putting it on and it's like, wow, that's so great. Or whatever in you, what you don't, what we don't see, you know, people who haven't served, oh, is like what really happened to talk to arrive at that one quote unquote glorious moment where you get the metal. Oh my gosh, thank you. Let's go party or so, I don't know. Something, you know, it's like, Dang, Bro did. Yeah. People think it's just so great, you know? And, uh,

Speaker 5:          03:06:40       okay.

Speaker 7:          03:06:41       I despise everything that metal stands for for me. You know, me, not anybody else, but I,

Speaker 8:          03:06:51       you know, when I put that medal around my neck,

Speaker 5:          03:06:55       okay.

Speaker 6:          03:06:55       To me, it's literally here's the stamp to show the world how bad I

Speaker 7:          03:07:00       failed. Here's the, you know, um, that's why I don't, I don't wear it. I don't, I don't wear it because, you know, it's the worst day of my life. And, uh,

Speaker 6:          03:07:17       I lost everything that day. I lost not just my team. I lost my career in the Marine Corps. I mean, everything that I wanted to be

Speaker 7:          03:07:27       was gone within one day and, you know, and then I get recognized for it, you know? So not only do you have to live with it, but now you have to live with it in the face as a nation. Well,

Speaker 4:          03:07:47       from that perspective, from, from my perspective, looking at that.

Speaker 5:          03:07:53       Okay.

Speaker 4:          03:07:54       For one thing, the metal,

Speaker 5:          03:07:57       okay.

Speaker 4:          03:07:58       Yeah. I mean it was put around your neck, but I believe that metal represents everyone that was with your team and you might have gotten the, the, the metal put around your neck, but it's, it represents that story's going to be told over and over again in your name. Might be at the top of the list, but every name is going to be on that list. Everyone's going to know, and I mean, obviously I can't imagine the burden that comes with that metal that you live with, but at the same time being able to have that you have your brothers remembered. I think that it makes it worthwhile

Speaker 6:          03:08:39       and, and you know, in that, and that's the piece of it. You're right. I mean, so on the selfish, you know, when I, what I just said was on the selfish side of it, right? That, that, that is for me, um, that that is the only reason I did it except a metal was because

Speaker 7:          03:08:54       I want my teammates to live on forever. I want people to know who they were because the day that I stopped speaking, their name is the day they truly die. And I have an obligation that as long as I can still breathe, that their names are still need to be told. And um, so that's what that metal allows me to do and it is our metal. I mean it's, it's for them. Um, but yeah, I mean, you know, you don't,

Speaker 6:          03:09:26       it's just, it goes against, you know, and I think the one thing you know, that is so hard for us to wrap around is how many times in your training did you, how many times did you say it? Like when you were training guys and this and that, how many times did you ever set them up for when they did everything that they could, they failed

Speaker 4:          03:09:50       eight to be honest with you, when I was running training I that all the time. Yeah. I'm not kidding. I mean you can talk to anybody that went through training. When I ran it. It was, it was just mayhem and it was, you were going to, you know, you are going to carry out bodies. You had 16 guys in the platoon, you are going to be carried six bodies out and you're going to be carrying him for four kilometers to a helicopter extract, which wasn't going to show up and you're going to have to go on another six. It W it was brutal and there was times, there was times where I'd kill every single, you know, training. I'd kill every single seal because they were not doing what they're supposed to do, where they were making mistakes or the leadership wasn't stepping up. I did that all the time.

Speaker 4:          03:10:28       I did it all the time. I mean, I can't, I came back from Ramadi were when my guys were in some really bad situations and I wanted everyone to be ready for that man. And like that was, it was, I mean, I was not, I mean I, I came back from Pullman and got put in charge of training. It was awesome. It was the best thing that I ever could have done for me. And, and I, I've thought it was the best thing I could do for my teammates was to be like, okay, we're going to make this training hard, really hard. And, and so probably not. You probably thought I was gonna say never book man when I was running training and then that's, that's awesome. And I had gotten, I mean, I had many guys that came back from Iraq and Afghanistan and, and would say like, yeah, Amen.

Speaker 1:          03:11:17       We got, we got hammered hard in this situation and we were ready. Nothing is bad as your situation, but yeah, but the mentality of it is, you know, there are some situations you're not going to win. There are some situations where you show up and you're not going to win. And that's against everything that we believe in. Everything that we're taught. You know what I mean? That, that if we do our job and we do it right and you still lose, it doesn't make sense. Well let's, that's something I've told many guises meant you, you can do everything right. You can make no mistakes, then you can still get killed. You could still lose. You can still thinks, you know, there's decisions that you make on the battlefield. You say if you say, okay, go left, you can go left and everyone can be great and it's the best decision ever.

Speaker 1:          03:12:12       And you could say go left and everyone could die and it's the worst decision ever. There's, there's things that you can control inside of combat. So you prepare and train as hard as you can and, and the other thing you do is you get the leadership in the situ, in a mentality that they're not going to put themselves. This is like if my guys planned something that was stupid, I let a Mexican, this is in training. They came up with a dumb plan. They were going to execute that plan. I wasn't going to stop them and they were going to get slaughtered. So they'd learned some lessons. But Oh, that's why that training is so important and it's important in everything now. A hundred percent a hundred percent I appreciate you having me on. Yeah, man. Thanks for coming brother. No, thanks so

Speaker 8:          03:12:51       much, man. It's awesome man. Yeah, right. I do not accept that from you. If you are the man. All right. Echo. Yes. Talk about something good. Sure. Chill cruise. Little bit. Good. What do you mean? Okay, so we'll shift gears. Kind of a rough transition. I'll let him know that we're like three hours plus right now so you can tell it quickly if you want. If I want, please see how they kind of recommend that. I feel like me and Dakota, we have some catching up to do. You guys have been talking so you know I might drag this out a little bit. No. Okay. So origin mean, this is where you get Jocko supplements. Krill oil joint warfare's for your joints. It's free joints. Yes. Important supplement. Yes. Important supplement. Yeah. Also he has one called disciplines, the cognitive and physical enhancement supplement. Preworkout pre mission. It's what it's called. It's a good one. Also at origin may its origin, main.com Maine.

Everything in orange is the,

Speaker 9:          03:14:09       we'll get you an origin Giesen and American. You got to represent some of them.

Speaker 8:          03:14:18       Yup. From threats from the cotton. By the way. We grow the cotton in America, not the guy. And they import the fabric and we assemble them in everything from seat. What is it? From seeds to seat from dirt to shirt. The shirt or tee shirt. The shirt. I'm pretty good, right? Yeah, it was good. I liked it. Oh they got some rash guards on their spats. Yeah. You know what spats are? No. Yeah, we didn't really either. We had to kind of, we had to research it arrived at spath. Here's the bottom line. They're spandex, their tights basically. Compression gear. Where do you train? Do you train a 10th planet?

Speaker 9:          03:14:55       Do you do to some you seen dudes down there was playing or was always talking about it in its 10th planet. It's all about them. Bats. They're all about the spouse was worried about, I was worried about using the word spats cause I didn't, I w it sounded like maybe it was some kind of like, let's just say sounded kind of girlish like some girl, like a girl would be like, oh I'm going to wear spanx. What are those? It sounds like spanx. I don't know what some girls wear. Rice banks are real tight. Like the, it's Kinda like, it's essentially compression. Compression. Like I would compress, compress, they should be illegal. I figured out somebody who should be illegal because it's like selling, oh it's false. I was on, we were on like some kind of live broadcasts and someone would, spats is comes from what soldiers? Cavalry soldiers in World War war, like leggings. And they were called spats and I was like, okay, it's cool. Well let's say it now. Yeah, they weren't really even leg you. They're just, it's like this lower, have that lower part that covers the boom

Speaker 8:          03:15:59       that was straight up. That is not spats. That's something else. What are those things called? Did you have to do honor guard? You had to wear those things? No, I think they were actually called leggings. Wait, the, so we're unclear. I know what spats are very unclear because in football you tape your shoe and your ankle, that spat. So it just, you know, I like it. It works. It does. Right. See those nonetheless, origin has some spats, some compression gear, rash guard, and so it just all made American good stuff. Or did you mean.com go on there, check out all their stuff. You'd be like something, get something. Also for the kettle bells that I have Trina on it planet. Yeah. On it. You know the kettlebells?

Speaker 8:          03:21:01       I kind of feel like when it came down to Jocko to name his own store and stuff, he was all cool. But when Amazon names their thing echo, it's like you know me a little bit. See she messed up. I was on your team. No, no. You kind of called me out. Remember at that moment nonetheless.

So boom, now we have this album with tracks, chocolate tracks telling you to get how to get past moments of weakness that may come up. Waking up early, skipping workouts, you know, diet stuff on it works pretty good. That's bad ass 10 for 10 results. You'll never skip a workout for me. So I made this echo is like ask me, ask me a question one time like why do you not stip it? How do you not skip workouts? And I was like, well I'll just mobile boom.

Speaker 8:          03:23:32       Yeah Tony, you don't feel like, and he's like, dude, I need to record that. And then he just asked me a bunch of random questions and then we made a new recording and we put it on iTunes for sale. It was the number one spoken word on iTunes for I think, I think until you're both 11 months finally got knocked out of number one spoken word by when I released this book, discipline equals freedom field manual on iTunes as a spoken word album. So I'm just saying it's like, so Randy effective. Yeah. And it's not him. So Rah Rah. Just talk like I'm not a killer. You don't seem like a young, you don't have to know. You don't have to tell the guys, Hey, I mean obviously you've got to yell on the battlefield and you gotta yell people like you so they can hear you. That's one thing. But yeah, I mean I was used to tell guys, if you have to yell at someone and you've really screwed something up as a leader, if I got to yell at you or if I got to be like, yeah. Nonetheless, it's a, yeah, very effect. Like if you, he'll be like, oh, there's this one called sugarcoated lies. Right. And it's about like, you know how like when you're at work, you were talking about the good

Speaker 1:          03:24:44       video. Yeah. Right. So this is the same thing, but it's like a track you can get, you can get, actually this is the discipline equals freedom field manual album has good on. There's a track just to track. Boom. There you go. So you can put it in your whatever you can say. So because I had people calling, you should make an alarm clock, you should make alarm clock. So when we did the album with tracks and when you could use that thing as an alarm clock. So when people ask me for a long talking, I'm like go get the albums. There's three albums now by the way. Three albums, psychological warfare and this one was in two different albums. You really only need the first album of discipline equals freedom field manual frivolously for the audio. Yeah, you can get, well there's, there's, well if you want the knowledge parts, that's the second video. The second, the second album, you didn't know I was over here. So this is where, this is where echo started. Hammer Hammer me because you know when they list you, they list like psychological warfare and then they have to list who made it and it was artist Jocko Willink. No, no, no, no. I'm not an artist. I just, well, I'm just speaking. I'm just saying it works. That's not art. No, it's heck no, no, no. You're an artist. You know, so he didn't know that man.

Speaker 1:          03:25:48       I never, I never looked at you and said, well, I don't come across with the artist, some artist, artsy guy. Nonetheless, very effective. Very effective. Good way to support too, by the way, also on Amazon through Alexa, if you want, you can order Jocko white tea, Amazon Afghan. And by the way, I don't know if I'll give you some Jocko white tea. And the reason I'll give it to you isn't, I don't care if you like to, you might not. You might hate tea. But what this t does is it is a guaranteed, it's guaranteed to give you an 8,000 pound dead lift. It's scientifically proven over and over again. Double Blind, double blind, placebo tested right there. Jocko white tea, 8,000 pound deadlifts. Um, yeah. So you got that also her books, the books. Um, yes. Get into the fire by Dakota Meyer and being west.

Speaker 1:          03:26:43       Get it through our website. It's, it's an awesome read matter. We, we, I covered less than 10% of the book today. You only understand 10% of what the whole situation was by listening to this podcast. Get the book to support the podcast at Support Dakota. Learn about what these brave Americans and Afghans went through way the warrior kid. There's a book I wrote for kids. Why? Because who's, what kind of kids? What kind of books were kids reading? I know, cause I've got four kids. My kids were reading books about lame people that were being encouraged to be weak. Yeah. Instead of like, Hey, you know what? It's okay to actually get after it and try and be smarter and try and be stronger. So if you want your kid to be smarter and stronger and eat healthier and work harder, if that's what you want, you'd get the kid where the warrior kid, if you want to make your child a week and on disciplined, that's cool.

Speaker 1:          03:27:44       You can buy any other book for a kid and that's what you get. And that book did good with people and I wrote another one. It's called way of the warrior kid too. It's called Mark's mission and it's got a whole new genre of issues that mark has to face with his uncle Jake. Uncle Jake comes to help out young mark. Would you call them more advanced issues? They are slightly more advanced. Let me tell you which one of them. One of the, one of the issues that young marks or marks in sixth grade now in book too, he loses his temper sometimes and he gets in trouble at school for Hawking a paper machine, Pumpkin at another kid's head and it deflects off his head, hits the teacher in the face. Oh man, he gets, he gets sent home from school last day of school. Anyways, he has to learn to control his temper just like all kids do.

Speaker 1:          03:28:34       And I know this cause I got kids and I know this cause I was a kid and you remember when you were a little kid and you lose your temper and your dumb stuff evil. And when I say little kid, I'm talking like 23 years old. I was like sure. I was like, yeah, I do. You know what I'm talking about? They were, I got to go get you a copy. Uh, his uncle and the book is, is a seal. It was a seal and he comes to stay with them for the summer and helps them squared away these little problems. Yeah. Yeah. So that's what that one's about. He also learns about working hard. He gets a job, starts a business. He's 11 years old, has his own business, mowing lawns and pulling weeds. That's way the warrior kid and where the warrior kid to Mark's mission.

Speaker 1:          03:29:19       Uh, you can also get, speaking of which warrior kids from Irish oaks ranch, there's a young warrior kid, 12 years old business owner. He makes soap from goat's milk right here in California on his farm. Yeah. That's cool. Wow. Yeah. Well, it seems like, well, how are you? How does you even, why are you talking about this? He got in touch with me and said, I want to make good soap doco soap, and I was like, well, who are you? He's like, I'm a 12 year old kid named Aiden. I live on a farm. I'm starting a business. I figure you might want it on the action Jocko. And I was like, hey dude, how man, let's do this. Maybe some soap. You might want it on the AG. I is. He offered me a piece of the action. I was like, Oh God, yes. Amen, man. Warrior kid getting after it. And so yeah, you can order that soap at Irish oaks ranch. He's dot com you know, no big deal. Soap Empire, right? What is like Johnson and Johnson probably started off making soap. Ivory soap. You think ivory soap doesn't have some good profitability. Only differences. This kid starting at 12 you're guaranteed Johnson. Johnson didn't start at 12 sorry, 12 get on there. You just order some of, he'll have kinks worked out before

Speaker 9:          03:30:40       he can even drive. Yeah. Yeah. He's all over it. I mean, I'm telling you, he's a manufacturing soap. You think about when you were, um, I mean, let's just, let's just get all of our own, our own, lose herself out on the table here. What were you doing when you were 12? Right. I was like smearing boogers on my sister's daughter. You know what I'm saying? We're just talking loser. I was eating dirt. I didn't know it so poor. I was still eating dirt.

Speaker 1:          03:31:11       Yeah. I, I made up the slogan to simple slogan, simple slogan. And it's, it's actually a great slogan. You know what it is? Jocko stope state clean.

Speaker 9:          03:31:25       You got it. You got to admit it. I gotta tell you a God who would have been as good, sloping the good stuff. Good stuff. I don't know. I don't know how you came up with that. I'm telling you, Jocko soap stay clean. Right? With Jocko store.

If you need to get on the path, stay on the path and be on the path, move further down the path. If you're having trouble getting after it in life, get the book discipline equals freedom field manual and then don't just get the book and read it. You have to actually do something that's in it, but it's pretty clear. It's a field manual. Echo claims to know all about field manuals and my favorite kind of manual you actually know about field manuals go into field manual that tells you how to get after it so you can do that. The audio version of that is not on audible. You can't find it there. Why? Because you couldn't cut it up into tracks, which is what you all asked for.

Speaker 1:          03:32:29       It is on Amazon music. Google play iTunes as an MP three. Also extreme ownership. The book that Leif Babin and I wrote, it's about combat leadership. Some of them actually, every topic that we talked about today when it came to leadership and organizational issues, it's all, it's all things that are inside extreme ownership. Get that. And it's not just about war, but it's about life. It's about business. And on top of that, we have a leadership and management consulting company. It's called echelon front. We solve problems through leadership. Every problem that any organization has can be solved through one thing and one thing only leadership. That's it. So if you've got problems, call us Ashkelon front me, Leif Babin, JP Denelle, Dave Burke, echelon front.com. Of course also we have the muster, it's a leadership gathering to leadership gathering, seminar, conference gathering. And that's what we do. We, we get together, we have all kinds of leaders come, we present, we talk about issues, we give pragmatic actual tactics and techniques on how to lead people.

Speaker 1:          03:33:51       If you want to like come to a conference and get all happy and clappy and make hugging promises to the guy that's sitting next to you, don't come to this conference. That's not what this conference is. We're not singing and dancing at all. No. We talk about, we talk about how to lead. That's what it is. So if you want to learn how to lead, come to the, to the monster. There's only two of them in 2018 only two of them. One of them, Washington DC, May 17th and 18th. One of them. San Francisco. October 17th 18th. That's it. We're not going to, what's the name of your hometown? Columbia. Kentucky. We're not going to Columbia, Kentucky for the monster. We couldn't find it. We couldn't, we couldn't, your barn wasn't big enough to hold it in. If we can we expand it? Yeah, I'll, I'll work on it for next year.

Speaker 1:          03:34:40       Work on it. Uh, we actually did one in Austin. If I'd known you at the time, you would have been there. Awesome. And let me know if you want to come to one of these. We're, but we're not doing it in Columbia, Kentucky. Uh, we're not doing it in, what's another random place? Oh, mile call I Hawaii. We're not doing it in Hawaii. If you want to come, you gotta come to one of those to register a, by the way, they've all sold out. We've done four of them. They've all sold out. This one's going to sell out to register extreme ownership.com and we, okay, we raised the prices once we hit a certain date. Why do we do that? Why do we raise the prices once we hit a certain date to make my money? No, I'm just kidding. No, we actually don't want people to do that because what were the would reason we do is we, we want to incentivize people to register early so that we can block enough room, order enough food plan, plan correctly, get the venue set up the right way.

Speaker 1:          03:35:36       So we were trying to make people come early. So we, it's actually a pen. We're penalizing you for being slow and prefer procrastinating. Yes. Procrastination. You're going to pay. That's right. Oh, it's a procrastination penalty. I like where you're coming from. If you wait, you pay, I'll take credit for that. We like people that get after. Don't put that as one a Jockos. Okay. You'll get credit or get credit. I think you get a percentage because you were running off my lead and I got a little cut. All right, so that is that. And until the roster, if you have questions or feedback for us. We are, we are ready to receive on the interwebs on Twitter, on Instagram and on Dash Facebook. He Blah, echo is an echo. Charles and I am at Jockowillink and Dakota is on the interwebs in a big way, in a big way on Twitter at Dakota underscore Meyer. That's how we linked

Speaker 6:          03:36:36       up by the way via Twitter. That is, that was like, I can't believe you responded to me. It's so cool. And I'm like I can't believe you said something to me. A couple of little kids on Instagram. Dakota Meyer. Oh three 17 sniper. No just o three 17 Dakota Meyer. That's, that's Instagram on Facebook. Sergeant Dakota Meyer. You can just look to go to Meyer and it pops right up cause you're kind of the man. You have a podcast, you have your own podcast. It's called owning it, owning it with Dakota Meyer. Now you kind of took that from my book. Extreme ownership, no big deal. I did take a little slice of that. That's cool. You Have Dakota meyer.com is another place. So, like I said, that's why I said you're all over the interwebs cause clearly you are all over the interwebs. You got a youtube channel.

Speaker 6:          03:37:22       Yeah, I've got a youtube channel cycle. Uh, it's, it's just Dakota Meyer. So I've got the youtube channel, just Dakota Meyer where my podcast goes up. It's on, on the dash on the dash. What does that mean? Uh, so, you know, own the dash comes from a point when to Ellis had wrote called the Dash. And, uh, you know, I, I felt like I felt like people in America just needed something to hold onto. And uh, you know, so I always look at what is success and how do I want to be remembered. And that's kind of like a big thing for me. And I, uh, so Linda Ellis wrote an appointment, talked about how like at a funeral, you know, what man, so to speak, and you referred to the dates, you know, on the tombstone from the beginning or you know, with the, the date he, the person was born the day he died.

Speaker 6:          03:38:03       And really those are the two only two days in your life that you don't make any decisions or have any control of and everything else. What matters that dash in between. And so how are you going to own your dash? What is your dash going to look like? Because you can control that. You can control what that dash looks like, how you know how fulfilling it is, how selfish it is, how giving it is. I mean, you control it by your decisions every single day. And what do you want your dash to look like? How do you want to be remembered? Because it doesn't matter how much money you have, it doesn't matter how whatever you did, the empires you built, what matters is how you change people's lives and that's how you're remembered. And where your true success in my mind is you'll be defined, will be what people say about you at your funeral.

Speaker 6:          03:38:46       And so that's where it comes to me is his own the dash. It's where the idea of it came from. So own your dash, you know, and you do public speaking as well. I do. I do. Public speaking, I go around and do get in there and talk to businesses and teams. Yeah. You know, I come in and talk to businesses, teams, give my leadership principles of, you know, what I believe to make success. You know, listen, I'm simple though. Um, but you know what, what I feel like, you know, my life, I talk about my story and kind of what happened, me. And then I come around and I, what does that mean to me? Right. What does that mean? Like, you know, every story without, uh, every story or experience that you go through that doesn't have a meaning afterwards is a wasted experience. And, uh, so I talk about that and I just, you know, did a lot, did a lot of public speaking, trying to, I just wanna inspire people. I'm like, I just, you know, I

Speaker 1:          03:39:34       just want to, honestly, I just want to change the world. No big deal. Just want to change the world. That's it. No, I just want to change the world. Awesome man. Awesome. And he did. I, did I miss anything else? No, I don't think so. I think that's, I think that's everything. Yeah. Anything, any other projects or anything else everybody needs to know about?
