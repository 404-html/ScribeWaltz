Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 55 with echo journals and me, Jocko Willink. Good evening. Echo could evening. Well, our last podcast, which I guess is no surprise at this point when a little loan did he not have room for Q and. A. So because of that we have, we will dedicate podcast number 55 today to Q and a questions from the inner webs. Thanks to everyone that has submitted questions through the interwebs so that we can attempt to answer some of them. Yeah. And with that Echo Charles. Yes. Questions from the interwebs. What do you got? Well, first question is how important is purpose, reason or cause and being successful like the Perp, your purpose, right?

Speaker 1:          00:01:06       Well, clearly purpose and reason and cause are extremely important. This is, this is the why of of your actions. This is knowing why you're doing what you're doing. This is the commander's intent. And so you, you absolutely, absolutely. These are important. If you don't know why you're doing something well then let me ask you a question. Why are you doing something he does? It's very clear. It's very simple to understand. So yeah, you got to know, if you don't know why you're doing something and didn't, what were you going to do when you hit an obstacle, you're going to stop. What do you, what adaptations are you going to make when things go wrong to overcome them? You're not going to make any cause you don't know why you're doing it. Yeah. So if you have no reason, if you have no reason for doing something, you're not going to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:50       So you got to have a longterm goal. You've got to understand the underlying purpose of what you're doing. Now this doesn't necessarily meaning that it mean that it has to be rigid because it doesn't have to be rigid. You know, I'll tell you an interesting case as an example I'll give you is my own case, right? So of course, you know, I'm all about planning in, in always having a longterm plan and all that stuff. But to be honest with you, the situation that I'm in right now as a human, I didn't have a long term plan for this. You know the, the, the, I, you know, Lafe and I wrote the book, I had no intention of writing a book that kind of happened, you know, cause people were asking us and as we worked with businesses, they said you have this stuff written down.

Speaker 1:          00:02:38       So we ended up writing the book. Once we wrote it, we thought maybe we'd be handing it out when we go and work with companies. Literary agent saw today, let me, let me show this to some publishers. Publishers on said, let, let us publish this. Okay, so you figure you're going to publish it. Well, even when you're published a book, you don't expect it. A bunch of people are going to read it. You expect that you could have a book published and that's cool. But it ended up doing really well. So that kind of happened with that. All of a sudden I was on a couple podcasts. Well, I didn't, you know, I didn't have any intention when I went on Tim Ferriss, his podcast, I didn't say to myself, this is going to propel me into my own podcast, or Joe Rogan's part didn't say, now if you know Joe Rogan's going to launch me into the podcast world.

Speaker 1:          00:03:16       No. Hmm. I didn't expect that, but it happened and you know what? It happened. It made sense to me. Okay, these two guys are squared away. They're square to wait in this particular genre and they're recommending my mind is open. Okay, let's try and make a podcast. Did I know that the podcast was going to be super popular now? I just thought we were making a podcast so that you know, the few people want would want to listen to it. Cool for, I mean then look what happens. Next thing you know we're, we're making tea. You don't know the next thing I'm making tea. I had no, no idea that that ti would be part of my world. So all this stuff happened, right? But, but the goal, really the underlying, the reason for me doing all this is still the same through the whole thing.

Speaker 1:          00:04:04       And that is that I want to help people. I want to help people with something that, the lessons that I've learned, I want to help them. So how can I do that? Well, you write them down. Okay. You wrote it down so people can read it. Great. How else can you help them? Oh, you can make a podcast so people can access it easily and cheaply. Cool. Here you go. So the underlying go, oh, you know, I want people to be healthy. Well, what's a good way to be healthy? Stop drinking monster energy drinks. Stop Drinking Red Bull 12 a day and it's our drinking something that's healthier. Oh, okay, cool. Jocko white tea. Next thing you know, that's what we've got going on. So it's, it's, that's been my, that's been my goal and I haven't really, even though I, even though I strayed from what maybe the original path I thought I was going to take, I still stayed.

Speaker 1:          00:04:50       My reason is the same. And I think that's what I'm saying. When your reason is clear and your purpose is clear, that's going to make your drive clear and that's gonna make you execute well because you know where you're going, you know you where you want to be, you understand your purpose and why you're doing something and that's what's gonna help you be successful in my opinion. Do you think that like, oh, um, you know, people, they'll be like, this is my why and it'll be like their kids or something like that. Do you think that falls within this like, you know, like reason, purpose and all this stuff? Yeah, I think, I think that that's the same, this same general, the guy could've said purpose, reason. Cause why? I think that the question could have said that. I think that if your purpose is your kids really clear example, right?

Speaker 1:          00:05:39       I have a lot of people might say that. Well, that's cool. But that's, you're going to have to clarify that a little bit more because if your purpose is your kids then quit your job and just spend all day with your kids, well then obviously you're not supporting your kids. Cause now you can't afford to buy him food. So your, your goal should be taking good care of and providing for your children's now and in the future. Wow. Okay. Now that makes sense. Now you're looking longterm, short term, you gotta you know that you have to work hard now. You don't have to make investments for them. So that, that's the kind of thing that's beyond just a simple, I'm doing this for my kids. Cause what are you doing for your kids? What are you trying to achieve for him?

Speaker 2:          00:06:14       Yeah. So like for using that example, like this is my why, it's my daughter, it's less. This is why I'm, you know, I don't know, writing a book, it's more, this is why I can endure the hard days or this is why I'm going to continue to work hard kind of thing out. Whatever it is I'm doing.

Speaker 1:          00:06:33       Yeah. And I just have an underlying yes and underlying reason. That's, that's a question that I think that's the answer. Yes. Yeah, it's pretty, actually, I should've just answered that in two words. I should have said. How important is purpose, reason cause and being successful? Answer. Very important. There you go.

Speaker 2:          00:06:50       You can have a lot of different reasons to, you know, or like a few core reading more than one.

Speaker 1:          00:06:55       Yeah. You know what I'd say if there's anything to be taken away from this question, ed is if you don't feel, here's the, here's the, I would say the takeaway. If you don't feel some kind of drive in your life, if you don't feel passionate about something, if you feel like you're wandering in, meandering through the world, then it's time to assess. Then it's time to say, okay, what is my reason? What am I trying to do? What would I like to do in the world? Now we get something valuable here. We all know that you got to have a purpose so y'all didn't get out of reason. So if you feel yourself meandering down the path with no reason, no purpose, dig in and find one.

Speaker 2:          00:07:35       Next question. I want to begin training in Jujitsu, but financial constraints dictate that I can keep my gym membership to keep getting after it at 4:00 AM or begin training Jujitsu, but not both.

Speaker 1:          00:07:53       Oh, it's a black and white question. Is it one or the other? Okay. First of all, check around your area and see if there's a gym that has both. Right. I know that's one of the reasons that we created my gym. Victory. MMA. There's an an fitness on there too. Yup. Cause no matter what you want to do, if you're in the game, you can do it there. You can do striking, you can do Jujitsu or you can do wrestling, you can do boxing, you can do weightlifting, all kinds of crossfit. You can do Olympic lifting, you can do power lifting, you can do calisthenics. You could, so you knew everything there. That's why we created the gym. And you, it's not more expensive than a straight Jujitsu gym where it's not more expensive than a straight crossfit gym. It's actually cheaper than most of both foes.

Speaker 1:          00:08:35       So look around, see if you have a gym that has both any fee. If there is no gym around there that has both, maybe you do what I did. And you start a gym that has both, right? I mean you could do that. I did it, did it with some of my buddies said, hey, you know what? We want to, we want to train all the time and all these different aspects. How can we do that? Can we go to one at, you know, four o'clock in the afternoon. We have to go to another gym at five o'clock then we have to go to another gym at seven o'clock do we want to do that? No. So what do we do? Make our own gym. Make it what we want. And guess what? When you do something like that in the business world, if you, if you, I think, I think Tim Ferriss said, scratch your own itch, right?

Speaker 1:          00:09:13       You have an itch that you want to scratch. There's other people that are going to have the same match and that's what happened with our gym. So everyone goes, yeah, I want to train. Of course I want to drain. So maybe you start your own gym and Oh, you're not a skilled boot, a Brazilian jujitsu practitioner. Guess what? For the first time ever in America, there's actually a bunch of really good Jujitsu practitioners in, maybe you couldn't get a black belt to come to where you live. Maybe you could cause there's a good chance you're good, but a brown belt, purple belt, they can be a good or great instructor. Yeah. So you might open up a gym and start that. Now that doesn't mean also that you have to make a huge investment to do that. You could start off with your garage and some mats.

Speaker 1:          00:09:58       So that's an idea. Another thing you could do for you. Okay, so that doesn't exist. How would you find Jujitsu is, this is a tough one, right? We want to stay healthy, we want to stay fit, but you Jitsu is kind of the priority. It's kind of the priority. Don't tell you why it's learning, right? If you take, if you take me and you and we go through this situation and you decide that you're going to do Jujitsu and I decided I'm going to weight lift in 10 years, who's happy and who's sat? We know the answer. The answer's clearly now I start because I now I have enough money. So six years into it I started training Jujitsu and you're a brown belt or a black belt and I don't have this knowledge and it's going to take me six years to get there.

Speaker 1:          00:10:41       Meanwhile you, while you were training, guess what else you were doing? You were doing calisthenics, you were sprinting, you are, you are lifting rocks, you are doing cheap stuff for free and you're still getting a massive benefit. So for me, my priority is going to go to the Jujitsu because you can go and spend $40 on a set of rings for your garage or your basement or your hallway. And next thing you know you can do pull ups, you can do dips, you can do muscle ups, you can do squats and sprints all day long. You don't need anything for that. So you can get a massive benefit with a set of rings or you can just get a pull up bar and you can just do pull ups and you go to Home Depot and buy a pipe and a couple nails and nail it into the wall and you've got to pull a bar.

Speaker 1:          00:11:27       Now you can do pull ups, push ups and squats and you're good to go. You could become a beast with those exercises, so I would prioritize and at do that, I would prioritize the Jujitsu and I'd make some kind of a home gym or I'd go to all why MCA or some cheaper kind of gym. The other thing you go to do your Jujitsu school and become the mop person. Start cleaning up our mob and maths. That's another thing you can do to make this happen. Maybe you can get a little deal cut at both places. Most gym places that you know, if you go in there and say, hey look, I, I need, I can't afford this right now. What can you do for me? Maybe they'll cut you some kind of a deal. Yeah. The other thing that you can likely do. Now you're saying you don't have the budget for this situation.

Speaker 1:          00:12:14       What is it in your budget right now that you can cut out? Yeah, that's my question. And the funny thing is what can you cut out coffee? A lot of people drink two or $3 worth of coffee a day. Probably even more than that. I don't know. You're a coffee drinker. You are going to trigger how, how much, how much does a coffee addict to drink a day from Starbucks? Yeah. That's the spectrum. And the, you know, the, but we're talking Starbucks cups a day. Yeah. If you're going to Starbucks and buying. Yeah. I think, I don't know. I don't buy it. Well, I get coffee from on it to be honest with you. So you can make your own at home and stuff. But um, but if someone would works near a Starbucks, they stop on the way to a gym membership. It's for four bucks a day.

Speaker 1:          00:12:57       So that's 120 bucks a month. Yeah. So boom, you cut out coffee or you make your own, make your own coffee and you're good to go. What about the nights that you go out to eat? You're like, oh, you know, I don't feel like cooking down. It'll go out and do it. A little restaurant that costs you 30 40 bucks a shot. Get rid of that Kate. Well, bunch of cable bill, your cable bill, you're watching TV, nothing. Zero productive. Coming out of that zero, you're not doing anything beneficial for yourself. Get rid of your cable. Next thing you know, you get rid of your cable and now you've got enough money for your gym membership. You know, sell another one cell phone usage, right? We rack up the big numbers on cell phone. What are you doing? What? What are you doing? Is it to surf the interwebs and get, you know, lose your mind.

Speaker 1:          00:13:40       So what can you cut down on that? Because I'm thinking now you could scrape away a little bit here and there. Just lower your plan and use your, use your phone less watching the UFC get into u of C's. I love the UFC, but instead of watching it at home for 50 bucks or 59 bucks, go to a bar and pay 10 bucks to get in and watch it there for 10 bucks. You just save 40 bucks or however many about bucks that was cause actually I want to try second. See, you know there's all kinds of movie night. What about the note? You want to go see the new movie in the theater? No, don't go see the new movie. The theater that costs. That's an expensive now, isn't it? Yes. Is it more than $10? I don't even remember. Less than, I think it's like 10 or 1511 yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:22       Well I went one time is the 11 that was is over a year ago though. Yeah. So cut that out. Bike to work, you know, do something to get you started shaving a little bit of money because in the long run, what you're going to get from these two things, from fitness and from Jujitsu are going to be going to have so much value in your life. There's going to be, they're going to be worth way more. What these little marginal things that you're cutting out are. Yeah. And that way, like in the beginning how you said like what is it that you can cut

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       out? So basically you're, you're identifying what is it right now that you're considering more important than you did two where the gym or whatever, which the term actual answer to that is nothing there. There's nothing more important than your life then your fitness and really your Jujitsu is part of your fitness and also its knowledge and its confidence in it's, yeah. Okay. Um, I know that people are gonna Freak out. Okay. I'm not saying it's the most important thing in your life in terms of, in terms of, of purchases that you can make. Yes. These two things are of the highest level. Now you need a car to get back and forth to work. Understood. You need a house for sleeping. Understood. You need food on the table. Understood. You need to take care of your family. Understood. As soon as you get into the optional things in life.

Speaker 2:          00:15:38       These are the top two. These are the top two. I think so too. And tell me I'm wrong, I don't, I'm not, I can't tell you you can get good. But when Phil, but making the, as far as making the decision goes your, you're essentially identifying what you currently are holding more important than it. Regardless of what you think is more important. Your, you got to identify it and the actions are a statement. Yeah. Yes. Of what you believe get and that I'm a big one too is like drinking. I got to know not everyone drinks. So who knows? I don't know. Some person might not drink at all, but if you buy a six pack of beer, let's say you do that, you know, I don't know, twice a week or something like that. That's like more than a gym members to that's your coffee thing is big too.

Speaker 2:          00:16:23       But yeah, there, yeah, there is a lot of little, little ways. The cable thing, I gotta be honest only because you're probably not the only one that watches TV. I know it, the argument is like, Hey, TV isn't good quote unquote for anybody, so everyone should just be signed on in the household kind of thing. So what's your point? It's not that easy all the time saying you know, like there is going to be some ripples in the, you know, especially when you first make that transition. If you choose to take it upon yourself to cut out cable because you want to go to Jujitsu. No. Oh. And you make everyone in your house. You improve everyone in your house mentally and physically. I know what it's like surgery. He got to make that initial incision and open up everything and make a mess before you can repair, you know, so that, that initial part is going to be most of the ways around that too.

Speaker 2:          00:17:10       You get Netflix or Hulu or one of those things that were, you get streaming on demand, right? The, which is kind of where everything's going anyway, really right now. Yeah. But yeah, there's some, there's some good stuff too. Good. So as far as the job, find a way to do both. It can be done. Know you can do it. Get creative. The home gym is good. That's good because that's something you could just start slowly and start adding to slowly four bucks. You've got rings. Don't have your start. Yeah, me, you'll be good to go for sure. Um, okay. Next question. Jocko had an incident. I wanted your opinion on love, your book booking podcast, always listening to apply your lessons to my life, job and family. I was driving home one night with my wife and four year old son in the car when some junk idiot was walking in the middle of the roadway.

Speaker 2:          00:18:02       He stood in front of my car refusing to move, running his mouth. My wife begged me not to get out of the car. Guy Reached in his front, reached into his front waistband like he had a gun and and although myself being a police officer and having countless incidents and experience like this, I didn't feel he did more like drunk and bravado or grandstanding any case. Those I was armed and having trained in boxing and a little bit of Jujitsu felt I could have handled this situation. This lasted about a minute of him standing there and eventually I just drove around him while he was running his mouth, calling me names and all that stuff. My first priority obviously is getting my family home safely and making sure nobody will ever do any harm to them. But another part of me felt like, what am I teaching my son? I mean, is that okay? Um, you know, is that okay to let people disrespect you and act any way they want towards you? So I dropped off my s uh, so I dropped off my family and went back looking for the guy. He was gone. I guess lucky for me as well as him.

Speaker 2:          00:19:08       I'm questioning my decision, not out of ego, but only because of the example I want to be to my son. That you never go looking for trouble and confrontation, but you don't back down from it

Speaker 1:          00:19:24       ever. Okay. Well just first of all, you one, just so you know, you won, you got a wife and a kid. Yeah, you won, right? So options or three options here. Well, for one, if you're a police officer, you could call the police. You could, you know, gone get on your radio and call them to say what's going on and have this guy arrested before he causes on the of an actual accident. Being out in the strode, like an idiot being out in the road like an idiot. So that's an option. But, but the other thing is like what are you trying to teach your son? Are you trying to teach your son that he should fight every idiot that offends him? He's, if you, if that's what you teach him, he is not going to have a very productive life or a very nice life.

Speaker 1:          00:20:18       So there's too many negatives, right? That can happen there. This actually happened to something similar to, this happened to me a little while ago. I was down by the ocean down by the pier in the neighborhood where I live and there was a like a tweaker crazy, you know, drunk on drugs and all that. And it was, it wasn't as direct as this. He wasn't, he wasn't saying anything at me, but he's yelling swear words and, and he's in front of my kid, my kid, this was when my son was probably six or seven years old and he's just alone and he's isolated, but he's swearing and just acting crazy. Right? And what I did was I said to my son, okay, you see this guy right here? Have you heard of what drugs are? This is what drugs do to you right here. This, this guy, this is where it ends up.

Speaker 1:          00:21:03       So this guy's a miscreant, he's a criminal. And the other thing I told him, I said, what if this guy attacks us? What do you think would happen? And my son was kind of, you know, will you would choke him cause my son trained to do two at that time. And he goes, well you would choke him. And I was like, that's right. I'm not afraid of this guy. We're not afraid of this guy. This is no factor because we know how to fight, we know how to defend ourselves. But that being said, what we want to do is we want to avoid the situation. You know, there's all kinds of, all kinds of bad things that can happen there. We know this, I told my son, like this guy could have a knife, Scott could have a gun. This guy could have, this guy could just have a blood borne disease, right?

Speaker 1:          00:21:45       This guy could have a bloodborne disease. Now I go and get in a fight with him and now I have a bloodborne disease. You know what? What, what, what? That's horrible. That's a horrible situation. So like I said, I told him that this is, this is why we train. This is why we know how to use firearms. Because when people are maniacs and if they're insane and psychopathic and they have weapons, you need to have a weapon yourself. You need to be able to defend yourself. So our PR, this is what I teach my son. My primary objective is to be safe, right? To, to not get to avoid these situations. And guess what? If you still feel the need to like be a man in the situation or prove that you're a man or proof to your son, that which is valuable. I'm not trying to put that down.

Speaker 1:          00:22:32       You want your son to see that, that, that you should be strong and that you should be able to stand up for yourself and that you will don't ever have to back down to anybody. But that's why your son comes with you to the gym. That's why he trains Jujitsu. That's why you train Jiu Jitsu. That's why he watches you day in, day out, day out, working out, being strong, being tough, going to the gym, training with firearms. That's why he sees all that stuff. So he knows. I mean, I'll tell you right now, my kids, if you were to ask my kids like against a random person in the street, they would, they pro basically think I could beat up anyone in the world. You know what I mean? That's the thing. Because as I said, me training all the time, right? That's all they see me do.

Speaker 1:          00:23:12       So, so that's that. Now the disrespect part, d disrespected me, right? Disrespect. And sometimes you know, disrespect me is one thing, but now you disrespect my wife, right? Well again, how can you be disrespected? And that's what I explained. I would explain to my son, you cannot just be disrespect, be disrespected by someone that has no respect for themselves. And if you are a drunk idiot in the street, you have no respect for yourself. You don't, you cannot disrespect me. It is impossible for you to give me disrespect and even respect yourself as a human. Right? So, so that's just, that's just added. It doesn't get any account. And I'll tell my son that all day long or, or any of my kids that all day long, you can't be disrespected by someone that doesn't even respect themselves. You know what I am respect. I'm even respectful to this drunk idiot, giving them the benefit of the doubt.

Speaker 1:          00:24:14       I am respect. So you know, then the other pieces, not backing down from trouble, right? And I'm not gonna back down from trouble, but I am going to avoid it. We're going, I'm going to avoid it. And you know what? Trouble avoids me. Kate avoids me. And if you are working now in you're staying strong and you have the confidence because you know you can handle yourself, trouble is going to avoid you 99% of the time. And the other thing is you got to tell your kids, I mean my son is getting older now. If he gets in a fight with someone he could kill them. I mean that's a straight up what could happen. And so now I've got an [inaudible] and you know he's a young kid so he's got a, he's got to do the things that you're talking about in this question.

Speaker 1:          00:25:07       Prove themself and prove that he's not going to back down. I was, I got to explain to them, listen, let me tell you what comes with getting in a street fight. A cool rush. Cause it's fun, right? It's fun. So you get that. Maybe you get a little bit of props, you get a little bit of respect from the, from the, you get accred right? Some street credit from your people. Let me tell you what else comes with it. Along with those two things, which are, which are cool, right? Possible jail time, possible injuries, possible lawsuits, the broken hand. I mean even if just, okay, those are the big ones, right? Jail time. Which there's been plenty of cases where there was a claim case here in San Diego. Guy Punched another guy, fell on the curb. Dead died. Right? Yeah. Those things really happen. Not to mention you could get, you know, so you get jail time, you get an injury.

Speaker 1:          00:25:56       Not, not to mention you could get killed, right? Cause you think you're a tough guy. Guess what? The greatest MMA fighters in the world get caught with a crack in the face and they get knocked out. You fall down and hit a curb. You, you could die. So there's that aspect too. But then you get to the injuries, right? Cause you're getting a street fight, you're going to get some kind of an injury, you're going to get some kind of an injury. It's just going to happen. You know, whether it's just a little cut or a little brazen and you're going to have something that's a pain. It could be a major injury. You could break your hand. That happens all the time, lawsuits because now you're going to get sued. Now they're coming after you and if you, it's just a stupid thing like a rip jacket or a scuff me.

Speaker 1:          00:26:30       It just isn't worth it. It isn't worth it. Especially because we're talking about an individual that you can crush in an instant and that has no value as a human in this account. What this person's doing, none. This person is an idiot. Don't go down to their level and play that game. Instead, avoid that and go to the gym and train more and be ready. Yeah. That's my opinion. Good job on walking away, going out to find the guide. Luckily you already said, luckily you didn't find him because right now who knows? Maybe you'd be the guy that's on you. You're going to jail. The cop that, oh, you're a cop and you were armed and you went and got in a fight with this guy and you've pulled your weapon because you were losing it. And he shot him. And then what do we see when she's somebody that had cell phone and they recorded the whole thing and they see you pushing this guy around. Yeah. It's not a good situation. And you gotta be ultra responsible when you're carrying ultra responsible when you're carrying, you know that we all know that when we carry, we got to avoid. That's, that's what we have to do when we're packing. Wow. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:34       Yeah. And you can kind of tell when someone's scared. You know, when like if this guy and a guy in the street and you're in the car, that's another, that seems real obvious. You drive around and you go home, but it's, you know, it's someone's like, get it. Like if you're walking on the sidewalk and he gets in your way, that's, you know, it's kind of different and whatever, but avoiding the situation. Yeah. And you're not scared because you prepared to whatever and you, you simply walk around or go the other way or something like that. The people with you, they can tell, they can tell you, not scared. You can tell that you're making the right decision, but if you are scared, whether you fight the guy or you run away scared, they can tell that too. Yeah. So I had another situation the other day, I was walking out street with my whole, well yeah with, with my whole family thing going to get some ice cream.

Speaker 1:          00:28:19       It was, it was a couple months goes in the summertime going to get some ice cream. Haley had a discipline, disciplinary breakdown in my own mentality, which you're going to get ice cream. So we're walking down the street and out of nowhere this guy just gets in my like stood up and got in my face with really fast and I just kinda looked at him and sort of did the, you know, into the um, semi, not a full on fight stance but I turned, you know, like a quarter turn and just looked at him because I thought, okay, we're going to rock and roll, we'll make this happen. And it almost instantly what happened, what you just described happened as soon as the guy got in my face, he like immediately within one, within a half a second immediately backed down and walked away. It was like he was just trying to prove something.

Speaker 1:          00:29:08       Then you realize really quick he was going to get crushed. But anyways, that's the same thing. You know, the guy could tell, oh you want to fight, you know, if you're telling that story about Euler Euler, Gracie coiler told me this story and I guess you know when there's a really good surfer and Euler was out surfing at a spot in San Diego and San Diego, like all surfing areas is, is pretty um, territory, territorial. And there's some, there's some are some aggression in the surf. And anyways, some guy started getting aggressive with, with boiler and oh and they're said to him some classic line. It was something along the lines of, hey man, you surf for a living. I fight for a living. If you want to go to the beach, let me know. Otherwise be quiet. I thought that was a great line. Nicely done. Holding bread this time we went up.

Speaker 1:          00:30:04       But it's the same, you know, boilers small for those of you who don't know who boiler, Gracie isn't wholly there is a small small guy and he's obviously a master of Jujitsu but he's only 150 pounds, 155 pounds maybe. Really small guy. And he's a nice guy. So he's not a guy that, he's not a guy that's going to be intimidated. He's not, he's not his looks are not going to intimidate anybody. I don't even think he has cauliflower ears. I mean it's just, he just looks like a nice guy and he is a nice guy and he's got a nice presence about him. So what I'm saying is what again, to reinforce what you just said, when someone is confident to that level, even though there are 145 or 150 pounds and look like a nice guy with a smile on her face, when you confidently say, look, you know what I do for living, I fight. If you want to go to the beach and fight, let me know. And the guy says, Oh, you know what? I'm good. I'm good. I'll just leave you alone. That sounds like a plan.

Speaker 2:          00:30:55       Yeah, the little detector goes off like danger, danger. I'm going to get my ass beat. But, and some, but some guys are, as far as decision making goes, some guys are crazy. You know where like how you said like if they're like on drugs or this guy in this case if you sit in the middle of the road acting like you know boys in the hood kind. We've got a problem here. That's what he said he was doing. Like he's obviously off, you know like he's not a decision maker kind of thing. So you know, if you jump into a situ situation with them, it's kind of unpredictable in that weird way, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:31:28       Let me tell you something else. Let's say the guy has a gun or doesn't have a gun. You had the moment to get away from it. Yeah. If you thought he had a gun, you get away from him, right? Let's say you said, Oh you know what? I'm going to confront him right now. So you, let's say you get in a shootout, you kill him. Guess what you got to do now? You got to hire a lawyer, you got to hang up, you got to take a break from work cause you're a copy. There's all these things, so not worth it. It's just a pain in the ass is what it is. It's

Speaker 2:          00:31:55       almost like, I mean, maybe I'm wrong here, but it's almost like you can't, like what? What's the thing, what's the goal we're going for when we go ask question today? What's the, what's your reason why your reason for doing this, I'm going to go out and look for, I'm going to look for the guy, but then like what's the goal? Like what's the outlook? What are we going for there when we go look for him to tell him not to do that again or to what? To arrest them or to kick his ass or belief, right. What's going on. Yeah. And then even that you don't, a lot of times we don't. I know when you're in that moment, you don't think past that. You're just like, I gotta get my whatever, my revenge really is what it is. He shouldn't have done that to me.

Speaker 2:          00:32:32       I'm going to go teach them a lesson kind of a thing. I mean, that's the feeling. I don't know. Yeah, but guys are weird, man. You can jump into that weirdness spreads. Go home with your family and watch when the confrontation happens. The best case scenario isn't good. The best case scenario, if you jump in there, just the best case scenario that's going to happen. It isn't good. Yeah, because you got, even if you walk up and knock the guy out with one clean punch, you got to, you got a broken finger, you know you've got a broken knuckle. Even if you walk up and choke the guy, you got his grimy puke all over it. You know what I mean? It's just there. There's nothing that good is going to come out of it other than it feels good to fight. But that can easily be remedied by going to the gym and finding all of your buddies.

Speaker 2:          00:33:18       And in this case, I don't know, you know this guy, oh, you, you'd knocked out a weird homeless guy in the, in the middle of the road, in front of your family. Like I don't see how that's cool. Yeah, I know that. I mean, maybe, I don't know if that would feel good. I don't think so. Yeah. But yeah, it's kind of weird. This one time we went on this cruise and it was me, Terry, Tim, you know, it's kind of like Terry's huge, like I'm kind of big or whatever. Tim and art or girlfriends, this guy was behind us in the booth. We were at a restaurant or something and um, we were like, what are, I guess the booths were flimsy, so we're shaking the booth. He was behind us. He got up all crazy. It's like, Hey, what did he say? He said, yeah, you guys are big, but you guys keep knocking the booth.

Speaker 2:          00:34:01       We're going to basically called us out to a fight. He had like tattoos everywhere on his neck and stuff. And at first I was like, man, is this good joking? Like we're like, what's going on? I was confused and to be honest, I was like stunned. Like almost like I didn't, this scenario was so foreign to me. Oh, styling and not even know what to say. I don't even know what everyone else was doing. That's how stunned I was. But then Tim, he was Kinda, he stuck and stuff. So he was like, it's just a series right now. He just jumped out east that he likes stands up, goes to final, but the guy was a Weirdo. That's the thing. It was like all of us big guys, you know, and Tim was like, he wasn't scared at all. He was ready to fight. So he gets in his face face there about if I want us cruise by the way we're fighting.

Speaker 2:          00:34:42       You can't fight on a cruise. No. So it's this big scene, you know, and the guy like, he was like, I don't know, I guess he was ready to die or something cause he was like Kinda down the fight and guys came in like I think broke it up or whatever. We had to make this big report and he was like this big thing. So it was all just a pain in the ass is basically what we're saying. You're right. I'm saying like what if we fought that guy, you know, they taught him a lesson or what if Tim father or whatever getting arrested and you got a lawsuit against him and we were on a cruise Zachary. It's all stupid. Yeah, don't do that. Can stuff. Next question. Jackie loved the podcast part of the question. Oh, thank you. Right on. Any suggestions for leading command staff to understanding the ground level troops in a mission? Okay, so for those of you that are not in the military command staff, that's sort of for the business world, that would

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       be like corporate headquarters. You know the corporate headquarters, you've got the command staff and it happens in both situations where you end up with, with the command staff, with the corporate headquarters that kind of loses track of what, what they're actually therefore the ground level mission, the troops that are on the ground. And this is a tough question, but it's also kind of a simple one. So I go back to trying to constantly remind people what the mission is, what are they trying to do. And I had to the admiral and I was the admiral's aid. I worked for the admiral, great guy. And one of the things, I've probably talked about this before, but one of the best things that he did was cause he's, he's so detached from the seal platoons. Like there's layer upon layer upon layer in between him and them.

Speaker 1:          00:36:28       And, and actually believe it or not, the job of the admiral that's in charge of the seal teams, this is gonna sound strange to everybody. The job of the admiral that's in charge of the seal teams is to get equipment and gear and training for the seal teams now and for like the next 10 years because that's the way the budgetary process works in the Pentagon. And there's so, so don't think of when you think I know you, you want to think of the seal admiral as the warfighter. Let's go in forward. The guy that's actually in charge, the senior seal. Now there you can be a special operations because there's other places you could be, but the guy that's in charge of the seals of, of naval special warfare command, that's what it's called, naval special warfare command. The adults in charge of that, which puts them in charge of all the seals.

Speaker 1:          00:37:20       That guy, his main, his, his job is to train and equip seals, train and equip, not take them into battle but train and equip and so you end up with this whole organization where the purpose of the organization is to train and equip, but the organization is huge and even that command organization gets very big and so what they start doing is they start losing focus that 10 levels below them out somewhere overseas is, is an eight man squad and a Zodiac off the coast of some nation. Doing a reconnaissance is very, they, they don't even think about, they haven't thought about that for years and so they lose track and it happens in the corporate world as well where the the the head shed that's, they're dealing with stuff too, right? They're dealing with legal problems, they're dealing with compliance problems. They're dealing with financial problems.

Speaker 1:          00:38:12       They lose track of the fact that there's a guy on the front line that's trying to fix a car or replace a an air conditioner, you know, that's the way it is. So you lose the vision of that, you lose track of that. So what was great about this animal that I work for is in these big meetings where they would be talking about s, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars of expenditures over the next 12 years, various training commands and all this stuff. Huge. And he would always, he would always say, how does this impact a seal platoon overseas? How does this, how does this help a seal assaulter go out and shoot a bad guy in the face? That's what he would ask. And that gives them snaps. Everybody snaps everybody back into reality of what they're get. It connects exactly what this question is. Um, suggestions for leading command staff to understanding the ground level troops.

Speaker 1:          00:39:05       And you've got to ask that question and the business side of seeing the same thing. You know, the guys totally lose track of it. So, so you, you ended up, you got to ask the question, hey, everything that you're talking about, you know, this, this compliance thing and this regulatory thing and this new software that you're talking about. Let me ask you a question. How is this going to help one of our frontline sales people close a deal? That's the question. That's the whole reason that we're here. The whole reason that this big staff is here, the whole reason we have this building, the whole reason we have this base is so that a seal overseas can close with and destroy the enemy or so, or if we're in a big corporation is so that this repairman can make it to a, a house and fix an electrical problem in a short period of time, efficiently and effectively.

Speaker 1:          00:39:55       That's what we're all here for. So I think that's what you have to do. You have to keep reminding them of what's going on down on the phone lines, what the mission is, what the men are doing, what issues are out there. Another thing you could take is you want to take these people with you or you want to get anecdotal information. That's, I know it's cheap, it's cheap to do this, but you go out and you gather anecdotal information that you can bring back to headquarters and say, Hey, you know what? I know we're all doing a good job here. Let me tell you, the troops on the ground need this cold weather gear right now. They don't have it. Here's a, here's a message. I just got bumped from a guy overseas. They're up in northern Iraq. We thought it was going to be warm.

Speaker 1:          00:40:32       Guess what? It's 32 degrees there. Snow on the ground. These guys aren't prepared for it. We need to get into gear. Okay, so you're using anecdotal information to, to paint the picture of what's going on in the front lines. Same thing with, you know, if you're a corporate guy and you want to make sure people stay engaged, go out on a call with that electrician that's visited in a house on a, on it where there's been a break or have blown. And the guys working through the payment system that you devise that you thought was so smart, it doesn't get connection while you're out in the field and now he can't run a credit card. You want to come back and tell them, tell the head shed that. So those are some of the things. Another thing that you could do is you asked those questions all the time and maybe you just come up with some kind of a mantra that you repeat all the time and that you sign your emails with.

Speaker 1:          00:41:15       It says, you know, we're here to support, we're here to support the front line guys. We're here for the front line. You know, or ask yourself the question, does this help the front line? Every decision that we make, we got to ask herself, does this help our front line? Does this help our frontline personnel? Um, and I think that's what you gotta do. Now. One thing that you've gotta be ready for on this, you gotta be ready for someone to say, Dave, don't understand the big picture. This is what you got to be ready for it. Cause I've heard this well, who's going to say that? Corporate. Oh you go to the corner and say, look, you know we've got the guys on the front lines. We need to get them this gear. And they go, look, they don't understand the big picture. We can't afford that right now. We didn't look okay. I hear what you're saying.

Speaker 1:          00:41:59       But be ready for it. It's an excuse. It's an excuse and you gotta be ready for it in the way that you get ready for it. I've talked about this and they only get in times the way you get ready for, as you have ammunition, you have ammunition. You've got to have your ducks in a row. If you're going to raise your hand and say, Hey, here's what's going on the front lines, here's, here's a problem that they have. You can't, but you can't just back down. When they say, hey, they don't know what's going on. They don't get it. They don't get the bill. That's a big thing. They say in the military, they don't get the big picture. I would hear that threaten and say, you know what, actually we do get the big picture. We're living the big picture. You don't get the big picture.

Speaker 1:          00:42:28       Here's the big picture. I got frontline troopers that need cold weather gear or they're going to freeze and not be able to operate. The picture doesn't get any bigger than that. Now you can't call it of course, come across like that and which you have to do is you have to look at it systematically and over a long term and say, this is about plan and I've got a plan for the long term of how are we gonna get these guys as cold weather gear in the future. But right now we've got a little fixed. It's going to cover these guys that are in the field right now. You've got to come armed with ammunition so that you can, you can refute this. Common call that gets made, which is they don't understand the big picture out in the field, so don't worry about them. No. The only reason we're here is for those guys in the field. So what's her number them?

Speaker 3:          00:43:12       That's pretty good. Next question.

Speaker 1:          00:43:20       You talk about stepping back or detaching to better assess situations. Can you expand on how

Speaker 3:          00:43:28       you detach?

Speaker 1:          00:43:30       Okay, so this is again, this is one I've been asked. I probably, even if I answered this before, yes. Should we just skip it? Uh, no. I think it's worth it, you know? Okay, I'll, I'll go over. I'll go over quickly since people ask me all the time. Okay. First of all, you wanted to attach step back, literally step back. If you're online with a bunch of people in a combat situation, literally step back. If you're, if you're in a combat situation, high port, your weapon, your weapon at the seat, at the roof, at the sky, whatever, you're not going to engage in your target. You're gonna step back. If you're in a, if you're in a business environment, step away from the computer, step away from the terminal, put down your pen back away. There's a year and a meeting, heated meeting you need to attach, stand up back away from the table, but it's literally stand back and step away. Once you do that,

Speaker 1:          00:44:21       you, you relax. Now that, that physical part that I just talked about, it literally stepping back, that's something that it's a, it's a physical reminder of what to do. You can get to a point in your life where you don't need to do that. Yeah. Or where you usually don't have to do that, but things can still escalate quickly to where even the most highly trained detached person still lasts it step back and take up, take a wrap off and take a look around. So in most of these situations is, especially when you're first starting to try and do it physically, step back, physically do something that indicates to you as a person and it actually indicates to everyone around you that you're doing this. Like when somebody stands up from the table and steps back. It's an indicator. Okay. He's, he's taking the wrap off, right?

Speaker 1:          00:45:07       You're Madec we get it. Yeah. Actually we're trying not to be dramatic, but it's going to be dramatic anyway. It is now. Take a breath, take a breath, look around and make a call. That's, that's it. That's how easy it is to detach. Now the actual hard part of detachment is being self aware enough that you know when to detach the, that's the, that's the challenging part because they end up in this situation. By the time, by the time they go, man, I should have detached. Yeah, that's right. You should have detached. You lost your temper. You got involved. He couldn't make a decision. You got dragged into the weeds like everybody else did. It's it's, if somebody, if I would have, and I've done this plenty of times when I was training seal platoons, I would just go up to the leader who was getting dragged her situation.

Speaker 1:          00:45:50       I'd be like, Hey, step back with me. I'd take them two steps off the line of like look around and then they'd be easily be able to make a decision. That's the, that's the easy part. The easy part is step. Stepping back. The hard part is knowing that you need to do it because it's like, I guess it's, and then to use the stupid analogy of the boiling frog, right where you put a bowl, you put a frog in water, you slowly start to boil it. Next thing you know it's next thing get knows it's dead. It didn't realize that though where if you throw it into hot water it would just try and jump out immediately. It's the same thing here. You don't, you'll get walk into a room and the chaos is going on. No, you walk into the room and everything seems okay and then it starts to escalate, escalate, escalate and next thing you know you're in it and next thing you know something bad has happened and you didn't detach and time.

Speaker 1:          00:46:31       So you lost the bubble and you lost control and everything went sideways. So you got to know when you got to understand when it is you needed to adapt. You've got to have your own personal red flags to tell you that it's time to relax. When you feel yourself getting frustrated, we just start getting like that. You needed to detach. When you feel you're, if you're getting foster to go back cut to detach, you've started feeling the anger, you're feeling the white knuckles or you start pecking hard at the keyboard, right? Right. When you type an email out and you're hitting the keyboard hard, that's an indicator to cater for you better not hit send because whatever you wrote isn't good. It's not going to solve any problems. You're raised voice, right? You start raising the voice. You start getting angry and agro with people. Those are the little things. Those are the little indicators that tell you you need to detach. Step back, take a breath, look around, walk out of the room, put your weapon at high port. Just relax. Look

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       around. Make a call. One more thing. Sometimes. Sometimes what? What? The reason you need to detach is just so you can see something from a different angle and you can ask a question. I love, I personally love doing this. I'm in a in a meeting, right? And I work with a bunch of businesses and it actually gets pretty, you know, I'm getting involved in what they're doing and they'll be all basically staring at a problem, right? Staring at a problem and they can't figure out what the solution, whether it's a leadership problem or a process problem, and they're all staring at this problem and they can't come to a solution while I come in. First of all, I'm totally detached, right? It's, it's one of the benefits of my job is I'm totally detached. So when I come in, a lot of times my, what I bring to the situation of what I can see is I can just ask a question that none of them could think to ask because they're all looking in the same direction. As soon as you flank that idea, you see it from a different angle. You come up with a solution. So, so what I'm my point in this is don't only use detachment to prevent your emotions from driving your decisions. Also use detachment as part of your creative process to detach from your current thought pattern and move to a new thought pattern where you can create new ideas and different plans from different angles that we're not seen from your previous vantage point.

Speaker 1:          00:49:16       Good. I guess we did get a little bit out of that to dance meant there. Yeah. Revisit revisitation

Speaker 3:          00:49:27       next question.

Speaker 1:          00:49:31       How to deal with people who use military vets status to excuse bad behavior in civilian world. Yeah. This is an unfortunate one to have to answer and it unfortunately, I have to start it off with the same way I made this point about Jujitsu and Jujitsu practice practitioners not necessarily being good people. Oh yeah. Unfortunately it's the same thing with veterans. Just like it's the same thing in every aspect of life. Just because someone is a veteran does not mean that they are a good person and being at war is certainly not an excuse for bad behavior. And I, couple of examples, couple of examples just to think about major, Major Kurt Chu evenly. You remember this guy, navy cross. This is the guy that wore the pink at at in John's, so his men could identify him. The enemy, you can identify him clearly too, but he was the leader. He saw hell right. Wounded men died. 27 of his men made it. I mean, just ridiculous. Guess what he did when he, when he got out of the Marine Corps, went to work for an insurance company for 20 years. Right? So Joe Owen, Joe Owen, who, you know, same, same chosen reservoir battle, never regain the use of the, of his arm that was wounded, was medically retired from the marine corps. Guess what he did with all that [inaudible] horror. Guess what he did? Yeah. He created and ran his own marketing business until I retired.

Speaker 3:          00:51:12       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:51:14       Now you remember John Chafee from that book, the coldest war. He was the captain that I kind of wanted. The reason I did that book was cause he was profiled in there and he just was a great leader. Well, I, I don't even know if I were, I don't remember if I talked about this, but he turned 20 years old at the bottle of Guadalcanal, right? World War II. He fought at [inaudible] World War II. Then he went to, went back and went to school with, I went to either Yale or Harvard or both, but then Korea kicked off. So then went to Korea and got after it more. So all of this war, what did he do with all that? And came home, you know, became the mayor of Providence there and Rhode Island became the governor of Rhode Island and they became secretary of the navy. But so my point in saying these things is veterans are not broken humans.

Speaker 1:          00:52:05       They're not deranged people. They're just people. And they've seen some stuff in, most of them are Gary on and do awesome. The greatest generation, they get a good, great generation holds a World War II vets. They saw horrors of war. Guess what they did? Came home and dominated. That's what they did. So men and women can overcome the impact of war or, or at least they can learn to work with it. Because even if you, you know, you, even if you have those things that stress you out, okay, but guys learn how to deal with it. Of course that being said, war, it does leave a mark and obviously sometimes it can have a extremely negative effect. So if you know someone like that, well let's get those veterans some help if they need it in and get them some support. Also make sure you're not enabling this bad behavior. This is what you don't want to do. You don't want it. You don't want to enable this bad behavior. The vets that I meet, they're there, they're fired up, they're not, they're not complaining about anything they're getting after it.

Speaker 1:          00:53:19       Don't enable the bad behavior. It doesn't help anyone. And it's one of those things that it, it might make you feel better. It might make me feel better to, to help someone out and say, Hey, no, I understand cause you know, here's, let me enable your binge eating behavior some more. And it might make me feel better cause I feel like I've done a good deed. But you haven't done a good deed. You've actually not helped them at all. That's one thing. I think that's good if you find other vets for them to talk to because other vets will say, man, I understand bro. It's okay, but let's not dwell on that past stuff. Let's move forward. This guy's offering you a job or this guy has a, a job for you to do or this guy has a position you can feel do that.

Speaker 1:          00:54:00       Do that. Don't dwell on the past. The past is gone. Wars. Hell, I know now let's live in the heaven we got here in the United States of America. Let's, let's take advantage of that and not dwell on the past. You know what this is. This is another small thing, but I just hear so much about it. Um, from people. If you got somebody having listen to the podcast, to this podcast a year from a vet, every single day I hear from vets around America that are like, hey man, thanks. Thanks for having the podcast. Thanks for what you talk about. I get it, Bree. She ate it. Okay. I just, you guys just, you know, sent me a message today. He's like, look man, I didn't have a gun in my mouth, but he goes, I wasn't doing good. I'm on track. I'm trained in Jujitsu. Literally, I'm trying to Jujitsu, I'm in the gym.

Speaker 1:          00:54:53       I'm busting my ass and my job. Appreciate it. That's all it is. That's all it is. Cause I think when people listen, when vets listen, the podcast, they go, okay, cool. There's other people, they know we're, we're in the game together. They feel that they feel that connection and they know that they're not alone because that's the thing that's jacked up. Man. Veterans that get, they go to war and they come back and they go somewhere there where they're just not, there's no one there. Yeah. And all this is, is a big bullshit session. You know what I mean? Between, you know, a veteran that's in a book and I'm having a bullshit vet, a session with, with Joe Ellen, you know, that's what it is. And so I think guys, veterans, they hear that and they go, yeah man, I appreciate it. So have them listen to the podcast and, and that might be helpful to get them feeling like they're not alone out there.

Speaker 1:          00:55:45       Yeah, I would think that that's the main thing. Like people don't like, you don't understand me, you know, you don't understand like, I mean, not to sound too self, but like you don't understand how I feel about this. And even day to day stuff, like the way I'm seeing this right now, you don't understand. Yeah. So yeah, you ended up feeling like, I'm assuming that's what it seems like you guys ended up feeling alone and they're out there and they're like, and the other thing is they feel like people don't understand me. I'm here saying, you're right. They don't, they haven't been to war. And the, the experience of war is all over the place. I mean, I wouldn't even, I wouldn't even, I would shine, you know, I would shine major Kurt Chu inlays boots every day for the rest of my life if I had the opportunity to, like that guy has expired.

Speaker 1:          00:56:35       I mean, just, I, I'm not gonna, I'm not even the same ballpark. You know what I mean? Not even the same clothes, not clothes for what those guys went through it, that shows reservoir and it goes all the way down to some guy that, you know was overseas that was in the military, didn't even deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan. Not Their fault. They might've wanted to, but sometimes he just doesn't happen. Yeah. So the, the military experiences, all those things and you don't know what you're dealing with. But one thing we do know is that it is a common experience, you know, going to war. It does have some common threads to it. And I think that it is hard for people that haven't experienced it to understand, and it makes people feel a little bit like alone out there. So when they hear other vets talking about what goes on, they go, yeah man, all right, cool.

Speaker 1:          00:57:19       These are not abnormal feelings that I'm having and they can move on. And I don't know if I've really answered the question of, of how to deal with people who use their status as an excuse to bad behavior. I think just like any, anyone else, man, you gotta you gotta do your best to put them in their place. And I think what makes non veterans feel intimidated. And when I was a kid, I looked up to all the Vietnam veterans and I just thought these guys, whatever they, they could do no wrong in my eyes. You know, when I was a kid it's not, that guy's awesome that goes and I was a non, you know, that guy could do no wrong. And I think that's a feeling that a lot of civilians have. Like they don't want to approach the subject. And if you feel that way, it's understandable.

Speaker 1:          00:58:01       It's hard. But find some vets around that can help you, that can, it can help that person that can talk to them about what they're doing. I mean, you know, every company that I work with, there's veterans in every company. I work with some, you know, usually have multiple veterans, so find some other vendors. A lot of the one thing that's another cool thing that the companies do is within their company they'll have like a veteran program or a veteran club basically inside their company. That's another cool thing. Do that, get that thing started. You know, even if you're not a vet, find the senior vet or the vet that's fired up to do it. Bring him in and then those guys can get together, talk and talk about doing better and talk about bringing some of their military experience to bear in the company and it just will turn out good. So there's little veterans organizations, that's what they call them. Veterans organizations inside of companies are pretty cool. I've spoken to a few of them. It's a pretty cool deal. All right, next question.

Speaker 1:          00:58:53       How does default aggressive apply to Jujitsu? Or does it apply to judge it? Well, good question now. Well, first of all, it doesn't apply during training. Okay. It, but it completely applies during competition and obviously it applies in the streets. So, so this is what I mean by that is in training it's okay to get in bad positions. It's okay to let things happen. It's okay let somebody grabbed that color or grab that sleeve or get across sites. Okay. I mean those, it's okay to put yourself at risk in competitions. That's okay. Matter of fact, it's, it's encouraged in a lot of weight training and training. It's encouraged in training, but in competition you can't do that. You, you can, you can not do that in street. You definitely cannot do that. And in fact, in the street, you've got to proactively and aggressively, first of all, avoid the bad situation.

Speaker 1:          01:00:04       But if they come, then you've got to handle those situations with aggression and speed and violence of action. That's what you gotta do. So competition is kind of the same way in competition. If you give a guy an inch, if you give a guy a grip, if you give a guy a position, they will not, they will not let go of it. It's not happening. They will. They will hang on to that thing like, like would the ghee in competition, somebody gets a grip on some part of your di they white knuckle that thing. Especially especially in the lower belts. What he, it's the higher belts too, man. It's every belt because that, gee, that grip can be the difference between winning and losing period. So you, you got to, you got to aggressively avoid that. You've got to be aggressive with your positions. Now in training, again, you let it happen.

Speaker 1:          01:00:59       But here's something that can happen in training. Sometimes you get guys that get used to training and they go into competition. I get overrun. They get overwhelmed and overrun because they thought, man, I'll just, oh, the guy grabs my color, they Jocko grabs my color all every time we roll. Right? And they don't realize that when this guy grabs your color, he's going to attack. And so what you have to do and the other thing is in, in a competition, there's a time limit because there is, there is kind of a, a uh, there's such a thing sort of as a counter puncher in Jujitsu, right? Someone that, and I'm kind of like that, right? Like I don't, I don't usually force a move to happen. Usually I'm going to let you make your own mistakes. I'm going to let my opponent make a bad move and then I'm going to capitalize on it.

Speaker 1:          01:01:46       He uses a lot less work for me. I mean it's, it's, it's a lot less work when your opponent gives you, gives you the submission or gives you the transition or gives you the sweep then trying to make it happen. But again, in competition it doesn't really work because they're not going to give, they're not going to take any risk. They're not going to take any risk and there's probably not going to be any openings. Now again, another piece of this long match. Maybe my, you know, maybe I'm just trying to hire somebody out now in the gym. I have an unlimited time to do that. I can somebody out for 20 minutes, just try to let them pass my guard and they're trying to pass my guard the whole time I'm getting, I'm tired of getting them tired, getting them trying to find the, they expose himself.

Speaker 1:          01:02:27       Boom. I put the choke on. Good. I win. That took 20 minutes. This happens on a daily basis in a competition. I just lost because it was a 10 minute match and the other guy was on top for 10 minutes trying to pass and he got the advantage and he wins. So you can't, that can't be your strategy if there's no time limit. It's the same thing in war, right? In war. You can have a strategy of, I'm just going to where the other personnel, I mean the, the, the Va, uh, Vietnamese data to America, right. They just kind of wore us out. Look at what the Russian strategy of that they used against Napoleon. They used against the Nazis. Oh, you want to come out of school, we're just going to back up a little bit at a time, back up, a little bit of time, backup a little bit time.

Speaker 1:          01:03:08       Here comes the winter in and now you're going to freeze to death and we're going to surround junior and kill you. But that's the same type of strategy. It doesn't work if you, if you have a limited amount of time to win, you have to have, if you, if you have a limited amount of time, which most cases you do, you have to have a default aggressive attitude in. Make things happen the way you want them to happen, not the way your opponent wants to happen, to have them happen, not the way your enemy wants them to happen. And it's the same thing obviously in business and in life, the good things, the good positions, the good details, the good promotions, the rewards, they're not going to come and knock on your door. You got to go out and you got to take them. You got to make them happen on the mat, in business and in life.

Speaker 1:          01:04:07       So get default aggressive. So my recommendation. Yeah, it's weird and Jujitsu is still ambiguous as far as like a like an art and there's like this big spectrum and there's all these exceptions. You know how you see the counter puncher and you did too, where like some guys even like making, you can be a counter puncher in Jujitsu and still be like aggressive bite. So your first move won't be like, okay, if you're going for a sleep, your first move won't be to sweep. You'll go, okay, I'm going to do this other thing. I know his reaction is going to open him up for the sweep. Well for sure, for sure. That's, that's, that's covered move. Actually it's covering move. It's flanking flanking violas. Yeah, because you know I start attacking your neck and you pull your hand up to defend it. Boom. That took your base away. I'm sweeping you. Right, right. Boom. That's, that's what it was. It was a cover move covering my actual attack with my other move. Or you can call it a flank because you think I'm going to come at the front, but then I'm flanking you from the side with the sweep. Yeah. When you put all your chips on the front, you know? Yeah. It's, it's almost like that's like a philosophical

Speaker 2:          01:05:19       question where you can answer it as it applies to something specific. So like for example, like default aggressive in Jujitsu, meaning my default aggressive way of approaching it will give me advantage in this way where I'm going to impose my game or whether that's the counter punching game, whether it's the wear him out for a while game, whether it's, you know, overrunning with my conditioning, whatever that game is, I'm going to aggressively put it on him before he puts it on me. Default. Like right from the time the guy says go or you know, when it goes down the street, whenever, even in training, whatever you're training like that if you want.

Speaker 2:          01:06:00       So that'll keep him in the defensive where he can't get his game going on you, you know, he's defending your game the whole time. Yeah. You definitely, definitely want to impose your will and say that all the time with the UFC fighters. You, the UFC fighter that imposes his well on the other fighters are going to win. Yeah. They're going to win. And it's the same thing with war. You impose your will on the enemy. That's what you do. You impose your will on the enemy and you'll break them. Yeah man. That's why you see guys like in USC, they'll don't front of the middle of the ring, you know, cause they're like controlling during or like a Bj Penn would all be, if he's coaching somebody, he'd be like, be first be first before you put them. So the guy got to defend the whole time.

Speaker 2:          01:06:39       And when you, when you're going against the striker, that ad has that attitude and is being first. Oh it's not fun. They're hitting you and you're not. You're just defending the whole time. Yeah. And it's hard to turn it around. Yeah. Yeah. Then you can tell like when you roll against the guy, and we talked about this before, when you roll against the guy and even if he's not like his game isn't aggressive, but right when you lock up with them, you can tell he's like just in the correct position. You're like, Dang, I can't get like a good like, and when you you're like, okay, I'm going to get in my position. And he just adjust like immediately you're in trouble. Yeah. You're like, Oh Dang. That's in a way, even though that might be like kind of like a passive game sometimes it's like just his game being put on you.

Speaker 2:          01:07:22       Position-Wise in this case is that default decree as opposed to like, you know, like you know sometimes like in training you're training with me and he'd be like, okay, I'm going to, it's essentially letting someone get in an, into a good position on you. So you're training your defense or whatever. That's different. That's like, that's not default aggressive there. You're talking about. I'm really good from the half guard, so I let you get past my full guard to the half guard and now you're in my world. Like something like that. Yeah, that would be, I guess, would that be the default? It's like stilts. Stilts has this weird game because he's tall and lanky and and flexible and so he does things like he'll stick his foot in a place where any normal situation in Jujitsu you'd grab his foot all day long. Yeah. That's what he wants you to do. Yeah. And I was just telling him the other day, I said to all these little things that you want me to do, I'm not doing any of them. Yeah. Pretty Great. And if you

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       just stopped doing them and so we eat, the way he imposes his will is by giving up these bait. He just throws bait out there all day long and he wants you to get you into these positions that he's good at. Yeah. And so you can't take the bait, you can't take the bait. And sometimes the bait is ripe looking. It's like ripe for the harvest. And it's everywhere and it's everywhere. And so you got to just say, no, I'm going to stick to the game plan here. I'm going to impose my will, which is, I'm not going to grab the bait. Yeah, and that's so crazy because like I said, kind of philosophically that is the default aggressive thing when all you're throwing out is absolutely. So instead of imposing my game, I'm like kind of lured by this bait. Even if you know the bait is there, you're on your heels because you're watching out for the track.

Speaker 1:          01:08:55       Well this is just to kind of, I think down in the same vein that you're talking about. I talk about, I talk about safety, like I'll talk to companies about safety, you know, industrial companies or construction companies, manufacturing companies that have, you know, can have people get killed if they're not careful. And so I talk about being aggressive and you know, it's okay, well then Jocko, how does default aggressive going to keep us safe? Because if I've got guys that are out in the construction site being super aggressive all day, guess what? They're going to take risks that they shouldn't. And I said absolutely wrong because guess what you're going to get aggressive with. You're going to aggressively implement your safety procedures. You're going to aggressively like, Hey, you know what? I see a guy walking around the job site without a helmet. We're all over him.

Speaker 1:          01:09:40       Hey, Jack Ass, put your helmet on. Get over here. I'm writing you. I'm to whatever you're going to do. Right, right. Oh, I see a guy without a seatbelt. Hey, you're not allowed to be on the site without a, without a seat belt on. Get over here. You got to, you know, we're docking your pay. You're going to get aggressive in the implementation of your safety procedures and yes, that will make you safer. Yeah. So it's, yeah, I guess, um, when you hear the word aggressive, oh, automatically. I'll give you another example. I'll give you another physical example. Another physical example is, okay, we're in a defensive perimeter. I don't have enough men to move, or I've got wounded guys. I am going to aggressively set security, right? Right. I'm going to put a big machine gun over here. I'm going to get that high ground over there so you can do things aggressively, even though by their nature they might not seem aggressive at first. Yeah. I think that's what you're trying to say. Yeah. Yeah, fully. So it's, it, it, it's almost like it's deeper. It's deeper than just like physically just jumping in. It's more like the, the idea of whatever's going on. Here's another one. I am going to aggressively,

Speaker 3:          01:10:51       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:10:52       ignore. You know, I'm going to aggressively counsel you and mentor you. Now, the worst thing I could do is go echo. You better. Listen to me. That's the worst thing I could do. But to be aggressive in doing that, what am I going to do? I'm going to set really good goals. I'm going to flank you. I'm going to get into your mind. I'm doing, I'm being aggressive, but not an external aggression is an internal question that only I know is happening. You're going to know what's happening in a year when you've all sudden improved and you've been successful and you go, Dang, man. Jack was really helped me out with some stuff. I didn't really realize that was going on, but he did. Yeah. I was aggressively doing it. But you would have never called it aggressive from an external viewpoint. Yeah, so it's as opposed to, let's say like some sort of a laid back approach.

Speaker 1:          01:11:35       Right? Like if, if you have a laid back approach to security, if you have a laid back approach to mentorship or laid back approach to safety. Yes. None of those things are good. That's why we have a default aggressive attitude about things. There you go. We clarified it after it. I Dunno though. One could say that. Back to the question. One could say that having a laid back attitude in Jujitsu, then again on the street, that'd be less likely to have a laid back. Yeah. Did you just in the street, there's exceptions everywhere I would think, but let's see. You know, if it's going down, it's going down default aggressive, but aggressive in the street. Yeah. Right now. Yeah. Once it goes, once it happens. Once the decision has been made, yeah, get after it, it's go time. It's not good to avoid it as long as you can avoid as long as you can, but when you got to go, go hard go. God Dang. I think we're at our last question, my friend.

Speaker 3:          01:12:33       Cool. Jocko,

Speaker 1:          01:12:38       does complacency come with age? I see a lot of guys that back off as they get older. Do you have the urge to back off? Does is a complacency come with age and do I have the urge to back off?

Speaker 3:          01:12:57       Negative. Negative. Back off. Not Happening. I hear that.

Speaker 1:          01:13:07       I'm over 40. I'm pushing 50, whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:13:11       Bring it back off. Negative not happening. In fact, I'm stepping it up.

Speaker 1:          01:13:20       Um, training harder. Eating cleaner.

Speaker 3:          01:13:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:13:26       I'm training more. I'm learning and reading and studying more now than I ever have in my whole life. Do I get dinged up? Of course I do.

Speaker 3:          01:13:39       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:13:39       They're, it takes them some injuries.

Speaker 3:          01:13:41       Yeah. You know what? No factor. No factor. Deal with them. But you do you know what?

Speaker 1:          01:13:54       You know what I hear? I hear the clock ticking. That's what I hear. And the end is nigh and time waits for no man.

Speaker 3:          01:14:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:14:08       And you young guns out there, 18 old, 20 years old, 24 years old. Listen, life goes by and it goes by quick. Don't waste those years. Don't waste them. Live them. Now I know I, I know that you don't think you're going to live to be 30 much less 40 but you are and you will.

Speaker 3:          01:14:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:14:45       In the earlier you get in the game and get on track, the better life you're going to have. Healthier, wealthier, stronger, smarter, better,

Speaker 3:          01:15:00       better.

Speaker 1:          01:15:04       Eight. If you're an old man like me and you haven't gotten on track yet, get on track. Get on it. Now everyone, everyone listening to this,

Speaker 3:          01:15:22       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:15:23       here's the deal. No complacency.

Speaker 3:          01:15:26       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:15:26       no complacency, no backing off, no slack whatsoever. Fight, fight that ticking clock with everything you got. So like the end of a hard day, you can put your head down with ease, satisfied that you've given your best.

Speaker 3:          01:16:02       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:16:05       and I think that's

Speaker 1:          01:16:08       all I've got for tonight. Now Echo, if anyone wants to get in the game as far as this podcast goes, what's the best way for them to do that? Well as far as this podcast goes and as far as they go. Hmm. I don't know if I'd call it help. I'd call it supplemental additions to your life supplements on it.com/jocko you get 10% off for real supplements. Then I said this before, but I think we should say it again. That sometimes when you buy something tells me you're Gunna say, yeah, I'm going to say it again cause I don't, I don't think you're going to talk about chalk. Yeah, I'm good. I'm okay. Cause sometimes I don't know how it is now. I've been out of the supplement game for a while. It's as far as taking protein powders as far as the bad supplements. Yeah. Or just, we'll just say the general

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       mix of supplements, you know, power gainer 5,000 or whatever recovery, uh, you know, x, y, Z, whatever. Sometimes it can just be nonsense in there, but on it, you know, going in, I think we all know that it's the, it's the legit one. The only legit one that I know of for sure. The one that I know guaranteed is legit. Put it that way, that I do anyway. Um, I would recommend Krill oil. 100% Krill oils. Real. Yeah. It's for your joints. I take three 500 milligram Krill oil in the morning at three in the evening. All Dang six. Yes. Dang. Okay. What I do, I take a day. Okay, that's fine. My daughter list them up to the sun and she thinks it's like a red jelly bean. Oh, it doesn't taste like or don't eat it. Don't chew it and swallow. Yes. Little things. Anyway, that's a Krill oil. Uh, though the warrior bars, that's a big deal I think.

Speaker 3:          01:18:18       Oh, is there like a,

Speaker 2:          01:18:22       they're the opposite of a donut in every way except for taste. Yeah. The gluten free too, by the way. Yeah. They teach well. They taste different than a donut, but just as good, if not better, my opinion better. Eight, three of them all at once. I just called it a meal. My meal. Do you stack reading individually? Individually, but anyway. Um, and also shroom tech soap. A lot of people eat, you know how people, they'll say, hey, a lot of people been asking me when, you know, like Bro, a lot of people haven't been asking me, you're just making, like a lot of people are asking. I'm not saying anyone that says that does that, but I'm just saying sometimes you think butter's for real. A lot of people have been asking me is shroom tech real issue in tech row. I hear good things.

Speaker 2:          01:19:06       All this stuff. Okay. Shroom tech, Israel, shroom tech sport. I haven't tried shroom tech immune be, I haven't tried it either. Yeah, because I'm more in the sport mode. Right, right. It usually sport not sick. Oh, oh. But you can just have it because you just want your general immunity to be solid. That's like a good solid thing. Nonetheless. Shroom tech sport is real and I made this analogy again. I think it's worth saying again or before. So again, I think you're going to say it again regardless if we think it's worth it or not. Yes. So let's just so like, okay, this is how it works in Layman's terms. You know when you're driving a car and it's about to read, little needle's going to go into red. You'd like revving at 100 rpm spoon,

Speaker 2:          01:19:53       boom, you're going to be in the green. I'm going to get to the yellow. Even the orange, when you get, when you hit the red, you can't, you can't pull the head. Can't pull ahead if you're in the red, so what the shroom tech does? He take the shroom tech, boom, you're going, you're in the green. You're going to hit the yellow little bit a little bit later than normal. You're going to hit the orange maybe and you, the shroom tech is just going to keep you in the orange, going to keep the needle in the orange, maybe even in the yellow, and you're going to notice that, okay? That's how it works. Anyway, get 10% offers to go on [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko there you go. Boom. Support Yourself. Support your wallet, support the Podcast, you Baja. Good way. Also, if you shop at Amazon, which we all do,

Speaker 3:          01:20:39       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:20:40       Christmas has probably gone at this point, but we still need normal stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:20:47       Duct tape, what

Speaker 2:          01:20:50       pens? Pins, cables, right from your TV or whatever. Anyway, when you, before you shop on Amazon a, you click through our website, which is Jocko, podcast.com on the side there. There's a little Amazon banner. You Click there, boom. Do your shopping. You can support that way. I use the analogy of the little sodium piece that when you throw it in the water, it makes this big explosion situation. That's kind of the, the, the comparison as far as supporting this podcast because when you click through the Amazon banner, it's like such a small thing. It's so easy. It doesn't cost you nothing, but then the support that it brings is like a lot,

Speaker 1:          01:21:30       you know? Yeah. I'm telling you, we're good. We appreciate, yes. Small gesture of, of support to the podcast. The small gesture goes a long way. When you team it up with a bunch of other people, the death of a thousand cuts will kill someone, you know. But the life of a thousand clicks is what we're do just to just the small cliques is echos looking at me like I said something bad. No, no. Good. Oh, it is the life of a thousand clicks. The life of a thousand clicks. Yeah. Click on that thing. Just, yeah. Yep. You're going to get some duct tape might not seem like a big deal, but if a bunch of people, we've got duct tape and they all click through, maybe it turns into a big deal. Yeah. Then we don't have to put advertisements on here. Yeah. Which we don't want to do. Yeah. Or we could, maybe we will. Jack would be reading it. I don't think so. Yeah. I don't think it's happening because we got support from speaking to duck tails. Um, remember the Penn state duct tape? Yeah, sure. Sarah. Two blades. Yeah. Sorry. I need some more tough team.

Speaker 2:          01:22:42       Um, anyway. Yeah. Back to the Ama. Amazon. Yeah. So go to the website, click through the Amazon before you do the shopping. That's a good way to support. Good way. Thank you guys for that. I'm also subscribed to the podcast on iTunes

Speaker 1:          01:22:55       or on Google play or on stitcher. You're on. What's the other ones? Those are the big ones. Yeah. Other stuff. Yeah. What other

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       things you might need? You know, whichever one it's on, man. Um, that seems obvious, but that's a cool way to support. And then the youtube as well. You know, we'll put some excerpts on there. More excerpts. That's the right word, right? Excerpts. Yeah. A little bite size nuggets. Jocko wisdom that if you are inclined to share, you can share and kind of be ensured that there the likelihood of them listening to the whole thing is higher than if you just share that. So the podcast. Yeah. Because if you're like, Hey, uh, you know, here's the, here's the good way to approach college and you want to share this with your friend because they got a son that's going to college or you're sharing it with the frank because they're going to college, they're going to listen to that way more likely then listening to two hours of that episode.

Speaker 2:          01:23:57       There's a long time. Yeah. Cause maybe they're going to college like that day or something. You know what I mean? Or they could just listen to it while they're in college, whichever, but anyway, they're just more consumable we'd say. Yes. Yeah. Bite size, bite size, like a mcnugget Jocko McKnight's. Yep. Exactly. So anyway, the point there is youtube, that's a cool way to, to support and whatnot. Um, anyway, the, and there's a store, Jocko has a store, it's called Jocko store and there's tee shirts and whatnot on there. They're, they're cool shirts, I think. So I don't, I'm not like one of those people where they're like, they're cool tee shirts because that's a subjective thing. So I would encourage, invite people to go to Jocko store.com look at the t shirt. That's it. That's all. That's all. Look at them. If you want to buy one, if you notice the layers, if the layers resonate, I thought you gave up on the layers.

Speaker 2:          01:24:58       Now you're back in the day. We're still doing layers. Yeah, we're still doing it. If they resonate with you and you're compelled to get a shirt, support the podcast. Represent the layers in your part of the world. If you're a cadet at west point, if you're a guy with a truck with a bumper sticker on it, no matter who you are, if you choose to want to represent, do all that, get it. Get a shirt, get a sticker, get a patch, a Hoodie, a Hoodie, get a rash guard. If you're, you know, if you don't have a rash guard and you're doing Jujitsu or cycling or running, crossfit, anything with like a lot of activity, get a rash guard if you haven't already, if you want. Anyway, there is also psychological warfare. We went through really the, the, the what? The beginnings or the [inaudible], not the purpose, what do you call it?

Speaker 2:          01:25:54       The to formation. The formation, the story, the story behind it. Last time. Basically it's Jockos version of those days where you kind of got it. This is my words in my own words. Jockos version of the, you know, those days where you got to talk yourself into doing the workout or not eating, you know, a whole thing of Oreos or whatever. And you got to talk yourself into Oreo. Yeah. Not the whole thing. Yeah. The moments of weakness. Yeah. When you got to talk yourself into it or out of something, you know, like Amen. Hey, do you have to do this? Workout? Doesn't sound like that, but that's essentially, you know what it is anyways. Jockos Virgin, you go on Itunes, you purchase either a track nine, 9 cents or the album like nine bucks, I think. Something like that. I think it's actually nine 99. Yeah. And there's a wake up one you can put on your, um, your alarm clock on your phone to wake you up, clear it with your wife or whoever you sleep with.

Speaker 2:          01:26:57       Go over it, go over the whole plan, like a drill, like Kinda like a fire drill. Really. Because I'm telling you if the few here that even if you forgot that you put it on your phone and you hear that Bro, I'm going to have some explaining to do the feedback has been really good. Yeah. People that have had trouble waking up, they don't have trouble waking up in the morning. You know, people that have trouble when they, when it's snack time, people that have trouble that they can't, they can't say no to the donut. You get it, get this, get the psychological warfare attack going on against the donuts. The psychological warfare will win. Yes. Every single time. Yup. And if you're having a hard time, if you're having a hard time figuring out which day is workout day in rest day, you know when you, you're tricking help configure that out. Yes, exactly right. Exactly right. Yes. That's a good, good point. Rest Day. It isn't today. Yeah. The way if you're in or if you're switching your workout day to the rest day, like if you're doing those, which I used to do, this will help that for sure. All I can all say that right now in public with 100% certainty that at that it'll solve that problem. Sweet. Also Jocko white tea, it is available. It's in stock. It will 100% increase your dead lift by 500%.

Speaker 2:          01:28:29       Uh, no Jocko White Tea, pomegranate, they will make you dead lift a lot more weights. Um, and that is 100% proven in all scientific manners. No, just kidding. It tastes good and it will make you better. You can drink it from a get after it Mug AMUG that will tell you exactly what to do in the morning and that is get after it. And if you like what we talked about on the podcast while you're on Amazon, after you clicked through the Jocko podcast website, then you get there and you can pick up a copy of a book called extreme

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       ownership. You might like it if you liked the podcast. Talk about, talk about leadership and talk about war. Two of my favorite things also, once again, extreme ownership muster zero zero to May 4th and fifth at the Marriott Marquis in New York City. Come to it. You will dig it. The first one we had, people had no idea what we were going to do. They had no idea. We didn't even put up a barely put up an agenda. People came anyways, we delivered, we had an awesome time. The testimonials are cool. So you can know what you took, you can look forward this time Warner, it's not so such a mystery. You can know what you're going to get out of. It echoes making some videos question well is that you're talking about the schedule like this one you'll have like a schedule, we'll have a little bit more, but just people didn't, people just wondered what we were going to be doing there.

Speaker 1:          01:29:59       Right. And you know we, they kind of just took it in faith that we're going to have that they knew one thing that we were going to do there and that was get after it and we did. And so you know we're going to do it again. Like I said, I think I said this last time echoes making videos in once the video has come out and kind of show what's going on, it's gonna sell out it cause the footage from the first one is awesome and it's going to sell out quickly. So get in, get there now and get your tickets now so that you can come. You can hang out with a bunch of leaders, CEO's from mid level managers, vps, the vps, owners, presidents. It's just everybody and everybody that's in the game. Of course Lafe and I are going to be there.

Speaker 3:          01:32:23       Yeah.
