Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number one 75 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. 23 October, 1942 eighth army personal message from the army commander. When I assumed command of the eighth army, I said that the mandate was to destroy Rommel and his army and that it would be done as soon as we are ready. We are ready now. The battle which is about to begin, we'll be one of the decisive battles of history. It will be the turning point of the war. The eyes of the whole world will be on us watching anxiously which way the battle will swing.

Speaker 2:          00:00:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:50       We can give them their answer at once. It will swing our way. We have FirstClass equipment, good tanks, good anti tank guns, plenty of artillery and plenty of ammunition and we are backed up by the finest air striking force in the world. All that is necessary is that each one of us, every officer in man should enter this battle with the determination to see it through, to fight and to kill and finally to win.

Speaker 2:          00:01:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:28       If we all do this, there can be only one result.

Speaker 2:          00:01:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:33       Together we will hit the enemy for six right out of North Africa.

Speaker 2:          00:01:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:40       The sooner we win this battle, which will be the turning point of the war, the sooner we shall all get back home to our families. Therefore, let every officer and man enter the battle with a stout heart and the determination to do his duty as long as he has breath in his body.

Speaker 2:          00:02:01       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:02       And let no man surrender so long as he is on wounded and can fight. Let us all pray that the Lord Mighty in battle will give us victory. B L Montgomery, Lieutenant General Eighth Army, and that is it. Note written on the eve of the battle of Al Ameen, which ended up being the turning point of the war in North Africa.

Speaker 2:          00:02:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:38       In general, Bernard Montgomery, commonly referred to as Monte defeated the Desert Fox Rommel, one of the most respected generals in all of history really. And Monte was a actually a controversial figure and I think he got more controversial, the more famous he got. He fought in world war one.

Speaker 2:          00:03:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:06       He was a soldier. He was gravely wounded by a sniper in the battle of, he prays, he was shot in the lung. He was in such bad shape that they actually dug a grave for him. But somehow he pulled through, he recovered, he served the rest of the war as a staff officer. And he was actually very critical of the, of the tactics and of the strategy and have the willingness of the leadership to accept such horrific and heinous levels of casualties. So he was critical of that. And after the war was over, he served, he stayed in the army, he served in Palestine, he served in India. And then in 1939 of course there was more war and he was in command of the third division. He went to France and he was actually pretty worried about going to France. He didn't feel super confident about it. And he returned home with the rest of the British forces that were driven off the content continent from Dunkirk. And you know, they're, they were able to refit to be able to go out and reengage and he headed to Africa next. And the eighth army was pretty beat down at that point. When he showed up though, he turned around their morale and made them believe that they could win and won the first major land victory of the war in the second battle of El Alamein.

Speaker 1:          00:04:41       From there he helped the invasion of Sicily and Italy and then he commanded all forces, all ground forces on d day. He commanded all the ground forces. So that was obviously a massive operation. He planned and led operation market garden, which was the invasion of low countries. And we've covered some of those battles on this podcast because it was not good. It didn't go well and he was kind of a guy pushing that. But he was able to redeem himself from that during the battle of the bulge, which we've also covered on this podcast. So you know, he had some ups and downs, but mostly ups. So what was the controversy or what's this kind of tainted image of him? First of all, some people saw him as being arrogant

Speaker 1:          00:05:32       and some of the people that saw him as being arrogant. We're Americans, Americans like patent. And Bradley and I mean, let's face it, if you're talking about for sure patent, we're not talking about a guy with a small ego. So you can imagine that when you have a clash of Egos that can be, you know, when you can get some professional jealousy and whatnot. Even Sir Winston Churchill said that Monte was, and this is a good quote in defeat on beatable in victory, unbearable. So there's another, an anecdote about him where he was asked to name three great generals and he said the other two would be Alexander the great and Napoleon meaning he's just on top of the list. So he may have had, it may have been a little bit egotistical and, and, and I think from what I've read about him, he lacked, lacked tact and later on in life he was kind of contract.

Speaker 1:          00:06:32       He was controversial as well. He was very critical of American tactics in Vietnam. He said that America had no clear cut objective in Vietnam, which, you know, I'm critical of the tactics in Vietnam. I think it's pretty safe to say that there should've been more clear cut objective that that obviously made some of our military leadership in America angry. I don't know if I would argue against those statements. He, he oddly enough, spoke positively about the Chinese communist government when he was older. He, he publicly supported apartheid in South Africa. So these are more things that people sort of sort of tainted his image. But besides all that, he is still known as a, as a, as a tactician. And there's plenty of support from his troops and his men that, that loved him and were ready to follow him anywhere. And there's some people that say even that he acted arrogant.

Speaker 1:          00:07:35       It was almost like a show that he put on to kind of unify as troops that this was Monte, this was the great guy. And we're just, we're, we got, look what Monte did, you know, so there's that. He wrote a lot. He spoke, he wrote, well, he's got some great some documents that he put out and I one on one. He's got a ton that you put out. One of them I'm going to read. It's a very, it's a very interesting piece in, and so he wrote this after Germany had surrendered and the British occupation forces were in place in Germany. So you've got the Brits there in Germany occupying the country. You've got the German civilians who had been defeated in war. And here we go to this message that he wrote, 10 June, 1945 Germany, personal message from the commander in chief to the population of the British area in Germany. You have wondered, no doubt why our soldiers do not smile when you wave your hands or say good morning in the streets or play with the children. It is because our soldiers are obeying orders. You do not like it, nor do our soldiers. We are naturally friendly and people, but the orders were necessary. And I will tell you why.

Speaker 1:          00:09:02       In the last war of 1914 which your rulers began, your army was defeated, your generals surrendered, and the peace treaty of Versailles, your rulers admitted that the guilt of beginning the war was Germany's, but the surrender was made in France. The war never came to your country. Your cities were not damaged like the cities of French, France and Belgium, and your armies marched home in good order.

Speaker 2:          00:09:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:35       Then your rulers began to spread the story that your armies were never really defeated and later they denied the war guilt clauses of the peace treaty. They told you that Germany was neither guilty nor defeated, and because the war had not come to your country, many of you believed it and you cheered when your rulers began another war again, after years of waste and slaughter and misery, your armies have been defeated this time. The allies were determined that you should learn your lesson. Not only that you have been defeated, which you must know by now, but that you your nation. We're again guilty of beginning the war for if that is not made clear to you and your children, you may again allow yourselves to be deceived by your rulers and led into another war. During the war, your rulers would not let you know what the world was thinking of you.

Speaker 2:          00:10:43       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:43       Many of you seem to think that when our soldiers arrived, you could be friends with them at once as if nothing much had happened, but too much has happened for that. Our soldiers have seen their comrades shot down their homes and ruins their wives and children hungry. They've seen terrible things in many countries where your rulers took the war.

Speaker 2:          00:11:07       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:11:07       For those things, you will say, you are not responsible. It was your rulers, but they were done by the German nation. Every nation is responsible for its rulers and while they were successful, you cheered and laughed. That is why our soldiers do not smile at you. This, we have ordered this. We have done to save yourselves, to save your children, to save the world from another war. It will not always be so for we are Christian forgiving people and we like to smile and be friendly. Our object is to destroy the evil of the Nazi system. It is too soon to be sure that this has been done. You are to read this to your children. If they are old enough and see that they understand, tell them why it is that the British soldier does not smile. Bl Montgomery Field Marshal commander in chief British area. So obviously that message was produced in German and in English and spread out amongst the population. I thought that was a pretty awesome outlook and he also spoke and wrote a fair amount about leadership

Speaker 1:          00:12:39       and I think when you look at his writing in his speeches, you can see some of his, some of his peculiarities, some of his personality shines through sometimes. And I want to take a look at some of that. Some of the things that he wrote. And the first piece is called military leadership. And it's actually from a speech that he gave at the University of St Andrews 15 November, 1945 it's like a transcript or maybe it's as notes, I'm not sure which, but it's, it's written as if he was reading it. So here we go. Let's go to this book. Military leadership. I've come here to take to talk to you about military leadership. A subject such as this must in normal times seems somewhat remote from this quiet gray walled city by the sea. Today I have to try and equate the definition of military leadership as I see it to the lessons of the past and to the experience of the present. I proposed to limit myself in this talk to higher leadership, the command of armies or a group of armies and not to consider the quality of leadership at lower levels.

Speaker 1:          00:14:02       What I say about higher leadership may well have certain application to leadership of a brigade or a company or a section of men. There are, however, certain differences in leadership at lower levels and I do not propose to take up your time by discussing these today. Now you'll see as he goes into this, he covers these talking about that all the time. I'm not sure even why he, he did that, but he talks about the the the entire chain of command throughout this speech. Military leadership is a subject which has always interested me and during this war I have had some opportunity to put my ideas to the test. I have found that if you aspire to lead soldiers, you must take a close study of human nature for that as the raw material with which a commander has to achieve his end. If you neglect human factor as a leader, you will fail. The personal relationship between the commander and his soldiers is and always has been one of the most potent single factors in making for success in war. If a commander has the complete confidence and trust of his men, there is nothing. He cannot do nothing. If a commander loses the confidence of his men, he cannot succeed.

Speaker 2:          00:15:20       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:21       That's a bold statement right there. That's a bold statement right there and something that I talk about all the time and there's two. There's, there's two words that I use interchangeably. I should, I should use them more interchangeably. More often. I talk about relationships a lot and the word that I should use intermixed with that 50% of the time is trust. Cause to me trusting relationships, it's kind of the same thing. If you don't have trust, you don't have a relationship. Yeah. If you don't have a relationship, then you don't have trust. But they do have different meanings, right? So it's important to me to establish that. And the reason that I bring that up is because if you're in a leadership position and you're breaking the trust that you have with your men, that is going to be a real problem. Yeah. So you could say, well, you don't have a good relationship with them, but you could not have a good relationship with someone and they could still trust you. You could not have a good relationship with someone and you hadn't broken their trust. It's going to be hard if you break your, their trust to have a good relationship with. But the key factor here is trust and confidence of the men.

Speaker 1:          00:16:31       Back to the book. Now, let us consider on what a man's power to lead others is based is necessary first to define what is meant by leadership. And this is where this gets a little interesting. I suggest to you as the definition of the word leadership, the will to dominate together with the character, which, which inspires confidence. The measure of a man's ability to lead, I think is twofold. So the first part of the definition of leadership and his mind is the will to dominate. Hmm. Which is we're just, we just stuck and you're going to see where he kind of counters that and he talks about, he talks about decentralized command. He talks about everything that that I believe in. But you know, I don't talk about, hey, as a leader, it's first and foremost that you have to will to dominate other humans.

Speaker 1:          00:17:17       Right? That's not, in fact, I think that's a kind of a negative quality. But that being said, if you have someone that doesn't mind not winning, not dominating, well then guess what? They're not going to put forth any effort. They're not going to make things happen like force of will. I talk about that all the time. You, you, you have to import. You have to have the force of will to make things happen. Sometimes you just have to make things happen. They're not going to happen by themselves. Anything that's anything that's going to come that's good in life. It's not going to happen by itself is just not going to wake up and it's there. Like, like an Easter egg that's not happening. Oh No. You've got to go out and you gotta make it happen. Yeah. Okay. Maybe you get an Easter egg when you're six years old lawyer. Once you're 26 years old, there's no Easter eggs coming to you. You got to make them okay. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:12       Back to the book. First, it lies in his will to dominate the men and events which surround him, the will to drive himself and his men to the limit of their powers for a specific purpose and the refusal to allow anything to divert him from his aim again, you're going to see where that sounds so strong. It sounds unbalanced, right? It sounds, it sounds like he's outside the dichotomy of leadership. He's going too far in one direction is being extreme like nothing. You're going to refuse to allow anything to divert you. Oh, okay. So does that mean that mean you get everyone killed? That's what they did in World War One and he didn't like that. But you're going to see where he balances out these statements later. Second, it lies in the strength of his character, whether good or evil, to inspire others to place their complete trust and confidence in him and his ability to lead them with success and to infuse his men for the task in hand. This ability of a man to inspire confidence in others and to create enthusiasm is a spiritual quality, but it is not, but it is well to remember that this quality need not necessarily be for good. The evil leader has equally the ability to inspire confidence in others and in history. The evil leader has often at any rate temporarily prevailed

Speaker 1:          00:19:30       and he counters that at the end too. There have been many with different, with different types of characters, character who have inspired men to follow them. I proposed to choose three great captains of the past and examine briefly why these men were leaders and how they lead their men and how as leaders that they succeeded or fails. So he's going to go into a little case study, a couple of pages here. I will first consider Moses. He was already old when he was called to lead the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt. His task was an immense one. He had first to inspire his people to cast off the yoke of the Egyptians. This was no easy matter. Israel had been living for about 400 years as slaves of the Egyptians. They had lived in the Nile delta, a bad climate and one which tends to SAP up energy and initiative, but they lived where food was plenteous.

Speaker 1:          00:20:27       While all around were deserts, which could barely support life. Moses must've had to overcome the most tremendous initial inertia to persuade Israel to launch out into those deserts with all the risks of famine, disease and the necessity to fight his power to inspire and dominate his fellow men must have been of a very high. Now see, that's where I dis, I don't look at that as domination of your fellow man. You're, I look, I see the inspiring part, but I'm not looking at it. Hey, we are looking to dominate. I see his angle, right? I see. I see what he's, I see where he's coming from, but, and maybe that word, you know, words change words, Murph morph over time. Maybe that word dominate that he's using. Maybe. Maybe it had less of a sting to it then you know, 50 years ago possibly hadn't a listing.

Speaker 1:          00:21:20       70 years of words change words change over time, but that's what he's saying. But things were kind of hardcore to right back then. You know how like long time ago they're just things in general. We're a little bit more blunt. Yeah. So maybe the Times, Moses, I'm sure they were pretty blunt and even this time. Yeah. I don't know though. I'm not, I'm not 100% sure. I'm not 100% sure if he means the word dominate the way we think of it, the way I think of it, apparently not. I mean it seems like there's a little bit more to it, I guess. Well when he counted and you'll hear him counter. I guess that's what maybe makes me think, maybe he means it a little bit less severe maybe because he starts to talk about the, the balance of this dichotomy, because let's face it, hey, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:11       Let me ask you this question here. This one is gonna make it real easy. If I was a type of person that was like a, I'm looking to dominate you, come with me into the desert where we're going to have to live with, as we're going away from the Nile River and we're going out to this barren area where there's not a lot of food and I'm going to have a domineering personality and I'm gonna be all over you every day. How enticing is that? Not Very. Not Very. Now, if I was inspiring and I said, listen, Echo, we're going to get out there. We're going to train, we're going to come back. We're gonna get our revenge. It's going to take some time, but we're gonna make it. You're like that. That's different, right? Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. You know what? Now that I'm thinking about it would dominate like what's the root word of dominant?

Speaker 1:          00:22:51       You know what it could be. Yeah. I should have studied the etymology before we got on this podcast. I apologize. You know what? It could be though. Picture, when you have a good leader that dominates the room, right? Right, right. Yeah. That's a positive thing, right? So this guy just get you. Oh yeah. You know, Echo came in for the meeting. He just dominated the world. He did great. Right? That's a positive thing. So maybe he means it that way. Unfortunately, he talks about dominating the wail of, right? He talks about dominating the men and events that surround him. I don't know. Actually. It doesn't talk about dominating the will, so maybe that's what they mean. Maybe he means just like this dominating presence. All right. Going back to the book without a doubt. Moses realized that when he led Israel out of Egypt, they were useless as a fighting people. They had been slaves for some 400 years. He therefore set to work to train them for the task and to forge the weapon which would conquer Canaan. It's interesting, he talks about the training of armies as forging weapons, like you're forging this weapon. I think that's a pretty cool analogy. I believe that Moses intentionally kept Israel for 40 years in the desert for two generations in order to breed and train a fighting race capable of undertaking the task of conquest which lay at hand.

Speaker 1:          00:24:09       And in that 40 years he taught them gradually how to fight and conquer. He took meticulous care over there training and it is most interesting to note his refusal ever to risk any failures into action. This is interesting and he brings us up quite a bit. So Moses, Moses didn't take any risk of where he was, thought he might fail. We read of him soon after leaving Egypt, asking if he might lead Israel through the country of another people on being refused permission. He marches round by another way, but later when the same situation arises, when Israel is better trained to fight, he leads his people straight through the middle of that country and destroys his enemy utterly. He was a good judge of what Israel was capable of doing and what Israel was not capable of doing. And as a result, he had an unbroken record of military successes. He had the wisdom and the insight into human nature to realize that the best way for a leader to gain confidence of his soldiers is to give them victories. If a commander gives his soldiers victories, they will follow him anywhere.

Speaker 1:          00:25:18       But Moses was not permitted to see the few fruits of his own work. He sinned by claiming as his own powers, which did not belong to him. And for this sin of presumption, he was forced to hand over to Joshua the final conquest of Canaan for which he had so well trained the children of Israel. So there he wraps up on on Moses, eh? I think that, and he kind of refers back to this point later in the, in this book is the fact that you got to be, you know, you gotta, you gotta push for victory, right? You got to push for victory and this is, it's almost like risk aversion, right? Which I'm not a fan of and you can't be risk averse, but you got to be calculated back to the book. And then the next section he is going to talk about chrome. Well he just refers to him as Carl Unwell. Oliver Cromwell, Cromwell who wasn't an English statesmen but he was a soldier. This is like in the 1600 1620s he was a hardcore puritan

Speaker 1:          00:26:28       and he organized military forces in the, when the civil war broke out, 1642 he was the deputy commander of the new model army. He defeated the main royalist in 1645 and then he commanded campaigns in Ireland and Scotland and the 1650s he was, he was kind of a over the top, I guess you might say in some ways he eat, I mean beyond that he, he mass and him, there was an Irish massacre, you know, and that spiraled into a war for hundreds of years. And, and ultimately as a politician, once he kind of got done with a war part, he became a politician. He end, he really didn't do a great job. So that's just some kind of highlights of Oliver Cromwell. But here we go back to the book I next proposed to consider Cromwells another leader who went to wage war only when he was over middle age.

Speaker 1:          00:27:34       He was over 40 when the civil war broke out. He started the civil war in command of a troop of 60 men and then commanded of that troop. He fought at edge hill there in spite of the parliamentary superiority and men and guns and a free fervently held cause he saw the failure of his own side disease, the victory. And s and he saw them escape defeat only because of the folly of their opponents. This gave him much cause for thought superiority in men and equipment was clearly valueless unless something further was added. This is a part that I kind of got fired up for what was needed also. So besides guns, good superiority in magnet superiority equipment. What was needed also was the leader who would forge the weapon out of the enthusiastic material available and would then lead it with vigor and determination determination to achieve his military.

Speaker 1:          00:28:32       And so once again, we're talking about what leader can take this glut leader can forge a weapon from men he saw to the nature of the weapon required and how it could be forged. So he started to understand the the men as a weapon and how you could forge this weapon properly. And he set himself to task to the task of building a force after his own principles based on a high fighting spirit spirit, good discipline, and a sound knowledge of tactics. It was to be a force which would of have complete confidence in him as their commander. So this guy saw this situation where they almost got crushed. The parliamentary forces were so disorganized that they couldn't even take advantage of it and he saw, okay, this is my opportunity and those are great lessons. I love it when you learned the lesson that you didn't really have to pay for.

Speaker 1:          00:29:29       It happens sometimes. It happens in MMA sometimes where you guy wins a fight because something you get lucky in the end and you get to know we've got the w, but we also got to learn a great, a great lesson that happened in combat all the time. You come back off an operation and you're like, man, if we would have gotten hit at this particular moment, we had security was down. We were not paying attention. We didn't have this Flint covered. And by the grace of God, we didn't get contacted from that area. But we can't let that happen again. So sometimes you learn a lesson even though you didn't have to pay for it. And that's what it sounds like happened here. The back of the book, he said about his task full. We are told of a furious zeal, a fire in his belly which compelled to him which compelled to others to follow him.

Speaker 1:          00:30:09       He had complete confidence in his ability to gain success in war. He saw the way in which he had to train his men to fight and the few essential oils which would ensure success provided his men had the right fighting spirit. Edge Hill was fought in October, 1642 with chrome, well as a captain of a troupe of horse 60 strong. By January, 1644 he was a lieutenant general second in command of Manchester's army of the eastern counties, the leading cavalry commander on the parliamentary side and the one outstanding commander in the parliamentary army. So he made a rapid transition. Now he gets into this. Cromwell was not a likable man. He was quick tempered, believed in rigid discipline and constant training and he drove his men hard, but he believed with a blinding certainty in the righteousness of his cause. He enthused his soldiers with its righteousness and he was convinced of his own ability to succeed, to achieve success in battle.

Speaker 1:          00:31:17       This is one of those things where you know, when you hear that people that Monte was a little bit like lack of tact, is one of those things where I think, well, did he read this? You know, did he read about chrome will and study crumble and say, well look, no one likes chrome. Well, that's okay. You can still be a good leader. You don't have to be liked. In fact, Lafe we'll tell the story. There was a guy that was, was Leif was teaching a class, two young seals, and there was a seal officer that would come in and say, you shouldn't be liked if you're in charge and laughs. You know, we'd sit in the back of the room and think to himself, this is not good, because that's not true. It's not true. Now, it's probably true that what the guy was trying to say is, listen, you're not always going to be popular for you to, your goal should not be to be like, which I agree with, but to say, look, you're going to be hated by your troops.

Speaker 1:          00:32:13       That's just the way it is. That's wrong. If you're hated by your troops, you're probably doing something wrong. Yeah. And to say that if you're essentially the what the guy that leaves talking about, if he's saying, if you're liked by your troops, you're doing something wrong, kind of living. Yeah, that's true too. What it feels like. So, so I understand that thought as well. Like, Hey, everyone loves me. I must be doing a good job. It's like, no, actually, if everyone just thinks you're their buddy, that's a problem. So that this, this may have been what this officer was trying to teach to the, uh, to the young officers that that life was in charge of instructing. Yeah. I'm sure he tried to, was trying to say the right thing. Yeah. But perhaps he wasn't articulating it. Yeah. 100% in the most clear way with a guy cause just to sell, hey, you're not going to be liked where you're an officer.

Speaker 1:          00:33:03       Not True, not true and not good. If I have, if I look at a seal platoon and the seal platoon doesn't like their officer, that's not a positive sign. That does not mean that guy's a good leader. Now it's also not a good sign. If all the soup tune, everyone loves him. That doesn't mean it's good, good platoon either. Yeah. So you can be loved, but you're not doing a good job. You can be hated and you can beat a good job, but you're probably not gonna be able to pull off doing a good job when guys don't like you. They're not going to put forth any real effort to yeah. To make you look good is basically what they're doing. Yeah. Yeah. And at the end of the day, it obviously seems like it's just not that cut and dry like that, you know? No. Back to the book. And he did achieve success. He had no failures. And if a commander has a righteous cause and gives his soldiers success, he will gain the complete confidence of his men. And then there is nothing he can not do, but the power.

Speaker 3:          00:34:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:01       Which his prowess in the field had one for him, led chrom well to seize the reins of government for himself, he became impatient with the inefficiency methods. Inefficiency of the parliamentary government of those days and he compared it unfavorably with his own ability as a soldier to give immediate decision and to see it take shape at once. Inaction. So you took over the government and he wanted things to move real quick, but unfortunately, but as in battle, he had been sure of the correct course of action. So in the political field, he was on many occasions, uncertain and perplexed during the period in which he ruled England, he tried out five different systems of government and all failed. And at the end he was governing alone and much more absolutely than ever. Charles had attempted to rule internally. He tax the people more highly, any disregarded parliament, more brazenly than Charles never done. And he interfered with the personal liberty. More Toronto stay in Ireland. Also, his harsh and cruel policy left a lasting hatred, which the centuries have not quenched, but his rule was not wholly unproductive. He made the fighting starts. So he did accomplish one thing. He made the fighting services the finest in the world and he gained for England a voice in the affairs of Europe such as England, had never had before, so he was not a good governmental leader.

Speaker 3:          00:35:33       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:35:34       many of his triumphs abroad were transient in ups and unsubstantial and much that he attempted at home disappeared when he died, but he's worked for the navy and it's initial steps toward the creation of an empire, planted a foundation from which much has grown, so he had a good impact on the military, but as governmental governmental leading abilities aren't all that strong.

Speaker 1:          00:36:03       The third great captain I suppose to I proposed to consider is Napoleon a leader driven by selfish and evil ambition. It's interesting and not like the other two in pursuit of a great ideal, unlike the other two, he was a soldier by profession, trained from his youth and the profession of arms. Even as a very young boy in a military academy, he was clearly a leader. He wished to dominate and he did dominate his fellow men. There it is. That one sounds a little stronger. That's all. A little bit more like what I think of dominate. Again, unlike the other two, he rose at a very early age to a high and independent command. At the age of 26 he took command of the army of Italy and army inferior numbers and equipment to its opponents and semi muteness from lat lack of pay, yet within a year with this inferior weapon which he reforged to his liking, he fought brilliantly, brilliantly successful campaign in the northern Italy and imposed piece on his enemy.

Speaker 1:          00:37:05       I liked that imposed piece on his enemies. From the moment of his arrival with his army. He dominated his troops, both generals and soldiers and inspired them with confidence in his ability to give them success of that ability. He himself had never any doubt and in his own self confidence lay much of his power to inspire confidence in others behind this dominating self confidence. However, les napoleons ability to see in any military problem the few essential oils on which success would depend. He had the great power to simplify any problem and to see what details were important and which were unimportant. There you go. That's prioritize and execute. And it's simple both in one big rule, right? You got to know what's important. You got to prioritize the importance things and you've got to keep everything simple. I got a, I got an email from Sarah Armstrong. Sure. Talking about podcasts, one 74 trying to be a five. Oh. [inaudible] trying to be a five. Oh, in all categories. And she basically emailed me and said, hey, heads up. I used to try and be a five Oh, in every category. Even in categories that didn't matter. So that's, you know, give heads up. And I was like, well,

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       yeah, I mean I've talked about, I've talked about that. I talk about it with clients all the time, but I talk about on the podcast as well when they've specifically, I talked about it saying, I don't know if you remember this example. I said a black belt in Jujitsu. Like they don't care where you're grabbing their sleeve and you're getting all crazy. They don't care. That doesn't matter if you're a white belt, someone grabs your sleeves, you're freaking out. I mean if you're, if you're a black belt, like okay, if you're a good leader and there's some, some, some issue that guys are complaining about snow factor, you don't care. And then there's some issues that come up and you go, okay, that's important. I need to address that. So this is what he had the ability to do is figure out what is essential and what is not.

Speaker 4:          00:39:16       Yeah. Yeah. And that's, that can be kind of a tricky one. Cause you know, some, some things are super small, super small, but at the end of the day that might be kind of important. Yes. You know like you can sort of predict, you're like, hey, that's small. Sure. For sure. Hey, I could see that continuing and growing, you know, for sure. And sometimes all you have to do is monitor it to make sure it doesn't grow. Yeah. Sometimes you have to put it in check for sure. Sometimes you have to destroy something, remove it, Jill. It sometimes you can't worry about it because it's not important. So you've got to figure which one of those out. Like if your employee, say you're a boss, your employee comes in one minute late, let's say comes in on time every single time like, but right out he cast to get there at six you get there at six on the dot every single day.

Speaker 4:          00:40:05       And then like one week on Monday comes in at six oh one is that a big problem? One day? No, it's not a problem. You, you might want to throw a little something right. It's something little something. It's not nothing. Yeah, there's a little something. That's what you know, you might even want to say something like along this I was private. I'd say see what happens when you cut it so close every day. You're already a little, your missed it by a minute bro. Exactly right. That's it. You just throw a little, a little yeah, just let them know you're watching. Yeah. Just like how you said like some things there. Kini but am I going get, am I going to give a due to written counseling cause there were women at late. No. Cause now the guy's looking for different jobs and work cause he doesn't want to work for you.

Speaker 4:          00:40:45       Spazz out on him. But at the same time he's at six oh one he's like cool. So the next day he comes in at six o'clock we'll say next day. Then the next Monday comes in at six oh two oh two no, it's just one more minute. All right, got to put it in check. Yes sir. You just a little something. Same like some things they seem small but you can take a broader view and be like, hey this is kind of important. Yeah. This is, it goes back to the troop shaving in the Soviet troops stopping shaving. This is it. This is the slippery slope of a lack of discipline slip. Yeah. But I can tell you this, if you're focused only on these little things, you might miss the big picture, which was Sarah's point. Yes. And I responded, I said Hey, I totally agreed with her, talked about some of the black belt thing and then the boss thing. And then I was like, and by the way, cause this is something I've talked about, the floor in my garage gym is not to clean.

Speaker 4:          00:41:47       It does. It gets a 2.0 on cleanliness. Five out of five maybe even gets a one. I think one may have maybe get some [inaudible] not bad. However, however it gets like a 1.5 because it's not, it's, it's not. It doesn't have actual dirt on it. It's just God speaking. It's just got a chalk and sweat stains, dried up utility button, you and I said it would take 20 minutes to a half an hour each day to keep that thing at a 5.0 inspection ready level because once you got to get in there and space basically got a power wash, that thing daily, that's where you're at. So I'm not power washing that thing daily. Why don't, why is it, why is it not clean? Not Important. Do I, I have, I actually have a vacuum in my garage that I hit it with. Sometimes I hit it every two, three days.

Speaker 4:          00:42:42       That's a lot different than breaking out then. Then pulling the mats out, power washing them in the alley, and then bringing them back in. That's a, that's not even half an hour. That's like a, that's a serious evolution, you know, that's a serious evolution. So is it worth being a 5.0 in Matt cleanliness garage gym? The answer is no. The answer is no. It's not worth it. You need to lower that on the priority scale. Now do I have big chunks of dirt and dog hair piled up and debris? No, it's completely debris free, but there are some sweat stains on it. It has been there. The remnants of getting after it. Right, which is kind of conducive Kenzie way. It is the way it is to the standard. Then generally speaking, not just an application to your garage, gym floor to like everything. It's like little things.

Speaker 4:          00:43:39       I mean just the basic little little framework to establish depends on the thing. Yeah. So but what is it? So you can go, let's say you go fundamentally then, so what is it like if it, if it gets in the way, even if this much, this little millimeter gets in the way of the overall objective, then it's relevant. Important. Well, no. Then we just have to frame it so that we're not, when we frame it as a waste of time, like how much effort are you going to put into that is no, if it's not, if it doesn't get in the way, if it, no, no. If it gets in the way, then I'm putting too much time. If, if it gets in the way of my strategic goal, it's to bump into too much time into, okay. If solving this particular problem to know it. Yes, yes. Okay. Okay. But a amend the existing of a small little problem. If it's, if it's get gets in the way, so like gets in the way, then it's a problem. Yeah. Like I'm

Speaker 1:          00:44:31       like the guy coming in late. Right. And let's see, all my garage floor, there was chunks of rocks underneath the mats and they made it uneven. Yeah. And it was like slightly hazardous for me to be moving around on it and it interrupted and my weight's rolled around. That'd be a problem. Yes. It's effecting my strategic goal. Yes. Those mats are getting picked up. The rocks are getting moved. The floors getting leveled in. Then we're good to go. Yeah. On the, on this levelness my maths get a five o perfectly flat. They're good to go there. Do not interfere at all, but they got some getting after it. Stains on them. Yep. There it is.

Speaker 1:          00:45:19       Okay. Going back to the book, having grasp the essentials of the problem and having inspired his soldiers with confidence in himself and with high morale. He knew he could not fail. Napoleon, however, was always as much a politician as a soldier. He had a great love of intriguing, of diplomatic bargaining and his contempt for his fellow men and his passion to dominate them and events led him to aspire to greater things. From the time he became first council political rather than military factors influenced his decisions and his failure to reconcile his political aspirations with what was militarily possible. Finally led him to the disasters of Moscow and the peninsula from which no recovery was possible. He started playing that political game, started making his military decisions based on what he wanted to happen politically. Now, what did these three men, Moses, Cromwell, and Napoleon have in common without which they would have not achieved success?

Speaker 1:          00:46:29       The most outstanding similarity was that they dominated their fellow men. They were all supremely confident that they could and would do what they set out to do. It was quite simple to them, quite easy, and success was absolutely certain. This certainty gave them each the power to inspire others to follow blindly and to the limit of their strength and this inspiration and power to enthuse others in measurably increase the power of their forces to achieve whatever was asked to them. That's called the confidence right there and that's what that is. Pure confidence, isn't it? Isn't it interesting when you see someone that's ultra confident and no, they're not even overflowing into ego, but they're just really, really confident and, and Pete people fall, people will, will be like, okay, I'm on board this, this, this person's in the game. They believe it. I'm Balombo. I believe it too.

Speaker 1:          00:47:28       You know, I've seen situations where people are so confident that people are following them even though they're wrong. Hmm. You know, you get, you would get that occasionally with a, with a seal platoon, you get some experience guy that was super confident and he will actually wasn't that good or didn't really understand tactics too well and need to knows what we're doing. Yeah. You know, so I've done this a million times. It's all, by the way, that's a red flag when somebody, when somebody counts on their number of times or their experience that the way we've always done it, I've done this a million times. That's a red flag. The reason that they're using those statements is because they don't have an actual answer. So one of the new guys says, Hey, hey boss. I'm not really sure why we, why are we assaulting, you know, through the target from this area over here.

Speaker 1:          00:48:11       Wouldn't it make more sense to do? And he goes, Oh look, I've done this a million times zero, we're doing it. He just thinks your cell phone so you don't have an actual answer. You don't have an answer as to why. You're just, you're just throwing that out there as the easiest thing for you to do. So if you ever find yourself saying, because this is how we've always done it, or look, I've been doing this for 28 years, you don't have a good answer. You're all that could work against you to be honest with you. Hey, I've been doing this for 28 years and then like that day and the person figures out like a way better way to do it. He'd be like, Dang Bro, you've been wasting your time for 28 years. Yeah, it could definitely work out bad. It could work out bad because you're not listening to anyone else.

Speaker 1:          00:48:50       You're not taking input. And then you end up making a bad decision from what did these men get their supreme confidence in their ability to achieve their purpose in battle. I think they got it from their ability to see their problem in its simplest form. Amen. I totally agree with that. To see the few essential is necessary to the successful solution to the problem, and to see how those few essentials could be achieved. This is why I'm always talking about qualities of leadership. The ability to simplify. I'm sure you've heard me say this a thousand times. If you have the ability to simplify things, that's a great asset to have and not everyone has it or not everyone has the same level of it. Some people are good at it, some people not so much. Some people just straight up complicate things. Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49:40       Once they grasp the essentials of the problem, they never lost sight of them and never allowed a massive detail to submerge what was essential to success. Boom. Don't get caught up in the little details of things that don't let those things drown out what the real situation is for all military problems are in essence simple. But the ability to simplify and to select out of the massive detail, those things and only those things that are important is not always so easy. So got to keep things simple. Each of these men had the power to dominate other men spirits to inspire their enthusiasm and to convince them of their own ability to achieve what was asked of them.

Speaker 1:          00:50:30       This moving of men spirits, this power to enthuse could only be done and was only done by their personal contact with their men. All my three examples weren't close and frequent contact with their troops. They were well known, familiarly known to them and took frequent opportunities of talking to their men. So again, this is where that the thing I, I spoke of earlier where it's like he kinda, he kinda comes back on a, you got to be this dominating person that he's talking about. You got to get out there and talk to your troops. You gotta be really truly personally known to them. Napoleon and Kronwall certainly in very possibly Moses too, were known to their men by nicknames and use this familiarity to help their purpose. At the same time, each of these leaders knew, well, what the soldier was thinking and what he wanted most. And they made always careful study of the human factor. Now it's interesting because,

Speaker 5:          00:51:26       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:51:27       no Monte, he's known as Monte. Everybody called him Monte. Yeah. And that's his nickname. Yeah. And that little breeds a little familiarity. Yeah. And like I stole naming a unit, renaming a unit when you took it over. I stole that from David Hackworth. Yeah. I wonder if Krom I wonder if Monty stall this nickname idea and kind of gave himself that nickname. Right? Hackworth took it from Monte. Well, no Hackworth. Well actually I guess Hackworth, everyone just called hack, hack. Hey, everyone called me Jocko. Yeah. Like everyone, it's funny, someone said, everyone in the chain of command, the people below me in the chain of command call me Jocko and the people above me, the chain of command call me Jack. Ever call me Jocko. Yeah. So that was Kinda cool, but that was just like coincidence. I don't even know why.

Speaker 5:          00:52:11       Yeah. But

Speaker 1:          00:52:15       Hackworth, he didn't really, I don't think Hackworth gave himself a nickname. Yeah. And let's face it, the Hackworth other than Hackworth and as, as General Mooka Yama told us he had the best nickname of all time, Mr Infantry. That is the coolest nickname ever. He's hack considered a nickname if it's short for your, I think it is. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. There are certain names that have an official shortening of it. You know, like Richard and Rick or you know Jonathan and John. Robert and Bob. Bob. Yes, exactly. Bill and William and bill on that. Okay, so quit hack is not an official unofficial, so it's sorta it, it goes into the realm of actual nickname, not just shortening of the name. Yeah. Yeah. But I think I, we can research this all, it's not coming to me off the top of my head, but I'm pretty sure everyone called hack. Hack. Yeah. Like up and down the chain of command. Yeah. Although his soldiers back in the day probably called him, sir. That's more normal for Vietnam. Dang. How do you engineer it? Nickname no. For Yourself. You can't do that. You can't give your nickname to yourself. No. But you can actually, there has to be a way to sort of engineer the environment.

Speaker 4:          00:53:25       You could say, Hey, I'm hack. How's it going? Yeah. But the isn't that, I mean if the, it would have to be established before that. If you just start, like if I just start saying, Hey, I'm dragon. No worries. You, if you checked into a military unit or you and no one knew you and you're like, Hey, what's up? Um, um, dragging boy. Yeah, that would be no, that wouldn't work. No, but if you said, hey, my name is, you know, frag mob or whatever, if you just made up, you know your nickname, all guys calling me that. Yeah. I wouldn't, one time I hooked a grenade and it rolled back and you know, those places would have games. Not true though. You know, like doesn't mean problem. If look, if you hook the grenade in a thing and someone called you fragment from then, then on, then boom, someone gave you that nickname, but you can hook a grenade.

Speaker 4:          00:54:08       It does whatever it is that it doesn't be like I should be called. You know, he can't really do that. No nickname herself. No. So even if you introduce yourself, if no one knows you introduced yourself. Okay, I'm dragging boy, but I just gave that name to myself today and, but, and they sure they'll call you dragging boy. But if one person finds out, oh, you just gave yourself, then they're going to get your different nurse. Oh yeah. Oh, you're somebody else. Yes sir. Real. So how do you do it though? You don't. You just gotta let it. That's what I think is important. What's important here is that the familiarity isn't a lie. The familiarity is real. Yes. That's the difference. You know how you do it. It's not just, it's not 100% you, it's more allowing nicknames to BC. You know how like you know some people, their name, I don't know for just for example, hypothetical example, like let's say it's like, Hey, my name is Jonathan, and then you know, in a casual conversation with, Hey John, what's up done.

Speaker 4:          00:55:03       And then there'll be like, hey, it's like no disrespect or nothing, but it's Jonathan. Like they preferred the whole thing maybe to pull John's more of an official one. But like if Hackworth would've said, hey, it's, it's Hackworth not hack, then he probably wouldn't have had the name hack. That's true. So when someone busts out a nickname for you, you just got to let it fly. Well, I'll tell you in the teams when they bust out a nickname for you, if you protested, it's going to stick even. There you go. So you could essentially in theory, fake protests. Exactly right. They'd see right through that call that fine Jag ass, you've got to be quick. You've got to be sneaky with it, I guess. All right. Okay. Back to the book. If a leader neglects the human factor, he will fail. No Man can lead others if he does not know what they are thinking and feeling. So again, we got Monty here who kind of talks like he's all aloof and everything, but he knows you got to know your people and you've got to understand people. And then he goes on a little shift here. No leader, however great can, can, can long continue unless he wins. Victories without victories in battle, all else is useless to what then is success in battle

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       do is great. Study of Marlboro. Mr Winston Churchill says, very truly, and so here's a little quote from Winston Churchill, and this is interesting. He's talking about the Duke of Marlborough who was, uh, another guy in the 16 hundreds that fought in the war of Spanish succession. This guy never lost a battle apparently. And, and interesting, he was the Duke of Marlborough, but his actual name was John Churchill. And he is actually, I want to say the great, great, maybe great grandfather of Winston Churchill. So this is Winston Churchill's bloodline. Sure. And this is what Winston Churchill says about his great, great, however many great grandfathers. And I think that's right. The success of a commander does not arise from following rules or models. It doesn't come from following rules or models. It consist in an absolutely new comprehension of the dominant facts of the situation at a time and all the forces at work, every great operation of war is unique. What is wanted is a profound appreciation of the actual event. There is no sure road to disaster then to imitate, imitate the plans of bygone heroes and to fit them to novel situations. So there you go. This ability to co two absolutely comprehend this new situation and to not try and force, not try and force a rule or a model to to work for you in a certain situation.

Speaker 1:          00:58:04       Back to the book. This indeed is true for no war foreign war. No two situations are ever the same and each situation must be tackled as a wholly new problem to which there will likely be a wholly new answer. You need only to look at the beginning of this war and to and to the trust put in ImageNow line here in deed. Was there a failure to appreciate the new and change technique which had risen and one which rendered such fortifications in themselves wholly useless to win victories. Certain qualities are necessary and I will mention for which were possessed in greater or less by all the great captains of history. These are the knowledge of the technique of making war. So that's interesting because Churchill just said, look, it's not using this previous knowledge. You gotta be able to apply it. But at the same time, guess what? You got to have the knowledge of the technique of making war next to the ability to see clearly the few essentials that are important to success. Next, courage and mental robustness. And lastly, a well balanced judgment.

Speaker 3:          00:59:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:19       He kind of goes through these in a bit more detail now. The manner in which war is waged varies from age to age. And with the advent of each new weapon, it is a constantly changing, constantly evolving thing. He who aspires to high command in war must thoroughly understand the main principles which will dictate the manner in which the battle of the of his age will be fought. He also must be constantly on the watch for new ideas or weapons, which will affect those principles. The speed of change in military science during time of pieces, often slow and many of consequently allowed themselves to be lulled into false sense of security, which has been rudely shattered on the outbreak of war. So guess what? You got to have an open mind and you got to pay attention. The knowledge of how to make war also implies the ability to train troops. Every great commander has himself had to forge his weapon for the task in front of him. Moses led the people of Israel for 40 years in the desert, teaching them how to fight and he forged the weapon to conquer Canaan. So also chrom, well and Napoleon, they forged their own weapon for this specific task in hand, improvising and inventing as they went along so as to develop new tactics to deal with the new problems with which in their day they were faced.

Speaker 1:          01:00:45       So you've got to study war, you've got to understand how to train your troops. Continuing on. No Man can be a great military leader unless he has the ability to cut through overlying difficulties and to see clearly the few essential in any problem which with which he is faced in any problem. There are never more than a few essentials which are vital to that problem.

Speaker 3:          01:01:11       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:01:12       that's a pretty bold statement and it's also pretty true. Yeah. You get these big problems. Guess what? There's only a few things that are truly essential. Now, as you solve the first couple essential ones, there's going to be the next essential problem. This is prioritize and execute. Yeah, and it's kind of simple to read. Simple. Yes, like they're both wrapped together in this thought. These must be grasp out of the massive details and must never be lost sight of. If in battle commander loses sight of the few essentials that matter, he will suffer defeat. So when you're getting distracted by these other things, you're going to end up losing. But to see the essentials, clearly he must not himself get too immersed in detail. Every great commanders had a chief of staff who's main task with the mastery of detail, thus leaving his master free to tackle essentials of the problem together with those details and only though those details which were vital, that problem, boom, that's it. You cannot get in the weeds. You cannot micromanage. You cannot look at a plan all day and expect that you're gonna see something that your troops didn't see who are doing the planning. You need to step back. You need to elevate yourself

Speaker 1:          01:02:24       for though they're as much detail in which the for though is there is much detail with which a commander cannot and must not bothered himself, is interesting to note that every great commander has always concerned himself with certain of the details of his problems. Napoleon and Wellington are two good cases in point. No Man can rise to a high command who is not the quality of courage. The highest form of personal courage is required rather in the leader at the lower level who has to plunge into the turmoil of the battlefield. So yeah, if you're in the frontline troops, you need even more courage. The leader at the higher levels has to develop his quality of courage into a mental robustness, which can withstand the mental stress and strain with which he will be assailed.

Speaker 2:          01:03:16       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:03:16       He must at all times. He must be able at all times to take a dispassionate view of the good and bad fortune, which will a sale him. Ah, read that one again. He must be able at all times to take a dispassionate view of the good and bad fortune, which will a sale. So a get bad things are gonna happen. Good things are gonna happen. Don't get all excited when some you get all excited, you gotta be dispassionate. You got to detach. You can't let your emotions start getting crazy. You have to detach. He must not allow himself to be distracted by events or to be led astray from his main purpose. By some glittering prize. He must at all times maintain an unbiased view of the situation and in battle, he must be able to judge the true value of the mass of good and bad tidings, which will flow upon him.

Speaker 2:          01:04:13       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:04:14       man. Stayed attached. Stay levelheaded, go too bad. Does that kind of like one, like, you know how you get the, the husband or the boyfriend or whatever that like, you know, he does something bad. I Dunno. Flirts with a girl or something like that girl, that girlfriends all mad. And then so the guy goes and bias or like, oh, necklace, you know to say sorry. It's Kinda like that, right. Where don't get all caught up in the glittery stuff because you know, no, that's not what this is like. This echoes saving up to buy a house. Yeah. In any saving up. And he's like, okay, I saved, you know, 800 bucks last month. I'm a save 1200 bucks this month. I'm gonna save 900 bucks this month. And all of a sudden you see a, a new car with rims in, in with has rim and you can get it, you can lease it. Uh, yeah. And all you need to lease it is, you know, $4,000 and you're like, you know what, I'm going to go get data as the shiny

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       new thing. They just took you off of your main goal. Yes. That has nothing to do with flirting. Girlfriend buy a necklace as well. I think yours is a better example. For sure. I big so here's wasn't even an example if you missed the point. Okay. Yeah. Uh, I'm trying to think of where it would be. Oh yeah. I mean, so if we're going to talk like a girl that was saving for a house. Yeah. And then she's all cool necklace, that would have been a good example. Yeah. Look, the flirting girl with the distraction from the boyfriend. No, that's, that's, here's how I would try to connect the dots on that one. But you know, the girl, her mission is to evaluate whether or not this is the good boyfriend straight up and then saw the boyfriend. He does some stuff that's fundamentally bad cheats on her, I dunno, whatever. And then, you know, so she's sort of on that mission. She's sort of making the evaluation. Then boom, she gets distracted by the sparkly necklace. Boom. She goes back to them, blah, blah, blah. See what I'm saying? It's still, oh no, not quite. Not Quite. I mean, I good, good effort, good effort.

Speaker 1:          01:06:18       Moving on. Every battle resolves itself into a tussle between the wills of the two opposing commanders. Unless he's mentally Robusto, commander will not be able to force his will on his opponent. It is well for a commander to remember that no battle was ever lost until the commander thought it's so

Speaker 6:          01:06:38       hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:06:41       No battle is ever lost until the commander fought it. So a commander must have a well balanced judgment. They're too little balance of the dichotomies here, both from the battle situation and in his dealings with his subordinates. This is straight up dichotomy of leadership. He must be okay now. He must see the battle situation as constantly shifting interplay of forces, and he must instinctively know when to be rash and when to be cautious. Boom. Gotta be balanced. He must weigh up the situation both at the moment and as it may develop in the future. And he must so fight his battle that the enemy's reactions cannot upset his plan. And Novo, he's trying to force his will on his opponent. A commander must know when discretion is the better part of valor. His desire to dominate his opponent must not outweigh his judgment of the actual possibilities of the situation.

Speaker 1:          01:07:43       Yes, you got to be aggressive, but you can't be foolhardy. That's what we're saying here. This is the dichotomy of leadership. His judgment and must always be well balanced and if it is so, and if he has good information on which to base it, he can so forced the battle his way, that the enemy will be forced to conform. He will in fact have rested the initiative from the enemy in his dealings with his subordinates. He will also require good jet judgment and sound knowledge of human nature. He must choose subordinates well those with whom he is infrequent contact, his senior generals must know personally. He must know personally and well. He must be able to judge when to drive and when to persuade, when to be stern and when to give praise for all men are different and each requires handling it a different way.

Speaker 1:          01:08:36       So right there he just talked about the dichotomy. Leadership, right when to drive and winter persuade when to be stern when it be give praise God a balance. Those dichotomies. The three leaders whom I have concerned, considered succeeded so long as they kept in their mind. They're clear military purpose and we're not deflected from it by any other considerations, but there is always the danger that other and especially political considerations will be forced, will force the hand of the soldier and leading to some action, which is militarily unwise. Many battles have been fought for political and not for military reasons, and these have been the graveyard of many a soldier's reputation. The soldier is the servant of the statesmen and is therefore bound to be subject to political pressure. He must be strong enough to resist such pressure whenever it conflicts with his clear military purpose.

Speaker 1:          01:09:33       Few statesmen will force the hand of the soldier. If the soldier very bluntly says, okay, five, fight as you wish me to fight, I shall lose the battle. If I fight in my own way and in my own time, I shall win the battle. So there you go. That's what you gotta do. You gotta call it like you see it, but the soldier, it must be prepared to be very blunt and he must be prepared to stake his whole reputation on successive given adequate resources and a free hand. And he also must be prepared to be very firm and to refuse to be forced to do something which he considers is not capable of being done. So there you have it. If you don't think something can be done, it's your moral obligation to say no. And of course you have to weigh that with the fact that if you don't do it, someone mouth's might and they might cause even more damage. So you have to weigh that. That conundrum back to the book in history, the military leader is frequently been tempted and as frequently succumb to the temptation to aspire to political leadership.

Speaker 1:          01:10:43       The whole training and experience of the soldier makes him less rather than more fitted to be a politician. So this is, this is an interesting contrast. The soldier is trained to take direct action down certain well defined blinds and as in his hand, a military machine which responds immediately and with precision to his touch. The politician is trained in subtlety, in debate, in weighing up the conflicting interests of his supporters and usually has to compromise the governmental machine much less precise and exact than the military and is not as rapid an action even in highly skilled political hands.

Speaker 2:          01:11:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:11:22       Now in worf commander compromises on essentials he fails.

Speaker 1:          01:11:28       Furthermore, the time factor forces the commander in the field to adopt the best expedient in the time available, which is usually short. The politician on the other hand is seldom forced to give an immediate decision. Rather he delays in order to find out the right to an accurate answer and he avoids any temporary expedient one seizes time by the forelock and adopts the best expedient, the other procrastinates in order to ensure that what he does is exactly right. Now I think you could. I think this gets taken to the extreme in both cases cause you actually, even as a military leader, you want to weigh in, make sure you're, you want to, you want to wait long enough to make sure you're making a good decision. And I think in the political world they go to the extreme of they're just going to never make a decision, never going to make a change. Therefore, leader who is primarily a soldier, when he metals with politics, it loses his clear and simple military purpose. He no longer sees the essentials. He is at sea in a political world. We read that chrom well in politics was muddled and perplexed working slowly in deviously to a policy which he did not clearly see

Speaker 1:          01:12:42       and again that he was confused and distracted. So though he kept the political power and his own hands during his lifetime, much of what he built fell to pieces. The moment he died. So Awesome Napoleon, as long as his military purpose was upper, most in his mind he succeeded. But when had political considerations dominated as policy, the desire to impose his will on Europe led him to undertake military operations, which it was beyond his power to achieve

Speaker 1:          01:13:10       the qualities required by a soldier and by a politician are in fact almost at opposite poles and only a few men in history of possessed both kinds of qualities. There have not been many soldiers who have made good politik politicians nor many politicians who have made great soldiers. Now, the only thing I'll say is that being in the military is very political and you've even in this time I, I'm not gonna make any distinction that, oh, it's more political now. It's not the old moon may old books about World War II was all kinds of politics, politics, politics going on inside the chain of command. So Adam, I'm not sure why he, I'm not sure why he, he sees that great distinction between, you know, there being no, like there's no political things, no political games being played in the military. There certainly is. Certainly is. And there always has been. And there always will be. It's a group of people and then group people are going to do the little political maneuvers. I, we'll look out for themselves. They're going to try and make this happen. You know, that's, that's they're going to have an agenda. You got to learn how to negotiate those politics, whether you're in the military and whether you're in the civilian sector. It doesn't matter

Speaker 1:          01:14:25       before we leave the past. It is I think, interesting to note that great military leaders have on the whole been few.

Speaker 3:          01:14:33       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:14:33       there've been many generals of good average ability but few who were really great in the study of those who are great. It is interesting to note two things. First, a required a war to produce them. Second, that a number of them prove their greatness after a very short apprenticeship. This suggests that the art of war, at any rate in the past though less so now is a relatively simple art and that the qualities which make a great commander, our inherent rather than acquired, interesting. He's a little bit more saying, hey, you kind of born with it. The character and more especially the will to dominate and lead. His fellow man is given to few, but given that power to lead, the ability to gain success in war can be acquired so you can get better at it. A man may cultivate the qualities of a great leader provided that he has inherited him in sufficient degree, the character and the will to dominate. But unless he has those inherent characteristics, he will never become a great leader. However long he studies the art or the craft of war.

Speaker 3:          01:15:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:15:47       Here's one of the phenomena of military history that events in variably produce the man age has little or nothing to do with it. The opportunity may come sooner to som later to others. Napoleon was 27 when he conquered northern Italy. Wolf was 34 when he captured a Quebec at the younger end. At the other end of the scale of Marlborough was 52 when he first rose to high and independent command, an Abercrombie conducted as short but brilliant campaign in Egypt at the age of 68 at the end of a long lifetime in the careers of great generals. There's always been this aspect of chance. Opportunity comes at different ages and in different circumstances. Some have been luckier than others. Some perhaps never had the opportunity to prove their ability.

Speaker 3:          01:16:33       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:16:33       so that's where he wraps up so much for the lessons of history today. The problems of military leadership are much the same as they always have been. I proposed to tell you now some of the things that have guided me in leading armies, which had been entrusted to my command, I would say first that a leader must very clearly know what he wants himself. He must see his objective clearly and must go all out for it.

Speaker 3:          01:17:00       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:17:01       He must let everyone else know what he wants and what are the basic fundamentals of his policy. He must in fact give from guidance and a clear lead. It will be necessary for him to create what I call atmosphere and in that atmosphere, his subordinate commanders and troops will live and work to do this. He will have to take a very firm grip on his military machine from the top. Only in this way will his force acquire balance and cohesion. And so develop its full fighting. Potential history has many examples of a lack of grip being taken by a commander with the result that he failed to develop. The power of which is forced with Cape was capable and so met disasters we've done. This is Monte. You got to take that from grip and again it's very strange because he comes off so strong like that, but here we go. He's going to counter it right here. Having laid down the basic fundamentals of his policy, a commander must complete, must place complete trust in his subordinates and less give them freedom to carry out that policy within the framework which he is laid down. So this is decentralized command. He must be prepared to decentralize and to trust his subordinates to use their own initiative on all matters of detail. Everyone listen to that.

Speaker 1:          01:18:25       Don't worry about the details. The commander of selfless stand back from the detail so we can see clearly the essentials of his problem and make sure that the correct action is being taken on those essentials. If ever a commander allows himself to become too greatly immersed in the unimportant details of any problem, he will fail to see the essential clearly detached stake. A step back, elevate yourself. It is obvious that he must be a good judge of men and a good chooser of subordinates. He must also have the drive to get things done. No commander will long remain in the first rank unless he achieves success. The biggest single factor for making success in war is morale. High Morale is based on discipline, self respect, and the confidence of the soldier in his commanders and his weapons. It is a pearl,

Speaker 1:          01:19:20       a very great price, and without it, no success in battle will be achieved. A high morale is in fact a measure of the confidence of troops of their commander. That's an interesting point, right? How do you have high morale? It's a measurement of how confident the troops are. Hmm. So when the, when, when the troops are confident or the or the employees are confident in the boss, morale is high. When they're not confident, morale is low. And by the way, with low morale, you're not winning. Continuing on. There is no book of rules which will help a commander to gain the complete trust and confidence of his men. Each commander will adopt his own methods and say the ones best to his own personality. Suffice it to say that he must be known, must be known personally to them and that success in battle, we'll produce quick results. All soldiers will follow. A successful general no commander, however, will gain the confidence of his troops unless he is known and well known to them. They must often see him and if possible, hear him speak. A commander should take every opportunity of talking to his officers and men. It will repay him according to his worth. Got To get out there and talk to the troops.

Speaker 1:          01:20:44       There are other factors also, which have a big effect on morale. The home front and the battle on the front nowadays are as as never before, very closely linked. So you've got to got to keep that morale up. You gotta make sure everything's going good on the home front and see. Imagine what it's linked like now. I mean, this is what he's talking about. World War Two, World War II. Hey, we're very closely linked because I can write a letter that's going to get to my wife nine weeks from now. Right now we got brothers on Facebook live nightly, continue on just to success as a great stimulus to morale, so nothing lowers morale. So quickly is failure. Therefore there must be no failures. Great and lasting harm can be done to morale by undertaking operations for which the troops concerned are not ready or or trained in which they are likely to end in failure.

Speaker 1:          01:21:43       I have therefore made it a rule to limit the scope of any operation to what can be achieved successfully. So again, this sounds super risk averse and that's, that's that is, hey, I'm not going to do anything that I don't know we can achieve it. Then again, how often do you want to be rolling the dice? W W why not say, you know what? Well let's give it another month. Let's train a little bit more. What do we have to do this right now? You know, and I certainly think that there's times when you have to take risk and you're going to do some things that maybe you don't know if you can get away with. And there can be times where you're forced into that position as well. Like you're being attacked and hey, we can, I'm not sure if a flank is going to work, but we can either sit here and get attacked and get flanked by them. Or we can go and flank ourselves like, let's, let's go make this happen. So I think we need to make sure we don't take that route, that comment to the extreme because that can be a bit much, but consider it, consider it deeply.

Speaker 1:          01:22:46       And I think probably the reason why this, this is probably one of those points where, you know, he said in the beginning of this, he made the premise that, um, that hey, this is, uh, this is, this is for army command, right? Or at least divisional command we're talking to, you're in charge of 10,000 people or so. What he's saying maybe, but I guess it becomes more acceptable of a rule. You don't want to risk 10,000 you don't want to risk an entire army or to entire division on something that you may or may not be successful at, right? Maybe we need to reassess if we're not sure we can make this happen. Maybe we need to reassess if we're going to go forward or not.

Speaker 3:          01:23:25       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:23:29       Another thing that today has a big effect on morale is the standard of medical care which soldiers can expect. So you got that

Speaker 1:          01:23:42       and then we get to a commander must make a very close study of human nature. The raw material with which he has to deal are men, and it is important to remember that all men are different. What a commander makes of the human material at his disposal will depend entirely on himself. I have found that every division, which has fought under my command, has added different characteristics. Each division was good at a different type of battle, and it is a vital that the commanders should gauge what type of battle is best at and make sure that each division is at the right point when required.

Speaker 3:          01:24:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:24:25       So even in the quote, uniformity of the military, the half differences, they're human beings and those, those differences are reflected through whole units. The difference between divisions is based partly on the individual individuality of the commander of the division and partly on the type of men of whom the division is composed. I found for instance, that some divisions were outstandingly good at the breakthrough attack, but we're not so good at the deliberate set piece affair. Some divisions we're best at night, some by day four, a solid killing match. Certain types of men were better than others and so on. Each division develops an individuality of its own, which I consider a high commander

Speaker 3:          01:25:09       must study.

Speaker 1:          01:25:12       I was in the airport and I ran into a dude from South Africa who is in the game kind of big time, and he was talking about, he says, yes, I can't do it on their accident, but he was saying that he had, he worked construction, he was a construction guy and he had a crew and he gave his crew a name. I should have asked him what the name of the crew was, but I didn't. But I'm sure they gave him, he gave him some kind of name and he was like, he was just so pumped. And he goes, yeah, I read it in Hackworth too. And then I, I did it cause you did it. And he goes, it really worked mate. It was all fired up. Could you can change the personality of something. You can change the personality of a unit like that can do it. It works.

Speaker 3:          01:26:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:26:09       In the same way, all generals differ and must be selected for the job in hand. No two jobs, no two problems are ever the same. And the character of the job must be matched to that of the commander selected to undertake it. One of the most important functions of a commander in war does to make sure that he has the right man in the right place to tackle the job in hand. So think about that. When you're in charge of a team, when you're in charge of a business, one of the most important things that you do is put the right people in the right job. Some people are sensitive to that, you know? So when I'm like, Hey, hey bill, I'm not giving you this op, I'm giving it to echo in. Bill gets mad and frustrated and he's the things to echo doesn't deserve it. Man. We got to have a good enough relationship and trust that when I say, Hey, bill, this ops not for you, I'm giving it to echo. And he goes, okay, cool. Let me know what's coming down the pike. Let me know what I can get ready for it. Let me know how I can support.

Speaker 4:          01:27:06       Yeah, yeah, that. Remember you remember the movie Major League Charlie Sheen? Come on. But yeah, I remember the movie. I don't think I ever sat through that whole movie. Oh actually, you know what? I think I asked you that before. I think you said the same thing. So there's this part where case Charlie Sheen, right? He got his glasses. He, Oh yeah, that's what we were talking about last time. So last time as far as major league goes, the movie major league. So Charlie Sheen, he had all this crazy power and speed in his fastball, but no control, no control. Then they find out whatever, he can't see that good. They give him some glasses. Boomi, he brings it all together. They start waiting on this stuff, right. So He's starting the other guy who was starting before him, his name's Harris, older guy, but you know the basically the more concern, like he's consistent. He's not like legit like Charlie Sheen, but he's consistent, you know. So there are about to play the fast forward, there are about to play the gang keys, right. And the big or the is that called the world series?

Speaker 4:          01:28:03       It's like this big deal. And you know, so the general manager, Lou Calls Charlie Sheen, what was his name in the movie? Charlie Sheen doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Anyway, it calls Charlie Sheen to the back of the bus and he's like, Hey, I'm going to start Harris against the Yankees. He just has a better reputation against them and you know, more, more experience or whatever. And then Charlie Sheen was like, oh yeah, you know, whatever's best for the team. And he left and that was sort of it. So he was good with it. Now the movie goes on and he's not good with it. He expressed himself like he was good with it and he said the right things, but later on it goes on like goats drinking by himself or something. And then he winds up hooking up with like one of his teammates life. And that was all, but that's a whole nother story though. We don't get along. We don't actually care about any of this, but definitely old grandma. That part [inaudible] that's his name. Wild thing. Rick One. They go. Same deal though, right? You got to get the right guys and of course nailed it. You

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       nailed it. You even silly. Uh, Harris, you know he does. Okay. You know, and then they bring out Rick Vaughn to fit the clothes out the game or whatever and you win. So there you go. Boom. All right. Wayne went back to the book back through the book. If a commander thinks that all men are the same and he treats the mass of human material accordingly, he will fail.

Speaker 2:          01:29:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:29:27       The soldiers of today have different standards and require more enlightened handling. This then the soldiers of bygone days. This is again where he starts to, you realize that this guy, even though he tries to come across all hard, he's actually very thoughtful about understanding humans back to the book. They will no longer follow blindly and unquestionably to an unknown end today. Therefore, a commander must ensure that his troops always know what they are being asked to do and how that fits in with the larger plan.

Speaker 2:          01:30:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:30:05       I have always been, in other words, they got to know why they're doing what they're doing. I have always insisted that before a battle, the essentials of the plant are known right through the chain of command and finally down to the rank and file. The troops must know how a commander is going to fight the battle and what part they are going to play in it. This must be explained to them by word of mouth for that counselor. Far More than the written word.

Speaker 2:          01:30:26       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:30:27       and then when the battle has been won and the troops see that the battle has gone, as the commander said it would, their confidence in the high command will be very great. This confidence is beyond price.

Speaker 2:          01:30:39       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:30:40       The problem with that statement is it puts pressure on you to stick to a plan. Did you get a flight that, that make you think, oh, I'm just going to stick with it because I want everyone to think that it went the way I want. I wanted it to go, no, don't just stick with a plan. If it's not working, it's not working. Shift a commander must watch carefully his own morale.

Speaker 2:          01:31:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:31:03       A battle is a contest between the will of two opposing commanders. The one who's heart fails. When the issue hangs in, the balance will lose the battle.

Speaker 2:          01:31:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:31:13       A commander, in fact, must throughout radiate confidence in his plan and operations, even though inwardly he may not be too sure of the outcome. That's the one of those other things, you know, people talk about transparency, right? Transparency. Oh, guess what? And it's like, oh yeah, there's a book. There's all kinds of book about transparency. Yeah. Like go, you got to be fully transparent with everyone. No, actually, sometimes if I'm a little more nervous about what we're doing and I started to show that everyone's going to be nervous about what we're doing. Yeah, man. And had seen, yeah, they can up. And sometimes too where like, like how you mentioned before, like some people can't take the truth, you know, like, so like

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       if there's certain shifts going to be made or certain like rules going to be implemented or whatever, you know, like, hey, we're, we're going to move, we're going to demote this, or we're going to move this person out of this department because he's just, he, he's ear, he stinks. Or something. Like he has boo and he's irritating everybody, you know, kind of thing. Okay. And he'll be, he'll just do just as good at work down here in the basement where he's by himself. Exactly. Right. You know, and it's like, hey, hey, we're going to shift you over here. And he's gonna be like, oh, cool. Like why though? Like I'm done to do it. But why? DB transparent? Maybe, maybe not, but you run the good thing.

Speaker 1:          01:32:42       It would be like, hey man. Hey Bro, let me ask you something. If I had a booger hanging out my nose, would you want, would you would if you had a booger hanging out of your nose, what'd you want me to tell you? Everyone says, yeah, of course. Cool. You stink. That's good. Yeah. What about Stinky gies on the mat, right. Somebody's got to let them know, bro, you gotta wash that thing. You might need a new geek. You know some people, they have this old ratty geat. The smell is embedded in those things. I had keys like that was like, you wash it and then you wash it and you take it out. You put it on for four minutes and you go, Oh yeah, I've got to throw this thing away. This thing stinks, Huh? Yeah. That's true. That that would be a better way to do it. That you can't say, hey, why don't you move to the beginner class?

Speaker 4:          01:33:33       Go drill over there. Go work with the grappling dummy over there. It's like,

Speaker 1:          01:33:38       oh, that's not cool. You need to tell a brother, hey man, you stinking. You need a wash. Your Geek washed Yogi immediately. Yeah, so this is, this is one of those things where if you, if you need to talk to them, right? Even in that situation, you do need to tell the truth. You know, you do new. Say, hey listen man, I don't know what's up with your hygiene needs some work. All right, so what if the company is taking this massive financial hit and layoffs are coming straight up. You lay off one guy, he left two guys. Do you be transparent? Like, hey guys, we're taking a massive hit. We're laying off a bunch of people. Well, yeah, not in that case. You have to say, hey listen, this is what's going on and this is where we're at and we're going to do our best and the best way we can do this is by buckling down hard and working hard.

Speaker 1:          01:34:30       But right now it's going to be tight going. It's going to go through a tight quarter right now we had to let go to guys. We're going to try and maintain what we got, but I can't promise you anything, right? You gotta be yes, yes, I'm going to be truthful. So maybe it is better to be transparent. Most of the time it is. Most of the time it is what we do. Well it's in this situation, what we're talking about is if you lack confidence in what you're doing and you start to reveal that to yeah, got you, then that's not good. And you know there's, there's time. Now let's say, let's say Echo. Let's say I didn't think you were cognitively capable of doing a job at the next level. I might not necessarily tell you that because that's something that you can't necessarily change.

Speaker 1:          01:35:21       You can't go home, take a shower and get smarter. Right? It doesn't, it doesn't work that way. You can't put on deodorant and now you're smarter. That doesn't work. Be smelling bad is not a, is not necessarily a bad problem cause it's something that can be fixed. But if you, if you aren't smart enough, well then we have a, we have a situation you can't really, I mean you can study, you can work but you're not going to get smarter. Right. So it might not be a great idea for me to say, well you know I I decided not to. You know, you're not getting promoted promoted Billy. Cause you're, you're dumb. Yeah he's just a hot tomorrow. Here's the deal man. Just straight up. You're not that smart. Right. Sure. So I couldn't put you in charge of anything cause cause you're not smart.

Speaker 1:          01:36:03       Now that's different than me saying, hey listen man, six months ago if I was like, hey listen man, you need to start paying attention because what you're doing right now, if you're going to move up, you got to really know you get, it's going to take you some extra study. And look I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed and I, I know I have to work hard at making this stuff happen. Do you look at your, do you look at your manuals at all? Have you been studying your manual? So you need to like dig into your manuals and really know this stuff. If you're think you're going to get promoted, you're not going to get promoted. And unless you know this stuff like the back of your hand, you need to get in the game. So if we've already been through the whole thing and you actually got out the manuals and you tried and you didn't make anything happen while you guys what, hey man, there's just not that many opportunities at this next one.

Speaker 1:          01:36:45       And by the way, I think there's another kind of course of career course that I have thinking for you. You know, so let's talk about that. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, definitely some that, some that requires large biceps I think is going to be your area of expertise. Thanks. Check going back to the book in order that he may keep clear of unimportant details and thus have time for the quiet thought and reflection of higher commander must work through a chief of staff and thus avoid having to deal separately with the heads of all branches. So far as I'm aware of the British army is the only army which was, which does not adopt the chief of staff system. In my own experience, it is quite possible to, is quite impossible to exercise high command successfully in war without it. I've adopted the chief of staff system myself throughout this war and could not have succeeded otherwise.

Speaker 1:          01:37:45       So you've got to have someone that's going to handle things for you. A little things you know, I was talking about the um, the senior enlisted guy in a platoon chief or an a task unit or in a platoon or a company, an army company. The senior enlisted guy I always said was the action arm of the commander. So when you need something done, I don't have time to go do it myself. And if I go do it myself when I've lost the bigger picture, but if I have something critical, you've got the senior enlisted individual that has the most tactical experience, has the most, uh, 40 the most respects. When you say, Hey, chief, that building over there hasn't been cleared yet. I don't know what's going on. Go clear that thing. And he'll say, Roger that or the platoon sergeant or the company first sergeant.

Speaker 1:          01:38:31       Those guys should have the experience and the technical expertise and then be utilized as the action arm that can make things happen. Now that's not exactly what a chief of staff of is. It's actually quite different, but it's similar in the fact that you can't get sucked into the weeds. And if you, if you're the commander of a, of a division and you're in the weeds all the time, you don't have, you can't see what's happening. And it's the same thing in a business. If the, if the CEO of the business is running the business daily, he's not looking up and out. He's looking down and in and that's not going to allow him to make foresee what's coming down the pipe in the future. And that's pretty much what it says here. No officer whose daily life is spent at the consideration of details or who has not.

Speaker 1:          01:39:12       Time for quiet thought and reflection can make a sound plan of battle or conduct large scale operations. The wise commander is the one who uses a chief of staff who sees it very few papers or letters himself and who sees that the majority of reports that are made to him, our verbal and short, only in this way, giving himself plenty of time for quiet font reflection. Will he be, will he keep himself mentally fresh and capable of producing the sound plan of operations which will defeat his enemy for the plan of operations must always be made by the commander and he must not be. I must not be forced upon him by his staff. Bias, bias, circumstances or by the enemy. That's pretty important. Why are you allowing the circumstances or the enemy to dictate how you're going to do things? That's not a good call.

Speaker 1:          01:40:04       A commander must decide how he will fight the battle before it begins. He must decide how he will use the military effort at his disposal to force the battle to swing the way he wishes it to go. To be able to do this, his dispositions must be so balanced that he can ignore enemy reactions and continue with his own plan until he is certain of success. He has got to strive to read the mind of his opponent to anticipate heavy enemy reactions to his own moves and to take quick steps to prevent any enemy interference with his own plan. Again, this is a little bit sketchy to me cause now we're talking about, hey, I'm just driving forward with my plan no matter what. I don't like that attitude. I want to be flexible. I'm going to try and stick to my plan, but I'm going to be flexible.

Speaker 1:          01:40:49       This, this is one where you know, man, I don't even know this is, this is one of those things where sometimes I would get guys that would there be a little change. They come up with a plan. They'd spent all this time planning for a mission and there'd be little change. Maybe they getting ready to go out. Some imagery comes in and it shows something little bit different. Or maybe they get some Intel. It's a little bit different and they decide they're going to, they've already planned. They've already rehearsed, they already know what they're doing. Everyone's kind of walked through and they decide they're going to change their whole plan because of some little thing. And I would say, man, don't change your whole plan. I get you want to make a little adjustment. Do you want to take a little fire team and have them make an adjustment to take a squad, make them do something that's, that's okay.

Speaker 1:          01:41:31       Don't, don't try and rearrange your whole plan. You've already rehearsed. You have to unrehearsed. You know how hard that is if the unprogrammed your team, that is really hard to do. So sometimes, and I used to, this is actually one of those things that slowly I don't really talk about very often because, but I used to used to be in the the combat leadership brief I used to give, it used to say don't fall for 6% advantage over the enemy. And what I meant by that was, and I used to draw a target up on the, on the dry erase board and I'd say, okay, you're going to take down this target. So you come up with a plan, how do you only want to do it? And I was just, we set up an l and basic maneuver, okay, cool, you're getting ready to go out and do this.

Speaker 1:          01:42:18       And you find out that there was an outhouse over the berm over here and there's a chance two o'clock in the morning that the guy could be in that outhouse. What do you want to do? And some guys would completely change their whole plan, completely changed their whole plan. Meanwhile, we're launching in two minutes or eight minutes or 20 minutes. They've planned this, they've rehearsed it. Everyone knows what their job was. The whole team came up with a plan together. I mean it's like a, it's really in their brains and now they see this little detail because there's a chance that at three o'clock in the morning when you hit this target that the, the guy that you're looking for is in the outhouse, so we're going to change our whole plan to make up for this tiny percentage chance that this guy's even in the outhouse.

Speaker 1:          01:43:00       Not a good call. Can you break off a fire team that's going to maneuver to a position where they can at least keep an eye on that on house? That's fine, but don't change your whole damn plan based on this little 6% chance that the enemy might do something you didn't expect or know the enemy. That's something is very unlikely of happening. It's not that you didn't expect it, things that you don't expect. That's why you have contingency plans which is like, hey, when we fly in, if we see any other outbuildings that we missed on the imagery, we have a fire team designated to go and get eyes on those things from the high ground. Oh, okay. Cool. That's a contingency plan that works.

Speaker 1:          01:43:36       Going back to the commander here, he has gone always to be a very clear thinker and must aim to be always one move ahead of his opponent. I actually prefer it to be about five booths to do this. He must simplify the, whenever a problem arises he must think out the few points which will form the framework of the solution. The few things that will really matter so long as the solution to the problem is based on those few things that really matter. The solution will be on the right lines, solid, solid. You have like this, just this pathway and as long in the path at the end of the pathway is what you want to achieve. As long as you're doing things that are on the pathway, you're going, you're getting there. When you start doing things that are off the pathway, we've got a problem.

Speaker 1:          01:44:27       Sometimes you've got to look at your, your subordinates and say, hey, it's not even on the path in the direction that we're heading because it doesn't seem like a domain. A commander must at all times. Exercise, personal command. That is to say he must give, must see and give full verbal orders or instructions to his subordinate generals on how the battle is to be fought. Operational Command in the field must be direct and personal. No written order can ever be the equivalent of a direct verbal command. Interesting. And I've, my standard is, I do both. I do both. I say, Hey, echo, here's what we're doing. Hey, do you understand this? Do you have any questions? Cool. And I send you a message that says, Hey, echo, this is what we talked about. This is what you're doing and making sure you understand if I can, I'm going to do both. If you want to do one. Yes, verbal is better. Most of the time a commander must therefore understand how to give verbal orders to his subordinates. No two generals are the same. Each require different treatment. Each will react differently. By exercising personal commander commander can exert a far greater and more exact influenced on the battle and the confidence which will grow up between the commander and his generals will be of great value. The whole chain of command can VUSs and only thus be built into a United team whose strength is based on mutual confidence and understanding.

Speaker 2:          01:45:56       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:45:57       relationships. That's all relationships is what he's talking about right there. When the whole army is built into one great team United in working all out for a common purpose, the result is terrific. Success in war is due to good teamwork by all members of the fighting forces and to the correct use, which is made of all members by the team of the team, by the commander and his staff. But failure in war is always due to one of two causes.

Speaker 2:          01:46:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:46:30       To faulty command or to bad staff work and sometimes do both.

Speaker 2:          01:46:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:46:37       I can think of no instance where the failure has been due to a failure of the fighting man. The British fighting man will always do. What is asked of him, but you must make sure

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       that he understands what he is asked to do and also that it is within his capacity to do it. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:47:01       If your team is not doing what it is you want them to do, the first person you should check is yourself. If you're giving people complex orders that they don't understand, there's no possible way they can execute those plans. And here's how he closes this out. Finally, I do not believe that today a commander can inspire great armies or single units or even individual men and lead them to achieve great victories unless he has a proper sense of religious truth.

Speaker 3:          01:47:29       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:47:30       and he must be prepared to acknowledge it and to lead his troops in the light of that truth. He must always keep his finger on the spiritual pulse of his army and he must be very sure that the spiritual purpose which inspires them is right and true and it's clearly expounded to one and all. Unless he does this, he can expect no lasting success. So what you got to believe in, what you're doing.

Speaker 3:          01:48:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:48:07       For all leadership, I believe, is based on the spiritual quality, the power to inspire others to follow. And this spiritual quality may be for good or may be for evil. In many cases, this quality has been devoted toward personal ends.

Speaker 3:          01:48:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:48:28       And was partly or wholly evil. And whenever this was. So in the end it failed for leadership, which is evil. While it may temporarily succeed, always carries within it the seeds of its own destruction. That's it. That's it. That's a solid one. Leadership, which is evil, while it may temporarily succeed, always carries within it the seeds of its own destruction. And that is a theory that I fully believe it.

Speaker 3:          01:49:10       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:49:11       And I mean, I believe in it on that level,

Speaker 3:          01:49:17       on that

Speaker 1:          01:49:19       hi consequence level.

Speaker 3:          01:49:22       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:49:23       But I also believe it on a, on a much less dramatic level. And this is something that you deal with every day.

Speaker 3:          01:49:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:49:30       Yeah. And that's this, the leader that is looking out for himself, the leader that puts himself above his team, that leaders eventually going to fail.

Speaker 3:          01:49:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:49:41       Even though they may temporarily succeed. Same thing. They may temporarily succeed, but eventually they are going to fail. That's what's going to happen. And I will tell you something else that is true and that is the opposite is the of that. And that is if you are doing the right things for the right things, for the right reasons, then you may temporarily fail. But you will have the seeds for victory, the seeds for victory. And the reason that I say seeds is very specific. There's a reason why I'm saying that is because seeds are not guaranteed to grow, right? Just because you have good intention doesn't mean that you're going to win. It doesn't mean that you're going to achieve victory. It means we have the seeds for victory because once you plant those seeds, you have to water them and you have to nourish them and you have to protect them from birds and from squirrels and from vermin. And you have to work. You have to plant those seeds and then you have to make those seeds grow. And if you do that and you continue to do that, then you move forward and you're doing it for the right reasons. In the end you are going to win.

Speaker 1:          01:51:09       And you know that that middle section of this Monte went pretty deep talking about morale and he has a whole nother section here that I've got on Robin. I think we're gonna save that for another podcast since we're all ready. Two hours, dude. Until then, Echo Charles. If we want to keep our morale high, if we want to nourish the seeds and we want to protect them, sure. And we want to do the right things for the right reason. Always so that we can win. Yes. Dominate or we are we doing dominate, kind of looking at them and they were looking to dominate, possibly looking to dominate. When I'm looking at dominate men. No, but you gotta you gotta be able to, we'll probably come, we'll revisit that word. Yeah. Full. We'll do the full study of that word and dig deep. At a minimum it means, hey, we're going to dominate.

Speaker 1:          01:52:11       It's got dominates the room in a positive way. Yeah. At the extreme. It's like this guy just has a dominant personality. Prom is how often do you see with a person with a dominant personality that rubs everyone the wrong way all the time. Dominant like Domini or yeah, this guy's got to dominate and no one, no one wants them on the team cause you can't get a word in edge wise. That's why I questioned the use of this word. Now that being said, and I can see this, I can see this, just because someone has the will to dominate and it's strong doesn't mean that they sit there and rub everyone the wrong way because if they really had the will to dominate, what they would do is back off and allow others to step up and allow others to have their say and allow others to try and lead and to actually lead.

Speaker 1:          01:53:01       If they were really going to play the game, they might have the strongest will to dominate, but they don't act that way because they realize that that's counterproductive to actually dominating. Yeah. You look like you're confused. I mean, yeah. I mean, I don't know. So check it out, confused. But I think that if I feel like there's just, there's a more general broad use or meaning for that word. That's what I think. So I think you're right. That being said, it could also be if you have somebody that has a strong, incredibly powerful will to dominate, but they realize that that is abrasive and it is not the best way to actually win in a situation, they will modulate and they will tamper that will to dominate so that it best serves the accomplishment of the mission and therefore best serves their domination. Yeah, and I dig it.

Speaker 1:          01:54:06       You know, it just does feel at this by this point right now it feels like that might be kind of a reach. It's like that, um, thing that I talked about at the muster of, of what is, what is leadership and, and I talk about how like leadership is winning at all costs. And there's been some people that say, woof, winning at all costs seems like a bad attitude, but the whole, cause you put a clip like that for an advertisement for the muster in a little muster clip. Sure. You put me going, leadership is winning at all costs. Right. And there was some of that combination commented on our, on the echelon front, extreme ownership, Facebook private group that you know, I don't know if I like, this is a seems a little bit, that doesn't seem like a good attitude and you know, I replied that, hey, you have to hear the whole thing.

Speaker 1:          01:55:00       That's only, that's only a few seconds. Because when it goes on to say is if you really want to win, then you'll compromise. Then you'll make exceptions. Then you build relationships and you'll take a back step and you'll put your, you will subordinate your ego. That was the biggest thing. That's the biggest myth. We will subordinate your ego because you will put the mission above your own personal will to dominate. You'll, you'll subordinate your will to dominate so that you can actually win in the long term. In the long game. Yeah. And it's important to remember if you heard it here, the whole speech or would it, or the whole segment will say is that yeah, you

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       talk like a lot about, um, where like dislike battles and then there's the overall victory and like this, all this stuff and then sure, there's the dramatic parts when you're like, nothing's going to get in my way. But yeah, like you sacrifice so much where, okay, so when you say we need all costs, it kind of, this is what it sounds like. You've, you just hear that line, nothing's going to get him mind. It sounds like even at the cost of lighting, half of my men or something, I ended up not only that, but in a corporate world, it's like I'll just step on anyone I need to write. I'll send bad product out to the consumers and I don't care if they get hurt her, but I don't care if it's, I don't care, whatever, I'm just going to win. I'm here. Yeah. Like that.

Speaker 4:          01:56:23       Yeah. That's, that's what people think. So in that guy's defense, it sounds like that. But again, the whole speech, it really, I mean really the one of the main, actually the takeaway, if not anything, is like winning. What is winning? Like w you know, if I lose half of my men, it did you really win? I think you actually say that exact thing. He's like, no, that's not, it's not a victory. But also how can you carry on with your mission and your mission and capable. Now I'm actually putting, I'm actually putting that, I'm going to, I'm going to write that down, capture that, and I'm going to Redo it for ETF online. What? That part? Yeah. You know, so that way people can understand what winning at all costs. What it means when I'm talking about, yeah. So we'll put that on e f on line.

Speaker 4:          01:57:08       If anybody wants to check that out. If you don't know what that is, you, if online is a interactive leadership training from my company Echelon Front where we traveled the world teaching companies, businesses, organizations about leadership in the course of doing that, we eventually got to a point where a, we couldn't serve us all the people that wanted our service and B, some of the companies that we could service, we couldn't service all their employees because they have 50,000 employees and they want to have everyone get trained to by echelon front. So talking to Lafe during a board meeting or you surf meaning? Yes. So Lafe and I were surfing, I said a brother, we need to figure out a way to scale this stuff and we, you know, I said, let's, let's look at doing something online. And Lafe was initially like, which makes sense by the way.

Speaker 4:          01:58:08       Yeah, for sure. No, and I, I, I wanted to explore it. I wasn't like all in out of the gate, but I was feeling pretty good about it because I'd seen some stuff Lafe really hadn't seen anything. You know, he basically seen, well you used to get trained online in the navy for some just the most ridiculous sort of, uh, things. They'd send you some online training course about if you get a Dui, this is, you know, check this box if you think you're going to be in trouble, you know, they're just really not the best training. And that's kind of what life had in mind. But eventually we to take

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       a look at it and once we looked at it, it's like, oh man, there's the capabilities. Unbelievable to do interactive training and all that stuff. So we invested in it, we did it and now we've got this thing and we're using it primarily we were using it primarily for our, for our enterprise clients. So we're national in front of is working with a company and they go, well, what are we going to do with our other 14,000 employees? How are we going to train them? Well here you go now. Now, that's where they're doing their training through that great feedback and you know the, the decision was, well you know there's not, everyone is in a big company and so maybe some of the smaller companies or just individuals cause cause sometimes you know, look at some of those people come to the muster and they're paying their own way to come to the monster obviously and their, their companies not supporting it but they want to improve.

Speaker 1:          01:59:31       So that's why they're there at the muster. Well it's the same thing with the half online. Something sometimes you might just do it on your own because you want to become a better leader and why not get the experience of the echelon front team, the, the principles in practice you get to try them. So that's, that's what it is. So anyways, where we add modules every month, like new training and so I'm going to put the what is leadership and the winning at all costs thing on there so people can listen to what that's really about and what it really means. Yeah. That broader views important in my opinion. Also what's important in my opinion, is the ghee you get for Jujitsu when you're doing, you did to us. Here's the thing, when you started just doing, you put on a key, you don't have any basis for comparison.

Speaker 1:          02:00:19       You're not gonna understand how important that is. Do you want to put it on a straight jacket when you take a drive around the block? No. Correct. Sometimes you have to her, but you didn't do and that's what it'll feel like if you buy one of these other gies. Yeah, sometimes. Anyway, so the g you get his origin, you get an origin g many selections on there. Yeah. To fit who you are and also there's genes on there. Yes, it is. Yeah. Did I say origin jeans made America American Denim, American denim and they don't have are alive. Well, you need to order a pair then. Oh, all right. Maybe I'll get some. Okay. There you go. Yeah, they're alive. They are awesome. Highest quality possible. Every detail go. If you want to find out what cause the genes there. Right now the price point is 124 bucks. That's a lot of money for a pair of jeans. I understand that if you buy two pairs is 99 bucks each. Here's the deal. If you want to know why they cost that much, going on to origin Bjj, um, Facebook and watch [inaudible] video where he breaks down

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       the details in the genes. You can see the whole thing. Why every little detail is covered. Denim pockets, belt, every little thing is done perfectly to the next level and so they're more expensive. They're also more expensive cause we're just kicking it off once we get, once we keep building him we'll get more efficient. So yeah, eventually the price is gonna come down if you can't afford it right now. I man, that's cool. That's cool. I get it. Do genes have the whole situation of the first at dish? Well they are technically right now you can get first. The first judicious. Yeah, but that would be like a first batch of them first. The rashes is live right now. Yeah, go first. A dish. Right. You ever seen those like designer jeans that cost like $300 how they're made. This is where if you see people that are scraping them with rocks and stuff, cause I've seen this, it's worse than that.

Speaker 4:          02:02:30       So they get like regular jeans, whatever, and it's a certain color and it just denim from wherever and they, you know, this factory in, I forget where, but you know, a factory in a factory in China treat. Yeah. I think it's China, Pakistan or in India. And there's uh, uh, you know, these little kids that are nine years old exposed to chemicals. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I saw the one I saw on a little bit. It was more team than that, but nonetheless, they were like super, like they're like $300 jeans or to fish or something like this. And they go and the way they're made, I'm like, Bro, how is it, how is that even worth $300? Like they, they cut the jeans like normal and it's like denim, you know, whatever. And then they do them and they put like this steam on them and then they send it to the next person, the next station in the factory.

Speaker 4:          02:03:17       The next station has this like it's almost like a, like a fishing line on a, what do you call like a wheel, like a tomato look abused or whatever. That's exactly right. So it goes and it spins on the genes and it makes it look a certain level of abuse or whether to, what do you call it? Distress, distress. And then it goes to the next little station and the, and this person at this station is just doing every single one. Same thing, put up a book, next station. The next station has like a little another thing to help it kind of do it. Then the next session folded. And so I watched that thing with Pete and my point and I'm like, Oh man, that makes sense. This all makes sense. Like this is deep, you know, there's good made me want to get one obviously.

Speaker 4:          02:03:56       But I thought back to that factory and I'm thinking, man, how is that worth like $300 or whatever for that thing. It was such a throwaway process like when you, when you see it and feel it. So I dig it man. It d and they are made in America by the way. Yeah, for sure. They're made in America than made in Maine. There the cottons from America has died in America. It's woven in America and yeah, the price point is, is more expensive than what you're going to pay. And Hey, you know, I don't want you to go out and spend your last dollar on this pair of origin jeans. No Man. But if you want to help out and you want the bay, they all have the best possible genes you get. If you want them, then cool. That'd be cool.

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       Yup. But don't need to freak out. I'm not freaking out on my end. We're trying to make good, we're trying to make good quality products and our real mission is longterm mission to bring manufacturing back to America. You know, we want these, we want to get these jeans down to a price point. How do we do that? Increase the volume, make more of them. There'll be economies of scale. We'll be able to lower the prices for sure. Absolutely. You know what? We talked to some gene people, Denim people, they, they, they wanted us to charge $300 for these jeans. Yeah. Cause they're like, well, you know, these are, wait, what did they say? They were premium. Yeah. Premium jeans. But there was another word too. Anyways, you know there's, there's people that pay that kind of money for jeans. I'm not one of them.

Speaker 4:          02:05:25       Yeah, no, you know, I don't know. But anyways, yeah, either way. Well the good news about the whole situation, including made in America, they do have other stuff. So an eighth man, I haven't talked about these shorts. So, and I don't know if you notice what I wear all the time, but the only thing I wear is the shorts only one straight up. I mean, unless it's like, you know, to train or something like this. But like just around is only the origin shorts, shark sharks or whatever. Yeah. I have like six pairs of them and it's like the same thing. So I'm sure it's like, you know, if you go through your routine, like people at the store, they're like proud Skype. Where's the same shorts every day, but well one of them has a green logo, the other one has a black logo. Either way. These are literally the best shorts in the like ever made that I've put on straight up. Yes. So I can get those Charlie. There you go. Custom made in the mirror. He Oh, big time. And I'm so that's for real though.

Speaker 1:          02:06:17       Well you also said that about their dark chocolate.

Speaker 4:          02:06:21       Well those are the most comfortable for sure. And and well, let's show you were, and I tried on Joggers, I told me about it. Yeah. Ridiculous. Then the whole idea. So sounds ridiculous. You don't have a Jogger, uh, what do you call physique? Yeah. What do you need to, what's the geography? I like skinny. I don't know that I can put my finger on what exactly a geography is, but I can tell you that I don't, you don't have it. Yes sir. I confirmed that. Yes. So don't worry about the joggers. If you're Jocko button. If for anyone else, those joggers are factually in the most comfortable. A jogger sweat situation close

Speaker 1:          02:07:06       in exists currently. Currently they've got some supplements to a joint warfare. Krill oil discipline discipline. Go. We were on a Skype or a or a yeah, this business Skype call today and Jason Gardner was on and he, you know, you can you have a little video?

Speaker 4:          02:07:25       My little video, I don't know which one. Jake. No little video like Skype, Skype. You know what Skype is? It's video comp. Video teleconferencing. Yes. What you mean Jason Gardeners like, like pulls out his bottle of discipline going opens it up and like takes one in. Yo, Jason's super animated, you know, and he gets this big smile on his face because he took a couple hits in the discipline go anyways, so we got that. Good. If you need to get in the zone. We also have milk, mint, milk, peanut butter, milk, vanilla, gorilla, the darkness, chocolate and now live strawberry, strawberry, slayer, moldy, strawberry slayer. Oh boy. All right, so let me tell you, get that strawberry is just straight up. Get that strawberry. That thing is a dessert. Dang. Okay. So we like, I don't know how well it's, it's the, the kids, the warrior could moke which some strawberries.

Speaker 4:          02:08:24       Awesome. The chocolate's good to strawberries. Awesome. The chocolate's good to strawberries. Awesome. And I didn't think I just was telling Bryan like, no, hey man, I don't care. Just put a bigger scoop in and whatever. Just re duplicated. But you know, he's like, no, it's kind of more protein. It's adults, blah blah blah. And somehow he made it. It's actually, it's actually better or at least as good. It might be so good dude. It's so good. It's ridiculous. It's a straight up desert. It tastes like a milkshake straight up. If you mix it with milk, which is what I mix it with. It tastes like a Straw Berry milkshake. It tastes better than a strawberry milkshake. So if he's so good, it's ridiculous. You go blind taste tests, you've got all the protein that you need. Here you go. And then you have um, blind taste test, right?

Speaker 4:          02:09:12       You've got to imagine, cause you know the difference. I get it. So you have a, a cop, you know, war. You could milk strawberry adult. We'll just, we'll just say milk strawberry. Right. Which one are you going to choose? Which one are you, you, you, you, I think I'm going to go for the adult. I thought you were gonna throw a, uh, a Haagen daas strawberry shake. And here's the deal. I'm not picking the Haagen. Daas is too much. It's too much. It's too much. Yeah. That's kind of why I didn't say it. And it's not even, it's not even too much in a good way. It's too much in a bad way. It's like, it's like you don't want to drink it. The strawberry Mulkey you're like just pounding it. Yeah. Three. Her, she feeling good about things. Interesting. All right, well I'm gonna try it, Ellen, because I have no, actually, wait d I think he, he should have put some in the mail.

Speaker 4:          02:10:00       It just, it just came out. I have not tried it yet, but I will report back 100% Jocko. White Tea as well. Yes. Don't forget about that. Yeah. It'll get you 20,000 pound dead lift, which is no big deal to some people. To me, it's kind of a big deal. And this organic by the way. So you know, percent organic certified check also. Yes, we have a store. Jocko has a store. So I made a video is fun about, it was nothing like super in depth, but you know, he got all our friends training partners are people call you got Noah Noah Oliver. No one's got good arm locks. Yeah, he's actually been like, I mean on top of Greg Macintyre. He, he's been kind of my main training partner recently. The past few months. Yeah. The main one. Yeah. So him. Yes. No Oliver. Greg Mcintyre. Greg tray is in there. We got nay Dene, nay Dene Belgium may dean, um, Tim Ford.

Speaker 4:          02:11:03       Did I say Greg Mack attack? He's all up in there. Yeah. Oh, you got Dave Burke. Good deal. Good deal. Days in there. Jamie's in there. Jamie. Yeah. Um, and then the kids. Can we say whose kids there? There's some kids in there. We'll just say there's some kids in there. Yes, they're not. My kids are not echo kids, but they don't make kids do their warrior kids. We know. What, don't worry kids a hundred thousand percent. Yeah. So yeah, the deans in their teams there anyway, the point is they're just our friend. He was just this cool, fun video Jocko story. You want to do, you want something get or if you like something to get something nonetheless Jocko, store.com this is where you can get the shirts that say discipline equals freedom if you want to represent in the wild on the path. How is this? When I was um, this was a while ago, so my, my, I had an extra shirt later on.

Speaker 4:          02:11:51       It was a size medium for the that you wear. See what's funny is I need, you can say that, I know you're going to say Sunday that anyway, I'm taking pictures for this. You know, you've got to take pictures for the products for the store and for whatever reason, the size medium, that's the best looking size I guess for pictures. I Dunno nonetheless take the picture of him, but I have it laying around, right? So my wife is like, oh this is extra shirt and you know, can I give it to like one of my friends or whatever and I wasn't, I had no use for the shirt at this point. And I said no because I don't know if their friend is like going to represent, you know, I don't know if the friend is on the path. What if the friend's not on the path and they're wearing that shirt that's, you know, it's different.

Speaker 4:          02:12:31       There's more to it. That's what it feels like. You see what I'm saying? It's true story nonetheless. When you are on the path and you want to represent in the wild, you just go to Jocko store.com I was at the Joe Rogan show. Sure. The four 24 20 and San Diego with Peter Attia. Yeah. And we were with a bunch of other dudes and Peter was reminding me that on Twitter somebody had said, hey Jocko, I wasn't in the seal teams but I want to show support to the seals. Is it cool if I were like a navy seal? Trident on my hat for tee shirt. And my response was, I was in the seal teams for 20 years and I don't wear a seal team hat or tee shirt.

Speaker 4:          02:13:28       Wait, so does that mean yes or no? That means no. Hell No. Right? Because, okay, so coincidentally me and good deal, Dave Burke, we're talking about the exact same thing. So I forget how we ended up talking about it, but I was like, Hey, what's the, what's the, cause he gave me his uniform, I was doing something with it for video wise. So I don't know, for whatever reason we ended up talking about what like what can, you were like, what can not wear, what's off limits on this thing? And he told me it was like, you know, some stuff in me but I don't know. So he had to sort of explain it to me and that's essentially the scenario he painted. He was like, you know how like the navy seals, like they have the trident. Like you can't just put on a train it, you know, like, like if you're not that you bring the, tried it here, but let's say for whatever reason you read, I can't just grab it and then like kind of put it on even as like for fun. No, it's like Beth that's kind of off limits, you know, you can't say. And then so you made the comparison to Jujitsu belt too. Like if I grabbed your black belt and put it on, granted you're kind of my friend. I could never, let's say, let's say I wasn't listening, I wasn't even a white belt. Let's say. I was like even like a purple belt and my instructor who I wasn't necessarily personal friends with, but that was happening to be my instructor. I can't put that belt on.

Speaker 1:          02:14:40       What if you use it? What if you forgot your belt? He was injured and he was on the sidelines and he's like, oh, just wear mine. Would you wear it?

Speaker 4:          02:14:47       Never do that. But what's funny is Dave Burke brought that exact scenario up. Different colors though. So he got good question. When someone was like, Hey, just where mine, it's a blue belt. He said he's in, uh, the guy he was training with, I think it was a blue belt that he was training with. He was like, Hey, I have an extra one. You don't have a belt, you need a belt to to, you know, the train and stuff like that. Gives him his blue belt. Dave Burke said out of respect for the guys, like, you know, suggestion, he wore it but he did not feel good about it at all. And I think, I think that's kind of the deal where if some higher belts

Speaker 1:          02:15:18       I used to give guys, like in the, if they started trading I'd give them a piece of one inch, two tubular. Nylon Green. Yeah. Which is just like to tie their belt. Do you remember any Cameron using ABC. Okay. Right. Okay. Yeah. Camp Good Jiu Jitsu by the way, the wrestler and strong wrong. Yes. So he came to mind is the guy that, you know, Cameron came to my house and tamed the beast. You know the, you know what that is with Kettlebell tame the beast. You get the 48 kilogram Kettlebell, which you don't have one that big? Yes I do. I'll have a nice, so I have one, but before I had those, he ordered one and he was like in between houses at the time. So he, so he ordered a, had it sent to my house. He gets it. He comes to my house first time he's ever picked up a 48 kilogram hundred and six pound kettle bell. And there's a thing called taming the beast, which is you do a press with that kettle bell, you do a pistol with that kettle bell and then you do a pull up with that kettle bell. And the first time he ever did it, he did it. He did it right in front of them. Did it all right. Like no warmup. Just, just did it.

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       Yeah. And that's quite a lot cause he's not a large get like I'm bigger than him. He's like what? [inaudible] 95 yeah, maybe one nine. Yeah, I, yeah, I might give him like one nonetheless. Yeah, that's saying a lot. No, that's the point I bring him up is because the first time he ever trained Geek because I trained with them before and I was like, oh this guy's probably at the time, this was years ago, I was like, you was probably, I was a purple belt. So I was like, this guy is probably like a purple belt too. So you know, whatever. I trained with him one day he comes in in the Geek, so I'm like, Oh shit. You know that little parties like kind of like, oh yeah, like you know, let me confirm. We don't want to, but he has a piece of that green that Darlene, and here's the thing, he doesn't just stand out because it's like it's Kinda dark or whatever.

Speaker 4:          02:17:17       But you see new guy come, you know, cause he's Sorta, you know how when you come and train for the first time and g and some classes, kind of like most of those people, they kind of [inaudible]. Exactly right. But this guy is a new guy. I knew who he was. So I was like looking at, I'm like, okay, that's obviously a military piece of equipment. It's not a belt. It was funny, the looks on everyone's face, they'll like this, like you're kind of looking at each other as the whole world gone crazy. It's really funny. But that's how rigid the belt situation is though. That's why you can't just grab a guy's belt. And as I know people, not specific people, but it would stand to reason, put it that way. It would stand to reason that even as a joke, if I grabbed like, you know, it's funny as a joke, I've been like here just where mine, like some people, you know, I've just been like giving people my black belt.

Speaker 4:          02:18:03       Like, Oh, you know, like a, like a blue belt or a boy here, you just were mine. And that give it to me like, like awkwardly awkwardly, make them do it. That's how the dynamics of that, you know, before I really knew Jeff Glover, yeah, he came down here and did a seminar and he's like, Hey, I don't have a belt. And I was like, yeah, you can use mine. And I was really, I was actually worried. Yeah, we had one belt. I've only had one belt my whole time, like one black belt and I was worried. I was like, Dang. I mean, not that I thought he was going to like steal it, but I just was afraid. Oh you know, you know he'll, he'll put in his bag and next thing you know it's in Santa Barbara and the next thing you know, I'll never see my belt again.

Speaker 4:          02:18:40       My special belt. Yeah. I was there for that day when he did it because we wasn't here though. I wasn't here. That was more, I like what's here and I had to go. Yeah. And so I didn't get to, but he hung it back up. Jeffy Glover took care of it. I took a picture of him that day. Oh really rough to see if he was where my belt, he is wearing your belt and the picture and he's doing this and that picture ended up being used for a bunch of different stuff. That's kind of cool. Then my belt made it kind of famous with Jeff. He if you notice like the belt is a little bit long. It's fun. Oh yeah. Cause I'm thicker than he is. Yeah we'll you have like a what you know the belt comes with three. Yeah. And he's probably, he's Ne one for sure cause you have 55 yup.

Speaker 4:          02:19:18       There it is. So don't do that. Don't seal team two who is just an incredibly well respected guy in the day he had, I think he had two sons and he was giving them like a, like a hat, like a seal team, two hat or something that had to try done on it or he had an old one that he was going to giving to his son's like hey I'm not going to wear this and it's too old. And he made them cut the Triton off of it. If they wanted to wear it. I was like yes I dig it. And there's all those kinds of things, you know, like if even on a super lower level, like, you know, if you made it through some little thing, like I don't know, like one of these spartan races or something that you only get this shirt or hat if you did it, you know. And even then there's a little, I mean it's, it's way more loose for sure. But you know, like your wife puts it on or something and you're like, people like don't do that. That, yeah, man. I know my daughter, I know my daughter present in that state. A state wrestling championships. Those kids up there, they're buying those shirts and sweatshirts. I got to read about what if you came home and your wife had, you're trading on, why would my wife had lunches because she's trying to represent, well, I'll just take it from her.

Speaker 4:          02:20:32       No, actually there's a thing where there's a thing where like a seal will give his wife like a little necklace when I tried it on it. Okay. You know, that's sort of their why. So she doesn't take his going to be, no, I don't think she'd be trying to take his, but I think it's just, you know, little appreciation. Yeah, fully. But no, but no, my wife knows what's up. You know? My wife does not one of those. Yeah, I know she doesn't make sense. So that's kind of how it is. Right. When the shirts from Jocko store kind of, I mean, not to that level, but I put it this way. If I see someone wearing representing, I know that they're representing, I know they're on the pathway. They're not just some guy who person or whatever. That's not in the past. It doesn't seem like that.

Speaker 4:          02:21:15       Oh, they're definitely in the game. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, they're definitely in the game. That's what it feels like. Well, there you go. Also subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already. I know. Seems obvious, but apparently it's not as obvious from what I gather. Nonetheless, subscribe if you haven't already, and by the way, if you get a piece of gear, it supports the podcast. Is that important? We'll, is it important? Depends on what you mean by important. So yes. Yeah. I mean it's important to let people know that the one additional bonus of representing is you're actually helping out the podcast support. We're going to get a new table by the way, which has been a 100 yeah, this one. It wiggles a lot. It's ridiculous. Echo Charles is table. This is one of those things where like an apt punishment would be you had to bring this to your house and use it as your dining room table for a year.

Speaker 4:          02:22:10       Oh my gosh. No. Yeah, yeah. This is a good day. Why? You know the picture looked nice. Check. All right, so we're going to get a new table. If you buy a tee shirt, we can get a new table that's not going to fall down and all that. But we appreciate that support too.
