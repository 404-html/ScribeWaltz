00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,910
This is Jocko podcast number
91 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,000
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,640
And we are rolling straight
into Q and a today.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,350
So questions from the interwebs.
Echo Charles Gulf

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,740
go. Okay, first question

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,850
Jocko. I've just finished about
faith, the book, amazing book,

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,510
interested how you modeled your style on
Hackworth though hack was a renegade in

8
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:39,900
always bending the rules to
break to the breaking point,

9
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,480
but in extreme ownership he talk about,
for example,

10
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:46,380
not pushing back on higher command
when it came to Iraqi troops.

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,320
Have listened to podcasts too,

12
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,670
but was hoping you could go
into it a bit more. Yeah,

13
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,270
so I guess that that's a good question.
Hack.

14
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,400
He was kind of considering a renegade,
but,

15
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,320
but also he's also a total company man
that you got to realize that there's that

16
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:07,710
dichotomy there. There's a
guy that hack, loved the army,

17
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,690
he loved the army, he wanted his
uniform would look super squared away.

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,020
He followed all the rules
and regulations that,

19
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:21,021
and he supported the leadership all the
time when the leadership was right and

20
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:23,970
that's what makes him a good renegade.

21
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,070
In my opinion and I was very much the
same way. I was all about the navy.

22
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,580
You know, I was all about the
games as a matter of fact tone.

23
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:35,320
You know what Tony used to say?
Uh,

24
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,970
it was a little thing we got going
in to you bruiser that spread around.

25
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:42,810
But of course it came from Tony First,
which was all navy all the time.

26
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,680
We'd just be joking
about, you know, I think,

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,840
I don't know what originally caused it,

28
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:53,841
but like guys would make fun of me because
I would wear like jungle boots or Dan

29
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:57,630
or boots out too on liberty with
a clear of like old jeans. Yeah.

30
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,580
Cause when you're, when you're like that
kind of old just raised in the teams,

31
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,500
you don't even know any
different and you're like,

32
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,560
oh well I'm going out and I need to wear
shoes. Cool. Where's my jungle boots?

33
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,220
That's what you end up like. And,
and you're into it. You're not like,

34
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,160
you think it's good. You think it's
normal. Like this is the way things are.

35
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,640
And so I supported the teams and
hack supported the army of course.

36
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,690
But this is the thing,

37
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,290
if the leadership was wrong or there
was something being passed down that was

38
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,070
wrong and it was a big wrong,
like if it was a little,

39
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,980
I wouldn't be like, Oh man, this is crap.

40
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:35,580
They're making us wear a
different pair of shorts now.

41
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:36,630
Because like that would happen.

42
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,460
Like some new commanding officer would
come in and change some thing, right.

43
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,620
And some, well we got to do that. We're,
it's like, dude, be quiet. You know,

44
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:48,600
just be quiet. Do you know they're giving
you a new shorts where the new shorts,

45
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,780
you know, oh, they're telling us we
can't wear baseball hats anymore. Cool.

46
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:55,680
Don't wear baseball hats. And
some grass would go, who cares?

47
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,920
I don't care what I'm wearing
on my head. You know, like,

48
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,090
oh you want to issue with different
ball caps are fine, whatever.

49
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,760
But then if it was a larger issue then or,

50
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:09,100
or obviously if it was something
that was like actually wrong,

51
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:12,250
like criminally wrong or morally wrong
or something like that, then yeah,

52
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:14,260
I'd be like, no, we can't do that.

53
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,980
So the reason that I didn't push back
on Iraqi troops in working with Iraqi

54
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:25,690
troops when we got to Ramadi
was because as I looked at it,

55
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,760
I realized that it was the
right thing to do and yes,

56
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:33,250
it was going to be more dangerous.
And yes,

57
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,260
a definitely took us
out of our comfort zone.

58
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,410
But as I explain in extreme ownership,

59
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,530
if we didn't train those people up,

60
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,740
if we didn't train the Iraqi soldiers
and take them out and get them fighting

61
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,170
and get them squared
away on the battlefield,

62
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,250
then Americans would have
been doing it forever.

63
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:56,210
So it was the correct call was to do that.
Now I've,

64
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:01,570
I've talked about the same, same
thing. When they told us our ratio,

65
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,290
they gave us a ratio of how many Iraqis
we had to have for every one Iraqi we

66
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:08,840
had to have, I don't know what their,
I forget what the number was, seven or,

67
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,000
or for every one seal we had
to have seven Iraqi soldiers.

68
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:15,670
They said that something like that.
I forget what the numbers were.

69
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,420
And I said,
no,

70
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,790
that doesn't make sense to us because
sometimes we only have 10 guys to go out

71
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:22,420
and I'm,

72
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,980
there's no way I'm sending only one seal
with 10 Iraqi soldiers not doing it.

73
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,610
Need a corpsman, need to
radio man, need a machine,

74
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:34,450
gunner need a leader like
that. That's what I need. So,

75
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,230
and when I pushed back because I didn't
push back against ball caps and because

76
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:42,880
I didn't push back against
some stupid uniform change, ah,

77
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,220
they were like, oh yeah, well that
actually makes sense. Chocolate.

78
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:47,530
We don't want you to go on
the field with only one seal.

79
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,540
So I would clearly pushed back if it
was something that didn't make sense.

80
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,360
Same thing with like the martial arts
training that they had us doing in the,

81
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:59,530
in the late nineties and early
two thousands. It was not good.

82
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,640
And I was told everyone, hey, this
is not smart. This is not good.

83
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,870
This training is dumb. We need to
do other training that's better. Uh,

84
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,040
and, and same thing,
you know, things go, oh,

85
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,930
like here's another like stupid example.

86
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,070
They wouldn't want to issue
a platoon that the radio was,

87
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:21,160
you are going to take on deployment
because they didn't want you to break them

88
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:26,050
or whatever. And so they'd issue
not enough radios for everyone.

89
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:28,870
And so now not everyone does know how to
operate the radios and you're basically

90
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:31,990
operationally testing the radios while
you're going through your workup.

91
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,280
So I said, hey, this is garbage issue,
everyone radios if that's how we operate,

92
00:05:36,281 --> 00:05:38,050
that's how we need to train.
Gotcha.

93
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,390
So in the training they would
an issue that the radios, yeah,

94
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:43,180
there was a time period where we low on
radios and they said we're going to keep

95
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:45,430
these radios for deployment and it's,
that doesn't make sense.

96
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,330
I got a good idea by more
radios. Uh, so, you know,

97
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:52,540
those were things I pushed back on it
and you were always pushing back on the

98
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,060
type of training that was going
to happen and who is going to be,

99
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,310
how you're going to run
the training. So, um,

100
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,500
when something we didn't
made sense to push back,

101
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,020
I pushed back just like Hackworth did.
Now,

102
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:09,380
Hackworth did it on a massive
scale because he eventually
pushed back on the way

103
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:11,060
the war in Vietnam was being run.

104
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,930
And had I been smart enough and the war
didn't take the shift that it took and

105
00:06:17,571 --> 00:06:21,050
we didn't move towards counterinsurgency
and we didn't make those adjustments

106
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:25,580
that the, that carnal McFarland
implemented in Ramadi. Maybe,

107
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,730
maybe, I doubt it. Maybe I would
have been smarter to say, Hey,

108
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:29,810
we're not running this war right.

109
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:32,300
We need to do something different and
run it up the chain of command. But,

110
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,190
but at the time, you know, Colonel
Mcfarlane made great decisions. He led,

111
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,930
he had a great plan, a great
strategy, so I was 100% on board. Um,

112
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,550
but if you don't Hackworth,
that didn't happen.

113
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,940
They were not fighting correctly
against the Vietnamese and,

114
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:52,450
and they were taking massive casualties
for a hill that two days later they'd

115
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,180
give back. And so he was saying, what
are you doing? And, and the other thing,

116
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:57,890
you know,
when he took over the hardcore battalion,

117
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,000
they were fighting for
months and they had,

118
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:06,110
they had literally killed almost,
no, anyway, I think it was zero.

119
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,610
I think there's actually zero enemy.

120
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,160
And yet they had taken all kinds of
casualties themselves. And so he'd say,

121
00:07:11,161 --> 00:07:15,440
w w this is wrong, this is
wrong. So I think that's,

122
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,330
that's what being a leader is. You support
the stuff, you support the command.

123
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,200
Yes, of course we support the command when
it makes sense and as long as it makes

124
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:26,720
sense and normally it's gonna make sense.
You know what I mean?

125
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:28,310
Normally it's going to make sense.
It's not like the,

126
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,100
the admirals and the generals are
saying, hey, how can we lose this war?

127
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:33,770
Let's come up with a stupid strategy.
No, they're doing the best they can.

128
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,710
So it's not like it's a regular
occurrence. I mean, like I said,

129
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:40,190
when I was working for Carter,
Colonel Mcfarland, he was a smart guy.

130
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,030
He was a brilliant guy that had a great
strategy of, I'm like, okay, awesome.

131
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,590
I'm here to support. Um, and, and
I'll tell you when I did, and this is,

132
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:49,490
I think this is important,

133
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,410
is that even though I was kind of a
renegade and I was more rebellious when I

134
00:07:54,411 --> 00:07:58,460
was a kid, obviously I, I was, uh, I was
young when I got the seal teams then. So,

135
00:07:58,461 --> 00:08:00,800
you know, we would push all of
those things where I said that, oh,

136
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:04,940
we got to do this. That was me when I was
at e four in the seal teams. You know,

137
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,590
what do we go do that we should just be
able to do whatever we want. You know,

138
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,270
we were just stupid.
But as I got older,

139
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,600
I realized that you need to
come across as a renegade quote,

140
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:20,300
unquote, to come across as a
big rebel. That doesn't, well,

141
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,330
immediately when you go and push back on
something, everyone just dismisses you.

142
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,120
Oh yeah. Jocko, he's just
a loud mouth. He just,

143
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,100
he just pushed it back against
everything he doesn't want.

144
00:08:27,101 --> 00:08:29,990
He's wanting to do everything his
way. No. You want them to say, Oh wow,

145
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:34,130
hold on a second. If jockos pushing
back against this, then this,

146
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,220
this must be something wrong here because
he doesn't push back against stuff.

147
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:39,380
He tells the line all the time
so we should listen to them.

148
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,150
That's what you want to build.

149
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,360
That's what I did my best to build and
that's how I think it would be comparable

150
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,960
to the way Hackworth led
and the way that I tried to,

151
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,660
obviously I know Hackworth,

152
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,430
but I stole as much as I could
from him and the weird thing is,

153
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:58,470
I'll tell you this,
I always say I stole from him,

154
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,810
but it wasn't like I was sitting
there reading a book and going,

155
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,990
I'm going to do what he did here.

156
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,760
I think it was just absorbed and even
even the naming of tasking at bruiser,

157
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,610
like when I did it, I wasn't
thinking this is what Hackworth did,

158
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,220
but it was real obvious that
that's where I got it from. Like,

159
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,360
I didn't think I'm going
to rename this and again,

160
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,720
we're going to turn this thing around
based order would not turn it around,

161
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:24,990
but we're going to build this based
on, no, I was like, you know what?

162
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:28,870
We're not going to be Task Unit Bravo
cause that sounds lame or maybe task you

163
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:33,870
had a bruiser because that sounds
awesome. You and, and, and then later,

164
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:35,310
you know, I was like fuck. I'm
like, Oh God, that's right.

165
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,130
That's exactly what Hackworth did.
I obviously stole it from him,

166
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,420
so appreciate it. Act. But that's
what I'd say be a renegade.

167
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,260
But that's should be,
that should be in the background.

168
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:48,900
That should be in the back of your mind,
in the front of your mind. Should be, hey,

169
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,210
I'm a supporter of what's happening.

170
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:58,080
Kind of like the willingness to be a
real renegade if you have to. Yeah, yeah.

171
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,730
If you have to end,
believe me,

172
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:03,640
I've known all kinds of good seals
that were to renegade. Yeah, yeah.

173
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,740
That's just like I'm a Renick.
Yeah, they're just straight
up, hey, I'm a renegade.

174
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:11,490
And, and you know that just the only
guys that could get away with that,

175
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,260
well guys that were so ultimately
operationally squared away. Yeah.

176
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,470
That people go, yeah, you know, he's
kind of a maniac, but dude, he's really,

177
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,870
really good and really tactically
sound and all that. And they could,

178
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,260
they make that happen.
Now as you get more and more senior

179
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,060
homie don't play like that after
a certain point, it's done.

180
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:33,060
And you've got to get, you've got to
play the game. That's what you got to do.

181
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,560
As you get more senior,
got to play the game.

182
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:39,660
And from like your subordinates viewpoint,
if, if they looked at me and go,

183
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:44,400
oh, jock was just playing the
game. He's just doing it to
be guests. I am. Yes I am.

184
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,050
Because this way it gives me more ability
to control everything that's going to

185
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:52,170
impact you. People that
work for me. So yes,

186
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,440
I'm going to play the game so you
don't have to. You're welcome.

187
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,920
So yeah, check your math. Makes Sense.

188
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,610
Next question.
Jujitsu.

189
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:12,900
Bjj Do.
You did too during your time in Iraq,

190
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,210
if you like,
please paint me a picture.

191
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,700
How to imagine a Bjj class
from you as an active soldier.

192
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,350
Did you have a g maths and how would
it differ from a quote unquote normal

193
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,320
class? Um, so yeah,

194
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:33,321
I always brought mass with me starting
with 1998 I think is when I started

195
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:36,660
bringing maths with me. How do you
bring meth? She just be like, Hey,

196
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,750
in military transport you build
something called a pallet.

197
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:44,460
So you get a big palette and there
there's like eight feet by eight feet are

198
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:49,470
pretty big and you put stack all
kinds of stuff on them and you know,

199
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:53,680
you've got your weapons, you got
your engines, you got your motors,

200
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:58,030
you got your motors, you got your
boats, your, your Zodiac boats,

201
00:11:58,031 --> 00:11:59,470
you've got paddled,
you've got all this.

202
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,800
I mean all of the equipment [inaudible]
everyone's personal gear is on their,

203
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:05,770
their op gear, their body armor.
It's all of these big pallets.

204
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,290
And when you go on deployment,
you'll have eight pallets,

205
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,640
eight of these giant pallets.

206
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,170
And so on some of those pallets there
would be mats. So who is it up to though?

207
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,471
You know,

208
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:19,471
you're talking about weapons
and Zodiacs and stuff and like,

209
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,960
well whoever's in charge, which we're
seeing a lot of times this week.

210
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:29,290
So then it made it real easy and, and
even if it wasn't me, I mean everybody,

211
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,970
you know, if people are bringing something
to help everyone get better, you know,

212
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:37,240
I, yeah, that's cool. So in
that approval process, no man,

213
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,270
this guy's bringing all kinds of crazy
things. This man, I remember guys, well,

214
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,780
you know,
you guys should bring surfboards.

215
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:45,610
I mean they'd pack their
surfboards on pallets,

216
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:50,320
they pack a weights and squat
racks and anything that you want.

217
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,110
If you're going on a six month
deployment to remote location, yeah,

218
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:56,110
you're going to put your load, have a
squat rack and a bunch of bumper plates.

219
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,390
And if that remote location has waves,
you're packing surfboards. If it has,

220
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,960
if it has, you know, rock climbing,
you're going to pack rock climbing gear.

221
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:06,761
I'm telling you,

222
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:10,360
this is one of the things that
it's really hard to the seal teams.

223
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:13,570
It's really hard to have that.
I think we, I think in the,

224
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,070
the seal teams to have that better
than most people. It was just this,

225
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:23,110
this autonomy to kind of make things
happen and do kind of cool stuff.

226
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,740
And I'm not saying no, no one ever
gets to do that. But you know,

227
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:32,010
I don't think a regular
army unit or regular Marine
Corps unit would be putting,

228
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:37,450
you know, seven surfboards on their peers.
The where. So where's the limit though?

229
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:41,680
Like, so what can I, let's say
we're going, can we get a TV?

230
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,450
Can I get a tpa and PBM TVS? Like
the big screen. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

231
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:47,160
It just,

232
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,390
it also depends on where you're deploying
and what you're doing and what the

233
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:51,790
mission is. Because you
know, my first time to Iraq,

234
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:55,090
we didn't have much of any of
this stuff obviously. Right?

235
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:59,260
We just had our op gear basically.
And, but the second time,

236
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,510
the second time I went to Iraq,
we brought more,

237
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,320
but we actually had to weld a squat
rack is pretty awesome. There's a,

238
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,800
there's a marine that, there was a great
marine that was with us and he ran,

239
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,910
he manned the radios and he was just a,
just an awesome guy.

240
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,870
And he was, he was a marine, but he was,

241
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,940
there was marines across the river.

242
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,630
And so he was supposed to keep continuity
and he got assigned to US anyways.

243
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:26,080
Awesome guy.
And he knew how to weld.

244
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,990
He was from a farm up
in Montana or something,

245
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,320
so he knew how to weld and he had the
gear and we didn't have a squat rack.

246
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:36,480
And so our CBS, cause there's a
bunch of cvs with us. They get,

247
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,230
they were able to like just come up
with stuff. They make anything happen.

248
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,310
My,
My,

249
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:47,310
my head CB was just could see that's
CBS build things I think also acquire

250
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:53,720
things. Let's see. Comment builder.
It's a combat engineer battalion.

251
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:56,660
It's a construction battalion. That's
what it is. So it's CB for short,

252
00:14:56,661 --> 00:15:00,350
but it's the CBS and so yeah,

253
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:04,490
they build things and they also are
very good at acquiring things. You know,

254
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:07,250
things just show up at your,
at your base.

255
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:10,820
And my guys were awesome at acquiring
things and we didn't have a squat rack,

256
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,200
which is, which is crazy to me to
be having no squat rack. Right. Why,

257
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,470
why don't you have a squat rack? So
this, this marine welded a squat rack.

258
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:22,340
Now here's the interesting part,
the squat rack, he was, he was tall,

259
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,750
he was like maybe six, four,
six, five, maybe not that
tall, but he was a mean guy,

260
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,830
the marine welder. So on the
squat rack there was, you know,

261
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,600
there's adjustable to put the bar on.
Well this didn't have adjustable things.

262
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:40,070
It just had two hooks and there was one
hook at his height or one set of hooks

263
00:15:40,071 --> 00:15:42,080
at his height and one set
of hooks at my height.

264
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:45,060
Everyone just had to figure
it out from there, you know?

265
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,920
But uh, but yeah, so yeah,
you could bring, you could
bring that if you want it to.

266
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,010
And so, so yes, we brought maths,

267
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,760
I brought maths on that
deployment and both actually,

268
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:59,870
both of my deployment to Iraq brought
mats. And then one of the classic,

269
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,240
well generally you're training with
people that don't know anything.

270
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,190
And I would have trained with
them under the workup, you know,

271
00:16:04,191 --> 00:16:06,200
so they're starting to learn
and they're like, you know,

272
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:09,050
low level white belts or mid level white
belts or even high level wipe butts.

273
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,900
I don't think we, I even had one blue
belt on either one of my deployments.

274
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,970
And the good thing is their team guys,
they're athletic, they're strong,

275
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,780
they're in good shape, they want to
learn. So they learn fast, they're tough.

276
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,020
They're like I said, strong and athletics.
So you're going to get good roles.

277
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,570
The more you teach them,
the better the roles get.

278
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,830
Talking about gay or Nogi we never, I
never traveled with a g for the military,

279
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:31,664
I don't think.

280
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:37,030
And so what I started wearing almost
all the time was Cammie pants and a tee

281
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:41,540
shirt. And what's cool is I did that
when, as soon as I started Jujitsu,

282
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:45,890
I was training with other seals that
were in Cammie pants and a tee shirt

283
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,110
because it didn't make sense to wear
like a Camry top. And so what's cool is,

284
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,390
without even knowing it when no one was
training Nogi I was actually training

285
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,180
Nogi because I did was just training
with guys with tee shirts on it.

286
00:16:59,181 --> 00:17:02,000
Not even wearing pants, but, but
anyway, so yeah, that's what we'd wear.

287
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:06,650
Khaki pants and a tee shirt would, we
occasionally put on OPG gear occasionally,

288
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,820
but, but not, not very often. Uh,

289
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,660
either. The other thing you
got to watch out for with,

290
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,340
with my former organization in the seal
teams is there's guys that would go

291
00:17:19,341 --> 00:17:22,130
nuts, like they didn't want to
tap cause you get major egos.

292
00:17:22,131 --> 00:17:25,570
And so Kaiser could occasionally
goes psycho sometimes when I'd,

293
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,220
when I pit per certain
people against each other,

294
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:32,610
sometimes I'd have to basically officiate
slash be a safety officer to make sure

295
00:17:32,611 --> 00:17:37,040
that no one actually got killed because
they'd be trying to kill each other and

296
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,140
no one wants to tap. And you have to
be like, hey man, you can't, you know,

297
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:43,100
you're about to your arms
about to get broken. Stop.
So he had to do some of that.

298
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,120
Uh, and I'm, I'm, I am a
bit of an instigator. Yeah,

299
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,160
sure.
I mean,

300
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,800
you see it now, I still do it on the
match today, you know, I mean if,

301
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,580
if there's two guys that are
going hard against each other,

302
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,230
but maybe they're not going super
hard. Yeah, yeah. They could go harder,

303
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,930
real easy to escalate that I know.

304
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,500
And so and so I would escalate
matches between guys as well and,

305
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,960
and then, you know, I just roll with
everyone. So yeah. Well the class be like,

306
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,020
we teach the moves just like a regular
Jiu Jitsu class, teach the moves,

307
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,430
go over some stuff and then roll
and that's it. Pretty simple.

308
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:25,320
Good Times. Yeah. I found that if you
can do little drills with yourself,

309
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,950
if you go, if you're a high level guy
and you're going to with the white belt,

310
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:31,280
especially if they're athletic,
what you do is you,

311
00:18:31,281 --> 00:18:35,520
you know how like when you roll with a
guy who was maybe one level give or take

312
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,260
from you, you, um, or let's
say they're one level lower,

313
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:44,430
you'll kind of slowly put yourself
into better or worst situations.

314
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,380
You won't go all out
or nothing. Like, yeah,

315
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,730
but this is kind of counterintuitive to,
if you go with like a,

316
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,610
like a beginner beginner, but their
athletic, what you do is you try to,

317
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:58,790
you think of a finish or make your session
through that as fast as you possibly

318
00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:02,130
can. So if you're like, okay,
I'm going to start on the bottom,

319
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:05,460
we're going to force how many, no.
Well, depends on what you mean.

320
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,300
You don't have to force it. Yeah. But
they're forcing our mock. If you say,

321
00:19:09,301 --> 00:19:10,340
I'm going to finish this an arm lock,

322
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,440
you're gonna have to force him into that
position somewhat. You can set it up.

323
00:19:13,441 --> 00:19:14,340
Sure. Yeah, exactly right.

324
00:19:14,341 --> 00:19:17,760
That's what that's really the drill is
you got to set it up given what he does.

325
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,860
And he could be retreating the
whole time. Sure. It's going to,

326
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,870
so it's going to take longer. It's just,
that's just how did you get to is, but um,

327
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,610
that's the drill in your head rather than,
you know,

328
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,620
let's say an intuitive method to roll
with a white belt is, let's just go light.

329
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:32,401
Let's see what he does.

330
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:35,310
Let them get and get a good position on
you and then I'll work out or whatever,

331
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,230
but no, don't do that and be like, okay,

332
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,740
I'm going to treat this person like
a person that I have to in real life.

333
00:19:40,741 --> 00:19:42,090
So do with,

334
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:45,390
and you choose whatever it a good game
to play actually that is a good game to

335
00:19:45,391 --> 00:19:45,870
play.

336
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:50,100
And then you get real good at that and
going from one thing and then it's also,

337
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:53,070
I don't play that game very often.
I don't know what,

338
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:55,230
there's something that snaps in my
head sometimes when I'm like, okay,

339
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,950
I'm going to just smash this person.
But you know,

340
00:19:58,951 --> 00:20:02,580
sometimes I'll be watching the clock
and when there's 40 seconds left I'll be

341
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:02,871
like,
all right,

342
00:20:02,871 --> 00:20:05,610
I'm going to try and submit this dude in
the next 40 seconds or this is what I'm

343
00:20:05,611 --> 00:20:08,850
going against someone that's good. You
know what I mean? I, that's, I honestly,

344
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:11,310
I do that with you sometimes worry and
you can feel me chilling and I'm all of a

345
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:12,091
sudden I'm like,
oh wait,

346
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:15,990
there's only 30 seconds left and I have
to go super hard to try and get you.

347
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,600
And sometimes I don't give myself enough
time and I said going to have to learn

348
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,380
to get better. Yeah. And
Yeah, me saying that, uh,

349
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,010
agreed. I don't do that in
training because what I heard,

350
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:32,270
my lazy instinct is I always go just
enough better than the person I'm going

351
00:20:33,451 --> 00:20:35,940
against to maintain and
eventually finish them. See,

352
00:20:35,941 --> 00:20:39,630
and that's good because you give the
other guy good training and that's kind of

353
00:20:39,631 --> 00:20:41,010
the point with not,
you don't want to,

354
00:20:41,011 --> 00:20:43,530
if you go and regularly Jitsu
class and you're like, you know,

355
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,680
upper belt mean like purple Brown, black
belt and you go against a white belt,

356
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:48,100
you get paired up with a white belt.

357
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,660
I'm not saying necessarily to do that
all the time because it's kind of,

358
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,110
you kind of, it's a relationship you
have with your training partners.

359
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,920
So if I'm like, okay, every white belt
I go against or have or any beginner,

360
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:01,660
I'm just going to go as hard
as again, it's like, Bro,

361
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:04,410
what are you doing to the
guy? Sure. Good thing.

362
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:09,200
That's why for what you're saying for
blue belts to do that is not good to have.

363
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,210
Who else does that? White belts, they
don't have the scale yet. Green belt,

364
00:21:13,211 --> 00:21:16,570
Brown belt, black belt. That's going
to be, that's going to be like, okay,

365
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:20,200
I'm going to test my efficiency on
making this happen really quickly.

366
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:23,560
Blue Belt against the athletic white belt.
It's going to be,

367
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,090
it's going to be world war seven.
True.

368
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,460
And there's injuries that are waiting
to happen was a purple belt generally is

369
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:31,660
not going to get injured,

370
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:35,110
not going to generally injure someone
from being in a bad position. Blue Belt,

371
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:38,680
white belt, maybe it hasn't.
Bad scenarios. Yeah, and,

372
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:43,600
and so really the point in doing that is
like in a scenario like your situation

373
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:46,690
where you don't have anyone to train
with except for beginners that are all

374
00:21:46,691 --> 00:21:50,330
athletic and hungry. So it's like,
okay, well what do I do? You know,

375
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:54,160
you know what's cool too. He would come
home from deployment better at Jujitsu.

376
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,910
Then when I left for sure that happened
on every appointment. When I came home,

377
00:21:57,911 --> 00:22:01,990
I was better at Jujitsu then when I left,
but not only better than I was,

378
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:06,070
but I was in keeping with the standards
of the guys that were training with Eh.

379
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,080
So,
you know,

380
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:12,090
I'm rolling with Dean before I leave and
I come back and I am now doing better

381
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:17,680
than I was against Dean before I left
where he's been here training the whole

382
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:22,600
time. So that says to me
that is an effective way to
train. You know, you just,

383
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,680
you just, and that, so that's why there's
really no excuse. A lot of people ask,

384
00:22:25,681 --> 00:22:28,180
you know, what should I do? I live four
hours away from the closest gym, man.

385
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:30,640
Get some friends,
put some mats on the ground,

386
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,220
watching youtube and start
training with each other.

387
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,540
And occasionally when you get the chance,
go somewhere to a school once a month,

388
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,920
once every two weeks so
you can learn. Yeah. Yeah.

389
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:44,830
And I think in your
situation is kind of a,

390
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,420
not necessarily unique,

391
00:22:46,421 --> 00:22:50,320
but kind of a specific type of situation
where you have all the fundamentals

392
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:55,280
essentially John. So you know, like
habitual stuff, stuff that you're,

393
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,930
you just automatically do with
certain techniques, which is the,

394
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,590
the correct technique,
you know?

395
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,970
So I think that you'll benefit more
in that way where you can train with

396
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,830
beginners. When I was a
blue belt myself, yeah.

397
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,490
I still got a lot better when
I would be on deployment. Yeah.

398
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:15,070
And when it was a purple belt when I
was a brown belt, yeah, still still,

399
00:23:15,071 --> 00:23:15,940
it's just like a little,

400
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:20,500
just a smaller version of that idea where
if you're a beginner and you're like,

401
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:23,020
okay, I've never taken you to do through,
I'm gonna start on Youtube or whatever.

402
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,310
I don't think you can benefit those
situations. Oh No, you can not as much.

403
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,490
You can't. Yeah. You definitely
not as much, but you can benefit.

404
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,570
I can definitely benefit. You can
definitely benefit. Yeah. It's better.

405
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,840
It's a thousand times better than
not doing anything and not trained.

406
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,970
And if you've got one person that has
that gift of being able to like understand

407
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:43,690
what's happening,

408
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,000
maybe you've got a wrestler in their
burrow going to help you so much for me.

409
00:23:46,001 --> 00:23:48,330
You've got someone that did judo
that's gonna help you so much. Yeah.

410
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,600
But even if you don't, you just
start looking at it and saying, okay,

411
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:52,730
what's happening in this? What's
happening right there? Okay.

412
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:53,720
Try that on and walk on me.

413
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:56,210
And you get some of those good youtube
videos that really break things down.

414
00:23:56,211 --> 00:23:59,120
Well yeah, you can learn a
lot. And I think you can,

415
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,740
cause I didn't have to learn that way,
luckily.

416
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,260
Luckily you got to train with the best
guys in the whole entire world, you know?

417
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:09,620
Hey, you know, to each their own
and then idea actually. Yeah. Um,

418
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,490
actually hotter Gracie, who's, you know,

419
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:18,140
we not even arguably fucking top three,
but all time ever,

420
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,660
he, and he was actually
telling me, he's like,

421
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:25,160
I don't have like a team of world
class guys to train with. He's like,

422
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,940
sometimes they trained with Braulio
sometimes cause he's in, he's in England.

423
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,410
Yeah. So he has like, he's like,

424
00:24:30,411 --> 00:24:33,980
I only trained with my students and who
are good and they give us some training

425
00:24:33,981 --> 00:24:34,551
but they're not,

426
00:24:34,551 --> 00:24:38,630
I don't have world class trading partners
like my opponents do kind of thing and

427
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:46,150
raising, yeah. So men to kind of teach
their own, but all these things, yeah.

428
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,220
Can Be beneficial even even if
they don't necessarily seem like,

429
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:54,680
you know what I think actually this is
leading to is like you get what you make

430
00:24:54,681 --> 00:24:56,350
out of. Right, exactly. Yeah. And there's,

431
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,730
there's people in the UFC that have
done the same thing that came from some

432
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:03,731
random camp and they're training hard
and they go and win the Connor Mcgregor.

433
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,550
He didn't come from, he didn't
come from Greg Jackson. Yeah.

434
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,660
He didn't come from American top
team. He came from, uh, you know,

435
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,160
their school with, with Cavenaugh and
obviously they're doing something right.

436
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,910
But same thing. He didn't have the, the
highest level guys to train against.

437
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,120
He trained, I'm not saying slagging
off their, their training partners,

438
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:26,870
but it's not, it wasn't a known camp when
he came around. Right, right. He, he's so,

439
00:25:26,871 --> 00:25:31,850
he's a guy like that. Uh, Max
Holloway. He's out in Hawaii,

440
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,440
right?
He's training hard,

441
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:37,910
but he's coming out here winning the
UFC championship based on, you know,

442
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:41,120
his training partners.
So I think guys that,

443
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,400
that actually understand what
they need to do. They do it,

444
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:50,450
they get it done. They don't
make any excuses. No excuses.

445
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:56,450
You have at the end of the day, that's
it. Right. Check. Next question.

446
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,050
With life decisions,

447
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,300
is it better to be decisive and take
actions to move forward even if sometimes

448
00:26:05,301 --> 00:26:09,440
those decisions are wrong as opposed to
being paralyzed by indecision and fear,

449
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,660
thus getting maneuvered on by life?

450
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,790
I ask this because I struggle with life
decisions and have trouble committing to

451
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:20,090
one path duty,
eclectic interests.

452
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,340
After listening to your podcast,

453
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:25,790
I'm thinking it's better to be aggressive
and maneuver on the battlefield of

454
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:29,870
life as long as I'm prepared to adapt
rather than sitting around and letting

455
00:26:29,871 --> 00:26:33,230
circumstance dictate my actions.
Well,

456
00:26:33,231 --> 00:26:37,010
it sounds like you kind of answered his
own question there, which is good. Yes,

457
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,340
it is better to be aggressive.
It's better to be decisive.

458
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:43,890
This does not mean burning bridges. And
I think we've talked about this before.

459
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,400
It doesn't mean that you just,
you just say,

460
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:51,390
I'm quitting my job right now because
I'm going to go start a new life as a

461
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,840
whatever your new job is going to be,
right?

462
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,980
I'm going to start a business selling
widgets and I'm just going to go all in

463
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,560
because I'm committed.
Sure. Well, you, you know,

464
00:27:01,561 --> 00:27:03,690
how long has it takes to produce
those widgets and what are, you know,

465
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,560
so there's a lot of issues with that.
You know, it's, there's a way though to,

466
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,910
to mitigate risk on your
decisions. And actually at the, uh,

467
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:16,580
at the camp we were in, up in Maine, there
was a lot of guys that were, you know,

468
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:20,970
listen to the podcast and
one of them really good,

469
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,050
really good guy.

470
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,280
He was talking to me about
his business and the business,

471
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,920
which I'm not going to go into any
details, but he's basically saying, look,

472
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:32,160
I've got this business. It's going
well. I want it to do better.

473
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,530
And I'm kind of weighing this
decision between bringing on,

474
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,161
he says,
no,

475
00:27:39,161 --> 00:27:42,840
I'm going to bring on like six people
to really help expand and grow and all

476
00:27:42,841 --> 00:27:46,740
that stuff. He said, but if I do that
and we have a couple rough, you know,

477
00:27:46,741 --> 00:27:50,850
if we hit some bad luck, I might be
upside down and not be able to handle it.

478
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:54,990
And what I really am scared of is like,
that's not just me,

479
00:27:54,991 --> 00:27:56,010
but it's now it's my family.

480
00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:01,070
I got a wife and I got kids and now I'm
hedging the comfort and safety of my

481
00:28:02,671 --> 00:28:06,570
family so I don't know what
to do. And I said, okay,

482
00:28:06,571 --> 00:28:10,050
well do you have to go all in?
Right?

483
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,530
Do you have to turn around tomorrow and
go, you know what? We're going all in.

484
00:28:13,531 --> 00:28:15,720
I'm going to hire these six people,
we're going to expand.

485
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,210
And hopefully if everything goes right,
we'll do really well.

486
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,320
You don't have to do that. You don't
have to put that much on the table.

487
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,820
Instead I said, I said, well,

488
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:28,440
how many people do you actually
really need right now? And he said,

489
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,380
probably one or two. And I was like, okay,

490
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:37,190
why don't you bring all in one and and
start to see where that goes and be

491
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:39,840
prepared to look for another
person to bring on to.

492
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,860
And then as those two people work out
and you're starting to fill their labor

493
00:28:43,861 --> 00:28:46,740
every day, and they're, they have work
to do because you're expanding the cool,

494
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:48,840
bring on three. And, and guess what?

495
00:28:48,841 --> 00:28:52,470
If you hit a hiccup and things start
going sideways for whatever reason,

496
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,430
that's cool.

497
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,430
You don't have those
additional four people or three
people on board that you're

498
00:28:56,431 --> 00:28:57,990
paying payroll to every month,

499
00:28:57,991 --> 00:29:01,560
which is normally what kills businesses
or one of the common things that kills

500
00:29:01,561 --> 00:29:06,480
businesses. So it's the same. So, so
that's, that's a good example, right?

501
00:29:06,481 --> 00:29:10,230
And he was, he thought to himself and
he looked at me, said, absolutely,

502
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:13,800
I'm going to go do that. And so he's
probably back at his job right now,

503
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:17,040
running his business and probably
hiring a person to start expanding,

504
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,720
not hiring six people and putting all
of his chips on the table where it's a

505
00:29:21,721 --> 00:29:25,500
cool gamble. Let's say the percentage of
winning winning is 70% you're like, yeah,

506
00:29:25,501 --> 00:29:28,590
I'm just going to do it.
There's a 30% chance you lose and lose,

507
00:29:28,591 --> 00:29:30,870
and now your now your family
has no house and no food.

508
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,610
So that's not what we want to do.

509
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,170
So why not just put some of your chips
on the table and you can still win and

510
00:29:37,171 --> 00:29:39,990
make a little bit? You still,
you still improve your position.

511
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,120
So we got to do that with life too.
Like I said,

512
00:29:43,121 --> 00:29:45,700
you don't quit your job to start
building widgets when you don't know what

513
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:48,490
you're doing. You got to, why not just
build the widgets in your spare time?

514
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,120
I start putting those things on the
internet, start seeing how they sell,

515
00:29:52,121 --> 00:29:55,030
start getting a little income from
them, let them grow. And then finally,

516
00:29:55,031 --> 00:29:57,160
when you feel like the
balance start to tip,

517
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,710
maybe there'll be a last minute
jump where you'd be like, okay,

518
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:03,460
now I'm going to go for it. But what
you're committing to is something solid,

519
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:07,000
something tangible, and something
that's making money, right?

520
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,000
We're not jumping in and committing
to something that's an unknown.

521
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,980
We're going to commit some to
something that's known and,

522
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:18,020
and I think it's important to note
that that right there is not a lack of

523
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:24,010
commitment. And this is, you hear these
like you know, people on the interwebs,

524
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,020
there'll be like,
you know why you have made yet?

525
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:30,010
Because you haven't 80 100% that's
why you, if you want to do it,

526
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,940
you got to commit with everything you've
got. Well and so what people think is,

527
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:34,301
okay,

528
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:36,280
well I'm just gonna quit my job because
I'm going to go for it but commit and

529
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:39,070
then I'll be successful. Cause this
guy over here told me if I committed,

530
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,900
I'd be successful.
It's actually not true.

531
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:44,260
You can be 1000% committed to
something and you can still fail.

532
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,900
I got bad news for you.
That's the reality. You know,

533
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:50,350
that's the reality of do you think that
people at blackberry weren't committed

534
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,130
to their game? You know what I mean? You
know, but what happened to blackberry?

535
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:58,780
It's it's you. They were,
they were committed but they
made some bad decisions.

536
00:30:58,781 --> 00:31:01,630
And guess what? Now blackberry is not
really in the game anymore. Well, they,

537
00:31:01,631 --> 00:31:03,280
I think they change games.
I'm not 100% sure,

538
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:08,610
but people think that that because you
didn't quit your job and go all in and

539
00:31:11,651 --> 00:31:13,990
put all your chips on the table.
In fact, you're not committed.

540
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:17,250
And I actually don't agree with that.
And I'll get,

541
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:22,060
here's my example if,
okay.

542
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:27,120
I think that commitment is actually
harder to do when it's a long term

543
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,230
commitment that you're going,
okay, you know what, I'm gonna,

544
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,101
I'm gonna stay at my job,

545
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:35,050
but I'm gonna work three hours
a day on this other thing.

546
00:31:35,051 --> 00:31:37,430
I'm going to be manufactured with maybe
making my widgets three hours a day.

547
00:31:37,431 --> 00:31:39,190
And when I get home at
10 o'clock at night,

548
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,130
I'm going to go until one o'clock
in the morning making my widgets.

549
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:45,580
That's commitment.
It's actually smart commitment.

550
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:49,540
It actually in some ways takes more
commitment to do that than it does just to

551
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,910
quit your job and say, I'm all
in. Because now you're holding,

552
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:53,530
you're balancing all these
different things you're carrying,

553
00:31:53,531 --> 00:31:56,830
you're shouldering more of a burden.
So that actually takes more commitment.

554
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:01,000
The problem is that people,
they, they get weak.

555
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,680
And after the fourth night of making
widgets at 10 o'clock at night, they go,

556
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,800
yeah, I'm gonna, I'm good.
It's cool to have a job. I
have a job. And so that's week.

557
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:13,870
I, you know, an example would
be what if you could get in

558
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:20,380
excellent physical
condition in three hours,

559
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:25,710
but it was just like the hardest three
hours that you could imagine thinking

560
00:32:27,001 --> 00:32:32,001
about that and your body would transform
from whatever crap condition you're in

561
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:38,641
right now into a specimen and it's
going to take three hours of just,

562
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,580
yeah. How many more people
would be an amazing condition?

563
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:49,670
I don't know. I think a ton more because
committing for three hours to something,

564
00:32:49,671 --> 00:32:52,250
even if it was going to be super bad,
people would be able to do it.

565
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:57,110
What takes more commitment and the reason
everyone's not walking around like a

566
00:32:57,111 --> 00:33:00,350
perfect specimen is because
it doesn't take three hours.

567
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,840
It doesn't take three weeks.
It doesn't take three months.

568
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,960
It takes a daily grind that goes on for
years that you have to hold the line on,

569
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:12,830
on the way you eat,
on the way you exercise on your life.

570
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:16,310
And that takes real commitment.
Yes.

571
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,550
So it isn't a lack of commitment.
It's planning.

572
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,860
It isn't a lack of commitment.

573
00:33:21,861 --> 00:33:26,780
It is mitigating risk and don't confuse.
Again,

574
00:33:26,781 --> 00:33:31,310
I think that the person that commits to
something and still maintains this other

575
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:35,120
income stream, for example, that
person is at least as committed,

576
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:38,030
if not more committed than the
person says, you know what? Screw it.

577
00:33:38,031 --> 00:33:40,790
I'm going all in over here. I'm forgetting
about, you know, quitting my job.

578
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:45,520
But that's not a smart move and it takes
more. That's actually an easier, well,

579
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:49,010
that's my point. It's easier in
many ways to go, you know what?

580
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,940
I'm quitting his day job. I'm quitting my
nine to five. I'm sick of that cubicle.

581
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,640
I'm sick of that construction site.
I'm just going all in over here.

582
00:33:55,850 --> 00:34:00,230
That is an easier move.
That takes less commitment than saying,

583
00:34:00,231 --> 00:34:05,231
I'm going to shoulder the
burden of working 15 1820
hours a day for the next two

584
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:12,170
years until I can get this thing stood up
enough to where I can execute it. Yeah.

585
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:16,010
Yes. It's almost like people were
conflating the commitment. You know?

586
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:21,011
It's like the almost people want to
want to do a big show of commitment by

587
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:24,780
quitting their job, but it's more
of just a show of commitment.

588
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:27,140
You're committed or
you're not kind of thing.

589
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:32,060
And then so a lot of times with these
big shows of commitment comes just an

590
00:34:32,061 --> 00:34:35,870
immense amount of stupidity,
you know? Yeah, yeah. Meanwhile,

591
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:38,740
you can either commit or don't
commit, you know? Yeah, sure.

592
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:42,830
If you don't quit your job and you make
widgets and you don't commit, sure.

593
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:46,580
It's like, all right, you got, you can
facilitate your non commitment. Yeah.

594
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,620
I dig here.
Do your real job,

595
00:34:48,621 --> 00:34:53,440
your nine to five job as an enabler to
you not committing. Yeah. Fully. Yeah.

596
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:57,970
But by no means is that
you know, no proof. Yeah.

597
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:02,090
And it's important to
note that don't confuse,

598
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,390
and this is another mistake that people
make mistakes on either ends of the

599
00:35:05,391 --> 00:35:05,900
spectrum.

600
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,900
The other one is don't confuse planning
and mitigating risk with not taking

601
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:13,310
action,
because that can happen to,

602
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,450
you have to make things happen every
single day. That's what you have to do.

603
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,720
If you don't take action.
If you don't move,

604
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,330
which is what this guy's asking about,
then yeah,

605
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,920
you're paralyzed and you're
never going to get anywhere.

606
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,140
All you have to do is
chip away at that thing.

607
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,350
You got to make a little bit of movement
every day. You want to write a book,

608
00:35:30,351 --> 00:35:32,510
and this is something I'm familiar
with now, cause I'm writing books.

609
00:35:32,511 --> 00:35:35,630
I'm writing another book right
now and you know what I gotta do?

610
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,010
I gotta chip away at that thing every day,
every day,

611
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:43,140
every day. There's your commitment,
thousand words a day, 45 minutes,

612
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,960
maybe an hour. That's what
it takes. And guess what?

613
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:48,840
If I can't give that hour for
whatever reason, guess what?

614
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:52,680
I'm going to get to 20 minutes.
I'm going to get 30 minutes,

615
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,420
I'm going to get
something to get in there.

616
00:35:54,421 --> 00:35:58,230
I'm going to do work because I'm going
to be close to my goal than it was. Yeah.

617
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,310
That's the way it is. Yeah, man. And
I think you got to see that live.

618
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,150
Didn't your honor?
It was my honor.

619
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:12,660
That's, uh, but that's where it happens.
Where else is it going to happen? Right.

620
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,670
Yeah. We were flying back from Maine.
I was, you know, echoes cruising. Good.

621
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:20,790
Yeah. I think I fell asleep a couple of
times. Yeah. You were kind of in and out,

622
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,690
but I wasn't, I was hammering, I was,

623
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:26,760
I was doing what I have to do because
if I don't do it, then when's that?

624
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,400
When I'm going to get that hour. That was,
that was four hours I had right there.

625
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,980
Flight. Technically five. Yeah.

626
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,770
Couldn't get my computer out for
the first little bit. Oh yeah.

627
00:36:34,771 --> 00:36:38,160
They didn't let you, so
whatever. All good. Yeah.

628
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:41,030
It was kind of at time till it's peeking
over your shoulder, like reading all,

629
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,050
let's talk. Go. Right. And
then they see a, what was it?

630
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:50,220
I felt the named Kenny Williamson
in there. Goes writing right now.

631
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,050
Look to this good man composed.
Yeah,

632
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,030
I think that all that sounds
like kind of obvious. You know,

633
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:01,440
when you're saying it, I'm
like, yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. Got It. Or, you know,

634
00:37:01,441 --> 00:37:03,990
or at least the part where it's like,
it's a daily thing.

635
00:37:03,991 --> 00:37:08,340
Like you got to have a progress, you
know, like you got to take that step,

636
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:12,210
you know, do, it sounds obvious,
but man, how many times,

637
00:37:12,211 --> 00:37:16,430
and I didn't know this is like my
friends and you know, whatever, uh,

638
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:20,400
you go on, I don't know,
online or whatever, and you
see people complaining about,

639
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:25,350
you know, stuff never happens
for me. You know, FML,

640
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:29,040
FML means yes, stuff never
happens to you. That's right.

641
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,780
And stuff never happens for you.
That's right.

642
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:35,790
That is life doesn't happen for you in
life. You got to go and make it. You know,

643
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:38,610
I've explained to my kids,
you want to make money,

644
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,850
you have to take that money from someone
else. You have to take it from them.

645
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:44,710
Then people aren't just gonna
walk up and give you money. Right.

646
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,950
That doesn't happen.
That's never happened to me in my life.

647
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,720
No one has ever walked up
and given me money. I mean,

648
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,380
you got to take that money that
they got to give it to you,

649
00:37:52,381 --> 00:37:56,220
that you've got to make them, you
got to take it from them. Yeah.

650
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,480
They want that money to,

651
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,810
so what are you going to give them that's
going to allow you to take it from him?

652
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:05,370
Yeah, that, that so yeah. Guess what?
Nothing's, nothing happens for you.

653
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,800
That's right. Nothing does happen
for you. You have to make it happen.

654
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,520
That's the default aggressive mindset
that you are going to make things happen.

655
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,250
I'm not gonna sit around and wait for
things to happen and it's not going to

656
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:18,900
happen. Yeah. It's not
going to happen. Oh,

657
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:19,501
well guess what?

658
00:38:19,501 --> 00:38:23,240
I read a story about this such and such
a person and they just walked into this,

659
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:23,970
you know,

660
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:28,320
agency and they thought they looked did
a really good job and now they're famous.

661
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,670
Okay. That's great. Base your life on
that percentage chance of happening.

662
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,690
It's not happening. Yeah. I actually, I
look at that and just think the match,

663
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,710
the chances of anything like
that happened to me or zero,

664
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,110
nothing good is going to
happen to me like that,

665
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:44,370
that I'm just going to get a good deal.
Like that's not happening. Zero. Yeah,

666
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,200
so if, if you're going to get it, you're
going to have to make it happen. Yeah.

667
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,950
Next question. You're saying that should
be the red flag right there then. Right.

668
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,420
Basically for the, for someone
who's like nothing, you know,

669
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:59,560
when am I going to get my big break or,
or you know,

670
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,560
nothing happens for me kind of thing.
That should be the red flag, right?

671
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,220
When it's like, yeah. Yeah.

672
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:08,080
Seems you're talking about
the fact that you're not,

673
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,210
that things aren't coming
to you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

674
00:39:10,211 --> 00:39:14,110
That should be a real big red flag.
Nothing is going to come to you.

675
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,750
Not Happening,
not happening.

676
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:20,740
You got to go and make things happen
and once you have that attitude,

677
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:23,590
I'll tell you what, it's a game
changer. It's a game changer.

678
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,320
Once you realize that that book
that's so good, that's in your head,

679
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:29,740
it's not going to write itself. Once
you realize that widget that you have,

680
00:39:29,741 --> 00:39:34,120
this plan for isn't going to build
itself, then you'll realize like, okay,

681
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:37,600
I'm going to have to make these things
happen, and even then, guess what?

682
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:40,300
You can make a widget that no one wants
to buy and you can write a book that no

683
00:39:40,301 --> 00:39:44,140
one wants to know, wants to read,
and if you're not okay with that,

684
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,290
which is another thing that
happens, people say, well, you know,

685
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:50,920
no one will like it. Okay,
well if that's what you think,

686
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:53,560
well then don't even ride it unless
you want to write it for yourself.

687
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:57,760
Then write it for yourself and cool.
Be be proud, be stoked to be happy.

688
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,210
It's interesting. Let's say a
book book, right? For example,

689
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:06,370
this kind of reminds me of where you know
how, let's say, I don't know me, I'm a,

690
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,850
let's say, Oh, I'm a, I'm a
pretty good writer. In fact,
I even wrote a book before,

691
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,330
whatever. And then my friend
on Instagram, Facebook,

692
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:18,040
whatever, someone, my neighbor,
whatever, they write a book and they,

693
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,740
they release it and then they write
another one and May, let's say,

694
00:40:20,741 --> 00:40:23,500
it's not even really that good,
but it's out there. They're like,

695
00:40:23,501 --> 00:40:26,380
look at my new book. And you know, they
got people support. Oh, that's awesome.

696
00:40:26,381 --> 00:40:28,210
You wrote a book and,
and I'm meanwhile,

697
00:40:28,211 --> 00:40:30,330
I'm like kind of sour grapes a
little bit. I'm like, should I am?

698
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,350
I'm a better writer then in that person.
Meanwhile, I didn't write any more.

699
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:37,690
I'm over here. Yeah, I wrote back
in the day, long time ago, you know?

700
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:45,790
But you know, I'm in it. I'm
saying I'm in that arena, you know,

701
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:47,380
and I'm kind of in my mind hating on this.

702
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,630
There's people that hate on him that never
even wrote a book in the first place.

703
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,160
Yeah. Oh Man, I'm a better
writer. I'm a better film guy.

704
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,600
I'm a better writer, I'm a
better fighter. Whatever.

705
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,200
They had all kinds of people doing that.

706
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:03,040
All kinds of people that will just
be saying, Oh, you know, I, I,

707
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:08,140
I was a better whatever.
Fighter, Jujitsu player,

708
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:12,280
a carpenter, a, whatever,
you name it. Yeah. Meanwhile,

709
00:41:12,281 --> 00:41:16,990
taking no action software engineer.
I could have done that.

710
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,540
Why didn't you? Yeah, exactly
right. I'll tell you why.

711
00:41:19,541 --> 00:41:23,650
Because you weren't committed. Yes. And
the commitment that we're talking about,

712
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:28,500
is it night. Yeah. At night or early,

713
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,680
early in the morning or in the middle of
the day, whatever it, how you said like,

714
00:41:32,681 --> 00:41:33,350
you're,

715
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:37,880
you're not doing these
enormous shows of commitment.

716
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,950
Like either you're committed or
you're not, and if you're committed,

717
00:41:39,951 --> 00:41:43,580
it's going to show itself by your
action. You know, allows people, again,

718
00:41:43,581 --> 00:41:48,581
back to the guy who's like hating on his
neighbor doing quote unquote mediocre

719
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:52,140
work. Like, oh, that's John, that's not
that good hitting on it. You know what?

720
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:56,450
This just made me think of this.
Sometimes you'd meet a guy that was say,

721
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:00,160
I'm going to seal training and,

722
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:05,280
and they'd kind of be brag about it and
you could see in their eyes that that

723
00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:09,190
right there was good enough for them.
Oh be like,

724
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,650
I'm going to seal seal team training.
Yeah.

725
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,670
No one had caused a seal team training,

726
00:42:13,671 --> 00:42:17,510
but that's the kind of person cause
they just want to write. And you, I,

727
00:42:17,511 --> 00:42:19,730
I'd hear guy, you know,
guys saying that, yeah,

728
00:42:19,731 --> 00:42:24,731
I'm going to seal training the guys that
generally have a better chance or guys

729
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:27,590
that, you know, you say, oh, what are
you doing in the navy? And they say, Oh,

730
00:42:27,591 --> 00:42:31,940
you know, I'm um, you know, just got
done with a school and I'm starting, uh,

731
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:35,710
hoping to go to seal training. You know,
the, the, you have to pry it out of him.

732
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:38,630
That guy's a better chance.
The guy that's already bragging,

733
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:43,160
basically indirectly bragging because
he's implying that he's going to make it.

734
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:46,340
Those guys going to have a
little bit more of a rough five.

735
00:42:46,341 --> 00:42:49,520
Now this doesn't mean they're not, this
doesn't mean don't be confident. Yeah.

736
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:54,530
But that's what I'm saying is some
people that are like, I'm going for it.

737
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,930
They're happy with just saying,
I'm committed.

738
00:42:56,931 --> 00:42:58,250
I quit my job and this
is one way to do it.

739
00:42:58,251 --> 00:43:00,710
They're happy to let everyone know that.
Yes.

740
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:05,540
But what they're not happy to do is grind.
That's what they're not happy to do.

741
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:09,140
And that's where, that's where you,
that's where you make your money, right.

742
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:13,670
Or where you make your goods are
where you become successful. Yeah,

743
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:17,570
there was, it is, it doesn't matter,

744
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:22,010
but alluding to somebody and they
were talking about, um, like commit,

745
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:28,070
like people have goals.
I want to be a singer or whatever.

746
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,830
I want to be a CEO. I was
wondering, I want to be a CEO

747
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:36,290
or you can form an LLC today and you
can be become the CEO. Exactly. Right.

748
00:43:36,291 --> 00:43:39,460
So that's kind of part of the
point right there. It's like, okay,

749
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,100
you want to be a feel because you
see all this cool stuff on wherever,

750
00:43:43,101 --> 00:43:44,000
above being a CEO.

751
00:43:44,001 --> 00:43:48,020
But really what you're pursuing
isn't necessarily being the it is,

752
00:43:48,021 --> 00:43:49,790
but what you're pursuing,

753
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:53,420
where you're going to end up and where
you're going to find success as a CEO,

754
00:43:53,421 --> 00:43:57,760
if you're pursuing that day to
day of being a CEO, it's like, oh,

755
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:01,780
I said this before and it's, it's
on the surface, it's lame, but it's,

756
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:06,620
it's actually really accurate.
Like, if you want to be a gangster,

757
00:44:06,621 --> 00:44:09,500
you have to do gangster stuff every day.

758
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,950
It's not just like posing with your guns.
It's like you got to kind of,

759
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:17,750
you gotta put in that work kind of thing,
you know? So if you're going to be like,

760
00:44:17,751 --> 00:44:22,660
you can't just be Jocko and start a
podcast and just in, in, you know,

761
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:25,520
put out a book and that's it,
and start collecting money.

762
00:44:25,521 --> 00:44:28,670
It's not like that you gotta you
gotta go through to, you know,

763
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:32,250
however old you are,
many hears other steps involved.

764
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:36,340
Exactly right this day. And I
used to joke about, uh, you know,

765
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,690
cause when we started Ashkelon Front
obviously, which is me and him,

766
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:45,590
and we'd see some other guy out there
to be a CEO of something and we'd be

767
00:44:47,341 --> 00:44:48,660
saying, well, that guy, a CEO of,

768
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,850
and you look at their company
and the company has them,

769
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:55,110
the only one person or
three people it, bro, you're

770
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:02,520
on the CEO. Hey, I'm the CEO of Jocko
podcast. The whole, it's just you and me.

771
00:45:02,521 --> 00:45:06,270
There's no CEO going on here.
Yeah. We're cruising too hard.

772
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:11,040
Yeah, yeah. That deal.

773
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:14,880
You've got to focus on the right things
as opposed to the wrong thing. Check.

774
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:20,250
Next question.
Jocko.

775
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:22,950
I coach high school football,

776
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,610
which should I do with the star athlete
who segregates himself and won't

777
00:45:26,611 --> 00:45:31,400
participate in hard drills or it won't
participate hard in drills. Yeah.

778
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,521
Now this one,

779
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:36,990
I actually thankfully remembered that I
said I would do this because when I got

780
00:45:36,991 --> 00:45:37,201
this,

781
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:42,201
this is a Twitter question and I responded
to this Twitter question in one word.

782
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:46,920
So you know, he says, I got this guy, Star
athlete, he won't participate in drills.

783
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:47,850
What should I do with them?

784
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,380
I responded in one word
bench thought that so,

785
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,380
so of course, you know, then people
start saying, well you know it's, and,

786
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,960
and I was like, yeah, I know. We're on
Twitter, right? We're on Twitter. Uh,

787
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,450
there's more to it than what's happening.

788
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:08,480
I just answered 798 questions and this
was 799 so I'm not going to go into full

789
00:46:10,231 --> 00:46:13,020
detail. But then as people were kind
of chime in and I was like, okay, I'll,

790
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:18,021
I'll answer this on the podcast so
we can go into it a little bit more.

791
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,970
Because yes, your coach, your leader,

792
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,420
and obviously I talk
about this all the time,

793
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:29,100
leadership is a nuance thing.
It takes balance,

794
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:34,170
it takes maneuvering, it takes
chess playing, it takes mental,

795
00:46:34,171 --> 00:46:35,610
Jujitsu, it takes all those things, right?

796
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:39,960
So the obvious answer of just like bench,
that's my meat head answer.

797
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:44,460
And fundamentally we'll get to it,
but,

798
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,370
and fundamentally that may be the result,

799
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,300
but let's dive into it a little bit
more. Who's The kid? What's his deal?

800
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:55,170
What's his background? What's his
attitude? Where's he coming from?

801
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:59,550
What's his family like life?
Or what's his family life like?

802
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,380
What is,
what's his past performance?

803
00:47:04,381 --> 00:47:06,030
What's his record?
What year is he in school?

804
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,040
I mean there's all kinds of
things we need to know, right?

805
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,780
So now once we've sort of figured out
what he liked now that any one of those

806
00:47:12,781 --> 00:47:15,450
things,
any one of those variables is going to,

807
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,700
is going to change our course
of action a little bit.

808
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:22,060
Because being a leader doesn't mean you
get to follow a cookie cutter results or

809
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:24,220
quick cookie cutter solutions to things,
right?

810
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:27,030
You're dealing with human beings and
every single human being is different.

811
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:31,120
And every single human being has a
little to them that you cannot predict.

812
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:35,290
So we're dealing with a kid.
Guess what? A 16 year old boy,

813
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,930
that kid is even more unpredictable
and even more crazy than most, right?

814
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:43,630
Cause he's got testosterone
flowing through his system.
He's chasing girls, he's,

815
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:46,390
he's just going crazy.
He's not secure with himself yet.

816
00:47:46,391 --> 00:47:49,450
He's got zits on his face. He's,
you know, he's got things going on,

817
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:53,500
he's got issues. And so this kid is crazy
and we're trying to deal with them. Now.

818
00:47:53,501 --> 00:47:54,650
Most kids can get,
you know,

819
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:57,100
they get through that and they're still
participating in the team. This gets not,

820
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:00,040
so one of the first
things I always say this,

821
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:02,470
you got somebody that's not stepping up
into leadership position or they're not

822
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:06,430
wandering. You put them in charge of
it. Hmm. You know, you say, Hey, echo,

823
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:09,410
I want you to run this drill.
I think the way up,

824
00:48:09,411 --> 00:48:10,480
I'm watching you perform on the field,

825
00:48:10,481 --> 00:48:12,460
but I think you could really
lead this drill. Well,

826
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,810
I want you to lead this drill and show
these guys what's up, right? Oh, so,

827
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:19,090
so you know what I mean? Like you
got a little fired up face on your,

828
00:48:19,091 --> 00:48:23,320
you're just there. So that might take his
attitude. And now instead of me saying,

829
00:48:23,321 --> 00:48:26,230
Hey Echo, you've got to do
this drill like everyone else.

830
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,300
I already know that you
don't want to do that.

831
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:32,260
So I'm elevating you a little bit and
your ego, a little push, a little massage,

832
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:35,260
and maybe you feel good about that
now. And I say, Hey, you know,

833
00:48:35,261 --> 00:48:37,630
you can run this drill faster than
anyone else. I want you to lead it.

834
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:41,050
I want you to show them how to do it. I
want you to make our team better. Boom.

835
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,970
All of a sudden you're getting
a little fired up. So that's,

836
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:47,350
that's one solution type,
right?

837
00:48:47,351 --> 00:48:50,500
I'm just getting kind of a broad solution
types on. Another solution type is, is,

838
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:53,350
and this is real easy,
real easy,

839
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:57,490
is when you're talking to someone that
you want to improve their performance,

840
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,350
you don't go to them and say, Hey, uh,

841
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,500
you need to get better because you're
just right now you're letting the whole

842
00:49:05,501 --> 00:49:08,710
team down, right? And you're
just, you think you're all good.

843
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:10,510
You think you're so good
that you don't need to coach.

844
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:13,870
You don't need to run drills with the
team. You need to run drills to the team.

845
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:19,510
Now your attitude is what are you talking
about? So instead of saying that I,

846
00:49:19,511 --> 00:49:23,530
again, I'm going to eagle you up
a little bit and be say, Hey man,

847
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:24,851
I'm going to talk to you.

848
00:49:24,851 --> 00:49:29,440
I've got to talk to you because I see so
much potential with you, with your game.

849
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,630
I see your athletic ability and I see
the way that the other guys on the team

850
00:49:34,631 --> 00:49:38,630
look at you. You might not sense it.
They look up to you. You're a leader.

851
00:49:38,631 --> 00:49:39,890
Whether you want to be a leader or not.

852
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:45,370
And the potential that you have in is
as an athlete is not going to come to

853
00:49:45,711 --> 00:49:46,800
fruition on,

854
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:51,950
unless you at least get some of
your potential as a leader in line.

855
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,150
So the reason I want you to run these
drills isn't to make you better.

856
00:49:56,151 --> 00:49:59,390
I already know you're good.
I already know you're good at the drills.

857
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:02,600
The reason I want you to run these drills,
Chi wants you to be even better.

858
00:50:02,601 --> 00:50:03,650
I want you to reach your potential.

859
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:06,380
And by the way you help and run these
drills is going to make the team better.

860
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,720
And the better the team does,
the better you're going to do.

861
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:10,610
The more scouts we're going
to here looking at you.

862
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:14,020
So there's that,

863
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:18,400
and obviously I'm gonna explain to him
why the drills are important for him and

864
00:50:18,401 --> 00:50:22,090
for the team and for AML and the team
together for everyone to reach their

865
00:50:22,091 --> 00:50:26,020
potential. So those
were, those are good too.

866
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,540
And I guess overall,

867
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:32,390
broadly what I'd be doing this
whole time is talking to the person,

868
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:35,060
talking to the individual,
trying to figure out

869
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,320
what his reasons were for not
wanting to participate in the drills.

870
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:45,040
And then countering those reasons
with logical answers and you know,

871
00:50:47,631 --> 00:50:48,111
saying,
Hey,

872
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:51,560
here's why it's important and explaining
it to them and then eventually you're

873
00:50:51,561 --> 00:50:55,250
going to get to a point where my
coaching, my explaining, my maneuvering,

874
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:56,660
my mental Jujitsu,

875
00:50:56,870 --> 00:51:00,200
none of it's worked and he's still
telling me I'm not running the drills.

876
00:51:00,201 --> 00:51:02,800
I don't need to. Cool. Ben,

877
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:07,820
next question. You know what I mean? Well
you played ball. What do you think? Yeah,

878
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:11,960
cause I didn't play football.
Yeah, no, that's exactly
right. I would, I would think,

879
00:51:11,961 --> 00:51:15,260
and I'm trying to put myself in the
mindset back when I was in high school,

880
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:19,700
I remember going into my senior year,
so you have,

881
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:21,710
oh we had some kind of summer training,

882
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:26,520
so it was really like high school summer
training. That was for fall. Okay.

883
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,530
Um, and that was like a camp
situation, but no summer training,

884
00:51:30,531 --> 00:51:33,530
which was like after spring and
stuff in it. And what they'd call it,

885
00:51:33,531 --> 00:51:37,430
they call it technique sessions.
And all it was was like, you know,

886
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:40,820
I played in high school was
kind of like a slap back,

887
00:51:40,821 --> 00:51:44,860
which is a hybrid running back
wide receiver type. And um,

888
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,680
so the technique sessions were just
kind of passing drills and you know,

889
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:53,570
just hand stuff and maybe
even some footwork. But it
was kind of fun. It was just,

890
00:51:53,571 --> 00:51:53,781
you know,

891
00:51:53,781 --> 00:51:57,050
the quarterback who was there and the
receivers in the Ryan Beck catch passes,

892
00:51:57,051 --> 00:52:01,430
run routes and stuff and you know, for
like, I dunno, 45 minutes, hour and um,

893
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:04,850
so I remember going into my senior
year and they're talking about, yeah,

894
00:52:04,851 --> 00:52:07,070
technique sessions this
year, whatever, whatever.

895
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,980
And I remember I was just talking to
jade, my brother, and I was like, yeah,

896
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:12,680
technique sessions.
It's the kind where if you don't go,

897
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:15,860
you don't get in big trouble or nothing.
It's just strongly encouraged, you know,

898
00:52:15,861 --> 00:52:18,290
that kind of stuff. And I'm like,
yeah, I'm not going to those kind of,

899
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:21,010
cause that was real.
I had done it with a man.

900
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,680
I done well as a junior and I knew that
now as a senior I'm really going to do

901
00:52:24,681 --> 00:52:27,020
well, whatever, whatever. That's,
that was my little thought.

902
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:28,940
I don't need to go to those. So
I was like, I was like, yeah,

903
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:31,540
I'm not going into those with
this kind of tone, that line.

904
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,850
That's for people who are trying
to train to get better. Me,

905
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:39,440
I'm already dope kind of thing.
You know? And Jay goes, he goes,

906
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:43,340
oh yeah, like we're super sarcastic, like
almost offended. He was like, Oh yeah,

907
00:52:43,341 --> 00:52:46,730
cause you don't need that,
huh? And then he said, yeah,

908
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:48,340
because you're just so
much better than everyone.

909
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:53,480
Actually I think he said both of those and
I was like, Bro, it hit me really hard.

910
00:52:53,481 --> 00:52:57,980
I was like, Dang, he's
right. Even if even if like,

911
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:00,330
even if I really believe which it,

912
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,920
it's dumb to believe that I
won't benefit from that training.

913
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:07,880
Even if it's like I'm just
like, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm
better than you. My whole team,

914
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:11,390
by the way, the team sport, we all
work together to win this stuff.

915
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:15,950
All you guys, I'm better than all you
guys. Yeah. That's the feeling I had.

916
00:53:15,951 --> 00:53:19,220
He hit me real hard. I was like sure
I didn't miss any of them. Now I'm,

917
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:23,240
and I'm committed to. So there
was that. Um, so in that,

918
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:27,030
in that mindset, right. Going in,
cause that's probably what it is. Yeah.

919
00:53:27,031 --> 00:53:27,864
It might be just that.

920
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,230
And it makes sense like we're in your
mind if you don't get it brought to your

921
00:53:31,231 --> 00:53:33,450
attention, like that's really what it
is. I don't need to do these drills.

922
00:53:33,451 --> 00:53:35,040
I'm scoring touchdowns every single game.

923
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:39,030
Why am I doing these drills that all
these non touchdown scoring people are

924
00:53:39,031 --> 00:53:42,270
doing, you know, just put me
in when it's time to score,

925
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,950
touch that kind of an attitude,
you know,

926
00:53:43,951 --> 00:53:47,310
that's probably what it is or making
tackles or whatever the position is.

927
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:50,910
I Dunno. Um, so just like how you said,

928
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:57,120
make him kind of in charge of it, kind
of like this guy, what's his name is Jim.

929
00:53:57,230 --> 00:54:00,210
I know Jim, you know,

930
00:54:00,211 --> 00:54:03,540
take these guys and show them how it's
done kind of thing in practice because

931
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:04,970
practices, cause yeah, imagine,

932
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:06,650
imagine if you say I'm not
going to go to this thing.

933
00:54:06,651 --> 00:54:10,070
And the coach came up and he
said, hey echo are you, you know,

934
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:13,230
you missed your practices and you're like,
yeah, you know. And he was like, hey man,

935
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,860
I need you to set the example and
really show these guys how it's done and

936
00:54:16,861 --> 00:54:18,690
you're not even showing up.
Yeah.

937
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:23,790
Even in mate me back in those days,

938
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:27,960
if you would have left out that you
didn't show up part, leave that part out.

939
00:54:27,961 --> 00:54:31,520
That would have compelled me way more.
Like if you're like you man, you're,

940
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:34,770
you're over here as a junior killing
it and now it's about to be your senior

941
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:38,400
year. You show you guys how it's
done. I'd be like no. Yeah. You know,

942
00:54:38,401 --> 00:54:41,340
cause it's like feeding the wheel
kind of thing and boom out. Oh yeah.

943
00:54:41,341 --> 00:54:46,170
Big Time Sheet. Take charge
in Pop Warner football,

944
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,550
which is, you know, younger guys
in I played for the Koloa Rams.

945
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,720
Yeah. Sound ruthless. They
are still are by the way. Um,

946
00:54:55,260 --> 00:55:00,260
and so my coach's name is coach
Scovel and he had this kind of,

947
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,230
it's kind of like a policy kind of the
thing where when you do jumping jacks,

948
00:55:04,231 --> 00:55:09,180
when you do drills like, um, they call
them gras drills, it's just like, oh,

949
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:10,200
you do this stuff,
you role,

950
00:55:10,201 --> 00:55:14,970
you do these things and while you do this
in practice, and even before the game,

951
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,730
when you're warming up, you yell
as loud as you can. That's it.

952
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:20,940
You yell a little kids just yelling,
getting that stuff for his reasons.

953
00:55:20,941 --> 00:55:23,440
And it worked. Man.
We're, we're good. And um,

954
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:27,510
so what I would do is I
would try to be the dude,

955
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:31,770
like yell as loud as I possibly can to
be the loudest guy during the entire,

956
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:35,460
whatever you're doing, you're just
yelling the entire time. The drills. Yeah.

957
00:55:35,461 --> 00:55:38,580
When it's your turn, not, not
if you're standing, you know,
stand up in line. Got It.

958
00:55:38,581 --> 00:55:43,490
And then the front. Yeah. So the
coach stands in front of three guys,

959
00:55:43,491 --> 00:55:45,440
three lines, and the guys in
the front are doing the drills.

960
00:55:45,441 --> 00:55:49,560
So he holds the ball and you go, oh, and
you just basically shuffle your feet.

961
00:55:49,561 --> 00:55:52,170
And he goes like that. Then you turn and
then you come back and he goes this way,

962
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:55,430
turn. And then he goes down. Then
you basically sprawl, you know, boom,

963
00:55:55,431 --> 00:55:57,870
stand back a bit, you know, and
then he goes, okay, like that.

964
00:55:57,871 --> 00:56:01,500
And then the three guys run. Now it's the
next guys. You see what I'm saying? So,

965
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:06,020
and when you're running, you gotta
yell too. So that's been good.

966
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:09,540
Cardiovascular work. Yeah. To be
yelling, cause you can't bring as much.

967
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:13,980
What it does is gets you in the habit
of just going heart, heart, every play,

968
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,480
you know? And when you're
done, you don't have to yell.

969
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:19,050
You're cruising your esteem, getting rid.
And when one is go time, it's go time.

970
00:56:19,051 --> 00:56:23,560
And habitually. That's how it was man. It
was, it really worked. And um, so anyway,

971
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:24,460
when

972
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:28,690
I would yell is that in the coach would
do this to a lot of kids when UDL super

973
00:56:28,691 --> 00:56:29,171
loud,
you know,

974
00:56:29,171 --> 00:56:32,230
you can just see here that guy yelling
above everybody would give that guy

975
00:56:32,231 --> 00:56:35,290
attention. Well, this guy who's
getting a hot, yeah, look at this,

976
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:39,810
it lose this guy and now the next guy,
he's going to try to out yell that guy,

977
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:42,790
go harder, go harder. So it's
that same idea, you know,

978
00:56:42,791 --> 00:56:46,630
you give that guy props for working hard
or showing everybody how it's done kind

979
00:56:46,631 --> 00:56:48,010
of thing.
And it's like Ben,

980
00:56:48,011 --> 00:56:51,010
who's going to keep that shit up and
everyone's going to want it. In fact,

981
00:56:51,011 --> 00:56:54,970
Jeff did me like that this week in
training. So I go in and desks like, okay,

982
00:56:55,210 --> 00:57:00,130
after training is like everybody, you
know, Glover, yeah, he um, you know,

983
00:57:00,131 --> 00:57:03,300
you do some pushups or like he'll make
you do some pushups or whatever. And I'm,

984
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:05,920
he's like, okay, do the
triangle drill. You know, when
you're, you're on your back,

985
00:57:05,921 --> 00:57:08,050
you rock back, you do a
triangle, you rock back again,

986
00:57:08,051 --> 00:57:12,580
go to triangle the other side. So, oh, all
levels are in their beginnings as well.

987
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,640
And I'm, so I'm doing it and he goes, oh,
everybody in the middle of, he goes, stop,

988
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:20,500
watch. I'll echo does it. And I'm like,
if I didn't see what was going on here,

989
00:57:20,501 --> 00:57:25,030
I would feel really empowered to
show it for now. And, and you know,

990
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:28,390
so he successfully pulled that off
as far as the feeling in my head.

991
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:33,280
Two grown adult fitness. Were you doing
them? Yeah, it was doing it with everybody

992
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,840
when he pauses the whole class and said,
watch how he does it, you know, so it's,

993
00:57:37,841 --> 00:57:39,610
it's the exact same concept up your game.

994
00:57:39,611 --> 00:57:44,200
A little bit technique
should every bloody yeah, no,

995
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,600
it's good man.
That works then like a,

996
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:49,180
and the point there is even if you know
that that's what they're doing to you,

997
00:57:49,181 --> 00:57:51,110
it's still kind of works.
Hey,

998
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:56,590
if you were the type of coach that had
already had this happen before and like

999
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:01,120
you just benched guy and the coach had
the reputation that you don't play around

1000
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:04,630
this, what would have happened in the
first place really? Would it? I agree.

1001
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:09,340
I think so. So you, you may have to
set the example at some point. Yeah.

1002
00:58:09,341 --> 00:58:12,220
The only drawback of that potentially is,
um,

1003
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:16,330
you could cause in high school a lot of
the times like you can have one or two

1004
00:58:16,331 --> 00:58:17,141
guys on the team,

1005
00:58:17,141 --> 00:58:20,980
sometimes even one guy on the team that'll
dictate the outcome of the game where

1006
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:24,490
if this guy's playing, you'll,
you'll probably win. If he's not,

1007
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:28,090
you'll probably lose and you, you have
those dynamics in high school. Um,

1008
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:31,270
so if you run that risk
where, I mean, unless you,

1009
00:58:31,271 --> 00:58:34,840
if you're looking at a bigger picture,
well I guess this is a bad example.

1010
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:36,400
If the guy,
if you,

1011
00:58:36,401 --> 00:58:40,280
if you as a coach run things
in a certain way where you,

1012
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:43,060
where you don't allow any slack.
Yeah.

1013
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:47,330
Then the probability of this
occurring is going to be less. Yeah.

1014
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:50,590
It can be done for sure. Like
you know, it's a funny story.

1015
00:58:50,591 --> 00:58:55,300
Life tell sometimes as we were doing
desert training and long story short,

1016
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:59,350
there's a opportunity to have guys take
a break and go to town and have some

1017
00:58:59,351 --> 00:59:04,060
beer and get a good meal before
the field training exercises start.

1018
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:07,330
And that's normal what everyone does.

1019
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:11,410
But we didn't do that. We didn't
take a break, didn't go get food,

1020
00:59:11,411 --> 00:59:12,490
didn't go get beers and nothing.

1021
00:59:12,491 --> 00:59:17,230
We just got after it and I didn't really
think much of it. But life was like,

1022
00:59:17,231 --> 00:59:18,750
yeah, of course we wanted
to go, but no one will.

1023
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:22,010
No one wanted to ask you cause it was
just like, yeah, no slack, we're not,

1024
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:24,560
obviously we're not, we're not here to
train and get some, we're not here to,

1025
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:29,420
you know, go into town and drink a beer.
No. And it's kind of funny looking back,

1026
00:59:29,421 --> 00:59:34,421
but I think that that you can establish
yourself as a type of leader that's just

1027
00:59:34,461 --> 00:59:36,620
not going to allow like
what are you talking about?

1028
00:59:36,621 --> 00:59:37,550
You don't want to do the drills.

1029
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:42,620
But it starts with the little things like
who knows what this, this kid, you know,

1030
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:45,770
maybe he didn't want to
put on his practice Jersey
and he wanted to wear this.

1031
00:59:45,771 --> 00:59:48,530
You know what I mean? Just like
little things, little things build up.

1032
00:59:48,531 --> 00:59:50,660
And eventually he seemed
just like a normal kid,

1033
00:59:50,661 --> 00:59:53,720
just like a five year old that
pushes the envelope with everything.

1034
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:55,870
Can't get worry about,
well, what can I get away?

1035
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:57,680
Can I get away with that and
what can I get away with?

1036
00:59:58,310 --> 01:00:03,100
People like to push the envelope right
on my life, man. Yeah, no Slattery. Yeah,

1037
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:07,150
but you can go too far with no
slack of course, and you now,

1038
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:10,370
now everyone hates you as a coach
because you just don't understand.

1039
01:00:10,371 --> 01:00:13,010
You don't listen and you're a jerk.
You've,

1040
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:15,440
you've gone too far in one direction
or you've gone too far in the other

1041
01:00:15,441 --> 01:00:19,580
direction. Balanced dichotomy. A
leadership. Get some. Yeah. That's true.

1042
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:23,750
Next question,
Jocko.

1043
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:27,920
Have you ever had a person you couldn't
get through to someone that you couldn't

1044
01:00:27,921 --> 01:00:31,910
manipulate? Then what? What do
you do when you can't get through?

1045
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:34,280
Well, yeah, of course.

1046
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:39,910
I've had people that I could not get
through to and generally speaking,

1047
01:00:39,921 --> 01:00:44,120
these people are like level 12 arrogance.
That's what they are. Giant ego.

1048
01:00:44,121 --> 01:00:45,200
That's what causes this.

1049
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:49,610
There was quite a few seal
leaders that I dealt with.

1050
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:51,500
I shouldn't say quite a few.

1051
01:00:51,501 --> 01:00:54,700
There were several seal leaders that I
dealt with that were like that and have

1052
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:59,750
several business leaders that I've
dealt with that were like that.

1053
01:00:59,751 --> 01:01:02,240
In podcast number five,
I read that counseling letter,

1054
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:06,620
corrective measures to a guy
that was really arrogant.

1055
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:08,750
And despite that letter,

1056
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:12,020
he did not change and he got fired.

1057
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:17,150
So what do you do when you've got someone
that you can't get through to you?

1058
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:21,890
You fire them if they are, if, and
here's what you gotta do is what,

1059
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:25,190
what makes that tricky
is that some people,

1060
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:29,150
and this May this,
this make people freak out.

1061
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:33,470
There's some people that there's such
good performers that even though they're

1062
01:01:33,471 --> 01:01:38,471
slightly negative on maybe
their team participation,

1063
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,580
but they're so good that, that it
offsets their negativity, right?

1064
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:46,410
And that happens. It happens. You know
what happens with saint salespeople,

1065
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:49,670
salespeople are,
are in order to be in a sales position,

1066
01:01:49,671 --> 01:01:51,260
you've got to be confident.
You gotta be aggressive.

1067
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:54,230
You've got to be somewhat arrogant,
right? You gotta believe in yourself.

1068
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:58,220
And so some salespeople take that to
the extreme where they're just like,

1069
01:01:58,221 --> 01:02:00,920
I don't need to listen to what you're
telling me. The new procedures are,

1070
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:03,800
screw that. I'm the one that's
doing the big dollars over here.

1071
01:02:03,801 --> 01:02:07,460
How much you follow my procedures
boys, right? So, so that happens.

1072
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:11,700
Well then what you gotta do is you've
got to look does is this guy producing so

1073
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:15,620
now that can create problems within
the team and you have to balance those

1074
01:02:15,621 --> 01:02:20,100
things. Is this guy,
uh, is the negativity,

1075
01:02:20,101 --> 01:02:25,010
is creating offset by the awesome
productivity Vinnie's doing.

1076
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:27,210
And furthermore, if the
guys that good, hey,

1077
01:02:27,211 --> 01:02:30,390
maybe we should be modeling some things
after them. I got no problem with that.

1078
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:33,150
If you're the best performer,
cool, I want to imitate you.

1079
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,860
I want to get my people to imitate you.

1080
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:38,700
So that happens at the other
place where you might see it.

1081
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:43,730
A similar situation is a leader that
does really good with their relationships

1082
01:02:45,481 --> 01:02:48,180
down the chain of command,
for instance,

1083
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:52,470
but really has bad relations up
the chain of command. So again,

1084
01:02:52,471 --> 01:02:54,600
you've got to ask yourself,
okay, if I fire this leader,

1085
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:57,090
how many of these people that he has great
relationships are now going to leave?

1086
01:02:57,091 --> 01:02:58,650
And what kind of detriment
is that to the team?

1087
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:04,410
That can also happen with someone that's
doesn't debt treats their people like

1088
01:03:04,411 --> 01:03:08,560
crap, but up the chain of command,
everyone thinks it's great and,

1089
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:11,220
and he's getting the mission
done by the way, right?

1090
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:16,140
He's a slave driver and he's creating
total animosity between him and his team,

1091
01:03:16,141 --> 01:03:19,500
but he's accomplishing the mission.
So now what you do, there's risk.

1092
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:22,560
Everyone could quit. There's
rescue, good fireman.

1093
01:03:22,561 --> 01:03:25,680
Now you don't accomplish the mission
anymore. This is why leadership is hard.

1094
01:03:25,681 --> 01:03:29,730
And this is why you have to
balance everything. You have
to balance those things.

1095
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:33,930
But talked about it a bunch of times. If
you get someone, you're coaching them,

1096
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:37,410
you mentor them, you do everything you
can, you have flank them, you do Jujitsu,

1097
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,310
mental Jujitsu on them.
You try and get them squared away.

1098
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:46,230
And eventually if you can't,
you weigh against, you know,

1099
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:49,350
how it's gonna affect the situation.
And then in many cases,

1100
01:03:49,351 --> 01:03:53,050
you've got to let them go. And we
fired, you know, we fired five,

1101
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:57,540
saw plenty of seals, get fired
from leadership positions. Um,

1102
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:01,890
and, and same thing with,
you know, obviously you work
with consulting businesses.

1103
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:07,310
We see all kinds of people getting fired
because they're either not capable of

1104
01:04:07,531 --> 01:04:08,100
doing their job,

1105
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:12,270
they're too arrogant and
they don't recognize that
things are going sideways and

1106
01:04:12,271 --> 01:04:14,190
they're just thinking that they're
doing everything perfectly. No,

1107
01:04:14,191 --> 01:04:18,750
that's not gonna work out well
for you. You know, what did

1108
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:23,240
I think it was Lafe did,
uh,

1109
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:28,380
someone asked him, uh, you
know, when do you know, when's
that line where it's like,

1110
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:31,530
when it's time to fire someone.
And he was like, in a nutshell,

1111
01:04:31,531 --> 01:04:36,180
there's a lot to it, but in
a nutshell, which I thought
was dope. Um, he said it's,

1112
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:39,540
you know, you're at that point where
you, where you fire someone when, um,

1113
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,600
when you don't feel bad about it,
right? So it's like, yeah, you,

1114
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:47,330
you every tried everything. And,
and there's also people boots,

1115
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:51,900
there's some validity to this that say
the first time you think you should fire

1116
01:04:51,901 --> 01:04:55,590
someone, you should fire him. That's
the other end of the spectrum. Right?

1117
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:59,820
And what that means is when you're looking
at someone and you're going, man, okay,

1118
01:04:59,821 --> 01:05:01,020
I can save them,
I can help them.

1119
01:05:01,290 --> 01:05:04,110
That's the kind of advice you
give to someone that's, that's a,

1120
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:09,150
that's got a maternal instinct,
right? That you meet someone, Hey,

1121
01:05:09,151 --> 01:05:12,180
I know what this guy is just a good guy
and everyone on my team is great and

1122
01:05:12,181 --> 01:05:13,200
everyone's going to do great job.

1123
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:18,130
You can't tell that person what
Lafe and normally tell people, which

1124
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:19,570
is when you feel good about it,

1125
01:05:19,571 --> 01:05:22,960
you should fire him because that person
will never feel good about firing

1126
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:25,960
anybody just to see what I'm saying.
Cause he just said, dude, this guy,

1127
01:05:25,961 --> 01:05:28,650
I know he's going to make it. It. No,
he's going to come around, you know I,

1128
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:32,530
and then they, then they start playing
the, the extreme ownership game, which is,

1129
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:34,600
you know, if I would've given
echo a better direction,

1130
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:36,220
he would have been able to do this.
It's my fault.

1131
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:41,560
I've given an echo 17 re iterations of
this and he still didn't complete it

1132
01:05:41,561 --> 01:05:45,570
correctly. He's fired. That's the
way it works, right? There's, yeah.

1133
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:49,750
So balance. So that
spectrum of, of, you know,

1134
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:53,860
being within the confines of
being justified, firing somebody,

1135
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:58,010
a certain type of person, you got to say
when you don't feel bad about it. Right,

1136
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:02,350
right. I mean, that's like a
fire heavy type dude. Right.
But there's also someone,

1137
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:06,370
the reason that you shouldn't feel bad
about it is because I've done everything

1138
01:06:06,371 --> 01:06:10,270
I can do to help you, which
takes work. It takes effort,

1139
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,380
it takes tact.

1140
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:16,450
It takes hard conversations because
it's hard for me to go and say Echo.

1141
01:06:16,451 --> 01:06:19,390
You know, I've been, I've been looking
at your videos lately and they're,

1142
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:22,860
they're not really what we're looking for,
right. I don't want to say that to you.

1143
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:26,210
And you know, I, it's uncomfortable and
we're kind of like, you know, we, we,

1144
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:29,080
we want to get along. So instead I'm like,
yeah, I call that the video was good,

1145
01:06:29,081 --> 01:06:31,390
man. Yeah, it's good, but I'm
not telling you the truth.

1146
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:35,260
And then over time our videos are looking
good enough. And eventually I said,

1147
01:06:35,261 --> 01:06:36,380
you know what?
You know we're not,

1148
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:40,330
no one's buying our videos anymore
and we haven't gotten a new contracts.

1149
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:43,090
So guess what? I'm going to have
to let you go. And you're like,

1150
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:46,470
what you're talking about? You said,
all the videos I made were good.

1151
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:49,150
Now you're firing me. Maybe you need to
be able to become a better salesperson.

1152
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:53,760
Right? Whereas if I had
the hard conversation early
and said, hey, [inaudible],

1153
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,800
you know, I know you're
creative and I appreciate that,

1154
01:06:56,830 --> 01:06:58,810
but we also need to get the
message across for our clients.

1155
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:03,430
Obviously fabricating a business
where we're making videos for clients,

1156
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:07,460
which I know we don't really do a lot
of anymore. Occasionally you do it,

1157
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:12,040
but yeah, you got to, you got to

1158
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,130
have the harder conversations earlier.

1159
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:18,640
If I'm the type of person that doesn't
like to have the hard conversations,

1160
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:21,760
once again, I never feel good
about it because I never,

1161
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:26,230
I never gave you any advice. So it
always feels bad for me to fire someone.

1162
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:30,040
But if you're following
good leadership tactics,

1163
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:34,180
then absolutely true. When you get to a
point where you've got to fire somebody,

1164
01:07:34,181 --> 01:07:36,880
you won't feel bad about it. Cause you
know you've done everything you can,

1165
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:38,680
you know, you've coached
them, mentor them,

1166
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:41,050
and you know that if
you keep them on board,

1167
01:07:41,051 --> 01:07:45,370
you are negatively impacting
your team, which is bad. Yeah.

1168
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:50,350
And then go down to the other side of
the spectrum still within the confines of

1169
01:07:50,351 --> 01:07:52,330
being justified in firing somebody,
by the way.

1170
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:54,730
But on the other side of the spectrum,
you get how you say that,

1171
01:07:54,731 --> 01:07:58,210
what do you call it? The maternal instinct
versus instinct. The person who can,

1172
01:07:58,211 --> 01:08:01,990
like, they're just super hard on
themselves maybe. Or they're, you know,

1173
01:08:01,991 --> 01:08:04,720
like even if you did do everything
you can and you still like,

1174
01:08:04,721 --> 01:08:06,850
I could have done more, you
know, it's my fault, not his,

1175
01:08:06,851 --> 01:08:11,050
I feel like I let them down as a leader
and it gave them 17 counseling. Chits,

1176
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:15,210
they don't belong here. They
can't do their job. Stop. Yeah.

1177
01:08:15,211 --> 01:08:15,990
I mean while they're going home

1178
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:19,110
laughing at you or whatever. But yeah,
you get that kind of personality.

1179
01:08:19,111 --> 01:08:21,630
So it's kind of like how you said you got
to balance it. You gotta be like, okay,

1180
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:24,770
you've got to recognize, okay,
what kind of person am I, you know?

1181
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:26,970
Or what kind of person is this
other person kind of thing.

1182
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:31,080
And if they're those maternal instinct
jewel for lack of a better way of putting

1183
01:08:31,081 --> 01:08:31,914
it person,

1184
01:08:32,190 --> 01:08:37,190
then what was it the first time
you feel like you should fire him,

1185
01:08:37,771 --> 01:08:40,740
you should fire him. You, you hang out
on that side of the spectrum. You got it.

1186
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,083
Yeah.

1187
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:50,820
How do you regain respect from your
employees after you've come across as too

1188
01:08:50,821 --> 01:08:51,654
nice?

1189
01:08:51,690 --> 01:08:56,690
My husband and I are business owners with
45 employees in a small software firm.

1190
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:02,280
Since adding more employees in the last
18 months, the culture is changing.

1191
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:05,370
I blame are easy going attitude.
Increasingly

1192
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:10,620
there is an attitude problem
where negative push back
has become almost a daily

1193
01:09:10,621 --> 01:09:14,190
occurrence.
How do we lead our way out of this?

1194
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:20,990
Okay, well this is a rough one. I'm not,

1195
01:09:20,991 --> 01:09:23,870
by no means I shouldn't have even said
it's a rough one. It's, it's a challenge,

1196
01:09:23,871 --> 01:09:26,210
right?
You have to hit the reset button for sure,

1197
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:29,390
and you got to let people
know that things are changing.

1198
01:09:29,391 --> 01:09:33,980
Now I would straight up
have a meeting that you,

1199
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:39,380
you sit everyone down and say,
hey, here's what's happening.

1200
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:45,030
We are growing and as we grow we are going
to have to evolve just like a person.

1201
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:51,350
As you get older, you have to evolve.
You have to become more mature,

1202
01:09:51,530 --> 01:09:56,330
and here's some of the things that we're
going to have to tighten up, right? Is

1203
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:01,730
instead of, you know, everyone's just,
hey, if you come in and you want to go,

1204
01:10:01,731 --> 01:10:05,780
you got to, you know it's your
kid's birthday. Oh yeah, no
problem. Day Off, you say,

1205
01:10:05,781 --> 01:10:07,220
look,
that's not happening anymore.

1206
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:11,540
We will do our best to let you
out for your daughter's birthday.

1207
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:14,990
We will do our best to let you go.

1208
01:10:14,991 --> 01:10:17,990
Take care of family
members when they're sick.

1209
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:23,290
We will do our best to give you bonuses
that you've become accustomed to.

1210
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:27,020
We will do our best to
give you raises annually.

1211
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:30,320
We will do our best to
continue to take care of you,

1212
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:33,530
but none of those things are guaranteed

1213
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:35,363
at all.

1214
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:41,110
We are trying to be profitable.
In fact,

1215
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:46,290
we have to be profitable in order to
continue as a business on top of being

1216
01:10:47,111 --> 01:10:50,470
profitable. In order to grow, we
have to reinvest in the company.

1217
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:54,370
We have to take the money that we make
and we have to put it back into this

1218
01:10:54,371 --> 01:10:58,360
company in order to grow
and we are going to grow.

1219
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:01,690
That is our goal and in order to grow,

1220
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:06,800
we are going to have to put procedures
and standards in place now that will

1221
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:13,030
allow us to maintain some control
and efficiency as we grow.

1222
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:16,290
If we don't do that,
we're going to fall apart.

1223
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:20,790
So that is what we need to do.
Now why do we want to grow?

1224
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,480
The reason we want to grow is
because we want to be bigger.

1225
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:27,720
We want to create more opportunity
for everyone sitting in this room.

1226
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:30,750
We're not trying to grow for us.
We're trying to grow for everyone.

1227
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:36,150
The more opportunity everyone
has to advance in leadership
up to make more money.

1228
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:42,150
That is what we're trying to do.
But we can only do that if we,

1229
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:43,290
as we grow,

1230
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:47,700
we evolve and become better and
become more efficient and become more

1231
01:11:47,701 --> 01:11:50,550
standardized in the next 18 to 24 months.

1232
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:53,190
That is what we have to do as a company.

1233
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:57,580
So I would have a meeting
and say something like that.

1234
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:58,780
Something along those lines.

1235
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:03,490
Lay down the law a little bit now also
then you have to change your attitude.

1236
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:08,860
You have to somewhat change your
attitude because you are mister nice guy.

1237
01:12:08,861 --> 01:12:11,980
That's how you ended up in this position.
You know, the husband and wife team,

1238
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:13,720
Mister, Mister and Missus, nice guy.

1239
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:20,030
You can and should be nice as a leader.
I understand that.

1240
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:23,090
But at this point the team
meets to get tightened up

1241
01:12:25,150 --> 01:12:27,250
and so you're going to have to
impose some discipline on them

1242
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:33,640
in order for there to be freedom in
the future. Uh, surprisingly. Right.

1243
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:34,910
But we know that now.

1244
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:40,120
I had a friend who was a
platoon commander and he was,

1245
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:44,720
he worked with me and I knew him.
And when he was a platoon commander,

1246
01:12:45,010 --> 01:12:49,310
he was a real nice guy, super nice
guy. When he was a platoon commander,

1247
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,470
he was a nice guy,
super nice guy.

1248
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:56,500
Things didn't work out good for him
because I don't know that, I don't,

1249
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:59,750
I don't specifically know what happened,
but I know that things didn't go great.

1250
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:05,080
And when he talked to me about it, because
the thing is, when I worked with them,

1251
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:08,990
we were all bros and I was young enlisted
guy, but he, we know we all bros,

1252
01:13:08,991 --> 01:13:11,030
but we all had that level of
respect. Hey, you know what?

1253
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:13,850
We can go out and have a beer tonight.
But tomorrow morning when we get to work,

1254
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:16,540
I'm, I'm in the game
and I'm, you know, I'm,

1255
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:21,860
I'm towing the line and that's pretty
much what we were all like all of us,

1256
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:26,880
unless the guys working with this guy
and when he got to this new place,

1257
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,300
new command, all of a sudden
it wasn't like that anymore.

1258
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:32,690
And he was broing out with people
and when you get back into work,

1259
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:35,630
they wanted to bro out at
work and it was like, well,

1260
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:36,860
we don't need to listen to you.

1261
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:40,070
We were having beers with you last night
and that's what he told me. He said,

1262
01:13:40,071 --> 01:13:40,670
you know,
I,

1263
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:45,670
I was too nice of a guy and I didn't get
the respect that I needed to be able to

1264
01:13:49,761 --> 01:13:54,110
effectively run the platoon
and it was not good.

1265
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:56,450
And he said something to me too,

1266
01:13:56,451 --> 01:14:00,590
which I guess I instinctively knew or
maybe I didn't, but it stuck with me.

1267
01:14:00,590 --> 01:14:00,801
You know,

1268
01:14:00,801 --> 01:14:05,801
it's real easy to give more slack to
someone when you have them on a tight

1269
01:14:07,401 --> 01:14:12,160
leash. Right. It's real easy. It's hard
to do. The other thing, it's hard to,

1270
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:14,080
well,
listen to this,

1271
01:14:14,081 --> 01:14:17,350
when I have you on a tight leash and I
give you a little bit slack, you're happy.

1272
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:19,330
You're like, oh look
at Jocko. He trusts me.

1273
01:14:19,331 --> 01:14:23,710
He's letting me go a little bit when I
give you all kinds of all kinds of slack

1274
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,320
and all of a sudden I have to tighten
it up. I start pulling on the leash.

1275
01:14:26,321 --> 01:14:29,500
Well guess what? It chokes your neck.
It jokes. You start bringing in them.

1276
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:33,130
And the further I got to pull you back
on Ian, the longer you're choking for.

1277
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:36,280
And so by the time you get back to me,
you're ready to bite.

1278
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:39,550
And so that's what you have to do.

1279
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:44,320
You don't walk in and put the dogs out
and let them run wild on to the end of

1280
01:14:44,321 --> 01:14:48,100
the leash and let them run wherever they
want and then try and pull them back in.

1281
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:50,500
Because when you let them go, by
the way, you're thinking yourself.

1282
01:14:50,501 --> 01:14:51,700
Well and you know this is a good dog.

1283
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:54,070
And so when I let them run around and
he's not going to do anything wrong,

1284
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:57,070
he's going to be a perfect same when
there's a chance that that's going to

1285
01:14:57,071 --> 01:14:59,740
happen. And there's a chance that that's
a good dog and you let them run around.

1286
01:14:59,741 --> 01:15:01,180
And when you say come back,
he comes back to you.

1287
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:04,450
There's also a chance that he's not a
good dog. And when he gets out there,

1288
01:15:04,451 --> 01:15:05,950
he starts running and started biting.

1289
01:15:05,951 --> 01:15:10,000
People are running into the road
or doing whatever bad dogs do.

1290
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:12,250
And so what?
What are you gonna have to do?

1291
01:15:12,251 --> 01:15:14,440
That dog is you've got to pull
them back to you and it's,

1292
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:18,160
it's actually worse because we already
know this is a bad dog so that when you

1293
01:15:18,161 --> 01:15:20,470
pull him back,
he's pissed and he's going to bite you.

1294
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:24,400
Whereas a good dog wasn't doing
anything bad the first place.

1295
01:15:24,401 --> 01:15:26,080
And when you pull them back in,
he looks at you and goes, Hey,

1296
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:29,530
I must have gone to out of control.
I'm sorry I'm back in line now.

1297
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:31,520
You see what I'm saying?
There's the,

1298
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:36,540
the way the whole thing unfolds
is bad because the bad dog,

1299
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:39,070
he's a bad dog and he's doing bad stuff.

1300
01:15:39,071 --> 01:15:41,170
When you give him slack on the
leash and when you pull them back,

1301
01:15:41,171 --> 01:15:45,400
he's going to snap at you, the good dog.
You give them all kinds of room on leash.

1302
01:15:45,401 --> 01:15:49,060
She's not doing anything good. And when
you pull them back, he goes, he goes, oh,

1303
01:15:49,061 --> 01:15:53,940
sorry, I didn't realize I was doing
something out of line master. Sure. I'll,

1304
01:15:53,941 --> 01:15:57,040
I'll keep it in check now. And you can
give me more slack if you want or not.

1305
01:15:57,041 --> 01:16:00,610
Doesn't matter. I want to be, I want
you to trust me. Meanwhile the bad dog,

1306
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:05,620
he's just like Groundling is pissed.
So that's going to be a hard one.

1307
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:09,070
I'm not, and like I said,
it's not impossible, but the
big thing you've got to do,

1308
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:13,690
I think in this situation you gotta
be clear. Here's what's going on.

1309
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:15,430
You could even potentially,

1310
01:16:15,431 --> 01:16:18,430
I don't know how well you are of
a speaker interacting with people.

1311
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,940
You could even say something along
the lines of, you know, hey look,

1312
01:16:22,030 --> 01:16:26,290
we've been running this real loose
and I've been real, you know,

1313
01:16:26,291 --> 01:16:29,980
we've been doing everything we could to,
to run this as loose as possible,

1314
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,870
but we got to tighten it up.
I think that's the,

1315
01:16:33,871 --> 01:16:35,410
I think you could say that cause
you don't want to say, look,

1316
01:16:35,411 --> 01:16:37,870
I've been being nice and I can't
be nice anymore that, that,

1317
01:16:37,871 --> 01:16:39,850
that comes across wrong. But to say, look,

1318
01:16:39,851 --> 01:16:42,970
we've been running in real loose here
and we've been trying to give you guys as

1319
01:16:42,971 --> 01:16:45,760
much freedom as we can and we still
want you guys to have freedom,

1320
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,860
but we've got to put some
parameters in place that are gonna,

1321
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:53,040
that are gonna allow us to run this bitch
business efficiently as we grow and as

1322
01:16:53,111 --> 01:16:56,350
we scale. You can quote
me on that one, but

1323
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:05,050
yeah, makes sense. When you see him be
clear and consistent, you know, like,

1324
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:06,160
oh, um, you know,

1325
01:17:06,161 --> 01:17:10,100
some people they'll implement rules and
I'm speaking from an employee standpoint

1326
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:13,400
where I'm looking at the boss when they're
trying to put in new rules to tighten

1327
01:17:13,401 --> 01:17:16,730
it up so to speak. Cause in the night
club industry that tends to happen,

1328
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:21,230
you know, managers broing out with,
I like to term bro out, by the way.

1329
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,170
You never heard that if you never
heard that before? I don't think so.

1330
01:17:24,171 --> 01:17:26,270
Not that I can remember,
but it's interesting.

1331
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,520
I thought that was
pretty common vernacular,

1332
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,560
especially amongst a bro like yourself,

1333
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:36,290
bro out broken out with them. Um, yeah.

1334
01:17:36,291 --> 01:17:40,520
And the nightclub managers tend to
bro out with people or you know,

1335
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:43,340
bro out with girls or whatever,
the waitresses, whatever, whatever.

1336
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:45,050
I don't know if you
can bro out with girls.

1337
01:17:45,390 --> 01:17:49,110
I know that's all I have to go over it.
Probably a different word for it,

1338
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:53,120
a group of words, whatever.
Um, but nonetheless, that
tends to happen. So, you know,

1339
01:17:53,121 --> 01:17:55,610
some that sense, same situation, you know,

1340
01:17:55,611 --> 01:18:00,470
you get nightclubs in disarray
as a business, you know,

1341
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:04,430
then they got to tighten it up and apply
more rules and now you got to, you know,

1342
01:18:04,431 --> 01:18:05,990
whatever with the clock ins,

1343
01:18:05,991 --> 01:18:10,350
it's like just a little rules
and negative attitude though.

1344
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:14,390
All these rallies, these damn
rules. Yeah, Bro, I'm a late person.

1345
01:18:14,391 --> 01:18:18,590
So the whole clock in thing. Anyway,
long story, but I'm so anti echoes.

1346
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:25,250
So when the manager would
implement the rules,

1347
01:18:25,251 --> 01:18:28,890
but they don't follow the
rules, you know, it's men. It,

1348
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,460
they just won't take
and people get more mad.

1349
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:36,080
But when you see there was this man
and he died too. Unfortunately. Joel,

1350
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:40,730
he was, um, he was, he was our
boss for, for awhile and he, uh,

1351
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:43,100
he had to kind of do that,
like implement new rules,

1352
01:18:43,101 --> 01:18:46,880
but this was the guy he would bro
out with you. But like it was weird,

1353
01:18:46,881 --> 01:18:51,800
he did this weird kind of balance where
he would break some rules but then he'd

1354
01:18:51,801 --> 01:18:54,350
follow rules.
But the rules that he broke,

1355
01:18:54,351 --> 01:18:56,570
he wouldn't care if you broke them
kind of thing. These are all small,

1356
01:18:56,571 --> 01:19:01,160
teeny tiny goals by the way. Um, but he
was a real consistent person, you know,

1357
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:04,910
where if he wanted something done, we were
all doing it, including him, you know.

1358
01:19:05,090 --> 01:19:06,570
And I remember thinking, man, this,

1359
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:10,730
I really liked this guy in that way as
well where he's telling us to do stuff,

1360
01:19:10,731 --> 01:19:13,640
but he won't like, cause there's other
managers at all, man, I can go into it.

1361
01:19:13,641 --> 01:19:16,610
And then where there's other
managers and they were straight up.

1362
01:19:16,611 --> 01:19:20,550
Like I'm the manager here. It just
needs to be nimble and worships me.

1363
01:19:20,551 --> 01:19:22,580
And it's a weird dynamic
in nightclubs anyway.

1364
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:25,160
And they wouldn't follow the rules at all,
you know,

1365
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:28,580
but you had to cause you're the employee,
you know, kind of thing. But yeah,

1366
01:19:28,581 --> 01:19:31,620
when you're a manager,
and again from an employee standpoint and,

1367
01:19:31,690 --> 01:19:36,690
and I see my boss following
the new rules consistently.

1368
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:39,650
Yeah. It's so much easier to sign
on and it's Kinda like, okay,

1369
01:19:39,651 --> 01:19:41,660
that's what we're doing.
I dig it. And yeah,

1370
01:19:41,661 --> 01:19:45,080
if you combine it with like what you
said, being clear, well I'm down,

1371
01:19:45,170 --> 01:19:49,700
I'm down for the change. I get it,
man. I get it. Oh yeah. Next question.

1372
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:53,840
Jocko.
No bad teams,

1373
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:58,130
only bad leaders and always the
same relationship with each boss.

1374
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,990
Yet you also staged a mutiny.

1375
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,800
How do you reconcile that? Okay,
so what he's talking about,

1376
01:20:06,810 --> 01:20:08,130
obviously no bad teams,
no bad

1377
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:10,890
leaders is from extreme ownership.

1378
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:13,770
And it's actually from before
that Napoleon said the same thing.

1379
01:20:13,771 --> 01:20:17,730
Hackworth said the same thing.
We changed the words a little bit.

1380
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:22,050
But so that's, and then the other thing
he's talking about is that I always say,

1381
01:20:22,051 --> 01:20:24,210
or I have the same relationship
with every boss I've ever had,

1382
01:20:24,211 --> 01:20:27,720
whether they were stupid or smart or
whether they were aggressive or passive,

1383
01:20:27,721 --> 01:20:29,880
whether they were big ego or humble.

1384
01:20:30,030 --> 01:20:31,920
I always had the same relationship
with all of them. That is,

1385
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:36,360
they trusted me and they gave me
what I need you to do my job. So

1386
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:39,470
how do I reconcile the then,

1387
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:43,890
then he's talking about stage to mutiny
because we had a kind of a mutiny in one

1388
01:20:43,891 --> 01:20:48,840
of my platoons,
conductor when I was a young enlisted guy.

1389
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:52,380
And so how can you do that?
Right?

1390
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:56,520
If I had all these great relationships
with all my bosses, but I staged a mutiny.

1391
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:57,301
Interestingly,

1392
01:20:57,301 --> 01:21:00,730
I actually had a decent relationship
with a guy that I staged a mutiny with.

1393
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:04,680
Now that I think about it.
So to go back to the earlier question,

1394
01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:08,700
what I'm talking about being a renegade
and you know, being a rebel and,

1395
01:21:08,701 --> 01:21:12,750
and like I said, you, you have to
rebel when it is necessary. So,

1396
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:17,550
and also for the mutiny that is in
question. I need to make it clear here.

1397
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,680
I didn't stage the mutiny,
it wasn't me.

1398
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:24,840
It was kind of a group effort that was
somewhat led by the leadership of our,

1399
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:27,150
the enlisted leadership of our platoon.

1400
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:31,350
And it was a movement that I certainly
supported and was on board with and we

1401
01:21:31,351 --> 01:21:34,440
were kind of the e five mafia
in that platoon. Sure. Yeah.

1402
01:21:34,441 --> 01:21:39,441
So we were kind of had the voice of the
people write me in a certain group of

1403
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:43,620
guys actually from my buds class who are,

1404
01:21:43,621 --> 01:21:47,700
we're all kind of yeah.
Kind of just fired up about things.

1405
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:52,530
And uh, you know, I,

1406
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:54,600
it wasn't like,
the thing is,

1407
01:21:54,601 --> 01:21:57,390
it wasn't like the platoon commander
had a couple of weaknesses. Right.

1408
01:21:57,900 --> 01:22:01,280
And maybe he wasn't the best of tactics
or maybe it wasn't that, you know,

1409
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:03,530
he wasn't the best shot or anything
like wasn't the best athlete. No,

1410
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:08,430
he was a good athlete. He
tactically, he was like marginal.

1411
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:13,830
Um, but what, he didn't have talk
about this all the time. What,

1412
01:22:13,831 --> 01:22:15,360
he didn't have his,
he didn't have any humility at all.

1413
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:19,590
And so he wasn't listening to anyone
that was giving him any input,

1414
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:25,110
including he had very experienced
senior enlisted advisors.

1415
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:30,000
So the platoon chief and the
platoon Lpo were awesome guys,

1416
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:31,470
very respected seals.

1417
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:36,270
One of them had been in the first Gulf
War on the ground getting after it as

1418
01:22:36,271 --> 01:22:37,200
much as he could.

1419
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:42,570
So these guys were experienced
on the senior chief was a
really, really smart guy

1420
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:45,920
and this guy wasn't listening to.

1421
01:22:47,890 --> 01:22:50,590
And so you had somebody
in the situation was,

1422
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:55,210
they would have been bad for the platoon
to have this type of leader in there.

1423
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:58,510
And now think about this,
if it's bad for the platoon,

1424
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,190
that it's bad for your mission.

1425
01:23:01,950 --> 01:23:02,440
Okay?

1426
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:05,860
If you don't have a good platoon,
you can't execute mission well.

1427
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:11,920
And that's the bottom line to this
question. That is how I reconcile this.

1428
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:17,160
How does this situation affect the mission
affect our ability to accomplish the

1429
01:23:18,161 --> 01:23:19,390
mission?
How does it do it?

1430
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:24,280
If we have a bad leader and
it makes us a bad platoon,

1431
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,290
then we're not going to be
able to accomplish our mission.

1432
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:30,100
And therefore I need to
help get rid of this person.

1433
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:34,180
Because my number one thing that I'm
trying to do is be good at my mission.

1434
01:23:34,370 --> 01:23:35,203
Hmm.

1435
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:41,240
And obviously a more unified team is
going to accomplish the mission more

1436
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:46,320
effectively and more
efficiently, period. So

1437
01:23:48,330 --> 01:23:49,110
that you know what?

1438
01:23:49,110 --> 01:23:54,110
That is why it is so important for people
to understand the mission and the goal

1439
01:23:54,211 --> 01:23:58,260
and the commander's intent.
Because all we've, your decisions

1440
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:04,980
are based on and guided by that
understanding of understanding of what the

1441
01:24:04,981 --> 01:24:05,700
mission is.

1442
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:06,533
Hmm.

1443
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:13,300
So you need to put the mission first
all the time to make the right decision.

1444
01:24:13,791 --> 01:24:17,300
Now, as soon as I say that, what
pops into your head? Oh, Jocko,

1445
01:24:17,301 --> 01:24:21,650
you care about the mission more than
you care about your men. Not True.

1446
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:23,420
Because think about this.

1447
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:27,440
If you are executing
your mission effectively,

1448
01:24:27,890 --> 01:24:30,080
you are taking care of your men.

1449
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:35,540
That's in the business world and it's in
the battlefield because in the business

1450
01:24:35,541 --> 01:24:39,620
world, if I'm executing my, my mission
effectively, guess what we're doing?

1451
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:43,220
We're making more money, be more
profitable, we're gaining more clients,

1452
01:24:43,221 --> 01:24:47,630
we're growing and therefore I'm taking
care of my employees because I'm keeping

1453
01:24:47,631 --> 01:24:50,170
them employed and making them more
bonuses and making them more money and,

1454
01:24:50,171 --> 01:24:54,800
and offering them more leadership
opportunities in combat. Same thing.

1455
01:24:55,580 --> 01:25:00,350
If we are good and I execute my
mission effectively, guess what?

1456
01:25:00,590 --> 01:25:03,650
We've mitigated risk. The, the,

1457
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:07,760
the in the best possible way.
The more we mitigate risk,

1458
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:12,890
the more people are alive,
the blessed casualties we take.

1459
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:16,790
So if I'm doing everything
geared towards the mission,

1460
01:25:17,030 --> 01:25:21,680
then then I am taking care of my men.
Cause by the way,

1461
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:25,880
if I'm running a mission with heavy
casualties, what about my next mission?

1462
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:28,570
Right?

1463
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:32,270
So if you're my boss and you tell me
to charge this machine gun nest with my

1464
01:25:32,271 --> 01:25:37,200
guys and I say, boss, you know we
shouldn't do that right now. You, you,

1465
01:25:37,210 --> 01:25:40,520
you carry out the mission. Okay, well
who's going to do the next mission? Right?

1466
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:44,510
There's not unlimited guys here,
so you can't do it.

1467
01:25:44,511 --> 01:25:49,130
You can't run a mission after you've taken
heavy casualties. Just like you can't.

1468
01:25:49,131 --> 01:25:51,070
If you as a businessperson,

1469
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:56,080
if you expend all of your
capital on one project,

1470
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:58,910
well guess what? You can't do
the next project. So good job.

1471
01:25:58,911 --> 01:26:02,990
You accomplish the one mission,
but you can't accomplish anymore on the,

1472
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:07,130
if you incur a bunch of casualties for
one mission, you can't accomplish anymore.

1473
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:11,440
So in both those cases,
the more effectively you,

1474
01:26:11,530 --> 01:26:15,290
you handle the mission, not just the
one mission, but your broad mission,

1475
01:26:15,291 --> 01:26:17,510
your strategic mission,
the better you do that,

1476
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:22,100
the better you are taking care of your
men and the better you are taking care of

1477
01:26:22,101 --> 01:26:25,040
your people in the business world.
So

1478
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:28,980
and on top of that,

1479
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:30,240
yeah,

1480
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:31,073
on top of that,

1481
01:26:32,490 --> 01:26:37,490
99% of the time your mission is aligned
with the best thing for your people.

1482
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:41,490
That's what I'm saying, 99% of the time,
if we make more money as a company,

1483
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:43,410
it helps all my people.
If we,

1484
01:26:44,130 --> 01:26:48,040
if we accomplish missions in the most
effective and efficient and take the lease

1485
01:26:48,041 --> 01:26:52,140
casualties, that's the best
thing for my people. So,

1486
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:53,930
okay,

1487
01:26:53,930 --> 01:26:57,500
back to the question,
how do I reconcile these things?

1488
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:01,940
I look at how I can best accomplish the
mission and if at best accomplish the

1489
01:27:01,941 --> 01:27:05,480
mission to rebel against what's happening.
There's some cases where I might not,

1490
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:07,640
you might be my boss and
I might not like you,

1491
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:10,970
but you've got a great relationship with
the army commander and we're working in

1492
01:27:10,971 --> 01:27:11,804
their battle space.

1493
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:12,643
Hmm.

1494
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:17,330
Would it make sense for me to throw
a mutiny and get you fired? No.

1495
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:20,540
It would make no sense whatsoever.
It's going to be better for our mission.

1496
01:27:20,570 --> 01:27:22,640
If I say echo socks,

1497
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:25,270
but I'm going to listen to them and we're
going to massage this thing and would

1498
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,590
make things work because he has such
a good relationship with this army

1499
01:27:27,591 --> 01:27:29,870
commander that he,
he's making things happen.

1500
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:30,843
Hmm.

1501
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:35,760
So I might not do it.
I might not stage emit a mutiny.

1502
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,470
Not based on the fact that you,

1503
01:27:37,650 --> 01:27:41,820
that your level of sucking but based on
the fact that what's more important to

1504
01:27:41,821 --> 01:27:45,360
me is that we accomplish our mission
and if you have a good relationship with

1505
01:27:45,361 --> 01:27:48,870
the army commander, I'm going
to keep you around. If you were,

1506
01:27:49,650 --> 01:27:52,920
if you were in a business
situation and you had,

1507
01:27:52,921 --> 01:27:56,460
you were not doing a good job and
you're one of my subordinates,

1508
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:57,780
you're not doing a good job,

1509
01:27:58,350 --> 01:28:02,640
but you have these great relationships
with all these clients and we're

1510
01:28:02,641 --> 01:28:05,400
accomplishing our mission well because
you've built these great relationships.

1511
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:07,770
Am I just going to fire you
because I think you're doing a fix.

1512
01:28:07,771 --> 01:28:10,980
I think you're a crappy leader of
your men. No, actually I'm not.

1513
01:28:11,010 --> 01:28:16,010
What is best for the mission now I might
have to secondary and tertiary plans to

1514
01:28:16,741 --> 01:28:19,770
move you into position where you don't
have to handle the operational things

1515
01:28:19,771 --> 01:28:20,610
that you suck at.

1516
01:28:20,790 --> 01:28:23,700
And I might put you in a position where
you've just going to become, you know,

1517
01:28:23,701 --> 01:28:24,450
a business debt,

1518
01:28:24,450 --> 01:28:27,150
a Biz Dev guy where you're out there
meeting and greeting people cause that's

1519
01:28:27,151 --> 01:28:29,490
what you're good at.
I might make that happen,

1520
01:28:30,330 --> 01:28:32,970
but I'm not just going to go
echo was a bad leader. Fire Him.

1521
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:36,090
Throw away the the skill that you do have.

1522
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:38,670
And now we're not accomplishing our
mission or cause I ruined all the

1523
01:28:38,671 --> 01:28:40,320
relationships.
Cause now you go to all these,

1524
01:28:40,590 --> 01:28:43,650
all these other partners that we have and
you're going to, yeah, Jocko fired me.

1525
01:28:43,710 --> 01:28:46,230
He's pathetic. He goes, it
realize what we're doing here.

1526
01:28:46,290 --> 01:28:48,210
I'm going over to this company.
Come with me.

1527
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:50,010
Bring Your Business over here with me.

1528
01:28:51,570 --> 01:28:53,700
So you reconcile it by
looking at the mission.

1529
01:28:53,701 --> 01:28:58,350
And the mission is almost always aligned
with taking care of your people and

1530
01:28:58,351 --> 01:29:00,870
taking care of your people in the sense of

1531
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:07,430
imposing discipline or not imposing
discipline is being disciplined and making

1532
01:29:07,561 --> 01:29:11,940
them work and giving them,
training them hard, pushing them.

1533
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:15,660
That is generally what taking care of
your people is taking care of your people.

1534
01:29:15,661 --> 01:29:19,310
Is it? Hey, you know what?
Echo, ah, you know, uh,

1535
01:29:19,410 --> 01:29:21,720
don't worry about that video that
you owe to the client. I know you,

1536
01:29:21,721 --> 01:29:24,540
I know what your daughter's birthday.
You go ahead and go home for the day.

1537
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:28,500
Am I taking care of you? If I do that,
they'll say, am I taking care of you? No,

1538
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:32,760
I'm not. I'm actually hurting you
because now we got a bad reputation.

1539
01:29:32,790 --> 01:29:33,960
We delivered the video late.

1540
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:38,610
The company passes word to the
next company. It says, Hey,

1541
01:29:38,611 --> 01:29:40,410
you know those guys are there.
Video is okay,

1542
01:29:40,411 --> 01:29:42,210
but it doesn't matter because it was late.
Hmm.

1543
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:47,100
Now that's the reputation we have now.
Fast forward six months, we're downsizing.

1544
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:49,410
I don't need you anymore. I'm
going to make the, you know,

1545
01:29:49,470 --> 01:29:52,650
I don't need for video makers,
I only need one and you're not the one.

1546
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:55,710
You see what I'm saying?
So I'm not taking care of my people.

1547
01:29:56,640 --> 01:30:01,020
If I focus on the mission, which
is, hey, echo, I apologize.

1548
01:30:01,021 --> 01:30:03,900
I know what your daughter's birthday,
but guess what? We owe this video.

1549
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:06,960
We got to get it done and you got
to get in here and make it happen.

1550
01:30:07,290 --> 01:30:11,580
Am I taking care of you then? Yes, I am.
I know it doesn't feel that way, but yes,

1551
01:30:11,581 --> 01:30:12,414
I am.

1552
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:16,410
Yeah. Yeah. I did.

1553
01:30:18,490 --> 01:30:22,180
Making sure they're equipped,
capable and

1554
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:27,850
treated fairly. Yeah. Yeah.

1555
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:32,410
I said impose discipline on them.
Yeah. And like that doesn't work.

1556
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:33,353
Yeah.

1557
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:39,100
But what you have to do is
you have to impose this point.

1558
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:44,110
There's the dichotomy. Yeah.
Cause you don't want to say echo.

1559
01:30:44,111 --> 01:30:47,710
You will come in and make this video.
I'm imposing Sonia. I'd be like, Echo,

1560
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:48,573
we owe this video.

1561
01:30:48,580 --> 01:30:51,130
We said we're going to turn it in and
let me tell you the ramifications if we

1562
01:30:51,131 --> 01:30:54,670
don't do this. Here's what's going to
hurt. It's going to hurt this, this, this,

1563
01:30:54,671 --> 01:30:55,504
this,
and this.

1564
01:30:55,590 --> 01:30:58,630
Going to eventually could end up with
you not having a job and me not having a

1565
01:30:58,631 --> 01:31:01,540
business. Yeah. Do you like the
sounds of that? No. You don't.

1566
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:02,803
No.

1567
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:07,150
You might be the wrong guy to ask about
this and maybe you're not. I don't know.

1568
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:11,550
But what do you think?
So you mentioned missing your daughter.

1569
01:31:11,590 --> 01:31:14,870
My daughter's birthday. I didn't miss
my daughter's birthday by the way. Um,

1570
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:19,500
did you say you did or did not? Did Not,
but my son just had a first birthday.

1571
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,870
I did miss that,
but it's his first birthday cakes.

1572
01:31:22,090 --> 01:31:26,050
So I've always thought this was before
I had any kids with any birthdays that

1573
01:31:26,860 --> 01:31:29,710
the first birthday, that's where the
parents and stuff for the king, you know,

1574
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:32,890
he doesn't remember the first
year, his first birthday. He never,

1575
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:35,400
no, I'm definitely going to be
the wrong person. No, keep going.

1576
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:40,670
Oh boy.
So missing birthdays,

1577
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:45,440
is that like a bell curve? Like
okay, one first birthday, age one,

1578
01:31:45,470 --> 01:31:49,420
you king sort of miss that age zero.
You can't really miss that. Yeah.

1579
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:53,370
Meaning when they're born, go go, go talk
to the military people in there. I know,

1580
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:55,730
I know, I know. Yeah, no, you're right.

1581
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,070
And I'm saying if you have
the options and you know,

1582
01:31:58,071 --> 01:32:00,040
we're speaking in terms of okay,

1583
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:04,900
if you're, I mean you sort
of have a, like in terms of,

1584
01:32:04,930 --> 01:32:08,260
you know, we're that this company, you're
my boss on the video maker. Hey Echo,

1585
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:11,070
you know, we've got to get this video
done. Whatever. I don't know. That may,

1586
01:32:11,071 --> 01:32:14,410
maybe even in an extreme case,
but I'm saying in a general sense,

1587
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:20,320
which birthdays are more expendable,
that's ultimately the question.

1588
01:32:20,321 --> 01:32:24,010
And it doesn't necessarily mean in this
specific, I'm gonna tell you right now,

1589
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:27,310
as a guy that was in the military for
20 years, the birthday, if you're there,

1590
01:32:27,311 --> 01:32:29,920
it's a luxury. If you're there
for Christmas, it's a luxury.

1591
01:32:29,990 --> 01:32:31,630
If you're there for thanksgiving,
it's a luxury.

1592
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:36,270
I missed all kinds of that stuff all
over the place. Just like a big Joe,

1593
01:32:36,430 --> 01:32:38,920
you big, you know, you're just
not going to be there. Okay.

1594
01:32:38,950 --> 01:32:43,090
So now we're not in the military.

1595
01:32:43,910 --> 01:32:48,400
No. And it's less about
missing him or not. Okay.

1596
01:32:48,401 --> 01:32:52,060
So at the end of the day, no matter
what birthday, even right now,

1597
01:32:52,061 --> 01:32:56,260
you're thinking if you miss
them, no. Huge deal. No,

1598
01:32:56,350 --> 01:33:00,040
I mean if I actually
thought it was a huge deal,

1599
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:05,050
I would have to choose an entirely
different lifestyle and life. Right,

1600
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:10,140
right. And I'll tell you what,
my kids, no. Yeah, yeah. Okay.

1601
01:33:10,150 --> 01:33:12,430
They've always known.
Well, okay, so guess what?

1602
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:16,720
Someone's out there getting
after his name, his name to
my dad. No, no, no. Okay.

1603
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:21,070
Okay. He missed another
birthday. Don't care. I get you
yet. No, you're, I dig it and,

1604
01:33:21,071 --> 01:33:25,870
but that's kind of in a way, I mean,
not to be too specific and split hairs,

1605
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:28,090
but I'm going to do it anyway.
I mean,

1606
01:33:28,091 --> 01:33:31,700
not even necessarily you
and your specific situation.

1607
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:37,120
The most important for exactly around
the spectrum of ages five through 11 five

1608
01:33:39,221 --> 01:33:43,720
through 11 are have the most weight,
most weight. Okay, so not zero,

1609
01:33:43,721 --> 01:33:45,720
not when they're born. Nope. So if you,

1610
01:33:46,030 --> 01:33:50,110
if you miss the birth of your
child because you had to work.

1611
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:51,220
And I'm not saying military,

1612
01:33:51,221 --> 01:33:54,880
I'm saying because you were trying
to finish some report or something or

1613
01:33:54,881 --> 01:33:58,530
whatever or you're trying
to be there. Okay. So,

1614
01:33:58,540 --> 01:34:00,410
but comparatively speaking,
the,

1615
01:34:00,411 --> 01:34:03,430
the birth of your child
compared to the fifth birthday,

1616
01:34:03,431 --> 01:34:06,310
you say fifth birthday is more important
because they don't remember anything

1617
01:34:06,311 --> 01:34:11,140
from zero to four. It's just a big
blue. Dang. That's a good point. And

1618
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:16,540
it's just nothing happening.
All,

1619
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:19,870
it sounds like those parents that you're
taking your kids, and I did this too.

1620
01:34:19,871 --> 01:34:23,000
I actually, I didn't, I did it
with my first kids. My wife's like,

1621
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:26,620
we're going to go to take the girls
to Disneyland and that's it. Oh, okay.

1622
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:31,120
Walking around at Disneyland, which is
pretty close to a living hell to pay.

1623
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:35,800
Actually standing in lines
in the Anaheim summertime,

1624
01:34:36,130 --> 01:34:39,610
like just baking and yet here's the deal.

1625
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:44,830
The girls are just so excited the
whole time and so happy and me.

1626
01:34:44,890 --> 01:34:49,570
No. So now I don't, I haven't been to
any of those things in a long time.

1627
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:50,873
Um,

1628
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:55,840
actually I went with a business
group and walked around Disneyland,

1629
01:34:55,870 --> 01:34:57,980
Disney world and I was

1630
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:02,450
like, you've gotta a killer
now, but this is the thing.

1631
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:04,940
The kids don't remember it. You can
show them pictures and they go, oh,

1632
01:35:04,941 --> 01:35:07,300
that's cool. You can stage those
pictures like oh nine landings.

1633
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:11,960
Like just set them up and be
like, oh yeah, Cinderella,

1634
01:35:11,961 --> 01:35:15,400
whatever. We seem to be four or five.
Yeah, five years. Okay. Actually men.

1635
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,210
That's a good point
because when I say now,

1636
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:21,230
I'm sure there's developmental things
happening. When there, when you do things,

1637
01:35:21,231 --> 01:35:23,120
when you participate in
activities with your kids,

1638
01:35:23,121 --> 01:35:27,380
obviously zero to five but you know,
you could probably,

1639
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:32,470
it probably be more developmentally
helpful for you to spend a day with them,

1640
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:34,191
you know,

1641
01:35:34,191 --> 01:35:38,780
coaching them and in Jujitsu or coaching
them and boxing or coaching them and

1642
01:35:38,781 --> 01:35:43,220
Moitai or coaching them and shooting
or coaching them in archery or coaching

1643
01:35:43,221 --> 01:35:48,221
them and go hunting small animals or
coaching them in how to do combat trauma

1644
01:35:48,411 --> 01:35:52,750
care. Just like general failure four year
old. Yeah, you're right. You're right. Um,

1645
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:56,940
yeah, yeah. That's as opposed to hey,
you're going to Disneyland. Look at, yeah,

1646
01:35:57,010 --> 01:36:00,470
that's another good question is like the
birthday thing. So, so, so cause the only,

1647
01:36:00,471 --> 01:36:04,850
cause you mentioned because by 11 they
don't care anymore. By 11 they don't care.

1648
01:36:05,210 --> 01:36:09,970
Oh well my kids were, were all like,
oh my birthday, don't care. Yeah.

1649
01:36:09,971 --> 01:36:12,960
So man, that's a good place. We have
a rule. You get to pick your word,

1650
01:36:12,970 --> 01:36:14,720
you go out for dinner
on your birthday night.

1651
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:16,910
And in the last like five birthdays,

1652
01:36:16,911 --> 01:36:19,750
we haven't even been able to
pull that off successfully. Yeah.

1653
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,940
So obviously it's going to be what,
what the group is used to.

1654
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:26,600
But as far as the kid in you
missing the birthday for, you know,

1655
01:36:26,601 --> 01:36:28,340
for the cow was a kid.
You know what I used to pick,

1656
01:36:28,341 --> 01:36:30,740
cause I that used to be in my family too.
We get to like pick dinner.

1657
01:36:30,741 --> 01:36:35,330
You notice to pick. Yeah. Chicken
patties. Chicken for dinner. Oh,

1658
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:37,970
just from the floor store.
Just get some chicken patties.

1659
01:36:37,971 --> 01:36:39,600
I used to love those things. Dang. Yeah.

1660
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:42,380
I remember in school I went
to Koloa elementary school.

1661
01:36:42,381 --> 01:36:44,690
I used to love the chicken patties.
They're, yeah, they're dope.

1662
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:48,290
The chicken patties or you sound like
chicken mcnugget local. Big Flat Chicken.

1663
01:36:48,291 --> 01:36:51,860
Mcnuggets yeah. And I didn't even like,
I didn't like steak until I was in the,

1664
01:36:52,750 --> 01:36:53,140
because,

1665
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:56,140
because we didn't have a lot of state
grown up because steak is expensive. Yeah.

1666
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:59,000
You know what I mean? Yeah. Especially
that Ribeye. Yeah. Especially that Revi.

1667
01:36:59,090 --> 01:37:03,500
So we didn't have steak, we had chicken
patties tasted good to me. Pretty Dope.

1668
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:04,670
And sometimes you know what else?

1669
01:37:04,671 --> 01:37:08,380
Of course you want Mcdonald's when
you're seven. Sure anyone's codes.

1670
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:11,000
Get some fries and a shamrock shake shack.

1671
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:16,310
I had told, cause you know I
love mint chocolate chip, right?

1672
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:19,430
So I had told all my kids about the,

1673
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:24,440
the original mint chocolate chip milkshake
was the shamrock shake it Mcdonald's

1674
01:37:24,441 --> 01:37:27,500
back in a dairy, which they'd
have around Saint Patty's day,

1675
01:37:27,501 --> 01:37:31,710
which by the way isn't around my birthday,
but it just made, came to my mind. So,

1676
01:37:32,490 --> 01:37:36,620
so when I was a kid,
we had shamrock shakes.

1677
01:37:37,450 --> 01:37:41,390
Saint Patty's Day, they're mint
shakes. And when I was a kid,

1678
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:44,930
they were amazing and I was so,

1679
01:37:45,140 --> 01:37:50,090
and I hadn't had one in 30 years,
maybe more, maybe 40 years,

1680
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:54,050
hadn't had a shamrock shake. And I saw a
little advertisement. I said, all kids,

1681
01:37:54,051 --> 01:37:55,770
guess what?
These are like mint chocolate chip

1682
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:57,740
milkshakes,
but there's no chocolate chips.

1683
01:37:57,741 --> 01:38:02,741
So it's just smooth mint ice
cream milkshake from Mcdonald's.

1684
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:05,310
Yup. Can I sent my daughter
out to go get us all?

1685
01:38:06,030 --> 01:38:10,890
Go get us all shamrock shakes brought
him home. They worked disgusting.

1686
01:38:11,310 --> 01:38:15,300
They were nothing like what they
used to be. Yeah. So Mcdonald's,

1687
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:19,650
I gave you a shot. Sorry about that.
I'm surprised he gave him a shot.

1688
01:38:20,090 --> 01:38:20,551
I am too,

1689
01:38:20,551 --> 01:38:23,820
but it's been 40 something years beats
since I had a shamrock shake and I

1690
01:38:23,821 --> 01:38:28,010
remembered him, so I figured we'll go
with it. Maybe there was gusting gather,

1691
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:32,250
probably go. Not even my kids liked him.
Not even my eight year old Dang, who just,

1692
01:38:32,251 --> 01:38:34,980
you know, is an eight year old
that just looks at things and say,

1693
01:38:35,070 --> 01:38:38,550
that's ice cream. I'm on it. She didn't
even like it. None of them. No one.

1694
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:43,270
They were discussing, we threw them
all away. Don't waste your money. Yeah,

1695
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:46,170
don't waste your money. Yeah. Don't
waste your money on Mcdonald's.

1696
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:50,910
That's my personal recommendation period.
Shamrock shake or other otherwise, yeah,

1697
01:38:50,911 --> 01:38:54,240
yeah, yeah. It's not help not
help. Not Helping you in any way.

1698
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:56,910
Did you know that they just,

1699
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:59,370
I mean this is gonna sound obvious
now that I'm saying it out loud.

1700
01:39:00,510 --> 01:39:05,430
They add the green coloring to it,
to the ice cream. Make it green.

1701
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:09,240
Well, yeah, when you get briars
it's white. Yeah. I got here,

1702
01:39:09,340 --> 01:39:14,040
I've talking to him one, I mean my wife
and whatever family, the family goes to a,

1703
01:39:14,190 --> 01:39:18,630
or the Oregon coast. That's
where the Tillamook cheese
factory. Wait chief. Yeah.

1704
01:39:18,670 --> 01:39:22,250
Tillamook cheese.
The actual big factory.

1705
01:39:22,740 --> 01:39:24,870
And you can go on little tours and they
give you ice cream. I'm like, okay,

1706
01:39:24,871 --> 01:39:27,330
I want that mint mint chip of course.

1707
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:30,510
And they give it to me and they
hand it to math and I'm like,

1708
01:39:30,511 --> 01:39:32,250
the first time I see it, I was
like, Hey, that's not mine.

1709
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:36,280
That's obviously just the
regular chocolate over here.

1710
01:39:36,630 --> 01:39:39,840
And I for real said that. I was like, oh,
I ordered the mint. And he goes, Oh yeah,

1711
01:39:39,841 --> 01:39:42,690
that's meant. And then it all
kind of came to me like, Oh yeah,

1712
01:39:42,691 --> 01:39:45,870
I'm pretty dumb for if you get briars.
Briers is white,

1713
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:51,270
which is the preferred brand, to be quite
honest with you. Is it okay. All right.

1714
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:55,650
Well, at least at least the
ones that I've tried. Yeah. So,

1715
01:39:56,490 --> 01:39:59,100
so back to the birthday thing,

1716
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:04,230
if you miss the birth of your child,
technically you're right.

1717
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:05,670
Technically for the question,

1718
01:40:05,671 --> 01:40:10,260
because I'm talking about like how upset
or how much is it going to mean not

1719
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:13,380
affected at all at all really.
But here's the thing,

1720
01:40:13,890 --> 01:40:17,420
if it like as a cohesive family, that
might be a thing. If you have the option,

1721
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:21,960
I'm saying if you're overseas, come, come
on man, let's face it. That's a legit,

1722
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:25,230
but if you have the choice,
so you miss the birth of your child,

1723
01:40:25,231 --> 01:40:28,740
that's more of like a family thing.
Like, okay, but that's not what,

1724
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:33,060
that's not the question because
it's always the first birthday,

1725
01:40:33,061 --> 01:40:35,620
the first year birthday. That's kind
of a, it's for the adults. Yeah.

1726
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:39,390
It's for the other people. Second,
third, fourth, and fifth. The fourth.

1727
01:40:39,391 --> 01:40:42,830
And in my experience, maybe they're
in the game a little bit. Yeah. Yeah.

1728
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:45,960
It depends on the kid who's conditioned
them that they don't expect anything

1729
01:40:45,961 --> 01:40:50,880
good. Yeah, I guess, yeah.
Life Sucks, man. Life sucks.

1730
01:40:50,940 --> 01:40:53,770
Nothing special about your stupid
birthday. Everybody loses a bunch of,

1731
01:40:53,771 --> 01:40:56,350
you were born on that day.
A bunch of people born tomorrow.

1732
01:40:56,490 --> 01:41:01,450
A bunch of people born yesterday.
Get over yourself, kid. Concur,

1733
01:41:01,570 --> 01:41:06,220
four years old. I know. Bunch
of people who turn four anyway.

1734
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:11,620
Uh, agree. I think that
age two all the way to

1735
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:18,410
21 that's my opinion. Those are the ones
that if they want you there, ew, ew,

1736
01:41:18,550 --> 01:41:22,330
ew. I don't make cars going to
watch around at her 21st birthday.

1737
01:41:22,331 --> 01:41:26,960
She better otherwise. Cabo
going to say that. Right?

1738
01:41:28,130 --> 01:41:32,970
She's not a lot in comp. Cabo, Shinola,
check. We're going to be way more.

1739
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:36,370
Yeah,
more Jocko.

1740
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:40,570
What do you think about when you
don't feel like getting after it?

1741
01:41:42,570 --> 01:41:47,180
You know,
I put this out the other day and

1742
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:51,440
I think it's important.
All right,

1743
01:41:51,470 --> 01:41:55,100
so Rome wasn't built in a day.

1744
01:41:56,300 --> 01:42:00,050
We all know that.
Everyone hears that,

1745
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:05,630
but Rome also didn't fall
apart overnight either.

1746
01:42:07,850 --> 01:42:12,850
It took hundreds of years
for Rome to reach its peak,

1747
01:42:13,580 --> 01:42:14,930
but it also took time,

1748
01:42:15,980 --> 01:42:20,980
hundreds of years for Rome
to decay and fall apart,

1749
01:42:24,890 --> 01:42:29,890
and that is representative of life
because you don't achieve worthwhile goals

1750
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:38,810
quickly or easily.
They take time,

1751
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:41,330
they take struggle,

1752
01:42:42,350 --> 01:42:47,350
they take relentless
pursuit day in and day out.

1753
01:42:48,470 --> 01:42:49,670
That's what it takes.

1754
01:42:52,550 --> 01:42:53,080
Okay.

1755
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:58,080
But also things don't usually
fall apart quickly either.

1756
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:04,360
At least at first it,
it's, it's a slow process.

1757
01:43:05,230 --> 01:43:09,730
A little slip here,
little set back over there,

1758
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:14,940
a little wearing down of
discipline and will over time.

1759
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:21,673
That's the thing.

1760
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:26,680
Success and failure are
generally slow processes

1761
01:43:29,030 --> 01:43:31,460
either slowly building things up

1762
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:36,080
or gradually tearing them down.

1763
01:43:40,060 --> 01:43:43,900
And that's why I say you've
got to pay attention.

1764
01:43:46,830 --> 01:43:48,840
You have to watch,

1765
01:43:48,990 --> 01:43:52,760
you have to watch every single second.

1766
01:43:55,740 --> 01:43:56,573
Okay.

1767
01:43:57,090 --> 01:43:58,410
Because those seconds

1768
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:05,390
they turn into minutes and minutes turn
into hours and hours turned into days

1769
01:44:08,190 --> 01:44:10,950
and days turn in two years.

1770
01:44:14,590 --> 01:44:15,423
Yeah.

1771
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:18,540
Hints.
So that second,

1772
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:24,150
that second that just went by.
That counted.

1773
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:30,930
Thanks. So did that second
and so did that one and Ian,

1774
01:44:31,540 --> 01:44:35,680
those precious seconds,
you are either building

1775
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:43,070
or you were decaying.
You are either gaining ground.

1776
01:44:44,440 --> 01:44:45,090
Yeah.

1777
01:44:45,090 --> 01:44:49,040
Or You were losing ground
in that second

1778
01:44:51,490 --> 01:44:53,070
and in every second,

1779
01:44:57,460 --> 01:44:59,770
every second counts.

1780
01:45:03,910 --> 01:45:08,910
So make every second

1781
01:45:10,870 --> 01:45:11,703
count.

1782
01:45:15,610 --> 01:45:16,750
And I think

1783
01:45:18,970 --> 01:45:22,570
that's all I've got for tonight.

1784
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,500
So Echo,

1785
01:45:26,501 --> 01:45:31,501
if people want to make it
count for this podcast,

1786
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:34,510
maybe you could

1787
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:40,130
tell them how they can go ahead
and do that if they want to.

1788
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:41,233
Sure.

1789
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:45,290
Be Happy to actually,
when we're talking about origin,

1790
01:45:47,420 --> 01:45:51,020
why did Pete choose origin as
thinning? He told the story, right?

1791
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:54,230
That must be slacking on
the listening on though.

1792
01:45:54,530 --> 01:45:59,530
Nonetheless it makes sense
because the origin of all these,

1793
01:46:01,130 --> 01:46:05,750
all the gear is here in
the u s just happens to be.

1794
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:08,480
But that's a big thing.
The origin.

1795
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:13,600
So what do we make gies out of say cotton,

1796
01:46:14,150 --> 01:46:15,890
you know? Okay, well we'll
just take the cotton,

1797
01:46:15,950 --> 01:46:19,700
grow the cotton in the u s what
do they do with the cotton?

1798
01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:23,800
Turn it into they do. Yeah.
Yes. Stuff. Diet. Yeah.

1799
01:46:24,130 --> 01:46:27,670
Turn it into a fabric.
Oh yeah,

1800
01:46:28,590 --> 01:46:33,000
yeah. And they do all of that. They
don't import it, you know, from wherever.

1801
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:36,930
You know, some undisclosed
American Hailey's. Yeah. Anyway,

1802
01:46:37,020 --> 01:46:40,620
so maybe that's why it's called origin.
Cause the origin is a significant thing.

1803
01:46:41,130 --> 01:46:44,310
Right. Anyway. All right, cool.
So origin, what is origin?

1804
01:46:44,311 --> 01:46:48,840
Origin is the best gear
in the world. Straight up.
Objectively, not subjectively.

1805
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:50,070
Objectively.
I

1806
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:51,960
got proof bump,
so I got to Ge.

1807
01:46:51,990 --> 01:46:56,370
We went to this origin immersion
camp for Jujitsu origin,

1808
01:46:57,140 --> 01:47:00,270
Jujitsu immersion camp.
Nope. Good Fun. By the way,

1809
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:04,920
that was your first time in the origin
g wasn't it? Yes, I think. Yeah.

1810
01:47:05,790 --> 01:47:10,510
Yeah. I saw you with
yours. It was cool. Um,

1811
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:14,750
yeah, so cool camp. Got The g, um,

1812
01:47:15,510 --> 01:47:18,000
then I come home, got to, by the way,

1813
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:22,380
actually I got to keep
tops one pair of pants. Um,

1814
01:47:23,850 --> 01:47:27,560
come home, made me want to train more
in the gay. By the way, I thought,

1815
01:47:27,561 --> 01:47:31,230
I don't know if it was the
gay or the camp. We're both
probably both. Yeah. Anyway,

1816
01:47:31,231 --> 01:47:36,231
so this whole week I changed and every
single time I went in someone mentioned

1817
01:47:36,961 --> 01:47:40,470
the Ge and it's not like it's pink or
something like that. When they're like,

1818
01:47:40,471 --> 01:47:44,610
hey CFO, put on his g, yeah, it's
normal. You can get the blue. I had the,

1819
01:47:44,611 --> 01:47:48,300
I have the white one and everyone
is like, oh, what's that?

1820
01:47:48,330 --> 01:47:52,500
Jeff Glover was one of them. And this
is the person who's like, you know,

1821
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:55,980
if he says that it's something,
it's not like some, you know,

1822
01:47:55,981 --> 01:47:59,850
fashion person has had don't like that
logo or that's a cool, you know, anyway,

1823
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:03,950
it was someone who knows. Anyway,
everyone asking like what up with his ski.

1824
01:48:03,951 --> 01:48:06,360
So I go into the spiel made here.

1825
01:48:06,930 --> 01:48:09,210
I might have lost somebody cause
they took real long saying it.

1826
01:48:09,211 --> 01:48:12,600
But nonetheless it's dope.
And then another one was Jeff Higgs.

1827
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:17,310
We know who that is. [inaudible] do
you know who that is? I sure do. Yeah.

1828
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:19,770
The person that Joppa talks about,

1829
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:22,560
when he first started to
get introduced to Jujitsu,

1830
01:48:23,070 --> 01:48:25,110
the guy who reintroduced to Jujitsu,

1831
01:48:25,490 --> 01:48:29,880
he and I got introduced to Jujitsu
together and then he went out and trained

1832
01:48:29,881 --> 01:48:34,790
hard. Yeah, I think it was the day he
got his purple belt has purple house,

1833
01:48:34,810 --> 01:48:35,310
the White,

1834
01:48:35,310 --> 01:48:40,310
I mean we trained with master chief Bailey
overseas that for like three months.

1835
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:43,890
And then we came back.
We are in different platoons,

1836
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:47,570
but he started training for
real with Fabio Santos. Yeah.

1837
01:48:48,030 --> 01:48:50,100
And the day he got his purple belt,

1838
01:48:50,250 --> 01:48:51,480
I'm pretty sure it was
the day you got us for,

1839
01:48:51,490 --> 01:48:55,110
well he came to my house and was like,
let's go train. And I said all yeah,

1840
01:48:56,250 --> 01:49:00,340
so think about purple belt versus
white belt and he, you know,

1841
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:01,830
triangle arm lock,

1842
01:49:02,820 --> 01:49:07,050
everything rear naked choke and it's
Kinda tall. Too Tall. He's tall,

1843
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:09,260
strong,
putting beat down bone.

1844
01:49:09,261 --> 01:49:14,261
You boney like in terms of when
he's impacting you with his elbows.

1845
01:49:15,660 --> 01:49:20,580
Yeah. Real bony. He's hitting me.
He's got the bones cutting. Yeah.

1846
01:49:20,581 --> 01:49:24,210
He's like this triangle feels like it's
going to cut your head off cause he's

1847
01:49:24,211 --> 01:49:28,830
bony. Yeah. He knows some
good judo too, Huh? Yeah,

1848
01:49:29,190 --> 01:49:33,800
yeah, yeah. And he's got a
real, he's got a real, um,

1849
01:49:34,890 --> 01:49:39,890
he's always in touch with the whole
idea of using this to effectively defend

1850
01:49:41,761 --> 01:49:45,660
yourself in a street and scenario.
He's always in touch with that.

1851
01:49:46,030 --> 01:49:48,010
He always adds in a little,
and if you're in the

1852
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:51,010
street you could do, there's
four idea. He did that.

1853
01:49:51,070 --> 01:49:55,950
I went up to studio five 40.
Yeah. Oh, oh for Berry Street.

1854
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:59,620
I had to train at 10:00 AM I had some
stuff to do and then they were only doing

1855
01:49:59,621 --> 01:50:04,621
no gay at the VI suckled studio five
40 he exists teaching the class.

1856
01:50:06,010 --> 01:50:09,730
Rob's Apps, he's the owner or
whatever. Even he mentioned
the Ge, he was like, well,

1857
01:50:09,731 --> 01:50:11,350
he's like, what gives is this? Yeah.

1858
01:50:11,580 --> 01:50:15,580
Cause it's a different material
specially not only specially made,

1859
01:50:15,910 --> 01:50:20,170
especially woven, specially designed for
Jujitsu. Yeah. So yeah. And I was like,

1860
01:50:20,171 --> 01:50:23,360
Oh yeah, that's that origin
stuff. Don't worry about that.
And he's like, oh I like,

1861
01:50:23,370 --> 01:50:27,080
I think I might have one. You know,
he's the kind of with like 1000 sec,

1862
01:50:27,090 --> 01:50:29,050
I think I have one of these or whatever.
And I was like,

1863
01:50:29,051 --> 01:50:33,010
you don't have this one bro. And I
just kept walking, you know. Anyway,

1864
01:50:33,011 --> 01:50:36,760
then afterwards it was afterwards when
Higgs was like, he's like, this is the,

1865
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,230
I think he even said this
is the most interesting gay.

1866
01:50:39,250 --> 01:50:42,010
And he was like rubbing it in his fingers,
you know, when he grabbed my sleep,

1867
01:50:42,190 --> 01:50:45,220
if this is the most interesting guy
I've ever seen, something like that.

1868
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:49,660
You know when that's the
axiom guerrilla we've,

1869
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:54,040
yeah, cause they have a normal per wave,
which looks like the little tiny purse.

1870
01:50:54,100 --> 01:50:55,900
Sure.
American parole.

1871
01:50:56,170 --> 01:51:00,540
But the axiom that gorilla weave is,

1872
01:51:01,070 --> 01:51:05,890
or is it the Dragon? We've, they both
look very similar. Yeah. But they're both,

1873
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:09,550
we've, oh yeah. One of them
looks like, um, like it's like,

1874
01:51:10,390 --> 01:51:13,480
I'm not going to say velvet, I'm not
going to do that. But it looks like that,

1875
01:51:13,510 --> 01:51:15,880
you know. No, it looks like
diamonds. Which one was the one,

1876
01:51:15,890 --> 01:51:18,910
remember we were looking at, um, and uh,
we were looking and they were saying like,

1877
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:22,690
like I was like, Dang, this looks super
luxurious. That's not the one I have.

1878
01:51:22,691 --> 01:51:26,410
By the way. He was like this up. The other
one, I don't know which one was which.

1879
01:51:26,411 --> 01:51:31,390
But nonetheless, people seem to like
the geeks and the pants are dope.

1880
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:35,140
It has the, it's like you
can choose drawstring, but it
has the, um, like, you know,

1881
01:51:35,141 --> 01:51:38,830
like surf shorts where they have the
velcro Boehm and it's like fitted.

1882
01:51:38,831 --> 01:51:42,050
They go and sizes like of your
waste. It's not just like er, uh,

1883
01:51:42,430 --> 01:51:45,490
which actually I'm not against
the whole a one 82 83, you know,

1884
01:51:45,610 --> 01:51:49,040
I'm not against that. It's actually,
it's fine. It's cool. Super simple. Um,

1885
01:51:49,570 --> 01:51:54,220
but this is good. It's like when you get
it, you can order yours, pant size, boom.

1886
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:58,390
But you know, when you put it on it's
going to be dope anyway. And it is dope.

1887
01:51:58,391 --> 01:52:02,530
And you know,
the public responded in that way as well.

1888
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:07,810
So also rash guards, tee shirts. Yeah.
We're gonna make a bunch of other stuff.

1889
01:52:07,850 --> 01:52:10,390
Yeah, there's some cool stuff on
there and the point is really sure.

1890
01:52:10,391 --> 01:52:14,410
I'm talking about the guy because I was
all up in that gee this week and that's

1891
01:52:14,411 --> 01:52:18,040
fresh on my mind and it's one of
those things that sticks in there. Um,

1892
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:22,330
also at the camp, um, you know how
like when you give your laundry,

1893
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:25,310
I only had one. So you give your
laundry, you, you're out of Ge,

1894
01:52:25,330 --> 01:52:28,250
you can't go to the next session unless
you get another Gig, which is kind of,

1895
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:29,800
I wasn't really about that,

1896
01:52:29,801 --> 01:52:34,801
but so I would use them twice in a
row and they dry surprisingly fast.

1897
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:38,230
It's not going to surprise.
They drive fast.

1898
01:52:38,290 --> 01:52:42,460
They're not a hundred
percent cotton and polyester.

1899
01:52:42,461 --> 01:52:46,250
I think in there with silver coated,
they non-AHC Kenny.

1900
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:51,230
It's antimicrobial. Silver coating on it.
Not like silver. You can see it. Yeah.

1901
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:52,970
But yeah,
that's why that's the thing,

1902
01:52:53,090 --> 01:52:55,010
that's the same thing with
mine when I pulled mine out,

1903
01:52:55,070 --> 01:52:57,680
when I pull mine out of the washing
machine after the spin cycle,

1904
01:52:57,681 --> 01:53:02,540
it's almost dry. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like a
pair of surf shorts basically. But Dang,

1905
01:53:02,541 --> 01:53:06,590
it feels comfortable. It's nice.
Yeah. So yeah, man. Anyway, so yeah,

01:53:06,591 --> 01:53:11,480
or origin main, like the State

01:54:10,340 --> 01:54:14,080
Furbished is Furby shingle
word for refurbishing. Right.

1922
01:54:14,120 --> 01:54:18,740
But the refurbishing is just doing it
again or, yeah, for sure. For a machine.

1923
01:54:19,780 --> 01:54:22,300
And that's got the things
that I always take.

1924
01:54:23,660 --> 01:54:28,660
Curcumin [inaudible] and the [inaudible]
is in the form of sea cucumber suite.

1925
01:54:30,620 --> 01:54:34,910
That's where it comes from
me. So yeah. Well, the legit,

1926
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,260
the ancient not interesting,

1927
01:54:36,261 --> 01:54:40,160
I guess you could call it layers is
this is exactly what you were taking for

1928
01:54:40,161 --> 01:54:43,520
years and you were like gay guests.
What origin in the house?

1929
01:54:43,521 --> 01:54:45,680
Let's just make that, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1930
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:48,980
Well sometimes I'd have to combine
different things before. Yeah.

1931
01:54:49,430 --> 01:54:53,090
But now I don't have to combine anything
anymore. They're already combined joint.

1932
01:54:53,091 --> 01:54:55,930
We're going to combine it into one deal.
Yeah.

1933
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:58,400
It's warfare.

1934
01:54:58,730 --> 01:55:01,970
Joint warfare against doing
against joint weakness. Yup.

1935
01:55:02,750 --> 01:55:05,280
It's a good idea too, by the way,
because now I've got two kids.

1936
01:55:05,281 --> 01:55:08,990
I remember when I told the story like,
you know when you wake up and my daughter,

1937
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10,940
she told that story. Yeah.
I'm going to tell it again.

1938
01:55:10,941 --> 01:55:14,660
So she's the jump on my back
when I, when you, right,

1939
01:55:14,661 --> 01:55:16,340
when you wake up that's your least warm.

1940
01:55:16,430 --> 01:55:18,220
That's when you're trying
to warm up and get,

1941
01:55:18,230 --> 01:55:22,670
do physical stuff that least warm you'll
ever be just in everyday life is when

1942
01:55:22,671 --> 01:55:23,480
you wake up.
Yeah.

1943
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:28,100
Those first 12 burpees or are hard one
hour before you do the burpees that

1944
01:55:28,101 --> 01:55:31,550
moment. So this is the exact
moment when my daughter, you know,

1945
01:55:31,551 --> 01:55:35,930
40 pounds or so jumped on my back, my
shoulders, my back, where my shoulders,

1946
01:55:35,940 --> 01:55:39,770
whatever she chose. And you know, after I
took Krill for, I think it was like five,

1947
01:55:39,771 --> 01:55:43,470
six days, boom. I could easily do it.
I didn't have to like focus on my form,

1948
01:55:43,471 --> 01:55:44,304
nothing like that.

1949
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:49,700
Now I've got two kids and my
daughter who's older is heavier.

1950
01:55:50,340 --> 01:55:52,590
So not this morning,

1951
01:55:52,650 --> 01:55:56,850
yesterday morning I go to wait
grill up for school or whatever.

1952
01:55:56,851 --> 01:55:59,940
I already have my son, he weighs, I don't
know how much she weighs, but he's one,

1953
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:05,400
I have him, she still wants to jump on my
shoulder. I have him cause he's like, oh.

1954
01:56:05,401 --> 01:56:08,280
And then he sees her jumping asleep shit.
So basically I'm the,

1955
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:12,480
what do you call it, the vehicle that
they're writing on early in the morning,

1956
01:56:12,481 --> 01:56:17,310
by the way. Still no problem.
Still going strong. So yeah, man,

1957
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:21,720
that's it. That's a joint warfare
situation right there and Krill supercrew.

1958
01:56:23,070 --> 01:56:24,870
Get on it.
You'll be glad you did.

1959
01:56:24,871 --> 01:56:29,871
Also checkout on it.com/jocko this
is where I get my kettle bells.

1960
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:33,990
Then I meant, I mentioned this, I
got the gorilla ones, 72 pounds.

1961
01:56:33,991 --> 01:56:36,420
So I'm cruising right,
not lifting,

1962
01:56:36,421 --> 01:56:40,920
cruising and jade comes, my brother
comes in. I was like, I was like, yeah,

1963
01:56:40,921 --> 01:56:43,960
go check out this new kettle bells
I got. And it goes, it's all, Yay.

1964
01:56:44,020 --> 01:56:45,810
Those are cool. I was like,
go ahead, pick them up.

1965
01:56:45,950 --> 01:56:50,370
He goes and make that kind of heavy, you
know? But I've been doing kettle bells,

1966
01:56:50,371 --> 01:56:54,870
so I was like, Nah, let me show you
what not even warmed up. Nothing.

1967
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:56,400
Speaking of Krill oil.
Yeah.

1968
01:56:56,430 --> 01:57:00,390
It was actually really the Krill
oil springing into action. Really.

1969
01:57:02,010 --> 01:57:04,710
Boom. I do it. And um, you know,

1970
01:57:04,740 --> 01:57:08,430
had to show him what up nonetheless
that was done with those kettlebells,

1971
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:11,310
which are dealt by the way.
Um,

1972
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:16,620
I'm not gonna say get the designer ones.
I'm not gonna say that.

1973
01:57:17,010 --> 01:57:20,040
I think you should,
but I'm not going to say to do that.

1974
01:57:20,220 --> 01:57:24,960
I say go on there on
it.com/jocko check it out.

1975

Keep your workout interesting.

1979
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:40,560
If you care about your workout
to being interesting, unlike

1980
01:57:41,980 --> 01:57:45,580
Jocko Jocko, do they care
about that stuff? Um,

1981
01:57:45,581 --> 01:57:49,720
don't get addicted to the
interesting information like I did.

1982
01:57:50,230 --> 01:57:53,950
I think I'm past that addiction now. But
um, you know, you do run that risk on it.

1983
01:57:54,010 --> 01:57:56,110
Dotcom. Slash. Chocolate,
that's a good one. Also,

1984
01:57:56,890 --> 01:58:01,060
good way to support is when you're
buying these books that Jocko reviews.

01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:10,660

1993
01:58:34,361 --> 01:58:38,350
braking on the plane, when you check your

1996
01:58:49,650 --> 01:58:52,830
It seems like an opportune time to
talk about your other video camera.

1997
01:58:54,010 --> 01:58:57,850
Sure. Oh yeah. Yeah.
Or maybe not actually,

1998
01:58:57,851 --> 01:59:01,000
it's a good story though.
It's not like a tragic story,

1999
01:59:01,210 --> 01:59:03,430
which it kind of felt like when
you mentioned it, I was like, oh,

2000
01:59:03,431 --> 01:59:08,380
it brought me back. Okay.
So here's the story.

2001
01:59:10,900 --> 01:59:15,490
We go to Maine, right? Technically we
go to Boston, then drive to me. Yup.

2002
01:59:15,820 --> 01:59:19,710
Right. So, you know, dude, too drunk to
drive to you when we rent a car. Well,

2003
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:25,030
the car rental place and I have three
bags. Will you have what? One, two, yeah.

2004
01:59:25,031 --> 01:59:28,780
Two bags. Vessel, five bags. Total
cuter bag and my suitcase. Yeah,

2005
01:59:28,870 --> 01:59:31,900
so five bags total.
I have a big bag with equipment in it,

2006
01:59:33,170 --> 01:59:36,950
suitcase with, you know, did you just
see stuff and clothes and whatnot.

2007
01:59:37,190 --> 01:59:41,120
And then the third bag, which was the
carry on bit pretty big, you know,

2008
01:59:41,150 --> 01:59:44,120
most important was important.
Has a um,

2009
01:59:44,220 --> 01:59:47,930
it has an important camera
in there that I use. My,

2010
01:59:48,410 --> 01:59:51,660
my favorite camera I've ever
had really good camera. Uh,

2011
01:59:52,290 --> 01:59:56,030
has some value to it will say.
And it's a red camera. Yeah, it's

2012
01:59:57,770 --> 02:00:02,510
epic. W technically it's,
it's an awesome camera.

2013
02:00:03,140 --> 02:00:05,780
Is it the best you can buy or is there
one more? It depends on what you mean,

2014
02:00:05,781 --> 02:00:10,460
but best. But it's, yeah, there's one sort
of level. Okay. Well I'll tell you this,

2015
02:00:10,461 --> 02:00:12,830
it ain't cheap. No, it ain't cheap at all.

2016
02:00:13,190 --> 02:00:16,190
In some places in the country you could
buy a house for the cost of this camera.

2017
02:00:16,220 --> 02:00:20,720
Yeah. So it's an expensive camera.
Yeah. And, and you'd think like, okay,

2018
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:24,110
echo is going to take really good care
of this stuff, which I do. Really,

2019
02:00:24,111 --> 02:00:26,250
that's what I carry it
on. Boom, boom. You know,

2020
02:00:26,260 --> 02:00:28,910
doesn't even trust anyone touching it.
Cause going to carry it with them. Yeah.

2021
02:00:28,940 --> 02:00:33,050
Okay. Continue. So boom, we
hit in the rental car, we
got apparently got five bags,

2022
02:00:33,051 --> 02:00:36,290
still count for a was there, there was
no, there was some kind of confusion.

2023
02:00:36,291 --> 02:00:38,450
You know what happened? Yes,
there was. Yes. Remember,

2024
02:00:38,460 --> 02:00:40,340
because remember when you were getting in,
what was it,

2025
02:00:40,341 --> 02:00:42,110
like an expedition or something like that.

2026
02:00:42,290 --> 02:00:47,290
And now those new ones have that automatic
tail door that goes up and you know

2027
02:00:47,511 --> 02:00:48,320
what it was,

2028
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:52,250
I think there's like a sensor under the
bumper that if you like put your foot

2029
02:00:52,251 --> 02:00:54,250
under there, it closes. Like if you know,

2030
02:00:54,260 --> 02:00:56,390
like a hands free closing
the door situation.

2031
02:00:56,391 --> 02:00:59,930
So the thing started closing all
the main Dako yeah. And the girl,

2032
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:04,490
the rental girl was trying to save
me. Yeah. And she couldn't. Yeah.

2033
02:01:04,550 --> 02:01:05,960
So he always like be strong for her,

2034
02:01:05,961 --> 02:01:07,610
which was kind of funny
cause I didn't even care,

2035
02:01:07,940 --> 02:01:10,550
but I just kind of like put
my back into it and stopped.

2036
02:01:10,551 --> 02:01:13,340
But I was watching her kind of chuckling
because she's trying to stop it and it

2037
02:01:13,341 --> 02:01:15,250
wasn't stopping. It was, she was looking,

2038
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:17,240
she had a look on her face
like I was about to die.

2039
02:01:17,870 --> 02:01:20,390
She tried to work up like Indiana Jones.

2040
02:01:20,391 --> 02:01:24,230
I was going to get my head cut off by the
door slamming shut and I was just kind

2041
02:01:24,231 --> 02:01:27,710
of like laughing at the whole situation.
But that caused some confusion.

2042
02:01:27,711 --> 02:01:29,090
Apparently it was like your mind,

2043
02:01:29,120 --> 02:01:33,080
it was like a little micro emergency
that happened and so I was like boom,

2044
02:01:33,081 --> 02:01:36,770
flustered but wait what all the bags
are in or not and we're trying to fit.

2045
02:01:36,771 --> 02:01:39,560
Remember cause we were trying
to get the seats down the way.

2046
02:01:39,570 --> 02:01:44,570
There's like maybe three quads I
major things going on now and you know

2047
02:01:48,260 --> 02:01:51,560
for the sake story I'm just going to
continue. So bull, we get it all, all,

2048
02:01:53,090 --> 02:01:58,090
we get it all loaded and at one point
like we're like halfway up there's a three

2049
02:01:58,761 --> 02:02:01,400
hour drive and by the way if
we don't stop and we did stop.

2050
02:02:01,401 --> 02:02:02,810
So it was like five hours
or something like that.

2051
02:02:02,930 --> 02:02:05,600
So we stopped and I remember his
daughter got fried chicken by the way.

2052
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,790
It was good

2053
02:02:10,370 --> 02:02:12,020
and I was stoked nonetheless.

2054
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:17,000
I had a thought and it was literally
lasted three seconds. Like,

2055
02:02:17,030 --> 02:02:21,110
I don't really remember putting my
camera bag in the car, but what am,

2056
02:02:21,111 --> 02:02:24,980
I do not put it in the car. It's like
the most important back. So whatever.

2057
02:02:24,981 --> 02:02:26,000
So we just continue,

2058
02:02:26,001 --> 02:02:31,001
we get up there and right as we pull
into like park tied seconds later,

2059
02:02:31,290 --> 02:02:34,450
we're in the back country of Maine.
Yeah.

2060
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:37,790
Like not even knowing first
time there by the way,

2061
02:02:37,820 --> 02:02:39,500
which I dunno what that even means,

2062
02:02:39,501 --> 02:02:44,490
but either way we're there and
I'm all pumped up cause my rib,

2063
02:02:44,491 --> 02:02:47,810
I was stoked to go in and see everybody
and hang out. Yeah. You can see everyone.

2064
02:02:48,260 --> 02:02:52,370
Everyone's inside the light of the gym so
they can't see that were outside. Yeah.

2065
02:02:52,430 --> 02:02:53,930
So I'm all but I'm stoked. So it's, yeah,

2066
02:02:53,931 --> 02:02:58,100
the beginning of the deal can
finisher if you will. And um,

2067
02:02:58,130 --> 02:03:01,620
right as we kind of rolled to a stop,
I'm thinking, man, did I, you know,

2068
02:03:01,630 --> 02:03:04,100
he kind of account we're here and
now you start to account for it.

2069
02:03:04,310 --> 02:03:06,260
And I don't remember that stuff.
So the first thing you can do,

2070
02:03:06,261 --> 02:03:10,100
I look in the backseat cause that's
where it would've went. Not there.

2071
02:03:10,390 --> 02:03:12,220
And I look in the back,
not there and you know,

2072
02:03:12,240 --> 02:03:16,520
you get that cold feeling that just
rushes over your body. I go, oh my God.

2073
02:03:17,210 --> 02:03:21,740
So I'm like, man, so whatever I tell
you and you're like, whoa. You know,

2074
02:03:21,770 --> 02:03:23,690
get on the phone, you know,
call the airport and Bra.

2075
02:03:23,691 --> 02:03:26,620
You ever tried to call him the
airport or something? Yeah,

2076
02:03:26,780 --> 02:03:29,990
I told you this afterwards. My
opinion was at that point, divers,

2077
02:03:30,250 --> 02:03:31,850
that thing's gone.
100% gone,

2078
02:03:32,390 --> 02:03:36,380
gone 99.9999% you're never
going to see that thing again.

2079
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:40,460
I had already cut it away emotionally
and detached from it and I was kind of

2080
02:03:40,461 --> 02:03:44,210
thrown you bones like yeah, call the
airport, maybe they can help you.

2081
02:03:44,330 --> 02:03:47,870
That was actually nice of you because
you really, you seem like you care.

2082
02:03:47,900 --> 02:03:50,560
Not necessarily about the
Karen necessarily, but you
cared about me. You know,

2083
02:03:50,570 --> 02:03:52,430
like early fan.
I thought that thing was gone.

2084
02:03:52,431 --> 02:03:55,460
There's no chance of getting it back,
get over it. And I was a little bit,

2085
02:03:55,480 --> 02:03:56,241
well I said,
you know,

2086
02:03:56,241 --> 02:04:00,590
is there podcast recorded that you don't
have copies of on there? And you said,

2087
02:04:00,591 --> 02:04:03,090
no, they're all uploaded.
I'll say, good thing. Awesome.

2088
02:04:03,930 --> 02:04:06,470
Cause we're never going to see that
thing again. And I was thinking,

2089
02:04:06,471 --> 02:04:08,540
I'll see it again in three months,

2090
02:04:08,541 --> 02:04:11,330
maybe when they finally
recover it from Austin,

2091
02:04:11,331 --> 02:04:13,280
found from the Boston airport by the way.

2092
02:04:15,050 --> 02:04:19,100
Or I get my insurance money for down
the line and then you got to go read,

2093
02:04:19,670 --> 02:04:22,100
go through the purchase process,
which is a thing,

2094
02:04:22,870 --> 02:04:25,070
but we don't have it
for this trip for sure.

2095
02:04:25,460 --> 02:04:30,460
And later on I found out or realized that
we have the podcasts like SD cards in

2096
02:04:30,831 --> 02:04:33,230
there. So while we, I guess we
could have just bought some anyway,

2097
02:04:33,290 --> 02:04:37,530
nonetheless we get there and I'm calling
the airport and right on the airport

2098
02:04:37,890 --> 02:04:42,330
recording picks up. Yeah. Just
get this feeling like, oh my gosh,

2099
02:04:42,331 --> 02:04:44,280
I'm just completely going
through the motions right now.

2100
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:46,850
No one's going to pick up and be like,
sure, I'll look for it. Yeah, I got it.

2101
02:04:46,851 --> 02:04:50,520
And no one, that's not going to happen.
But I keep calling and I'm like,

2102
02:04:50,521 --> 02:04:52,530
I'm not going to be the guy
who didn't do everything I can.

2103
02:04:52,531 --> 02:04:55,740
So I'm calling or whatever. Meanwhile,
we got to go talk to Pete, we got to,

2104
02:04:55,741 --> 02:04:57,960
you know, all this stuff that
you released me. You go, hey man,

2105
02:04:57,961 --> 02:05:00,410
go ahead and make these calls. And I was
like, okay, cool. You hang out with that.

2106
02:05:00,411 --> 02:05:03,920
Just make us totally worthless effort
because you're never seeing that thing

2107
02:05:03,940 --> 02:05:07,270
again. I'll go hang out with people.
Yeah. So after like a few minutes of that,

2108
02:05:07,271 --> 02:05:12,180
I go in, I'm like, you know what, let me,
let me kind of cut it away and saying,

2109
02:05:12,210 --> 02:05:14,670
let me at least it embraced it.
You know what we're doing.

2110
02:05:15,090 --> 02:05:19,290
Go in and you kind of kind of
casually in a way mentioned like, hey,

2111
02:05:19,291 --> 02:05:23,970
there's some guys from the police. If
that came across casually, casually,

2112
02:05:24,120 --> 02:05:27,300
I shouldn't have made it come work
because I met a bunch of guys, you know,

2113
02:05:27,301 --> 02:05:30,020
everyone was just saying hi. And a couple
of guys are, you know, yeah, we're,

2114
02:05:30,030 --> 02:05:35,030
we're cops and [inaudible]
down in Massachusetts and
right by boss to go right

2115
02:05:35,161 --> 02:05:36,130
next to it.
And,

2116
02:05:36,740 --> 02:05:41,740
and I met them and then you stroll
back in and you met a couple people.

2117
02:05:42,420 --> 02:05:44,610
And then I said, you talked
to anybody. Well, yeah,

2118
02:05:44,611 --> 02:05:46,890
I talked to this and they're
going to look whatever.

2119
02:05:46,950 --> 02:05:48,990
I'm thinking you have things
gone. And I said, you know,

2120
02:05:48,991 --> 02:05:52,560
if there's anyone in the world that could
like make something happen right now

2121
02:05:53,250 --> 02:05:57,120
it's cops. Yeah. So
it's, it's Boston cops.

2122
02:05:57,180 --> 02:06:01,350
Ravinia cops and what? And,
and I just said, I said, bro.

2123
02:06:01,620 --> 02:06:06,240
And I was a little, this is my
ego. I was embarrassed for you.

2124
02:06:06,690 --> 02:06:10,830
I felt bad that you had to go and tell
somebody that you lost this. Yeah.

2125
02:06:11,430 --> 02:06:16,290
Sick camera. And so I just said, hey
man, those guys over there, they're cops.

2126
02:06:16,350 --> 02:06:19,230
And if there's anyone that gets going
to get this thing back, it's them. Yeah.

2127
02:06:19,350 --> 02:06:23,430
And I'm thinking, you know,
the whole story where like,

2128
02:06:24,060 --> 02:06:27,360
did you see this? So did you not think
that they were going to be able to help?

2129
02:06:27,420 --> 02:06:30,870
I thought that they'd be
like, Oh, you lost your bag.

2130
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:35,040
Like everyone does every single day
at that airport. Oh, we're cops, bro.

2131
02:06:35,041 --> 02:06:38,910
We have crimes to solve.
Yeah, no, I get your stupid.

2132
02:06:38,911 --> 02:06:41,700
My attitude of that thing
being gone actually changed.

2133
02:06:41,701 --> 02:06:44,680
As soon as I connected it and said to
myself, oh they're cops, we're going to,

2134
02:06:44,700 --> 02:06:47,340
we're going to turn this over to them and
they can make things happen that, that,

2135
02:06:47,700 --> 02:06:50,730
that's good. And Youth and
even me when I was like, okay,

2136
02:06:50,731 --> 02:06:53,980
I'm going to mention it to these cops
and these cops are going to be like diva,

2137
02:06:53,990 --> 02:06:56,300
like what do you, what do you
think our job is? You know,

2138
02:06:56,400 --> 02:07:00,850
to go recover your lost luggage. He's
like w three hours away by the way. No.

2139
02:07:00,870 --> 02:07:03,780
So I'm like, you know what Jocko said
to do it, I'm just going to do it.

2140
02:07:03,781 --> 02:07:05,370
This is another go
through the motions thing.

2141
02:07:05,820 --> 02:07:10,200
So I kind of timidly go Dennis and Nate,
they were there,

2142
02:07:10,420 --> 02:07:14,280
they just rolled it, whatever. And
I was like, Hey, I lost the bet.

2143
02:07:14,281 --> 02:07:17,130
And they were like, what did it look
like? Like they kind of were into it.

2144
02:07:17,131 --> 02:07:19,590
I was like, oh this is promising,
you know, like they actually care.

2145
02:07:19,591 --> 02:07:22,230
Cause I was thinking they'd be like,
man, that's a sad story. Broke.

2146
02:07:22,290 --> 02:07:24,420
I'm going to go talk to Jocko
again, you know, kind of thing.

2147
02:07:24,421 --> 02:07:28,050
I thought that was going to
happen. And they were like, no bro.

2148
02:07:28,051 --> 02:07:30,780
They get on the phone and they're
like, what'd it look like? Boom.

2149
02:07:30,870 --> 02:07:33,330
One more question like, Oh, where are
you? Where'd you leave it? Okay, boom,

2150
02:07:33,331 --> 02:07:36,040
back on the phone, back on the
phone. These two guys, I'm like,

2151
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:39,520
oh this is, it's starting to kind
of look up. And he's like, okay.

2152
02:07:39,610 --> 02:07:41,350
So they hang up the phone. He
was like, just a waiting game.

2153
02:07:41,351 --> 02:07:44,460
Now just a matter of time I got this,
I got this guy and I'm like thrilled.

2154
02:07:44,461 --> 02:07:47,300
They're like, yeah man, just the waiting
game. So we're talking called it.

2155
02:07:47,380 --> 02:07:50,980
They called all their bros is out there
and there was like a force of troopers

2156
02:07:50,990 --> 02:07:55,660
from my daughter to get in there. Had
that thing recovered in what, 20 minutes,

2157
02:07:55,661 --> 02:07:59,290
how many minutes? They hang up and
they're like, just amount of time bro.

2158
02:07:59,350 --> 02:08:01,980
And then we just start talking
about other stuff. Yeah. You know,

2159
02:08:01,990 --> 02:08:05,320
kind of teasing me a little bit, whatever.
I deserve it and I'll even 10 times up.

2160
02:08:05,321 --> 02:08:08,830
But, and then we were talking about other
stuff. Boom. His phone rings, he's on it.

2161
02:08:08,831 --> 02:08:12,160
He's like, is it of mine? Shift bit
bag and all this and describing it,

2162
02:08:12,161 --> 02:08:14,860
I don't even know. That's how I'd
have to, I'm like, yeah, I think so.

2163
02:08:15,190 --> 02:08:18,640
Go inside and needs any,
any bus up my laptop or whatever.

2164
02:08:18,641 --> 02:08:21,550
It's matching the description
and in my mind I'm like,

2165
02:08:21,551 --> 02:08:22,870
there's no way he found it.

2166
02:08:23,170 --> 02:08:27,760
Like a cop's not going to just roll
into the Logan Airport and find my bag.

2167
02:08:27,790 --> 02:08:30,790
No way that's going to happen. But it
happens. Sure enough, he's like, Oh,

2168
02:08:30,791 --> 02:08:35,170
you're a fragment cause it has a fragment
sticker on my laptop. And he's like,

2169
02:08:35,171 --> 02:08:36,550
frag mobile like that.

2170
02:08:36,551 --> 02:08:41,440
We'll pull the feeling turned into just
warmth and love and rainbows on this guy.

2171
02:08:41,441 --> 02:08:44,020
I was like, that's the one they're
like, and you know, they're kind of,

2172
02:08:44,170 --> 02:08:47,080
they didn't actually high
five, but they're kind of
like almost like, you know,

2173
02:08:47,081 --> 02:08:48,290
this was this little tasks.

2174
02:08:48,291 --> 02:08:50,990
They kind of bonded over that and
just like that morning minutes, man

2175
02:08:53,340 --> 02:08:57,770
who drove it up? Um, Robbie,
that's his name, right Ravi.

2176
02:08:57,960 --> 02:09:01,930
Yeah. I owe him a role. Um,
actually there was another guy,

2177
02:09:01,960 --> 02:09:04,360
Callahan who was the guy
who went and grabbed,

2178
02:09:04,361 --> 02:09:08,570
so he was like a coordinated
dealmaker and um,

2179
02:09:08,730 --> 02:09:13,180
man does like one of the more heroic
things that has happened to me and in the

2180
02:09:13,181 --> 02:09:16,180
recent past.
So you've got the camera back,

2181
02:09:16,181 --> 02:09:19,720
got the camera behind the computer
and we're good. So in the event,

2182
02:09:19,721 --> 02:09:22,930
so the point is in the event
of you shopping for cameras
can get a red camera on

2183
02:09:22,931 --> 02:09:23,530
Amazon,

2184
02:09:23,530 --> 02:09:28,180
but if you want to get like a Sony HD
handicap or whatever you're using because

2185
02:09:28,181 --> 02:09:30,670
it broke in the luggage.
I'm not saying that happened to me,

2186
02:09:30,671 --> 02:09:32,830
I'm just saying if that ever happened
to you and to get another one, boom,

2187
02:09:32,831 --> 02:09:37,670
you can go through their Jocko store.com
click through and thanks to everyone to

2188
02:09:37,671 --> 02:09:40,570
cut that camera back.
Yeah, much appreciated.

2189
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:44,680
And the laptop with all kinds of
videos and important stuff on it. Yeah.

2190
02:09:44,830 --> 02:09:49,750
Actually those guys are on the laptop
but, but yeah, man Dennison, Nate,

2191
02:09:49,780 --> 02:09:52,090
the primary guys,
Mr. Callahan,

2192
02:09:52,120 --> 02:09:56,620
I didn't meet him but he's
done because he recovered that.

2193
02:09:56,621 --> 02:10:01,420
And then Robbie, I owe you a role. Oh
you two rules. I owe you a lot, man.

2194
02:10:01,640 --> 02:10:05,350
You the man, he's the one who delivered
it so big up to all of them. Big Time.

2195
02:10:06,910 --> 02:10:10,540
So also back to support of Jocko podcast,

2196
02:10:11,350 --> 02:10:15,010
subscribe to the podcast,
iTunes, stitcher, Google play.

2197
02:10:15,070 --> 02:10:18,490
It's a good way to support kind of kind
of kind of obvious like oh yeah you

2198
02:10:18,491 --> 02:10:20,440
subscribed already. But some
people, maybe they didn't.

2199
02:10:20,470 --> 02:10:23,050
Maybe they were just kind of maybe
wish not wishy washy but you know,

2200
02:10:23,051 --> 02:10:26,820
kind of still on the fence.
But man do it well at your,

2201
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:29,440
you can unsubscribe if
we're not delivering value.

2202
02:10:29,530 --> 02:10:33,710
I don't like to use that
expression. Adding value.
Everyone uses thinks it's cool.

2203
02:10:33,830 --> 02:10:34,130
I thought

2204
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:37,940
it was cool the, if we're not adding
value, you cannot subscribe if you want.

2205
02:10:39,050 --> 02:10:41,420
Also subscribe on Youtube.

2206
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:45,710
What's the recent development?
Oh your book.

2207
02:10:47,150 --> 02:10:51,800
Dismissible field manual field manual,
which she'll talk about later.

2208
02:10:52,790 --> 02:10:55,310
We put a video on there.
It kind of little summary.

2209
02:10:56,300 --> 02:10:59,330
I was real excited to see
that video come out. Yeah.

2210
02:10:59,450 --> 02:11:03,230
And I was, we, you know,

2211
02:11:03,231 --> 02:11:06,040
we were texting back and forth and he
said, well, how about, you know, we will,

2212
02:11:06,170 --> 02:11:09,760
I'll put it out tomorrow, but it's ready.
And I said, just put it out now. Yeah,

2213
02:11:09,770 --> 02:11:13,010
yeah, yeah. Late. Then you
said launching in three,

2214
02:11:13,670 --> 02:11:15,530
two and then there was,

2215
02:11:15,531 --> 02:11:19,910
and I went to my youtube on my phone
and I was refreshing, refreshing,

2216
02:11:20,060 --> 02:11:22,070
refreshing, refreshing, refreshing.

2217
02:11:22,220 --> 02:11:25,310
And I wanted to catch it like the first
person to catch it. I'm refreshing,

2218
02:11:25,340 --> 02:11:27,110
refreshing.
And this happened,

2219
02:11:28,310 --> 02:11:33,310
I got a ping from my mail on my phone
and I switched to mail and it said Jocko

2220
02:11:34,281 --> 02:11:35,960
podcast is upload a new video.

2221
02:11:37,280 --> 02:11:41,420
So that's one of the benefits of
subscribing to the youtube channel.

2222
02:11:41,510 --> 02:11:44,380
If something comes out, you can
have it email you if you want it to,

2223
02:11:44,430 --> 02:11:44,991
if you can have it,

2224
02:11:44,991 --> 02:11:48,170
email you when something new comes out
and otherwise there's no way you'd know.

2225
02:11:48,530 --> 02:11:52,160
Yeah. So if you, if you care about
they 10 stuff, which you know,

2226
02:11:52,220 --> 02:11:54,230
it's one of those deals where, yeah, sure,

2227
02:11:54,231 --> 02:11:58,160
you get the video version of the podcast.
If you care what we look like,

2228
02:11:58,730 --> 02:12:01,220
you just fine. Actually, people
will play it on their TV,

2229
02:12:01,221 --> 02:12:04,370
like in their little home gym or
something like that, which was cool.

2230
02:12:04,371 --> 02:12:07,690
It's kind of like we're all there
together, you know? Um, and then, yeah,

2231
02:12:07,710 --> 02:12:11,450
some excerpts in there. The video
that you made for the book. Yeah.

2232
02:12:11,540 --> 02:12:16,190
I think it might be your best video ever.
It might be. I think it's up there man.

2233
02:12:16,220 --> 02:12:18,530
I was, yeah, I was
talking. It's real good.

2234
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:23,720
I'll talk to somebody on face book and
they're like, oh hey, that video was cool.

2235
02:12:24,410 --> 02:12:27,290
And I thought about saying like, oh,
that was like, you man. Thanks for that.

2236
02:12:27,291 --> 02:12:31,190
But I thought about it. It's like, wait,
Jocko kind of did all the work. Really.

2237
02:12:31,340 --> 02:12:34,460
You know, you're the one working out your
word that you saying the words I said,

2238
02:12:34,461 --> 02:12:38,080
all I did was put some cool music
and some words on there. They'd,

2239
02:12:38,180 --> 02:12:39,640
all that other stuff happened in there.

2240
02:12:39,650 --> 02:12:42,530
The words and the way it's all
coordinated together and all that stuff.

2241
02:12:42,531 --> 02:12:46,450
So I have two lights on there nonetheless.
You know what, I'm to be honest. Um,

2242
02:12:46,460 --> 02:12:50,840
I like how it came out too. He was good.
He's theory, they're getting the best one.

2243
02:12:51,180 --> 02:12:54,310
Hey men. You know, it depends on what
you mean by best, you know, I dunno.

2244
02:12:54,380 --> 02:12:59,270
Impactful and then back. Well sure.
That's a good one. I liked it. Yeah.

2245
02:12:59,330 --> 02:13:03,020
It was, if someone wasn't subscribed to
the youtube channel, yeah. They might not,

2246
02:13:03,021 --> 02:13:05,800
never know that that video exists.
That's true. And that that's,

2247
02:13:05,810 --> 02:13:10,550
that hurts or no Facebook or
no Twitter or no, nothing.

2248
02:13:10,750 --> 02:13:15,320
Yeah. Yeah. So choose your, your, your
wealth that I tweeted that one out,

2249
02:13:15,321 --> 02:13:18,560
but I don't always tweet out
when something comes out.
Yeah, yeah, that's true. No.

2250
02:13:18,850 --> 02:13:21,920
Yeah, don't always do that.
Sure. So if you subscribe,

2251
02:13:21,921 --> 02:13:25,640
you'll know regardless of what my
actions are. That's true. And you know,

2252
02:13:25,670 --> 02:13:27,080
choose whether or not you want an alert.
You know,

2253
02:13:27,081 --> 02:13:30,500
sometimes you don't want that alert
every single time, but sometimes you do.

2254
02:13:30,650 --> 02:13:32,070
You know,
I'll put

2255
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:35,280
some deleted scenes on there
as well. Anyway. Nonetheless.
Yeah. Youtube channel,

2256
02:13:35,281 --> 02:13:39,930
we have one and it's cool. I think
it's cool. Juggle things at school law.

2257
02:13:40,170 --> 02:13:43,800
I just got a little thing. Youtube
kind of changed their look on Youtube.

2258
02:13:43,801 --> 02:13:44,700
I don't know if you notice that.

2259
02:13:45,180 --> 02:13:49,220
It's hard for me to judge because
I have youtube red now. No ads,

2260
02:13:50,040 --> 02:13:54,120
so dope. Nonetheless, I liked the
ABS ads. Actually they did good.

2261
02:13:54,210 --> 02:13:56,430
A good thing with the ads now.
Now you can click like,

2262
02:13:56,580 --> 02:14:01,440
I don't like this ad or you can give
that so you can kind of narrow down the

2263
02:14:01,441 --> 02:14:04,500
ads. You See, I liked
the movie trailer ads.

2264
02:14:04,590 --> 02:14:07,450
You know like I don't like in the ads.
Yeah,

2265
02:14:07,460 --> 02:14:11,040
I did watch what I want to watch everyone
else get away from me. Yeah, yeah.

2266
02:14:11,041 --> 02:14:14,700
I dig it. I dig it fully. Oh
nonetheless, the point there is subside.

2267
02:14:14,760 --> 02:14:19,410
Subscribe to the Youtube Channel is a
good way of supporting the podcast if you

2268
02:14:19,411 --> 02:14:23,850
want to. Also Jocko was a
store. It's called Jocko store,

2269
02:14:25,050 --> 02:14:29,960
Jocko store.com. Of course.
Very creative name by the way.

2270
02:14:29,970 --> 02:14:32,610
I guess technically I came up with a name.
You did.

2271
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:38,100
This store is your storage chocolate
store. I concurred with the name. Yeah,

2272
02:14:38,490 --> 02:14:41,100
so what do we have on the store?
If you don't know already,

2273
02:14:41,340 --> 02:14:45,570
we've got shirts on their
rash, guards, travel mugs,

2274
02:14:45,690 --> 02:14:49,920
some bumper stickers, patches, hats,

2275
02:14:50,010 --> 02:14:53,190
ball cap hats. Not like, did
you remind today top hats?

2276
02:14:53,220 --> 02:14:57,440
You don't look like you did.
Yeah. No I did. And Harris Servo.

2277
02:14:57,570 --> 02:15:02,430
You want me nine?
None the less they're on there.

2278
02:15:02,460 --> 02:15:03,211
Jocko.
xero.com.

2279
02:15:03,211 --> 02:15:07,620
I guess technically you could go to your
own story and get a hat or nine hats as

2280
02:15:07,621 --> 02:15:10,710
the case may be. I'll do that today.
Thank you. I appreciate it. If you want,

2281
02:15:10,711 --> 02:15:13,890
if you want to, um, so women's
stuff on there. Some hoodies,

2282
02:15:14,130 --> 02:15:15,990
we want to get a thicker hoodie.
That's what we're doing, right.

2283
02:15:16,200 --> 02:15:20,910
I know you said it a bunch
of times, but um, yeah,

2284
02:15:20,970 --> 02:15:23,560
we'll work on that. So
there, boom, hoodies. Uh,

2285
02:15:27,210 --> 02:15:30,360
I think
what,

2286
02:15:30,570 --> 02:15:35,190
what's the next move? What's
the next thing? Winter Hoodie.

2287
02:15:35,370 --> 02:15:37,470
Winter Hoodie. Yeah. Yeah.
I think it should be.

2288
02:15:38,100 --> 02:15:42,050
I think I'm going to put a warrior
kid rash guard on there too, for four.

2289
02:15:42,060 --> 02:15:44,480
Where he kids doing no Guid
Jujitsu or even, gee, you know,

2290
02:15:44,510 --> 02:15:47,130
you were the RushCard under the
east sometimes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2291
02:15:47,400 --> 02:15:51,090
I think that'd be dope stuff nonetheless.
Jackals store,

2292
02:15:51,091 --> 02:15:55,650
that's where you get Jocko stuff.
It's pretty cool.

2293
02:15:56,190 --> 02:15:59,130
So I'm not saying to buy something.
I'm saying go on there, check it out.

2294
02:15:59,160 --> 02:16:03,350
If you like something,
get something good way to support all.

2295
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:06,720
So psychological warfare,
if you didn't know what that is,

2296
02:16:07,440 --> 02:16:11,370
it is an album with tracks,
Jocko checks,

2297
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:16,560
Jocko saying stuff to you. So if you
listen to it, it's not like a story,

2298
02:16:17,220 --> 02:16:20,700
right? Like, you know, a lot of
times it's not music, obviously.

2299
02:16:20,701 --> 02:16:22,110
It's not Jocko singing hardcore,

2300
02:16:22,500 --> 02:16:25,340
which you do from time to
time by the way he ever ride.

2301
02:16:25,800 --> 02:16:30,000
And here's a kind of a
rhetorical question. Kay, have
you ever written you Jocko,

2302
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:33,790
but the people out there, have you
ever written with Jocko for five hour,

2303
02:16:33,800 --> 02:16:38,350
three to five hours in a car? No.
Okay. Let me tell you what it's like.

2304
02:16:38,860 --> 02:16:43,690
Part of what it's like, it's Jocko
drumming even in the airplane by the way.

2305
02:16:43,780 --> 02:16:45,490
Drumming on,
what do you call that?

2306
02:16:45,491 --> 02:16:49,420
The handle in the door and like you're
doing like drums bump and then singing

2307
02:16:49,421 --> 02:16:52,780
under his breath. Hardcore stuff.
Um, what else are you seeing?

2308
02:16:53,260 --> 02:16:55,660
What are you looking? Was like Tom
Petty or say it wasn't Tom Petty.

2309
02:16:55,661 --> 02:16:59,380
It was something anyway. I have no
idea. Yeah, but it was songs I was,

2310
02:16:59,390 --> 02:17:01,720
I noticed occasionally I'd look
at you and you'd be looking like,

2311
02:17:01,960 --> 02:17:05,860
can you please stop? Yeah, yeah. Which I
got a kick out of me. Yeah, you were born.

2312
02:17:06,610 --> 02:17:11,140
Yeah. Or, or stop the car and like get out
or something. Yeah. You get out and walk.

2313
02:17:11,220 --> 02:17:16,030
Yeah. Million drums. That was the
look for sure. Yeah. Wait, no,

2314
02:17:16,450 --> 02:17:20,530
you get out. Stop playing drums and get
out. That was the look. Nonetheless,

2315
02:17:21,070 --> 02:17:23,740
these tracks are not that they're him,

2316
02:17:24,250 --> 02:17:26,350
him [inaudible] talking to you,

2317
02:17:26,950 --> 02:17:31,900
telling you pragmatic ways
to get over your current
weakness. What? Weakness. Okay,

2318
02:17:31,901 --> 02:17:34,720
so let's say you're trying to
stick to a good diet, right?

2319
02:17:35,620 --> 02:17:39,160
Try to wake up early or all of the above.
Right at this moment.

2320
02:17:39,161 --> 02:17:43,290
Actually currently 48 hours
right now. Currently. Yeah.

2321
02:17:43,900 --> 02:17:44,710
Feeling good too.

2322
02:17:44,710 --> 02:17:47,110
I guess technically I'm fascinating
too because they ate a salad.

2323
02:17:47,960 --> 02:17:52,180
Oh hardcore workouts or yesterday
and today rolled last night,

2324
02:17:52,300 --> 02:17:54,850
70% ribs a little tweaked still.

2325
02:17:54,970 --> 02:17:59,890
But Andy Dean light roles
a little bit with Nam.

2326
02:18:00,970 --> 02:18:05,140
I think that was it. But yeah, no
listing the whole time. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2327
02:18:05,950 --> 02:18:07,390
Yep.
So technically,

2328
02:18:07,391 --> 02:18:11,350
am I fascinating if I ate a
salad at like 1145 last night?

2329
02:18:11,680 --> 02:18:16,240
Well he knows it and drank
some coffee. Yeah. Fast, fast,

2330
02:18:16,241 --> 02:18:20,810
24 hour fast. No, no. Oh, 12
hour fast fasting. Got It.

2331
02:18:21,850 --> 02:18:25,630
Is there such thing as an eight hour fast?
I think that's just life.

2332
02:18:27,310 --> 02:18:29,650
I think it's like four and a half.
If you're not doing,

2333
02:18:29,950 --> 02:18:34,720
if you're not doing at least 12 hours,
12 hours is the cutoff for calling Nicole.

2334
02:18:35,110 --> 02:18:36,480
I don't know what to cut off the steering.

2335
02:18:36,520 --> 02:18:40,390
I'm not a doctor or even a nutrition goal.
You're fasting right now currently.

2336
02:18:41,020 --> 02:18:44,890
What if like you just didn't eat yet,
whatever, and I just didn't eat yet.

2337
02:18:44,950 --> 02:18:48,400
There's a difference. Yo. So what's
the difference? That's the question.

2338
02:18:48,430 --> 02:18:51,010
I don't know. Hey, you're,
you're a man of humility.

2339
02:18:51,011 --> 02:18:53,230
You say you didn't know and you
to know. I like that. Nonetheless.

2340
02:18:53,231 --> 02:18:54,400
Back to the psychological warfare.

2341
02:18:54,670 --> 02:18:59,380
If you're trying to stay on the
fast or wake up early every morning,

2342
02:18:59,530 --> 02:19:01,720
you know,
or stick to the Diet,

2343
02:19:03,610 --> 02:19:05,650
stay in the program,
whatever, in whatever way,

2344
02:19:05,680 --> 02:19:07,870
ways that you have opportunities to slip.

2345
02:19:09,880 --> 02:19:14,880
This is an album with tracks that tell
you why you shouldn't slip on your waking

2346
02:19:15,581 --> 02:19:19,540
up early, your diet, your working
out. My whole thing. You know,

2347
02:19:19,630 --> 02:19:22,270
like I've said before,
if I don't feel like working out,

2348
02:19:22,300 --> 02:19:25,210
I kind of tend to be like, oh, maybe
I'll rest today. Maybe I'll do it later.

2349
02:19:25,240 --> 02:19:28,100
You know, that whole thing,
not good. Yeah, this helps with

2350
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:31,510
that.
It'll just tell you like why it'll,

2351
02:19:31,550 --> 02:19:36,350
how in a nutshell tells you the benefits
of not slipping and the repercussions

2352
02:19:36,380 --> 02:19:38,570
of slipping.
That's in a pragmatic way,

2353
02:19:38,630 --> 02:19:42,050
but does Jocko telling it to you so it
works 100% of the time. My experience,

2354
02:19:42,170 --> 02:19:46,580
speaking of fasting, people ask me
this all the time, when you're fasting,

2355
02:19:46,670 --> 02:19:50,810
do you eat anything? Yeah, I
do actually. Sunflower seeds,

2356
02:19:50,840 --> 02:19:51,770
sunflower seeds,

2357
02:19:51,830 --> 02:19:55,730
because it takes you like 37 minutes
to have one little tiny seed to get it

2358
02:19:55,731 --> 02:19:57,920
chewed up in a so, right. But they're,

2359
02:19:57,950 --> 02:20:00,590
but they're good because they keep you
occupied and you're chewing and they

2360
02:20:00,591 --> 02:20:02,330
taste good and blah,
blah blah.

2361
02:20:03,020 --> 02:20:08,000
Sometimes I'll grab a handful of nuts,
just mixed nuts.

2362
02:20:08,030 --> 02:20:12,170
Just maybe one in the morning,
maybe one at night,

2363
02:20:12,740 --> 02:20:16,640
one handful and Jocko white tea.
Boom.

2364
02:20:16,790 --> 02:20:20,300
That's the things.
Now sometimes I won't eat the nuts,

2365
02:20:20,780 --> 02:20:23,840
but I dunno, I I, I'm

2366
02:20:26,280 --> 02:20:29,750
you gotta be careful that you don't
have 13 handfuls of nuts. Yeah.

2367
02:20:29,751 --> 02:20:33,050
Cause I was like, I'm just talking
like a handful of nuts. Right. Um,

2368
02:20:33,110 --> 02:20:37,250
but Jocko white tea, I have that
for sure. And you know what,

2369
02:20:37,340 --> 02:20:40,160
if you call me now or
you want to put like, oh,

2370
02:20:40,161 --> 02:20:43,130
you weren't really fast and because
you have Jocko white tea and you have a

2371
02:20:43,131 --> 02:20:44,600
handful of nuts.
I mean,

2372
02:20:44,601 --> 02:20:47,060
if you think about the amount of
calories that I burned on a daily basis,

2373
02:20:47,061 --> 02:20:50,930
a handful of nuts as basically
and insignificant, but whatever.

2374
02:20:50,931 --> 02:20:53,900
Maybe I'm doing it wrong. That's okay.
I'm just telling you what I'm doing.

2375
02:20:53,901 --> 02:20:57,620
I'm not telling you to do it. I'm not
telling you to copy what I'm doing.

2376
02:20:57,650 --> 02:21:00,020
I'm just telling you what I'm
doing right now. Don't imitate me.

2377
02:21:00,021 --> 02:21:01,880
Go find a professional
to talk about fasting.

2378
02:21:03,020 --> 02:21:05,750
I'm just telling you what I'm doing.
Jocko white tea. Let me tell you,

2379
02:21:05,751 --> 02:21:06,584
it tastes good.

2380
02:21:07,010 --> 02:21:12,010
It feels good and increases your
deadlift about 12 fold or so.

2381
02:21:14,750 --> 02:21:18,620
Yeah, so that's real good for you. You
can get it on Amazon. Also on Amazon,

2382
02:21:18,621 --> 02:21:21,500
you can get some books, extreme
ownership, combat leadership.

2383
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:25,430
I appreciate everyone that gets it for
themselves and then gets it for their

2384
02:21:25,431 --> 02:21:30,431
teams and sends pictures of 47
extreme ownership copies stacked up.

2385
02:21:30,980 --> 02:21:33,530
I got something else
for you that's awesome.

2386
02:21:33,700 --> 02:21:38,090
And get it for your business associates,
people that you work with,

2387
02:21:38,091 --> 02:21:39,410
but they're not in your company.

2388
02:21:40,010 --> 02:21:42,830
You get it for them and that's going to
improve everything in your world too,

2389
02:21:42,831 --> 02:21:45,380
because then they start taking ownership
of problems and everything gets better.

2390
02:21:45,440 --> 02:21:50,090
So I got, I've had a lot of
people that have said, hey,
I gave this to this person.

2391
02:21:50,091 --> 02:21:53,120
I gave this to this partner that I
used to have and now he's got his own

2392
02:21:53,121 --> 02:21:53,451
business,

2393
02:21:53,451 --> 02:21:57,020
but we're working together and I gave
him the book and now we're working

2394
02:21:57,021 --> 02:22:00,500
together even more. So there was a good
idea for you weigh the warrior kid.

2395
02:22:00,620 --> 02:22:02,000
This was awesome.
At the origin camp,

2396
02:22:02,001 --> 02:22:07,001
I'll bunch of people from all over the
northeast brought their kids up to to

2397
02:22:09,140 --> 02:22:13,430
meet, hang out, get a signature and all
that. And what's cool is what's cool.

2398
02:22:13,580 --> 02:22:17,600
Kids tell the truth, you know what I mean?
They don't even, they're not aware of,

2399
02:22:17,660 --> 02:22:22,390
they don't care about your feelings
at all. And it's awesome to, you know,

2400
02:22:22,400 --> 02:22:26,130
say I always say to Kiddo, did you
read that book? And they go, yes, I go,

2401
02:22:26,131 --> 02:22:30,570
how'd you like it? And they all
say, Oh, I love it. It's awesome.

2402
02:22:31,140 --> 02:22:33,870
And we know your Jocko and
thank you for writing it.

2403
02:22:35,100 --> 02:22:39,960
And those kids are getting stronger
and smarter and tougher and better.

2404
02:22:40,620 --> 02:22:45,450
Yeah. So you want to help out kids that
you know, get them this book right here,

2405
02:22:46,020 --> 02:22:51,000
discipline equals freedom field manual.
That's what it is. It's a field manual.

2406
02:22:51,001 --> 02:22:54,030
For those of you that don't know
what a field manuals in the military,

2407
02:22:54,031 --> 02:22:57,540
a field manual is. The instructions
on how to do something in the field,

2408
02:22:58,050 --> 02:23:03,050
whether it's attack a strong objective
or whether it's dual recognizance or how

2409
02:23:03,661 --> 02:23:05,010
to conduct a patrol.

2410
02:23:05,100 --> 02:23:08,940
The field manual gives you
the instructions on how
to do that and that's what

2411
02:23:08,941 --> 02:23:10,950
this is.
The discipline equals freedom.

2412
02:23:10,980 --> 02:23:15,750
Field manual is a field manual on how
to implement discipline into your life.

2413
02:23:16,110 --> 02:23:20,070
There's zero amount of fluff in here.
There's zero.

2414
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,730
There's nothing in there that you'd say
you're going to say to yourself, well,

2415
02:23:23,731 --> 02:23:26,010
I think Jocko might've just
thrown this in here for, you know,

2416
02:23:26,220 --> 02:23:29,940
kind of take up some space in the
pages. Didn't happen. Rather not do it.

2417
02:23:30,270 --> 02:23:34,860
Rather burn the whole book. Don't care
about that. The book's not long enough.

2418
02:23:34,861 --> 02:23:39,330
Cool. Read less. So that's what it is.

2419
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:41,970
Get it from your local bookstore.

2420
02:23:42,450 --> 02:23:47,450
So go down to the neighborhood bookstore
and tell him you want this book or you

2421
02:23:47,461 --> 02:23:52,350
can get it from Barnes Noble. You can get
it from Amazon. Let them know what's up.

2422
02:23:54,330 --> 02:23:58,890
It's in the get after it section of
your local bookstore. If they have one.

2423
02:23:58,891 --> 02:24:00,360
If they don't have that section,

2424
02:24:00,420 --> 02:24:04,710
they need it so they can put this one
book by itself in there getting after it.

2425
02:24:06,330 --> 02:24:10,260
Your video's awesome by the way.
Thanks John. For Your Business.

2426
02:24:10,261 --> 02:24:14,640
If you need help aligning your leadership
and improving the way that your whole

2427
02:24:14,641 --> 02:24:18,990
team leads together, check
out our leadership and
management consulting company.

2428
02:24:19,780 --> 02:24:22,440
It's called echelon front me, Leif, Babin,

2429
02:24:23,070 --> 02:24:24,840
JP to know Dave Burke.

2430
02:24:25,710 --> 02:24:29,520
You can email info@echelonfront.com
finally, the muster,

2431
02:24:29,521 --> 02:24:33,420
September 14th and 15th I'm pretty sure
it's sold out by the time this podcast

2432
02:24:33,421 --> 02:24:37,680
comes out. We've been able to squeeze a
couple more people in at each of these.

2433
02:24:37,681 --> 02:24:40,050
Even when we were sold out, we got
in like four, four more people,

2434
02:24:40,051 --> 02:24:44,850
three more people, seven more people
check. It might be completely sold out,

2435
02:24:44,851 --> 02:24:48,840
but extreme ownership.com
and it if you want to.

2436
02:24:48,841 --> 02:24:53,841
We're going to pretty soon get
the dates for 2018 musters going,

2437
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:59,000
so started looking into that and get
registered as early as you can and until

2438
02:25:01,531 --> 02:25:02,364
the muster.

2439
02:25:02,880 --> 02:25:07,880
If you happen to want to keep
cruising with us kind of hard.

2440
02:25:08,380 --> 02:25:12,150
Uh,
we are on the Inter webs on Twitter,

2441
02:25:13,880 --> 02:25:17,510
on Instagram and a fee sheep or Aha.

2442
02:25:18,200 --> 02:25:22,640
Echo is at echocharles and IMF,
Jocko Willink.

2443
02:25:22,670 --> 02:25:27,670
And finally to the
military members out there

2444
02:25:29,830 --> 02:25:34,830
sitting on some forgotten barricade
holding the line to protect us.

2445
02:25:37,630 --> 02:25:42,630
Thank you to the vets that stood
on the wall and did their time.

2446
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:46,433
Thank you

2447
02:25:47,970 --> 02:25:52,620
to the police, law
enforcement, firefighters,

2448
02:25:52,770 --> 02:25:55,260
EMT,
other first responders.

2449
02:25:55,320 --> 02:25:59,190
Thank you for what you
do day in and day out

2450
02:26:01,830 --> 02:26:03,570
and to the rest of you

2451
02:26:05,710 --> 02:26:10,710
with goals and dreams and aspiration.

2452
02:26:12,790 --> 02:26:14,110
Make sure you remember

2453
02:26:16,760 --> 02:26:20,210
that's seconds turned into minutes,

2454
02:26:20,210 --> 02:26:24,800
minutes turned into days
and days turn into years.

2455
02:26:27,810 --> 02:26:32,450
So make those seconds count
all of them.

2456
02:26:36,950 --> 02:26:41,880
They end up til next time.
This is echo and Jocko

2457
02:26:43,940 --> 02:26:44,230
out.
