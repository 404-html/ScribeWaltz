1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,460
I'm often given tasks on the fly,

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:07,230
whereas many of my tasks are given as
a result of meetings these days and

3
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:12,210
increasing number are coming from emails
or my manager or client asking me to do

4
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:16,560
something. I find myself quite
disorganized when dealing with this.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,670
I'm writing things down when I'm told,
but it's all over the place.

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,010
Postits notebook, phone, et cetera.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,100
I don't have a solid method of
keeping track of these things.

8
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:29,880
I'm guessing that a possible solution
is to write all these things down in the

9
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:33,810
same place, but I've also tried that
and didn't really make a difference.

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,680
I'd appreciate any input or advice
you have on how to record and track

11
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:40,560
objectives in a functional,
in a reliable manner.

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,540
As I'm subjected to a lot of
information each day, week, month,

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,520
I'm definitely overloaded to remember
it myself. Discipline equals freedom,

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,490
so yeah, a few things.
First, first of all,

15
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:58,491
definitely write the things down in one
place and it sounds like since you're

16
00:00:58,531 --> 00:01:01,830
moving all the time or you're going
to meetings carry just a nice little

17
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:06,030
notebook with you and write the
things down as you get Tash to them.

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,030
Then on top of that you have to
have a master list of some kind,

19
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,390
either paper or digital.

20
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:17,391
I'm going to probably recommend digital
to track things overall in a prioritized

21
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:20,880
method, so if you get tasked something
in a meeting and your little notebook,

22
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:24,960
you come back, you put it in the
right place in the master task list

23
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,630
and then

24
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,240
like twice a day to consolidate the
information that's in the little notebook

25
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:39,801
you have into the big master list and
then before you go to bed at night you

26
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,130
organize those things by
priority on the master list.

27
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:47,070
You put the most important thing at
the top and that's what you're going to

28
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:48,360
attack the next day.

29
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,410
That's part one on how you
get these things organized.

30
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:56,700
Now the part two is you got to schedule
this stuff and actually I always say

31
00:01:56,701 --> 00:02:00,300
this, when people have trouble with
tasks, put them on the calendar.

32
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,000
You don't actually Jamie does that for me.

33
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,690
When Jamie's got something for me to do,
she just doesn't email me and say, hey,

34
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:09,870
you need to do this. She puts it on the
calendar so I look at my calendar, boom,

35
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:12,990
there it is. I got to go do
this. Whatever this task is done.

36
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,040
So put these things on your calendar and
that includes scheduling time on your

37
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:24,831
calendar so that you can have time to
consolidate your list and do a review of

38
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:25,704
your lists.

39
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,830
You know whether that takes that probably
take 15 minutes to do and I guess

40
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:35,130
there's a bunch of apps you can
use and I'm sure people will make

41
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:35,701
recommendations,

42
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:40,140
but there's a ton of to do list
apps including there's one,

43
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,300
there's native ones on
all the different phones,

44
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,240
so you could look at that as
a possible of voice recorder.

45
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,470
You can either use the voice recorder
app you have or you can carry around a

46
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:50,730
little mini voice recorder.

47
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,320
Then you can just take notes with that
and then you consolidate those notes from

48
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:56,154
your,

49
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,350
from Your Voice Recorder into
your master task list every day,

50
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:02,760
and then you just got to
prioritize and execute

51
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,320
to pretty straight forward.
