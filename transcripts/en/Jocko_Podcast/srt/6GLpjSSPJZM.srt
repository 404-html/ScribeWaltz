1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,200
Two of my bosses have told me,
I don't like Jocko.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,290
Interesting,
interesting concept.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,370
Without giving any value, valid
reasons. Their ego is in the way.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,150
How do I flank them to
help them see the path?

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,320
My belief is that they're
afraid of the truth and they,

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,710
they're afraid of the truth
they see in extreme ownership.

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,630
Okay. So, uh, yeah, I mean,

8
00:00:26,631 --> 00:00:30,740
clearly ego could be a problem here
as a leader who wants to constantly be

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,620
compared to some other leader.
Right.

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,520
Do you know if you were teaching a Jujitsu
class, it's like, well, the way that,

11
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,400
the way that Dean teaches this, you know,
that that would make you mad afterwards.

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,920
I didn't even think so. That could be
part of the problem. Oh, that's dead.

13
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,700
That's definitely, that's way up
there on the list of possible things.

14
00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:48,140
Could be the military flavor,
right?

15
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:51,830
Some people don't like the military
flavor thing, so that's, that's okay.

16
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,300
It's,
it's

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,410
can turn some people off. They don't
want to hear about it. That's fine. Uh,

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,750
the reality is here's the,

19
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,960
but here's the reality of the situation.
Okay.

20
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,460
What is there to not like about
the things that I talk about.

21
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,810
Right? So let's say, you know what,
I don't like people taking ownership.

22
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:18,670
I want everyone to make
excuses and playing each
other, right. It doesn't even,

23
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,940
it doesn't even make sense,
you know, instead of,

24
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,280
I don't want to hear
about this cover move,

25
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:26,370
I want everyone to ignore each other
and get worried about themselves. Right.

26
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:30,120
Like that, that makes no
sense whatsoever. You know,

27
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:32,580
if a key keeping things simple,
I don't want it, hey look,

28
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:35,160
I don't want to keep things simple.
I want everything to be so complicated,

29
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,700
but no one knows what's going on. Right?
Like these things that they make, no,

30
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,290
there's no human being.

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,420
No one in a leadership position that
would want everyone or that would,

32
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,040
that would go against what
these simple principles. So.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,480
Huh?
Do

34
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,470
you fix it then? What's the
problem? Uh, one, here's a couple,

35
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,310
and actually this was a Twitter thing and
a bunch of people gave great responses

36
00:02:01,311 --> 00:02:05,480
on Twitter after I kind of
highlighted it. Uh, one,

37
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,850
one of them and my, my actual responses
like, hey, just don't, you know,

38
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,720
stop using my name. You know, stop saying,

39
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,640
well chocolates it cause you can't even
imagine how annoying that most. Well,

40
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,090
Jack was June. You know, when you're in a
leadership position, you know, it's like,

41
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,800
that's going to really great on somebody
so, so, so throw that out the window.

42
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:24,350
Don't pit it as me,

43
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,580
Jocko against what your bosses
are saying. No, don't do that.

44
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,480
You've set up an adversarial relationship
with them and you've set up or an

45
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,530
adver adversary relationship with me.

46
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,440
And I've never even met these people
before. I don't even know who they are,

47
00:02:36,441 --> 00:02:37,640
even know what business they're in.

48
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,080
But what you've done by constantly harping
on it is you've pissed them off and

49
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:44,720
now they're saying, dude, quit
talking about Jocko. We don't care.

50
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,540
Because also the way that he's just,

51
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:51,620
the way he's being offensive
in approaching these
things means that he has a

52
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:53,240
little more listening and growing to do.

53
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,410
Because if you really want to
approach your boss or you know,

54
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,280
he asked about frank as possible. The
way fight someone isn't going, hey,

55
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:03,640
the way jock was says you should
do this. Like no, that's not good.

56
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,520
So let the principals work and another,
another person pointed out, you know,

57
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,800
um, hey, don't, hey,

58
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:15,340
stop trying to impose your things on them.

59
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,540
Like take extreme ownership. How's that
sound? You step up and start leading.

60
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,300
You do your thing, you
perform well. Quit talking.

61
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:25,570
Quit trying to force these things down
people's throats and give them space.

62
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:30,570
Give them room and then they'll
recognize that you're doing a good job.

63
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,800
If you label it with something
that you know they don't like,

64
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:37,900
well then they're going not going
to like it. No matter what you do,

65
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,650
no matter what you do,
that's going to be problematic.

66
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,720
Don't bludgeon them with with, well, you
know I've, this is blah, blah, blah. No,

67
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:50,950
don't do that.
Take let but your ego in check.

68
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:53,440
How's that sound for your
ego in check a little bit.

69
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,370
Make the ideas that you're
talking about their ideas.

70
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,670
Get them to talk about
ownership, you know, get them.

71
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,550
Maybe they call it something else
other than extreme ownership.

72
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,320
Maybe they call it, you know,
a personal accountability.
Okay, awesome. That's great.

73
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:10,810
Yeah, I really liked that. I really
like what you've come up with, boss.

74
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:11,410
I'm in with.

75
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:15,550
Oh well now they're in the game and they
don't realize that you're talking about

76
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:18,880
the same thing. That's fine. Don't
they? Don't ever have to realize that.

77
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,300
They don't ever have to realize that.
So I mean,

78
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:25,330
there's some people are some people
that don't like it. Even in the teams,

79
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:28,480
there's people that like, they
didn't like me, didn't matter.

80
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:33,160
It didn't matter where, what the principal
was, didn't make dog. That's the dog.

81
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,990
It's like, no, like, hey,
just, just, just don't,

82
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,610
don't attach my name to it and go and
do to be a good leader. How's that?

83
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,980
So those are some things I think
if you live, live, the principles,

84
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,570
act on the principles.

85
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,230
No one's going to be mad at you for taking
ownership and responsibility of what

86
00:04:53,231 --> 00:04:56,440
you're doing unless you say, Ooh, you
look how I took ownership of that.

87
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,070
Well then you might paint yourself
into a corner where they ain't stupid.
