00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,390
This is Jocko podcast number
35 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,890
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,740
Weeper was ahead when he and born reached
the gap in the wire star shale after

4
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:25,330
star shell was going up now and
the whole line did woken up.

5
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:30,220
Machine guns were talking,
but there was one that would not talk.

6
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,950
The rattle of musketry continued,

7
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,570
but the mist was kindly to them.
It had thickened again

8
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,080
as they got beyond the trampling
clutching wire born saw weeper a couple of

9
00:00:44,081 --> 00:00:48,970
paces ahead of him and what he thought
was the last of their party disappearing

10
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:51,220
into the missed about 20 yards away.

11
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,190
He was glad to be clear of the wire.

12
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,200
Another star's Gel went up and they
both froze stillness under it's glare.

13
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:04,360
Then they moved again.
Hurrying for all they were worth born.

14
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:09,340
Felt a sense of triumph and
escape thrill in him. Anyway,

15
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,080
the Hun couldn't see him.
Now

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,140
something kicked him in the
upper part of the chest.

17
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,620
Rending its way through him and his
agonized cry was scarcely on a bull in the

18
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:26,310
rush of blood from his mouth
as he collapsed and fell.

19
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,500
We per turned his head over his shoulder,
listened, stopped and went back.

20
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:37,170
He found born trying to lift
himself and born spoke, gasping,

21
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,440
suffocating. Go on. I'm scuppered,

22
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,460
I'll not leave the said Wipper said
weeper he stood and lifted the other in is

23
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,040
huge on Ganglia arms.

24
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,960
Carrying him as tenderly as
though we were a child born.

25
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:57,960
Struggled weirdly to speak in the blood,

26
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,810
feeling his mouth prevented him.

27
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:07,010
Sometimes his head fell on weeper
shoulder that last barely articulate.

28
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,120
A few words came.
I'm finished.

29
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,480
Leamy and peace for God's sake.
You can't,

30
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:21,060
I'll not leave the said
weeper in infuriate rage,

31
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,560
he felt born stretch himself in
a convulsive shutter and relax,

32
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,470
becoming suddenly heavier in his arms.

33
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,880
He struggled on stumbling over the shell
plowed ground through that fantastic

34
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:42,540
mist, which moved like an army of
wraiths hurrying away from him.

35
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,310
Then he stopped and taking the body
by the waist with his left arm,

36
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,490
flung it over his shoulder,
steadying it with his right.

37
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,760
He could see their wire now and
presently he was challenged and replied.

38
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,380
He found the way through the wire

39
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,580
and staggered into the
trench with his burden.

40
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,570
And he turned down the short stretch.

41
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,320
Yeah,

42
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,320
to monk trench trench and came
on the rest of the party outside.

43
00:03:15,051 --> 00:03:19,550
A company's dug out.
I brought him back.

44
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:24,730
He cried desperately and collapsed
with the body on the duck boards

45
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,230
in that is from a book called
the middle parts of fortune,

46
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,700
which is written by a gay
guy named Frederick Manning
who served with the Kings

47
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,540
Shropshire light infantry
in world war one.

48
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:55,860
He served with the seventh battalion at
the battle of the Somme and after the

49
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:59,490
war he became a writer in the book,

50
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,080
which is actually a novel,

51
00:04:01,081 --> 00:04:06,081
but based on his experiences was published
as being written by private one nine

52
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:13,311
zero two two total got
originally published and then
after his death he finally

53
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:19,910
received credit for writing it
and it's a,

54
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,770
it's a very powerful book and I wanted
to start with that excerpt from World War

55
00:04:25,771 --> 00:04:30,771
One because it is the most shining in
my mind in most horrific example of

56
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:34,140
attrition warfare,

57
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:39,590
almost 20 million killed usually over a
few hundred yards of trench and I can't,

58
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,820
I can't stand that.

59
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,990
Attrition warfare is a strategy in which
one side tries to grind down and wear

60
00:04:52,261 --> 00:04:53,190
down the other side

61
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,890
and they break when they
no longer have the men,

62
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,410
the soldiers,
the people,

63
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,860
the humans or the
supplies to keep it going

64
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:14,590
and it's brutal and it also gives no real
advantage to intellect thought and to

65
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:23,490
tactical prowess on the battlefield

66
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,340
and I don't like it.

67
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,550
Now the opposite of attrition
warfare is maneuver warfare.

68
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,820
And that's what we're
going to dive into tonight.

69
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,870
The book is the Maneuver Warfare Handbook,

70
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,310
but as we talk about it,

71
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,740
think about it not just being
about war and about combat,

72
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,230
but about how attrition,

73
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:58,231
warfare and maneuver warfare can be
easily seen in the way that we lead in.

74
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,400
No, and also in the way we interact
with other people with other humans,

75
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:05,540
which is what leading is.

76
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,873
Hmm.

77
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,380
And so here we go into
this book right here,

78
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,300
maneuver warfare handbook.

79
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,610
It's written by William s Linde
and we'll get into him in a minute.

80
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,210
Here we go.
With the book.

81
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,780
I served over 31 years active
duty with the marine corps,

82
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,640
saw combat in both Korea and Vietnam and
attended service schools from the basic

83
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,710
school to the National War College.

84
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,690
Yet only toward the end of my military
career did I realize how little I really

85
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:40,280
understood the art of war.

86
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,180
Even as a PFC in Korea after
being medivaced along with
most of my platoon after

87
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:50,150
a fruitless frontal assault against
superior North Korean forces,

88
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,080
it seemed to me there had to
be a better way to wage war.

89
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,180
17 years later commanding a bat,
a battalion at k song,

90
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:04,690
I was resolved that none of my re marines
would die for lack of superior combat

91
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:05,564
power,

92
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,320
but we were still relying
on the concentration of
superior fire power to win,

93
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,390
essentially still practicing grants,

94
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:19,280
attrition warfare and we were
still doing frontal assaults.

95
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:25,310
That opening right there
is a colonel John c stuck,

96
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,530
uh, Marine Corps obviously, and
he just kinda explained his, his,

97
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,490
his career path serving in both Korea
and Vietnam and he goes on the author of

98
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:40,280
this book, so he's doing the foreword
to this book, Maneuver Warfare.

99
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:45,340
The author of this book has never served
a day of active military duty and he

100
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:47,150
has never been shot at,

101
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,850
although there are no doubt some senior
officers would like to remedy that later

102
00:07:52,851 --> 00:07:56,090
ladder deficiency.
So he's a little bit unpopular.

103
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:59,120
The guy that wrote this book
with some with some people,

104
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:04,420
yet he demonstrates an
amazing understanding of the
art of war as have only a

105
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:09,260
small handful of military thinkers
I have come across in my career.

106
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:14,570
So he's talking about this
Guy William William s Lind.

107
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:17,460
Okay.

108
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,830
And here he goes into some details
on William s Lind and how he,

109
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:24,190
how he came into contact with them.
Back to the book.

110
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,720
When I first heard bill Lind speak,
I must confess,

111
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:33,580
I resented a mirror civilian expressing
criticism of the way our beloved core

112
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:37,480
did things. After all,
he was not one of us.

113
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,030
He had not shed blood with us in battle.

114
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:45,060
He was not a brother and I had strong
suspicions that he would have difficulty

115
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:50,240
passing the Pft, meaning the
physical test of physical this.

116
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,140
So this guy with a Linde,
not,

117
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:56,010
not exactly a high level athlete,

118
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:02,330
but what he said made sense for the first
time I was personally hearing someone

119
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:04,250
advocate a new unapproached,

120
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:08,310
a war that was based on intellectual
innovation rather than sheer material

121
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:12,450
superiority, mission type
orders, surfaces and gaps.

122
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:17,190
She feared punked instead of the rigid
formulas and checklists that we normally

123
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:19,260
associate with our training and doctrine.

124
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:23,670
It was a stimulating experience
through Lynn's articulation.

125
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,710
Years of my own reading of military
history began to make a lot more sense.

126
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,260
Okay,

127
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:34,580
but why all this from a civilian instead
of a professional soldier? In fact,

128
00:09:34,581 --> 00:09:35,880
the entire movement for,

129
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,980
for military reform is driven
largely by civilian intellectuals,

130
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:44,000
not military officers. One notable
exception being retired air force,

131
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:47,750
Colonel John Boyd.
When you think about it,

132
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,100
this is not surprising.

133
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,630
We have never institutionalized a system
that encourages innovative ideas or

134
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,740
curry or criticism from subordinates.
So there you go.

135
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,380
It's the military w
what do you say to your,

136
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,560
what do you say to your superior officer?
I don't think that's a good plan. No.

137
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,690
What they're told to
do is support the plant

138
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,240
proposing significant change.
His view,

139
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,760
frequently viewed as
criticism of superiors.

140
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,440
Since they are responsible for the way
things are and borders on disloyalty,

141
00:10:17,441 --> 00:10:19,030
if not insubordination.

142
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,890
So it is not surprising that the Movement
for reform comes from outside the

143
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:25,060
military establishment.

144
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,510
And he goes on to say Bh Lid,
that Ladelle heart,

145
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,520
which Bh Liddell Hart was a guy
that fought in world war one,

146
00:10:36,521 --> 00:10:40,420
a Brit that fought in world
war one battle the psalm,

147
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,290
he got hit three times,
uh,

148
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:49,291
eventually was gassed set out on the
line and almost his entire battalion was

149
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,124
wiped out.

150
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,660
And this guy eventually
wrote a book called strategy,

151
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,640
an indirect approach.
And an interesting,

152
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:02,980
I pulled up one quote from him,
um,

153
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:08,020
often the longest way around
is the shortest way there.

154
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,470
This is the indirect approach.
So anyways,

155
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:16,260
back to the book here on what
Bh Ladelle heart said bl, uh,

156
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:20,260
heart once remark that the only thing
harder than getting a new idea into the

157
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:25,261
military mind is to get an old one out
in 1925 when he was expounding such

158
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:30,730
hysterical theories as
the indirect approach,

159
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:35,830
the American General Service Schools
Review of current military literature

160
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,980
dismissed one of Lidl hearts major works
as negative value to the instructors at

161
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:43,660
these schools.

162
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,460
I expect Marine Corps schools to
receive this publication with similar

163
00:11:48,461 --> 00:11:49,330
enthusiasm,

164
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,620
but I cannot believe a professional
military officer would not benefit reading

165
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:54,454
it.

166
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,753
Okay,

167
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,590
so that's if you took to,

168
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,080
to catch the setup of this
book. He's saying, look,

169
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:05,870
this is different than what we've been
taught. This is the different in in,

170
00:12:05,871 --> 00:12:08,210
by the way, this, this book, I'm
checking the dates right now.

171
00:12:08,211 --> 00:12:13,211
This came out in 1985 so there has been
progress in this direction since then.

172
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,970
But at the time that this came out,
it was just,

173
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:23,020
it was viewed as almost
insubordination to think this way.

174
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,360
So let's jump into it right here

175
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:37,050
with the theory of maneuver warfare.

176
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:41,880
So now we're getting to Linde himself.
Writing maneuver warfare is not new.

177
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,510
It probably dates from the
first time a caveman surprise,

178
00:12:45,511 --> 00:12:48,660
an enemy from behind instead
of meeting him club to club.

179
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,330
Sometimes the word maneuver is
used as a synonym for movement.

180
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,720
Such such as in references to fire
and maneuver in small unit tactics.

181
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:05,610
So that's, you know, we have in the
book extreme ownership cover move and,

182
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,660
and that's what we're talking about.
We're talking about move,

183
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,470
he's saying fire maneuver is the same
use of the word maneuver to mean move.

184
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,953
Yeah.

185
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,850
Maneuver is organized movement of
troops during combat operations to a new

186
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:23,851
access and region for
the purpose of taking an
advantageous position relative to

187
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:28,921
the enemy in order to deliver a decisive
strike so that that's sort of the

188
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:30,940
classical definition,

189
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,790
but when used in the phrase maneuver
warfare maneuver means much more.

190
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,960
Only recently has someone suggested a
convincing answer of of what maneuver

191
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:44,464
means.

192
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:48,910
That man is a retired air force colonel
and fighter pilot named John Boyd.

193
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,530
Colonel Boyd's development of the theory
of maneuver warfare began not with

194
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:54,550
ground battles,

195
00:13:55,090 --> 00:14:00,090
but with a study of some mock air to
air combat exercises conducted at Nellis

196
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,780
Air Force Base in 1974 that led him
back to the study of air to air combat.

197
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:06,100
During the Korean War.

198
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,270
American aviators were very
successful in that conflict.

199
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,690
They achieved a 10 to one
kill ratio over there.

200
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:15,640
North Korean and Chinese opponents.

201
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,910
Colonel Boyd began his
study with a question,

202
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,610
how and why did we do so well?

203
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,510
He noted in several tradition,

204
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,680
he noted that in several traditional
measures of aircraft performance,

205
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,540
the principal communist fighter,

206
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:36,541
the make 15 was superior to the
American f 86 so you might think,

207
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:40,720
oh, Americans always have the
best technology, not true. So and,

208
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,580
and Boyd will end up doing void.

209
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,080
We're going to hear quite
a bit about them right now,

210
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,910
but this guy was sort of a strategic
genius in the air force and a bunch of

211
00:14:48,911 --> 00:14:51,890
people on Twitter hit me and social media.
I've always been saying,

212
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,350
you gotta do Boyd,
got to do Boyd and I,

213
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,010
and I know I've got to
do Boyd at some point.

214
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,390
And this is sort of a good
introduction to Boyd. So here's the,

215
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:04,391
here's the difference between the make
15 and the American f 86 the mic 15 it

216
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:10,220
could climb and accelerate faster and
it had better sustained turn rate.

217
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,060
But in two less obvious measures
of aircraft performance,

218
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:18,110
the [inaudible] 86 was much
superior to the mic. First.

219
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,780
The pilot could see out much bet better.

220
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,960
The fat six bubble canopy gave its
pilot very good outward vision.

221
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:30,620
While the Migs faired fared,
canopy made it difficult to see out.

222
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,060
Second,

223
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:37,060
the SF 86 had a high powered and highly
effective hydraulic controls and the meg

224
00:15:37,951 --> 00:15:38,784
did not.

225
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:44,140
This meant that while the Mig could do
many individual actions including turn,

226
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,290
climb and accelerate
better than the fat six,

227
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,560
the fat six could transition from one
action to another much more quickly than

228
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:57,410
the Mig.
It was better in the transition,

229
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,860
so for all you Jujitsu players
and you start that scramble,

230
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,490
you start that scrambled,
the the f 86 is a better scrambler.

231
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,450
Using these two superiorities,

232
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:12,350
the American pilots developed a tactical
approach that forced the Mig into a

233
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:16,820
series of actions each.
Each time the action changed.

234
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:21,940
The fad six gained a time advantage
because the f 86 pilot could see more

235
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:27,641
quickly how the situation had changed
and he could also make his aircraft shift

236
00:16:27,771 --> 00:16:31,400
more quickly to a new action so he
can see what's happening faster.

237
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,230
Then once he sees it, which he saw faster,
now he can make his adjustment faster.

238
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,510
With each change,

239
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:43,540
the migs actions became more inappropriate
until they were so inappropriate that

240
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:47,510
the Mig gave the fat six
a good firing opportunity.

241
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,890
Often it appeared the Mig pilot realized
what was happening to him and panicked

242
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,950
which made the American
pilot's job all the easier.

243
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:56,943
Okay.

244
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,710
Later,

245
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:01,480
Colonel Boyd began studying ground combat
to see if there were any situations

246
00:17:01,481 --> 00:17:04,910
similar to that he had found
in the air war over Korea.

247
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:10,450
He found that in battles campaigns
in wars like Vicksburg and France,

248
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:15,680
a similar things seem to have happened
one side at presented the other with a

249
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:20,450
sudden unexpected change or a series
of such changes to which it could not

250
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:23,390
adjust in a timely manner.
As a result,

251
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:28,160
it was defeated and it was generally
defeated at small costs as the victor.

252
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,960
Often the losing side had been
physically stronger than the winner,

253
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,020
just like the Mig 15 was,
was physically faster, it,

254
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,930
it didn't matter

255
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:46,870
and often the same sort of panic and
paralysis the North Korean and Chinese

256
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:51,270
pilots had shown seem to occur.
Colonel Boyd asked himself,

257
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,700
what did all these cases have in common?

258
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,170
His answer was what is now
called the Boyd theory,

259
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,170
which is the theory of maneuver warfare.

260
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:07,110
The briefing Colonel Boyd gives to explain
his theory patterns of conflict takes

261
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:09,540
over five hours. So he, so the,

262
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:13,860
so Colonel Boyd does give this brief and
it takes over five hours or he did when

263
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:14,910
he was,
when he was alive,

264
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,020
but at the cost of missing some of the
subtleties and supporting historical

265
00:18:19,021 --> 00:18:21,210
evidence in the briefing,
it can be summarized as follows.

266
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:25,740
So here's a kind of a synopsis
of the Boyd Theory that, uh,

267
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,930
Lind is going to put
together for us right now.

268
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,390
Okay.

269
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,350
Back to the book.

270
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,810
Conflict can be seen as time
competitive observation,

271
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:39,200
orientation,
decision action cycles.

272
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:44,480
Each party to a conflict begins
by observing. He observes himself,

273
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:48,680
has physical surroundings and his
enemy on the basis of his opposite

274
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,540
observation,
he orients.

275
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:55,810
That is to say he makes a mental image
or snapshot of his situation on the basis

276
00:18:56,001 --> 00:19:00,680
of this orientation. He makes a decision,
he puts the decision into effect.

277
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:01,610
I,
he,

278
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:06,610
he acts then because he assumes his
action has changed the situation.

279
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,920
He observes again and
starts the process of new.

280
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,080
His actions follow a cycle,

281
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:17,470
sometimes called the Boyd cycle or
Ooda loop and Buddhas o d a and that's

282
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:20,810
observe, Orient, decide and act.

283
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,560
If one side in a conflict can consistently
go through the Boyd cycle faster than

284
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:30,750
the other, it gains a
tremendous advantage, advantage.

285
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,450
By the time the slower side acts,

286
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:38,220
the faster side is doing something
different from what he observed and his

287
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:41,040
action is inappropriate.
With each cycle.

288
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,770
The slower parties action
is inappropriately,

289
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,800
is inappropriate by a larger time margin,

290
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,370
even though he desperately strives
to do something that will work,

291
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,130
each action is less useful
than its predecessor.

292
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,640
He falls further and further behind.
Ultimately,

293
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,990
he ceases to be effective
and neat. We clearly, I mean,

294
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,370
this is obvious and combat is also obvious
and in Jiu Jitsu, I mean very clear.

295
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,230
When you're training,
when you're rolling with somebody,

296
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:12,060
if they're not making adjustments
fast enough, you just,

297
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,850
it's two or three,
two or three transitions and you got them,

298
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,920
you're on their back.
You,

299
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,040
yeah.

300
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,030
The Boyd theory defines what
is meant by the word maneuver.

301
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,810
In the term maneuver warfare
maneuver means Boyd cycling,

302
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,460
Boyd cycling the enemy being consistently
faster through however many Ooda loops

303
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:33,650
it takes until the enemy
loses his cohesion,

304
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,490
until he can no longer fight and
as an effective organized force,

305
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,690
sometimes a Boyd cycled enemy
panics or becomes passive.

306
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,460
This is an ideal outcome for the victor
because a panicked passive enemy can be

307
00:20:46,461 --> 00:20:51,130
annihilated, captured at the
lowest cost in friendly casualties.

308
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,571
At other times,

309
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:57,160
the outmaneuvered enemy may continue
to fight as individuals or small units,

310
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,700
but because he can no longer
act effectively as a force,

311
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,430
he is comparatively easy to destroy.

312
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,083
Okay,

313
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,630
so continuing on,

314
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:13,130
if the object in maneuver warfare is to
move through the Ooda loops faster than

315
00:21:13,131 --> 00:21:17,960
the enemy, what do you need to do?
How can you be consistently faster?

316
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:23,090
Much of the much of the rest of this book
is an effort to address that question,

317
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:28,190
but in terms of general theory, the
following points are worth thinking about.

318
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:33,670
One only a decentralized military
can have a faster Ooda loop.

319
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:40,280
If the observations must be passed up, the
chain of command, the orientation made,

320
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:43,580
and the decision taken at a high
level and the command for action then

321
00:21:43,581 --> 00:21:48,050
transmitted back down the chain,
the Ooda loop is going to be slow.

322
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:55,590
As the Israeli military historian Martin
Van Creveld has observed from Plato to

323
00:21:57,131 --> 00:21:57,964
NATO,

324
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:03,160
the history of command in war consists
of an endless quest for certainty.

325
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:04,860
Yeah.

326
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,430
Certainty concerning the state and
intention of the enemy's forces.

327
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:12,720
Certainty concerning the manifold
factors which together constitute the

328
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:17,010
environment from the weather and the
terrain to the radioactivity and presence

329
00:22:17,011 --> 00:22:18,540
of chemical warfare agents.

330
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,750
And last but definitely not
least certainty concerning
the state and activities

331
00:22:23,881 --> 00:22:25,440
of one's own forces.

332
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:30,750
Historical commanders have always faced
with a choice between two basic ways of

333
00:22:30,751 --> 00:22:32,490
coping with uncertainty.

334
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,240
One was to construct an army of automatons
following the orders of a single man

335
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,180
allowed to do only that
which could be controlled.

336
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,390
That's centralized command.

337
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:50,630
The other two design organizations and
operations in such a way as to enable the

338
00:22:51,691 --> 00:22:56,691
former to carry out the latter without
the need for continuous control this

339
00:22:57,271 --> 00:23:01,110
second, the second of these methods
has that's decentralized command.

340
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:06,300
The second of these methods has by and
large proved more successful than the

341
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:11,160
first and the ongoing revolution
in the technology of command,

342
00:23:11,161 --> 00:23:11,994
not withstanding,

343
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:17,120
this is likely to remain so in the
future and indeed so long as war itself

344
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,240
exists.

345
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,390
Very obvious stuff in and again,
you know in in,

346
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:27,600
in our book extreme ownership.
That's one of the principles of,

347
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,550
of combat decentralized
command and this is what it is.

348
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,880
If you don't have decentralized command
that you have to report up the chain of

349
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:41,120
command, that takes time. By the time
it gets back down what the decision,

350
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,450
the decision gets made at the higher
level, then they pass it back down to you.

351
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,380
By the time it gets to you,
it's already changed.

352
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:53,240
And that's in a Jujitsu
and Jujitsu comparison,

353
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:58,010
if you will, if you have to think about
your moves so you have instinct moves,

354
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:02,600
muscle memory. When somebody starts to
pass your guard, you get the under rock.

355
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,900
If you have to think about getting the
underhook and you have to command your

356
00:24:05,901 --> 00:24:08,680
body to get the underwear because they
already got the under hook on you. Yeah,

357
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,570
so it's the same thing here.
This is that's decentralized command.

358
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,020
Back to the book number two,

359
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:20,050
maneuver warfare means you will not
only except confusion and disorder and

360
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,260
operate successfully within
it through decentralization,

361
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:29,060
you will also generate confusion
and disorder. I love that.

362
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,610
That's just awesome, right?
It's not just saying, hey, look,

363
00:24:31,611 --> 00:24:34,910
things are getting confusing, but I'm
actually gonna create the confusion.

364
00:24:34,911 --> 00:24:35,930
I'm going to make it happen.

365
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:39,080
That's something any when you see the
really good you did, you guys have been,

366
00:24:39,081 --> 00:24:41,960
Glover does that. Glover creates
confusion. He creates ma'am,

367
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:45,710
he creates chaos in the gay, in the, in
the match. He wants to scramble to happen.

368
00:24:45,711 --> 00:24:47,120
He wants to go as long as possible.

369
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,040
Okay.

370
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:54,000
The reconnaissance pole tactics
of the German blitzkrieg,

371
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,860
we're inherently disorderly.
Now,

372
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:58,290
is this something that's very
contrary to what people think of,

373
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,780
of the German military and
even the German culture?

374
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:05,090
German culture is very
orderly and here we say they,

375
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,260
the blitzkrieg was inherently disorderly.

376
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:12,450
Back to book higher headquarters could
neither direct nor predict the exact path

377
00:25:12,451 --> 00:25:13,290
of the advance,

378
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:18,480
but the multitude of German reconnaissance
thrust generated massive confusion

379
00:25:18,481 --> 00:25:22,680
among the French in 1940 each
was reported as a new attack.

380
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,900
The Germans seem to be everywhere and
the French who system demanded certainty

381
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:31,080
before making any decisions,
we're paralyzed.

382
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:32,890
Okay?

383
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:33,450
It's,

384
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:38,450
it's very interesting to think about that
idea of we all want to have certainty

385
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:44,020
in what's going to happen and
how in in battle and in life,

386
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,680
if you wait until you're 100% certain,
you're probably going to be too late.

387
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,380
Mm hmm.

388
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,420
Speaking of certainty,
three all patterns,

389
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,810
recipes and formulas are to be avoided.

390
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,320
The enemy must not be able
to predict your actions.

391
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,350
If you're tactics follow
predictable patterns,

392
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:07,320
the enemy can easily cut
inside your Ooda loop.

393
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:11,250
If he can predict what you will do,
he will be waiting for you.

394
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,980
This is why it's so hard to tell
someone how to do maneuver warfare.

395
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,510
There is no formula you can learn.
When someone says,

396
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,520
cut all the bull about theory,
just tell me what to do. You can't.

397
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:31,530
You can talk about how to think
and about some useful techniques,

398
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:36,650
but you can't give new formulas to replace
the ones currently taught instead of

399
00:26:37,861 --> 00:26:39,660
a checklist or a cookbook.

400
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:44,490
Maneuver warfare requires commanders
who can sense more than they can see,

401
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,020
who understand the opponent's strengths
and weaknesses and their own and who can

402
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:52,530
find the enemy's critical
weaknesses in a specific situation.

403
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,050
They must be able to create multiple
threats and keep the enemy uncertain as to

404
00:26:58,051 --> 00:26:58,980
which one is real.

405
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:04,680
They must be able to see their options
in the situation before them constantly

406
00:27:04,801 --> 00:27:09,801
create new options and shift rapidly
among options as the situation develops.

407
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,560
General Herman Bulk,

408
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,670
one of the most successful
practitioners of maneuver warfare said,

409
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:21,690
I'm against the school approach that
says in accordance with the ideas of the

410
00:27:21,691 --> 00:27:25,560
general staff in this situation,
you must do thus and such.

411
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,750
On the contrary,

412
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:33,050
you must proceed as dictated by the
personalities involved and the particulars

413
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:35,100
of the situation.

414
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,880
So he got a German successful German
general and he's actually saying you react

415
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,130
based not just on the situation of the,
of the on the ground,

416
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,310
put on the personalities involved.

417
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,800
Leadership is an art,
my friend.

418
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:01,210
Therefore one of the first principles
has to be there can be no fixed schemes.

419
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,360
Every scheme,
every pattern is wrong.

420
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,390
No two situations are identical.

421
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:12,470
That is why the study of military
history can be extremely dangerous.

422
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:18,320
Another principle that follows from is
from this is never do the same thing

423
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,810
twice.
Even if something works well for you,

424
00:28:20,811 --> 00:28:23,450
once by the second time the
enemy will have adapted.

425
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,670
So you have to think of something new.

426
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,390
No one thinks of becoming a great
painter simply by imitating Michelangelo.

427
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:33,973
Similarly,

428
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:38,810
you can't become a great military
leader just by imitating someone.

429
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,950
It has to come from within.
In the last analysis,

430
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,320
military command is an art.

431
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:49,670
One man can do it in most will never learn

432
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:58,080
little bit of maneuver warfare and so,

433
00:28:58,081 --> 00:29:01,170
so at the,
the way the book is broken up,

434
00:29:01,171 --> 00:29:04,050
this book is called Maneuver
Warfare Handbook. It's,

435
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,840
it goes into a,

436
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,850
it breaks into a nother section which
we're going to get to in a minute,

437
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,650
but he kind of goes into a little bit.

438
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,840
Linde go now goes into a little bit
talking about education and training.

439
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,080
Okay.

440
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,913
Back to the book.

441
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:27,220
It is my great and this is a quote is
my great inconstant hope that the Marine

442
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:31,100
Corps will produce some
outstanding man for this country.

443
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:35,720
Such men are somewhere and they may as
well be in our classes is anywhere else.

444
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:40,670
I do not want such a person to be
hammered down by narrowness and

445
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:46,450
to have his mind cramped
by compulsory details.

446
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:51,990
It is my constant ambition to see the
marine officers filled with ambition and

447
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:58,040
initiative and originality and they can
get these attributes only by liberal

448
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,660
liberality of thought.

449
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,870
Broad thought that differs,

450
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:10,170
fought that differs from precedent
and the compulsory imprint of others.

451
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:16,960
And that is a long paragraph
that says free your mind,

452
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:22,030
free your mind. And I love pointing
us out cause this is the marine corps.

453
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,010
That's that. That quote is from the
commandant of the Marine Corps schools,

454
00:30:27,011 --> 00:30:32,011
Brigadier General JC Breckenridge
written in 1934 in 1934 he was saying,

455
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:39,460
people, Marine Corps officers
don't go by the book,

456
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:43,750
don't obey what other people said
he wants them filled with ambition.

457
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,583
That's pretty normal,

458
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:49,120
but initiative and
originality he's telling to,

459
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:53,830
in order to be a good leader,
you got to free your mind.

460
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:59,470
Now, like I said, the book makes
a transition from being the,

461
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,940
the uh,

462
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,920
from being the introduction by,

463
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,680
by William Lind about maneuver warfare.

464
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,410
And then it slides into another section,

465
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,930
which is just about as big in this.

466
00:31:13,931 --> 00:31:17,080
This part is called
fundamentals of tactics.

467
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,970
And this section is written
by Colonel Michael D. Wiley,

468
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,230
United States Marine Corps.
And he ran a course,

469
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,990
a of fundamentals of tactics course.

470
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:32,110
And this is sort of the,
this is the,

471
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:35,020
this is the notes from the course
when he would teach this course,

472
00:31:35,021 --> 00:31:37,870
the fundamentals of tactics and a
Colonel Wiley, kind of interesting.

473
00:31:37,871 --> 00:31:40,750
He went to the, went to the,
he was an enlisted marine,

474
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:45,780
then he went to the Naval Academy and
he was Jim Webb's company commander in

475
00:31:47,801 --> 00:31:49,150
Vietnam, Vietnam. And,

476
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:53,950
and Jim Webb is a fairly famous guy.

477
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:57,630
He was a navy cross winner.
He's a now a CEO.

478
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,160
He was a senator from Virginia.
Um,

479
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:04,480
he wrote a book called fields of fire.

480
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:09,580
And then there's another great
book called the Nightingale Song,

481
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,370
which is,
it follows a couple,

482
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:17,710
five or so. Yeah, I
think it's, it's a web,

483
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,573
McCain,

484
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:23,740
Oliver North Macfarlane I think.

485
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,480
And, and John Poindexter. Anyways,

486
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:30,510
very prominent graduates from the naval
academy that all kind of stood out and

487
00:32:32,531 --> 00:32:37,390
were, were connected throughout the
book. So this guy, so Jim Webb is,

488
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:40,250
this is this kind of a famous
guy and guy that wrote this was,

489
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:43,520
was Jim Webb's company
commander in Vietnam. So that's

490
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,220
kind of, it's a small world
and things tied together.

491
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,390
So now we get into these
lectures that he wrote in.

492
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:57,500
I don't mean to lecture anybody, but hey,
they're called lectures in this book.

493
00:32:57,501 --> 00:33:01,090
I would just call them free fro
information. We're going to learn from it.

494
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:05,690
The first, the first section
is called surfaces and gaps.

495
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:12,520
The concept of surfaces and gaps is
one of several concepts that bear on

496
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:13,574
tactics.

497
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:19,060
It is unimportant whether you refer to
this concept as surfaces and gaps or soft

498
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:24,140
spot tactics or simply the idea of
pitting your strength against the enemy's

499
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:24,980
weaknesses.

500
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,770
That is what is all about strength
against weakness, call it what you will.

501
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:36,340
The term surfaces and gaps is derived
from a German term flaking Lucan tactic,

502
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,670
which means simply the
tactics of surfaces and gaps,

503
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:47,150
the surfaces being the enemy's
strong points which we avoid.

504
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:50,450
The gaps being the weak points
that we want to go through.

505
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,670
Now, Ladelle heart or we
talked about already today

506
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,970
called it the expanding
torrent system tactic.

507
00:34:00,971 --> 00:34:05,971
He drew an analogy between attacking and
attacking army in a torrent of water.

508
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,040
If we watch our torrent bearing down on
each successive Bank of earth and dam

509
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:12,671
and its path,

510
00:34:12,671 --> 00:34:17,110
we see that it first beats against the
obstacle feeling and testing it on all

511
00:34:17,111 --> 00:34:19,360
points.
Eventually it fall.

512
00:34:19,361 --> 00:34:24,361
It finds a small crack through this crack
pour the first droplets of water and

513
00:34:25,901 --> 00:34:30,220
rush straight on. The pent up water on
each side is drawn towards the breach.

514
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:35,110
It's swirls through around the flanks
of the breach wearing away the earth on

515
00:34:35,111 --> 00:34:38,200
each side and so widening
the gap simultaneously.

516
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:41,260
The water behind poor street
through that breach between this,

517
00:34:41,261 --> 00:34:46,220
the side Eddie's which are wearing away
the flanks, direct lead is pass through.

518
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,480
It expands to widen once more the
on reach of the turn of the torrent.

519
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:56,890
Thus as the water pours through an
in and an ever increasing volume,

520
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:01,360
the on reach of the torrent swells to
its original proportion, leaving in turn,

521
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,280
each crumbling obstacle behind it.

522
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,023
Yeah,

523
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:09,740
long paragraph,
but that's how water gets through.

524
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:13,100
Things finds the weak point in piles on

525
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,210
the idea of putting surfaces and gaps.

526
00:35:17,211 --> 00:35:21,740
Tactics into practice was
first implemented by the
German army in World War One.

527
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:26,000
This is stuff that every everybody
should know, especially military people.

528
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,870
In 1918 as they prepared for
Luton Dorf spring offensive,

529
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,930
the German army changed
its offensive tactics.

530
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,800
The Germans had found that they were being
overpowered by the material available

531
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:39,090
to the British and the French.

532
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,170
The Americans were coming and it was clear
that Germany was going to lose if she

533
00:35:43,171 --> 00:35:47,460
did not do something differently
because they did not have the option of

534
00:35:47,461 --> 00:35:49,740
matching the allies strength and material,

535
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:53,010
the German society that they
would have to out think them.

536
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:56,880
That is they would have
to have better tactics.

537
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:01,710
Germany did not succeed in winning the
war. It was too late. By this time.

538
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,730
They were surrounded, but women
and children were starving at home.

539
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,950
It was simply too late for them to win.

540
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:12,900
Yet they made some tactical
progress there. At the last,

541
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:18,170
at last in the spring of
1918 they inflicted terrible
defeats on their enemies

542
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:22,650
to the point that the allied armies were
seriously considering the prospect of

543
00:36:22,651 --> 00:36:25,500
giving up at the tactical level.

544
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:30,150
The Germans put their strength against
weakness. They sought the gaps.

545
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:35,510
Small assault groups called sturm grouping
sought gaps in the enemy lines and

546
00:36:35,521 --> 00:36:38,400
attack through them assaulting
with light machine guns, rifles,

547
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:39,780
grenades and flame throwers.

548
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:43,080
While heavy machine guns
direct and indirect weapons,

549
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,710
including trench mortars were used
to suppress enemy's strong points,

550
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,070
but on the strategic level,

551
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:54,420
the spring of 1918 off offensive failed.
Why?

552
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:59,690
Because Luton Dorf on that level
puts strength against strength.

553
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,250
He was seek though he was seeking gaps.

554
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,730
He was seeking gaps at
the enemy's strong points.

555
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:10,500
That's a very great, great
information to have. So yeah,

556
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:14,490
the guys on the ground war attacking the
weak points, but the strategic picture,

557
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:17,100
they were still attacking a strong area,

558
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:20,280
so you might've found a little weakness
in a wall, a little weakness in the wire,

559
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:22,620
a little weakness in the trench,
but they were attacking a,

560
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,640
let's say a 20 mile trench that
was overall was a strong area,

561
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,000
whereas they should have looked for where
the flanks are a hundred miles away.

562
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:33,750
Back to the book,

563
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:38,930
the idea of putting strength
against weakness was of
course born way before 1918

564
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:44,740
Klaus fits writes about it in chapter
nine and 10 of book seven in chapter nine

565
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,640
regarding defensive positions.

566
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:51,300
He states the attack cannot
prevail against them.

567
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:56,690
It has no means at its disposal to
counteract their advantage in practice.

568
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:59,970
Not all defensive positions are like this.

569
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,510
If the attacker sees that he can
get away without assaulting them,

570
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,270
it would be stupid of
him not to attempt it.

571
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,980
There'll be stupid of him to attempt it.

572
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,630
It is a risky business to attack
an abl opponent in a good position.

573
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,640
Same thing we heard from Sun Tzu.

574
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:19,170
You don't attack heavily
defended positions.

575
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:21,663
Okay.

576
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,573
Back to the book.

577
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:27,470
Employment of this concept of surfaces
and gaps then gives us many advantages

578
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,740
over what could be called
slower moving forms of combat,

579
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:35,150
where strength is thrown against strength.
Attacking through gaps.

580
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,340
Surfaces

581
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:40,450
gives us an advantage of economy of force.
If we are pitted.

582
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:43,300
Strength against strength,
assaulting enemy's strong points.

583
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:48,100
We are consuming our manpower as well as
ammunition to supplies as we go along.

584
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,870
If we go through the gaps,
we are practicing economy of force.

585
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:55,960
We are reaching our objective
without using up our men.

586
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:59,830
We are leaving the enemy behind
because we are moving faster.

587
00:38:59,831 --> 00:39:02,350
We have the advantage
of rapid exploitation,

588
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,380
so when you tack obviously tack weaknesses
you lose less. Be Lose less men.

589
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,500
Now this is important.

590
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:16,910
The concept of surfaces and gaps demands
leadership from the front as opposed to

591
00:39:16,911 --> 00:39:18,080
leadership from the rear.

592
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,650
The commander must be where
he can make swift decisions.

593
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,410
He must be where the
situation is developing.

594
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:29,980
Obviously leadership from the front
had become a scarcity in world war one.

595
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,330
JFC follower in his book,

596
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,810
General Ship wrote in the World War.

597
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:40,160
Nothing was more dreadful to witness
that a chain of men starting with a

598
00:39:40,161 --> 00:39:44,780
battalion commander and ending with
the army commander sitting in telephone

599
00:39:44,781 --> 00:39:48,650
boxes improvised or actual talking,
talking,

600
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:52,940
talking in place of
leading, leading, leading.

601
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:58,610
The result was unresponsive
leadership and slow reactions.

602
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:02,990
We actually talked about this on the
last podcast when Leif was talking about

603
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:08,270
being in an assault force and being in
the assault train, which is 20 guys,

604
00:40:08,271 --> 00:40:12,650
15 or 20 guys and he was standing always
at the end of the train cause that's

605
00:40:12,651 --> 00:40:14,900
where he was told he
was supposed to be in.

606
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,820
He didn't know what's going on
the front so he couldn't help.

607
00:40:16,821 --> 00:40:19,330
He couldn't make any decisions.
If someone was going to,

608
00:40:19,331 --> 00:40:20,450
if he needed to make a decision,

609
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,210
well we couldn't even make a decision
because you know what's going on up there.

610
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,370
But if someone said, hey, we
need a decision from the boss,

611
00:40:25,371 --> 00:40:27,200
they had to pass that
word all the way back,

612
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,733
not good,

613
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:37,170
so you got to lead from the front with
decentralized command and be far enough

614
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:39,610
the phone. I don't want to make it
sound that simple. You've got to be,

615
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:40,840
it's the same thing we talked about,

616
00:40:40,841 --> 00:40:44,980
like if you've got to be far enough
forward that you can understand what's

617
00:40:44,981 --> 00:40:47,530
happening up there and obviously you,

618
00:40:47,531 --> 00:40:49,900
but you don't want to be the guy that's
doing the shooting cause then you've

619
00:40:49,901 --> 00:40:54,430
gone too far forward to actually
be detached and make decisions.

620
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,690
Certainly combat is not
going to be that simple.

621
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,790
The gap then might be any undefended
point or any weekly defended point.

622
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:06,940
It may be any enemy vulnerability.

623
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,670
It might be the enemies of flanks.

624
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,720
The term flank itself
needs some elaboration.

625
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,120
Think of it as a relative thing.

626
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:20,290
John Boyd defines a flank as
that aspect of that aspect.

627
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:24,280
Toward which a force is not
devoting its primary attention.

628
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,710
In other words and fluid warfare,

629
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:31,570
what is one moment the enemy's flank might
the next moment be the enemy's front?

630
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,010
It depends on how he is
directing his attention.

631
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,700
A gap for the infantry could
be an enemy missile site,

632
00:41:37,701 --> 00:41:40,190
manned by troops or not combat oriented.

633
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:44,720
The missile site might be a surface
if you are flying on an airplane,

634
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:49,340
but a gap if you were a light infantry
men who has gotten inside and me lines.

635
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,233
So,

636
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,130
okay,

637
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,750
does that make sense to you?
So if you've got,

638
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:57,850
if you've got a surface to air missile,

639
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,610
okay,

640
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,920
launcher and it,

641
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:05,550
it has a radar radar on it and
it can track aircraft coming in.

642
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,680
And if you're a a fighter aircraft,

643
00:42:07,681 --> 00:42:09,720
you don't want to say what do you want
to stay away from that thing because

644
00:42:09,721 --> 00:42:12,400
it'll get you locked on railroad is
going to fire a heat seeking missile that

645
00:42:12,401 --> 00:42:16,500
you and kill you. So for them it's
a surface. It's a strong point.

646
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:21,060
For an aircraft it's a strong point.
But for a ground troop, they don't put,

647
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:21,541
you know,

648
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:25,410
the highest level troops guarding these
things cause they're in the rear a

649
00:42:25,411 --> 00:42:29,010
little bit. They put like kind of, you
know, some what they call them here. Uh,

650
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:34,280
they're manned by troops
who are not combat oriented.

651
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,710
So that means it's a softer target.
Yeah.

652
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:43,220
Back to the book. Let us say we are
unsuccessful in finding any gaps.

653
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:44,750
Yeah,

654
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:48,800
we may have to create gaps and
there are ways of doing this.

655
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:52,460
So then they talk about the ways you can
do it. You can do it through fire power,

656
00:42:52,461 --> 00:42:55,250
but dropping bombs by suppression,
by assault,

657
00:42:56,390 --> 00:43:00,190
all those different ways to
create gaps with, with, you know,

658
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:03,020
using direct fire to soften up targets.

659
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,560
And then I like these
tactics a little bit better.

660
00:43:06,561 --> 00:43:09,590
Another way of creating gaps
is through supporting attacks.

661
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,780
By attacking one point along the line,

662
00:43:11,781 --> 00:43:16,280
we may divert the enemy from another point
and by drawing them off, create a gap.

663
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:22,040
Again, this isn't linear terms for
instructional purposes, for simplicity,

664
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,470
but do not get a linear mindset.

665
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:29,450
Sometimes a less costly way of creating
a gap is through deception by causing

666
00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:33,410
the enemy to think that we will attack
at one point there by enticing him to

667
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:35,480
draw his forces off from another point.

668
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,460
And when he attack that point
where he has weakened herself.

669
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:45,120
But what do we do about
surfaces that his strong points,

670
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:49,950
sometimes they are best bypassed
once the enemy has been bypassed,

671
00:43:49,951 --> 00:43:53,670
his strong point may be cutoff from its
support and in that way his strong point

672
00:43:53,671 --> 00:43:58,440
eventually withers away and becomes a
weak point, which we can attack later.

673
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:02,923
Okay.

674
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:03,581
You know,

675
00:44:03,581 --> 00:44:07,690
we talk a lot in here about not
attacking people's defensible positions.

676
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,310
And this is just a classic, another
way of saying that, you know, some we,

677
00:44:11,311 --> 00:44:13,240
we talk about people with got the ego,

678
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,150
the big ego and how you don't
want to confront that ego. Well,

679
00:44:16,151 --> 00:44:20,170
if you can bypass the ego, eventually
the ego doesn't become a factor anymore.

680
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:23,440
And that's the same thing when
you're doing ground combat.

681
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:26,520
Back to the book.

682
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,790
There are certain problems presented
by the concept of surfaces and gaps,

683
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:33,180
especially to commanders who are
to slow moving forms of combat.

684
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:37,860
One is that the commander will not
always know where all his people are.

685
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,660
In the Marine Corps.

686
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,830
We become used to being accountable at
all times for knowing exactly where every

687
00:44:43,831 --> 00:44:48,831
man is in this faster moving form of
combat to do so would be impossible.

688
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:55,120
Your subordinates or finding the gaps and
exploiting them. So you've got you've,

689
00:44:55,121 --> 00:44:56,280
you're a control freak.

690
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:00,930
You're not going to be able to pull this
off cause I'm saying well where are you

691
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:04,260
echo, where are you echo where are you
know, echoes out there. He's working,

692
00:45:04,261 --> 00:45:07,830
he's finding some gaps to get through,
not know exactly where he is.

693
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:12,000
Another problem is that
artillery in air might not be,

694
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,480
may not be controlled as closely as is
possible and slowing slower moving forms

695
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:22,350
of combat. So you start to deal with
the problems of, of air support.

696
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:27,390
And artillery is a little trickier to
use because you have people moving around

697
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,060
the battlefield and you're not sure
where everyone is and that makes it very

698
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:32,430
difficult because you obviously don't
want to drop bombs on your own people.

699
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,650
Another problem associated with the
concept of surfaces and gaps is that as we

700
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:40,440
penetrate deeply,
often on narrow fronts,

701
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:45,420
our flanks become exposed.
There are however compensating factors,

702
00:45:45,421 --> 00:45:48,660
again related to speed,
we are moving quickly.

703
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:50,700
The enemy is always off balance.

704
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:54,750
Remember the old adage
there is security in speed,

705
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:59,480
so in other words, as you
penetrate into a, into a zone,

706
00:45:59,481 --> 00:46:01,910
you're going to be exposed a little bit,
but if you're moving fast,

707
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,200
you can deal with that exposure.

708
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:13,800
Critics of these faster moving forms of
combat characterized by initiative at

709
00:46:13,801 --> 00:46:16,980
the low level fear that
they will lead groups,

710
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:22,190
two groups of men moving willy nilly
about the battlefield and that commanders

711
00:46:22,231 --> 00:46:25,530
will lose control. So people say,
Oh, you know, if I give so much,

712
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:29,670
so much initiative at the low level,
if I'm going to lose control of it,

713
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,460
then people are going to be running
around like chickens with their heads cut

714
00:46:32,461 --> 00:46:34,530
off this need not be.

715
00:46:34,531 --> 00:46:38,790
So if the concept of surfaces
and gaps is employed properly,

716
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:43,410
it will not be. So that is why we
have control measures the boundary,

717
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:46,470
the limit of advanced the
phase line can still be used.

718
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:50,580
It must be remembered that these control
measures should serve their function

719
00:46:50,581 --> 00:46:53,970
but not be rigid lines that
cannot be changed or ignored.

720
00:46:53,971 --> 00:46:55,530
When the situation changes,

721
00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:00,300
they should be kept to a minimum
and must always be flexible.

722
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:04,890
The tactics must never follow the
control measures. On the contrary,

723
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:10,040
the control measures must follow the
tactics and the tactics must always be

724
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:12,060
based on the enemy.

725
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,990
Other concepts that will be
discussed in the chapters ahead,

726
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,570
especially that of the main
effort gives us meaning,

727
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:25,800
gives us means of keeping control over
our troops and preventing a situation

728
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:29,920
where they can be said to be moving
willy nilly about the battlefield.

729
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,960
So decentralized command it.

730
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:38,050
It is challenging and if you don't
do it right, you will have chaos.

731
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:44,970
So now we get into the next section and
it does say lecture again, but again,

732
00:47:44,971 --> 00:47:46,770
I'm not here to lecture anybody.
I don't think I,

733
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:51,780
I don't think I can pull that off.
The concept,

734
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:55,080
this one,
this section is called mission tactics.

735
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:02,280
The concept of mission
tactics like surfaces and gaps
must always be at work in

736
00:48:02,281 --> 00:48:03,114
battle.

737
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:08,810
The name is the name is derived
from the German Alf trags tactic,

738
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,840
which means literally mission tactics.

739
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:17,220
It is no accident that the
name includes the word tactics.

740
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:22,670
Assigning a mission and depending on
subordinates to carry it out constitutes

741
00:48:23,041 --> 00:48:28,041
the tactic to allow the subordinate to
decide on his own initiative what to do

742
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:35,550
is the means of getting the most
appropriate decisions made on the spot and

743
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:39,900
acted on more rapidly than the
enemy can respond to your actions.

744
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,820
Got to get your subordinate leadership
to lead. You want them to lead.

745
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,830
This is the account of
Prince Frederick Charles,

746
00:48:52,831 --> 00:48:56,460
who is giving a tongue lashing to one
of his majors for committing a tactical

747
00:48:56,461 --> 00:48:58,440
blunder in defense of his action.

748
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:02,760
The major explained that he was only
following orders in the Prussian army.

749
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:06,600
The major reminded the prints and order
from a senior officer was tantamount to

750
00:49:06,601 --> 00:49:10,110
an order from the king.
The prince was unimpressed.

751
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:15,270
His reply to the major was the king made
you a major because he thought you were

752
00:49:15,271 --> 00:49:18,870
smart enough to know
when not to obey orders.

753
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,410
Then that is the essence
of mission tactics.

754
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:28,450
The subordinate decides what to do
even if even if it means that the order

755
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,110
issued by his senior now
should be changed or adjusted.

756
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:34,780
The mission assigned is sacred.

757
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:39,940
The mission is the output that the
commander wants. That does not change,

758
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:45,150
but how that output is to be achieved may
change and it is up to the intelligent

759
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,240
subordinate to decide
whether or not it has

760
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:59,760
total freedom for the
subordinate leadership to
figure out how they want to make

761
00:50:03,191 --> 00:50:06,330
this happen. They know what
they need to get done, but they,

762
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:09,580
they have the freedom to figure out
how they're going to make it happen.

763
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:12,730
Back to the book,
there is a classic example.

764
00:50:12,731 --> 00:50:16,390
Use Time and time again and introducing
the student to mission tactics.

765
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:19,480
It is simple and a value
so it will be used again.

766
00:50:19,481 --> 00:50:22,570
Here the subordinate is giving the mission
of getting his unit across the river.

767
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:26,440
Getting these unit across the river
is the output. The senior desires,

768
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,540
the that he has been given
crosses the nearest bridge.

769
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:32,960
The junior commander arrives at the
site to find that the bridge has been

770
00:50:32,961 --> 00:50:37,640
destroyed. He does not stop. He
does not wait for new orders.

771
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:40,010
He does not request permission
to change his route.

772
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:44,450
He goes to the nearest Ford several
kilometers distance, and he crosses there.

773
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:48,470
He informed the senior, of course, as
soon as he can, but he does not wait.

774
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:53,360
Remember, mission orders are necessary
to give the tempo of operations,

775
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:58,490
the rapidity that it must have if we
are to keep the enemy off balance.

776
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:02,840
So that's a very simple example.
I tell Echo, hey, I need your,

777
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:06,230
I need your troops across that river.
Go across that bridge. You get there,

778
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:09,360
the bridges out. You're like,
oh, I'm still going to get
across the river. Here's,

779
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,560
let's find a put into the place we
can go across or let's make it happen.

780
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:15,980
And you're gonna make it happen.
Not going to bother me.

781
00:51:15,981 --> 00:51:18,850
You're not going to call me back.
[inaudible] hey, the bridges out.

782
00:51:18,851 --> 00:51:21,830
What you want me to do now that
something that, this is a little bit,

783
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:26,900
this is a little bit simplified because
the reality is if you are going to start

784
00:51:26,901 --> 00:51:29,660
moving kilometers away from
where I anticipated you being,

785
00:51:29,661 --> 00:51:32,030
you need to tell me that you're moving.
You need to tell me,

786
00:51:32,031 --> 00:51:35,060
cause I might have other friendly
units in the area that might,

787
00:51:35,061 --> 00:51:39,380
IX don't expect you, I might have be
dropping bombs in that area. So this is,

788
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:43,190
this is actually leaving out some critical
coordination that does have to happen,

789
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:47,860
but the initiative to make
it happen should happen.
Yeah, it seems like you, um,

790
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,130
like in the, in the process
of that decentralized command,

791
00:51:52,131 --> 00:51:54,800
the person carrying out the order is,

792
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:58,760
it's kind of tis discretion how much
he's going to deviate when something

793
00:51:58,761 --> 00:52:01,190
changes. Like he can't, he's,
of course he's going to deviate.

794
00:52:01,191 --> 00:52:05,030
He's going to make those adjustments,
but you don't want to deviate too much.

795
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:08,780
Right. And honestly, if I was to
give you the directions, hey echo,

796
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:10,490
I need you to go on a car.
I need you cross the river.

797
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:14,240
I would literally give you some parameters
to work within. I'd say, don't go,

798
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:17,960
don't go further south in this area then
this road and don't go further north

799
00:52:17,961 --> 00:52:19,550
and this, you can do whatever
you want inside of here.

800
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,880
So now you can do it and you can do
whatever you want inside that box. Yeah.

801
00:52:22,881 --> 00:52:24,620
And how you always talk about you'll,
you'll say like,

802
00:52:24,621 --> 00:52:26,600
why are you going across
the river as well?

803
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:34,520
And speaking of y, and here's
another example of mission orders.

804
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:37,160
This is an actual example.

805
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:42,910
Seize control of route six west of the
muddy river in order to destroy enemy

806
00:52:43,581 --> 00:52:47,930
forces, attempting to escape from
company Bravo's zone of action.

807
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,930
So it's telling you the why,
that's what the,

808
00:52:53,931 --> 00:52:57,020
in order to his notice
in the mission order,

809
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:01,430
the phrase in order to that is a very
important phrase and usually ought to go

810
00:53:01,431 --> 00:53:02,264
in the mission order.

811
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:06,110
There's no rule that every mission
order contain the phrase in order to,

812
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:09,350
if you were told attack the enemy company
that you see in front of you would

813
00:53:09,351 --> 00:53:13,850
probably be highly superfluous
to tell you why they are there.

814
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:18,680
They are a threat. Why waste the
breath, but usually your mission order,

815
00:53:18,681 --> 00:53:20,930
we'll have the ability
to endure time better.

816
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:25,560
If you explained the subordinate
why he is carrying the mission out.

817
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:29,400
So you called this echo, turn into little
tactical genius over there, aren't you?

818
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:34,350
In order to,
this gives the order,

819
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:38,800
the quality that Erich von
Man Stein called longterm.

820
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:42,930
It can endure the test of time. Your
commander can lose communication with you,

821
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:47,550
yet you can still carry out his intent
because you know what he wanted and you

822
00:53:47,551 --> 00:53:51,570
can continue to act within his intent
for a long time without checking back.

823
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:57,680
Understanding the why as briefed
by Lieutenant Colonel Echocharles.

824
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:02,080
Okay.

825
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,620
Fixed rules are not appropriate
in instructing how to us,

826
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:07,300
how to assign missions.

827
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:11,980
Too often students reject good ideas about
tactics because they cannot get their

828
00:54:11,981 --> 00:54:16,981
thoughts to fit the format of the
operation order that is being demanded.

829
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:23,010
The important thing is that the mission
be clear compared to clarity format is

830
00:54:24,911 --> 00:54:28,000
of little or no consequence.
And this is,

831
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:33,160
we talk about it in an extreme ownership,
these massive PowerPoint briefs that,

832
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:35,800
I mean hundreds literally,
you know, a hundred,

833
00:54:35,801 --> 00:54:39,100
150 slides to try and make the,

834
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:45,190
to try and brief a mission when in the
leaders would waste so much time trying

835
00:54:45,191 --> 00:54:48,430
to put these briefs together and,
and they would,

836
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,260
they wouldn't do the planning
where they're supposed to be doing.

837
00:54:50,261 --> 00:54:55,261
They wouldn't be thinking they be building
PowerPoint slides and I've just had

838
00:54:55,391 --> 00:54:59,260
to get these guys to think and stop,
stop working on the,

839
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:02,040
and I'm trying to match your font chop,

840
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:06,010
trying to equalize the Hughes on each
slide to make it look pretty. No,

841
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:08,350
don't care.
What I want you to do is think,

842
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:10,990
and I want clear clarity of mission
as the most important thing.

843
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:14,710
The matter of fact, I had
one guy was running training
and, and a guy says to me,

844
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:18,310
it's one of the, one of the tasks you new
commanders. And he says, Hey, you know,

845
00:55:18,311 --> 00:55:21,940
what is it? What is it that you're looking
for in the brief? And he's, you know,

846
00:55:21,941 --> 00:55:25,720
trying to figure out how many slides do
I want to see and what format do I want

847
00:55:25,721 --> 00:55:26,710
to see?
And I said,

848
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:31,150
what I want for the brief is that
your men understand the operation.

849
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:33,283
Boom.

850
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,560
Back to the book, the
subordinate receiving that
order must be more talented.

851
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,860
Amateur troops, awkward, clumsy,

852
00:55:44,861 --> 00:55:48,920
untrained troops cannot be expected
to carry out mission orders. Why?

853
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:53,690
Because as a result of their lack of
experience, they must be told what to do.

854
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:58,910
Only the professional experience leader
can know what to do without being told

855
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,260
what to do. Because we in the Marine
Corps, set our standards high.

856
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:06,230
We expected our subordinates will train
until they can perform under mission

857
00:56:06,231 --> 00:56:10,880
orders. So just, I don't know if I made
this clear or if I breezed over this park.

858
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:14,510
Mission orders is exactly what we're
talking about when it comes to, hey,

859
00:56:14,511 --> 00:56:19,490
just tell the person, this is what I
need done and this is why I want it done.

860
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:23,770
You figured out, as opposed to telling
them exactly what you them to do.

861
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:27,880
Commander's intent. Yes,
indeed. Commander's intent,

862
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:35,030
burdens of responsibility increase on
both sides on the part of the senior

863
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:37,140
committed.
So when you're doing mission orders,

864
00:56:37,141 --> 00:56:41,490
the burden of responsibility increases
on the part of the senior commander and

865
00:56:41,491 --> 00:56:46,440
on the part of the subordinate look first
at the senior commander operating with

866
00:56:46,441 --> 00:56:49,800
mission orders,
his orders must be perfectly clear.

867
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:54,780
The onus is on the senior to define to
the junior what must be accomplished

868
00:56:54,781 --> 00:56:56,520
without telling him how to do it.

869
00:56:57,270 --> 00:57:01,650
The onus is not on the junior to
ferret out what his commander wants.

870
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:06,900
The senior must state what he wants,
otherwise he should not expect to get it.

871
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:09,360
Now, I actually, when I,
when I teach people this,

872
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:12,480
I tell them that the onus
is on the junior. And if,

873
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:16,290
if I tell you to do something and you
don't understand why you're doing it and

874
00:57:16,291 --> 00:57:19,500
you don't understand what my intent is
and you still go on the field and try and

875
00:57:19,501 --> 00:57:23,910
do it, I blame you. I mean, it's my fault
too, but we're both taking ownership.

876
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:26,340
Might even say we're taking
extreme ownership of the situation.

877
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,720
But really if your boss isn't telling
you why your why your why they're telling

878
00:57:30,721 --> 00:57:33,480
you to do something, you just
raise your hand and ask, Hey boss,

879
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,760
what's your objective here?
What's your overall intent?

880
00:57:35,761 --> 00:57:36,750
What's the commander's intent?

881
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,270
Because I want to make sure if
I lose communications with you,

882
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,990
I can continue to execute
towards your desired end state.

883
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:46,030
That's what we're looking for.
Thank you.

884
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:48,390
Okay.

885
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:51,960
An additional burden of responsibility
on the seniors that he must train his

886
00:57:51,961 --> 00:57:55,020
subordinates and his unit
to operate as a team.

887
00:57:55,620 --> 00:58:00,620
They are not going to be able to perform
mission orders without training another

888
00:58:01,111 --> 00:58:04,530
new boarding of responsibilities that
he must expect his subordinates to make

889
00:58:04,531 --> 00:58:07,560
mistakes.
He may not expect zero defects.

890
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:12,030
Wars are won by people, not
machines. People make mistakes.

891
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:16,350
If people are more afraid of making
mistakes than they are of exercising

892
00:58:16,351 --> 00:58:19,980
initiative now and then they will not
take risks and they will not exercise

893
00:58:19,981 --> 00:58:24,420
initiative. Furthermore,
they will not win in war.

894
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:29,830
Perhaps the most important
new responsibility that
is placed on the commander

895
00:58:29,831 --> 00:58:33,730
who gives mission orders is that
he must trust his subordinates.

896
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:38,380
If trust breaks down,
the whole system breaks down.

897
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,920
So people ask me about
trust from time to time.

898
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:46,930
And it's absolutely, and I use, I
talk about relationships, The r word,

899
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:49,090
and that's what, that's
what, that's what it is.

900
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:52,720
And Lafe and I talked about the other
day on the podcast is that just building

901
00:58:52,721 --> 00:58:57,550
trust, how the one of the best
ways to build trust as give it,

902
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:59,830
I give it.
And so that's what it goes back and forth.

903
00:58:59,831 --> 00:59:02,470
And in the military you do that when
you're in the training environment,

904
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:07,720
when there's no risk or very,
very tiny risk of life and limb,

905
00:59:07,721 --> 00:59:09,480
there's no strategic lift and you're not,
you'd risk,

906
00:59:09,481 --> 00:59:11,920
you're not gonna lose the war.
So I'm going to let you run with stuff.

907
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:14,740
I want you to learn. I want you
to take risks. And if you fail,

908
00:59:14,741 --> 00:59:19,000
if you screw something up, I don't try
and fire you. We try and learn from it.

909
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:23,930
And that encourages you to take
initiative and keep getting after it.

910
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:29,933
Okay.

911
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:35,030
Now the, the, we're moving
to the next section.

912
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:36,780
Yeah.

913
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:38,970
Which is called the main effort.

914
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:45,620
The commander in making his plan must
determine what and where his main effort

915
00:59:46,681 --> 00:59:51,570
is in every operation, whether
it be offensive, defensive,

916
00:59:51,571 --> 00:59:52,520
or withdrawal.

917
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:56,790
This main effort should be
specified in the operation order.

918
00:59:56,910 --> 01:00:01,890
It should always be clearly
stated in paragraph three
a the concept of operation.

919
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:05,610
There can only be one main effort.

920
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:10,080
When you start giving two or
three or a three part main effort,

921
01:00:10,290 --> 01:00:13,800
you'd better look back at it
because the chances are you do,

922
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:17,880
you have not made up your mind
what you are trying to do.

923
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:23,110
So if you're trying to plan a
mission, you, you're telling,

924
01:00:23,111 --> 01:00:26,320
you're telling people there's three main
things we're trying to get done. No,

925
01:00:26,321 --> 01:00:28,180
wrong. Yep. There should be one.

926
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:32,970
Yup. Yeah, in message, convenience.

927
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:37,890
Um, actually I think it's the newspaper
writing. They call it burying the lead.

928
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:41,970
So like your main story has to,
you know,

929
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:46,140
you can't have three main stories in one
article. Got It. Because, and you know,

930
01:00:46,141 --> 01:00:48,360
one story is going to have
cool details, right? Right.

931
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:52,380
But you start spending a bunch
of time on these cool details.

932
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,870
They call that burying the lead.
It's a bad deal done

933
01:00:56,150 --> 01:01:00,410
do that. Don't do the newspaper business
and don't do that on battlefield.

934
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:06,410
Every unit commander down to the company
commander will always assign a main

935
01:01:06,411 --> 01:01:11,411
effort and sometimes even
a platoon commander should
the entire command must be

936
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:16,070
aware of what and where
the main effort is.

937
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,730
The commander can change
the main effort at any time.

938
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:25,310
This is what gives the operation its
fluidity in in. This is one of the

939
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:28,910
pretty common issues that we run.

940
01:01:28,911 --> 01:01:32,570
It ran into it when I was
running training run into it.

941
01:01:32,571 --> 01:01:35,480
Now in the business world where you've
worked with a company and they're not,

942
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:37,280
they're not assigning a main effort.

943
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:39,800
There were concentrating on 14
different things at the same time.

944
01:01:39,801 --> 01:01:41,120
They don't prioritize and execute this.

945
01:01:41,121 --> 01:01:43,250
This is another form of
prioritize and execute

946
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:48,470
and that's a problem because if
you're trying to do 14 things at once,

947
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,660
you're going to not
accomplish any of them.

948
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:55,550
The German word for main effort is shared,

949
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:58,970
pumped anytime in your readings.

950
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:01,930
When you see that and often you
will see it written in metallics.

951
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:04,220
The German word strip punked.
Take Note,

952
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:07,700
because it is one of the most important
underlying concepts in everything the

953
01:02:07,701 --> 01:02:08,600
Germans do.

954
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:13,910
Make the main effort where
the enemy least expects you.

955
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:19,100
Make the enemy. Make the main
effort where the enemy is weak.

956
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:24,390
Be prepared to be surprised.
So let's go. I gotta,

957
01:02:24,391 --> 01:02:27,000
I gotta stop right there.
It's interesting.

958
01:02:27,001 --> 01:02:31,560
You know when you see the big fortified
area of the enemy, you see, okay,

959
01:02:31,561 --> 01:02:35,760
we're going to, we better, we better
attack that hard. No wrong answer.

960
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:38,130
That's a surface.
We're looking for gaps.

961
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:41,700
So don't make the main
effort that the strong point,

962
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:44,550
make it the weak point back to the book.

963
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:47,760
Be Be prepared to be surprised.

964
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:52,290
Be Leery of the council.
Do not ever be surprised in war.

965
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:57,210
You will be surprised. The task
is to learn to deal with surprise.

966
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:01,230
If what you thought would be an enemy,
weakness becomes the enemy strength.

967
01:03:01,231 --> 01:03:05,340
You should not be disrupted.
If your taxes tactics are fluid,

968
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:06,990
you can deal with surprise.

969
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:10,380
You will shift your main effort to
enemy weakness and go on through.

970
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,750
That is how the main
effort works in the office.

971
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:15,920
Yeah,

972
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:20,120
fluidity. Remember we've been hearing
a lot about in the Vietnam war,

973
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:23,390
the Viet Cong were too rigid.
They would just try,

974
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:25,670
their plan didn't have the fluidity.

975
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:30,560
The main efforts should
be directed against enemy
weakness, not enemies. Strength.

976
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:33,020
Here you see the interconnection
between the concepts,

977
01:03:33,021 --> 01:03:36,470
the con connection between the concept
of the main effort and the concept of

978
01:03:36,471 --> 01:03:40,280
surfaces and gaps. All the concepts
work together at the same time.

979
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:44,450
The main effort cannot be understood in
isolation from surfaces and gaps because

980
01:03:44,451 --> 01:03:46,460
it is directed against enemy weakness.

981
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:52,683
Okay,

982
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:53,890
and another,

983
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:58,030
another one of the four laws combat
that we talk about in the book.

984
01:03:58,031 --> 01:04:00,610
Extreme ownership is simplicity.

985
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,940
Simple back to the book.

986
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:07,780
Even the principal of simplicity can be
recognized in the concept of the main

987
01:04:07,781 --> 01:04:11,710
effort. Instead of trying to do 10
different things, we are focusing on one.

988
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:15,100
There will be many other efforts
going on at the same time,

989
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:19,180
but all in some way directed at
making the main efforts succeed.

990
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:24,640
So what do you gain from this main effort?
You gain direction,

991
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:28,510
you great, you gain
fluidity, you gain speed,

992
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:32,260
and you prevent dissipating your
efforts all over the battlefield.

993
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:36,610
The way the polls did when
the Germans invaded Poland,

994
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:40,030
they tried to defend their
entire 800 mile front.

995
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:44,710
There was no main effort and by
trying to be strong everywhere,

996
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:46,540
they weren't fact strong.

997
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:51,550
Nowhere this trying to cover all the
bases is a common error in the amateur

998
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:57,400
commanders plan. It is a symptom
of avoidance of decision making,

999
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:01,030
avoidance of decision making.
So if you're not saying, hey,

1000
01:05:01,031 --> 01:05:03,790
here's what we're going to focus on,
your, you're just, wow, I'm going to wait.

1001
01:05:03,791 --> 01:05:06,400
I don't want to decide yet.
No, I'm not ready to commit.

1002
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:11,770
By establishing a main effort,
you make a clear decision.

1003
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:17,790
You obviate the necessity for junior
officers to keep asking for guidance.

1004
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,280
If they know their commanders made effort,

1005
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:25,630
they can continue to operate even though
communications may be cut and they can

1006
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:30,631
continue to operate at a
high tempo because they need
not keep checking back for

1007
01:05:30,641 --> 01:05:31,474
new orders.

1008
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:40,370
And here we get to a another something
you might recognize from from our book,

1009
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:44,610
extreme ownership.
When the commander has made this decision,

1010
01:05:44,611 --> 01:05:46,860
he has done something very necessary.

1011
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,980
He has done something very ethical.

1012
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:55,490
He is assumed and taken responsibility
for what will happen if the battle goes

1013
01:05:56,791 --> 01:05:59,910
awry.
He cannot blame his subordinates.

1014
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:01,830
He can only blame himself.

1015
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:06,980
It was key who decided what was to be
done and designated a main effort in order

1016
01:06:08,281 --> 01:06:09,990
to do it.
Therefore,

1017
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:14,250
it takes courage and moral character
decides to select a main effort.

1018
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:19,730
That is why the weak commander and
the amateur so often fail to do this.

1019
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:21,881
In fact,

1020
01:06:21,881 --> 01:06:26,670
the weak commander will actively avoid
choosing a main effort is very convenient

1021
01:06:26,671 --> 01:06:30,870
for the commander weekend character to
avoid selecting the main effort because

1022
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:35,490
if the battle goes on favorably,
he can blame someone else for the mistake.

1023
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:41,630
The commander who has taken the stand and
selected his own main effort cannot do

1024
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:44,880
this. Therefore, in a sense,

1025
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:48,810
the main effort is a moral commitment.

1026
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:55,640
Taking some ownership by selecting the
main effort and you'd get a dig that,

1027
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:58,813
okay,

1028
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,420
the next concept in, again, you know him,

1029
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:07,240
I'm cruising through this book like I
always do. Only reading, I don't know,

1030
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:11,170
probably a very small percentage of it,

1031
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:15,340
15% and there's a ton in here.

1032
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:20,080
It actually has some very cool uh,

1033
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:24,850
like exercises where it
gives you a scenario that's
happening and you go through

1034
01:07:24,851 --> 01:07:27,190
when you figured out what you would
do and it gives you a good solution.

1035
01:07:27,191 --> 01:07:29,560
So it's got, it's got, it's
a great book to look at.

1036
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:35,920
The next lecture
is called the concept of the objective.

1037
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:41,350
According to this chair do according to
the Joint Chiefs of staff publication

1038
01:07:41,351 --> 01:07:44,020
number one dictionary of
military and associated terms.

1039
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:49,560
The objective is the physical object
of the action taken a definite tactical

1040
01:07:50,771 --> 01:07:55,771
feature seizure and are holding of which
is essential to the commanders plan.

1041
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,140
That definition is clear enough.

1042
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:05,650
Bazell Odell heart would have disagreed
with the JCS definition had one point in

1043
01:08:05,651 --> 01:08:06,370
his writings.

1044
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:10,900
Ladelle heart stated the only
real objective is the enemy.

1045
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:17,210
The Dell hearts statement is also quite
clear and especially when we realize

1046
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:20,390
that whether we are attacking or
defending the problem is always the enemy.

1047
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:23,450
Once the enemy has
taken out of the action,

1048
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:26,810
defending and attacking
or no longer necessary.

1049
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:33,793
Now

1050
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:38,640
the, the, the, I guess
the controversy here,

1051
01:08:38,641 --> 01:08:39,810
if we could call it that,

1052
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:45,240
is the objective not being a
specific piece of terrain. It's the,

1053
01:08:45,241 --> 01:08:46,890
the objective is the enemy.

1054
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:50,570
But that being said,

1055
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:57,800
the terrain of course is
extremely important. We must
use it to gain advantage,

1056
01:08:58,010 --> 01:09:00,650
but the object of the attack is the enemy.

1057
01:09:00,651 --> 01:09:05,060
The objective must be to take the
enemy out of action to destroy him,

1058
01:09:05,061 --> 01:09:08,870
to disarm him. We cannot not do that
simply by seizing a piece of training,

1059
01:09:08,871 --> 01:09:09,650
holding it.

1060
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:14,060
We must be prepared to move continually
wherever necessary to confuse and

1061
01:09:14,061 --> 01:09:16,700
disrupt him through a
combination of fire and movement.

1062
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:24,250
When the term objective appears,
it means an aiming point.

1063
01:09:24,610 --> 01:09:28,780
That towards which we direct our efforts
in order to best use the terrain to

1064
01:09:28,781 --> 01:09:31,990
accomplish our final goal,
the destruction of the enemy,

1065
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:39,940
the ability to wisely select an objective
is the mark of a good commander.

1066
01:09:40,330 --> 01:09:45,330
The inability is the mark of an amateur
and history is replete with examples of

1067
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:47,710
poorly selected objectives.

1068
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:53,140
There were hills fought for bravely by
marines in Vietnam after they ceased

1069
01:09:53,141 --> 01:09:55,090
being of any tactical value.

1070
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:58,420
Lives were thrown away
from meaningless terrain.

1071
01:09:58,570 --> 01:10:03,430
Terrain that did not meet either of
the two main criteria for selecting an

1072
01:10:03,431 --> 01:10:08,110
objective. The two main
criteria are one that is loot,

1073
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:12,580
that it'd be useful to you
or to dear to your enemy.

1074
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:15,070
If it is neither one of these,

1075
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:20,840
it is probably not worth the life of a
single marine and good commander will

1076
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,090
therefore select terrain
that is useful to him.

1077
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:30,690
The great commander will have the ability
to select terrain that is dear to the

1078
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,744
enemy.

1079
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:41,180
In the final concept is
the concept of the reserve,

1080
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:47,840
General JFC follower of the British army.

1081
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:52,160
The original author of the nine principles
of war that the US army was to adopt

1082
01:10:52,161 --> 01:10:56,270
in the 1920s once stated that of
all the principles he developed,

1083
01:10:56,271 --> 01:10:58,790
the most important was economy of force.

1084
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:04,100
He reasoned that whichever side still
had forces left after the other sides had

1085
01:11:04,101 --> 01:11:05,840
been committed,
was bound to win.

1086
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:10,610
Napoleon seems to have had similar
thoughts when he observed that whoever's

1087
01:11:10,611 --> 01:11:15,611
still had his reserve remaining after
his enemy had committed his reserve would

1088
01:11:15,931 --> 01:11:16,764
win the battle.

1089
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:24,070
And here's another quote in here from
Napoleon that I think when they're talking

1090
01:11:25,041 --> 01:11:28,520
about committing, and it talks about
your mindset on the battlefield

1091
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:32,633
from Napoleon,

1092
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:38,210
if I appear to be always ready to reply
to everything it is because before

1093
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:43,200
undertaking anything,
I have meditated for a long time.

1094
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,960
I have foreseen what might happen.

1095
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:52,440
It is not a spirit which suddenly reveals
to me what I have to say or do in a

1096
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:55,770
circumstances, in a circumstance,
unexpected by others.

1097
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:59,130
It is reflection,
a meditation.

1098
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:05,590
So Napoleon, he was good to have these
quick reactions and everyone says, wow,

1099
01:12:05,591 --> 01:12:09,040
he must've just had this incredible,
you know, he's calling a spirit.

1100
01:12:09,041 --> 01:12:12,280
This comes to him and says,
Hey, move these guys over
here. Hey, assault that flank.

1101
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:16,330
No. Here. He fought through this thing for
hours and he said, Oh, if they do this,

1102
01:12:16,331 --> 01:12:19,420
I'm gonna do that. If they come over
here, I'll move you. Ready over here.

1103
01:12:19,850 --> 01:12:20,683
Hmm.

1104
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,073
Preparation.

1105
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:29,570
What Napoleon was saying was that thorough
thought in advance prepared him to

1106
01:12:29,731 --> 01:12:34,290
make split second decisions when
the situation suddenly changed.

1107
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:39,143
Okay.

1108
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,113
Preparation.

1109
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,710
Preparation is key.

1110
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:45,613
Yeah.

1111
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:48,150
Now.

1112
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:53,150
That wraps up the book and I hope that
it provides some reminders and some

1113
01:12:53,461 --> 01:12:57,480
insight to people not only to the
war fighters out on the battlefield,

1114
01:12:57,481 --> 01:12:58,680
but as I said in the beginning,

1115
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:03,920
I hope it provides some details
into dealing with humans,

1116
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:08,490
with people and problems
in the business world,

1117
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:13,350
in leadership positions on
that, Jiu Jitsu, Matt, in life,

1118
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:18,210
whatever you're doing or whatever
you're trying to get done.

1119
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:23,630
Think of how you can use maneuver
warfare to make it happen.

1120
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:32,130
I guess we cannot
go over to some,

1121
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:37,930
some questions from the interwebs and
I guess before we go to the interwebs,

1122
01:13:40,890 --> 01:13:42,810
maybe you could tell us
about the inner webs and

1123
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:49,550
what we can do to support support
by being on the interwebs.

1124
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,910
If you're on the interwebs and you're in
the mood to support this podcast and or

1125
01:13:53,911 --> 01:13:57,750
yourself
with supplementation,

1126
01:13:57,751 --> 01:14:02,130
go to on it.com/jocko
get on it.

1127
01:14:02,131 --> 01:14:05,820
Supplements are the best
ones. I like that idea. Yeah,

1128
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:10,660
that's a good idea. Krill oil for
sure, for your joints, get tough.

1129
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:11,980
Bring some of that Alpha

1130
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:16,750
brainy shroom tech sport
mode. Yeah, shroom tech sport.

1131
01:14:16,751 --> 01:14:20,320
If you're into performance,
physical activity performance,

1132
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:24,670
if you feel you need a little turbo
boost. Yeah, it was funny. Remember

1133
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:31,060
Tim Kennedy put it in like real, real
good terms in my opinion when he use like,

1134
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:34,480
oh yeah, when I took the
shroom tech, it's kind of like,

1135
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:37,840
cause okay, so you don't want to
get confused and be like, Hey,

1136
01:14:37,841 --> 01:14:39,420
I'm gonna take the shroom tech in.
It's like a,

1137
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:42,490
like a caffeine boost or something.
You know, you don't because it's not,

1138
01:14:42,491 --> 01:14:46,210
that's not so it's an, and he put it in
these terms where he's like, you know, he,

1139
01:14:46,211 --> 01:14:49,360
you go a few rounds, you go five,
six, seven, eight, you know,

1140
01:14:49,470 --> 01:14:52,360
however many rounds and everyone's like
real poop. But then you're kind of like,

1141
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:56,840
I can go a few more routes. And really
that is exactly how it is this room.

1142
01:14:57,090 --> 01:14:59,410
But when you're hitting towards
the end of the round or whatever,

1143
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:01,630
it's like you feel
solid, you know, it just,

1144
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:05,960
I guess apparently what it does is it
helps you utilize your oxygen consumption.

1145
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:08,530
You'll find a site or whatever. I mean,
obviously you're talking about Jujitsu,

1146
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:11,500
which for those people that don't
train Jujitsu, which you should,

1147
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:14,230
but if you don't,
well you should,

1148
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:19,520
but you are also going to keep working
out and you have the, you know, you,

1149
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:23,770
so sort of a metabolic conditioning
type type of workout situation going on.

1150
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:24,690
That's true.

1151
01:15:24,690 --> 01:15:28,680
Remember how I was telling you I did my
met come metabolic conditioning after I

1152
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:33,160
like normal lifting. So person doing the
reverse of that lately. Really. I Dunno,

1153
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:37,390
I would advise Alan super warmed
up. I'm dripping with sweat. Yeah.

1154
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:42,670
And I feel really good and I figure
maybe the opposite will happen because we

1155
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:44,710
both know if you go with your,

1156
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:48,580
with your strength movements first you
tick a little bit off your met construct.

1157
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:51,010
Right? Yeah. If, if you do.

1158
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:55,240
And so that way when you do the metcon
fresh, you feel like Superman, right?

1159
01:15:55,241 --> 01:15:57,010
Cause you're yeah.
Blasted your muscles out.

1160
01:15:57,550 --> 01:15:59,350
So I've been doing the reverse though.
What?

1161
01:15:59,351 --> 01:16:04,351
I'm doing the metcon type first and then
I just breathe it out and then I get

1162
01:16:05,411 --> 01:16:07,820
into the heavy stuff.
Yeah. And I dig it on.

1163
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:11,500
The only reason I say I dig it
because you're a savage like that.

1164
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:15,130
But consider cause those are two,
well it depends.

1165
01:16:15,131 --> 01:16:18,460
It depends on what kind of lifting
you're doing. So let's say if not,

1166
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:20,830
well if you're lifting like
for strength or or you know,

1167
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:22,150
muscle growth or whatever,

1168
01:16:22,151 --> 01:16:27,151
you should do that first because the
results that you seek are inline with you

1169
01:16:27,341 --> 01:16:31,810
having full energy. You lifting. I agree
with you. I actually think you're correct.

1170
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:33,730
And the METCON isn't,

1171
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,880
the results of the metcon is for you
to recover from conditioning. So he,

1172
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:41,620
it's muscular conditioning. So if you're
tired going in, that's more conditioning.

1173
01:16:41,621 --> 01:16:45,130
You have to recover from better exercise.
So it slowed essentially. But Hey,

1174
01:16:45,131 --> 01:16:48,800
if you want to reverse it, give your
body some, some, some stuff to show.

1175
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:50,980
Cause I,

1176
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:55,240
I completely agree with you and I've
only been doing this for a couple months

1177
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:58,970
and I, or you know what it was, you don't
know. It was one day I was, I was in,

1178
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,280
I did like a metcon was pretty strong
feeling good. Sure. And then I got done.

1179
01:17:03,281 --> 01:17:06,900
I said I need a little bit more. So I
was like, I'm just going to move some,

1180
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:10,070
you know, some, some heavy get
my liftoff. And when I, when I

1181
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:14,180
went heavy I was like, man, that feels
good. Right? All loose them all warm.

1182
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:17,140
And so now I've just kind of
started doing it a little bit.

1183
01:17:17,230 --> 01:17:19,710
Yeah. And if you get
used to that, then it,

1184
01:17:19,730 --> 01:17:21,970
it'll start to be more and more benefit.
I used to,

1185
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:24,450
I used to run on the treadmill.
I used to do like three and a half miles,

1186
01:17:24,451 --> 01:17:27,520
someone's four miles and then Lyft,

1187
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,870
just because I didn't have time and I,

1188
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,560
every time I lift that I would never
feel like running the, you know,

1189
01:17:32,561 --> 01:17:35,920
the mileage afterwards. I do it on a
treadmill and sweat. So I'd be like,

1190
01:17:35,921 --> 01:17:36,631
you know what,
I'm going to get the,

1191
01:17:36,631 --> 01:17:39,610
the running out of the way that I'm
going to lift. And then I was like, Dang,

1192
01:17:39,611 --> 01:17:40,960
lifting is,
it's kind of harder,

1193
01:17:40,961 --> 01:17:43,710
but I'd way rather endure this
discomfort when I'm lifting.

1194
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:44,830
Then when I'm running on the treadmill.

1195
01:17:44,950 --> 01:17:48,220
But I did that for months and months and
months. And then one day I didn't run.

1196
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:52,900
I was like, it was weird. It was like
stiff. Yeah. So you kinda get used to it.

1197
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:57,040
But either way. I mean, my original
point is w I w I do the met now.

1198
01:17:57,041 --> 01:18:00,490
I do the math on after I left
during the metcon, after I live.

1199
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:03,310
That has been my standard for so long.
Right.

1200
01:18:03,311 --> 01:18:06,130
But you know how you'd say do
the metcon before you lift or,

1201
01:18:06,131 --> 01:18:07,750
or you're just doing the metcon that day.

1202
01:18:07,751 --> 01:18:11,960
It's easier because you're not
as tired from lifting. Yeah.

1203
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:16,420
Yeah. But, um, anyway, my, my
original point was the shroom tech.

1204
01:18:16,690 --> 01:18:18,940
So if you're doing that kind
of thing after you lift,

1205
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:21,160
when you're going into the metcon,
you're going to feel way better.

1206
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:24,470
You want to hear something cool.
So a lot of times people ask me,

1207
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:27,740
what is your workout?
Right.

1208
01:18:27,741 --> 01:18:32,330
They want to know reps sets
weights. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

1209
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:36,830
That's cool. Of course. Um, and I
haven't, I haven't put it out there for

1210
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,340
[inaudible].
I got a book.

1211
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:43,640
I'm putting together a book that's
going to have book kind of thing. Yeah.

1212
01:18:43,641 --> 01:18:46,760
She's not going to be, the ebooks
can be a real book. Hardcover. Yeah.

1213
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:50,140
I like a real legit book on,
um,

1214
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,010
which means going to
take a little more time,

1215
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:54,710
but I'd rather do it and do it right.

1216
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:59,420
But what's interesting is this is
what's so cool. So people that,

1217
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:04,040
people that listen to podcasts and
asking it hadn't been applying the basic

1218
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:07,160
principles because I have never put it,
I haven't put out,

1219
01:19:07,190 --> 01:19:11,480
I don't think I've put out a
single workout. Also, people say,

1220
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:16,250
what do you actually eat? Right? They want
to know what I had for breakfast, lunch,

1221
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:20,510
dinner, what I had for snacks, whatever.
All I say is like, Oh, you know, I mostly,

1222
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:24,500
you know, Aye. Aye. Aye. Low, very
low carbs. I eat a lot of meat.

1223
01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:28,940
I do a lot of protein. I need a lot of
fat. Okay, what do you do for workouts?

1224
01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:32,090
I get up early in the morning,
I hit it hard, you know,

1225
01:19:32,091 --> 01:19:35,540
am I doing squats and doing pull ups
and doing, did basic stuff. Right.

1226
01:19:35,541 --> 01:19:38,840
And I've put those basic
principles out there. Well,

1227
01:19:38,841 --> 01:19:43,841
there's people troopers that had been
applying these basic principles and

1228
01:19:44,841 --> 01:19:48,230
they're making incredible progress in
their lives. They're getting stronger,

1229
01:19:48,231 --> 01:19:51,320
they're getting leaner,
they're getting in better shape.

1230
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:54,350
So it's actually proven,

1231
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:57,170
cause I remember you and I talked about
this as long time ago. I said, listen,

1232
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,560
it's more about the commander's intent,
right?

1233
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:03,350
The working I was about the
commander's intent. It's not about,

1234
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:06,470
I'm going to tell you how
many reps and sets to do,

1235
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:07,920
I'm going to tell you what you want to

1236
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:10,540
make happen, right? I'm going
to tell you where you want,

1237
01:20:10,910 --> 01:20:15,910
where you want to be at the end of this
workout physically and mentally and,

1238
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:20,670
and people have been taking that.
And I mean all kinds of people,

1239
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:23,130
they have lost 28 pounds.

1240
01:20:23,131 --> 01:20:27,510
I've lost 42 pounds just from
applying the basic principles that I,

1241
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:31,500
and and so those will be consolidated in
the book so that people can follow them.

1242
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:33,780
And there'll be some other
good stuff in the book too.

1243
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:37,670
Basic philosophy of couple philosophy.
Yeah.

1244
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:43,170
Well that was kind of a tangent on, on
it, wasn't it? Well aid, rightly so.

1245
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:47,910
I think right, that he, so I think
it's, it's convenient, right? Which,

1246
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:52,350
which actually kind of brings me to my
point that consistency is probably the

1247
01:20:52,351 --> 01:20:55,370
most overlooked. That even though people
know, yeah, you gotta be consistent.

1248
01:20:55,371 --> 01:20:59,190
We got an a, but that's kind of everything
because everything else is variable.

1249
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:00,083
Like you can,

1250
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:05,190
you can see there's a billion
different work consistency.

1251
01:21:05,191 --> 01:21:06,024
Do you mean

1252
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:12,240
doing the same thing or you
just mean doing it every day?

1253
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:16,410
Getting in there and yeah, absolutely
not skipping days, weeks, you know,

1254
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:18,090
getting off the horse, you
know, that kind of stuff.

1255
01:21:18,660 --> 01:21:23,100
There's a million different workouts you
can do that will give you results and

1256
01:21:23,101 --> 01:21:25,470
there's a million different
results that you can,

1257
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:28,140
you can kind of strive for and
get him cause it just so many.

1258
01:21:28,141 --> 01:21:30,420
Same thing with diet,
like you can, you know,

1259
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:32,580
people have their rigid diet philosophy,

1260
01:21:32,581 --> 01:21:36,630
but the fact is that many
different diets work. Yeah.

1261
01:21:36,631 --> 01:21:39,780
I mean there's some basic principles.
You don't need a bunch of sugar.

1262
01:21:39,781 --> 01:21:41,880
You don't need a bunch of fast
food. You don't, you know,

1263
01:21:41,881 --> 01:21:46,881
the obvious things to avoid and you can
get results with many kinds of data and

1264
01:21:47,701 --> 01:21:52,480
I would go one step further or what
you're talking about is consistency in,

1265
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:55,890
in order to have consistency
that requires the distance.

1266
01:21:56,450 --> 01:22:00,510
It does require the discipline. So that's
the key factor. That is the key factor.

1267
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:04,370
And when people apply the discipline to
their lives, boom, right now we got you.

1268
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:08,170
Becomes consistent and that's everything.
Yep. So the books can comment in.

1269
01:22:08,171 --> 01:22:11,190
The books can talk about
that. There you go. Boom.

1270
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:15,480
How well it's going to
support the podcast. If you,

just make it your foot fit
year up. I put it in my, my,

1276
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:37,900
what's that called up at the
top of bookmarks? Bookmark.

1277
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:42,090

already the Jaguar. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1278
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:45,810
That's what I, yeah, we go crazy
with Amazon and housing units.

1279
01:22:46,590 --> 01:22:50,790
So awesome. And don't call it a little
tool. It's not a little tool. Oh,

1280
01:22:50,791 --> 01:22:53,340
that's right. It's the
trooper tool. It's a big deal.

1281
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:57,900
It's pretty little technically.
It's really, anyway,

1282
01:22:57,901 --> 01:23:01,200
the trooper tool that Brady made,
little things for that again. Yeah.

1283
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:05,610
Little small tool. Simple. Um, you
go and you can go on the and get it.

1284
01:23:05,611 --> 01:23:10,180
It's called the Jocko
podcast trooper tool. Chrome
extension. What it all it does,

1285
01:23:10,181 --> 01:23:13,720
it makes it easy to support podcasts
when you do your Amazon shopping,

1286
01:23:13,721 --> 01:23:17,620
so you don't have to remember that and it,
you know, it basically you click on it,

1287
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:20,710
do you want this tool? Click yes. Boom.
It's on your little browser. There.

our affiliate link,

1289
01:23:23,321 --> 01:23:27,140

kind of cool little icon if you, if you,

1290
01:23:27,141 --> 01:23:31,840
um, yeah, when you do it, this little
icon there, it makes it official,

1291
01:23:32,430 --> 01:23:34,980
but you can hide the icon if you don't
want it to decide if he knows what,

1292
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,970
if you don't want it, and I understand
it if you don't. Yeah. It's telcos face,

1293
01:23:39,670 --> 01:23:42,580
but you know, yeah. The trooper
tool. That's a, that's a
good one. That's good. Easy,

1294
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:43,301

1297
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:54,190

you know, I want this thing,

1298
01:23:54,191 --> 01:23:58,600
I want that duct tape. Nope. Nope.
Same Day deal. Yeah, that's true.

1299
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:03,720
So anyway, now you've got the
trooper tool. Boom. Easy, easy. Um,

also all the,

1301
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:10,000
obviously by subscribing to the podcast
if you haven't already owns a good way

1302
01:24:10,001 --> 01:24:14,170
to support. Yeah, absolutely.
And um, the Jocko store,

1303
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:19,330
that's a good one. I think if you like
shirts that say discipline equals freedom.

1304
01:24:19,331 --> 01:24:23,300
Most people do have to wear shirts at
some juncture during the day. Sure.

1305
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:25,250
You can't get into the
restaurant without attention.

1306
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:30,730
Uncle I use sometimes accepted, but
yeah, there's some shirts on there.

1307
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:34,420
If you like them, get a shirt. That's a
good way to support or a bumper sticker.

1308
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:37,780
Elections coming up.
Chocolate toilet, six days.

1309
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:44,710
Yeah. I saw a car with Jocko 2016 on
it. Did you know the purpose today?

1310
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:48,580
Is it in San Diego? Yeah, Chris
Martin, but still it's cool to see.

1311
01:24:48,581 --> 01:24:51,880
You know when you pull up you're like,
oh, that's Chris Martin's car. Anyway,

1312
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,840
it looked cool. He has a nice car too,
by the way, so it looked extra cool.

1313
01:24:55,930 --> 01:25:00,930
You know, it was like extra official.
Yeah. We got some real supporter.

1314
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:04,990
That's what it felt like.
Also,

1315
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:10,330
subscribe to the Youtube Channel
and you posted your first,

1316
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:14,560
I'm starting to put it, it's
a, it's a deleted scene.

1317
01:25:15,890 --> 01:25:19,120
Does it? Difference can be
tight on those deleted scene.

1318
01:25:19,121 --> 01:25:23,890
If you want to hear Echo Charles
talking about the keys being abduction.

1319
01:25:23,970 --> 01:25:27,040
It's my kids podcasts.
There are about alien abduction.

1320
01:25:27,041 --> 01:25:28,270
There's a lot of podcasts about it.

1321
01:25:28,271 --> 01:25:31,150
Is that a son and I have glory cause now
we're going to fit in that subcategory.

1322
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:35,470
Leadership war darkness
and alien abduction.

1323
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:41,430
Maybe that's why it's an outtake that
was more like an example underlying kind

1324
01:25:42,731 --> 01:25:46,990
of thing. It was more about my children's
book idea. Okay. We're good. We're good.

1325
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:51,040
Anyway, those are the ways.
Yep. [inaudible] dot com
slash Jocko that's a good one.

1326
01:25:51,041 --> 01:25:54,490
Like I said for the supplement,
10% off. I forgot to mention that.

1327
01:25:54,491 --> 01:25:57,340
If you don't know 10% off
the supplements. Yeah. Good.

1328
01:25:58,540 --> 01:25:59,530
I guess with that,

1329
01:25:59,531 --> 01:26:04,531
let's get down to the questions
from the troopers on the interwebs.

1330
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:10,670
Get a lot of questions lately
that I like it. I like it too.

1331
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,550
First question,
Jocko,

1332
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:18,440
if you were coaching Mcgregor for those,
don't know, that's Conor Mcgregor,

1333
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:19,333
UFC fighter,

1334
01:26:19,730 --> 01:26:24,050
what would you focus on to try
and make up the Jujitsu disparity?

1335
01:26:24,770 --> 01:26:29,210
All defense. Hmm, interesting.

1336
01:26:29,850 --> 01:26:32,240
And if you don't know what's going on,

1337
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:39,490
Conor McGregor is fighting Nate
Diaz again, two oh two UFC.

1338
01:26:40,150 --> 01:26:44,740
So a lot of times I don't like to talk
about this kind of thing because it's,

1339
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:46,720
by the time this comes out,
it'll be you.

1340
01:26:46,721 --> 01:26:50,350
By the time you're listening to this
might be over, don't care anymore.

1341
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:51,580
But there is a,

1342
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:56,740
a principal here at concept behind this
that does make sense to try and discuss

1343
01:26:56,741 --> 01:26:59,110
so people can learn and improve.

1344
01:26:59,111 --> 01:27:02,260
And something for me
to think about my game.

1345
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:06,220
So you've got this guy who's a really
good striker going against a guy who's a

1346
01:27:07,330 --> 01:27:10,780
pretty good striker himself.
Very good. Yeah, very good.

1347
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:14,800
And that's one of the things that this is,
this is the question,

1348
01:27:14,801 --> 01:27:18,280
the way it sets it up,
as if Jujitsu is the,

1349
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:21,820
is the only thing that
Nate Diaz is better at,

1350
01:27:22,810 --> 01:27:26,620
that might not necessarily be the truth.
And in fact, in their first fight,

1351
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:31,830
it was the striking of Nate Diaz that
forced Conor McGregor to shoot a sloppy

1352
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:36,850
takedown, take it to ground.
And once he got on the ground,

1353
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:41,260
the Jujitsu from Nate Diaz was just
way too much for, for Mcgregor.

1354
01:27:41,530 --> 01:27:44,230
So this question,

1355
01:27:46,650 --> 01:27:51,650
it's almost a little bit off because the
question shouldn't be that there's just

1356
01:27:51,901 --> 01:27:56,280
a Jujitsu disparity. The
question should be, you know,

1357
01:27:56,281 --> 01:28:00,870
what is, how would you make
up for the fighting disparity?
Or maybe not even that.

1358
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:03,120
It's, how would you go against,
what would you tell Connor?

1359
01:28:03,121 --> 01:28:05,430
What would you work at all this strategy?

1360
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:08,490
So let's just look at it as
an overall strategic question.

1361
01:28:08,491 --> 01:28:12,000
You've got a guy that's pretty,
that's what, what, what is he good at?

1362
01:28:12,450 --> 01:28:13,860
That's the question of
what is he going to,

1363
01:28:13,861 --> 01:28:17,610
one of the strengths of Conor
McGregor, he's fast, he's strong,

1364
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:22,200
but strong might not even come to play
because our Diaz as walking around at 200

1365
01:28:22,201 --> 01:28:24,180
pounds right now they're finding one's 70.

1366
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:26,460
So he's gonna have to cut a lot of weight.
He's going to be big and strong.

1367
01:28:26,461 --> 01:28:29,740
He's going to be a better
shape for this fight. Uh,

1368
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:33,780
Connor is pretty good with
some unorthodox stuff.

1369
01:28:33,930 --> 01:28:37,950
His striking is fast and fairly dynamic.

1370
01:28:37,951 --> 01:28:39,450
So those are the things
that he has going for him.

1371
01:28:39,570 --> 01:28:43,620
What does Nate Diaz have going for him?
His jujitsu is really good,

1372
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:48,110
really good at it,
too sick.

1373
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:53,580
His striking his, especially his
boxing, he did not a big kicker.

1374
01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:58,920
So if I was, if I was McGregor, here's
what I'd be doing. I mean, what?

1375
01:28:58,921 --> 01:29:01,770
I'd be working my wrestling, we'll
be working on under hooks, of course,

1376
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:02,881
in,

1377
01:29:02,881 --> 01:29:07,881
in getting control and getting back to
my feet when I get taken down immediately

1378
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:11,160
getting back to my feet,

1379
01:29:11,790 --> 01:29:16,790
the way I would fight if I was Conor
McGregor is I would back off with the hard

1380
01:29:18,391 --> 01:29:18,901
punches.

1381
01:29:18,901 --> 01:29:23,700
I would throw a lot of really fast light
punches and I move around a lot and

1382
01:29:23,701 --> 01:29:28,380
just try and touch and go. That's
what I do. If I was Conor Mcgregor,

1383
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:33,720
I would possibly starting in the middle
of the second round, the third round,

1384
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:37,290
five round fight, I might start
throwing some leg kicks. He doesn't,

1385
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:41,370
Nate sometimes doesn't even check leg
kicks so maybe you can start putting on

1386
01:29:41,371 --> 01:29:43,710
hurting on him if you,
if you throw enough of those.

1387
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:49,290
But in Jujitsu wise I would
teach him to disengage,

1388
01:29:50,070 --> 01:29:54,360
disengage cause you don't want to go.
You don't want to get in the Ooda loop,

1389
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,120
wouldn't he?

1390
01:29:56,310 --> 01:30:01,310
That Mcgregor does not want to get in
an ou to loop situation with with ds

1391
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:06,270
because he can't keep up with
him. He'll be, he'll be changing.

1392
01:30:07,050 --> 01:30:08,490
There'll be going to the next thing,
going to the next thing,

1393
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:11,250
go to the next thing to the next thing
and condom Burgerlands get caught behind

1394
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:14,280
and heal.
Won't be able to do it.

1395
01:30:14,281 --> 01:30:17,670
So I teach them to get now one thing that
does make Jujitsu a little bit harder

1396
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:22,120
if you're, if you and I are doing Jujitsu
and your goal, you're not trying you,

1397
01:30:22,121 --> 01:30:25,350
you actually disengage from me and
you're just like your whole goal.

1398
01:30:25,650 --> 01:30:28,140
If we were on the mat shook hands,
slapped,

1399
01:30:28,141 --> 01:30:31,290
bump and we're going to roll and all
you did try to do is stay away from me,

1400
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:32,760
it would be a really hard round for me.

1401
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:35,400
It would be harder than
if you attacked me. Yeah.

1402
01:30:35,940 --> 01:30:39,180
It's harder than if you attacked
me and when I did take you down,

1403
01:30:39,181 --> 01:30:40,370
all you did was try and get back up.

1404
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:43,950
You didn't try and close the Guardian
trying to attack me with any submissions.

1405
01:30:43,951 --> 01:30:45,510
You just tried to get back
up and get away from me.

1406
01:30:45,570 --> 01:30:47,700
That is a much harder round for me.

1407
01:30:48,270 --> 01:30:53,270
Then if you actually come at me with
your full board Jujitsu because then it's

1408
01:30:53,341 --> 01:30:55,640
Hugh Jitsu versus you did too
and I have an advantage. Yup.

1409
01:30:56,370 --> 01:31:00,930
But if it's Jujitsu of mine
versus run away from you,

1410
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:04,830
now I've got to run after you. Now
it's, it's, it's a more fair fight.

1411
01:31:06,150 --> 01:31:08,670
So that's what,
that's what Mcgregor needs to do.

1412
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:12,150
He needs to use his speed and his,

1413
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:17,550
yeah, use his speed and that, I
think that's his biggest advantage.

1414
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,230
The other thing that I,

1415
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:23,760
the other thing that I find about the
Diaz brothers that I wished that I could,

1416
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,440
I could,
I wish they,

1417
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:29,280
I wish they would not trained so much
triathlon and train more explosiveness.

1418
01:31:29,281 --> 01:31:32,250
I wish she was a little bit strong
or both Nate and nick. I mean,

1419
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:36,850
those guys are awesome and they're,
they're great fighters, but they've,

1420
01:31:36,851 --> 01:31:38,610
they really train.
They do.

1421
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:43,260
They do literally do triathlons and so
you're not getting explosive muscles.

1422
01:31:43,261 --> 01:31:46,170
Now it shows that they have great cardio,
but I'd rather just,

1423
01:31:46,171 --> 01:31:50,070
they were a little bit more explosive.
That's, that's my personal opinion.

1424
01:31:52,110 --> 01:31:55,050
Yeah, I dig it. I have no advice.

1425
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:59,830
I think Nate Diaz is so well rounded
in this. As far as this matchup goes.

1426
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:02,133
I don't know.

1427
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:06,840
Like, just like that first fight
Amea. The first fight though,

1428
01:32:06,841 --> 01:32:10,110
you watched the first round. It's
not easy. It's not a pushover.

1429
01:32:10,610 --> 01:32:12,630
It's going to be a tough fight,
man. Yeah. That's in the end.

1430
01:32:12,631 --> 01:32:15,820
That's not what I'm saying at all. I'm
saying he's making sure as far, you know,

1431
01:32:15,870 --> 01:32:19,260
you know how like you, you know, you,
you attack the weaker points, right?

1432
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:22,710
Like let's say I'm a way better striker
than one guy and his Jujitsu is way

1433
01:32:22,711 --> 01:32:24,240
better than mine. I can
stay on it, you know,

1434
01:32:24,241 --> 01:32:27,180
it's obvious that's where I'm an attack.
But in this case it's not like that.

1435
01:32:27,910 --> 01:32:32,690
So I'm not, yeah. I Dunno man. The cell
phone. Yeah. It's a tough fight for it.

1436
01:32:32,691 --> 01:32:36,540
For Connor as tough favor for
Nate to, I mean, there were some,

1437
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:42,150
yeah. Yeah. Even though the ending of
the fight was very lopsided, right.

1438
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:47,550
The, the, the first round, it was a
little closer and I think Connor fought,

1439
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:51,330
he had magic thought that
some of them even said it.

1440
01:32:51,331 --> 01:32:56,010
A post fight press conference. He said,
you know, he was the big man, right.

1441
01:32:56,090 --> 01:32:59,010
And, and I, I hit him
with everything or not.

1442
01:32:59,011 --> 01:33:02,340
And most of those would stop a smaller
man. Yup. They didn't stop him.

1443
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:05,740
And I think that's gotta be,
that's gotta be hard. Yeah.

1444
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:06,870
I think that got to them psychologically.

1445
01:33:06,871 --> 01:33:08,910
So if he's prepared for that
psychologically this time,

1446
01:33:09,330 --> 01:33:14,170
maybe he'll be able to stick with
a game plan and not shoot. Yeah.

1447
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:18,180
On him, which was ridiculous. Yeah. And
even the shoot, it wasn't just like, Hey,

1448
01:33:18,181 --> 01:33:22,800
I'm going to decide to shoot. It was
kind of like a ditch ditch effort. Yeah.

1449
01:33:22,830 --> 01:33:24,510
Kind of kind of rock too.
And now you,

1450
01:33:24,511 --> 01:33:29,220
you shoot your rock and you
have to contend with Nate
Diaz Jujitsu. So it's like,

1451
01:33:29,221 --> 01:33:32,250
it's not just, I got to continue with Nate
Diaz did you too, which is bad enough,

1452
01:33:32,251 --> 01:33:35,190
by the way, but you're rocked and
it was like a desperation thing.

1453
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:37,830
Then you've got to deal with it. Then
you get that. So it seemed like, oh,

1454
01:33:37,850 --> 01:33:39,090
was so quick,
but it was like,

1455
01:33:39,091 --> 01:33:42,300
it was just a bunch of compounding
factors and culminated in that,

1456
01:33:42,330 --> 01:33:46,470
that joke didn't work out. Looking forward
to watching that. Yeah. All right, great.

1457
01:33:46,530 --> 01:33:50,550
Next question, Jocko. Like you,
many leaders began as rebels,

1458
01:33:53,220 --> 01:33:57,350
chocolates. The Rep will tell
you about his band one day.

1459
01:33:58,450 --> 01:34:02,890
How did you learn to see the game? Yeah,
man. That Elgin told you about. Yeah, man.

1460
01:34:03,710 --> 01:34:05,220
And that you told me about too.

1461
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:11,360
How did you learn to see the game and
are rule followers at a disadvantage?

1462
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:17,330
Okay. So yeah, I was a rebellious youth

1463
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:23,400
and you know, when I got in the
seal teams, I was kind of a rebel,

1464
01:34:23,490 --> 01:34:25,110
a rebel as well.
And as a matter of fact,

1465
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:28,320
if you think about it from
a certain perspective,

1466
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:31,500
being in special operations,
especially when I came in,

1467
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:35,430
being in special operations is almost
a form of rebellion in its own right.

1468
01:34:35,610 --> 01:34:39,450
Because you're saying, look, the regular
stuff, we'll do the regular stuff. Right,

1469
01:34:39,451 --> 01:34:42,500
right. We'll do the other stuff. Yeah. So

1470
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:49,040
that was my attitude. You know, I thought
all the regular navy, Nah, I'm doing.

1471
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:53,600
Yes. You know? So that was my rebellion
and, and, and like I've explained before,

1472
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:58,220
joining the military, I grew up in,
in New England, not lot of, not a huge

1473
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:01,850
military proponent up there.
And so that was,

1474
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:03,980
it was almost rebellious
thing. It, matter of fact,

1475
01:35:03,981 --> 01:35:06,470
it was a rebellious thing for me to
join the military in the first place.

1476
01:35:06,471 --> 01:35:10,850
So these are the kinds of things that
were rebellious and yes, we were,

1477
01:35:10,970 --> 01:35:15,970
we were my buddies in the word rebel
youth with some rebellious rock and roll

1478
01:35:17,391 --> 01:35:20,420
bands back in the day.
So

1479
01:35:22,370 --> 01:35:27,320
when I got to the seal teams, we
actually were, I kind of maintained that,

1480
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:31,070
you know, like we're going to be hardcore.
We meet, maybe the word isn't rebel,

1481
01:35:31,071 --> 01:35:33,500
but we were, we were
like outsiders, you know,

1482
01:35:33,501 --> 01:35:38,210
we were like going hard and the group
of guys I was with when the guy was,

1483
01:35:38,211 --> 01:35:39,330
I went through seal training with that,

1484
01:35:39,331 --> 01:35:43,320
went to seal team one with
me back in the day. Uh,

1485
01:35:45,350 --> 01:35:50,210
you know, we, we, we were
getting after it. We were
pushing hard, we were, you know,

1486
01:35:50,211 --> 01:35:55,211
being hardcore and I actually got told
to stand down a few times for doing stuff

1487
01:35:55,461 --> 01:36:00,461
that was a little bit too hardcore
and it's a matter of fact.

1488
01:36:01,310 --> 01:36:06,200
So you get these evaluations in the, in
the navy, when I first got in the navy,

1489
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:11,570
that is old evaluation system where you
had 15 things you were getting evaluated

1490
01:36:11,571 --> 01:36:16,220
on and everybody, it, it
had been um, in inflation.

1491
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:18,560
So highest grade you could get as a 4.0.

1492
01:36:19,350 --> 01:36:22,370
So there was an inflation
of the grades at the time.

1493
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:26,510
And so everyone just put 4.0
for everything pretty much.

1494
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:30,830
And I actually, I have this, I
actually saved this evaluation of me,

1495
01:36:30,831 --> 01:36:35,690
but I got a three, eight,
3.8 in team building.

1496
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:40,520
And the guy that gave it
to me said, uh, you know,

1497
01:36:40,521 --> 01:36:43,880
you're just, you're just too
hard on people that are unsat.

1498
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:51,290
Which I actually, he was one of the guys
that I was like, you know, hard on. Yeah,

1499
01:36:51,291 --> 01:36:55,910
it was hard on him. So an UNSAT, I
used to use that word all the time,

1500
01:36:56,390 --> 01:37:01,190
sat, run, ceremony. So that
was sort of, you know, we were,

1501
01:37:01,191 --> 01:37:05,960
we were rebelling by being super
hardcore, I guess you could say. But then

1502
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:11,030
even though I was rebellious,
and again, that's a strong word.

1503
01:37:11,031 --> 01:37:15,620
I don't know if that's the word we were,
I don't know if that's the perfect word,

1504
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:19,390
but I did. I loved the seal
teams. Right. So in, in,

1505
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:21,710
in working for some of the
great guys that I worked for,

1506
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:24,500
I realize that if you
want to impact the teams,

1507
01:37:24,501 --> 01:37:26,750
which I want to do
because I did love teams,

1508
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:29,780
then you got to try and get into some
kind of leadership position. You know,

1509
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:32,990
these guys that I respected that
I worked for us a day, wait,

1510
01:37:32,991 --> 01:37:36,890
that guy controls of this platoon,
I want to do that. He's helping us,

1511
01:37:36,891 --> 01:37:37,724
he's making as good.

1512
01:37:38,090 --> 01:37:43,090
So kind of like that old quote that
the best form of revenge is success.

1513
01:37:45,291 --> 01:37:49,130
It's almost like the best
form of rebellion is success.

1514
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:54,140
And so that's what I kind of went for
it to a situation I was trying to,

1515
01:37:54,141 --> 01:37:58,170
for a situation where I could move
forward and kind of bring this, hey,

1516
01:37:58,590 --> 01:38:01,170
I got this now. This is my
platoon. Who'd, you know?

1517
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:05,220
So I guess that was a little bit of a,
there's a little bit simplified but,

1518
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:07,660
but you know,
I don't want to get,

1519
01:38:07,661 --> 01:38:10,080
I don't want to make it sound like I
was some kind of crazy revel in the seal

1520
01:38:10,081 --> 01:38:13,860
teams. I wasn't, I was, I
was into the seal teams,

1521
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:18,920
I was into doing the right
thing and I wanted to do the,

1522
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:20,540
do my best in the seal teams.

1523
01:38:20,541 --> 01:38:22,410
So I guess that's not really
being rebellious at all.

1524
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:25,260
But I did still have some
of that rebel mindset.

1525
01:38:25,261 --> 01:38:30,261
And one of the things I
think is beneficial about
having a rebel mindset is you

1526
01:38:30,631 --> 01:38:34,020
questioned things,
you question things you're not allowed to.

1527
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:37,470
I was never afraid to say no
or I don't agree with that.

1528
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:39,420
I was never afraid to be
contrarian or something.

1529
01:38:39,421 --> 01:38:44,400
I was never afraid to hold the line and
take criticism. So that goes even if,

1530
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:48,960
if you're in a group of rebels
and you go against them,

1531
01:38:48,961 --> 01:38:51,420
who's the rebel now?
Well you are.

1532
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:55,020
So when guys would be going
down a certain path, I wouldn't,

1533
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:59,100
I'd be okay holding the line against
them because I was okay with being an

1534
01:38:59,130 --> 01:39:02,430
outsider. I guess that's the word I've
been looking for. Like an outsider,

1535
01:39:02,450 --> 01:39:07,110
someone that's not quite just following
and doing what everyone else is doing.

1536
01:39:07,111 --> 01:39:09,180
I've always been okay
with being an outsider.

1537
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:13,950
So maybe it's not necessarily a rebel,
but being an outsider and like, okay,

1538
01:39:13,951 --> 01:39:16,470
those guys are doing it that
way. No, I don't agree with that.

1539
01:39:16,471 --> 01:39:21,471
And I'm okay being over here by
myself marching to my own drum,

1540
01:39:21,870 --> 01:39:22,890
for lack of a better word.

1541
01:39:22,910 --> 01:39:26,490
But it's kind of like only if you
need to be kind of thing. Right.

1542
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,610
What do you mean?
Like if everyone's doing the right thing,

1543
01:39:29,670 --> 01:39:33,960
you're going to go with that and
you're going to go hard the way you do.

1544
01:39:33,961 --> 01:39:37,890
But yeah, you're not just like this
follow the fall, right in line. You know?

1545
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:40,220
And I never,
I would say that's something.

1546
01:39:40,350 --> 01:39:45,270
And so if we categorize that as
being rebellious than yes, I kind of,

1547
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:50,130
I would more categorize it with being
comfortable with being an outsider.

1548
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:54,750
Yeah. Comfortable with my own
decision making process. So,

1549
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:57,800
and not always. I mean, there was times
where I did things that other one,

1550
01:39:57,830 --> 01:40:00,810
you know, when I was younger, you're
not. That's another thing when, um,

1551
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:06,150
you know, you hear me talk,
I'm 44 years old, right?

1552
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:09,210
I spent my whole adult
life in the seal teams.

1553
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:14,280
I didn't show up in the seal teams
with like this incredible leadership

1554
01:40:14,281 --> 01:40:17,950
capability and ready to write a book. No,
man, I learned this stuff. I'm learning,

1555
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:21,570
I'm still learning. I'm still learning
this stuff. I picked up off along the way.

1556
01:40:21,571 --> 01:40:26,100
So I don't want people to ever think that,
you know,

1557
01:40:26,250 --> 01:40:27,600
I was a superstar.

1558
01:40:30,630 --> 01:40:33,570
I'm still not, I'm just,
I have an open mind,

1559
01:40:33,571 --> 01:40:38,370
but now I can look back and I was lucky
enough to have some great jobs and some

1560
01:40:38,371 --> 01:40:41,410
great experiences that opened a lot of,
uh,

1561
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:45,120
it showed me have to,
I learned a lot. I, I,

1562
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:49,920
I had an open mind and the world
taught me a lot of stuff. And so,

1563
01:40:49,921 --> 01:40:54,040
uh, yeah, but it wasn't,
it wasn't just, hey I

1564
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:58,330
was showed up there.
But I would say this,

1565
01:40:58,510 --> 01:40:59,800
the lead people that are out there,

1566
01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:04,000
data leaders keep the revel alive.

1567
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:07,420
Keep it alive, keep them
under control. Yeah.

1568
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:12,760
And maybe you don't let the rebel
talk to other people. Right.

1569
01:41:13,390 --> 01:41:16,110
Maybe. And I've, I've had seal
buddies that do this where they're,

1570
01:41:16,111 --> 01:41:20,890
they're rebellious. There was outsider
or whatever the word we're using as I am,

1571
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:24,030
but they just can't keep it inside.
So they're verbalizing it and there.

1572
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:28,450
And what are they doing? They're making
enemies. You know, they're making their,

1573
01:41:28,460 --> 01:41:31,180
their antagonizing people.
They're doing that.

1574
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:33,310
I never did that cause
I'm playing the game.

1575
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:35,290
I'm going to win the
long term strategic goal.

1576
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:40,470
So don't let the rebel be the one that
represents you and talks and opened your

1577
01:41:41,531 --> 01:41:42,364
mouth,

1578
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:46,630
but let them whisper in
your ear and listen to,

1579
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:49,370
yeah,
I talked to him to get policy.

1580
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:52,040
I talked to my wife a
lot about the difference.

1581
01:41:53,120 --> 01:41:56,480
There's a difference between what you
think or what you feel or whatever and

1582
01:41:56,630 --> 01:42:00,590
what, how you behave. So like you
can, like if you, I don't know,

1583
01:42:00,591 --> 01:42:01,640
you get cut off

1584
01:42:02,150 --> 01:42:03,560
in traffic or something,

1585
01:42:05,710 --> 01:42:08,950
no one's going to be mad at you if you're
like mad at that or if that irritates

1586
01:42:08,951 --> 01:42:12,390
you or whatever. But if you
start flipping the guy off or or,

1587
01:42:12,391 --> 01:42:16,330
or violating traffic laws to go chase
them or do you know to start behaving

1588
01:42:16,690 --> 01:42:19,990
because he cut you behaving a
certain way then that that's wrong.

1589
01:42:19,991 --> 01:42:22,360
So there's a difference.
You can feel like all kinds of stuff,

1590
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:27,130
but once you start misbehaving,
that's when the violations come up.

1591
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:31,260
Basically what you're saying, like don't,
don't let him control your drag. Drag.

1592
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:36,040
Yeah. Your behavior, mine control. Think
we've talked about that on here before.

1593
01:42:36,070 --> 01:42:38,980
A little by control body control too.
Yeah.

1594
01:42:39,070 --> 01:42:42,670
They're just being a rebel
typically. That's like, Hey,

1595
01:42:42,671 --> 01:42:45,250
all these rules that everyone's following,
I'm going to,

1596
01:42:45,251 --> 01:42:47,500
I rebel against those rules.
But here's the thing.

1597
01:42:47,501 --> 01:42:49,390
Some of those rules are good rules.
Exactly.

1598
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:52,300
So you can't just be a rebel to
bone on bone Lincoln statement.

1599
01:42:52,570 --> 01:42:56,830
I'm a rebel and that's why, that's why
I was kind of pulling back on that word.

1600
01:42:57,200 --> 01:43:01,030
Makes me sound like I was
big rebel. I was not. I was,

1601
01:43:01,210 --> 01:43:06,010
I loved being the teams. Right.
So why would I rebel against it?

1602
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:10,360
The people I rebelled against where
the guys that were not good seals,

1603
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:13,030
we were developed against them.
Like I told you,

1604
01:43:13,031 --> 01:43:16,060
we had a mute me that was
a rebellion rebellion.

1605
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:21,130
Had a real legit mutiny when against
our commanding are our platoon commander

1606
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:25,300
and said, hey to the commanding officer
said, no, we don't want this guy anymore.

1607
01:43:25,330 --> 01:43:28,770
That's, that's a wrap. Yeah. We
rebelled. But then again, everyone,

1608
01:43:28,771 --> 01:43:32,740
I'm a platoon was with me, so we all
were about, so then it was I rebel. Yeah.

1609
01:43:32,830 --> 01:43:35,710
And does that make you a rebel?
Just cause you rebelled at one time,

1610
01:43:36,570 --> 01:43:40,300
you know? Yeah. I get it. Think we're
getting into too much semantics.

1611
01:43:40,301 --> 01:43:45,130
Aren't 108th semantics kind
of part of let's not go there.

1612
01:43:45,580 --> 01:43:48,760
All right, next question, Jacqueline.

1613
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:54,680
How do you deal with the leader who
preaches ownership but does not practice

1614
01:43:54,710 --> 01:43:57,140
ownership? Oh, drag.

1615
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:02,420
The leader who preaches ownership
but does not practice ownership.

1616
01:44:02,421 --> 01:44:04,100
You know what I do in those situations?

1617
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:09,340
I take ownership myself and I worked for
all kinds of bosses that didn't want to

1618
01:44:10,491 --> 01:44:14,690
take ownership and you know what? I
did take ownership. I took ownership.

1619
01:44:15,090 --> 01:44:18,170
You worked for a Boston doesn't
want to lead. You know what I did?

1620
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:24,260
If for in my mind,

1621
01:44:24,290 --> 01:44:29,240
if a boss doesn't step up or doesn't
take ownership, they're not a problem.

1622
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,120
They're an opportunity.
They are an opportunity.

1623
01:44:34,121 --> 01:44:36,160
It's an opportunity for me to step.
If you're not,

1624
01:44:36,161 --> 01:44:38,140
if you're my leader and you're
not giving me instruction,

1625
01:44:38,141 --> 01:44:40,600
you're not stepping up and leading,
guess what? I'm going to run with it.

1626
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:44,200
I'm going to run. I'm going to take
control. I'm going to take command.

1627
01:44:44,201 --> 01:44:47,230
I'm going to make things happen,
and you're either going to,

1628
01:44:48,250 --> 01:44:51,970
you're either going to see what I'm doing
and say, wow, he's taking ownership.

1629
01:44:51,971 --> 01:44:54,340
I need to step up.
Or

1630
01:44:56,370 --> 01:45:01,080
if he doesn't have any potential at all,
then maybe he looks at it and says,

1631
01:45:02,540 --> 01:45:03,373
mmm,

1632
01:45:04,140 --> 01:45:06,600
you know what?
Maybe I'm not fit for this.

1633
01:45:06,601 --> 01:45:07,950
Or maybe they don't
realize it's happening.

1634
01:45:07,951 --> 01:45:11,280
You'll end up taking their job from them
because other people will eventually

1635
01:45:11,281 --> 01:45:15,480
realize. Now the thing that
you have to be careful of

1636
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:20,270
is if you say, oh, he's not
leading, I'm going to lead.

1637
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:24,380
Then you let your ego starts saying I'm
the leader and then you flaunt it and

1638
01:45:24,381 --> 01:45:28,520
now you might make your boss think
that you're gunning for their job

1639
01:45:30,410 --> 01:45:34,190
and then we can have some issues because
now he might shut you down. He might,

1640
01:45:34,220 --> 01:45:36,560
you know, there's all kinds of things like
negative things that can happen there.

1641
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:38,840
So when you take ownership,

1642
01:45:38,841 --> 01:45:41,360
you've got to make sure you're putting
your ego in check and make sure that

1643
01:45:41,361 --> 01:45:43,100
you're taking ownership,
but you're still giving them the credit.

1644
01:45:43,101 --> 01:45:46,130
That's the hardest thing to do,
but it works. I'm telling you,

1645
01:45:46,131 --> 01:45:48,230
I promise you that works
if you take ownership,

1646
01:45:48,231 --> 01:45:50,360
but then you'd give him the
credit like, Hey sir, you know,

1647
01:45:50,361 --> 01:45:52,040
I just wanted to go through
this thing right here.

1648
01:45:52,041 --> 01:45:56,420
Here's what I did yesterday based on,
you know, the guidance that you gave us.

1649
01:45:56,450 --> 01:46:00,500
The guy didn't give you any guidance,
but you just make it up. Biz, make it up.

1650
01:46:01,700 --> 01:46:06,620
He's, you know, here we go and you just
do your best to make him look good.

1651
01:46:06,980 --> 01:46:09,770
Eventually you're going to win. So if
you've got someone that's not leading,

1652
01:46:09,830 --> 01:46:12,920
that's not stepping up, that's not
taking ownership, just do it yourself.

1653
01:46:13,550 --> 01:46:15,290
Do it in a tactful manner.

1654
01:46:15,830 --> 01:46:20,270
Do it in a non ego flare up manner,

1655
01:46:21,350 --> 01:46:24,910
but do it. Make it happen.
Get after it. Yeah.

1656
01:46:26,150 --> 01:46:29,060
If you keep that goal, you know how
like when you're on a team, right?

1657
01:46:29,061 --> 01:46:31,520
You have some objectives
and it's probably,

1658
01:46:31,540 --> 01:46:34,940
there's just a handful of them typically
if not just one close with and destroy

1659
01:46:34,941 --> 01:46:38,270
the enemy. Yup. Yeah. Make the sale,
you know, whatever the goal is.

1660
01:46:38,271 --> 01:46:41,180
If you keep the goal in mind,
then you as long as you'd like,

1661
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:46,070
really keep it in mind you, you can avoid
all these because if you're like, okay,

1662
01:46:46,071 --> 01:46:46,671
I'm going to step out.

1663
01:46:46,671 --> 01:46:50,070
Just like are you saying I'm going
to step up and lead and if your

1664
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:51,330
goal shifts from the,

1665
01:46:51,331 --> 01:46:55,800
the main goal that you guys all have
to now my new goal is to be the leader.

1666
01:46:55,830 --> 01:46:57,390
That's my goal,
to be the leader.

1667
01:46:57,391 --> 01:47:02,391
Then up comes the ego
because the being the leader,

1668
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:05,700
that's what you're focused on. I'm the
leader. You're the follower kind of thing.

1669
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:09,600
Keep the goal in mind. You're going
to do basically with your ownership.

1670
01:47:09,601 --> 01:47:11,760
You're going to do your
part and then some,

1671
01:47:11,761 --> 01:47:14,790
if someone's not doing certain things or
whatever, you're going to take the lead.

1672
01:47:14,791 --> 01:47:18,210
You're going to do your job
in it to achieve the goal.

1673
01:47:18,530 --> 01:47:22,100
Therefore, pulling
everybody ahead. Keep that,

1674
01:47:22,101 --> 01:47:25,850
keep that goal in mind there. Yes,
indeed. They do it for the goal,

1675
01:47:25,851 --> 01:47:29,570
not for yourself. Yeah. Good.

1676
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:31,633
Jocko,

1677
01:47:32,910 --> 01:47:37,650
something that would be very interested
in listening to you discuss is the art

1678
01:47:37,651 --> 01:47:42,550
of disarming people with words
not hand.

1679
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:44,160
Yeah,

1680
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:46,470
and good question.
How do we,

1681
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:51,090
how do we disarm people and good thing.

1682
01:47:51,091 --> 01:47:54,300
Tonight we talked about maneuver warfare
because we already know that we're not

1683
01:47:54,301 --> 01:47:56,970
going to attack the strong point.
We're going to look for the gaps.

1684
01:47:56,971 --> 01:47:59,580
We're going to look for the weaknesses.
We're going to look for the openings.

1685
01:47:59,970 --> 01:48:00,810
So what does that mean?

1686
01:48:00,811 --> 01:48:04,470
That means if we're dealing
with someone that has a big ego,

1687
01:48:04,590 --> 01:48:08,350
we're going to sidestep that. We might
even throw some compliments out there.

1688
01:48:08,351 --> 01:48:11,700
I might be saying, Echo, you're so
good at they do, and that's right here.

1689
01:48:11,970 --> 01:48:15,150
I could use some help doing that and
now we're getting around his ego.

1690
01:48:15,210 --> 01:48:18,240
Now we can start getting into his head.
If the person's over aggressive,

1691
01:48:18,241 --> 01:48:20,400
maybe you just have to be a
little bit more accepting of them.

1692
01:48:20,401 --> 01:48:25,290
Maybe if they're nervous, you've got
to just reassure him they're hostile.

1693
01:48:25,530 --> 01:48:27,840
Be just be open minded
to what they're saying.

1694
01:48:27,841 --> 01:48:32,040
So there's a lot of ways that disarm him,
like some tactical things did.

1695
01:48:32,041 --> 01:48:36,270
You could literally, like it
says, disarm people with words,

1696
01:48:36,271 --> 01:48:40,500
so what are words? Disarm people? I'll
give you a couple. That's a good idea.

1697
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:45,830
Oh, okay. Or yeah, that
actually makes good guy that,

1698
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:50,700
that's good sense right there. That makes
sense. Right? And disarmed or, Oh yeah,

1699
01:48:50,701 --> 01:48:54,840
I like that. Disarmed. Right? All
three of those little easy phrase.

1700
01:48:54,841 --> 01:48:57,420
That's a good idea. That makes
sense. You know, I liked that.

1701
01:48:57,421 --> 01:49:00,540
Those are all things that are going
to disarm somebody a little bit.

1702
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:05,190
And once you disarm them,
they're going to,

1703
01:49:05,250 --> 01:49:09,860
they're going to open up, they're
gonna open up a little bit. So, so like

1704
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:15,180
once you,
you're going to be,

1705
01:49:15,220 --> 01:49:19,210
once you get them disarmed
by just opening your mind,

1706
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:22,270
giving them a little compliment tome
that you like with winter coming with

1707
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:23,313
coming from,

1708
01:49:23,380 --> 01:49:26,630
and then you start to probe and trying
to figure out what's going on at eight

1709
01:49:26,631 --> 01:49:30,490
instead of being direct, right? We
want to use the indirect method here.

1710
01:49:30,491 --> 01:49:34,810
So you know, ask questions. Say,

1711
01:49:34,990 --> 01:49:37,060
Hey Echo, could you explain
to me what, what the,

1712
01:49:37,210 --> 01:49:38,440
what we're trying to get done here.

1713
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:43,010
That's a lot different than
what are you trying to do here?

1714
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:45,890
That's an attack almost.
What the hell were you thinking?

1715
01:49:45,891 --> 01:49:48,010
What the hell were you
thinking? Hmm. Hey, could you

1716
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:50,050
explain to me this?
Cause I'm not sure I understood it.

1717
01:49:50,051 --> 01:49:52,990
I didn't really see everything here.
Or Hey,

1718
01:49:52,991 --> 01:49:56,470
I'm having trouble understanding
this. Can you, can you help me?

1719
01:49:56,471 --> 01:50:00,850
Cause I'm not sure. I don't think I get
this. So now when I say that to you,

1720
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:05,050
you, in order to explain something, you
have to actually open up. You have to say,

1721
01:50:05,051 --> 01:50:06,250
okay, I'll find, I'll tell you,

1722
01:50:06,270 --> 01:50:09,310
well that as soon as you say that now
you're opened up right now you open up and

1723
01:50:09,311 --> 01:50:10,480
when you open yourself up,

1724
01:50:11,270 --> 01:50:15,730
will you open yourself up verbally
with an idea to explain an idea,

1725
01:50:15,731 --> 01:50:17,110
then you're opening
yourself up mentally too.

1726
01:50:17,111 --> 01:50:20,470
Cause now we're having a discussion and
that's what I'm trying to make happen.

1727
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:22,390
So it's pretty easy.

1728
01:50:23,740 --> 01:50:27,670
I shouldn't say it's pretty easy if you
think about it and you just think about

1729
01:50:28,090 --> 01:50:32,530
those simple phrases that you
can use to disarm people of,

1730
01:50:33,070 --> 01:50:35,560
hey, it's good idea. I like where you're
coming from. All the have that, that,

1731
01:50:35,561 --> 01:50:40,480
that actually, that makes good sense.
Or that is the way you disarm somebody.

1732
01:50:40,540 --> 01:50:43,870
Very simple. Yeah. And there's
little things you can do

1733
01:50:44,690 --> 01:50:47,840
even outside actually outside,
straight up,

1734
01:50:47,870 --> 01:50:52,870
outside of any specific like scenario
where you know how some people are just

1735
01:50:53,331 --> 01:50:57,560
more approachable than other people.
And then some people just aren't.

1736
01:50:58,130 --> 01:50:59,120
So what you can do,

1737
01:50:59,900 --> 01:51:04,900
and what I've noticed is people that
don't talk negatively about people and

1738
01:51:06,051 --> 01:51:09,360
don't come in just talking negative
in general, like I knew a guy or no,

1739
01:51:09,410 --> 01:51:13,490
I still know him, but I don't
see him anymore hardly. But
every time he'd come in,

1740
01:51:13,550 --> 01:51:16,460
the first thing out of his mouth
was something like, I don't know,

1741
01:51:16,461 --> 01:51:20,480
traffic was bad, it was something bad. You
know, he's just complaining about life.

1742
01:51:20,510 --> 01:51:24,170
And it was just a matter
of what particular thing
he chose to complain about.

1743
01:51:24,171 --> 01:51:28,520
But it was always a complaint. Everything.
And another thing he would do is,

1744
01:51:28,521 --> 01:51:31,220
let's say someone would say something,
oh, hey, did you see this or that,

1745
01:51:31,221 --> 01:51:34,160
or whatever. This is. This was
real cool. He'd be like, yeah, but,

1746
01:51:34,610 --> 01:51:37,250
and then say something bad and kind of
dump on it, you know? Yeah, that's true.

1747
01:51:37,251 --> 01:51:41,990
But you know, that kind of stuff. So
don't do that. So that seems kind of easy,

1748
01:51:41,991 --> 01:51:46,250
but you'd be surprised where
don't be super negative. Don't be,

1749
01:51:46,251 --> 01:51:49,370
don't be a negative person in general.
So right off the bat,

1750
01:51:49,371 --> 01:51:52,340
you'll be kind of one of those guys
that's more approachable. But here's,

1751
01:51:52,370 --> 01:51:55,880
here's the one that's harder.
I mean it's simple,

1752
01:51:55,881 --> 01:51:59,100
but it's kind of harder to do because I
think it comes kind of natural and easy.

1753
01:51:59,310 --> 01:52:02,540
We'll not easy is don't
talk bad about people.

1754
01:52:03,140 --> 01:52:07,400
And when people were talking bad about
people like to you or around you or

1755
01:52:07,401 --> 01:52:10,460
whatever, don't like jump in
and kind of accommodate them.

1756
01:52:10,910 --> 01:52:14,940
And I'm not saying reject them or even
talk bad about them talking bad about you.

1757
01:52:14,940 --> 01:52:18,380
I don't, don't do that. Just don't be
one of those people. Yeah, it's the,

1758
01:52:18,381 --> 01:52:19,214
here's the thing,
it's,

1759
01:52:20,270 --> 01:52:25,100
I'm going above and beyond
saying don't be, you know,

1760
01:52:25,101 --> 01:52:28,220
certain people, that's all they do
is gossip about people. Of course.

1761
01:52:28,221 --> 01:52:32,660
That's a no brainer. I'm saying never do
it. Try to never do it at, at any cost.

1762
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:34,550
Never do it if you can.

1763
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:39,170
Cause basically you're trying to
establish a rep of being this positive,

1764
01:52:39,230 --> 01:52:42,170
approachable person. That's
what you're trying to do. So,

1765
01:52:42,860 --> 01:52:45,620
even though people don't take
specific mental like, Oh,

1766
01:52:45,621 --> 01:52:49,670
you're talking bad about this person, you
always talk bad about people, the fee,

1767
01:52:49,671 --> 01:52:52,940
you feel it. So you ever, you ever
been around somebody who tells,

1768
01:52:53,630 --> 01:52:55,880
tells you secrets every time
they see you, like, Hey,

1769
01:52:55,881 --> 01:52:58,310
I'm not supposed to tell you this
but this. And you're like, Dang,

1770
01:52:58,311 --> 01:53:01,460
this guy's telling me you know, all this
cool secrets. I like being around them.

1771
01:53:01,461 --> 01:53:02,790
And that's typically why people told him,

1772
01:53:02,791 --> 01:53:06,230
I'm never going to tell him any secrets.
That's exactly right. So you know,

1773
01:53:06,231 --> 01:53:09,440
this guy talking about about people or
this guy's being negative or whatever,

1774
01:53:09,441 --> 01:53:10,850
when it comes to you,
why,

1775
01:53:10,851 --> 01:53:14,360
why would I want to trust in this
guy or talk to this guy about this,

1776
01:53:14,361 --> 01:53:16,400
especially if we're going to do
something together. You know,

1777
01:53:17,190 --> 01:53:18,780
we're kind of coming at it
from the other perspective,

1778
01:53:18,781 --> 01:53:20,490
not how would you disarm or someone,

1779
01:53:20,550 --> 01:53:23,340
you're just coming at it from how
to you be a person that does live,

1780
01:53:23,350 --> 01:53:24,183
you need to be disarmed.

1781
01:53:24,290 --> 01:53:27,800
Yeah. Like just, yeah, exactly.
So you're so, so just so,

1782
01:53:29,200 --> 01:53:32,890
oh I no, no, you're actually
right. So you're saying if,

1783
01:53:33,030 --> 01:53:37,740
if I know you as a guy that doesn't talk
bad and doesn't tell secrets and dozens,

1784
01:53:37,741 --> 01:53:41,020
but then I'm going to automatically be
a little bit, you're going to start off,

1785
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:46,990
so you've developed a relationship
with the person with that one.

1786
01:53:46,991 --> 01:53:48,270
Really make that your goal.

1787
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,640
Cool. Yeah. Good check.

1788
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,033
Jocko.

1789
01:53:57,070 --> 01:54:02,070
Have you worked with anyone who led
from an emotional or unbalanced place,

1790
01:54:02,470 --> 01:54:03,390
but learn to do

1791
01:54:03,450 --> 01:54:06,840
tach
and what helped them?

1792
01:54:08,570 --> 01:54:10,370
Well, when I was putting
these questions together,

1793
01:54:10,430 --> 01:54:15,430
obviously here's one where you also have
to use a little disarmed movement to

1794
01:54:15,861 --> 01:54:17,840
get someone that's getting
emotional about something.

1795
01:54:17,841 --> 01:54:22,370
You've got to get him to calm down you
so you don't reciprocate the emotion.

1796
01:54:23,330 --> 01:54:27,770
Don't coach people when they're angry or
emotional. That's not the time to say,

1797
01:54:27,771 --> 01:54:29,600
hey, you know what you need to do
right now is you need to calm down.

1798
01:54:29,890 --> 01:54:32,330
It doesn't work out.
You know that that does does work.

1799
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:37,190
Actually Lafe was telling that story
on the last podcast where he was,

1800
01:54:37,330 --> 01:54:41,180
he was losing his temper about something.
And I just stood there and said,

1801
01:54:41,210 --> 01:54:44,180
kind of smiled and said,
I didn't,

1802
01:54:44,210 --> 01:54:48,800
I didn't reciprocate the anger. I
said, hey, take it easy. You know,

1803
01:54:48,860 --> 01:54:51,650
don't worry about it. Let's just think
about it. Can you make this happen?

1804
01:54:51,651 --> 01:54:56,300
And he's like, yeah, I can. Of
course. I actually, I had a, uh,

1805
01:54:56,690 --> 01:54:59,740
one of my,
one of my senior enlisted advisors,

1806
01:54:59,750 --> 01:55:03,010
actually my first
deployment to Iraq. And, uh,

1807
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:07,940
and he and I were old school
team one guys. And uh,

1808
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:12,590
well one of my, one of my favorite
guys in the world actually,

1809
01:55:12,620 --> 01:55:17,120
but he would sometimes get a little
bit, move snow little bit, little bit.

1810
01:55:17,121 --> 01:55:20,000
And he had this tactic that
I picked up from him that I,

1811
01:55:20,001 --> 01:55:22,160
that I understood the way he,

1812
01:55:22,910 --> 01:55:27,910
the way he addressed conflict was,

1813
01:55:28,670 --> 01:55:33,440
and I broke it down for them eventually
was simplify, amplify, and repeat.

1814
01:55:33,441 --> 01:55:34,280
That's what he would do.

1815
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:37,580
And it actually worked or worked
a lot of time on most people.

1816
01:55:38,030 --> 01:55:41,590
And so like first if I said, hey, uh,

1817
01:55:43,050 --> 01:55:45,810
I'm going to need yet, I want to take
a couple more guys on this operation.

1818
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:49,140
And if he didn't think I needed more
guys for an operation, he'd say, well,

1819
01:55:49,141 --> 01:55:51,090
why don't you just take everyone in
the compound? I'll tell you what,

1820
01:55:51,240 --> 01:55:52,770
just take every person on the roster,

1821
01:55:52,771 --> 01:55:54,390
we'll give you little back if
that'll give you enough people.

1822
01:55:54,391 --> 01:55:57,330
Then we'll take everyone. I'll, I'll,
I'll start rounding everyone up right now.

1823
01:55:57,331 --> 01:55:59,550
We'll take every single
person that we have out there,

1824
01:55:59,670 --> 01:56:03,990
and I'll even grab some army guys on the
web. That was his way. And, and, and,

1825
01:56:04,020 --> 01:56:06,460
and I'd be like, no man. I know.

1826
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:10,410
What I wouldn't do is I wouldn't get
defensive. I wouldn't get fired up.

1827
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:15,510
And I would say, Hey, no, I'm
not saying I need everybody.

1828
01:56:15,630 --> 01:56:17,730
I'm just saying I want to
take a three more guys.

1829
01:56:17,731 --> 01:56:21,360
There's some spaces in the vehicles
that'll give us a little more ability to

1830
01:56:21,361 --> 01:56:24,270
contain the target in. We'd
look at that. I'd say, look,

1831
01:56:24,330 --> 01:56:28,230
take a look at the map we can.
And so then he'd keep calm down.

1832
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:31,800
And in this guy's case,
he actually wasn't like too emotional.

1833
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:36,690
He was just super passionate. And when
I actually broke down the simplify,

1834
01:56:36,720 --> 01:56:41,520
amplify and intensify,
oh no. It was simplify,

1835
01:56:41,521 --> 01:56:44,700
amplify and repeat. That's what you
do to simplify, amplify, and repeat.

1836
01:56:45,150 --> 01:56:46,220
When and then when,

1837
01:56:46,221 --> 01:56:49,020
whenever we would start getting into
discussion and he would start doing it,

1838
01:56:49,021 --> 01:56:52,560
we would start laughing because he
realized that that's exactly what he was

1839
01:56:52,561 --> 01:56:54,450
doing with simplify,
amplify, repeat. That's,

1840
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:58,990
that's what the name you put on
his little theology. Yeah. No.

1841
01:56:59,270 --> 01:57:02,710
If you said, like I said, if I said,
hey, I need a couple more guys who take,

1842
01:57:02,740 --> 01:57:05,370
we'll just take everyone then if that's
what you need, you need every single guy.

1843
01:57:05,510 --> 01:57:09,600
He would simplify what you said. He would
amplify it and make it more extreme.

1844
01:57:09,690 --> 01:57:11,820
And he would just repeat
it over and over again.

1845
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:14,580
And most people that he did it too,

1846
01:57:14,940 --> 01:57:18,750
they would feel stupid because of what he
did to him. You know, he'd say, well, no,

1847
01:57:18,751 --> 01:57:21,570
I don't need, and I'm not even
just feel stupid. And he'd say,

1848
01:57:21,571 --> 01:57:24,390
so just ridiculous and,
and he'd win.

1849
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:30,630
But, uh, we had, uh, we, we
would laugh about it, but,

1850
01:57:31,050 --> 01:57:35,280
but like I said, he wasn't
actually too emotional. Um,

1851
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:39,660
he was just fired up about stuff,
which is a positive thing,

1852
01:57:40,650 --> 01:57:44,730
but someone that is actually
too emotional. So like I
said, you gotta stay calm.

1853
01:57:45,480 --> 01:57:50,310
You don't don't coach people when
they're angry, you set a good example.

1854
01:57:50,311 --> 01:57:53,340
And then when people come down later,

1855
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:57,750
you talk to them about like gay man,

1856
01:57:58,140 --> 01:58:01,890
that wasn't cool and you got to get a
spin it right. Cause you're trying to get,

1857
01:58:02,030 --> 01:58:06,480
you're trying to, you don't want to like
literally coach. Cause if I say Echo,

1858
01:58:06,481 --> 01:58:08,580
I need to coach you on something,
then you're defensive and all that.

1859
01:58:08,910 --> 01:58:13,110
But if I say, hey man, I, oh man,

1860
01:58:13,111 --> 01:58:16,050
I rely on you because of your expertise.

1861
01:58:16,051 --> 01:58:18,600
And I think you're the only guy in the
platoon that can actually make this

1862
01:58:18,601 --> 01:58:22,110
happen. So if you're losing
your temper, man, that doesn't,

1863
01:58:22,290 --> 01:58:26,430
all of a sudden I can't count on you and
I need you cause you don't make good.

1864
01:58:26,620 --> 01:58:30,390
We, none of us make good decisions if
we're all bent out of shape on something.

1865
01:58:31,620 --> 01:58:36,570
So I got out of please can you just,
can you help me by just, hey man,

1866
01:58:36,571 --> 01:58:38,670
if you start, if you start
getting angry about something,

1867
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:42,010
just realize it's gonna Affect
your decision making and we can't

1868
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:44,260
have that man. We need to come. We
need to make the good assistance.

1869
01:58:44,261 --> 01:58:49,261
People are counting on us and that's
how I'm handling some of that gets

1870
01:58:50,740 --> 01:58:54,210
emotional about stuff.
Yeah. That what it simplify.

1871
01:58:54,220 --> 01:58:58,470
Repeat one breath, amplify.
And Republicans say,

1872
01:58:58,530 --> 01:59:02,880
all girls do this,
but some wives might be,

1873
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:05,320
like you said,
the wives with the last name Charles.

1874
01:59:08,050 --> 01:59:12,580
You know, ultimately I think if
you're, if you're in a good relation,

1875
01:59:12,610 --> 01:59:17,410
you don't really take it that seriously.
But yeah. You say like, I dunno, you know,

1876
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:20,500
hey you, you were, you said
something mean to me or whatever,

1877
01:59:20,501 --> 01:59:22,400
and they'll be little then why'd
you marry me? Then why don't,

1878
01:59:22,420 --> 01:59:27,160
why don't you just take it to the, to
that next level. If I amplify and repeat,

1879
01:59:27,230 --> 01:59:31,510
yeah. Or, or, or hey, go to this one time,
long time ago, we first got together.

1880
01:59:31,940 --> 01:59:36,640
She was, uh, she said she wanted me to
get orange juice. I went to the store,

1881
01:59:36,641 --> 01:59:38,980
it's going to store wanting me to
get orange juice for whatever reason.

1882
01:59:39,010 --> 01:59:42,590
I forgot the orange juice. I didn't choose
not to get the orange juice. I forgot.

1883
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:47,440
I just forgot. You know, you come
home, forget the orange juice.

1884
01:59:47,710 --> 01:59:52,710
She said something along the lines of
does anything I say have any importance to

1885
01:59:53,471 --> 01:59:56,110
you at all? That's, that's what that is.

1886
01:59:58,240 --> 02:00:01,390
All she needed to do is say it more than
once. And you've got the repeat as well.

1887
02:00:01,710 --> 02:00:05,740
Yeah. So I mean, I get stands
to that question. No. Yeah.

1888
02:00:05,741 --> 02:00:07,630
Most things are pretty important.
I mean,

1889
02:00:07,750 --> 02:00:11,530
maybe not the orange juice at
that moment, you know, I forgot.

1890
02:00:12,420 --> 02:00:15,130
Um, the, another tactic,
like when you talk to people,

1891
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:17,360
like they're calm him down or whatever,
like let's say something,

1892
02:00:17,380 --> 02:00:19,180
they lose their temper all the
time or something like that.

1893
02:00:19,450 --> 02:00:21,970
And you have to dress like them
losing their temper and be like, hey,

1894
02:00:22,250 --> 02:00:24,740
you know how, how you used the word
passionate, passionate. It is, is,

1895
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:28,450
it's basically like an excuse word
for someone being like, you know,

1896
02:00:28,451 --> 02:00:33,070
when people are just passionate,
I'm passionate. You can
be, it can be a euphemism.

1897
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:34,120
Well,
here's the thing,

1898
02:00:34,300 --> 02:00:37,780
being passionate and being emotional is
are two different things because you can

1899
02:00:37,781 --> 02:00:39,810
be passionate about something
and not lose your temper.

1900
02:00:39,850 --> 02:00:42,520
Not being in whether they're two
different things. So people will be like,

1901
02:00:42,521 --> 02:00:45,820
they'll put that on and so it sounds
kind of acceptable. It's simply not true.

1902
02:00:46,120 --> 02:00:49,840
But so if, if the, but you can use that
to your advantage. You can be like, Hey,

1903
02:00:49,841 --> 02:00:54,430
I know you're passionate. I dig it, man.
It's one of the things I like about you.

1904
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:58,660
And another thing that I like about
you is that you're also a thinker.

1905
02:00:59,110 --> 02:01:02,360
That's why boom. And you say
what to do. That's what you do.

1906
02:01:02,890 --> 02:01:06,520
The Ninja mind there is,

1907
02:01:06,790 --> 02:01:09,940
that's what I like about you or
what I like about you is this,

1908
02:01:09,970 --> 02:01:13,690
and then they kind of take on
that role for sure. Yeah. Yeah.

1909
02:01:16,240 --> 02:01:19,510
Very good. Very good. Next question,

1910
02:01:21,010 --> 02:01:21,843
Dakota.

1911
02:01:22,450 --> 02:01:27,430
What do you think of the saying
you get more bees with honey?

1912
02:01:27,670 --> 02:01:31,090
They actually asked Leif this too,
but he's not here.

1913
02:01:33,010 --> 02:01:37,180
You get more bees with honey.
I was,

1914
02:01:37,570 --> 02:01:40,160
I was actually heard you catch more flies

1915
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:42,690
with honey than with vinegar,
but the same idea. And it,

1916
02:01:42,870 --> 02:01:45,350
it's something I I agree with.
I mean obviously this is,

1917
02:01:45,351 --> 02:01:47,630
comes down to the r word relationships.

1918
02:01:48,170 --> 02:01:51,820
And always what I'm trying to do is
I'm trying to build the relationships.

1919
02:01:51,821 --> 02:01:56,310
So I'm going to put out the honey, you
know, I'm going to put up the hunting.

1920
02:01:56,960 --> 02:02:00,620
The carrot is,
is preferable to the stick,

1921
02:02:02,300 --> 02:02:07,010
which is another way of saying it. The
reward, the good stuff, the isn't so,

1922
02:02:07,011 --> 02:02:11,930
so yeah, totally that, that absolutely
works better. Um, now you can

1923
02:02:13,460 --> 02:02:18,460
give people too much honey and
now they get type two diabetes.

1924
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:20,540
They get lazy,

1925
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:25,670
they get out of shape and they don't
work anymore. Right? So you can't,

1926
02:02:26,330 --> 02:02:27,890
you got to do, that's, that's the,

1927
02:02:28,130 --> 02:02:31,400
that's the dichotomy that you need to
balance as leader. Not being too hard,

1928
02:02:31,401 --> 02:02:34,850
but not being too soft, not being too
aggressive, but being aggressive enough.

1929
02:02:37,010 --> 02:02:41,540
That's the dichotomy. But the, the bottom
line is you need to treat people well.

1930
02:02:42,290 --> 02:02:46,760
That's what you need to do.
You need to not spoil them,

1931
02:02:46,761 --> 02:02:50,690
but give them respect.
And build the relationships.

1932
02:02:50,750 --> 02:02:54,260
And if you make that your goal,

1933
02:02:54,380 --> 02:02:58,910
when I work with all these different
companies, you know I'm, I'm,

1934
02:02:58,911 --> 02:02:59,720
I want to say listen,

1935
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:02,780
make your goal with this person
that you're having a problem with.

1936
02:03:02,781 --> 02:03:05,720
Make your goal to build a
relationship that make that your goal.

1937
02:03:06,890 --> 02:03:09,770
When they say something negative,
say something positive.

1938
02:03:10,490 --> 02:03:13,550
When they want to blame something on you
say, yeah, you're right, it's my fault.

1939
02:03:13,580 --> 02:03:17,390
Build a relationship with the person
that's going to strengthen the team is

1940
02:03:17,391 --> 02:03:21,620
going to be thousand times infinitely
better than having an antagonistic

1941
02:03:21,621 --> 02:03:25,260
relationship with somebody.
Yup.

1942
02:03:25,850 --> 02:03:30,620
So I agree with it. And also, you
know when you're leading with vinegar,

1943
02:03:30,621 --> 02:03:34,280
when you're leading with
fear and you're leading your,

1944
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:38,300
you're beating people with a stick that
does not work out good in the long run.

1945
02:03:38,301 --> 02:03:41,090
Do you have to have
consequences sometimes. Yeah.

1946
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:46,840
But the team that is following somebody
cause they want to do their best for

1947
02:03:47,241 --> 02:03:50,960
that leader is going to beat the team
that is doing things only because they're

1948
02:03:50,961 --> 02:03:52,420
scared of the road.
Right?

1949
02:03:52,660 --> 02:03:53,411
Yeah.
They,

1950
02:03:53,411 --> 02:03:57,310
if they're trying to avoid the stick
that's going to be where they operate in

1951
02:03:57,340 --> 02:03:59,990
you, they're going to operate
enough to avoid the stigs act.

1952
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,500
Cause really that's the goal. To
avoid the stick. There's no honey.

1953
02:04:02,590 --> 02:04:04,540
You're not going to go above and beyond.
Yeah.

1954
02:04:04,541 --> 02:04:08,200
I think you said something very wise
in a office space. What does he say?

1955
02:04:08,201 --> 02:04:10,450
And he said he was in his little review,
he got hypnotized.

1956
02:04:10,540 --> 02:04:12,910
Did you watch office space?
I've watched it a million times,

1957
02:04:13,010 --> 02:04:17,350
so he gets hypnotized. Alright. So now
he tells me the truth or he doesn't care,

1958
02:04:17,380 --> 02:04:19,810
you know about things. So he's
like, he's real open and honest.

1959
02:04:19,811 --> 02:04:23,020
He goes into his little review, which is
supposed to be this kind of tense thing.

1960
02:04:23,110 --> 02:04:27,070
And they say, I'm like, what's
up? You know, some thought on,

1961
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:28,940
they asked him some stuff and he's like,
it's a cool,

1962
02:04:29,020 --> 02:04:33,100
it's a problem of motivation. Like,
you know, we're now if I get, you know,

1963
02:04:33,101 --> 02:04:35,830
all the scenes. So he's explained it to
him and then he's like, okay, if I'm,

1964
02:04:35,860 --> 02:04:38,250
if I'm scared of, you know,
whatever, this punishment

1965
02:04:38,250 --> 02:04:41,520
from my boss or whatever.
No, I'm just going to work
hard enough not to get fired.

1966
02:04:42,120 --> 02:04:45,210
But that's true. That's
absolutely true. So yeah,

1967
02:04:45,211 --> 02:04:47,580
like these kids who only get scolded,
you know,

1968
02:04:48,090 --> 02:04:51,720
they don't get like compassionate and
compliment in support and you know,

1969
02:04:51,721 --> 02:04:56,400
that only get scolded a lot of times.
I mean there's a lot more to it,

1970
02:04:56,401 --> 02:04:59,890
but a lot of times they're just going
to do the minimum and clearly you're not

1971
02:04:59,990 --> 02:05:04,760
get scolded too far. The other direction
where you get spoiled, spoiled. Yup.

1972
02:05:04,850 --> 02:05:08,070
You're too far in the other. Yep.
And the dangerous part about getting,

1973
02:05:08,071 --> 02:05:10,380
giving to like going too
far in the other direction,

1974
02:05:10,381 --> 02:05:13,360
how you put it is you don't
prepare them like they,

1975
02:05:13,530 --> 02:05:15,510
they wind up when they're on their own.

1976
02:05:15,870 --> 02:05:20,100
Like they're not prepared for the
tough part. Yeah. The, the, yeah.

1977
02:05:20,101 --> 02:05:22,800
And there's a lot of good parts in
life, man. But those tough parts,

1978
02:05:22,801 --> 02:05:25,530
they're there too. So if you're not
prepared from, you're going to get jacked,

1979
02:05:26,460 --> 02:05:29,730
for lack of a better term. That's
the correct term. Actually,

1980
02:05:31,150 --> 02:05:32,460
that last question,

1981
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:39,500
juggle great topic for me would be
staying committed to life change.

1982
02:05:40,890 --> 02:05:45,090
I start strong and fade fast
into old habits. Please help.

1983
02:05:46,430 --> 02:05:47,263
I'm going to,

1984
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:49,420
yeah,

1985
02:05:49,420 --> 02:05:53,430
I'm going to have to bring in the
little Shakespeare on this one.

1986
02:05:55,930 --> 02:06:00,930
Shakespeare between the acting of a
dreadful thing and the first motion,

1987
02:06:02,950 --> 02:06:07,950
all the interim is like a
fantasma or a hideous dream

1988
02:06:11,710 --> 02:06:13,930
and that's Brutus

1989
02:06:15,940 --> 02:06:20,940
from Julius Caesar and Brutus in
the play is plotting to kill Caesar.

1990
02:06:23,750 --> 02:06:26,510
Someone he was loyal to.

1991
02:06:28,650 --> 02:06:29,640
In Shakespeare,

1992
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:35,000
the Master of understanding human
nature captures what that feels like.

1993
02:06:39,710 --> 02:06:44,330
And here's what these lines mean
between the acting of a dreadful thing.

1994
02:06:44,660 --> 02:06:46,580
So that's the moment,

1995
02:06:47,510 --> 02:06:51,530
that moment when you're waiting to do
something that you don't want to do

1996
02:06:53,750 --> 02:06:55,430
and the first motion.

1997
02:06:55,431 --> 02:06:59,150
So that's when you actually start doing
that thing that you don't want to do

1998
02:07:01,190 --> 02:07:05,930
all the interim.
Now this is all that time,

1999
02:07:05,960 --> 02:07:10,610
all that time in that moment while
you are waiting to take action.

2000
02:07:12,350 --> 02:07:13,183
Okay.

2001
02:07:13,410 --> 02:07:17,760
Is like a fantasma or a hideous dream.

2002
02:07:19,720 --> 02:07:20,553
Yeah.

2003
02:07:20,570 --> 02:07:25,560
So that moment, that moment when
you're waiting to do something,

2004
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:30,750
it's like an apparition, a
hideous dream, a nightmare.

2005
02:07:33,430 --> 02:07:36,370
Cancel the battle,
the struggle

2006
02:07:38,430 --> 02:07:40,500
it takes place in that moment.

2007
02:07:43,460 --> 02:07:48,170
It's not knowing what to do.
That's not the battle.

2008
02:07:48,320 --> 02:07:52,280
It's not actually doing it.
That's not the battle.

2009
02:07:52,281 --> 02:07:56,960
It's the moment in between.
It's the hesitation.

2010
02:07:58,850 --> 02:08:00,710
Hesitation is the enemy

2011
02:08:03,650 --> 02:08:04,760
and in war,

2012
02:08:07,100 --> 02:08:11,360
understanding where the enemy
is allows you to defeat him

2013
02:08:13,850 --> 02:08:16,730
and this is where the enemy of action,

2014
02:08:17,510 --> 02:08:21,170
the enemy of commitment,
the enemy of change,

2015
02:08:21,290 --> 02:08:25,640
that's where the enemy lies.
It lies in the waiting

2016
02:08:30,690 --> 02:08:30,931
in.

2017
02:08:30,931 --> 02:08:35,931
All you have to do to win
is overcome that moment.

2018
02:08:36,690 --> 02:08:38,610
The waiting,
the hesitation.

2019
02:08:39,880 --> 02:08:40,470
Yeah.

2020
02:08:40,470 --> 02:08:45,210
All you have to do is go,
move,

2021
02:08:45,930 --> 02:08:50,790
take action, get out of bed,
get your feet on the ground,

2022
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:55,860
step into the gym, put down the
doughnut, pick up the kettle bell.

2023
02:08:58,850 --> 02:09:03,050
Do not hesitate. Do not wait, go forward,

2024
02:09:04,340 --> 02:09:08,060
go to war
and when

2025
02:09:12,020 --> 02:09:16,130
every single time,

2026
02:09:20,160 --> 02:09:24,390
and I think that's
all I've got for tonight.

2027
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:31,020
Thanks to everybody out there
for listening and for all the

2028
02:09:32,730 --> 02:09:36,690
awesome continued support or get getting
from everybody if you want to keep

2029
02:09:36,691 --> 02:09:40,260
supporting echo.
How'd they do that?

2030
02:09:41,640 --> 02:09:43,680
Well,
primarily

2031
02:09:45,510 --> 02:09:49,710
I would say support yourself
with supplementation
because really that's really

2032
02:09:49,711 --> 02:09:50,460
what it's about.

2033
02:09:50,460 --> 02:09:53,430
Not necessarily the supplementation
but supporting yourself as well.

2034
02:09:53,510 --> 02:09:57,530
It was kind of like when you, when you,
um, when you fly in the airplane, yeah.

2035
02:09:57,560 --> 02:09:57,811
You know,

2036
02:09:57,811 --> 02:10:01,590
you've got to put the mask over your
self first before you do you help your

2037
02:10:01,620 --> 02:10:05,370
infant. Yeah. Yeah. Cause if you're
not dope, like he, you know, you,

2038
02:10:05,371 --> 02:10:08,400
you know what I mean? So
anyway, if you need supplements,

2039
02:10:08,730 --> 02:10:13,020
go to [inaudible] dot com slash
Jocko get 10% off on it. Supplements.

2040
02:10:13,380 --> 02:10:17,640
What does that mean? That's the
best supplements. I like it.

2041
02:10:17,641 --> 02:10:21,210
And you got 10% off. Um, I could
explain why they're so good,

2042
02:10:21,211 --> 02:10:23,460
but you can go on the website,
read it. Just trust me.

2043
02:10:23,461 --> 02:10:26,850
It's the only supplements I take
in you too, right? Yes, indeed.

2044
02:10:26,910 --> 02:10:30,300
Where you take something else, cleans,
don't vitamin, something like that.

2045
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:35,990
Or you can support by clicking
through before you do Amazon shopping.

2046
02:10:35,991 --> 02:10:38,240
Click through the website
or just get the trooper to,

2047
02:10:38,241 --> 02:10:40,700
I think that'd be a lot easier.
So you go to the website,

2048
02:10:40,701 --> 02:10:44,060
get the troop tool called Jocko
podcast, trooper tool, chrome extension.

2049
02:10:44,150 --> 02:10:47,930
Click on it. Boom. Confirm. Boom. It's
on there. Anytime you shop at Amazon,

2050
02:10:47,931 --> 02:10:52,931
you support passively this podcast
and you're kind of official.

2051
02:10:53,780 --> 02:10:54,613
That's dope.

2052
02:10:54,740 --> 02:10:58,340
I don't like the word passive even though
I know it's the correct term because

2053
02:10:58,341 --> 02:11:01,610
when you are shop, that's
a, that's a really good,

2054
02:11:01,670 --> 02:11:03,470
easy way to support the podcast.

2055
02:11:03,890 --> 02:11:07,580
So I don't agree with you on the passage.

2056
02:11:08,040 --> 02:11:10,490
I like passive and
they're actively shopping,

2057
02:11:10,491 --> 02:11:14,090
actively getting after
it passively supporting.

2058
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:19,550
They actively went to the website,

2059
02:11:19,551 --> 02:11:22,520
they actively installed the
tool or they click through,

2060
02:11:22,610 --> 02:11:24,950
they're taking action and they're
making things happen. Yup.

2061
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:29,990
And if the credit and it's efficient
to give him credit and official anyway,

2062
02:11:30,020 --> 02:11:33,170
nonetheless, that's a way.
And um, that's a good way.

2063
02:11:33,530 --> 02:11:38,150
A subscribe on iTunes. Of course, if
you haven't already write a review.

2064
02:11:38,890 --> 02:11:40,430
Yeah.
To write a review.

2065
02:11:40,520 --> 02:11:43,040
Somebody wrote an awesome review
the other day that's appreciate it.

2066
02:11:43,041 --> 02:11:46,220
Cause then we know what we're doing here.
We're getting a feedback.

2067
02:11:46,640 --> 02:11:50,180
I'm reading the reviews. Yeah.
And it goes reading the reviews.

2068
02:11:51,020 --> 02:11:54,080
Subscribe to Youtube and
we're going to be more,

2069
02:11:54,081 --> 02:11:57,000
little bit more active on the youtube.
So it won't be just ideal version.

2070
02:11:57,500 --> 02:12:01,010
I'm going to get act. I'm going to do it.
Why don't you get a lot more? Actually,

2071
02:12:01,011 --> 02:12:04,820
I'm doing it. I'm active. I'm more
active. That's good. That's it right now.

2072
02:12:04,820 --> 02:12:08,990
So that's again, subscribe to
Youtube now. Lens, how about this?

2073
02:12:09,050 --> 02:12:10,130
Subscribe to Youtube.

2074
02:12:11,780 --> 02:12:15,440
If I'm putting out dumb stuff,
if a mucking it up.

2075
02:12:15,470 --> 02:12:20,180
But right now it's just, you
know, the video version of
the podcast, which is cool.

2076
02:12:20,690 --> 02:12:24,680
If you'd like podcasts, why not like to
be doing version? If you even like videos,

2077
02:12:26,090 --> 02:12:27,830
I'm going to add some stuff in there,
some whatever.

2078
02:12:27,831 --> 02:12:31,610
Some I'll take the deleted scenes, other
stuff, little mash ups or whatever.

2079
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:34,910
If they're lame,
just unsubscribe.

2080
02:12:36,680 --> 02:12:40,220
You're confident that they will
not be there. I'm confident yet,

2081
02:12:40,280 --> 02:12:44,750
but I actually thought the first
one was uh, it was pretty dark.

2082
02:12:46,530 --> 02:12:50,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you know
what's funny about those things?

2083
02:12:52,570 --> 02:12:57,570
It's a big inside joke for somebody
that's like no one is that doesn't,

2084
02:12:58,910 --> 02:13:01,170
if someone stumbles across
that video and watches it,

2085
02:13:01,190 --> 02:13:02,610
you're going to mean nothing to yeah.
To get,

2086
02:13:02,630 --> 02:13:06,700
they'll get anybody that is in the
game with us. Yeah, they're there.

2087
02:13:06,770 --> 02:13:09,290
They know what's funny.
Yeah. They call those Easter,

2088
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:12,890
like those little Easter eggs in there.
Like you know the trooper tool video.

2089
02:13:13,480 --> 02:13:15,150
There's little Easter eggs in there,
you know,

2090
02:13:15,230 --> 02:13:18,200
if you play it back and pay attention
to whatever. Yeah, I like that.

2091
02:13:18,230 --> 02:13:22,490
Just like the shirts as cautionary tales.
Sharp man.

2092
02:13:22,491 --> 02:13:27,050
Everybody saw that on your Amazon page
that you displayed? Yeah, the duck tape.

2093
02:13:28,490 --> 02:13:31,800
Actually if you look closer it's
like, well yeah, this, this stuff is,

2094
02:13:31,801 --> 02:13:33,910
he strikes in everything.
You just want to give them away.

2095
02:13:33,911 --> 02:13:37,650
That's part of the fun part of it
nonetheless. Yeah, sure. Youtube,

2096
02:13:38,430 --> 02:13:42,360
you can support that way.
And of course if you like the shirts,

2097
02:13:43,050 --> 02:13:47,490
get a shirt, got a kind of a new
one that the trooper one. It just,

2098
02:13:47,491 --> 02:13:50,640
it's just the basic brand in Jocko
podcast. If you're on youtube right now,

2099
02:13:50,970 --> 02:13:55,930
I'm wearing one right now.
Debbie one over the,

2100
02:13:55,960 --> 02:14:00,100
one of the troopers.
She took a picture of the day like wow.

2101
02:14:00,630 --> 02:14:04,770
Just amazing background.
Mountains, Snow Cap, mountains,

2102
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:08,160
trees,
trooper trooper Tisher.

2103
02:14:10,770 --> 02:14:14,080
Outstanding. That was good.
Yeah. Well they are good.

2104
02:14:14,090 --> 02:14:17,710
I didn't make it a point to get the
good ones. They're not like, you know,

2105
02:14:17,740 --> 02:14:22,500
you know, the process of creating quality
quality yet I didn't just be like,

2106
02:14:22,501 --> 02:14:27,240
hey, give me the cheapest possible
one. The ballpark giveaway.

2107
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:30,490
I didn't do that. I was to get the,
you know, I went through some lengths.

2108
02:14:30,491 --> 02:14:34,290
So they're so they're good.
Wearable. My goal is to be like,

2109
02:14:36,120 --> 02:14:39,360
if you put it on you'd be like, this
is my, regardless of what's on it,

2110
02:14:39,390 --> 02:14:41,850
this is my favorite shirt.
That's the goal.

2111
02:14:42,510 --> 02:14:45,510
And so the design is just a bonus.

2112
02:14:47,310 --> 02:14:50,820
I like to think so. Yeah, that's,
that's a great bonus. But yeah,

2113
02:14:50,850 --> 02:14:54,390
you get a shirt Jocko, store.com boom,
get us, you get a sticker too if you want.

2114
02:14:54,420 --> 02:14:59,420
There's a few options there and a coffee
mug and may or may not have some Jocko

2115
02:15:02,310 --> 02:15:05,280
White Tea,
pomegranate.

2116
02:15:06,720 --> 02:15:10,860
Maybe we haven't got a little something
coming out. You're working with the,

2117
02:15:10,890 --> 02:15:12,120
working with a company.

2118
02:15:12,121 --> 02:15:16,760
A lot of people would talk to me
about the beverage that I drink. Yeah.

2119
02:15:16,770 --> 02:15:21,030
I drink some Alpha brain,
but my most common beverage is the Palmer.

2120
02:15:21,440 --> 02:15:24,570
Yup. And that didn't find that
out on Tim Ferriss. Right.

2121
02:15:24,780 --> 02:15:28,050
He first people went crazy. Yeah. Cause
he was asking, Hey, what does that,

2122
02:15:28,051 --> 02:15:30,630
what does that, what does he drink?
Kind of seeing him when he drank it,

2123
02:15:30,631 --> 02:15:34,000
he got all fired up. Listen to them,
listen to Tim Ferriss podcast. He's at,

2124
02:15:34,670 --> 02:15:37,910
this is like an adrenaline fueled. There's
caffeine in though. And yeah, there's,

2125
02:15:37,911 --> 02:15:41,820
there's a small amount of caffeine,
well I shouldn't say small, usually.

2126
02:15:42,040 --> 02:15:44,190
Usually white tees about a
third of a cup of coffee.

2127
02:15:45,060 --> 02:15:49,110
So it's pretty mild on the caffeine
and he's like a micro dose of caffeine,

2128
02:15:49,420 --> 02:15:51,930
just may antioxidants in
there and it tastes good.

2129
02:15:55,170 --> 02:15:59,140
And so anyways, it got
approached about, hey, we are,

2130
02:15:59,430 --> 02:16:03,450
we're fans of the Jocko podcast
and guess what? We make tea, boom,

2131
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:05,010
we want to make your tea.

2132
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:09,940
So I went through some iterations trying
to find it and tune it, the little,

2133
02:16:10,570 --> 02:16:14,220
the mixture.
And now we got to listen.

2134
02:16:15,120 --> 02:16:18,560
Talk away to the Brown's. It's
going to be good. Yeah. Uh, so what,

2135
02:16:18,870 --> 02:16:22,800
we'll put it on the Jocko store,
some kind of connection to get it,

2136
02:16:23,300 --> 02:16:26,850
you know what Matt and I don't know
when that'll be out there sometime soon.

2137
02:16:27,450 --> 02:16:28,283
Yeah.

2138
02:16:28,290 --> 02:16:33,290
And you put that thing on there where
people can have get emails from us.

2139
02:16:35,560 --> 02:16:40,330
Yeah. Oh yes. I the the mailing list,
right. Put simply as a mailing list.

2140
02:16:40,331 --> 02:16:43,810
It's the, it's more for like, like
insiders if you care about like,

2141
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:47,620
I dunno, insight or stuff. So I don't,

2142
02:16:47,621 --> 02:16:50,020
you know how like there's a lot of mailing
lists or whatever you can get on and

2143
02:16:50,021 --> 02:16:52,200
they'll like send you a mass email every,

2144
02:16:52,790 --> 02:16:56,890
make it a point not to say new stuff
that's like not relevant because you

2145
02:16:56,891 --> 02:17:00,080
sometimes know sign up
for that before. Yeah. No,

2146
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:05,020
don't fill people's email box
with stuff that is just stuff.

2147
02:17:05,770 --> 02:17:10,210
It's like, it's like, hey, here's
my email. Violate my trust. No Man,

2148
02:17:10,300 --> 02:17:14,650
no, I'll send you me. Yeah, I'll, I'll,
when I, if there's something comes up.

2149
02:17:15,170 --> 02:17:18,520
Yeah. And not the kind of like,
Hey, one out of all these people,

2150
02:17:18,521 --> 02:17:21,460
one of these people might be interested
in this. Let me send it to everybody.

2151
02:17:21,461 --> 02:17:25,120
It's not that kind. No. If I think
everyone's gonna be interested,

2152
02:17:25,150 --> 02:17:29,560
I could be wrong. But if I think that
genuinely, and I'll send you some tanned.

2153
02:17:29,650 --> 02:17:30,483
Furthermore,

2154
02:17:30,970 --> 02:17:35,230
if there is a pandemic epic,

2155
02:17:35,290 --> 02:17:36,940
a disaster situation,

2156
02:17:37,480 --> 02:17:42,480
I will be sending forth instructions
for all the troopers to congregate and

2157
02:17:43,151 --> 02:17:46,570
dominate. And that's what we're going to
do. Katie event as a Zombie apocalypse.

2158
02:17:46,571 --> 02:17:48,490
See that alone right there.

2159
02:17:48,491 --> 02:17:53,491
Is there either and at some point do you
know at some point I may send out like

2160
02:17:54,610 --> 02:17:59,330
a longer thing like for
instance upcoming right?

2161
02:17:59,410 --> 02:18:02,260
We got the monster right?
Lafe and I are doing here in San Diego.

2162
02:18:02,560 --> 02:18:06,790
Got To get out some details on that
so people know when it's going down,

2163
02:18:06,820 --> 02:18:07,653
all that stuff.

2164
02:18:08,110 --> 02:18:11,650
I'm gonna send that out through there
so that people know what's happening.

2165
02:18:11,651 --> 02:18:14,590
They get connected. So that's,
that's an example. Yeah.

2166
02:18:14,860 --> 02:18:19,330
Am I going to email it 47
times? No. Hey reminder.

2167
02:18:19,390 --> 02:18:22,870
But I know if you're enlisted on the,

2168
02:18:23,620 --> 02:18:27,760
on the mail, then you're interested
in what we're saying. Yeah.

2169
02:18:27,820 --> 02:18:29,440
So I think this is what we're
putting it out there. We are.

2170
02:18:29,570 --> 02:18:33,910
We're not going to violate that.
Here's my email. Violate my trust.

2171
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:39,650
You know how they'll, cause they'll send
you stuff every like three days. Oh yeah.

2172
02:18:39,670 --> 02:18:44,050
If you let them sometimes multiple
times a day. Oh, who does that?

2173
02:18:44,350 --> 02:18:47,350
Why would you, why is that? I'm not
going to name the marketing on it. No.

2174
02:18:47,620 --> 02:18:49,030
Is that considered to be good marketing?

2175
02:18:49,031 --> 02:18:53,440
Somebody wants to be telling people to
do that. I don't know. You know what?

2176
02:18:53,441 --> 02:18:54,100
That's,
that's,

2177
02:18:54,100 --> 02:18:58,510
that's what I don't want
to do these market things.

2178
02:18:59,100 --> 02:19:03,520
Yeah. See that's the thing. If anybody
out there thinks a marketing things,

2179
02:19:03,760 --> 02:19:07,960
stop me. Do it. Well I did recently.

2180
02:19:07,961 --> 02:19:10,150
There's a difference between
advertising and marketing.

2181
02:19:10,360 --> 02:19:14,140
So marketing is everything. Like
if, if even you wearing that shirt,

2182
02:19:14,620 --> 02:19:18,130
that's technical marketing
for Victor Advertising. Okay,

2183
02:19:18,131 --> 02:19:22,900
well on the other hand busted. I don't
want to get into a big thing here bro.

2184
02:19:23,140 --> 02:19:27,560
I was talking to him then we market
and we advertise for no, we mark it.

2185
02:19:27,620 --> 02:19:32,160
We don't ever advertise.
We don't know. Okay.

2186
02:19:32,170 --> 02:19:37,070
And what about when I say, what about
when you say hey on it has good stuff.

2187
02:19:37,130 --> 02:19:41,880
And I say, yeah, get the Krill oil that's
on it. Advertising technically. Okay,

2188
02:19:41,920 --> 02:19:44,180
I'm, I'm, we're in the advertising. Well,

2189
02:19:44,181 --> 02:19:49,130
what I don't want to do is beat people
down with, you know, buy this, buy that.

2190
02:19:49,160 --> 02:19:54,160
I don't want to do that on it is actually
supporting the podcast and I support

2191
02:19:54,441 --> 02:19:55,250
on it.

2192
02:19:55,250 --> 02:20:00,250
That's Joe Rogan's company and Joe
Rogan is a great guy who helped us out,

2193
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:05,240
who walked by the way, we're sitting here
because of Joe Rogan, Fyi. All right,

2194
02:20:05,750 --> 02:20:07,800
the other way, I also, you got the, um,

2195
02:20:08,330 --> 02:20:12,290
you can buy a little book called extreme
ownership written by myself and my

2196
02:20:12,291 --> 02:20:15,830
brother Leif Babin who was on
the last podcast podcast 34,

2197
02:20:15,831 --> 02:20:19,940
he was also on podcast
11 and we wrote a book.

2198
02:20:20,480 --> 02:20:24,140
It's about leadership, it's about war,
it's about business, it's about life.

2199
02:20:24,530 --> 02:20:27,320
And it's available in hardcover
and digital audio format.

2200
02:20:27,560 --> 02:20:32,240
Both Lafe and I reread the sections
that we wrote. So that's cool.

2201
02:20:32,930 --> 02:20:37,550
And you know, what's cool is get it for
yourself, which is cool. It'll help you.

2202
02:20:37,640 --> 02:20:41,300
But then he'll per team grabbed
him a copy and you're helping us,

2203
02:20:41,330 --> 02:20:44,900
you know a little bit. Yeah, it's for
support. Go think good about that book.

2204
02:20:44,930 --> 02:20:48,800
I said this before,
but it's worth saying again is that,

2205
02:20:48,801 --> 02:20:51,290
you know how like some books it's like,
okay,

2206
02:20:51,291 --> 02:20:55,610
I'm going to improve in in whatever.
I'm going to read this book.

2207
02:20:55,611 --> 02:20:57,740
It's just helped me in this
way or that way or whatever.

2208
02:20:58,010 --> 02:21:00,650
But this is like the kind of stuff
where you can literally turn on that.

2209
02:21:00,680 --> 02:21:03,320
Like right when you read a certain
sentence and it's giving you whatever,

2210
02:21:03,321 --> 02:21:06,590
you know, whatever this
advice is, whichever one it
is, but extreme ownership,

2211
02:21:06,591 --> 02:21:09,050
we'll say you can turn it
on right then in there,

2212
02:21:09,140 --> 02:21:11,420
like right then and there you can walk
with you and you have to read the whole

2213
02:21:11,421 --> 02:21:15,950
book technically and it'll,
you'll already be changed.

2214
02:21:16,220 --> 02:21:17,540
That's awesome.
You just got to do it.

2215
02:21:17,870 --> 02:21:20,810
I'm saying like not all books are
like that. It's like, oh yeah,

2216
02:21:20,811 --> 02:21:23,810
it's this gradual process that
is awesome. But anyway, that's,

2217
02:21:23,811 --> 02:21:28,130
that's a big takeaway I got from it.
Now as always,

2218
02:21:28,250 --> 02:21:31,220
if you want to let us know
what's going on in your world,

2219
02:21:31,400 --> 02:21:34,250
you want to continue this little
talk that we're having amongst us.

2220
02:21:35,270 --> 02:21:39,320
We're all up in the inner
webs, Twitter, Facebook,

2221
02:21:39,890 --> 02:21:44,870
and Instagram. Echo is at Echo,
Charles and I am at jockowillink.

2222
02:21:44,871 --> 02:21:49,040
Now, one of the things that I've made
a note here to talk about little bit.

2223
02:21:49,550 --> 02:21:53,930
Got To, got to come clean
here, got to address something.

2224
02:21:54,300 --> 02:21:58,830
Uh,
went on a little trip into the bush,

2225
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:02,430
was out of contact before
I left on the trip.

2226
02:22:05,740 --> 02:22:06,573
Aye

2227
02:22:07,880 --> 02:22:11,180
Stopped. I didn't stop, but
I could no longer keep up,

2228
02:22:12,200 --> 02:22:15,260
could no longer keep up with responding.

2229
02:22:15,261 --> 02:22:19,880
There was a time they're all up until
a week ago,

2230
02:22:20,330 --> 02:22:22,550
maybe,
maybe a week and a half ago.

2231
02:22:23,120 --> 02:22:26,400
I committed and responded to every single

2232
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:29,460
person that hit me on
Twitter a hundred percent.

2233
02:22:30,750 --> 02:22:35,750
And I kept trying to maintain and I told
everyone I'm gonna maintain and I'd,

2234
02:22:36,960 --> 02:22:39,930
and I maintained for a long time
for what, six months, seven months,

2235
02:22:39,931 --> 02:22:44,070
something like that. But I,
I cannot maintain anymore.

2236
02:22:44,520 --> 02:22:47,440
I cannot respond to every single person.
Um,

2237
02:22:48,050 --> 02:22:52,980
and especially coming back from
being in the field for, you know,

2238
02:22:53,010 --> 02:22:57,570
seven days where I didn't have
it or have it very sparingly.

2239
02:22:58,140 --> 02:23:02,070
I'm getting thousands of tweets a day,
which is awesome. And you know what?

2240
02:23:02,130 --> 02:23:05,220
I do read them all.
I absolutely read them all,

2241
02:23:05,820 --> 02:23:08,850
but to respond to every single one
of them, I don't, I don't have time.

2242
02:23:08,940 --> 02:23:12,720
Starting about a week and a half ago,
I just said, Nah, I can't do this.

2243
02:23:12,900 --> 02:23:16,560
Because first of all we went
to the whole thing of like, oh,

2244
02:23:16,561 --> 02:23:19,380
we're going to go two times a week
for the podcast. The one time,

2245
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:22,170
two times a month for the podcast,
maybe one every two weeks.

2246
02:23:23,340 --> 02:23:25,410
Most people didn't like that.
I didn't like that.

2247
02:23:25,470 --> 02:23:28,990
I want to come in here and
get it on. So, but well and,

2248
02:23:29,010 --> 02:23:33,150
and I used to be able to respond to
the Twitter in like 45 minutes a day,

2249
02:23:33,180 --> 02:23:36,390
which I find that time I'll make
that time. Then it was an hour,

2250
02:23:36,450 --> 02:23:40,590
then it was an hour and 10 minutes and
all of a sudden it became two hours a day.

2251
02:23:40,890 --> 02:23:42,810
And then if think about this,

2252
02:23:42,930 --> 02:23:47,400
if I missed a day for whatever reason
or missed a day and a half, five hours.

2253
02:23:47,670 --> 02:23:52,670
Finally one Sunday I sat down and I did
Twitter for a stupid amount of time,

2254
02:23:55,620 --> 02:24:00,540
you know, six something hours and
Twitter's a great method of communication,

2255
02:24:01,740 --> 02:24:04,350
but
I got to

2256
02:24:04,470 --> 02:24:08,220
be more selective and disciplined
about my time management.

2257
02:24:09,150 --> 02:24:11,820
I don't want to carry
this on even further, but

2258
02:24:13,430 --> 02:24:16,590
the reason I'm kind of like
kind of laughing is that,

2259
02:24:17,190 --> 02:24:20,400
cause you're kind of new
to social media kind of.

2260
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:25,620
But it's funny cause like you're saying,
this is going to sound strange,

2261
02:24:25,890 --> 02:24:30,890
but you're that nice of a person that
you're like telling everyone like we know,

2262
02:24:32,790 --> 02:24:36,300
we know you can respond to, but you're
like really bothered by it. You're like,

2263
02:24:36,301 --> 02:24:39,840
God I can't, I'm not a prude. I being
rude. That's what's fun. I feel bad.

2264
02:24:40,070 --> 02:24:42,330
It's funny because from
your perspective it's like,

2265
02:24:42,480 --> 02:24:46,050
it's like someone's talking to you for
real and you're just like basically

2266
02:24:46,051 --> 02:24:48,790
putting your finger up saying I don't,
you know, I don't have time for you,

2267
02:24:49,080 --> 02:24:53,340
you know, but anything in your arm,
we are kind of a group, a team,

2268
02:24:54,360 --> 02:24:55,430
which makes it even more,

2269
02:24:55,920 --> 02:24:59,530
which I'm sort of like the guy that
facilitates the communication between us

2270
02:24:59,531 --> 02:25:03,410
from an almost a leadership position.
And so for now, and you know,

2271
02:25:03,411 --> 02:25:05,340
it was funny because uh,
one of,

2272
02:25:05,460 --> 02:25:09,240
one of the troopers guy named Brandon
who's been in the game since day one,

2273
02:25:09,241 --> 02:25:11,790
I forget how he found,
I think,

2274
02:25:12,120 --> 02:25:14,610
I think he listened to Tim Ferriss bark
and he immediately like followed me on

2275
02:25:14,611 --> 02:25:18,640
Twitter and we were going back
and forth on a bunch of stuff and,

2276
02:25:18,641 --> 02:25:23,100
and finally we were emailing about some
stuff we were emailing about. Uh, he,

2277
02:25:23,350 --> 02:25:24,100
he was trying

2278
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:29,100
to get Timex to sponsor the
podcast or me or something.

2279
02:25:30,011 --> 02:25:33,010
Cause Timex is selling watches factually,

2280
02:25:33,550 --> 02:25:38,210
factually the, a lot of people
have bought Timex ironman watches,

2281
02:25:38,450 --> 02:25:42,370
watches from your thing, just from
phone, from wanting to get in the game.

2282
02:25:42,371 --> 02:25:45,670
You know, like, oh yeah, that's cool
man, let's do it. It's good. You know.

2283
02:25:45,671 --> 02:25:48,730
And so a lot of people have
factually bought those watches.

2284
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,850
And so Brandon trooper was
like, Hey, you know what,

2285
02:25:51,880 --> 02:25:54,850
I'm going to contact these guys.
So we went back on a bunch of emails.

2286
02:25:55,240 --> 02:26:00,240
I have pictures of me with this watch
on with his Timex watch it you see on my

2287
02:26:01,871 --> 02:26:06,220
Twitter feed, not the exact
same watch but the same model,

2288
02:26:06,340 --> 02:26:10,540
watch the same model.
And I have I think five of them right now.

2289
02:26:10,690 --> 02:26:14,950
And actually some troopers
sent me other older,

2290
02:26:15,160 --> 02:26:17,140
cause you can't buy them anymore.
So I have,

2291
02:26:17,230 --> 02:26:21,090
I have enough of these watches to last
me for the rest of my life. You know,

2292
02:26:21,130 --> 02:26:23,210
I think it's about five or six and,

2293
02:26:23,570 --> 02:26:28,090
and I've actually done surgery on these
watches over the years. Like yeah,

2294
02:26:28,091 --> 02:26:29,770
like one would break a certain part.

2295
02:26:29,771 --> 02:26:31,870
So I'd taken other one apart and
I put the insides and you know,

2296
02:26:31,871 --> 02:26:36,460
so one day I was reading an email from
Brandon cause we emailed back and forth

2297
02:26:36,461 --> 02:26:39,190
on this a couple of times. And then the
other day he emailed me, just said, hey,

2298
02:26:39,191 --> 02:26:42,250
just so you know, I haven't given
up, I'm still on time accident.

2299
02:26:42,280 --> 02:26:46,780
I sent him an email and I was
reading it on the way here to record.

2300
02:26:47,890 --> 02:26:52,600
And uh, and I was, I was looking
through the email when I parked,

2301
02:26:53,050 --> 02:26:56,410
I suppose his phone number at the
bottom and I just hit, you know,

2302
02:26:56,411 --> 02:27:00,820
it's the iPhone. I hit it, I hit
the thing and it called. And uh,

2303
02:27:00,970 --> 02:27:04,270
and I said, and he's like, hey, this is
Brandon. And I said, hey, what's up man?

2304
02:27:04,271 --> 02:27:07,000
It's Jocko. And he's like, really?
I go, yeah man, what's going on?

2305
02:27:07,480 --> 02:27:09,700
I just wanted to touch base. And
he's, uh, and, and so I said,

2306
02:27:09,910 --> 02:27:13,510
so we started talking and this
was right as the social media,

2307
02:27:14,140 --> 02:27:17,530
I was reaching the kind of the
end of the line of social media.

2308
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:23,520
And as I'm sort of thinking about how
I'm going to manage and how I'm going to,

2309
02:27:24,370 --> 02:27:28,010
like, if I could tell people like,
listen, I'm sorry, I just can't, I can't,

2310
02:27:28,050 --> 02:27:29,860
I physically can't do it.

2311
02:27:31,690 --> 02:27:34,690
And one of the things he says to
me while we're talking, he goes,

2312
02:27:34,691 --> 02:27:37,550
you know what's so awesome is that you
respond to everybody. And I was like,

2313
02:27:39,230 --> 02:27:43,510
so I s I stuck with it. I
said, okay, you know what? I'm
behind him. And he sit down.

2314
02:27:43,511 --> 02:27:47,110
And I think that's when I
did like a Sunday where I
just sat there like an idiot.

2315
02:27:48,050 --> 02:27:51,950
I know, but it just boom, boom,
boom, boom and fingers to zoom.

2316
02:27:51,960 --> 02:27:54,220
A lot of people are telling me good
stuff and I'm not going to say, hey man,

2317
02:27:54,221 --> 02:27:56,560
thanks. That's a good point. Oh, that's
a good book. I'm gonna check that out.

2318
02:27:57,130 --> 02:27:59,500
So when he told me that, I
said, okay, to hold the line,

2319
02:27:59,501 --> 02:28:01,030
I got to hold the line and then,

2320
02:28:01,060 --> 02:28:04,750
and then I realized if I'm gonna hold
the line on that I'm going to let go of

2321
02:28:04,751 --> 02:28:07,030
more important things.
One of them being the podcast,

2322
02:28:07,660 --> 02:28:10,450
one of them be in the podcast and
not putting forth quality podcasts,

2323
02:28:10,451 --> 02:28:15,010
which to me is the most important thing
that, that I'm doing right now is,

2324
02:28:15,060 --> 02:28:18,820
is getting the podcast quality
from a podcast perspective. Right.

2325
02:28:19,780 --> 02:28:23,810
Um, so yeah, there's my, there's
my social media adventure.

2326
02:28:24,170 --> 02:28:25,010
No.
Yeah.

2327
02:28:25,011 --> 02:28:29,480
But it's funny to think of it from
your perspective because I would argue,

2328
02:28:29,510 --> 02:28:34,510
I would guess that from everyone else's
respective, it's like, yeah, no kidding.

2329
02:28:34,540 --> 02:28:39,280
Kidding. Yeah. Yeah. You're speaking, but
Nah, man. Good on you. Really give them,

2330
02:28:39,330 --> 02:28:41,450
yeah, I think that's, that's cool. Wow.

2331
02:28:41,800 --> 02:28:46,430
I apologize everybody. But uh, and I'm,
I'm telling him still like reading them,

2332
02:28:47,630 --> 02:28:52,220
but it's, I can't respond to
every guy. You're the man.

2333
02:28:52,760 --> 02:28:57,410
But what I'm going to try and do is since
I don't have to be sweating the more

2334
02:28:57,411 --> 02:28:58,460
responses,
if I tweet,

2335
02:28:58,640 --> 02:29:02,570
I'm going to try and like be a little
bit more active as things happen. Cool.

2336
02:29:02,571 --> 02:29:05,900
Things happen, whatever. We'll
see how that works out. Uh,

2337
02:29:06,980 --> 02:29:07,813
all right,

2338
02:29:09,590 --> 02:29:11,090
to close it out.
Thanks

2339
02:29:12,710 --> 02:29:17,360
always and once again to the uniform
folks out there, the firefighters,

2340
02:29:17,361 --> 02:29:21,320
police and law enforcement and
of course the military members,

2341
02:29:21,620 --> 02:29:25,010
thanks to you all for holding the line

2342
02:29:26,600 --> 02:29:31,550
and to the other troopers that
are out there that are listening,

2343
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:37,300
who have opened your
ears and open your mind.

2344
02:29:39,310 --> 02:29:40,143
You,

2345
02:29:41,990 --> 02:29:45,290
you who are looking at yourself every day

2346
02:29:45,310 --> 02:29:47,770
day like we do,

2347
02:29:49,030 --> 02:29:51,640
thinking,
how can I be better?

2348
02:29:54,820 --> 02:29:55,750
Thanks for doing that.

2349
02:29:57,220 --> 02:30:01,270
Thanks for making that
daily self assessment.

2350
02:30:03,590 --> 02:30:07,370
Thanks for moving forward.
Without hesitation

2351
02:30:09,780 --> 02:30:11,010
in most important.

2352
02:30:13,530 --> 02:30:15,030
Thanks for getting after it.

2353
02:30:17,910 --> 02:30:20,250
So until next time,

2354
02:30:20,970 --> 02:30:23,160
this is echo and Jocko

2355
02:30:24,420 --> 02:30:24,870
out.
