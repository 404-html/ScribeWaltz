1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:00,510
Yeah,

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,510
this is Jocko podcast number
34 with Echo Charles and me,

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,260
Jocko Willink. Good
evening. Echo did evening

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,120
and tonight we have a guest on the
podcast back for a second time.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,810
My brother Leif Babin.
Good evening. Good evening.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,560
Good to be back with you and if
you don't know who Leif Babin is,

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,990
real easy thing to do is go back to Jocko
podcast number 11 and listen to that.

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,810
I give him a long introduction
and tell you about who he is.

9
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,510
Guy That I served in
the seal teams with and

10
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,690
like I said,
go back to 11

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,530
I think he gets rid of book.
Yeah,

12
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,660
we wrote a little book
called extreme ownership.

13
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,100
I'm sure we'll talk about that tonight.

14
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:52,740
Life was one of the platoon commanders
that that worked for me in the battle of

15
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:57,741
Ramadi when we deployed in 2006
and just one of my brothers.

16
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,430
So thanks for coming on the
podcast to get extra. Grab me.

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,920
What do you say to a man
that by his own admission

18
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,920
has no soul?
Why would you say anything?

19
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,440
I've thought about it a good deal,

20
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,640
but he wasn't nothing compared
to what was coming down the pike.

21
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,543
Okay.

22
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,700
They say the eyes are
the windows to the soul.

23
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,500
I don't know what that,

24
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:45,501
Mies was windows too and I
guess I'd as soon not know,

25
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,880
but there is another view of the world
out there and all the rise to see it and

26
00:01:54,191 --> 00:01:55,450
that's where this is going.

27
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,100
Yeah.

28
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,791
It is done.

29
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:02,791
Brought me to a place in my life I
would not have thought out of come to.

30
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,543
Yeah.

31
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,940
Somewhere out there.
Easy,

32
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:11,000
true and living prophet of destruction

33
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,420
and I don't want to confront him.

34
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,460
I know he's real.

35
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,930
Yeah.

36
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,970
I've seen his work.

37
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,050
I walked in front of those eyes once.

38
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,960
I won't do it again.

39
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,640
I won't push my chips forward and
stand up and go out to meet him.

40
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,160
It ain't just being older.
I wish that it was,

41
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,090
I can't say that it's even
what you are willing to do.

42
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,540
Yeah,

43
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,950
because I always knew that you had to
be willing to die to even do this job.

44
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,240
That was always true.

45
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,440
Not to sound glorious at about or nothing,
but do.

46
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,790
And if you ain't, they'll know
it. They'll see it in a heartbeat.

47
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,690
I think it is more like water
you are willing to become

48
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:18,910
and I think a man would have
to put his soul at hazard

49
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,130
and I won't do that.

50
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,093
Okay.

51
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,370
I think now that may be, I never would.

52
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,090
Now that's the opening from the book.

53
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,540
No country for old men,
which is written by Cormac Mccarthy.

54
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:49,280
You also wrote my favorite
nonmilitary memoir book,

55
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:50,390
the Book Blood Meridian,

56
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:55,040
which is just an outstanding book and
no country for old men was actually made

57
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,170
into an outstanding movie as well,

58
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:02,270
which almost follows the book word
for word. It's, it's an awesome movie.

59
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,150
And in the,
in the movie and in the book there's a,

60
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,220
there's a guy and that's
who's talking to that opening,

61
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:12,490
Sheriff Ed Tom Bell and he's explaining
that he's seen evil in the world,

62
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,900
the living prophet of destruction.

63
00:04:17,901 --> 00:04:22,380
And he seen his work and walked in
front of those eyes. And ultimately,

64
00:04:22,381 --> 00:04:24,200
and that's kind of what the book is about.

65
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,650
Sheriff Bell is explaining that he
doesn't really want to face this evil.

66
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,270
He doesn't want to put his soul at hazard.

67
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,490
So ultimately he doesn't really
want to be a sheriff anymore.

68
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,170
You can't face that kind of evil.
So he leaves the Tube,

69
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,280
put up the police and he retires and
stays in his own little world and that's,

70
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,760
that's the basis of it.
And there's a way more to it than that.

71
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:55,650
Then you should definitely read the
book, have the book, which is, it's set.

72
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,740
I think it's sent in
about the 1980s early,

73
00:04:58,741 --> 00:05:03,741
early 1980s and the evil
that he's speaking of that
he's having to now deal with

74
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:08,280
as a, as a sheriff is the drug
cartels common out of Mexico,

75
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,250
the border of Texas. They've
escalated from, you know,

76
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,510
petty little drug dealers back in the
day and now it's a ruthless organized

77
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:20,130
crime.
Syndicates that murder with no mercy.

78
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,323
And

79
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,353
like I said,

80
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,920
it's just too much for sheriff
bell and he ends up walking away

81
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,650
now meanwhile in 2016

82
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,140
okay.

83
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:41,140
The evil that we deal with now is
even more pervasive and stronger and

84
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:46,940
completely without mercy,
and it's everywhere.

85
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,750
And we can try it and ignore it,

86
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,450
and we can try and act
like it doesn't happen.

87
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,070
There's some things that you

88
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,903
cannot ignore,

89
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,840
and in this case, it's something
that we cannot walk away from.

90
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,583
Okay.

91
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,060
In late July of 2016

92
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,000
okay,

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,770
Father Jacques Hamel.
