00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,100
This is Jocko podcast number
one 28 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,890
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,680
It's been a little bit
since we've done a Q and a.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,740
So we're going to roll into some Q
and a and gonna to try and answer more

5
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:19,110
questions than normal
with some shorter answers.

6
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:24,111
Got a lot of Twitter questions which
necessitates shorter questions and thereby

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,740
in some cases, shorter
answers. I've got to,

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,300
I've got some more detailed answers or
detailed questions stacked up for another

9
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:38,250
Q and a. But for today we're just going
to try and get through some of these,

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,640
um,
no guarantee on that.

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,230
But with rock and roll. Cool. Taco,
do you believe in overtraining,

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,730
keep believing overtraining, or
is that an excuse people, youth,

13
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,510
you have the CT, Fletcher's
triathletes, yourself, et Cetera,

14
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:55,830
who get after it daily.

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,920
You also find other elite athletes who
believe in rest days who are by no means

16
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:05,970
slackers. What's your take? You
know, what can you overtrain? Yes,

17
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:09,660
you can. Yeah, you can definitely
overtrain. I will say this,

18
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:14,300
most people don't overtrain cause you got
to work pretty hard to overtrain. Yeah.

19
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,760
And if you overtrain you'll know it
if you're paying attention to your

20
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:19,410
performance because your
performance will start to go down.

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,810
That that's what's happening.
And I've said this before,

22
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,400
I've seen it with fighters that were
preparing for a fight and they'd be

23
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:30,990
overtraining and you'd watch
their performance. Someone
that's normally crushing,

24
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,400
let's say the fighters normally crushing
training partner a and all of a sudden

25
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:39,150
training a partner, a starts getting
the better of the fighter and you know,

26
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,140
you know, it's, it's obvious the guy's
overtrained so take a couple of days off,

27
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,920
get some steak and get back,

28
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,270
get reset cause you're overtrained
so yeah, you can overtrain for sure.

29
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,900
Now what I don't believe in,
well it's hard to overtrain.

30
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,050
I mean these guys are working to
hard when they're overtraining,

31
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,890
but a lot of people just, they, they do.

32
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:03,750
You can use overtraining as an excuse.

33
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,880
What I do is I'm going to
do something every day.

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,920
I try and do something every
day regardless. Like even if,

35
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,730
even if I feel like I'm completely,

36
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,050
like last night I got kind of beat
up on the mat. I know I'm pretty,

37
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,580
I'm pretty overtrained right now, but
I'm also getting ready to go on a trip.

38
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:22,200
So I'm like, okay, well I just to still,

39
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,960
I squatted today and I'm still
going to train hard tonight.

40
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,150
And then I got a couple of
days where I'll be on the road.

41
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:32,210
I might take one of those days and just
like do more of a stretch mobility type

42
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,380
scenario work.

43
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:37,050
I'll still get the blood flowing cause I
got to get the blood flow. But you know,

44
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:39,720
maybe just like a hundred burpees
and then a bunch of stretching.

45
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,600
So I'll do a little recovery on the road.

46
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,920
But yes you can overtrain it's hard to
do it if your performance is going down,

47
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,570
you're overtraining, eat some steak, take
a break, take a break, eat some steak.

48
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,290
Well hundred burpees kind of a lot.
I think a hundred burpees. Yeah.

49
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,160
That's like less

50
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,400
than 10 minutes. Put it this
way. I did. Oh then again,

51
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:06,550
all the times it did a hundred burpees
with after a workout so that it feels a

52
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:11,170
little different. Yeah, you just
go do a hundred burpees. Burpees,

53
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,700
yeah. The, well, the Gilkey.

54
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,900
So overtraining though is like there's
two or maybe even more different kinds of

55
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:21,070
quote unquote overtraining. So there's
like this like a for real like, I dunno,

56
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,590
I'm going to misuse a clinical
version of overtraining,

57
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:30,610
which is like official, like your blood,
you can recognize it in your blood,

58
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:33,670
it likes certain things and sure,
whatever. And there's all these symptoms.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,350
They're not as probably it's a thing,

60
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,340
it's an actual thing like you don't sleep
and it's like your body be essentially

61
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:42,970
goes into this like negative kind of
feedback or positive feedback loop where

62
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:44,100
it's like,
but it just,

63
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,170
you're overtraining and it takes
like a while to get out of it.

64
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,540
Like a while you gotta
go through this process.

65
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,960
And then there's also like a condition
like rhabdo something that's a serious

66
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:59,440
situation that's essentially overtraining.
Yes.

67
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:03,720
That's a cute or training quickly.
Yeah,

68
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,590
usually to get hit with the rabbit and
then there's like this kind of gray area

69
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,020
and you can get Rhabdo I
guess you can get, I think,

70
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,040
I think you get robbed when like
certain muscle groups offer.

71
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,190
But anyways Rhabdo yeah, that'll take
you out. I remember cake nuts was we're,

72
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,033
we're rolling kicked.

73
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,360
He's the kind of guy who's like
just kind of down for anything. Not,

74
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:25,780
there's kind of like fireplug
type guy cause he's super mellow,

75
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:26,950
but he's just down for anything.

76
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:31,870
Like the kind where if you're going to go
do something kind of weird or whatever,

77
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,290
he'll always concerned to just be there.
You know, he always kind of says yes.

78
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,590
So anyway, we're training
and he, you know,

79
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:40,990
when someone asks you to roll and
you're done, you're like, oh, not done.

80
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:44,410
Maybe next time, you know, not
cake, nuts. He was like, okay,

81
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,810
does and you could tell he was like tired.
It's like okay.

82
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,540
And then we're all done or 80 and then
you know how certain guys come in late or

83
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:53,320
whatever. It may be one, two
guys. And another guy asked
him, number one, we're like,

84
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:56,740
Dang, cake dot still rolling. And I
think even enrolled before us too,

85
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,560
and he was just rolling and rolling.

86
00:04:58,561 --> 00:05:01,550
He might've did some other PT
or whatever and he's like, man,

87
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,460
I'm really tired right now. And then
another guy asked them, well, let's roll.

88
00:05:07,461 --> 00:05:11,550
And he's like, okay. And we're just
laughing. Like it was kind of, yeah,

89
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:16,120
tile these, which means all these
roles are not like relaxed scenarios.

90
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,760
Their actual level nine deaf battles.
He's going forward.

91
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,080
He's a perfect dog down by the way.
Oh, that's cool. Yeah. Um, but yeah,

92
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:25,990
at the time I think he was a white belt
and yeah. So he goes and you're like, man,

93
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:28,450
I'm tired. I'm messed up. And
I was like, yeah man, I dig it.

94
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:33,280
And then you rolled a lot and then come
to find out he had rhabdo. But anyway,

95
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,600
and then there's a grey area over
training where you're training a lot.

96
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:41,920
Maybe your testosterone will be down
from training a lot. And me, you know,

97
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:44,230
your nutrition may or may not
be all that kind of thing.

98
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:45,700
So your performance does go down.

99
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,430
You feel a little bit more tired
going into training, you know,

100
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,540
if you're lifting or whatever,

101
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,030
you can't lift this heavy and all this
stuff that's like a great or you're not

102
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:55,750
overtrained no, he just, how you say
just your, just steak. And a day,

103
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:58,070
two days later, boom, you're
kind of back in the game,

104
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,820
you know,
kind of thing.

105
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,080
But I don't think that's a clinical
technically overtrained maybe you're not

106
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:06,650
recovering day to day as much as
something like this, but none the less,

107
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,960
but all true things. All real things. Hey,
your bodies, this machine man. If you,

108
00:06:10,961 --> 00:06:13,460
you know, with all these different
systems that the system's ain't work,

109
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:17,450
all ain't working right, you may not get,
you know, the performance that you, uh,

110
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,000
do you want?
Next question.

111
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,950
What would you pack for lunch if
you had a typical nine to five job?

112
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:33,270
Chicken, steak, beef Jerky, the
nuts. I don't know. A salad. No.

113
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,940
Big shocker there. Yeah, just
don't eat the doughnuts in
the office. Next question.

114
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,950
Know Tuna Sandwich? No. Tuna
Sandwich. Whole wheat bread,

115
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,730
tomato, lettuce, sprouts.
That's your go to now.

116
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,760
That's what my mom would probably pack
for me if she was packing my lunch

117
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,090
for lunch. When you were
younger. That wasn't a question.

118
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,830
It kind of sounds like my mom would
have happened to me when I was young.

119
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,140
Pb and J. All right. Oh, there it
is. That's good bag of potato chips.

120
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,860
Oh that's not good. Well how's PB and
j good but, but potato chips are not,

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,260
I just manages the same. It tastes good
actually. But peanut butter is good.

122
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,600
And of course what I would do is take
the attendance was put them on the

123
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,270
like a second. All good. But yeah, so
there you go. You guys know what to eat.

124
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:25,950
Come on, knock it off. But I,

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,880
I'm sure they're asking because
that is kind of a thing.

126
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,580
Like do you have a nine to
five job? Right. And especially
if kind of the culture,

127
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:34,820
he was like, okay, I go to work and
then boom, we got, well got a lunch,

128
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:38,630
me and my boys from work, we did a
lunch, maybe a bar maybe, you know,

129
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:42,410
kind of thing. But they want to break the
cycle. So it's like, you know, it's not,

130
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:45,390
it's kinda common LG like okay, break the
cycle of bring your own lunch. You, yeah,

131
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,020
we'll definitely bring you a much,
normally you will, you eat better,

132
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:51,870
but you also won't spend $19 for lunch.
Yeah.

133
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,690
You'll spend like $6 for lunch and it'll
be better for you. So that's just, yeah.

134
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,550
Yeah. Okay. So maybe I
should've made that more clear.

135
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,200
Don't go out to the little
corner store and or whatever,

136
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,320
the corner restaurant and spend $28 for
crappy food that's going to make you fat

137
00:08:06,321 --> 00:08:10,820
and lazy. Yeah. Just pack your own food
that cost $6. That's gonna make you lean,

138
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:15,200
strong and smarter. Yeah. But, and then
their incomes, this question, I, I think,

139
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:18,650
I don't know, but I think so because
let's say you've never done that before.

140
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:24,300
Yeah. Sounds crazy. But here's the
thing. So, so Greg chain, right?

141
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:29,410
You always eat tough and I don't think
he ever like cooked at home or whatever.

142
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:33,350
Right. And me and Kinda, well, I'd kind of
do both, whatever, but I cook it at home.

143
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:36,080
I go make it, have my goto
little things right. And home.

144
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,180
So we were talking and I was
explained to him, Oh yeah, oh yeah,

145
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:43,550
I'll just do this when I'm on the
program, I'll do this, I'll make this.

146
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:45,650
And he's like, Dang you,
you actually do that.

147
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,690
And I'm like cook and make stuff at home.

148
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,740
I'll surprise like it was like
this foreign thing for it. Okay.

149
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,110
I'll give you a goto right now. You want
to talk to co two. So you said tuna.

150
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,710
I have a

151
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,210
tin chicken. Like I don't even know
what my wife calls it. Tin Chicken.

152
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,060
It comes to can cause I
don't really like fish. Sure.

153
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,110
And so I have chicken in a can open it
up, put some mandates in there. You're,

154
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,830
you're good food. I'll do that too. And
you can get big big cans of chicken.

155
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,120
Go to Costco. Total. Goto.
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good one.

156
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:20,520
Let us sodium a lot of times
in those ones, you know,

157
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,130
if you care about this kinds of things.
But yeah,

158
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:24,330
there's a lot of chicken in there too.

159
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,130
You know what he can do with that too
if you have just a little bit more time.

160
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,340
The ticket, the one in the Kansas wheat
is good cause it's so fast. Boom, boom,

161
00:09:33,341 --> 00:09:35,950
boom. One speed. But if you, uh,

162
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:40,410
you can like kinda halfway
boil some chicken, chop it up,

163
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,150
saute it, and then chop
it up even more. Boom.

164
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:49,080
Add the minis is kind of the same
deal and you can do it that way.

165
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:52,560
You don't need like the canned chicken.
Some people do not prefer canned chicken.

166
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,430
That's cool. That's the thing. I can
do other things. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

167
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,590
Then that's the other thing I'm talking
about anyway, so, well, you know,

168
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,750
if your mom made chicken,
I know,

169
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,830
you know how Greg, it was foreign
to Greg to actually cook at home.

170
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,010
It's foreign for people to actually
make a lunch. They're like, man,

171
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:15,510
where do I start with this thing? What
do I do? And then usually in fact,

172
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:19,080
from what I understand anyway,
usually it's kind of like, oh, all,

173
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,550
all kind of sort of buy a lunch
while I'm not at work. You know,

174
00:10:23,551 --> 00:10:24,191
maybe go to the store,

175
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:26,520
buy one of these box lunches or
something and then bring it in.

176
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,990
It's defeating the purpose. Yeah, it's a
thing, but it's a defeating the purpose.

177
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,000
You make the lunch like a
sandwich or something like
that. I'm telling you. Cool.

178
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,790
It works. That's the direction
you want to go. That's my opinion.

179
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,440
Next question. You've mentioned
being involved in real estate.

180
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,360
Are you still involved? How'd you get
started? Whether flipping or renting,

181
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,620
flipping,
buying,

182
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,960
fixing up and selling houses
or renting or whatever.

183
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:56,430
Did you start with a lot of money or no?

184
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,720
Is it something you are
or were very hands on with

185
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:05,860
or contract workout? I've been real lucky
with re the whole real estate thing.

186
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:06,611
Part of it's,

187
00:11:06,611 --> 00:11:11,611
cause I was in the military and
while the crash happened I did,

188
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:16,870
I didn't even barely knew there was an
economic crash going on. And so we're,

189
00:11:16,871 --> 00:11:21,871
so we're talking 2007 2008 timeframe
when the market crashed and I was in the

190
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:23,711
military,

191
00:11:23,711 --> 00:11:28,711
so I just kept doing what I was doing
and bought some houses then and I would

192
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:33,790
say yeah. And then I've continued
to do that. So it's a good,

193
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,670
it's a good investment.
Longterm, short term,

194
00:11:36,671 --> 00:11:40,300
you can get screwed if you think you're
going to buy something right now. Like,

195
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:42,790
for instance, flipping a house, that's
cool, you can make a lot of money.

196
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,320
But also you could buy right now,

197
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:47,440
buy a house for $200,000 and think
you're going to fix it up and sell it for

198
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:50,740
$300,000 and then you buy
it and the market crashes.

199
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,130
And now your house that you bought for
$200,000 is only worth hundred and 50 so

200
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:58,540
now you're, you're out of luck. So you,
the way I look at it, you know, just as,

201
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,530
as a normal person. Yeah,
just try and buy a house.

202
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:07,531
That's number one by trying my house to
live in and then try and pay it off as

203
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:08,561
fast as you can.

204
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:12,370
And then when you get it to a good point
and you fix it up and you think you can

205
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:13,720
run it out,
that's cool dude.

206
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:18,610
It rented out and buy another one and keep
doing that one thing, one, I, you know,

207
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:23,570
I'm no real estate expert. I'm
not running around, you know,

208
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,340
explain, explaining. I'm
not going to put out a,

209
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:31,210
I'm not going to put on a seminar on the
proper real estate investing, but hey,

210
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,730
if you're going to buy, buy a
house, this is, this is something,

211
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,740
a little bit of advice.
If you're going to buy a house,

212
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,650
buy a house in the place
where you want to live,

213
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,010
where you want to live in it
by the worst crappiest house,

214
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,810
but where you want it, cause the location
you cannot change. Once you buy it,

215
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,690
you're stuck in that location
and so he said if you can,

216
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,680
but you can always rebuild it and fix
it up and make it nice. So buy a house.

217
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,750
I made that mistake one
time I bought a house.

218
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,430
I bought a bigger house in a place where
I didn't really like it, but I thought,

219
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:02,530
well the house is so
nice and big and about,

220
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,150
it was like two weeks after I bought it.

221
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:05,950
This is actually the
first house I ever bought.

222
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,350
Two weeks after I bought it I was saying,
man,

223
00:13:08,351 --> 00:13:10,030
I should have bought the
other house I was looking at.

224
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,500
That was in the location I wanted.

225
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,960
Then it was a little bit smaller
and not as Nice. So anyways,

226
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:19,030
by where you want it and then fix it
up as you go along. As far as the work,

227
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:23,140
doing the work,
all the work that I did on my houses,

228
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:24,850
I did myself.
And

229
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,930
now I don't do it as much anymore
more because I don't have time.

230
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:31,750
But when I was in the navy,
well you either have time
where you have money, right?

231
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,450
So when I was in the navy,
I had more time,

232
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:37,390
if you can believe that when I was
in the navy and I had no money,

233
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,980
so like all my houses, when I
bought them, I couldn't afford them.

234
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,950
I could barely afford them.
So you gotta be,

235
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:49,951
that's now not advising that because
if you gotta be able to suck it up,

236
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,110
if things go sideways, you're going to
be living on Lee. No money live in leap.

237
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,930
It's going to be lean Christmas doesn't,
my parents used to say to me,

238
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,150
and that's what I said to my kids,
is going to be lean Christmas.

239
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,810
So you gotta be ready for the link. Some
people aren't ready for Lean Christmas.

240
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,940
Yes.
Some people cannot live,

241
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,710
some people cannot control
their expenses if things go bad.

242
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,470
And you know,
when I bought all my,

243
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,950
just about every house I bought when I
got into my house, it was like, okay,

244
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,630
we made it. Now we're going to
starve for two years or whatever.

245
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:27,630
Trying to get everything
squared away again. So anyways,
you got to be smart. Um,

246
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,440
but it definitely makes more sense to buy.

247
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,990
I shouldn't say this cause there's
some people that argue again,

248
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,650
I think if you're going to
live somewhere for a while,

249
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,070
buy a house instead of paying
someone else's mortgage,

250
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,960
pay your own and try and pay it
down as quick as you can. That's it.

251
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,530
That's my advice. Cool.
Okay. I guess I dunno,

252
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,520
I'm really less of an expert in that.
Yeah. Like, like here's an idea.

253
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,770
When you joined military as save up all
your money, don't spend it on booze,

254
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,630
which you're going to,

255
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,450
you're going to want to cause everyone's
gonna be going out. Don't do that by,

256
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:03,080
by whatever.
You can buy by the little Condo,

257
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:07,370
buy something and then rent out the
rooms that are in it and you sleep on the

258
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:09,860
couch and you rent out the rooms
and you're paying the mortgage.

259
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:12,350
As soon as you get that
thing kind of stable, boom,

260
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,580
go and buy another one and that's,
that's how you can start doing it.

261
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,750
You said that it was easier for you in
the cause you were in the military. Why?

262
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,820
Why is it easy?
Paycheck was coming no matter what.

263
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,250
He hasn't like I was going
to get laid off. I mean,

264
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:28,640
so many people got laid off during the,
during the economic downturn,

265
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,550
they couldn't buy, they couldn't afford
their mortgage payments anymore and that,

266
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,190
that was made the bad
situation even worse.

267
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,940
So for me it was like I was just sitting
there collecting my paycheck as normal.

268
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:43,160
Didn't even really realize that the
market was getting destroyed on all fronts

269
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,450
because I was in the military and I
wasn't sitting around staring at the,

270
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:51,740
at the stock market everyday trying to
figure out where it was going to go and

271
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,620
do, do you get, I mean you do, right? You
get like benefits or he'd loans easier,

272
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,510
whatever. Yeah. There's something
called the VA loan, which,

273
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:03,740
which is a good loan. It's a good
loan and you can only get one though.

274
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,970
So I mean I use that you can reset
it and you use it on other houses,

275
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:09,350
but which I've done a couple of times,

276
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,670
but that's a cool little jumping off
point or jumping off, jumping off point.

277
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,770
It's a really good jumping off point for
sure. But the thing to be careful of is,

278
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,270
is speculating and thinking that the
prices of houses is always going to go up,

279
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:27,140
which is what everyone fought in
2006 2007 2008 hey, don't worry.

280
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:29,570
The prices are just going to
keep going up. They're not.

281
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,230
They're going to come down sometimes.
Yeah. And so you can't bank on that.

282
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,860
You can't bank on that. What you bank
on is like, okay, I liked this house.

283
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,350
It's in a good location.
I'm gonna live here for a long time.

284
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,770
If I get stuck in it for a long time,
I don't Matt my mind,

285
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:46,760
I won't be mad and I can suffer.

286
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,930
Okay. I can make my family suffer. Okay.
Like, you know when you can't take your,

287
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:57,500
your family out for dinner for
months on end like, oh no, sorry,

288
00:16:57,501 --> 00:17:01,430
we're not going out for
dinner. Oh No, we're not doing
that. We're not buying that.

289
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,940
Buying your kids used stuff for Christmas,

290
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,190
which I did when I was in the
military. The, okay. You know,

291
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:08,780
I'd love to get you something new,
but guess what?

292
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:13,250
Sometimes Santa Claus bring some
stuff from recycled, recycled goods.

293
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,110
Some other kids didn't want
it. That's fine. If you,

294
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,630
if you don't have that in you to
suck it up and, and live lean,

295
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,140
then you, you don't, then you
need to make different decisions.

296
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,700
Cause cause a lot of times I know
it was like this and like oh seven,

297
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,900
six maybe, um, where guys,

298
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:34,790
like I remember seeing people,

299
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,270
they'd like a lot of people were just
becoming loan officers. Oh yeah for sure.

300
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:41,600
Like flipping houses, you know,
kind of thing. And it's kind of all,

301
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:44,990
they look at it as like
this get rich quick kind of
thing. And then they're like,

302
00:17:44,991 --> 00:17:47,270
yeah, let me just do it. It's either
you have no experience necessary,

303
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:49,800
all this stuff and then
they'll do it all educated.

304
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,380
All like with none of the way
you just said none of that.

305
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,590
And I got a buddy that he,

306
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,310
he was telling me the story cause he
was in the seal teams and during that

307
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:04,460
market boom, during the housing market,
boom, he bought like five houses. Yeah.

308
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,250
And he is so funny to hear him.
He's a humble guy and he's telling him,

309
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,430
telling me the story is 10 years ago,
he's telling me the story, but he's like,

310
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:12,900
he's like,
yeah,

311
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:18,170
when I was doing this I thought
everyone else was so stupid.

312
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,240
I thought it was just the smartest guy
in the world because of what he was doing

313
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:25,320
was getting these loans that he couldn't
afford. But at that time, the, the,

314
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,760
the mortgage people were giving loans
to anybody and he did it and he did it

315
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:32,010
over and over. And so we ended
up with five houses and he said,

316
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:35,400
he remembered asking you another
real estate guy, like, Hey, what if,

317
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:40,380
what if the housing prices go down?
And the guy's like,

318
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:44,010
that's not going to happen. And
if it does, even if it did happen,

319
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,480
you'd have six months to a year to
offload all your properties and it'd be no

320
00:18:48,481 --> 00:18:51,210
problem.
Within a month of that,

321
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,870
the market turned and
he said 30 days later,

322
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,210
every one of his
properties was upside down,

323
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,660
meaning he owed more than
they were worth in 30 days.

324
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,230
And he ended up foreclosing on it.
All those houses, except for one,

325
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,680
he was lucky enough to keep the one that
he lived in anyways. So, yeah. Don't,

326
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,910
you know, be measured. It's balanced.
Don't just get crazy. Yeah. Yeah.

327
00:19:11,911 --> 00:19:14,310
It's not like this.
Get rich like the risks.

328
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,090
I would take was the risk of,
okay,

329
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,800
if things don't go well,

330
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,950
it's going to be a lean
Christmas and I'm okay with that.

331
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,880
If you're not okay with Alene Christmas
and Eileen and not going out for dinner

332
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,660
and buying your kids, use presence for
Christmas. If you're not okay with that,

333
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,040
but you know, what do you want for
your birthday? Oh, you want to,

334
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,710
you want something for your birthday?
Cool.

335
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,430
I'll get you something that resembles
that, but it might not be the act.

336
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,360
If you're not okay with that,
then then don't do it.

337
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,810
I never would gamble the fact
that, okay, if this goes wrong,

338
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:48,570
we won't have anywhere to live.
That's a different,

339
00:19:48,571 --> 00:19:51,630
that's a different level gambled. I didn't
gamble that. I didn't gamble like, okay,

340
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:55,770
if I, if the market goes sideways,
I'm not going to have a place to live.

341
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,100
I didn't gamble that. If the
market goes sideways, Hey,

342
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:03,090
it's going to be a lean Christmas and
even you like by your own admission,

343
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:06,900
you said, I, you know, I do it
where I'd live. Lean kind of thing.

344
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,620
Like you don't have to do it that way.
Like you can be set way more.

345
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:14,250
You could give yourself your yourself
pattern but no risk, no reward,

346
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:20,070
but don't risk everything. The
smart be calculated. So yeah,

347
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,350
buy something. Buy something
when you're young, hang onto it.

348
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:26,580
Rented out by something else. Hang on
to it. Rented out. That's a good plan.

349
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,160
A good longterm plan.
Gotcha.

350
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:34,930
Talk a long term plan. Long term as
the market goes up and down. Yeah.

351
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,070
This is probably good. At least
most of the time anyway. Long term.

352
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,540
Think long term. Think long term. Yes.

353
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,410
Downtime. Do you ever watch mindless
TV? I asked you this question before.

354
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:51,880
Do you ever watch mindless TV or youtube
videos to decompress at the end of the

355
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,320
day or is that laziness justifying
wasted time? You know, quite frankly,

356
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,600
I don't have a lot of
free time to do that.

357
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,910
Even if I was all fired up to watch a
mindless video on youtube. Yeah. Uh,

358
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,540
so I guess,
I guess not really.

359
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:11,350
If I'm going to decompress sometimes.

360
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,170
I mean,

361
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,810
sometimes my kids will want to watch
something and I'll sit there and watch all

362
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:21,140
soon, whatever. Go Watch an episode
of the office or something like that.

363
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,140
It was going be good. Kind of mindless.
Kind of funny. Yeah. Yeah, that's,

364
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,060
that makes sense. Same, same
deal. I think I used to, you know,

365
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:35,170
of course I watched my whole life. Five.
Oh, that's a good one. Kind of mindless.

366
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:39,550
They can tell you this. I've watched zero
w if if they put it on screen or not,

367
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:42,480
I wouldn't even know what it
was. Les From we, we went,

368
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,350
we were in the hotel gym the other day.
It's like,

369
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:47,140
check it out and replace the
TV. I'm like, what? He said,

370
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,120
that's Hawaii five o I even
know what he's talking about.

371
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,900
He took a picture of it. He took a picture
of it. He said he felt your presence.

372
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:55,810
Yeah. It's good. Yeah. That
would have fired me up.

373
00:21:55,811 --> 00:22:00,040
Best workout in the world right there.
[inaudible] we're a gut check.

374
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,590
Next question.
I'm a high school football coach.

375
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,540
When you were in charge of training,
at what point did you use mass punishment,

376
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,270
mass punishment? This basically when
the team's not working together. Gotcha.

377
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:19,330
Right. When the team's not
working together, and that
can take all kinds of forms,

378
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:21,430
right? But if they're, if
they're not working together,

379
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,310
they're going to get punished together.
If they're blaming each other,

380
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,420
they're going to get punished together.
If they're not supporting each other,

381
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,263
they're going to get punished together.

382
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:32,190
One thing that I think with a gray areas
is if you have an individual that's

383
00:22:33,701 --> 00:22:38,620
making mistakes, having problems not
performing correctly, and then the team,

384
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,770
whose responsibility is it to
get that person up to speed?

385
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,100
It's the team's responsibility, so if
that person continually has a problem,

386
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,200
it's like, Hey, if the team
doesn't take care of that problem,

387
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:50,680
then the team has to, has to pay.
Yeah, sure. That makes sense.

388
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,440
Next question.

389
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,300
Instilling and maintaining discipline
in subjective career fields such as

390
00:22:58,301 --> 00:23:00,820
becoming a musician, artists, et cetera.

391
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,110
How do you face the obstacles thrown at
you when you're subjected to people's

392
00:23:05,111 --> 00:23:08,410
opinions to make a living
and not the standard?

393
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,520
Do your job type type of lifestyles?

394
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,630
This, this, this question,

395
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:21,280
I'm not sure if I have an answer that
people are going to want to hear on this

396
00:23:21,281 --> 00:23:22,114
one.

397
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:27,670
I think first of all I originally thought
like okay this is about discipline and

398
00:23:27,671 --> 00:23:30,670
you need discipline to get gooder
craft cause that's for sure, right?

399
00:23:30,671 --> 00:23:35,530
If you want to get good at music
or r or whatever, you got to,

400
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,150
you got to have the
discipline to practice it.

401
00:23:37,151 --> 00:23:38,440
But that's not really
what the questions about.

402
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,390
The questions about how do you survive and

403
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,520
how do you deal with it when people
are might not like what you make. Yeah.

404
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,660
And from my perspective,

405
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:55,840
I think you should do things like art
and music because you really love doing

406
00:23:56,841 --> 00:23:59,690
them and not to make money.
And I think,

407
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,150
I think if you do those things
truthfully from the heart,

408
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:09,650
then it will strike a chord
with other people in many,

409
00:24:09,651 --> 00:24:14,540
many cases because human beings have
whatever human nature is all kind of the

410
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:16,280
same.
And so if you do something,

411
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:20,450
then people will like it and then you
will end up with people that like your

412
00:24:20,451 --> 00:24:21,284
work,

413
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,850
if you're doing art or music
or whatever to make money.

414
00:24:25,851 --> 00:24:27,050
If that's your goal,

415
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:32,570
well then it's going to be subjective and
that's going to be problematic because

416
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:35,060
people might, might not like what
you're doing. And so then what you do,

417
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:37,190
you change it a little bit and then you
change it a little bit and you change a

418
00:24:37,191 --> 00:24:39,830
little bit.
So I dunno,

419
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,130
to me it's like I would rather have
another job that makes me money

420
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:49,310
so I can get by so that I can do what I
want artistically, if that makes sense.

421
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,030
Uh,

422
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:55,030
I actually had a guy the other day
that was like saying you get up early,

423
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,120
but different people that are artistic,

424
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:02,960
they have to have a different
path because they, you know,

425
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:05,710
if someone's gonna gonna make
music or they're going to,

426
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,050
they're going to draw or paint
or they're going to write,

427
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,320
they need to have freedom.
And I was like, well,

428
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:17,360
I've kind of written some books
and I play music in a band.

429
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:21,140
And we make rock and roll.
You know what I mean? Yes.

430
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:25,010
I didn't get all crazy with the guy
was to be like, no, I'm an artist too.

431
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:27,890
I just was like, hey man, you know,

432
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:31,160
if you want to do what you
want man here to help you out.

433
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:35,480
But that's kind of like the too on the
podcast, like a podcast isn't like,

434
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:39,110
oh well we need to do this so that we
can get more people to listen so that we

435
00:25:39,111 --> 00:25:41,690
can get more money. It's no actually,
if you don't want to listen to this,

436
00:25:41,691 --> 00:25:43,790
don't listen and we don't,
we're beholden to no one,

437
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,480
no one advertiser is going to pull their
advertising from us cause we don't have

438
00:25:47,481 --> 00:25:50,390
any.
Yes.

439
00:25:50,391 --> 00:25:55,391
So we can do what we want and not be
worried about what other people think.

440
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,510
And I think when you do that,
here's the, here's the, here's the,

441
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:03,320
the weird,
the thread ties back in.

442
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:06,620
I think if you're doing what you want and
you're creating what you want from the

443
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:10,790
heart, truthfully, when it gets out
there, people, people will get into it.

444
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,953
Next question.

445
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,610
How can I introduce my female boss to
the extreme ownership way without being

446
00:26:16,611 --> 00:26:20,590
offensive? Just sell it as
improvement given the stance before,

447
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,600
give the book to her and tell her that
you read this book and you really like it

448
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:32,210
and you want to become a better leader
and if she could read it and keep you in

449
00:26:32,211 --> 00:26:34,940
check.
If she sees you get not aligned,

450
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,330
she you'd appreciate it and then
just let her read it. Then let the,

451
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,630
let the book work. It was funny, you guys
are talking about this at the muster,

452
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:44,520
I think late. Maybe you said
it. Maybe they said, I don't
know, but you were like,

453
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,930
I'll tell you how you don't do it.

454
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,100
Throw the book at her and say you need
to square yourself away. Read this book.

455
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:53,640
And of course that was fun. Not Good. No.

456
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,480
Next question, do you experience
loneliness while at the top?

457
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:05,520
It's lonely at the top. You ever
heard that expression? If so,

458
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:07,560
how did you handle it? You
know, actually not really.

459
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,690
And I guess from my perspective,

460
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:12,540
I look at the top being when I was in
leadership position and I was a platoon

461
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:16,180
commander or a task unit
commander or the commander of the,

462
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:19,320
the training detachment, was it
lonely at the top? Not Really, man.

463
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:23,130
I had friends and people that are hung
out with and people that I would trust to

464
00:27:23,131 --> 00:27:27,060
talk and have conversations with
and so that wasn't really a factor.

465
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:28,020
And then on top of that,

466
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:33,030
I actually don't really mind being alone.
It's not a big deal to me.

467
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:36,390
I don't feel lonely when I'm
by myself. I'm fine, I'm fine.

468
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,590
Somebody asked me the other day,
are you an introvert or an extrovert?

469
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,200
And I was like, mom, probably
both. And they're like, no, no,

470
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:45,670
but you have to be one of course,
cause right, right. They said,

471
00:27:45,671 --> 00:27:50,670
so the test or whatever, and I said,
um, I said, well, I don't care.

472
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,230
I literally don't care. Well, like if I'm
in a room with a bunch of people, okay,

473
00:27:55,231 --> 00:28:00,120
if I'm in a room with by myself, don't
care, whatever, bring it. No big deal.

474
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:04,510
Yeah. I think that extrovert,
if I'm not mistaken, like,

475
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,340
like has the need, you know, like they're,

476
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:12,230
they're attracted to other people being
there. Yes. So I guess that's what I said.

477
00:28:12,231 --> 00:28:17,220
I'm like, yeah, that's fine. Whatever.
Don't care alone. So, so yeah,

478
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:21,150
I, you know, and I always, like
I said, I had friends that do,

479
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,460
I trusted it and weren't,

480
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:27,620
weren't like we're good enough friends
that they weren't going to be trying to

481
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,530
get their own gain out of being my friend,
you know,

482
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:37,260
people that were friends with me before
I was in a leadership position and

483
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,830
people that remain friends after, so not,
not that big of a deal to me. You know,

484
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:45,300
luckily I guess I'm lucky cause I mean,
it must be a thing if everyone says it.

485
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:50,070
Yeah. And I guess maybe like I'll tell
you what you do, you do, you work,

486
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,030
I'll tell you this, this is you, when
you, when you're, when you're at the top,

487
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:56,190
when you're an owner or you're the leader,

488
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,870
there's times where you have
to do things by herself. Yeah.

489
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,680
There's no doubt about that.
And if you have a problem with that,

490
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:04,680
you're going to have a problem being in
a leadership position because there's

491
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:07,280
things that you have to do as leader.
You have to lead from the front, right?

492
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,950
You have to work harder.
You have to do extra you.

493
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,790
You should be working
harder than everyone else.

494
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,760
When you're in a leadership position
of an organization, no doubt about it.

495
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:19,650
And if you're not working harder,
that's not good. And if you're,

496
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,330
if you're working harder,

497
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,880
there's gonna be times when
you're not with anyone else,

498
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:27,000
and you have to be okay with that. And
I'm perfectly okay with that. Don't care.

499
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,480
And that's actually what,
that's what that expression means.

500
00:29:30,481 --> 00:29:31,380
It's lonely at the top,

501
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:35,550
meaning like you're at the top because
you're willing to be in a general way of

502
00:29:35,551 --> 00:29:40,520
putting it, behave or be a certain way
that other people either can't write.

503
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,280
So you're not going to be able
to relate from that perspective.

504
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,620
But you're definitely lonely at the top.

505
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:49,270
There's no one that's going to sit there
and do what I'm willing to do to be

506
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:52,870
there. Yeah. Like where are you at
pawn? Don't know, haven't seen you,

507
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,210
but I'm up here by myself, but I'm
gonna keep getting after it. Right.

508
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,270
That's kind of the way. Yeah. That's
how people end up in those positions.

509
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,510
You don't end up in those positions.
You don't get gifted positions.

510
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:05,790
You don't just get end up. I shouldn't
say never, but I didn't. Yeah, sure.

511
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:11,200
Yeah. Had to grind it out, keep grinding
it out. I think. Yeah. You know what,

512
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:12,040
thinking about this question,

513
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:17,041
I think what you said doesn't surprise
me at all because as a human being,

514
00:30:17,531 --> 00:30:21,640
I think we all kind of,
maybe sometimes we do,

515
00:30:21,641 --> 00:30:26,110
sometimes we don't admit that it is
good and nice to have like someone there

516
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,950
kind of supporting you in
this way. Where, where,

517
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,260
where you kind of feel like, oh your
feelings matter kind of thing. Yeah.

518
00:30:35,261 --> 00:30:35,951
It sounds super soft,

519
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:38,050
but it's like kind of deep down
inside where like let's say,

520
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,860
you know how like you know the no listen,

521
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:45,070
so you know the idea that like
people just don't understand.

522
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,620
You know that concept.
People just don't get it.

523
00:30:47,621 --> 00:30:50,680
They don't understand or whatever.
So when you go to the top,

524
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,370
that feeling is everyone everywhere
that people just don't understand.

525
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,170
This is the difference.
I don't look at it.

526
00:30:56,171 --> 00:30:59,530
People in a negative light because they
don't get it. I'm fine with it. Yeah.

527
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,350
Like I recognize that.
What I'm,

528
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:07,180
I recognize that I'm not 100%
normal and I'm, I'm not, it's not,

529
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,310
I don't look down. Right. I actually, I
said this word, I just get interviewed.

530
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:13,601
Oh,

531
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:18,601
I got interviewed on business
insider by [inaudible] and he's like,

532
00:31:19,361 --> 00:31:20,940
well, do you always keep your
discipline? I was like, no.

533
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,740
People get out of the seal teams and
they get fat and they don't care anymore.

534
00:31:23,741 --> 00:31:26,270
And it's like, I don't, I don't care
about that. I'm stoked. You know,

535
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,960
that means they're stoked and eating
breakfast in bed and they're hanging out

536
00:31:28,961 --> 00:31:31,810
with your kids. It's all good. I don't,
I don't have a negative opinion of them.

537
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,261
She's like,

538
00:31:32,261 --> 00:31:35,230
I don't have a negative opinion of someone
that prioritizes things differently

539
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:39,190
than me. It's fine. It's
perfectly fine. Yeah. I get it.

540
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,290
That that's what point and I'm okay.

541
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,720
I'm okay with that and I'm
not looking around going, wow,

542
00:31:43,721 --> 00:31:46,030
I wish I had more people to hang out with.
It's lonely up here.

543
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:49,530
That's exactly what lonely at the top is.
Yeah. Yeah. And there was a, there was a,

544
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,680
when I was in my first seal platoon I,
we went to Guam.

545
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,890
When we got there there was a guy,
and I don't even know who did it.

546
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,840
I don't know where this,
I don't know who this was,

547
00:31:58,841 --> 00:32:02,470
but there was a seal that left like
a, a surf ski. You know what that is?

548
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,180
It's basically like a kayak that you
sit on top of anyways and there's just a

549
00:32:07,181 --> 00:32:10,180
little, a little, a little note
to himself. It said the higher,

550
00:32:10,181 --> 00:32:14,050
the fewer meaning like hey when you,
cause he was training hard for it.

551
00:32:14,051 --> 00:32:16,450
I didn't know who he lost to set.
The higher, the higher, the fewer.

552
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,040
So that's the same thing.
Yeah. I'm going to shoot with
him. Yeah. Okay. Makes Sense.

553
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,130
Yeah man. So like, you know when
you're in the office working,

554
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,220
you know that you tell kids too, cause
that's a whole bullying thing is people,

555
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,420
kids, kids get the feeling
that being alone is bad.

556
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:35,680
Like being alone is not a bad thing. You
should be comfortable being alone. Yeah.

557
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:39,870
Yeah. And as a normal human, it's key.

558
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:43,640
I think for the most part,
okay. Being alone is one thing,

559
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:48,140
but being alone with no choices and
other, so like if, if you, you know,

560
00:32:48,141 --> 00:32:51,110
you're at the office cause you just
grind all day, you're at the top,

561
00:32:51,111 --> 00:32:53,690
slowly at the top, whatever you're
in the office, you're working,

562
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,650
everyone else is out at uh, you
know, thanksgiving, whatever.

563
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,960
But you're working because you
got to work, you're at the top,

564
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:03,710
you're still the man, but you're working,
you know, kind of thing. Some people,

565
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,530
not you, some people will
be like, man, you know,

566
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:11,000
like I'm in this top position
but I give up. Like all of these,

567
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:14,240
you definitely give things, you know,
and yeah, exactly right. But again,

568
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:16,800
you say you're okay with it.
I get it. Of course. Yeah.

569
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,450
And if it gets to a point where I'm not
okay with it, then I adjust the balance.

570
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:23,240
There you go. Okay.
That's how you deal with,

571
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:27,310
they're just about what you're going
to be playing. The longterm Dame. Yeah.

572
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:32,450
Not the short term gratification
check.

573
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:33,503
Swish.

574
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:40,090
Would you ever consider being
in the reboot of the office?

575
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:44,750
All, you mentioned the office, that's why
events, I'd read the questions earlier,

576
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,030
but kind of in my head layers.

577
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:52,610
Do you like Dwight Schrute the best
Shrute to Dennis aright. Shrek.

578
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:57,080
Dwight Schrute. What's wrong with
your shoe? True farms. Yeah. Uh,

579
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,890
the officer's a great show and my kids
are obsessed with the office for some

580
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:03,380
reason, so I watched the
office sometimes with them.

581
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:08,800
There's a British version of the office
and I actually prefer the British

582
00:34:09,351 --> 00:34:13,820
version of the office,
I guess because it's just my personality.

583
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:17,300
But the British version, the is
kind of depressing. No, it's funny,

584
00:34:17,301 --> 00:34:21,290
but it's Kinda depressing because
the American one goes over the top.

585
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,260
The characters are over the top. They
are an extreme. So they're funny. Yeah.

586
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:31,280
You Go, oh, that's funny. For, for
the boss to have that attitude.

587
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,600
It's a caricature.

588
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,320
The British one is toned back just
enough that it's more realistic and it's,

589
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:44,210
it's a little bit depressing and
that's what my kid, I told my kids,

590
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,160
you got to watch the British one.
The British one is much better.

591
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,340
And my kids watching them, like, I don't
want to watch that. It's depressing.

592
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:54,350
So yeah, that's great. And Dwight
Schrute is an awesome character. Yes.

593
00:34:54,351 --> 00:34:58,740
Because it kind of, because everyone
knows a Dwight Schrute who's Dwight truth.

594
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:03,230
He's a character in the office.
I mean, I've seen it and stuff,

595
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:07,100
but I don't know the names of the guys.
He's a guy with glasses like this,

596
00:35:07,101 --> 00:35:11,270
self defense and Dorky.
Sorry,

597
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:17,150
check. So you would be in it if they're
like reboot of the office. Hey Jocko,

598
00:35:17,151 --> 00:35:21,980
we want you to be Dwight Schrute
or whoever I could be. Yeah,

599
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:26,070
let's the main guy's name.
Michael. Right? The character,
I mean, yeah, the boss. Yeah.

600
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,090
Michael. Actually, what's funny
is when you watch that show,

601
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,730
you can see leadership
issues. Yeah. There go there.

602
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,500
Do you see the glaring leadership issues?

603
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,740
It's a good little good little lessons
learned for leadership in there. Yeah,

604
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,040
sure. So who do you be? Who's
your choice? Hey Jocko. Oh,

605
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:43,950
I'd have to be one of the people that are
in there. Yeah, this is a we'll reboot.

606
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,700
It would be cool as be a super
hardcore version of Dwight Schrute.

607
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:51,600
Like a Yes for our core version of
Dwight shirts. That'd be pretty funny.

608
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:55,170
Well isn't the whole co like comic genius
behind the character of Dwight Schrute

609
00:35:55,171 --> 00:35:59,190
is that he's so Dorky, like a
Napoleon dynamite type guy, right?

610
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:03,750
Like he's like so dorky but use
like this bar hardcore droid shirt.

611
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,930
So you could be some hard core,
but it'd be inverse. You'd be,

612
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,740
you'd be dis Dorky like your dog.
You know,

613
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,880
how do I treat it as trying to sell the,
his hardcore in this,

614
00:36:11,881 --> 00:36:16,050
but he's just defeat any character
to the extreme can be funny. Yeah.

615
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:19,590
So in your case, actually if you,
if you like when I'm on Twitter,

616
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:24,090
I take my character, you know,
where someone says, what's,

617
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,450
what's a good dessert steak?
Just having fun.

618
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,580
You're like text message too, by the
way. Just so everyone knows. So yeah.

619
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:36,900
So your character is hardcore, underlying
hardcore. That's like the known thing,

620
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,770
but then you're trying to be all out of
like smart or something like, you know,

621
00:36:40,771 --> 00:36:44,630
like a, like a studious. This
is for the [inaudible]. Yeah.

622
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,060
I'm not worried about it. I
don't know man. That's how it is.

623
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:52,590
Looking at the classic well
Huh. All right. Next question.

624
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:58,370
Has seen kids in hellholes ever made
parenting harder for you leaving or not

625
00:36:59,821 --> 00:37:03,870
leaving kids? Not really. Uh, when, uh,

626
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,810
when I was overseas and you'd
see kids in horrible situations,

627
00:37:06,811 --> 00:37:11,811
it just makes you appreciate
the opportunity that you
have to provide for your

628
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:15,150
kids and to try and help
those kids as much as you can.

629
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:19,170
So I don't think it made
parenting harder for me. Yeah.

630
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:25,440
Yeah. It makes you appreciative of the
opportunities that we have. For sure.

631
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:30,600
Yeah. I feel like I know that
question where, yeah, when,

632
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:34,020
if I see like kids in hellholes it,
it doesn't make it harder,

633
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:37,890
but it makes it like you're
more sensitive, you know,

634
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:42,960
like stuff just affects you more with
your kids. I Dunno. In my experience.

635
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:45,460
That's what happened.
Cause you kind of can't be that way.

636
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,550
Like it messes you up when you see like,

637
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,630
like my wife will read like a trafficking,

638
00:37:51,631 --> 00:37:54,740
like human trafficking or
and stuff and you see people,

639
00:37:54,741 --> 00:37:56,160
whether it be pictures or video,
whatever.

640
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,370
And so it kind of leaves a mark
in your brain. So I don't know,

641
00:37:59,371 --> 00:38:02,370
maybe you're just playing everyday kind
of stuff and you see your kid and you're

642
00:38:02,371 --> 00:38:03,001
like,
Dang,

643
00:38:03,001 --> 00:38:07,830
you can't help but remember those pictures
and do a comparison that'll make you

644
00:38:07,831 --> 00:38:11,220
paranoid. Do in a good way. Yeah.
Yeah. Be careful with your kids.

645
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,470
There's evil people out there for sure.

646
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:19,620
Next question.
How do you reduce your bosses?

647
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,880
Anxiety levels do a really good job.
You know what I mean?

648
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,130
Stay ahead of the power curve.
Do a really good job.

649
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:30,570
Keep them informed and kick ass.
And that's how you relieve your bosses.

650
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,700
Anxiety. Step Up. Yeah.

651
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,280
That's good advice for your wife too,
by the way.

652
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:44,100
We're leaving your wife's anxiety
levels. Yeah, for sure. Take lead, right?

653
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:48,730
Not Lead like, oh you know, call all
the shots necessarily. But you know,

654
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:54,250
if, if, if you guys are trying to figure
out where to go for dinner, boom, call it,

655
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,640
call it man. Don't be like, oh,
whatever you want, don't do that.

656
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:02,680
Don't create the leadership
void. Don't do that. Check.

657
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,410
I learned that from you by the way.
Next question.

658
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:09,700
Trying to keep in shape while
traveling long term and not use,

659
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,850
not having gym access as an excuse
for letting my standard slip.

660
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:18,090
Best pieces of kit training styles from
maintaining conditioning and adding mass

661
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:23,680
while living out of the backpack.
Get rings. It rings good.

662
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,720
Gymnastics would,
gymnastic rings.

663
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,950
Why would plastic or metal will
make you get sweaty and slept?

664
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:32,140
And you have to bring a ton of chalk
and you need a little bit of chocolate.

665
00:39:32,141 --> 00:39:32,711
The Wood rings,

666
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:35,860
it's a little one resorb and there's
the best thing to grab onto get would

667
00:39:35,861 --> 00:39:36,790
gymnastic rings.

668
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:40,180
You can carry them anywhere and then
just do a bunch of calisthenics. I mean,

669
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:43,720
come on man.
Just on a knows what adding mass,

670
00:39:43,721 --> 00:39:46,620
how has ed mess can slit? Oh,
you gotta get creative. Yeah,

671
00:39:46,621 --> 00:39:49,990
you've got to get creative.
But it's do you know,

672
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,420
instead of doing squats,
you know,

673
00:39:52,421 --> 00:39:55,180
air squats do jump squats
or doing some dynamic.

674
00:39:55,181 --> 00:39:58,510
Do you ever wonder why our metrics?
Yeah. Do one legged pistols. Yeah.

675
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:02,950
All that stuff. Yeah. Yeah.
That's the key. I got to do
that right now. Like I can't,

676
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:07,510
you can't build a hole in my,
this is called the Ulna boom.

677
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,530
So they drilled a hole in the attached
to the 10 and nut in the hole. They go,

678
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,330
they push the 10 in through the hole.

679
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:17,380
They put an anchor at the
end of the boom anyway.

680
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:20,590
A lot of swelling in the forearm.
You can't grab nothing,

681
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:25,540
you can't grab anything and have weight.
So Calisthenics,

682
00:40:25,541 --> 00:40:27,940
you've got to kind of make your position,
your wrists in a position,

683
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,930
in a comfortable position and
you can do calisthenics. Anyway.

684
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,071
Point there is,

685
00:40:33,071 --> 00:40:36,940
I'm in that boat where lifting weights
is not an option at this very moment for

686
00:40:36,941 --> 00:40:41,770
me. So you got to kind of get
creative. So like a push up.

687
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,230
You can make the pushups harder.

688
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:47,020
If you put your feet up in the
higher you put your feet, you know,

689
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,130
the harder it becomes.

690
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:52,370
Or you do like a one arm pushups situation
and then you can do like a decline,

691
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,480
like um, you know, you go on
a counter first, right? Okay.

692
00:40:55,481 --> 00:40:58,180
How many of these one arm pushups?
You can do more than 20. Okay.

693
00:40:58,181 --> 00:41:01,480
Maybe you go for like a chair or
something like this. Something, something,

694
00:41:01,481 --> 00:41:06,370
a shorter boom. You can do more than 20 of
those. Okay. Now I can go to the ground,

695
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:10,620
see what I'm saying? And then you can go
raise your feet up as time goes on. Boom.

696
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,460
There you go.
Good for.

697
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:17,570
And actually bodyweight through space
is the best way to build size in your

698
00:41:18,251 --> 00:41:22,570
muscles there. As far as like
exercises go, it's good information.

699
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,980
It is better than dead
lifting and squatting. Well,
okay, so that dead lifting,

700
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,600
squatting, that's going to be d
is going to depend on the weight.

701
00:41:31,601 --> 00:41:34,160
But think about this.
Dead lifting and

702
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,560
squatting is moving
your body through space.

703
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,470
So do an air squat.

704
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,370
You're moving your body through space
as opposed to men squatting with weight,

705
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:47,680
right? Back Squat. Right, right,
right. But when I'm squat, yeah,

706
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:52,610
duty heavy with squats yet,
but again, like I said,

707
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:57,080
moving your body through space is the,

708
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,510
are the best exercises for mass.

709
00:41:59,511 --> 00:42:03,590
What is what is not moving your body
through a squat compared to a leg press.

710
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,350
So if people haven't,
even though those aren't even in my,

711
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:10,430
those aren't even in my mind I know about,
but this guy asking the question,

712
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:14,360
it might be, I'm trying to help him
out. I don't want to help you out.

713
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,910
You got the whole exercise
thing figured out. I get it.

714
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:20,690
You know you're an expert
in your boring workups.

715
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,580
Talk about that later.
Nonetheless,

716
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,310
the body weight or body moving your
body through space is the best exercise.

717
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:33,020
The problem is or tends to be that your
body has a fixed amount of weight more

718
00:42:33,021 --> 00:42:33,854
or less.

719
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:37,640
So you can't adjust the weight and usually
you can move your body through space

720
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:40,580
a bunch of times. If you do air squats,
you can do a bunch of air squats.

721
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:45,050
So it doesn't provide the quote unquote
tension that you need to build mass.

722
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,730
That's what you go one at a time.

723
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:50,870
Create more tension on your muscles while
still moving your body through space,

724
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:54,980
which could wind up to be a better
exercise for you. That's what I'm saying.

725
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,470
That's good advice man. Whatever. Brad,

726
00:42:57,471 --> 00:42:59,300
don't act like it's crazy
that I'm saying this stuff.

727
00:42:59,301 --> 00:43:03,650
That's the question really the question
with this whole moving your body through

728
00:43:03,651 --> 00:43:08,390
space thing. Yeah, that's the
information. I have no idea what that,

729
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:10,010
I kind of get it now.

730
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,240
But you were saying it as
if it was some unknown.

731
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:18,710
It is unknown.
If your body through space,

732
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,970
you know what a hammer strength machine
is. Okay, so it's, you know, it's like a,

733
00:43:22,971 --> 00:43:26,960
it's like a, I dunno like a lever kind of
thing. Technically it's like, you know,

734
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,810
you put some plates on it, you push
it, there's no pull or nothing,

735
00:43:29,811 --> 00:43:32,440
but you know you're never moving your
body through space and I'm moving in your

736
00:43:32,441 --> 00:43:33,081
body through space.

737
00:43:33,081 --> 00:43:36,620
So I'm kind of creating the spectrum
here so could just consider that.

738
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:40,490
Then it's kind of far down this other
movement or things that are further down

739
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:43,940
the spectrum, but that's fixed
movement. There's no balance required.

740
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,700
There's no whatever.
It's just like you're just pushing late.

741
00:43:46,701 --> 00:43:50,570
It's isolation movements, right?
Plane, the plane is isolated.

742
00:43:50,571 --> 00:43:52,700
All this to the plane of movement,
right?

743
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:57,560
So that we'll have less neuro
muscular activity when you push it.

744
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:01,550
Even if you're pushing heavy weights,
then something like graduate too,

745
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:06,110
like a barbell bench press,
right? For example. But even that,

746
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:09,200
even though you do have to balance,
so that's a big step up,

747
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:11,660
but even that you don't have
to balance in certain planes,

748
00:44:11,661 --> 00:44:14,640
certain planes of movement,
you don't have to balance like the,

749
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:16,850
what do you call this one lateral,
whatever,

750
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,450
the lateral movement and a barbell
bench press, which is the bar.

751
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:23,000
You don't have to balance.
It's fixed,

752
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:27,260
but front and back or forward for new
back, whatever. You do have to balance.

753
00:44:27,261 --> 00:44:31,050
So you know it's still good.
Now go to dumbbells,

754
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,610
now you have 360

755
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:37,610
degree plane of movement that you have
to balance more neuro muscular activity.

756
00:44:38,941 --> 00:44:40,950
So dumbbells are better
than barbells in that way.

757
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,830
There were muscular activity
and you can adjust the weight.

758
00:44:43,831 --> 00:44:46,230
So you can do things where you can
only do three reps. You can do things,

759
00:44:46,231 --> 00:44:49,140
you can do 20 reps if you
want. So boom, great exercise.

760
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,010
Can't really do it in a hotel room,
but just saying, generally speaking,

761
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,920
good exercise.
But now you go the tip top.

762
00:44:55,950 --> 00:45:00,950
The best exercise for neuro muscular
activity would be pushups because same

763
00:45:02,611 --> 00:45:05,370
thing, you're moving your body
through space. You're not balancing,

764
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:08,610
weighing and balancing your rings.
Boom. Then I'll get even better.

765
00:45:08,611 --> 00:45:11,640
Now you're going like creative, which is
good. That's like beyond the spectrum,

766
00:45:11,641 --> 00:45:16,140
which is good. Totally good. But
so yeah, keep these things in mind.

767
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:20,090
I think when you, when you do a thing,
wait, so if you can add or window workout.

768
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,830
So when you, if you can add
weight, that's the challenge.

769
00:45:22,831 --> 00:45:27,150
If you can add weight to these,
moving your body through space exercises,

770
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:31,500
that's when you need it. Again, I'm just
going to take this one step further.

771
00:45:31,501 --> 00:45:36,480
Do it because you don't necessarily have
to add weight as you stated earlier.

772
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:37,020
Yes,

773
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:42,020
you can adjust how you're moving your
body through space and then you can get

774
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,950
the,
you can get additional,

775
00:45:43,951 --> 00:45:47,190
and I'll tell you what really makes
us obvious as if you do any gymnastics

776
00:45:47,191 --> 00:45:51,630
training. If you do a
pull up, that's hard.

777
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:56,100
If you do a talk, pull up where your
knees are pulled up, that's even harder.

778
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,630
If you do a l sit,
pull up where your knees are up,

779
00:46:00,631 --> 00:46:04,200
put your feet are pointed straight
forward. That's even harder.

780
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:07,530
Each one of those things is a little
bit harder. And same thing with a dip,

781
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,430
like just a regular dip.
Your feet hanging,

782
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:13,740
it's easier if you bring it up
to a talk is a little harder.

783
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:16,770
If you bring it up to an l,
it's even harder.

784
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:20,850
So you can keep doing these things
and there's squats that you can do.

785
00:46:20,851 --> 00:46:24,540
I mean just doing pistols alone,
that's a lot harder.

786
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,450
Some people can't even do pistols.
Yeah.

787
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:30,960
And so you might have to do an assisted
pistol. We'll start off. Yeah. So yeah,

788
00:46:30,961 --> 00:46:33,240
you can make it happen.
Pistols, got a hard men,

789
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:36,150
especially if you've never done it before
because it's hard because the balance

790
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:41,370
back and side to side balance
360 degree plane of balancing,

791
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,800
that's what this whole thing's about
moving your body through space is

792
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:52,230
where'd you read that? Uh, old
school. A Bulgarian Phil Philosophy,

793
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:57,860
philosophy workout program called there's
the old school never deviated from it

794
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:02,220
much. The core really good too,
by the way. Um, it's called,

795
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,840
he called, I remember serious growth
is what is called weird. Right.

796
00:47:06,841 --> 00:47:10,980
Like that's such a lame name. But man,
I was in high school and I was like,

797
00:47:10,981 --> 00:47:12,990
all right, you know, you read all
these things right. And you know,

798
00:47:12,991 --> 00:47:14,690
in the back of the, uh, you know,

799
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,400
Muscle magazine or whatever
and the little article,

800
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:21,120
I remember all the Bulgari
and it was Kinda like, uh,

801
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:24,020
that was a big thing.
No kidding. Well Gary,

802
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:26,570
well yeah cause the Bulgarians were
doing really good at weightlifting. Yeah.

803
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:30,010
Quiet. No one knew. It
was weird. And these guys

804
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:33,160
were like, yeah, five weeks or four
weeks, my bench went up to this.

805
00:47:33,161 --> 00:47:34,990
And you know when you're in
high school band heck yet,

806
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:36,160
but I'll get that or whatever.

807
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:40,030
So you get the prominences book and it's
just got serious growth and it explains

808
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:42,760
everything really in detail too. I
was like, Dang, this is pretty good.

809
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:45,550
Real plain English to not alders
rural science or whatever.

810
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:50,050
And maybe they're still, and they
were doing kido too, by the way.

811
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:53,610
That's where I learned about
ketones is 90 that's crazy.

812
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:55,370
It's been around for a long time.
For name.

813
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:58,620
The Atkins book came out in
the sixties or seventies yeah.

814
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:03,460
That's way different though. It's not,
it's not a way different way. Different.

815
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:06,730
Yeah. This was, this guy is been
around for a long time. Yeah. Maher,

816
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,640
Dr Mario or Morro de Pasqual.

817
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:15,250
That's who was the Quito Gut. And
again, back in 94 he's still around.

818
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:18,520
Yeah, no kidding. So yeah,
so we did this thing,

819
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:21,790
we get this book and it's like
laying it out and you know,

820
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:26,530
I'm down 1516 years old.
I'm down to lift five days a week.

821
00:48:26,531 --> 00:48:30,220
Let's do this and brow. We
did it. And you eat good.

822
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:34,510
Not like crazy. I didn't do the
ketone never did. Um, but you know,

823
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:37,580
they have it as an option and
so we did or whatever. And we,

824
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:42,310
it was weird since I gained
like 20 pounds and I just,

825
00:48:42,311 --> 00:48:45,160
we just kept doing it. So, you know, you
played football, you can't really gain,

826
00:48:45,161 --> 00:48:48,730
there's also this whole thing that you're
15 and your body's just filled with

827
00:48:48,731 --> 00:48:53,200
testosterone.
You were going to gain 16 pounds anyways,

828
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,080
I'm telling you,
I'll tell you this right now.

829
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:59,470
I was talking to Jody Mitic about this
briefly too. I'll tell you this right now.

830
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:02,380
If even at 40 you go on this thing,

831
00:49:02,381 --> 00:49:06,580
it depends on the train going,
this, this type of work.

832
00:49:06,581 --> 00:49:08,620
And I'm not even like selling this
work on it or nothing like that.

833
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:12,010
I'm saying this'll, people will
think you know what though? Okay.

834
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:15,550
People will think you're on steroids if
you do this workout for like six weeks,

835
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:18,190
that's it. Six weeks, they'll think
you're on steroids. Straight up.

836
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:22,510
Like my whole life when I'd like go on a,
on a like a six week thing, they're all,

837
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,970
he's on steroids. Obviously.
He's on Sir. No Sir.

838
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:28,450
You don't even have to take supplements.
That's the weird thing. But here,

839
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,500
let me say this though,

840
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:32,860
now that I'm thinking of it as or
about it when I'm a grown adult,

841
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:35,260
most programs,

842
00:49:35,261 --> 00:49:39,310
if you actually do the whole
program exactly what works.

843
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:44,200
It works really good. That's the thing.
People just don't do the workout. Oh,

844
00:49:44,201 --> 00:49:49,120
what do you need to do? Lift heavy
weights a lot. Eat good interest. Good.

845
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:53,290
Yes. Yeah. You'll get, and
let's, and let's face it,

846
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,460
it's not eat. Like if someone says,
Oh yeah, it's easy. Cause the thing,

847
00:49:57,461 --> 00:50:00,280
it's not easy. This is why it's not
easy. It's not just the workout.

848
00:50:00,281 --> 00:50:01,630
That's why you have to do the workout.

849
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,390
Then you have to eat enough of
the right things too, by the way.

850
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:07,000
And then you have to arrest enough.
That's basically,

851
00:50:07,001 --> 00:50:09,580
you have to change your whole life.
So if you're like, hey, it's easy,

852
00:50:09,581 --> 00:50:12,640
just change your whole life.
It's not easy. And not that,

853
00:50:12,641 --> 00:50:14,530
I'm not saying that that's a
good excuse or to anything,

854
00:50:14,531 --> 00:50:19,300
but I'm just saying it's not quote unquote
easy, but yet there it is. Do Diet,

855
00:50:19,301 --> 00:50:22,690
exercise, eat good workup,
good and rest good.

856
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:26,860
You'd be good hotel or Jim,
actually, here's what you can do.

857
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:27,980
Here's what I do when I

858
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,600
go to the muster or wherever. If I'm there
for like a week, like the last muster,

859
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:37,760
all like go on Google maps and find like
all the gyms and be like, all right,

860
00:50:37,761 --> 00:50:40,760
I'm going to get, that's kind
of the commitment. Obviously,

861
00:50:40,761 --> 00:50:42,650
you know that's an interest.
That's your commitment.

862
00:50:42,651 --> 00:50:46,310
Like you want to stay in shape, add mass
as you say, conditioning, adding mass,

863
00:50:46,311 --> 00:50:50,380
whatever. Look for the gym near Your
House. Commit to pay that Jim feed.

864
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:54,560
She's like, what, 10 bucks
or something like that. And
boom. That's the commitment,

865
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:59,420
right? Do that. That's what I do. Same
thing. Would you just sit, by the way,

866
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:05,360
next question.
Forgive or wait to settle the score.

867
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:08,420
Uh,
you know what?

868
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:13,970
This is kind of a question
that, okay, so forgive.

869
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:17,690
If you can forgive people for them,
that's cool. Now here's the thing.

870
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,510
You got that little thing in the back of
your mind because you want to settle a

871
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:24,670
score. I know. I don't forget. God, I
love to tell you like, Hey, just forgiven.

872
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:27,560
Forget. Right? But it's
hard to do that sometimes,

873
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:31,920
especially if all certain situations
merit, you know, a little bit, a little.

874
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:35,390
It's hard to make that happen. A little,
a little something extra special.

875
00:51:35,391 --> 00:51:36,320
But this is what's interesting.

876
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:41,470
Forgiving someone is actually
a form of settling the score.

877
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:45,590
If you can think about this.
So for me,

878
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:50,870
the best revenge you can take
on someone is success, right?

879
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:55,990
Is ignoring them and the best revenge
is not even letting them know that you

880
00:51:57,951 --> 00:52:02,810
even think about them anymore. Yeah.
That's the best revenge in my mind.

881
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:06,740
So you forgive them and you just move on.
I think that's the best thing to do.

882
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,460
Forgive them,

883
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:12,050
move on and go kick ass in the world and
the little part of your brain that will

884
00:52:12,051 --> 00:52:16,280
really wants to take revenge. You'll be
taking the best possible revenge you can.

885
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:20,450
You'll be doing it in the best possible
way and it'll be the best for you as a

886
00:52:20,451 --> 00:52:25,100
human being. Yeah. So that's
what you do. Yeah. Yeah.

887
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:28,400
I forgive you and then you go kick ass.
Yeah.

888
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:33,410
Forgiving someone for real, like
for real, for real. Forgiving them.

889
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:38,030
It's really hard. Even if you do take
the highroad behavior wise on the inside,

890
00:52:38,031 --> 00:52:39,050
it's like you kind of don't,

891
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,850
there's this guide to high school and
actually wasn't even in high school was

892
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:47,660
you're still holding high school grudges?
No. Uh, well I guess technically, yeah,

893
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:53,570
it's still there. Like if there was
like, if he were to see, I don't know,

894
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:57,050
something good that I did like now
and be like, aw man, he's doing good.

895
00:52:57,051 --> 00:53:00,200
That would give me satisfaction
right now technically yet.

896
00:53:00,201 --> 00:53:02,720
Still that little something. Yeah. But um,

897
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:08,710
if it's to forgive someone fully
to be too to a point where,

898
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:13,760
Oh yeah, if you saw that I was doing
great now, or something like that, um,

899
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,380
and that wouldn't move me either way.
To get to that point is we're super hard.

900
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:20,930
So I think just like how you said,

901
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:25,590
like the behavior that you want to
kind of do you want to enact yeah.

902
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:26,070
Is,

903
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,790
um, is, yeah. Don't let it bother
you. And here's the thing with,

904
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:33,420
don't not letting it, not
letting it bother you. Don't
let it affect you at all.

905
00:53:33,421 --> 00:53:36,660
Like no factor. Like you almost like you
didn't even notice kind of thing. Yeah.

906
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:41,130
Okay. So that's hard to
do. But if you can do that,

907
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:45,140
if you can pull that off bread, that's
the worst for the other person I'm saying.

908
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:47,770
So like you ever,
you ever had like uh,

909
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:53,280
exactly what I'm saying Bro. I'll get
this. Where did I say he's, you know,

910
00:53:53,281 --> 00:53:55,770
you think to yourself tank.
Did I say something to Piss that guy off?

911
00:53:55,771 --> 00:53:59,670
Whoever it is, whatever. I
don't know. Somebody or that
girl or whatever. Oh shoot.

912
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:03,450
Did I say something? Or they offended or
whatever and you just don't quite know.

913
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:06,570
But it's not big enough to bring up
so you can't bring it up and get that

914
00:54:06,571 --> 00:54:10,410
satisfaction of knowing, you know.
But if they don't just don't say any.

915
00:54:10,411 --> 00:54:13,470
Let's say they were offended say don't
even like you, but they just don't,

916
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:18,560
don't like talk to you rather than if
they ignore you or don't acknowledge that

917
00:54:19,681 --> 00:54:22,230
you said something or something like that.
That's way more.

918
00:54:22,231 --> 00:54:24,030
That bothers you way more than them,

919
00:54:24,031 --> 00:54:28,530
like cussing you out or
something or yelling at you
or like Super Mad at you and

920
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:33,060
them telling you they're mad at you
is way more like satisfying. Yeah,

921
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:37,850
and them not. If you just go stem,
forgive them and move on. Yeah.

922
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,420
But if you go stem,

923
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:45,690
you can't overly ghost like you can't
overly ignore. Just be like, hey. Yeah,

924
00:54:45,691 --> 00:54:48,940
like literally like, yeah, all
good. Oh yeah, it's good to see you.

925
00:54:48,941 --> 00:54:53,470
And I haven't said that's
why if something's going
good for you, if that's what,

926
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:57,660
if you're mad at someone and they
text you like, Hey, you know, oh,

927
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:00,390
and if you give them like one word
answers or you don't text him back,

928
00:55:00,391 --> 00:55:03,120
that messes with them way it
worse than you saying, yes,

929
00:55:03,121 --> 00:55:06,200
I'm mad at you and you hurt me
and you piss me off or whatever.

930
00:55:06,201 --> 00:55:08,610
Playing all these games. No
Bruh. I learned it from me, Bro.

931
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:14,700
Check. Nonetheless. Good advice right
there. Good advice. Next question.

932
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:17,820
When you've crushed your daily to do list,

933
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:22,050
do you then take the time to relax
or do you attack the next day's list?

934
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:27,360
Is that against prioritize and execute
since the mission is done for the day,

935
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:32,120
you know, just do more. Just keep
going. Even if it's on the next day,

936
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:36,710
keep going, do more. If you
have extra time, do whatever
you can do to stay ahead.

937
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,820
And I do that pretty much
until I'm brain dead. And I,

938
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:42,470
I w I can definitely work myself
into until I'm brain dead.

939
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,080
Like I can get to a point where I'm
reading and I'm writing and it's just,

940
00:55:45,081 --> 00:55:46,940
it's just, uh, it's just done. I'm done.

941
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:50,480
And so I just have to stop and take
a break and then I'll go do something

942
00:55:50,481 --> 00:55:54,560
mindless for awhile, you know? So,
you know, if you forgot stuff to do,

943
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:58,280
keep hammering until you can't hammer
anymore and then say, oh, okay,

944
00:55:58,281 --> 00:55:59,114
you know what?

945
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:02,660
I need a little breather and then take a
little breather and they get back to it.

946
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:07,490
Right now I could work 24 hours a day,
24 hours a day,

947
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:11,780
seven days a week, 365 days a year, and,

948
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,060
and I wouldn't be able to get done
the things I'm trying to get done.

949
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:17,030
So it's not like I'm sitting there
going, oh cool. I got a break. No,

950
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:21,650
I can see it's all he's got is more stuff
to do. Gotcha. You got things to do.

951
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,160
So not a bunch of,
uh,

952
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,440
Boise call, it breaks and
it relaxing. This is not a,

953
00:56:26,441 --> 00:56:30,880
not a lot of that happening right now.
Now you go surfing. Is that a break?

954
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:33,790
Kind of. It's like a big break. Well,
it's kind of hard of the process.

955
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,910
It's like if you're doing
five sets of 10 on the bench,

956
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:43,430
what are you going to do? One set of 50
no, you do five sets of 10 so first at 10,

957
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,820
what do you do? You get a rescue
to recover. That's what surfing is.

958
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:49,210
That's it's the rest between sets.
That's all that is right there you go.

959
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:53,500
Was part of the process check.
But what would you,

960
00:56:53,501 --> 00:56:57,790
would you recommend for someone who's
like a normal person? Do what? You can.

961
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:01,810
Knock it out. Build up extra free time
if you need a break. Take a break.

962
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,340
Gotcha. That's pretty crazy, right.

963
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,400
Know what I'm saying is I get to bring
what you can. If you need a break,

964
00:57:09,401 --> 00:57:12,340
take a break. If you knew a little
relaxation takes some relaxation. Yeah.

965
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,580
Don't waste your time though. See,
people, people do relaxing, but they do.

966
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,940
They don't even do it. Good alien
feel relaxed when they get done.

967
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:21,310
It's not productive. Relaxing.
Yeah, they're, they just,

968
00:57:21,311 --> 00:57:24,430
what they did is they did
something stupid for an hour.

969
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:29,260
They watched youtube videos for an hour,
but I did that help, you know, go outside,

970
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:33,220
go for a run, do some burpees, go
surfing, go do some Jujitsu. Uh,

971
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:36,820
play with your kids, whatever. Do
something that actually has some value,

972
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:40,870
the real value. Uh, but
till what about, you know,

973
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:44,530
Pahata and we're going to, uh, the bar.

974
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:47,860
Yeah,
that's not great,

975
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:50,350
but sometimes don't get too hammered
because you're hung over the next day.

976
00:57:50,351 --> 00:57:54,550
You can't account, you know,
you can't function as good,
boom. Can't, uh, your output,

977
00:57:54,551 --> 00:57:57,940
your productivity comes down next day.
Better tell everyone what pal Honda means.

978
00:57:57,970 --> 00:57:59,740
Cause not everyone knows like old Hannah.

979
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:04,990
I guess technically it means done with
what you're doing. Power means done.

980
00:58:04,991 --> 00:58:09,010
Honda means like do. Yeah. Uh, but yeah,

981
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,060
Paul Hanna Po Finish what you're doing.
Tip.

982
00:58:11,061 --> 00:58:13,250
It's referred to when you're
finished with work. Yeah.

983
00:58:13,251 --> 00:58:18,180
That's the way I would use it. Yeah.
When you finish work, Pau Hana goes good.

984
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:18,940
You know,

985
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:22,510
whenever it's like Miller time and
for Kinda the same thing a little bit.

986
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:26,340
Next question,
would you recommend you get too far?

987
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:30,070
55 year old female with no
former martial arts background.

988
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:35,200
Is the risk for injury to high? Answered
this one a bunch of times. Hey, yes,

989
00:58:35,201 --> 00:58:37,780
you should do Jujitsu.
Pick good training partners.

990
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:42,190
Get your ego out of the picture and go
very slow and learn the techniques and

991
00:58:42,191 --> 00:58:46,840
you'll get something out of it.
Watch out for sparring. Rolling live.

992
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:50,590
You need to be really careful and you
need to really select good training

993
00:58:50,591 --> 00:58:53,020
partners that are very much
more experienced than you are.

994
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:56,950
Don't roll with white belts. If you're
a 55, don't even roll with blue belts.

995
00:58:56,951 --> 00:59:00,790
If you can help it as a 55 year old,
unless they're small and smart,

996
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:05,410
just be careful. But yeah, it's a great
trade. It's a great thing. What about, um,

997
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:09,730
cause I actually got asked this
online and I was actually through dms,

998
00:59:09,731 --> 00:59:13,870
like going through his, a girl, her last
name is Taylor, if I'm not mistaken,

999
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:18,430
we got a first name anyway, she's
a black belt and she, uh, you know,

1000
00:59:18,431 --> 00:59:22,130
when it comes to girls rolling, just even
just regular girls or whatever, let's

1001
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,510
face it.
I mean in training,

1002
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:27,980
they do have a bigger kind of kind of
obstacle in that way where they're at,

1003
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:32,190
they are at a higher risk of injury
more times because everyone, if,

1004
00:59:32,191 --> 00:59:33,890
if the rolling with the guys,
I mean everyone,

1005
00:59:33,891 --> 00:59:37,480
chances are everyone's bigger than them
and they might be going hard and they'd,

1006
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:40,790
you know, some guys especially early
on and they don't realize that Dang,

1007
00:59:40,791 --> 00:59:43,250
they're putting a lot of
strength and you know,

1008
00:59:43,251 --> 00:59:45,140
all this stuff into these
moves and you can live in

1009
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:51,320
Morocco and hard. Yeah. They don't even
realize it. Exactly. You're exhausted,

1010
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:53,583
relaxed,
knew

1011
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,190
exactly where they do have this obstacle.

1012
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:03,950
Even 55 year old a lady or even
just an older person in general.

1013
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:07,530
Um, they do have that added obstacle
where yet you do have to kind of, yeah.

1014
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:11,480
So what's the question? Yeah. The
question is like what do those people do?

1015
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:16,130
Same deal. Yeah. No, they do. They
have to be more extreme cautious.

1016
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,890
They have to take more caution.
Okay. You're 100% right.

1017
01:00:18,891 --> 01:00:21,860
What you're saying is right.
You do what I just said.

1018
01:00:21,861 --> 01:00:23,900
You don't want to go
with a psycho white belt,

1019
01:00:23,901 --> 01:00:26,990
you don't even want to go with any
white belt, right. Cause they're there.

1020
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:30,800
They don't know what they're doing.
So go with someone that's a purple belt.

1021
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:35,000
Someone that's relaxed, they're a 55
year old woman is gonna be on a different

1022
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:40,310
pace down the path. We're going to be on
the path, which is at a different pace.

1023
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:43,840
And the stress is too,
I would focus on the,

1024
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:47,200
the learning of the technique a lot more.
You know,

1025
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:51,290
it's been a lot more time drilling
and learning the technique and then

1026
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:54,680
occasionally with your
black belt instructor, with
your Brown belt instructor,

1027
01:00:54,681 --> 01:00:58,370
with some of the high level
purple belt smart people,

1028
01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:01,520
you do a nice little roll with them,
you have some fun, you see what works,

1029
01:01:01,521 --> 01:01:04,220
what doesn't work. You learn a
little bit more. Take that path,

1030
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:06,740
take that pace down
the path. Right? Right.

1031
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:10,690
Don't go in there with a big ego
and know what happens every time.

1032
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:14,240
Like if you introduce Jujitsu to people,

1033
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:18,740
they think that they have the
solution to something that you teach.

1034
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:22,490
And it's like, no, you don't
actually have the solution.

1035
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:27,020
You are don't know anything.
So just just don't do that.

1036
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,910
Is that the monster?
And you know,

1037
01:01:28,911 --> 01:01:31,520
we teach Jiu Jitsu for the first time to
a bunch of people and we were teaching

1038
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,790
the MPAA, right? The escape,

1039
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:37,370
the show escape where you roll
the person over from the mouth.

1040
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:42,650
And this one guy, you know, he's like,
I'm teaching what screen? This one guy,

1041
01:01:42,651 --> 01:01:45,110
he's like, I look, this doesn't work.

1042
01:01:45,111 --> 01:01:47,840
And he's got his weight all the way and
the other side and he's got his leg up.

1043
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:50,960
I remember that. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm like,
um, I'm like, yeah, there's another move.

1044
01:01:50,961 --> 01:01:52,960
You just do this popup and now
you're in the guard. And then,

1045
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:57,770
but like in his mind, like Jujitsu, just
us, wasn't it? What does and doesn't work.

1046
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:00,340
I don't know what this crap
is that Jocko was all into,

1047
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:04,190
but obviously it doesn't work.
It's like, no, actually it works.

1048
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,640
So you don't,

1049
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:10,490
you don't uncover the magic of
Jujitsu in one moment, you know?

1050
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:11,910
Yeah.

1051
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:13,720
Oh, actually, you know what?
I do remember the question.

1052
01:02:13,721 --> 01:02:16,880
So you know how it lit can fit five
year old women a role with you know,

1053
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:20,190
high level people, people that you
trust, people who have a lot of control

1054
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:24,990
over the, over the situation. What
about like, let's say I, you know,

1055
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:26,670
I'm a 55 year old woman.
I have a twin sister,

1056
01:02:26,671 --> 01:02:28,740
she's 55 we're in the
same shape kind of thing.

1057
01:02:28,741 --> 01:02:33,480
Just normal people and can we roll?
You better be careful.

1058
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:37,710
You better calm down. You better knock
it, competitive. You better relax.

1059
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:41,660
Now one thing that's good is I
would say yes actually. Yeah,

1060
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:45,870
I would say you know why?
Because you're around equivalent strength.

1061
01:02:45,871 --> 01:02:47,430
You're around equivalent knowledge.

1062
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:51,090
You still got to be careful that you
would prefer you go a couple of six months

1063
01:02:51,091 --> 01:02:51,924
before,

1064
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:56,790
before you jump in and do a death match
with your twin sister at age 55 I know

1065
01:02:56,791 --> 01:03:01,500
you, you've been competing each other.
So just, just try and relax. You know,

1066
01:03:01,501 --> 01:03:05,190
I used to say jade trying to
kill you. Like dude, come on.

1067
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:10,260
When jade used to train, no sorry.
Sure he could check. No, I know,

1068
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:14,130
that's what I'm saying. He tried.
It's funny to g even from birth,

1069
01:03:14,131 --> 01:03:17,550
jade was a little bit bigger
than me. Not Anymore. No, no, no.

1070
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:21,310
And I think it's literally a direct
result of it. Of always been little bits,

1071
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:25,280
Molly and complex. Yeah. Like
a little small mini micro.

1072
01:03:25,281 --> 01:03:27,810
A bit bigger than this dude.
And you know when that happened,

1073
01:03:27,811 --> 01:03:29,520
he was bigger than me through high school,

1074
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:35,120
through even through college who had
bigger than me until we were done kind of

1075
01:03:36,031 --> 01:03:38,070
with college,
just come on lift.

1076
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:42,780
And I ballooned up to like almost
to 50 to 50 and then he was like,

1077
01:03:42,781 --> 01:03:45,960
were you athletic when you were
to 50? Yeah, surprisingly. Yeah.

1078
01:03:45,961 --> 01:03:50,530
Not what you got to go back up there
again and wasn't as athletic, you know,

1079
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:55,850
a grown adult. It doesn't make
sense for me. I'm not tall. I Dunno.

1080
01:03:55,890 --> 01:04:00,580
This is my opinion. And plus in Hawaii,
lean to 50 not as lean as I am now.

1081
01:04:00,581 --> 01:04:04,590
No,
I wouldn't call myself lead or cut,

1082
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:06,300
but I wasn't fat though.
That's the thing.

1083
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:09,780
I even have this old picture of me and
my friend Scott Lewis, he's a cop now,

1084
01:04:09,781 --> 01:04:13,240
by the way. He, uh, we're, we're
like, cause he would lift it.

1085
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:17,080
He was my listing partner.
Oh yeah. Big Time. And um,

1086
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:18,511
we were like,

1087
01:04:18,511 --> 01:04:21,900
this is what I was like two 45 he was
like maybe two 30 or something like that.

1088
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:25,440
And yeah, it was big. But I
was like, dude, I was like
surprisingly defined though.

1089
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:27,150
I got 51 time

1090
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:33,180
and then I went and ran a four mile
run and I did not feel good. Yeah.

1091
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:35,370
And I was like, okay,
I'm done with this. Yes.

1092
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,620
I was pumped to be to
50 just cause you know,

1093
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:42,480
that time I did a four mile run and I
was like, good God, this is horrible.

1094
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:45,840
I can't do my job. And that's
the answer. That's the answer.

1095
01:04:45,841 --> 01:04:48,960
Why you don't want to be
two 50 and even being like,

1096
01:04:48,961 --> 01:04:52,440
that's a huge amount of weight even
health wise, especially as you get older,

1097
01:04:52,441 --> 01:04:56,690
whatever, like to be just rolling
around two 50 you know? Yeah.

1098
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:59,630
Yeah. And if you can't do a
four mile run, if you can't do,

1099
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:04,290
I probably thinking back like even a one
mile run would have been kind of kind

1100
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:09,291
of more difficult that would've
liked at two 55 was not a good sign.

1101
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:14,690
Yeah. That's uh, that's
how it went. Well, so yeah,

1102
01:05:14,691 --> 01:05:18,760
that's the point there being a,
I got bigger then jade boom.

1103
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:24,060
And with that little micro Napoleon
complex it crew like I was more like

1104
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:29,221
aggressive or am even still not like
more like I'll take up more aggressive.

1105
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:33,390
Like I started, he didn't even consider
Jesus as I started. You just go Charles

1106
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:39,850
more aggressive. That's funny cause I
don't figure it that way. You think Jason?

1107
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:41,500
I think Jade's more aggressive.

1108
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:44,820
Maybe like to get in like a
debate or something like yeah,

1109
01:05:44,830 --> 01:05:49,420
he's definitely addressing
a hundred percent. But uh,
but yeah, physical activity.

1110
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:51,930
I probably started to Dj. I was
like, before jade started, I was up,

1111
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:56,890
I was like well into purple belt before
Gevins started and that's such a big

1112
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:01,030
gap. So yeah, Jake and tried to kill me.
He will not kill me. Just simply won't.

1113
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:04,630
It's almost impossible. It's pretty much
impossible. Technically in impossible.

1114
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:08,380
There's uh, so if you
go a percentage, right?

1115
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,420
Chance of him ever beating me,

1116
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:15,750
the percent of the percent chance of him
beating me is closer to zero than it is

1117
01:06:15,851 --> 01:06:18,850
1% true.
That's how it is right now.

1118
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:21,500
Unless you went on a complete warpath.
Oh,

1119
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:25,320
what do you mean if he trained training
boy, yeah, that goes for every,

1120
01:06:25,321 --> 01:06:29,730
but currently that's how it is.
So He's 0%.

1121
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:31,480
He's off the path,
doesn't he met her?

1122
01:06:31,481 --> 01:06:35,770
He can get on the path still 0% chance.
Next question.

1123
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:39,400
I'd like to hear your thoughts on people
entering the military in their thirties

1124
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,570
I'm sure you saw it. How did
they fare? I don't remember.

1125
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:47,350
Military at an older age is fine. You
got maturity, you've got experience,

1126
01:06:47,351 --> 01:06:49,750
you've got intelligence,
and so that's good.

1127
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:52,840
You're going to bring a lot to the
table. However, you also have maturity,

1128
01:06:52,841 --> 01:06:54,100
experience and intelligence.

1129
01:06:54,101 --> 01:06:57,790
So the only downfall of it is you got
to do some dumb stuff when you're in the

1130
01:06:57,791 --> 01:06:59,100
military and,
and,

1131
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:04,110
and if you're older and you see how dumb
some of the stuff that you're doing is,

1132
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:06,160
you're,
it's going to be harder for you to do it.

1133
01:07:06,161 --> 01:07:09,190
You're going to have a little bit of
a negative attitude on if you allow

1134
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:12,280
yourself, it'd be easy to do. I
should say that if you allow yourself,

1135
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:15,100
it'd be easy to develop a negative
attitude about that stuff.

1136
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:18,940
I joined when I was 18 years old.
I didn't care.

1137
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:21,460
You want me to do whatever
you want me to do? I'll do it.

1138
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:23,620
I didn't see the stupidity
and a lot of this stuff.

1139
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:26,920
And so I think that's the only drawback
because you'll just be looking at some

1140
01:07:26,921 --> 01:07:28,330
of the stuff that you do in
the military thinking, oh,

1141
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:31,000
this is a much more efficient way to do
this. And if you let that get to you,

1142
01:07:31,001 --> 01:07:34,930
it's going to be problematic. So going
there with an open mind, do the crap,

1143
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:40,380
the tedious and kind of mindless stuff
that you got to do and push through that

1144
01:07:40,421 --> 01:07:42,700
and then you'll get to a position of
leadership and you can do your best to

1145
01:07:42,701 --> 01:07:44,740
mitigate that and take care
of other soldiers, sailors,

1146
01:07:44,741 --> 01:07:49,240
airmen and Marines while you're out
there serving the country. So yeah,

1147
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:52,480
it's awesome. It's great.
You'll, you'll be a big benefit.

1148
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:58,210
Do you think that that even that,
um, how you were saying like,

1149
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,140
okay, you'll, you'll,

1150
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:02,470
you kind of look at things in more of an
adult way kind of thing where it's like,

1151
01:08:02,471 --> 01:08:03,690
well, there's a more
efficient way to do something.

1152
01:08:03,691 --> 01:08:07,400
What do you think that that mindset would
kind of keep you from, uh, you know,

1153
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:12,250
being more cohesive to with if you allow
it to. It definitely will. If you, if you,

1154
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:14,860
that's why I said, do you have to
allow, if you just go look, this is,

1155
01:08:14,861 --> 01:08:16,100
this is the way it is right now.

1156
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:18,920
I'm a, I'm a, yeah.
[inaudible] in the military.

1157
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:22,010
They're telling me to do this thing.
It doesn't make any sense right now.

1158
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:26,540
I'm going to do it to the best of my
ability and move forward. If you say, Oh,

1159
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:29,020
this is stupid and you spread the
negativity of the other guys who go,

1160
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:31,130
why are we doing this? Students,
yeah, it's going to be problematic.

1161
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,600
And some go in there,
have a good attitude.

1162
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,450
You can promote really quickly if
you're squared away like that, you know?

1163
01:08:35,451 --> 01:08:37,640
So you got a good opportunity.
How do you, I mean it's,

1164
01:08:37,730 --> 01:08:41,030
I think it's totally good to go. What
about even like socially, you know,

1165
01:08:41,031 --> 01:08:45,920
like kind of like, oh these kids
are 18 you've been out in the world,

1166
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:48,920
you've had a job, you probably
have a house, you might
have kids. These kids are,

1167
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:53,840
I was out of high school. Like, you know
what I mean? It's, you're not there yet.

1168
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:57,200
You're,
and you think about what,

1169
01:08:57,201 --> 01:09:00,020
you know when you're that age
compared to what, when you're,

1170
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:03,530
when you're 30 you know, my big thing is
I tell my kids all the time, you know,

1171
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:08,810
or like my oldest daughter who's in
college and whatnot, and I'm always like,

1172
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:11,210
when I was your age, I was and
my first seal platoon, you know,

1173
01:09:11,211 --> 01:09:16,070
like you just can't even compete with
what I was doing with the responsibility

1174
01:09:16,071 --> 01:09:18,860
that I had when I was 18 years
old. You know, all that stuff.

1175
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:23,990
But the truth is when you're 18 you're
not as mature as you are when you're 30

1176
01:09:23,991 --> 01:09:27,650
so yeah, there'll be a social disconnect.
Like I went to college when I was,

1177
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:31,550
I think I was 28 or 29 or 30 and so yeah,

1178
01:09:31,551 --> 01:09:33,740
I was around kids that
were 1819 years old.

1179
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:38,060
And I realized very quickly that, you
know, you'd meet some mature kids,

1180
01:09:38,061 --> 01:09:40,460
but a lot of kids were just, they
were just young, you know? I mean,

1181
01:09:40,461 --> 01:09:44,530
there's not a big difference between 18
and 15 for some people. Right. But yeah,

1182
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:48,050
it's true. You think about what you were
doing your f 15 years old, 16 years old.

1183
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:49,340
Like I joined the military.

1184
01:09:49,341 --> 01:09:52,430
So luckily I had some kind of
structure imposed upon me. Yeah.

1185
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:56,420
But you think about the kind of stuff
that you can do when you're 18 years old,

1186
01:09:56,450 --> 01:10:01,180
people do dumb, dumb, dumb
stuff. Yeah. You, you, you,

1187
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:04,640
you look back and you're
happy that you made it.

1188
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:08,660
Cause you do dumb dumb stuff.

1189
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,960
We were talking about wasting
your time on youtube videos.

1190
01:10:11,961 --> 01:10:13,880
Go waste your time on Youtube.

1191
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:19,320
Like just put in penal teenagers
doing dumb stuff and you'll,

1192
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:23,450
you'll say wow. And, and 50%
of the stuff that you see,

1193
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:28,220
you'll recognize like, oh yeah I remember
that. So yeah, don't do dumb stuff.

1194
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:31,610
And as a 30 year old in the military you
can help give some of that guidance to

1195
01:10:31,611 --> 01:10:34,610
people. So I think it's cool. Go for
it man. And kind of vice versa. Right?

1196
01:10:34,611 --> 01:10:37,760
Cause like if you're the 18 year old 19
year old guy, there's like, you know,

1197
01:10:37,950 --> 01:10:41,950
a hundred will however many other 1819
year old guys, you guys are cruising.

1198
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:45,460
Then here comes to this 30 year
old, you know, all levelheaded, Bro,

1199
01:10:45,461 --> 01:10:47,630
I can't relate to this day.
This gets kind of weird.

1200
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:50,870
The other thing is when you're 18 you
don't even know how much those 30 year

1201
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:51,970
olds just think.

1202
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:56,140
You actually think you know more than
looking at them like they're idiots.

1203
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,550
Why would you not,
you know,

1204
01:10:59,030 --> 01:11:03,500
swing off this rope and see if you can
get through the window on the third floor.

1205
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:06,390
Why would you not give you that
old and what exactly. Yeah,

1206
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,500
so that's something I would be out.
Brace yourself for that too.

1207
01:11:09,501 --> 01:11:12,640
Remember the perspective of an 18 year
old and they're not looking at you going,

1208
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:14,010
gosh,
I'd like to learn about how

1209
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:17,070
they're looking at you. Like, I can't
believe you joined the military.

1210
01:11:17,071 --> 01:11:21,920
What's wrong with you? Yeah,
hold man. There was, there
were guys who actually can,

1211
01:11:21,921 --> 01:11:24,340
they came from the military
and still eligible, right?

1212
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:29,360
For F four foot point in college and
when I was 26 when I was 27 and let's

1213
01:11:30,121 --> 01:11:33,990
think, let's face it, 26 27 that's a
Yo, that's a, you're physically like,

1214
01:11:33,991 --> 01:11:37,560
you're solid still. And we looked at
them, I was like, man, these are like,

1215
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:41,010
these are old school guys, these are
like old careful with them and practice.

1216
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:44,540
Literally it was like I felt like
that for one of the guys anyway.

1217
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,420
And then you go to class, right. And you
get these people who, you know, they,

1218
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,840
they don't go to college right after high
school. They go, you know, later on when,

1219
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:55,110
in my opinion when most of us should go,
when you know why you're going.

1220
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,820
And so this one lady was in my class,

1221
01:11:56,821 --> 01:12:01,800
she was maybe 35 maybe 36 whatever
and discussed all day long.

1222
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:06,150
No, she didn't look at me at all. She
freaking donor on program. Yeah. Yeah.

1223
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:09,150
Like I was no factor in her
life. She was doing, yeah.

1224
01:12:09,151 --> 01:12:13,260
Literally the correct way to do
it. She sat up front, you know,

1225
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:16,590
and she's asking questions.
Protocol. Literally.

1226
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:18,610
That's really the way to
go when you think about it.

1227
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:21,570
You don't even have to think about it.
That's the way to go. But nonetheless,

1228
01:12:21,571 --> 01:12:22,111
she like this,

1229
01:12:22,111 --> 01:12:25,860
but she's obviously 30 something years
old and it just didn't compute to me.

1230
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:29,470
You know, like I was like,
well, what's important thing?

1231
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:33,150
But that's a really key part of this
conversation is when you're eight,

1232
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:37,200
imagine as a 30 year old
when you're looking at that
18 year old, they don't see,

1233
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:42,510
I understand anything,
sir. Don't check. No Sir.

1234
01:12:42,511 --> 01:12:47,100
We don't want 18.
Next question.

1235
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:52,440
You've said everyone will know if you're
the one taking own ship and leading the

1236
01:12:52,441 --> 01:12:57,290
team in spite of having a poor leader
or someone who does everything for their

1237
01:12:57,291 --> 01:12:58,124
own glory,

1238
01:12:58,470 --> 01:13:03,000
but what do you do if your boss's boss
doesn't make the connection between your

1239
01:13:03,001 --> 01:13:07,290
work and the team's success?
Good.

1240
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:10,920
Good. You know what? I do? Keep
working hard. That's awesome.

1241
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:12,540
Make keep making your boss look good.

1242
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:16,410
I recommend that you put your ego in check
would be good to get that credit for.

1243
01:13:16,411 --> 01:13:19,810
For what? For what's happening.
You're looking for that glory. The,

1244
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:22,860
and they're the boss is doing
it for glory. Well guess what?

1245
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:25,680
That's making you mad cause you want
some of that glory. You know what?

1246
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:30,390
It'll come the two things about
this. Number one, let them have it.

1247
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:33,720
Make them look great. You're worried
that the boss's boss doesn't get it.

1248
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:38,490
It will come in due course.
Be patient, work hard.

1249
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:40,110
Give your boss the credit.

1250
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:44,050
Don't worry about it and in
due course it will come you.

1251
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:48,480
You can't fool the boss or the
boss's boss won't get fooled forever.

1252
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:51,150
They won't get fooled forever.
And you know what?

1253
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:54,840
Worst case scenario you get your bosses,
you get your boss promoted. Cool.

1254
01:13:55,230 --> 01:14:00,090
Now he trusts you. You worked hard for
him. You did good. He can take his role.

1255
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:04,650
It's okay. It's okay. This is very common.

1256
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:07,400
This is no strange question.
Yeah,

1257
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:10,963
no question.

1258
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:16,110
What do you do for fun when
you're not getting after it? I,

1259
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:19,810
this is kind of a weird question, right?
Why? Because you're always getting enough.

1260
01:14:19,811 --> 01:14:22,270
Well because his surfing getting after it.
Yeah,

1261
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:24,230
it is actually edges are
getting after it and yeah,

1262
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,160
it is getting after it is
playing guitar getting after it.

1263
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:31,810
Yes it is rock and roll band
getting after it. Yes it is. Okay.

1264
01:14:31,811 --> 01:14:35,800
I guess if I'm hanging with my kids,
is that getting after it?

1265
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:39,330
Sometimes I kind of, it turns what we're
doing because we were doing Jiu Jitsu.

1266
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:43,180
I don't know, um, what I do for
fun where I'm not getting after it.

1267
01:14:44,030 --> 01:14:46,720
Just stuff that I enjoy doing.
Like you said earlier,

1268
01:14:46,721 --> 01:14:49,630
like it doesn't take discipline
to go and do Jujitsu.

1269
01:14:49,631 --> 01:14:52,300
If did you just use really fun for you
and did you choose definitely fun for me

1270
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:57,220
too.
I would say 70% of the time I'm,

1271
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:01,990
I'm like super stoked to be going and
roll 30% of the time I don't feel like it.

1272
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:05,650
I go anyways, our sets
say 28% of the time. Sure.

1273
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:08,260
There's like 2% of the
time where I recognize,

1274
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:12,970
oh I'm going to get hurt today cause
I'm beat up or I'm tired or whatever.

1275
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:17,790
It's like, okay, you know what,
maybe I won't train today. Or,

1276
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:18,760
and even on those days,

1277
01:15:18,761 --> 01:15:22,620
sometimes I'll come in and I'll just
do a light role just to make sure,

1278
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:26,490
put myself a little discipline
check. So yeah, I don't know.

1279
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:30,490
That's the kind of the thing where I
guess from other people's perspective,

1280
01:15:30,491 --> 01:15:34,390
if they're thinking Jujitsu's not fun
and working out, it's not fun and, and,

1281
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:37,600
and practicing an instrument's not fun,

1282
01:15:37,601 --> 01:15:41,950
well then I'm not ever having any fun,
but actually the opposite is true.

1283
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,770
All those things are fun for me, so I'm
having fun all the time. There you go.

1284
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:50,440
Yeah. It kind of kind of goes in line with
that other question. Enlightened lists.

1285
01:15:50,441 --> 01:15:55,180
Like, do you ever do mindless stuff? So
maybe that's kind of the work yard work,

1286
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:59,380
cleaning the garage, stuff like
that. But you know, actually,

1287
01:15:59,381 --> 01:16:02,680
you know what it is now that I think
of it, it's the, the question could be,

1288
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:06,520
could be, do you, what do you
do fund? Meaning what do you do?

1289
01:16:06,521 --> 01:16:10,990
Like mindless stuff that's um,
that's not technically productive.

1290
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:16,000
So you say turf surfing. Oh, perfect.
Is Not technically per productive.

1291
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,340
I don't know though. So it's one of
those things where like, you know what,

1292
01:16:18,341 --> 01:16:20,530
you feel good when you get out of the
water. I mean you get a little workout.

1293
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:23,770
It is because you get better at
surfing. Yeah. So it is kind of product,

1294
01:16:23,771 --> 01:16:26,230
but there's no, there's no
productivity to surfing. There's no,

1295
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:31,630
there's no ultimate goal other than the
doing it itself. Same thing with guitar,

1296
01:16:31,631 --> 01:16:35,650
but you're getting better at guitar.
So like even like yard work for example,

1297
01:16:35,651 --> 01:16:40,600
it's like sure, that's fine. Yeah.
That's productive. You're improved,

1298
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:41,470
it's productive.

1299
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:44,980
It's like what you're asking me is what
do I do that's completely unproductive.

1300
01:16:44,981 --> 01:16:45,970
Productive.
Yeah.

1301
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,100
I Dunno right now there's not a lot,
hardest question in the world.

1302
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:58,300
There's not a lot of things right now
that I'm doing that aren't somehow

1303
01:16:58,301 --> 01:17:00,440
productive I think.
But anyways,

1304
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,980
because the technique I'll phone though
because that was the actual question.

1305
01:17:03,010 --> 01:17:05,790
You're just trying to yeah.
I'm all assuming

1306
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:10,430
that you, you know,
cause watching youtube,

1307
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:13,940
back to the other question, watching
youtube videos of like he ever, uh,

1308
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:18,020
like Trey go on youtube actually don't
do it. But if you do do it, do this.

1309
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:22,940
Go in the search in youtube,
go drunk, girl fails.

1310
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,580
Okay. That's what it's called.
Trump girl fails. Okay.

1311
01:17:25,581 --> 01:17:30,581
So there's probably maybe 500,000 to
10 million of these videos potentially.

1312
01:17:31,161 --> 01:17:35,630
That's my estimate. So what that
means is once you're done with one,

1313
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:39,500
the other one's coming. And here's
the thing, it never gets old.

1314
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:43,870
So that is, I do think it gets
old. All right. Well, I mean, yeah,

1315
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:47,180
that was more of like a, what you call the
exaggeration. But it takes a long time.

1316
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:52,220
I would argue for certain, for most of
us, for it to quote unquote get old.

1317
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:57,110
So the point there is that is something
that is straight up, not productive.

1318
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:58,910
Sure.
You can learn a lesson.

1319
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:03,590
The lessons to be learned from those
videos get learned literally the first

1320
01:18:03,591 --> 01:18:07,340
video who literally, and then they
don't get learned in the first video.

1321
01:18:07,341 --> 01:18:09,890
Because the first one just seems
like it could be an anomaly.

1322
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,990
It's like when you tap them for
someone that's never done it before,

1323
01:18:11,991 --> 01:18:15,070
it takes like three or four before
I go get it. You're right. The,

1324
01:18:15,071 --> 01:18:15,950
you know something.
I don't know.

1325
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:20,690
So you gotta watch three to five
drunk girl fail videos with your,

1326
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:22,840
you know,
16 year old daughter and say like,

1327
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:26,840
this is why you don't get drunk.

1328
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:29,750
This is why. Yeah, actually
you don't believe me. Okay,

1329
01:18:29,751 --> 01:18:33,110
we'll watch two more and we'll see if
there's any of these things that you would

1330
01:18:33,111 --> 01:18:36,030
want to see yourself
behaving gas. Yeah, but,

1331
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:38,990
and you could argue that maybe
if you watch five, six, seven,

1332
01:18:38,991 --> 01:18:43,991
10 20 you start to see another pattern
get revealed within the pattern of drunk

1333
01:18:44,931 --> 01:18:48,170
girl fails. So one of them is, you know,

1334
01:18:48,171 --> 01:18:52,470
a girl riding a scooter down
this path so you're not,

1335
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:56,080
not like not just don't get drunk but
don't ride scooters. Exactly. Right.

1336
01:18:56,300 --> 01:19:00,830
Exactly right. We see dance on the
bar when drunk. Yes, exactly. Right.

1337
01:19:00,831 --> 01:19:05,510
So if you see, let's say within the
span of 15 drunk girl fail videos,

1338
01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:07,530
you see,
you know,

1339
01:19:08,150 --> 01:19:13,150
30 of those is girls dancing on the bar
versus only two of them were girls on a

1340
01:19:15,021 --> 01:19:15,770
scooter.

1341
01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:20,770
You can kind of discern that
dancing on the bar statistically,

1342
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:25,260
right today is a little bit more
dangerous. I'm just saying, hey,

1343
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:29,240
we're digging for lessons that will
all that. So that's a bad thing.

1344
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:31,980
This in digging for lessons as a bad
thing. That's what you're saying.

1345
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:36,770
That wasn't a lesson, Bro. Sorry,
digging for lessons. Next question.

1346
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:44,150
Virtuosity requires your favorite subject.
Discipline.

1347
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,370
Creativity is important as well.

1348
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:50,330
Does a single focus on
discipline inhibit creativity?

1349
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:55,850
No.
Jimmy page.

1350
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:01,530
Next question. Seriously.
Jimmy page. What? Okay.

1351
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:01,910
All right.

1352
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:06,910
Well you're a bitch led Zepplin Guitar
Virtuoso practiced with discipline.

1353
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,340
I just answered this on the
kids who were podcast. Okay.

1354
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:16,820
Because Jimmy Page played guitar so much
when he was in school that they had to

1355
01:20:17,311 --> 01:20:22,200
take his guitar from him during like
study halls during lunch. Like, no,

1356
01:20:22,201 --> 01:20:25,140
you can't just sit there and play guitar.
You need to do other things.

1357
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:28,800
That's how much he practiced.
Yeah. He practiced so much.

1358
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:34,160
He became such a such a skilled player
through that much discipline that he was

1359
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:40,760
able to get more creative than
almost anyone else on the guitar.

1360
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,350
So there you go. It doesn't
give you freedom. It,

1361
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:47,350
it expands your creativity.
Yeah,

1362
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:53,100
and Jimmy page is one example of a
multitude. So let me ask you this.

1363
01:20:53,101 --> 01:20:54,810
I guess we kind of talked
about but not really.

1364
01:20:54,811 --> 01:20:58,800
I've never actually asked you
that. I can remember. So if you,

1365
01:20:58,870 --> 01:21:00,780
and let's assume that Jimmy page,

1366
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:04,480
he didn't do it because he
felt like this is, you know,

1367
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:07,800
what I should be doing right now,
whatever he did just cause I'm addicted.

1368
01:21:07,801 --> 01:21:08,880
Tick Guitar,
I love it.

1369
01:21:09,150 --> 01:21:13,110
And there's nothing I'd rather be
doing and all this stuff. So if you,

1370
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:13,711
the question is,

1371
01:21:13,711 --> 01:21:17,970
if you just love doing it and
that's why you're doing it so much.

1372
01:21:18,330 --> 01:21:23,310
I Love Guitar. I don't want to eat
dinner. It now I'm busy on my guitar,

1373
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:27,810
you know, enjoy myself and learning and
just loving it every single moment of it.

1374
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:32,010
I don't want to go surf. I'm on
my guitar. Boom every single day.

1375
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:33,420
Is that discipline

1376
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:38,593
okay?

1377
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:49,200
Yes.
Yeah,

1378
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:55,780
because let's say, okay.
Actually, I don't know.

1379
01:21:56,380 --> 01:22:00,580
I guess not technically.
Yeah, it is. It is,

1380
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:02,690
it is.
But I,

1381
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:08,100
I'd be hard pressed to find somebody
that loves doing something so much that

1382
01:22:09,611 --> 01:22:13,960
they do it all the time with no
discipline whatsoever. Yeah. TheN in, uh,

1383
01:22:14,650 --> 01:22:16,060
I think I agree with you there.

1384
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:20,470
But technically is that discipline though
cause you know, take Michael Jordan,

1385
01:22:20,471 --> 01:22:24,260
right? For example. It's not a good
example for what I'm about to say.

1386
01:22:24,261 --> 01:22:28,450
I think the guitar examples good cause
if you really love doing it and that's

1387
01:22:28,451 --> 01:22:32,110
what you're doing, I'll tell you what,
it takes discipline even if you enjoy it.

1388
01:22:32,650 --> 01:22:34,540
Yeah. I'm going to stick
with that answer for now.

1389
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:37,060
So let's say you don't want to
and even more important answers.

1390
01:22:37,061 --> 01:22:40,030
I don't think it matters. I don't think
it matters either. So I don't want really,

1391
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:43,330
because it's like it's because it
kind of alter at the end of the game.

1392
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:47,320
It did you put in the hours of practice
and did you get good at it? Okay.

1393
01:22:47,321 --> 01:22:49,350
Did you get good at it?
That's what the question is.

1394
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:53,650
Did you get good at this thing? Usually
I'll take him all the time. Pretty much.

1395
01:22:53,651 --> 01:22:58,150
With very few exceptions. The way you get
good at something is practice. And then,

1396
01:22:58,570 --> 01:22:59,403
you know,

1397
01:22:59,410 --> 01:23:03,970
usually since you can't do one thing
all day every single day for you know,

1398
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,120
30 40 50 it's going to take discipline.

1399
01:23:07,121 --> 01:23:09,380
Meaning you're going to have to do it
even though you don't want to do it kind

1400
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:12,400
of thing,
which is part of what discipline is.

1401
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:16,750
But what if that part of it doesn't,
isn't there,

1402
01:23:16,770 --> 01:23:19,720
cause even like Michael Jordan and
he's so good and he's probably loved

1403
01:23:19,721 --> 01:23:20,351
basketball,
whatever,

1404
01:23:20,351 --> 01:23:23,670
but they're ha there was of course days
where he's like okay I'd rather maybe be

1405
01:23:23,870 --> 01:23:27,790
hanging out, I'm going to take
display. Right, right, right.

1406
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:32,791
But that was a real person cause cause
to get a person that loves something so

1407
01:23:33,221 --> 01:23:36,850
much that it took them zero discipline,
I don't think that's a realistic person.

1408
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:40,000
I think that anyone that does anything,

1409
01:23:40,770 --> 01:23:44,890
it gets to a point where the only
thing that drives him to do that extra

1410
01:23:44,891 --> 01:23:48,340
percentage is disciplined. So I
guess I will stick with it. Yeah.

1411
01:23:48,341 --> 01:23:52,690
So I guess the question, if you want to
kind of relate it to like a real person,

1412
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:56,650
so you don't,
a person who again just like loves it,

1413
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,210
he just loves what they do.

1414
01:23:58,211 --> 01:24:00,190
Of course they're going to have thumb
discipline because they're going to have

1415
01:24:00,191 --> 01:24:04,030
some days that they don't love
it or whatever. Like are they,

1416
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:08,550
would you consider them a discipline
person in their, in their field? Yeah,

1417
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:11,190
but we've also talked about this before,

1418
01:24:11,210 --> 01:24:14,260
just people that are very disciplined in
one field and completely on discipline

1419
01:24:14,261 --> 01:24:15,880
and other fields. Yeah. So,

1420
01:24:15,881 --> 01:24:20,290
so it's kind of an indicator that
that might not really be technically

1421
01:24:20,291 --> 01:24:24,950
discipline.
Technically they got the practice hours,

1422
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:28,630
you work, if you like it, that's
great. If you don't like it,

1423
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:30,510
well here's appears on indicator.
If you,

1424
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:35,290
if you don't like doing it or what are
you doing it for if you don't even enjoy

1425
01:24:35,291 --> 01:24:39,080
it.
I mean the end right to the,

1426
01:24:39,130 --> 01:24:41,170
to the end or whatever it means to an end.

1427
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:45,040
But if you're going to dedicate level 12
to something that you don't even enjoy,

1428
01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:48,210
I think I did, that's kind of
problematic. I think you're right too.

1429
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:54,040
Next question. When you realize that
nothing will change in the leadership,

1430
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:58,930
do you tap out and move on or continue
trying to be a good leader to your crew

1431
01:24:58,990 --> 01:25:02,470
who deserves it?
That's definitely a question of that.

1432
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:09,170
It requires a little bit more information
to give a good answer too. You know,

1433
01:25:09,171 --> 01:25:10,670
because what's the situation?
Can you be,

1434
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:14,090
is there an opportunity that you could
become the leader longterm because that

1435
01:25:14,091 --> 01:25:16,070
totally changes the outlook,
right? If if you could,

1436
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:20,030
if you could do a good job and step up
and move them to a more senior leadership

1437
01:25:20,031 --> 01:25:24,740
position where you could take even more
turd turns or take even more care of the

1438
01:25:24,741 --> 01:25:28,160
crew will, then that's a positive thing
and it might be worth hanging out for.

1439
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:32,180
Also,
is it a complete dead end?

1440
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:36,920
Like is there no possibility it's a
family owned business and all the senior

1441
01:25:36,921 --> 01:25:39,410
leadership has related to the family
and you're not part of the family and

1442
01:25:39,411 --> 01:25:42,650
you're never have a chance
that that changes the prospect.

1443
01:25:42,651 --> 01:25:43,670
I mean obviously then it's like,
okay,

1444
01:25:43,671 --> 01:25:46,790
well maybe it's not worth sticking
around there. If you leave,

1445
01:25:46,791 --> 01:25:50,810
can you leave where you can give open
the opportunity for other people to go

1446
01:25:50,811 --> 01:25:55,610
where you're going? Right? Which is
not a good thing in terms of, you know,

1447
01:25:56,930 --> 01:25:59,510
you're not being very loyal,
you're being anti loyal,

1448
01:25:59,511 --> 01:26:02,720
you're being unloyal
disloyal if you do that.

1449
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:08,030
But if the leadership that you're working
for isn't taking care of the people,

1450
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:13,340
then you have to have some loyalty to the
people you work with. So there's that.

1451
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:17,230
Um, I think that you, you,

1452
01:26:17,231 --> 01:26:19,570
you have to assess everything that's
going on in this situation, which,

1453
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:24,890
which is not evident in this one
quick question. I would say this too,

1454
01:26:24,891 --> 01:26:27,230
like don't blind side your boss,
right?

1455
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:30,530
That's something that if you're
going to leave, leave on good terms,

1456
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:32,120
explained to him what's going on.
Also,

1457
01:26:32,121 --> 01:26:34,850
that can be an opportunity to start a
conversation about how the leadership

1458
01:26:34,851 --> 01:26:35,840
could include proof.

1459
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:38,780
A lot of times people don't want to
change anything until it really smacks him

1460
01:26:38,781 --> 01:26:41,100
in the face. And one of the things
that smacks him in the face is,

1461
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:44,660
is when one of their good people
comes in and says, Hey, look, I, I,

1462
01:26:44,870 --> 01:26:47,690
I'm going to leave because
of these reasons. And again,

1463
01:26:47,691 --> 01:26:51,650
you don't on the exit interview
or on those conversations,

1464
01:26:51,651 --> 01:26:55,070
you don't just drop dime and make
everyone make out to be this horrible

1465
01:26:55,071 --> 01:26:57,020
situation and say,
here's some things that I've noticed.

1466
01:26:57,021 --> 01:26:58,790
Here's some things that
I would want to change.

1467
01:26:58,791 --> 01:27:01,730
Here's the direction that I see the
company going and this is the direction I

1468
01:27:01,731 --> 01:27:05,060
think it should be going. And for these
reasons I've decided I'm going to go try,

1469
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:08,590
you know, try my hand somewhere else.
I think if you'd be open like that,

1470
01:27:08,591 --> 01:27:12,350
it can start some good conversations and
possibly you could make some progress

1471
01:27:13,190 --> 01:27:17,480
or possibly you could
confirm your suspicions,

1472
01:27:17,481 --> 01:27:20,150
which are no one wants to change.
No one wants to do anything different.

1473
01:27:20,151 --> 01:27:23,630
And if that's the case and you
realize it's a dead end for you, yeah,

1474
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:24,740
you've got to take that option.

1475
01:27:26,210 --> 01:27:29,410
You can't beat your head against
the wall on the 40, you know,

1476
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:32,300
you can beat your head against the wall
47 times on the 48th time. It's like,

1477
01:27:32,301 --> 01:27:36,200
okay, I need to do something
different. So pay attention to that.

1478
01:27:40,650 --> 01:27:41,570
Next question.

1479
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:48,040
What can we all learn from tenacious
d that most people overlook?

1480
01:27:49,210 --> 01:27:50,550
The critical question

1481
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:53,970
question, but there's actually a real,
a real legitimate answer to that.

1482
01:27:54,090 --> 01:27:57,530
And that is that tenacious
d who's, uh, a very, uh,

1483
01:27:57,690 --> 01:28:00,270
funny group of individuals.

1484
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:06,440
Jack Black is one of them who's a musician
and a comedian and an actor and Kyle

1485
01:28:07,441 --> 01:28:10,320
gas as the other member. What, what's,

1486
01:28:10,321 --> 01:28:12,300
what's great about them is they
don't take themselves too seriously.

1487
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:15,630
And I think that's the lesson to learn
is don't take yourself too seriously.

1488
01:28:15,930 --> 01:28:17,850
Have some fun and

1489
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:21,610
don't take yourself too seriously.
There it is.

1490
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:22,633
Yeah.

1491
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:27,560
And I would say there's a
difference between taking
yourself seriously and being

1492
01:28:27,561 --> 01:28:30,770
serious.
So you know how like

1493
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:36,480
being serious is like, okay, you're
not necessarily joking all the time,

1494
01:28:37,830 --> 01:28:39,960
but taking yourself too seriously is like,
you know,

1495
01:28:39,990 --> 01:28:44,130
if like a joke is made about you or you
can't laugh at yourself or is that kind

1496
01:28:44,131 --> 01:28:47,250
of stuff? Yeah, yeah. It's different.
So you can be serious all the time.

1497
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:51,660
You can be a serious person and not
take yourself to see that. That's true.

1498
01:28:52,170 --> 01:28:54,510
And that's a good,
that's fine. That's fine.

1499
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:57,210
The person who don't want to be as
the person that takes themselves too

1500
01:28:57,211 --> 01:29:00,270
seriously all the time, that's
a problem. So inversely,

1501
01:29:00,271 --> 01:29:05,220
I guess could you to like, could
you be a very nuts, serious person,

1502
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:07,860
but take yourself too seriously?

1503
01:29:09,810 --> 01:29:13,560
Could you be a very serious,
could you be a very like, jokey,

1504
01:29:13,561 --> 01:29:15,340
not serious person? Yeah, for sure.

1505
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:19,560
This the person that you can dish it
out but you can't take it thin skin type

1506
01:29:19,561 --> 01:29:24,480
guys. Yeah. Kind of like you
write a little bit. Yeah. Yeah.

1507
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:29,700
I see. I see what you did
there. I got a next question.

1508
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:34,080
Unless there's anything more
from tenacious D no. You know,

1509
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:38,460
maybe some good songs we can
inspirado right.

1510
01:29:38,461 --> 01:29:40,290
That's from tonight.
That's where he got that.

1511
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:43,470
I've got to give him a warning of
language is not appropriate for kids with

1512
01:29:43,471 --> 01:29:46,440
tenacious d. Ignore some of the subject
matter. So be careful with that.

1513
01:29:47,670 --> 01:29:49,440
The warning.
Next question.

1514
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:53,010
You mentioned you rarely
pay play closed guard.

1515
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:57,750
Rarely is this just a personal preference?

1516
01:29:58,410 --> 01:30:02,670
I would say that it is somewhat
a personal preference, right?

1517
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,810
Because there's definitely some people
that intentionally played closed guard.

1518
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:11,580
That's their game. Um,
but at the same time,

1519
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:14,100
in order to attack even
from the closed guard,

1520
01:30:14,101 --> 01:30:17,250
most of the time you have to open your
guard. So therefore your guard is open.

1521
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:20,490
So open guard and that's
kind of what I do.

1522
01:30:21,510 --> 01:30:23,640
Skip the step of opening my guard.

1523
01:30:23,890 --> 01:30:26,780
But you've been in people's guard that
have really good close guards. Yes. Yeah.

1524
01:30:26,850 --> 01:30:30,900
It's not fun. No. And that's why I try
not to let people close her guard. Yeah.

1525
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:35,340
Cause you can prevent that from happening.
Yeah. There's people that have really,

1526
01:30:35,341 --> 01:30:38,160
really solid psycho closed guard.

1527
01:30:38,161 --> 01:30:41,980
So I'm not anti closed guard and
some people are great at it. Uh,

1528
01:30:42,450 --> 01:30:46,800
my personal preferences to
play more open guard. Yeah.

1529
01:30:48,030 --> 01:30:49,710
Yeah. It's one of those
things were closed guard.

1530
01:30:49,711 --> 01:30:53,100
If you're not a person who always
plays closed guard or whatever,

1531
01:30:53,101 --> 01:30:57,570
it can be just something that you kind
of use for specific situations. You know,

1532
01:30:57,571 --> 01:30:59,550
like if you're trying to maybe breed

1533
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:03,900
regained some energy or something like
that, you want to rest a little bit.

1534
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:08,010
Or even in like a self defense,
like a striking scenario,

1535
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:11,120
like a closed garden. Mike, Mike
know the close guard, isn't it?

1536
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:16,180
There's no doubt that closed guard has
viable purpose and is good and I do use

1537
01:31:16,591 --> 01:31:19,110
it. I just don't use it a lot. Yeah. Yeah.

1538
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,660
And if you're a taller lanky guy,

1539
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:26,720
closed gardens might be a little
bit short fat legs that you know,

1540
01:31:27,510 --> 01:31:32,010
up. My closed guard is like my toes are
touching depending on the size of the

1541
01:31:32,011 --> 01:31:34,620
person.
And actually where it stems from,

1542
01:31:34,710 --> 01:31:37,800
if you went to the root of it
is it stems from foot locks.

1543
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:42,030
So if you close your guard, when your
guard opens, you're vulnerable in that.

1544
01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:44,820
There's a moment where
you're both vulnerable and
if you're training with guys

1545
01:31:44,821 --> 01:31:47,490
that have really good for locks,
that's not a good situation.

1546
01:31:47,491 --> 01:31:50,790
So that's where I started not closing
my guard because there was always that

1547
01:31:50,791 --> 01:31:55,170
transition period where my feet were
vulnerable so I just stopped closing my

1548
01:31:55,171 --> 01:31:59,620
garden, kept it open and move my fit feet
towards me to keep it little bit safer.

1549
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:04,570
Yeah. Next question. We've
got time for one more.

1550
01:32:05,650 --> 01:32:10,430
Yes. Yo Jocko. What's
the best way to increase

1551
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:17,690
Yo Jocko? What's the best way
to increase one's confidence?

1552
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:24,260
You want to increase
your confidence?

1553
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:28,070
I'll,
I'll tell you what I think what you do,

1554
01:32:28,190 --> 01:32:31,910
if you want to increase your
confidence is you do Jujitsu,

1555
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:35,960
you work out,
you get stronger,

1556
01:32:36,590 --> 01:32:40,970
you read and you study and
you learn and you get smarter

1557
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:43,623
and,

1558
01:32:44,370 --> 01:32:49,370
and then you practice speaking and you
practice speaking so that you can become

1559
01:32:49,871 --> 01:32:52,210
more articulate and then
you practice some more

1560
01:32:54,380 --> 01:32:57,860
and then you,
then you do hard things.

1561
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,170
Things that are challenging,

1562
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:05,450
things that are tough and then
you get tougher. You don't quit.

1563
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:12,830
That's what you do.
And then you stand up straight with your,

1564
01:33:13,010 --> 01:33:16,850
with your head high and your
chin up and your chest out.

1565
01:33:19,730 --> 01:33:23,630
And at the same time you also stay humble

1566
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:27,210
cause you don't know everything.

1567
01:33:28,470 --> 01:33:33,240
And there are people that are
better than you are at some things.

1568
01:33:33,510 --> 01:33:37,890
People that are smarter than you and
they're stronger than you and faster and

1569
01:33:37,891 --> 01:33:42,891
more athletic than you and they have
more money and they got better looks and

1570
01:33:43,261 --> 01:33:44,130
they're funnier.

1571
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:49,010
But all that is okay.

1572
01:33:51,290 --> 01:33:56,290
It's actually okay because there
are things that are more important,

1573
01:33:58,670 --> 01:34:02,660
more important than being
strong and smart and athletic.

1574
01:34:03,140 --> 01:34:04,730
More important than all of those things.

1575
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:11,880
Things like loyalty,
honor

1576
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:15,340
will,

1577
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:19,940
things like courage,

1578
01:34:22,750 --> 01:34:27,700
the courage to stand and
the will to keep going

1579
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:37,070
and to do the right things
for the right reasons.

1580
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:45,440
Yeah. And if you know, if
you know you won't give up

1581
01:34:48,430 --> 01:34:53,290
and you know you won't give in and
if you test yourself and you fail,

1582
01:34:53,410 --> 01:34:57,100
but you know you're going to get
back up again. If you know that,

1583
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:01,670
if you know that,

1584
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:09,350
then you know that your character
is strong and that's what matters.

1585
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:15,110
And that right there.

1586
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:18,643
Okay.

1587
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:21,650
Is all the confidence you need.

1588
01:35:26,410 --> 01:35:30,830
And I think that's
all I've got for tonight.

1589
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:37,040
So Echo. Yes. Speaking of
being stronger and faster.

1590
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:39,730
Yes. And doing Jujitsu. Sure.

1591
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:42,740
And learning and just
being on the path overall.

1592
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:48,650
Maybe you could give us some
information on how we can effectively,

1593
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:51,140
efficiently move down that path.
Yeah.

1594
01:35:52,610 --> 01:35:56,570
Support and support ourselves,
support ourselves and support others.

1595
01:35:56,630 --> 01:36:00,920
That's really ultimately really what it
is. Makes it intellectually supporting.

1596
01:36:01,010 --> 01:36:04,340
Yes.
So I will talk about our company,

1597
01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:09,890
little company in Maine
called origin origin main.com.

1598
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:14,750
This is where you can get Jocko
Super Krill oil is for your joints.

1599
01:36:14,810 --> 01:36:19,640
Omega Three's making three's have a
lotta benefits, valuable benefits,

1600
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:23,940
but the ones that I personally
have reaped,

1601
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:28,860
can you reap benefits? Benefits,
right? Just can't reap the foot.

1602
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:32,250
And Terry DGF. Yeah, yeah.
So watch out for that.

1603
01:36:32,310 --> 01:36:34,920
But if you are in the reaping mood,

1604
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:39,870
reap some benefits of Jocko Super Krill
oil by way of your joints being healthy.

1605
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:41,880
It's a big deal when you're super young,

1606
01:36:41,970 --> 01:36:46,200
like young 18 1920 all are to,

1607
01:36:46,201 --> 01:36:49,590
I'd say like maybe 27
maybe. I Dunno, maybe older.

1608
01:36:50,430 --> 01:36:55,140
This is less of a factor but at the
end of the day your joints are healthy.

1609
01:36:56,550 --> 01:36:58,980
You're going to be in a way better spot.

1610
01:36:59,250 --> 01:37:04,050
Way better spot then you would be if
they're not also another co a supplement

1611
01:37:04,051 --> 01:37:06,150
called joint warfare.
This one,

1612
01:37:06,151 --> 01:37:11,151
I mean they all have antioxidant stuff
in them but joint warfare has glucosamine

1613
01:37:11,491 --> 01:37:14,340
and conjoin.
This is for what?

1614
01:37:14,341 --> 01:37:18,660
Like cartilage tendon type
stuff and curcumin. Curcumin,

1615
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:23,880
yeah, so you put those together. Boom. The
ultimate joint supplements, the big deal.

1616
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:25,013
Huge deal.

1617
01:37:25,290 --> 01:37:30,290
Like you can be super strong
and be lifting and but you
got to warm up like for

1618
01:37:30,481 --> 01:37:34,740
20 sets just because your joints
are all like stiff and whatever.

1619
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:39,780
Sade say bye to that problem.
You take these, there it is.

1620
01:37:39,810 --> 01:37:41,700
Boom.
Joint supplements get on it.

1621
01:37:41,730 --> 01:37:45,810
Go to or do you mean.com also

1622
01:37:45,811 --> 01:37:48,900
This is for your brain,
makes your brain work better.

1623
01:37:48,930 --> 01:37:50,130
It's nutrients for your brain.

1624
01:37:50,190 --> 01:37:53,880
That's what it is and also
nutrients for your body.

1625
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:55,980
So a pre workout,

1626
01:37:55,980 --> 01:38:00,750
it's a pre study. It's a pre mission
supplement called discipline.

1627
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:06,210
Get Down? Same, same place or do you
mean.com tastes good too, by the way.

1628
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:08,010
Is other flavor out?
When does the other flavor out?

1629
01:38:08,490 --> 01:38:12,030
We're making it right now so soon.

1630
01:38:12,670 --> 01:38:17,190
[inaudible] a little further than
soon. Soon to me is like, yeah,

1631
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:22,310
like a little more distant than soon.
But we're working on shipping. Yeah,

1632
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:25,170
that's soon to me. And is Pina
Colada by the way? Oh, sorry.

1633
01:38:27,050 --> 01:38:30,870
I got a different name for
it. Yeah. Uh, coconut. No,

1634
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:34,580
I got a better name for it. I bought
it later. Oh, later. Okay. Secret name.

1635
01:38:34,581 --> 01:38:38,700
Cause I'm not sure if it's legal or not
the name. Okay, Gotcha. You have in mind.

1636
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:40,190
All right, cool. Well,

1637
01:38:40,270 --> 01:38:44,040
so we're all very excited about the name
and the tastes and you know, whatnot.

1638
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:48,510
Pineapple, coconut is the
working title, working title.

1639
01:38:50,310 --> 01:38:54,360
There you go. Uh, cognitive and
physical force multiplier. Good one.

1640
01:38:54,390 --> 01:38:57,360
Also milk. Okay, so milk,

1641
01:38:59,790 --> 01:39:01,650
I'm going to say the word protein powder,

1642
01:39:01,651 --> 01:39:05,400
but I'm not saying Malki
is protein powder. Oh yeah.

1643
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:08,790
If you want some additional protein,
what's a good way to get it?

1644
01:39:09,330 --> 01:39:12,180
That happens to taste really,
really good.

1645
01:39:12,210 --> 01:39:15,210
Like a mint chocolate milkshake,

1646
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:20,010
not a diet and milkshake. I like
a mint chocolate milkshake. Right.

1647
01:39:20,011 --> 01:39:23,370
And you want protein, take milk,
take it every day if you want to.

1648
01:39:23,371 --> 01:39:25,250
My buddy sent me a text, he goes, yeah,

1649
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:30,290
I saw that mark had probiotics
in it. Dang. Even better. Yes.

1650
01:39:30,330 --> 01:39:34,920
And he said, I, he said, so I just ordered
it because I need some. Yeah. And He,

1651
01:39:34,921 --> 01:39:39,620
and he's like, Whoa, this stuff is
good. I said, yeah, I know. I said,

1652
01:39:39,630 --> 01:39:41,610
I know. And he's like, yeah, it's awesome.

1653
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:46,490
So you can anyways making
the supersize milk shake.

1654
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:51,180
Yeah. Hey man, I can relate because
that's literally what I do. Yeah, no,

1655
01:39:51,181 --> 01:39:53,550
I could tell when you
got on the mark train,

1656
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:58,470
cause your attitude changed. You
know you went from like, Oh yeah,

1657
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:02,280
we've got more cause it's good and blah
blah, blah. To when you were like, hey,

1658
01:40:03,370 --> 01:40:07,830
it's kind be a game changer.
You know, it's, it's so failing.

1659
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:12,900
What does it makes it so feeling,
feeling like, like when you eat it,

1660
01:40:12,930 --> 01:40:15,690
you just feel complete.
When you drink it, you feel,

1661
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:20,800
say she'd completely say sheath.
That's why you know,

1662
01:40:20,801 --> 01:40:24,360
you know the term meal replacement like
oh we kind of meal replacement sir.

1663
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:29,250
This isn't supposed to be a meal
replacement. It's not supposed to be.

1664
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:33,060
The intent wasn't okay. Replace.
But what happens is if you have it,

1665
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:36,060
like yesterday I had one in the,

1666
01:40:36,150 --> 01:40:41,100
in the afternoon I had a light launch,
which was crap. I ate a crap lunch.

1667
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:46,290
Like not not, not healthy.
Gotcha. Little off the path. Cool.

1668
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:50,760
So I was feeling like, ah,
okay. And then so in the,

1669
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:52,110
a little later than that I said,
you know what,

1670
01:40:52,111 --> 01:40:55,420
I'm going to have some bulk right
now to try to reset the path. Yeah.

1671
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:59,080
And then I got home from Jiu
Jitsu last night, six hours later,

1672
01:40:59,350 --> 01:41:03,700
didn't even barely eat anything for dinner
because I was still full. Why is that?

1673
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:09,250
Amen. It's, I'm feeling satiated.

1674
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:14,940
Satisfied, satisfies you on multiple
fronts. Plus it's psychologically come,

1675
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:17,710
come on. And you kind of knew that it
was the mall can, you were like solid.

1676
01:41:17,711 --> 01:41:20,200
We felt good about that.
You were satisfied about that.

1677
01:41:20,201 --> 01:41:25,120
That's probably a big factor. So it's
not supposed to be a meal replacement,

1678
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:28,390
but that's not what it was engineered.
That's what it was an engineered for.

1679
01:41:28,391 --> 01:41:30,070
But it turns out that if you have it,

1680
01:41:30,071 --> 01:41:33,790
you won't be that hungry
because you'd be so full. Yeah.

1681
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:38,680
Yes. True for milk. No
big deal. So it's so,

1682
01:41:38,950 --> 01:41:41,980
it's so different.
We had to create a different word for it.

1683
01:41:42,490 --> 01:41:46,030
That's going to be in the Oxford English
dictionary soon. I'm sure it will.

1684
01:41:46,230 --> 01:41:51,040
It'll be, oh, it'll be, they'll
have to define it in the OED.

1685
01:41:51,130 --> 01:41:54,910
You know what the OED is? Oxford
English dictionary. Yeah. Yeah.

1686
01:41:54,970 --> 01:41:58,510
That's the real deal right there.
There you go. That's the big one. Yeah,

1687
01:41:58,511 --> 01:42:02,950
that's the big one. That's the mother of
all dictionaries. Must Be. It must be.

1688
01:42:02,951 --> 01:42:06,680
It is. There's no must be. Dang. And
milk is going to be in there. You said

1689
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:09,160
we'll petition.

1690
01:42:09,310 --> 01:42:11,650
I won't even have to petition for
cause people are just going to start.

1691
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:15,310
That's how I was just going to be here.
It's just going to be how and it really,

1692
01:42:15,311 --> 01:42:20,170
that's how words get in the dictionary.
Just keep using it. And here's the,

1693
01:42:20,171 --> 01:42:23,290
here's the good thing about that word.
Not to go off on too much of a tangent,

1694
01:42:23,291 --> 01:42:26,980
but a will and I don't mind
doing it with this situation.

1695
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:31,350
Mark is the actual legitimate
situation. Mark. It's more mark,

1696
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:36,250
but it's not like the word regardless
and misusing the word because they're not

1697
01:42:36,670 --> 01:42:39,850
educated on that specific word.
And they use your regardless.

1698
01:42:40,090 --> 01:42:41,900
Their friend uses their neighbor
use it there. Who knows?

1699
01:42:41,930 --> 01:42:45,720
Maybe we'll get in there too.
[inaudible] he's a Hawaiian word. I know,

1700
01:42:45,730 --> 01:42:47,620
but maybe we'll get it into
the English dictionary,

1701
01:42:47,650 --> 01:42:49,770
but it's not English cause
that's the thing done.

1702
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:53,500
The English dictionary is not filled
with words that are only English.

1703
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:56,760
The whole English language is
made up of other words. Gotcha.

1704
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:01,570
Consult kind of pile on in there.
Right. And milk. We'll petition.

1705
01:43:01,930 --> 01:43:03,940
We can't petition.
You don't petition to get them in there.

1706
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:06,910
You actually just use the words.
So like the word forte.

1707
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:11,320
I wonder if that's my forte. People
started trying to rip off milk. Yeah.

1708
01:43:11,490 --> 01:43:15,550
It'll be like, hey, we use xerox me a copy
of that. Right, right. It'll just be the,

1709
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:20,150
it'll just be the way. Yeah. Yeah. Instead
of be a new thing, like I'm going to,

1710
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:23,810
you know, first I'm going to work out
and then like I'm just going to, um,

1711
01:43:24,070 --> 01:43:28,850
I'm going to, yeah. Oh, you picked
me up some milk from the store. Oh.

1712
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:32,680
And then people say, well what
kind of milk do you, right,
right, right, right. Yeah.

1713
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:35,470
And then won't we just be talking about
flight cause it'd be nine different

1714
01:43:35,471 --> 01:43:38,500
brands of milk. Okay. You're from the, uh,

1715
01:43:38,610 --> 01:43:41,980
kind of the easy way is New England east
coats at technically for sure as it can

1716
01:43:41,981 --> 01:43:45,930
see. Okay. So d d did you grow up
in a place where they say cokes?

1717
01:43:46,190 --> 01:43:50,260
No more pop. We called her soda. Call
it soda. Yeah, we call it the soda too.

1718
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:52,040
So I've, cause they'll soda. Okay.

1719
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:54,710
That's normal to me in, you know,
as far as my experience goes.

1720
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:59,750
And then there's pop, you've heard
pop pop. That's like the Midwest,

1721
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:04,720
Ohio. And then there's
coke, like coke, coke,

1722
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:07,993
sprite.

1723
01:44:11,660 --> 01:44:14,510
I had to do this. Uh, when I
was going to college, I had to,

1724
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:19,730
they wanted us to get the words for what?
Okay,

1725
01:44:19,731 --> 01:44:24,731
what do you call if you get an ice cream
cone and you get little flavored tiny

1726
01:44:25,521 --> 01:44:30,440
bits all over it, what do you call
those little flavored bits? Sprinkles.

1727
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:33,460
Sprinkles. That's, that's one
of the standards. There's a,

1728
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:37,760
there's some people that call
them jimmies. Okay. Okay.

1729
01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:42,410
My wife's from England and I,
and so I did this to her.

1730
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:43,461
So we had that.

1731
01:44:43,461 --> 01:44:47,540
We had a bunch of words that were broken
out that people call different things

1732
01:44:47,541 --> 01:44:49,580
like soda pop, what it like, what do
you call this? What do you call that?

1733
01:44:49,581 --> 01:44:51,200
Where you from? What do you call
this? What do you call that?

1734
01:44:51,740 --> 01:44:55,010
I did this with my wife and I actually
luckily recorded it because I knew it

1735
01:44:55,011 --> 01:44:59,330
would be interesting. How'd you record
it? Like on a tape recorder. No kidding.

1736
01:44:59,331 --> 01:45:04,080
Tape recorder. Old School. Yeah. And then
I go and I, so I asked my wife, you know,

1737
01:45:04,150 --> 01:45:08,180
what do you call the things that you put
on an ice cream cone that are a little

1738
01:45:08,181 --> 01:45:11,150
different colors and they're
little tiny bits of sugary candy,

1739
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:14,030
what would you call those? And
she, without missing a beat,

1740
01:45:14,031 --> 01:45:15,440
she goes hundreds and thousands.

1741
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:21,590
Hundreds of thousands.
I started laughing kind of a mouthful.

1742
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:26,900
Hundreds and thousands.
Yeah, yeah, there's no, and
then I said, because, okay,

1743
01:45:26,901 --> 01:45:30,260
what do you call
ham?

1744
01:45:31,010 --> 01:45:35,740
Manet's lettuce on a long bun.
That's,

1745
01:45:36,530 --> 01:45:41,150
what do you call that in the
sandwiches at me? There is no specific,

1746
01:45:41,151 --> 01:45:43,870
but I get it, I hoagie. Okay.

1747
01:45:44,050 --> 01:45:46,460
But I dunno like a sub
sandwich or something.

1748
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:52,660
We used to call the grinder. Yeah, this
is like a new England grind to get it.

1749
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:54,980
I want to get a grinder,
but my,

1750
01:45:55,010 --> 01:45:58,670
my wife calls it a bap bap,

1751
01:45:58,730 --> 01:46:03,620
bap bap. And this is like, I said, what
do you call that thing? And she's like,

1752
01:46:03,650 --> 01:46:08,200
oh, it's a bap bap cheese back. Anyways.

1753
01:46:08,230 --> 01:46:11,750
And was that just a long thin,
which like long look at subway sandwich,

1754
01:46:12,570 --> 01:46:13,403
sub club.

1755
01:46:13,710 --> 01:46:16,940
So at some point people are just going
to say moke and that's going to have a

1756
01:46:16,941 --> 01:46:20,980
meaning beyond just what
we have right now. Yeah.

1757
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:24,680
Because people will be
making it. Everyone's gonna
be trying to make it. Sure.

1758
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:27,620
It's going to be just so calm and you
know it's going to be, it's like, oh,

1759
01:46:27,621 --> 01:46:32,270
you'll have is going to replace, let's
say it replaces lunch, like, oh yeah,

1760
01:46:32,271 --> 01:46:36,920
I eat three meals a day. Breakfast,
Moelleken dinner. Right. Oh,

1761
01:46:36,921 --> 01:46:38,180

I have some milk's. Yeah, right. Yeah.

1765
01:46:47,901 --> 01:46:50,310
You're going to look on kids'
elementary school schedule.

1766
01:46:50,310 --> 01:46:54,840
It'd be like boom, you know,
recess and then you know,
1130 mark and then, you know,

1767
01:46:54,841 --> 01:46:58,920
boom. History, you know I got
you, man. That's where it's going.

1768

The Horn is going to sound
mock break, right? Yeah.

1769
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:06,870
Let's go get some milk for soffits.
Pau Hana. That's what I said.

1770
01:47:07,230 --> 01:47:08,700
A lot of times on that.
My part of the island,

1771
01:47:08,701 --> 01:47:11,510
we called it a little bit different.
Right, right, right. Got You. Man.

1772
01:47:11,970 --> 01:47:14,880

1775
01:47:21,781 --> 01:47:26,370
You're good. Yeah. Pau and I didn't
analyze it means finish work.

1776

It means when you're done work your
pile Ho. I know exactly what it come on.

1777
01:47:30,090 --> 01:47:33,180
This is for the people maybe
explain that to me yet,

1778
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:37,600
but if you say pau pau sounds like peel,

1779
01:47:37,650 --> 01:47:42,420
pow like pop pow. That
means finished. Literal.

1780
01:47:42,550 --> 01:47:45,770
Yup. Directress you pile. Yep. Right.

1781
01:47:45,771 --> 01:47:50,370
You finished a I pal. Yup,
I'm finished. Definitely.

1782
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:55,520
Yup. Did you do like, no,

1783
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:56,191
you're doing,

1784
01:47:56,191 --> 01:48:00,870
it means doing like if you say Hannah
hope that means let's do it again.

1785
01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:04,020
You know, whatever it is. Or like
if someone, usually they say, well,

1786
01:48:04,021 --> 01:48:08,820
a commonplace they say it is like if a
band is playing and it's like a dope song

1787
01:48:08,821 --> 01:48:12,460
and they killed it, they say,
Hon, I hope means like do it
again. Play it again, man.

1788
01:48:12,461 --> 01:48:15,420
I remember yelling that when
I was a kid or if you go,

1789
01:48:17,540 --> 01:48:20,190
you go do something fun
and you guys are done.

1790
01:48:20,191 --> 01:48:24,180
You say your goodbyes to your friends
and you say what tomorrow Honohan means

1791
01:48:24,210 --> 01:48:26,970
you wouldn't do that thing tomorrow.
It's good again,

1792
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:32,880
unless back to origin, our company
origin made in America. By the way,

1793
01:48:33,030 --> 01:48:33,863
this stuff,

1794
01:48:33,870 --> 01:48:38,870
good stuff including gs four
digit to starting Jujitsu.

1795
01:48:39,900 --> 01:48:42,180
You ask, ask me as Jocko whatever. If you,

1796
01:48:42,210 --> 01:48:44,820
if you asked me or Jocko
what gt get here it is,

1797
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:49,500
I'll end compromised.
Not uncompromised.

1798
01:48:49,770 --> 01:48:54,060
No exception,
no exception that I can think of anyway.

1799
01:48:54,840 --> 01:48:57,750
You get an origin geek for many,
many reasons.

1800
01:48:57,751 --> 01:48:59,100
I'm not going to go into all of them,

1801
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:03,860
but they are made in America and they're
made for Jujitsu. Sounds Weird, right?

1802
01:49:04,010 --> 01:49:07,080
Like a 40 minutes.
Did you do to get gifts made for Jujitsu?

1803
01:49:08,070 --> 01:49:10,680
Not as much as the origin Geek.
That's the thing.

1804
01:49:11,190 --> 01:49:16,190
You have a Jujitsu guy who is an expert
in textiles manufacturing some fashion.

1805
01:49:18,270 --> 01:49:22,560
I know. I know, but it's part of
it. And he's like, you know what,

1806
01:49:22,590 --> 01:49:26,850
I'm going to make a geek for Jujitsu,
for doing Jujitsu in,

1807
01:49:27,270 --> 01:49:29,030
you know,
not just hey AGI,

1808
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:32,310
which is cool and you can use a Virginia
to let's make a bunch of blanks and

1809
01:49:32,311 --> 01:49:34,810
whatever brands can buy
them from us and you know,

1810
01:49:34,830 --> 01:49:37,260
just kind of this thing and we'll
ship into them in the u s no,

1811
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:42,680
it's not that Pete made Jujitsu gies
four digit to shape for Jujitsu woven for

1812
01:49:44,191 --> 01:49:48,100
Jujitsu. That's important part. Yeah.
So when you put it on, you do that.

1813
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:52,630
You did too. Yeah. And when you put it
in the dryer, it actually dries. Yeah.

1814
01:49:52,930 --> 01:49:56,410
Which is even so this is totally geeky.
These keys,

1815
01:49:56,411 --> 01:50:00,670
all of them perform when you do and you
do too. And when you're not junior. Yeah.

1816
01:50:01,210 --> 01:50:03,850
Boom. There it is. And all made in
America. Did I mention that everything,

1817
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:07,950
even the threads are made in America.
Even the cotton is grown in America. Nope.

1818
01:50:08,050 --> 01:50:09,400
Yeah.
Most of us already know that,

1819
01:50:09,401 --> 01:50:12,160
but I'm going to say it again because
some of us don't necessarily know that.

1820
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:12,770
Now we do.

1821
01:50:12,770 --> 01:50:16,150
It's pretty cool when you're putting
on a g and you know the people that

1822
01:50:16,151 --> 01:50:20,080
actually made it. Yeah.
That's what made it. Yeah.

1823
01:50:21,830 --> 01:50:22,280
And when you're,

1824
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:26,840
when you know you're supporting the
economic growth of this country.

1825
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:29,163
Yes.

1826
01:50:29,330 --> 01:50:32,960
And at the same time you're getting the
best possible ghee you can get. Yeah.

1827
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:35,660
I'd say that's 100% positive.
That's a win win.

1828
01:50:35,970 --> 01:50:39,130
Yeah. When came across the board and
everyone's kind of in the game together,

1829
01:50:39,131 --> 01:50:43,180
you have that additional like
additional feeling situation.

1830
01:50:43,690 --> 01:50:47,950
That's my opinion. That's my
experience anyway. Also, rash guards,

1831
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:52,300
these are good rash guards by the
way. Um, well inventing in good,

1832
01:50:52,660 --> 01:50:55,330
good rash guards. Is that just
a matter of opinion? Okay.

1833
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:59,260
Or you.com look at the rash guards.
You'll like one,

1834
01:51:00,190 --> 01:51:01,140
get one of those.
Boom.

1835
01:51:03,370 --> 01:51:05,500
Also the immersion camp you
did through immersion camp.

1836
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:10,920
One of the best ways to learn anything
including but not limited to Jujitsu is

1837
01:51:12,071 --> 01:51:16,270
day Merce yourself in it.
Immerse yourself in Jujitsu.

1838
01:51:16,510 --> 01:51:19,330
You can't on August 26

1839
01:51:21,220 --> 01:51:25,730
two sessions, you can go from
the (262) 072-0820 nine now.

1840
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:27,490
And then the second session,

1841
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:32,470
the 30th through the second September
2nd or he can do it all either way.

1842
01:51:32,550 --> 01:51:35,390
More stuff. And you just do, Dean
is going is deemed going. Yes.

1843
01:51:35,530 --> 01:51:39,610
So Dean lister is going Jockos going,
I'm going

1844
01:51:41,620 --> 01:51:46,030
layoffs going race. Can Leif
Babin is going. Dave Burke's
going. Good deal. Dave.

1845
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:47,830
And Jp is going,

1846
01:51:48,970 --> 01:51:53,680
so maybe Mike in Flynn as
far as the echelon front,

1847
01:51:56,200 --> 01:52:00,970
maybe. Maybe not. No. I'm
telling they're not. So maybe
not. No, not, not going. Okay.

1848
01:52:00,971 --> 01:52:04,030
Got You. I understand now. Okay. Either
way, we're all going to be there.

1849
01:52:04,090 --> 01:52:07,750
And if the question it is,
I don't have any Jujitsu at all,

1850
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:11,590
I don't have any need to do to it.
I'll do I go to a Jujitsu camp?

1851
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:16,570
Yes. The answer's yes. Andy's
going to, it looks like, okay.

1852
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:21,640
Andy Barr training hardcore
for a ADCC and oh yeah.

1853
01:52:22,101 --> 01:52:23,960
Somebody asked if,
if there's an,

1854
01:52:24,140 --> 01:52:27,650
is there a chance to go see the
factory where everything's made? Yes.

1855
01:52:27,740 --> 01:52:30,980
And the answer is affirmative.
Uh, middle of the week,

1856
01:52:30,980 --> 01:52:34,810
Wednesday in between Jujitsu
sessions, go to the factory, you know,

1857
01:52:35,270 --> 01:52:38,390
get to see everything, get to meet the
people that make everything. It's awesome.

1858
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:42,110
Yes, very much so. That's a
good little hangout spot too.

1859
01:52:42,111 --> 01:52:44,180
Last time we were there were kind of
hanging out there for a little bit. Yeah,

1860
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:45,073
for sure.
It was kind of,

1861
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:48,470
but yeah, it's a good one. That's going
to be a good one. Eat some lobster too.

1862
01:52:48,471 --> 01:52:51,530
If you like lobster. I don't know. Some
people don't like lobster so and whatever.

1863
01:52:51,540 --> 01:52:55,700
Maybe that's not the draw. Yeah, eat some
steak. Boom. All good. Good camp camp,

1864
01:52:55,701 --> 01:53:00,110
Echo Lake layers. You
mean? I'll see you there.

1865
01:53:00,770 --> 01:53:05,770
Also for fitness gear on it.com/jocko.

1866
01:53:05,870 --> 01:53:10,190
Good kettle bells on there. The
Best Kettlebells, matter of opinion,

1867
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:14,230
my opinion. Yes, 100%. The
only kettle bells I have on it,

1868
01:53:14,231 --> 01:53:17,920
kettle bells and I think I have more or
less all of them. All of them except the,

1869
01:53:18,050 --> 01:53:22,820
this teeny tiny small ones
in one series or all of them?

1870
01:53:22,821 --> 01:53:26,870
All of them. All of them. All of them.
The Zombie one. Zombie ones. Well,

1871
01:53:26,871 --> 01:53:30,320
some of them were sold out. So
aside from the sold out ones? Yes.

1872
01:53:30,340 --> 01:53:33,470
Oh actually I don't have the star
wars ones yet. You're getting them.

1873
01:53:33,590 --> 01:53:35,360
But here's the same way they ask these.

1874
01:53:35,370 --> 01:53:38,960
So that's the team is in
the game a little bit.

1875
01:53:39,050 --> 01:53:43,430
So different inspired for Boba Fett.
Depends on the workout. But here's the,

1876
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:46,520
here's the thing, I'm gonna be honest.
Like if I do have the same weight,

1877
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:49,820
maybe I'll get one in one. You know,
cause I have double of everything here.

1878
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:55,280
But wait, double meaning for
total customers. Talk to each one.

1879
01:53:55,281 --> 01:53:58,970
Free Chan. You know, you'd
do the double hand. It's
situations. Yeah, those are dope.

1880
01:53:59,420 --> 01:54:03,740
Good thing too about on it.com that
website is the information on there.

1881
01:54:05,470 --> 01:54:07,860
Health,
various uh,

1882
01:54:07,900 --> 01:54:12,900
philosophies in pursuits of
exercises and workout programs.

1883
01:54:13,361 --> 01:54:15,190
Like depending on what you want to do,
stuff like that.

1884
01:54:15,460 --> 01:54:20,050
Good information about the
products to also socks.

1885
01:54:21,430 --> 01:54:23,320
I know. Seems like a small deal. I know,

1886
01:54:23,470 --> 01:54:26,650
but I just got some in their
dope and they're kind of like,

1887
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:29,430
you know how like when you're
going through the airport, right?

1888
01:54:29,470 --> 01:54:31,530
You've got to take off your shoes.
Some of us, some of us, you know,

1889
01:54:31,540 --> 01:54:33,730
I know I get it. Some people they
don't get to take off the shoes,

1890
01:54:33,850 --> 01:54:36,520
but when you got to take off your shoes
and you kind of have your socks and one

1891
01:54:36,521 --> 01:54:38,290
time, so I was going through,
I had the on it socks on.

1892
01:54:38,291 --> 01:54:41,200
It felt kind of some because it
felt dope cause they're kinda dope.

1893
01:54:41,201 --> 01:54:45,240
They looked dope. You know what
I'm saying? Whole situation. Brag,

1894
01:54:45,250 --> 01:54:48,820
get some socks and go travel
report back anyway. [inaudible]

1895
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:51,520
dot com slash [inaudible] let
a real good stuff on there.

1896
01:54:52,570 --> 01:54:57,570
Improve yourself also when
you are shopping or chew or
when you're going to shop

1897
01:54:59,591 --> 01:55:03,130
for any of the books that Jocko recommends
including Jacola's books by the way,

1898
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:08,170
extreme ownership, the updated one
way, the worry kid, both of them.

1899
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:11,860
Discipline equals freedom
field manual best kind of feel.

1900
01:55:11,861 --> 01:55:13,510
Men are best kind of manual by the way.

1901
01:55:13,870 --> 01:55:17,800
Field manual and you can read in the
field anyway when you're shopping for any

1902
01:55:17,801 --> 01:55:18,311
of these books.

1903
01:55:18,311 --> 01:55:22,540
I kind of organized on Jocko podcast.com
jock was books are on the front page

1904
01:55:22,541 --> 01:55:25,720
right there, kind of in plain view.
Murray designed the website by the way,

1905
01:55:25,721 --> 01:55:29,740
but this is going to stay the same.
I have a page though,

1906
01:55:31,370 --> 01:55:35,340
Jocko podcasts books or books
from the episodes, what it's
called. Anyway, top man,

1907
01:55:35,350 --> 01:55:37,910
you click on there,
they're all organized by episode.

1908
01:55:38,420 --> 01:55:41,300
Authors listed there with the title.
Boom, click through there. Boom.

1909
01:55:41,301 --> 01:55:44,730
Good way to support by the get your books.
Get your other stuff from Amazon.

1910
01:55:44,731 --> 01:55:49,140
Whenever you're getting
good way to support

1911
01:55:50,670 --> 01:55:52,350
people, don't think that's
a big deal. It's a big deal.

1912
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:58,350
Just that small little action
has a big reaction.

1913
01:55:59,600 --> 01:56:04,170
Kind of like remember dropping
a piece of sodium in water.

1914
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:08,550
I remember people had been reminding
me of that analogy on recently.

1915
01:56:09,860 --> 01:56:14,130
No, we haven't talked about it in allow
you drop piece of sodium and water had

1916
01:56:14,131 --> 01:56:18,780
explodes to huge small action by dropping
a small little thing. Big Reaction,

1917
01:56:19,260 --> 01:56:23,280
sodium. Fair enough. There
you go. Revisit down. Anyway,

1918
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:25,170
also subscribe to the podcast.

1919
01:56:25,171 --> 01:56:30,080
If you haven't already on iTunes and
stitcher and Google play or wherever else

1920
01:56:30,110 --> 01:56:34,770
you listen to podcasts, a lot of podcasts,
apps, so subscribe, good way to support.

1921
01:56:35,010 --> 01:56:39,210
Also subscribe on Youtube for the
video version of this podcast.

1922
01:56:39,810 --> 01:56:44,370
It's something in but what I call
it important the video version.

1923
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:47,910
Sure.
If you want to know Daca looks like,

1924
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:50,430
if you don't know where you
want to know what I look like.

1925
01:56:50,550 --> 01:56:55,550
If you want to know what the guests
look like cause that I think is going to

1926
01:56:56,370 --> 01:56:58,920
Pique your curiosity more.
So that's my opinion anyway.

1927
01:56:59,250 --> 01:57:01,860
Playing there is video version of
the podcast also excerpts on there.

1928
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:03,930
We'll put on there. Uh,
you know for, you know,

1929
01:57:03,931 --> 01:57:08,400
you want to share some lessons that Jocko
talks about with your friends online,

1930
01:57:08,490 --> 01:57:12,150
email it to him, whatever,
Facebook, whatever and uh, you know,

1931
01:57:12,210 --> 01:57:13,950
they're more likely to
listen to a little excerpt.

1932
01:57:13,951 --> 01:57:17,790
Then maybe a three hour podcasts on
something and sift through that one lesson

1933
01:57:17,791 --> 01:57:20,820
you wanted them to learn. You see
what I'm saying? Anyway, Youtube,

1934
01:57:20,821 --> 01:57:24,150
subscribe if you want. Good way to
support. Also, Jack was his door.

1935
01:57:24,151 --> 01:57:26,820
It's called Jocko store.
This is where you can get the shirts,

1936
01:57:27,060 --> 01:57:30,810
the very short that Jack was wearing
right now. You can have that exact shirt,

1937
01:57:30,870 --> 01:57:34,140
exact shirt if you want,
if that even means anything to you,

1938
01:57:34,620 --> 01:57:37,800
but I think the shirts are cool.
Discipline equals freedom. Get after it.

1939
01:57:37,801 --> 01:57:40,950
You know you want to represent in
your part of the world, in the field,

1940
01:57:40,951 --> 01:57:42,800
in the wild.
That's the weekend.

1941
01:57:42,830 --> 01:57:46,620
Get a chocolate store.com this women's
stuff on there as well and patches.

1942
01:57:47,310 --> 01:57:51,270
Hats to kind of hats, truckers
and flex fit. They're good.

1943
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:56,160
They came out good I think so. Go on
there. Let me know what you think.

1944
01:57:56,161 --> 01:57:58,290
You think they're good? Get something.
If you don't think they're good,

1945
01:57:58,291 --> 01:58:00,120
let me know how I can improve,

1946
01:58:00,121 --> 01:58:05,010
how we can improve collectively the
hat situations. People were very vocal.

1947
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:07,350
We invite them to be vocal.

1948
01:58:07,351 --> 01:58:12,351
If they think of a a product
or a shirt design or something,

1949
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:18,510
and I encourage that. Also, rash guards
on there. Good, cool. Rash guards,

1950
01:58:18,540 --> 01:58:21,600
19% increase in performance. What
we used to preach. You know what?

1951
01:58:21,630 --> 01:58:26,490
I'm going to go ahead and
continue preaching that.
Also psychological warfare.

1952
01:58:27,390 --> 01:58:28,650
I'll tell you what this is.
If you don't know,

1953
01:58:29,430 --> 01:58:33,150
it's an album with tracks of Jocko
on there. Each track not singing.

1954
01:58:33,190 --> 01:58:36,480
He's saying stuff and this is what
he's saying. If you're having, okay,

1955
01:58:36,510 --> 01:58:40,470
if you're having moments of
weakness on your kind of pursuit,

1956
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:45,310
your campaign against weakness is what
we're calling it. Having trouble wake up,

1957
01:58:45,311 --> 01:58:48,360
waking up in the morning every
once in a while or you're,

1958
01:58:48,390 --> 01:58:52,270
you're feeling you don't feel like
working out. I know. We know that.

1959
01:58:52,271 --> 01:58:54,070
If you don't feel like working out,
you still work out.

1960
01:58:56,350 --> 01:58:58,960
That's the deal.
You still work out if you don't,

1961
01:58:59,110 --> 01:59:03,160
but every once in a while you really
don't feel like doing it or you're so

1962
01:59:03,161 --> 01:59:06,420
caught up in this other thing and you
kind of play games with your mind,

1963
01:59:06,430 --> 01:59:09,460
you're like, you know what? I could
skip the workout in. It's justified,

1964
01:59:09,461 --> 01:59:13,210
literally justified because I would get
this other work done then I'm working on

1965
01:59:13,211 --> 01:59:17,680
right now. That's another one,
but you listened to this doc.

1966
01:59:17,740 --> 01:59:21,460
Jocko will tell you this track, when we
leave one of the tracks on the album,

1967
01:59:21,490 --> 01:59:24,190
he listened to it. Jack will tell you
why you shouldn't skip the workout.

1968
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:25,953
And guess what,

1969
01:59:26,020 --> 01:59:30,190
you won't skip to work out 100% effective
psychological warfare is what it's

1970
01:59:30,191 --> 01:59:33,600
called Jocko Willink. It's on iTunes
or Amazon and whenever you can buy it,

1971
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:35,110
wherever you buy mp3s,

1972
01:59:36,270 --> 01:59:40,050
that's where you can get it. Good way
to support check. Also you can get

1973
01:59:41,910 --> 01:59:42,900
Jocko white tea,

1974
01:59:43,560 --> 01:59:47,490
you can get it dry in little
tea bags and that's cool.

1975
01:59:47,820 --> 01:59:52,770
And now you can also get it in
a pan cans of Jocko white tea

1976
01:59:55,170 --> 02:00:00,170
tastes really good and more important
gives you an 8,000 pound dead lift,

1977
02:00:00,481 --> 02:00:05,410
which is, you know,
not a big deal. So, uh,

1978
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:09,840
no more of the sugar filled,
chemical laced, crappy energy drinks.

1979
02:00:09,870 --> 02:00:11,760
Those are gone no more.

1980
02:00:12,750 --> 02:00:16,620
Those days are over and said it's
time for Jocko white tea in a can.

1981
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:22,950
Uh, books. You mentioned them
the way the war, your kid series.

1982
02:00:23,940 --> 02:00:24,580
Okay.

1983
02:00:24,580 --> 02:00:28,150
Getting kids on the path now.
Discipline hard work,

1984
02:00:28,180 --> 02:00:32,440
respect the path to getting stronger,
smarter,

1985
02:00:32,470 --> 02:00:37,300
faster and better. And if you don't
believe me, if you don't believe me,

1986
02:00:39,100 --> 02:00:40,060
check out my,
uh,

1987
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:44,770
my social mutech on my
Twitter and you'll see kids,

1988
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:47,500
kids working out,

1989
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:51,100
cleaning their rooms voluntarily studying,

1990
02:00:51,101 --> 02:00:55,510
voluntarily doing book reports
voluntarily. Check it out.

1991
02:00:56,020 --> 02:00:59,110
It's awesome.
You can

1992
02:01:00,910 --> 02:01:01,743
see it there.

1993
02:01:01,990 --> 02:01:05,620
Get your kids on the path and get your
neighbors kids on the path and get your,

1994
02:01:06,160 --> 02:01:07,810
your nieces and nephews on the path.

1995
02:01:09,780 --> 02:01:13,980
Also a path of a warrior kid
that's all about hard work.

1996
02:01:13,981 --> 02:01:18,981
You can go to Irish oaks ranch.com and
get some soap made by warrior kid Aiden.

1997
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:23,700
He just started his own business.
I got stuff still. It's good to go.

1998
02:01:24,390 --> 02:01:26,540
He gets it from goat milk.
Yeah.

1999
02:01:27,690 --> 02:01:30,720
Let me ask his farm that again.
I said this before.

2000
02:01:30,721 --> 02:01:34,120
It's important to understand too with,
you know how you get like the,

2001
02:01:34,150 --> 02:01:38,140
your neighbor, whatever they
make their little designer soap.

2002
02:01:38,141 --> 02:01:40,070
Maybe they looked it up youtube or how

2003
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:41,390
to make it or whatever.

2004
02:01:41,391 --> 02:01:44,980
They put their perfumes in and they wrap
it up in a nice little net rapping with

2005
02:01:44,981 --> 02:01:49,310
a little ribbon on. It's cool. I dig it,
I dig it. But you don't really use that.

2006
02:01:49,311 --> 02:01:53,180
So you know, it's like, all right, I'm
not going to use it all. Thanks. You know,

2007
02:01:53,181 --> 02:01:56,780
and I got a soap decorative piece,
whatever. It's not that kind of,

2008
02:01:56,781 --> 02:01:59,560
so it's legit.
So you use this.

2009
02:01:59,570 --> 02:02:03,350
So I didn't even think to say that
because I thought everyone knew,

2010
02:02:03,770 --> 02:02:07,250
I guess know people get suspect
because he's a young kid maybe.

2011
02:02:07,310 --> 02:02:09,970
Or you just hear like, Ooh,
special. So I don't know.

2012
02:02:09,980 --> 02:02:11,090
Then depending on your experience,

2013
02:02:11,091 --> 02:02:15,380
I'm sure people don't give
you decorative soap items. No,

2014
02:02:15,390 --> 02:02:20,120
they don't regularly. No.
Okay. Do the good thing about
this soap from my opinion,

2015
02:02:20,180 --> 02:02:24,140
it's all about function. And this
soap will help you stay clean. Yes.

2016
02:02:24,990 --> 02:02:27,130
Uh, the discipline equals
freedom field manual.

2017
02:02:27,820 --> 02:02:30,440
You can give the gift of
discipline and you know,

2018
02:02:30,441 --> 02:02:33,490
if you know someone that's like sort
of maybe got a foot off the path,

2019
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:36,910
that's a person that's right for the
discipline equals freedom field manual.

2020
02:02:37,150 --> 02:02:41,130
Yeah. That's a person that you go, hey
man, it's got this book, man. Give it up.

2021
02:02:41,170 --> 02:02:45,520
Just take a look at it. Yeah, let's take a
look at it. Yeah. It doesn't look normal.

2022
02:02:45,590 --> 02:02:47,620
Nope. It looks actually pretty dope. Yeah,

2023
02:02:47,890 --> 02:02:51,300
and then they read something and
then they say, Oh, you know what?

2024
02:02:51,310 --> 02:02:54,400
I don't know for quite a long term,
gets them back on the path.

2025
02:02:54,401 --> 02:02:55,780
If you want the audio version of that,

2026
02:02:55,781 --> 02:03:00,610
it's discipline equals freedom field
manual. It's, it's not on audible.

2027
02:03:01,060 --> 02:03:04,990
It's on iTunes, Amazon music,
Google play, other MP3 platforms.

2028
02:03:05,020 --> 02:03:06,970
That's where it's at.
Also for leadership,

2029
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:10,390
extreme ownership is the leadership
book for the battlefield,

2030
02:03:10,450 --> 02:03:12,490
for business and for life.
Now,

2031
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:17,520
the audible version of that is available
on audible and it is me reading it and

2032
02:03:19,541 --> 02:03:20,680
it's Leif Babin reading it,

2033
02:03:20,681 --> 02:03:23,460
otherwise known as Texas
Batman because he talks to me,

2034
02:03:25,150 --> 02:03:27,940
so if you want to hear us read it,
not just reading it,

2035
02:03:27,941 --> 02:03:31,300
but there's also sound effects, some
sound effects. We didn't go overboard,

2036
02:03:31,301 --> 02:03:34,210
even though we were attempted.
We had to pull the reigns a little bit,

2037
02:03:35,590 --> 02:03:39,160
but I don't know why it didn't very
talk about this very much, but yeah,

2038
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:40,353
check it out.

2039
02:03:40,570 --> 02:03:45,570
The audible version of that book also
do September 25th the follow on book two

2040
02:03:47,141 --> 02:03:49,210
extreme ownership.
It's called the dichotomy of leadership.

2041
02:03:49,211 --> 02:03:52,720
It's available for preorder right now,
Amazon,

2042
02:03:53,110 --> 02:03:55,420
Barnes and noble local bookstore.

2043
02:03:56,230 --> 02:04:00,100
If you want that first edition version,
which you do

2044
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:03,610
in order it now,
that way the

2045
02:04:05,110 --> 02:04:10,110
the publishing company who's lagging
doesn't get it living in the stone ages.

2046
02:04:10,300 --> 02:04:13,180
They won't print it enough
and then you won't get a copy.

2047
02:04:13,630 --> 02:04:14,560
It'll take an extra week.

2048
02:04:14,561 --> 02:04:16,600
They've got to print more like
happened with the warrior kid.

2049
02:04:16,601 --> 02:04:19,660
Books like to happen with the first
extreme ownership like what happened with

2050
02:04:19,661 --> 02:04:23,930
discipline equals freedom field manual.
They ran out. If you preorder it,

2051
02:04:23,950 --> 02:04:28,950
they won't run out so preordered and

It's me, Leif, Babin, JP Denelle,

2053
02:04:35,741 --> 02:04:37,210
Dave Burke,
our website,

2054
02:04:37,320 --> 02:04:42,030
Ashkelon front.com and we solve problems
through leadership. That's what we do.

2055
02:04:42,150 --> 02:04:45,720
All the problems you have in your business
and your team and your organization,

2056
02:04:45,870 --> 02:04:50,460
the problems that you have, all of them
are leadership problems, all of them.

2057
02:04:51,510 --> 02:04:54,480
That's a bold statement to make,
isn't it? Yes, and it's factual.

2058
02:04:55,350 --> 02:04:58,200
You're not going to solve those
problems through spreadsheets.

2059
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,010
You're going to solve those
problems through leadership,

2060
02:05:03,090 --> 02:05:07,320
so let us know if you need some help
and of course there's the muster.

2061
02:05:08,580 --> 02:05:11,760
We've done five musters so far.
All of them sold out.

2062
02:05:11,820 --> 02:05:15,030
The last one we did in DC was nuts.
It was awesome.

2063
02:05:16,050 --> 02:05:19,470
Lot of knowledge that's getting put out.
A lot of intensity.

2064
02:05:20,460 --> 02:05:24,420
There's one more monster in 2018 it's
muster zero zero six in San Francisco,

2065
02:05:24,421 --> 02:05:27,480
October 17th and 18th it is
going to sell out as well.

2066
02:05:27,690 --> 02:05:31,110
Don't get mad when you can't
go because it's sold out.

2067
02:05:32,230 --> 02:05:36,360
Go and register extreme ownership.com
and also for current military law

2068
02:05:36,361 --> 02:05:41,310
enforcement, firefighters, paramedics,
border patrol, other first responders.

2069
02:05:41,490 --> 02:05:45,660
We got roll call zero zero one
September 21st in Dallas, Texas.

2070
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:50,720
It's a focused one day leadership training
seminar and it's aimed at people in

2071
02:05:51,361 --> 02:05:52,194
uniform.

2072
02:05:52,470 --> 02:05:57,470
Then you can also register
for that@extremeownership.com
and until the muster in

2073
02:05:58,111 --> 02:06:01,620
San Francisco or the roll call
or the immersion camp in Maine.

2074
02:06:03,550 --> 02:06:08,450
If you want to maintain contact with us,
you can find us on the interwebs.

2075
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:11,110
Echo is at echocharles
and I am at Jocko Willink.

2076
02:06:11,111 --> 02:06:15,790
And to those of you that are wearing
the uniform out there on the front lines

2077
02:06:15,791 --> 02:06:16,570
right now,

2078
02:06:16,570 --> 02:06:21,570
thank you for keeping evil at bay and
the vets that have already served.

2079
02:06:22,241 --> 02:06:24,280
Thank you for doing your share

2080
02:06:25,860 --> 02:06:26,693
and to the

2081
02:06:27,640 --> 02:06:31,780
first responders, police, law
enforcement, firefighters, paramedics,

2082
02:06:31,781 --> 02:06:33,160
border patrol.

2083
02:06:34,030 --> 02:06:38,410
Thanks to all of you for staying ready,
staying alert,

2084
02:06:38,411 --> 02:06:39,370
staying strong,

2085
02:06:39,371 --> 02:06:44,371
and keeping us safe here at home and
to the families of all that serve.

2086
02:06:45,040 --> 02:06:50,040
Thank you for your sacrifice as your
loved ones serve us and to the rest of you

2087
02:06:52,390 --> 02:06:57,000
out there.
Thanks for listening.

2088
02:06:57,360 --> 02:07:01,850
Thanks for supporting you actually make
this podcast possible. So thank you. But,

2089
02:07:03,110 --> 02:07:07,620
but nevermind all of that.
Thanks for doing what you do every day.

2090
02:07:07,621 --> 02:07:10,920
Thanks for waking up
early and staying up late.

2091
02:07:10,921 --> 02:07:14,400
Thanks for putting in the hours,
the long hours

2092
02:07:15,730 --> 02:07:16,690
grinding,

2093
02:07:17,640 --> 02:07:21,330
working,
making things happen,

2094
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:24,030
standing up when the hard times come

2095
02:07:27,120 --> 02:07:27,953
and they come,

2096
02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:31,640
you're not alone.

2097
02:07:31,940 --> 02:07:36,760
The hard times come to all of
us and when they do stand up,

2098
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:43,420
grit your teeth
and get after it.

2099
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:47,470
Until next time.

2100
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:52,090
This is echo and Jocko out.
