00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,570
This is Jocko podcast number 26.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,560
With Echo Charles and me,
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:12,271
Oh,

4
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:17,271
for a voice like funder and to tongue to
drown the throat of war when the senses

5
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:23,370
are shaking and the soul
is driven to madness.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,400
Who can stand when the soles of the
oppressed fight in the troubled air that

7
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:31,920
rages,

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,920
who can stand when the whirlwind of
fury comes from the throne of God,

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,660
when the frowns of his countenance
drive the nations together who can stand

10
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,920
when sin claps his broad wings over the
battle and sales rejoicing in the flood

11
00:00:55,821 --> 00:00:56,690
of death,

12
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:02,740
when souls are torn to everlasting
fire and feelings of hell,

13
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:07,760
rejoice upon the slain.
Oh,

14
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,240
who can stand?

15
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,960
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

16
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,480
That right there is a little excerpt
of a poem by a guy named William Blake

17
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:36,050
and it paints war as

18
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,600
uh, something so powerful. So evil,

19
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,720
something is super human

20
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,580
in the full poem is really a statement
against warning as it goes on.

21
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:56,780
And it's not that much longer,

22
00:01:56,781 --> 00:02:01,781
but it blames war on the politicians and
on the kings and on the nobles and it

23
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:05,390
blames war on the religious leaders.

24
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:11,120
But he asked that question over
and over again who can stand

25
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,300
and I can actually answer that question

26
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,620
and I've seen who can stand.
I've seen people break,

27
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:29,650
but I've seen many brave men and
women on the battlefield stand,

28
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,420
stand against fear and
death and stand against evil

29
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,930
stand as sin claps his broad wings over
the battle and sales rejoicing in the

30
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:51,860
flood of death.

31
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,890
And that's William Blake.
Those are his words,

32
00:02:57,891 --> 00:03:02,891
but he's writing that in the
late 17 hundreds and early
1,802 he had no idea how

33
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:07,420
bad war would get.

34
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,313
Okay?

35
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,190
And I'm not saying war is worse
in terms of individual horror,

36
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,490
but in terms of scale,
Mick can't be denied.

37
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,180
I mean World War One and World War Two,
the scale of horror,

38
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,450
it would be in comprehensible

39
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,750
to two man from Blake's time,
he just couldn't understand it.

40
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,240
So let's go to June 6th

41
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,430
okay.

42
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,840
1944

43
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,283
okay.

44
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:52,530
As the demon spread his wings
over the beaches of Normandy

45
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,300
and men stood against his evil,

46
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,710
the English Cox,

47
00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:14,070
and tried to drop the ramp a couple of
hundred feet from the shore when the

48
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:16,470
sergeant ordered.
Take us all the way in.

49
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:22,360
Just then machine guns opened up and
bullets tore through the wooden sides of

50
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:27,000
the landing craft wounding. Four or
five men, men be began screaming,

51
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,770
opened the damn doors.
Just as the ramp went down,

52
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,630
there was a pause in the incoming fire.

53
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,050
We exited fast diving into
the water and holding on.

54
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,040
Sergeant Trona was lying next to me
when he was shot through the wrist.

55
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,100
I crawled over to him
and gave him first aid.

56
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,150
We just let the tide wash over the
lower portion of our bodies using our

57
00:04:48,151 --> 00:04:49,440
fingernails to pull.
