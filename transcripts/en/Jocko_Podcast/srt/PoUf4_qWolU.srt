00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,780
This is Jocko podcast number
79 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,170
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good Amy.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,980
And it has been a little while since we
were able to hammer out some Q and a.

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,880
Sure.
Questions from the interwebs.

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,420
And so here we are number 79 let's
answer some questions from the interwebs.

6
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,880
What'd he got? Cool. Gill.
First question, John. Wait,

7
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,350
should we spend a bunch of time with a
bunch of fluff and talking about nonsense

8
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:35,550
or should we get to the questions?

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,640
Let's say we get to the question about
27 minutes worth of advertisements.

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,600
Let's get to the questions.
Rock and roll.

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,370
I am a vascular surgeon
training residents.

12
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,630
How do you apply decentralized command
when your team changes every one to three

13
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,170
month? Yeah, solid question.

14
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,540
And with something like that,

15
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:00,960
what we need to do is we need to get a
standard operating procedure in place

16
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:03,150
with clear documentation,

17
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:06,660
some kind of a qualification and approval
process and then a monitoring system

18
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:11,250
in place. Right. So this,
this the reason I can kind of,

19
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,750
the reason that's pretty easy transition
for me to make mentally is cause we

20
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:19,770
would have to do this kind of thing.
Sometimes in the seal teams when you get,

21
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,663
for instance,

22
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,880
you're overseas on deployment in a war
zone and you get some guys that show up

23
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,750
to work halfway through the deployment
or two months into deployment or three

24
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,560
weeks before deployment ends. You get some
guys that show up there, seals, right?

25
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:35,780
So they,
they,

26
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,420
they understand the fundamental concepts
but you haven't worked with them

27
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:43,320
specifically before. They haven't
worked with the platoon before.

28
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,650
They don't know the area of operations
that you're in specifically.

29
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:49,650
They don't know what kind of mission
specifically you're conducting and where

30
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,090
the Intel is coming from.
Big Basically,

31
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:56,091
I don't know anything other than the
fundamental knowledge of being a seal.

32
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,280
But as far as that particular job goes,
they don't know too much.

33
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:04,281
So what you have to do is you have
to run them through a bunch of

34
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:08,940
familiarization stuff very quickly about
the gun trucks and how your Humvees are

35
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:09,331
set up.

36
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:12,870
You've got to make sure they can get on
a 50 cal and a mark 48 and a mark 19 and

37
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,010
understand our crew served weapons and
how we operate them because our crew

38
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:17,970
serve weapons.
By the way.

39
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,180
A lot of times we most of the time
operating our cruiser of weapons alone,

40
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,600
so they got to make sure they
can do this Humvees right.

41
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,020
A lot of the older guys in the
seal teams before the war started,

42
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:29,400
they wouldn't know how
to operate a home fee,

43
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,110
so you had to make sure
they knew how to do that.

44
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:33,330
They had to understand the mission,
why we're doing the mission,

45
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:35,340
what was important about it,
what was the commander's intent?

46
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,940
They had to know the rules of
engagement because the military,

47
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:40,310
we'll take a guy that lands in country,

48
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,890
they'll give them like a 30 minute brief
to welcome to in country in 30 seconds

49
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:47,070
of it will be a rules of engagement brief
and they won't really understand it.

50
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,100
So you've got to make sure they understand
that you've got an when's the last

51
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:52,710
time they did med training?
Medical training. When's
the last time you did that?

52
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:56,310
Has it been like 12 years since they
put on a tourniquet? Okay, not good.

53
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:59,260
We got to get them familiarized on that.
How they going to stop the bleeding,

54
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,660
the different IED threats
that are out there.

55
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:03,460
Cause the ID threats change all the time.

56
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:06,610
What kind of trigger mechanisms are
being used and what kind of identifying

57
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:09,010
marks or for IED.
So there's all this stuff.

58
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:12,460
The list goes on and on and so you
have to develop some kind of a standard

59
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:14,260
operating procedure.
Hey, when a guy shows up,

60
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,440
this is what we need to do with them.
Boom, they need to go through this, this,

61
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:18,520
this, this, this, this little
checklist you put together.

62
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,180
And then if the person's a leader,

63
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,760
maybe you got to go and do a couple
left seat, right seat rides with them.

64
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,540
So does that mean, do other people use
that terminology? Left seat, right seat.

65
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,100
Not that I know.
Okay.

66
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:38,101
So if I was the platoon commander and
you are coming in to take over for me,

67
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,200
we would plan a mission together and I
would be in charge of the mission. Yeah.

68
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,920
So I'd be in the driver's seat
or like a pilot copilot. Yeah.

69
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:47,220
And you'd be in the next seat.
You'd be,

70
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,320
you'd be watching and you'd be in the
passenger seat and I would be running

71
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:53,890
everything. And then maybe we do that a
couple times and you're just watching me.

72
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,380
And then we switched seats.
You get the driver's seats.

73
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:58,990
But I'm still there watching
it and telling you to move
a little left to move a

74
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:01,930
little right. And then eventually you got
it. And then I'm going to leave, go home.

75
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,090
So maybe if the person's a leader,

76
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:05,920
you've got to do two or three
or four ops or whatever,

77
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,260
to get them a good turnover.

78
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,960
So that now when all of these situations,
or if you're,

79
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,490
if it's not a full on turnover cause
that you're going to walk away from,

80
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:18,640
but if it's just a, uh,
you've got some other groups,

81
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:20,560
small entity or people that are coming in,

82
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,300
you're not going to be able to give them
that full hundred percent decentralized

83
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:26,200
command,
right?

84
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:31,230
You're still gonna have to keep a little
bit more watch on them because you're

85
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:34,240
not going to build up the full level
of trust in one to three months.

86
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,350
That just not possible.

87
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,590
So there will be a little
bit of limitations,

88
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,820
but you can definitely,

89
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,360
you can definitely move
pretty far down the path.

90
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:47,950
And one other thing that's going to help,

91
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,960
I said document and that's really smart
to put together a document with very

92
00:04:55,241 --> 00:05:00,241
clear roles and responsibilities and
expectations and then not just give them

93
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:03,070
the document and say, Hey,
read this letter. No, no.

94
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,200
You sit down and go over
every single thing with them.

95
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,860
So what you're trying to do is you're
trying to condense this timeline of

96
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:10,900
building trust into the
shortest possible time.

97
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,920
And one of the ways you
do that is by condensing
everything into a simple, clear,

98
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:17,230
concise format, written
format, go through,

99
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:20,470
talk it with them so they understand
it and getting to do it very clearly.

100
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,480
Like when I was in tasking at bruiser,

101
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:25,690
I didn't lay anything like that out for
the platoon commanders for life in the

102
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,860
Delta platoon commander. I didn't
say, here's the rules and there's,

103
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,790
I did that over a long for your time,
you know,

104
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,490
over a year workup now that
now we did a few months,

105
00:05:33,491 --> 00:05:36,280
they kind of knew what the deal was.
But if I would have,

106
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,370
if that would've been my normal job and
I would have been getting a new platoon

107
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:42,370
commanders every three months,
every time they came in and be like,

108
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:44,350
are you a new between grantors?
We just hold up to the commander does,

109
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:48,790
this is the rules, rules, roles and
responsibilities. This is the, uh,

110
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,700
expectations that I have for you.
This is when you call me,

111
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,820
this is when you make a decision on your
own. Lay all that stuff perfectly clear.

112
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,910
And that way I could more quickly
develop a sense of decentralized command.

113
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,720
Now again, it's not going to
be full decentralized command.

114
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,220
You're not going to have to
just let somebody run with it.

115
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,460
They've only been together for three
months. And you know, I don't know.

116
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:09,170
I don't know what the timeline is too,

117
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:13,550
for a vascular surgeon to get total trust
in their subordinate vascular surgeons

118
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:14,810
or their subordinate team members.

119
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,430
But I'm sure it takes longer
than one to three months.

120
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,970
So how much can you condense the timeline?
What can you do to condense it?

121
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,010
Once you get a condensed,
as much as you can,

122
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,280
you're still going to have to do a
little bit more monitoring than you would

123
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:31,430
normally do,
but it is still going to be beneficial.

124
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,510
It's going to be beneficial for them
and it will be beneficial for you to

125
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,350
operate as much as you can in the
decentralized, uh, methodology.

126
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,670
So when you say condensed, the
timeline, that's for the procedure? No,

127
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:49,130
it's condensed. The timeline to build
trust. Oh, actually, so I want to,

128
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:54,170
decentralized command is about trust,
right? If I trust you and you trust me,

129
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:56,600
it goes up and down.
If I'm in charge and I trust you,

130
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,720
that means you're going to go out and
you know what to do and when you're out

131
00:06:59,721 --> 00:07:04,040
there you know you trust that I am going
to cover for you and I'm going to trust

132
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,030
the decisions that you make.

133
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,390
So decentralized command is about
trust and who would have trust.

134
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:12,800
We have to have understanding and in
order to understand things we have to work

135
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:13,131
together.

136
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:16,700
So what I'm trying to do is I'm trying
to condense the timeline that it takes us

137
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:18,500
to build trust and how do I do that?

138
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,650
I just am very direct and lay
things out in a very simple, clear,

139
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:25,820
concise format so that you can understand
it very quickly. That's my goal.

140
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,120
It makes sense.
Next question.

141
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,320
When and how is the right way to skip
the chain of command when you feel like

142
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:38,840
your direct superior is
a part of the problem?

143
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,150
Big One, big one. Because this is very,

144
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,360
very problematic and skipping the
chain of command is a last resort.

145
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,440
It is a last resort. Why is it
a last resort? Because when you,

146
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,670
when you skip the chain of command,

147
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:00,590
you're breaking the trust I just
talked about. You're breaking it.

148
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:05,660
The relationship that you've been
building, your damaging it, it's not good.

149
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:08,270
Sometimes it's an salvageable.
By the way.

150
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,400
Sometimes when you skip
the chain of command,

151
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:13,970
you will never be able to recover
from that. Now, of course,

152
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:18,050
if there's something that
the your immediate superior
is doing that's illegal or

153
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:21,710
immoral or unethical,
if that's the case,

154
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:23,270
then it's actually your duty

155
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,320
to go above them and the chain of command.
Now,

156
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,340
do you still first report it to them
and say, Hey, what you did is wrong.

157
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,790
We're not going to do that.
Yes,

158
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,330
you should tell them first unless
it's going to cause you to get in some

159
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:39,020
horrible situation. Now, this is an
interesting thing that I've thought about.

160
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,570
Let's say you and I are
working together. Sure. And,

161
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,570
and you're my boss and you,

162
00:08:47,571 --> 00:08:52,250
let's say you're doing something that's
immoral, illegal, unethical, right?

163
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:57,450
And I watch you do it and, and I, and I
see you leaning towards it. I'm like, oh,

164
00:08:57,451 --> 00:09:00,660
I think he's going to do something
that's illegal right here and I don't say

165
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:01,494
anything.

166
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,280
And then I watch you do it and then I
run up the chain of command report you in

167
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:10,260
Boston. You right. You gotta
be careful with that. And,

168
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,320
and I think when you work for someone
or when someone works for you,

169
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:20,610
you need to lay it right out of the
gate. Like, Hey, this is where I stand.

170
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,190
Like I'm not going to cover for you.

171
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:26,490
If you do some stupid illegal things.

172
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,530
You don't wait for them to do it
and then drop the hammer on them.

173
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,850
Maybe I'm being overly fair.

174
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,320
Maybe we should to be all out to
get people that are, you know,

175
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,890
doing something that they shouldn't
be doing part of the problem. Yeah.

176
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,000
I actually,

177
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:48,250
I believe that's my belief is when I,
when I meet you and I say, Hey, well,

178
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,830
what's going on? And you make a little
crack. You know, you make a little joke,

179
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,460
you know, you say, well, you know,
it's not like, it's not like the,

180
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,070
it's not like the, uh, customers
can really see that money. You know,

181
00:10:00,071 --> 00:10:03,440
let's say you're going to skim
money, right? You got, yeah.

182
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,150
You make a little joke like that,
you know, you and you're in,

183
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:10,200
what you're doing is testing the waters
with me testing my ethical or moral.

184
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:12,930
So I'd be like, yeah, there's no way
they would ever know. And besides,

185
00:10:12,931 --> 00:10:15,180
we pretty much work for
it anyways. Right, right.

186
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:18,040
You're going to see if we're going to
get that reaction with it. So, you know,

187
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,370
we just, you know, sometimes we
have good, got a little charge,

188
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:22,560
a little extra on that
install. Right. Maybe we're,

189
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,860
maybe we're some kind of installers
that house and usually, yeah. You know,

190
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:30,240
I usually throw a little upcharge on here
and they never know if that's type of

191
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:34,770
wall, whatever. Yeah. You throw
that test at me, it's my duty.

192
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,660
If I'm the type of person that's going
to report you for skimming money from the

193
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:43,650
customers, then I should tell you like,
hey man, that's not cool now. Yeah.

194
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,150
Now those customers that you know,

195
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:49,080
here's my view is those customers that
were out there trying to do this install

196
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:49,590
four,

197
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,840
they had to work hard for that money and
I don't want to be taken it from him.

198
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,560
Now you kind of know you better not be
doing that in front of me as opposed to

199
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,830
me smiling and going along with your joke.
And then three months later I report,

200
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:05,320
you know, a turnover report
to the boss man. Yeah.

201
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,600
So I don't think that's very
ethical. Evil. Yeah. It's
kind of like a mislead you.

202
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:10,980
It's a little bit of a backstabber.

203
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,020
Now are there cases of course where
somebody is doing something that's just

204
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,470
outrageously unethical and you
didn't know about it or something.

205
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,590
You pretty much know though you can tell
when people are doing shady things. So,

206
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,040
so I think that that is something,
okay, so let me, let me put it, let me,

207
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:33,270
let me close this thought or at
least make a point of this thought.

208
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,540
My point of this thought is it's the same
thing that happens a lot where people

209
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,160
don't like to have hard conversations.

210
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,930
So it's an easy conversation when you say,
you know what?

211
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:46,350
Those customers never know where their
money goes and it's only 12 bucks and

212
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:48,030
thing and it's no big deal.

213
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:53,400
The easiest thing for me to do is
to smile and say, Eh, yeah, right.

214
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,930
That's an easy, and, and, and that's
not that big of a deal, right?

215
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,790
It gets so much harder.
The further we go down that road,

216
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,110
it gets harder and harder
and harder because then you
start saying, hey, you know,

217
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:08,320
it's only, you know, we, we've been
scamming like 12 bucks. Guess what?

218
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:11,740
They never noticed this other charge
either. And I can get him for $62

219
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,210
and then all of a sudden
it's a harder conversation.

220
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:20,470
So have the hard conversation earlier,
it'll make it easier for you.

221
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,320
So
that being said,

222
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,690
now how do we escalate above you in
the chain of command? First of all,

223
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,850
my goal is to not escalate above
you and the chain of command.

224
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:37,780
My goal is to actually raise the situation
to you and bring it up to you and say,

225
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,560
Hey, echo, you know the way we've
been doing this job. You know,

226
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,840
I think we should do it a different way.
I think there's a better way to do it.

227
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:45,610
I think there's a better way to
treat the customer, whatever,

228
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:48,370
whatever the thing is, better
way to attack this target
or whatever the thing is.

229
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,890
And I'm going to have that
conversation with you like two, three,

230
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:55,540
four or five times to try and
get you to listen to me. Now,

231
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,540
if the conversation doesn't work,
I'm going to escalate it even further.

232
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,150
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna actually do a little write up.

233
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:03,040
I'm gonna read a point paper.
I'm going to say Echo.

234
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,720
I was listening and thinking
about what we're doing,

235
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,440
how we're hitting this target or how
we're loading out our guys or whatever,

236
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,690
and I'm going to write you
a point paper and I'm gonna,

237
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,790
I'm gonna lay it out for him
to lay out what my plan is,

238
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:17,680
what the cost benefits are,
and make that very clear to you.

239
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:23,220
So that way I'm giving you every ample
opportunity to listen to what I'm saying.

240
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,430
Right. And I'm probably
even going to say, hey,

241
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:31,750
maybe we should run this by, you
know, the boss to see what they think.

242
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,780
Because if you just keep disagreeing
with me and I said, you know, can, can I,

243
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:38,200
do you mind if I bring it to the boss
and see what he thinks now what are you

244
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:41,800
going to say to that most? Most the
immediates are not going to be happy,

245
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,370
but I'm giving you a heads up
because I'm just trying to play open.

246
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,720
And it kind of doesn't, it kind of make
them reflect too, where it's like, Hey,

247
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:52,600
I'm going to, you know, bring somebody
there with, oh, what did he say? No,

248
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:54,330
don't bring that to the
boss. It's kind of like, ah,

249
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,260
it makes it real overt that they're
not doing correct. Yeah. So,

250
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,790
so yeah, you say, and you might get a
boss, you might get a boss goes, yeah,

251
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,040
bring it to him. He's going to say
the same thing I'm telling you.

252
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,340
And then you go home. Maybe I'm
wrong, I'm wrong about this procedure.

253
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,150
Or maybe I'm wrong about how we're
going to attack this target. But it is,

254
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,360
and also this is a hard
conversation to have.

255
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,620
It's a hard conversation to say someone,
man, can we just bring this to the boss,

256
00:14:19,621 --> 00:14:23,770
sir? And, and, and again,
I'm not saying you say, Hey,

257
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:25,840
I'm going to bring this
to the boss and say, Hey,

258
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:27,550
would you mind if I got his opinion?

259
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,030
Would you mind if I see
what she said about this?

260
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,380
And that way we're,

261
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,870
we're not saying I'm going to the boss.
Go ahead and go over your head.

262
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:40,960
You can't stop me. No, that's
not what I'm talking about. So

263
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,310
there's that. The other thing
that you could, so that's,

264
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,070
that's sort of a direct approach
with your immediate boss,

265
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:50,890
which starts by the way, with an indirect
approach of being like, Hey Nico, you,

266
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,300
I was thinking about the way we're hitting
these targets. Wouldn't it be smart?

267
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,610
Maybe if we hit him from over here,
do you think that would work?

268
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:57,710
And now we're just opening up the
conversation. So we've done that.

269
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,130
I can also go indirect
with your boss. Right. So,

270
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,260
so your direct boss who's now to
up above me and the chain grant,

271
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:09,010
I can go in direct with him at
the Water Fountain, right? Yeah.

272
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,130
Hey. Oh yeah, thanks Paul.
See everything's going great.
Yeah. Doing a great job.

273
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:16,970
Yeah. Worker. Yeah, I'm on
echoes team. Yeah, yeah. No,
it's really good. It's good.

274
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:18,440
It's a tough mission. But you know, we're,

275
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,130
we're always exploring new ways to do it.
You know,

276
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,500
we're looking at some other ops.
I was thinking of the,

277
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:25,910
another way to hit those targets to kind
of like coming in from this direction.

278
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,020
Oh, that's all I did was just drop the
little plant a little seed, you know,

279
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,840
have that conversation come up and I'm
just going to, that's what I'm gonna do.

280
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,970
Plant the little seeds and try
and get them to maybe say, oh,

281
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:41,780
that sounds like a really good idea. What
Adecco think of that. I, I, you know,

282
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:44,630
actually I haven't talked to echo
about it in full detail, but uh,

283
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:46,790
I will not about,
hey man,

284
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:50,300
the boss asked me about this
and he was mentioning, you know,

285
00:15:50,301 --> 00:15:53,060
I mentioned this other way of doing it
and he thought it might be good idea and

286
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,960
I just want to give you a heads
up in case he says anything. Uh,

287
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,440
I didn't really have a
chance, you know, whatever.

288
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:02,150
So we're just playing the game
a little bit. That's that line.

289
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,980
I just wanted to give you the heads up.

290
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,600
I feel like that's like real good
when someone says that it is, however,

291
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:12,980
it also gets a, it's also a way
of saying, Hey, I ratted you out.

292
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,440
I ratted you out. Depending on what
it's followed with. It's like, Hey,

293
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:21,350
I just want to give you a
heads up. The boss, you know,

294
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:25,270
asked me about this and I didn't know
how to respond so I said this and he had

295
00:16:25,271 --> 00:16:26,220
to come and talk to you.
It's,

296
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,850
I just wanted to give you a
heads up that's different than I,

297
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,870
just to give you a heads up.
I talked to the boss earlier today.

298
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:35,030
I told him what your deal is, something
like that, that's not good for you.

299
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,010
So yeah, there's all kinds of shades of
gray there as well. And, and you know,

300
00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:43,970
I worked for for a while I was
the admiral's aid and so I,

301
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:47,990
and I worked for a really great guy,
great admiral,

302
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,320
who I had a really good relationship with,
you know,

303
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,850
and if I needed something he
was going to give it to me.

304
00:16:55,851 --> 00:16:58,010
And so when I was a task unit commander,
which is what,

305
00:16:58,011 --> 00:17:01,190
which is what job I went to immediately
when I got done working for the admiral,

306
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:07,510
I literally had a direct line to the
admiral because I had his cell phone

307
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:13,370
number. I had his office number
and if I wanted to call him,

308
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,590
he wanted to talk to me
because we were friends.

309
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,710
But that doesn't mean that I went to him
and said, you know, did all kinds of,

310
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,030
you know, I didn't do that. No,

311
00:17:23,031 --> 00:17:27,590
I never took advantage of that ad
at all and was always professional.

312
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:32,810
But there is this little story
where

313
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,630
as odd as this might sound,

314
00:17:35,631 --> 00:17:40,040
we were getting ready to go
into the limit and we needed a,

315
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:40,821
uh,

316
00:17:40,821 --> 00:17:45,821
what's called a large format color
printer and it prints out big pieces of

317
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:50,540
paper, large format. And
you need it because you need
to make battle maps. Yeah.

318
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,220
And you need a good one because
when you are on an operation,

319
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:57,180
every single guy in the platoon has a map.
So you could have,

320
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,000
you might need eight, 10, 12, 15, 30.

321
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:04,110
You might need 30 color laminated
maps to go out on a mission.

322
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,350
And for whatever reason, I think
we had one, it was kind of crappy.

323
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,470
And the boss, the admiral, you know,

324
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,080
I talked to him before I
was going on deployment.

325
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,570
I don't know if he called me
or I ran into him or whatever.

326
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,540
And he's the admiral in charge of
everything and he's just, you know,

327
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,730
getting a feel for what's going
on. And he says, um, you know,

328
00:18:20,731 --> 00:18:23,200
hey you everything you need for diplomate.

329
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,320
Cause he knew I was leaving in a
couple of days or a couple of weeks,

330
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:28,770
couple of weeks and I said, yeah, you
know sir, we're, we're, we're good to go.

331
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,860
You know, right now, believe it or
not, I'm just waiting on a printer.

332
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,930
You've got to get one of those large
format printers for battle maps.

333
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:36,090
But other than that we're,
we're rocking and rolling.

334
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,920
And like that afternoon I got back
to my office and the commodore,

335
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:49,500
so now it's two bosses above my immediate
boss at the seal team and one guy

336
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:54,270
below the admiral, we don't have like
a message for me. He was like, hey.

337
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,740
And Luckily I was friends with him.
I guess you need a printer,

338
00:18:58,741 --> 00:19:03,180
let me know what kind it is. Like thanks
for the heads up. And I was like, Hey,

339
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:07,770
sorry sir, I just saw him in the quickie
mart or whatever. But uh, but yeah,

340
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:08,540
you know,
you,

341
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:13,540
you gotta you gotta you don't want to
abuse that stuff at all and you got to got

342
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,030
to be smart about it and it's always
is, I'm telling you, it's always, it's,

343
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,760
it's not good to skip the chain
of command. It really isn't.

344
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:24,250
It's not going to generally is not going
to benefit you at generally going to

345
00:19:24,251 --> 00:19:25,410
put you in a bad situation.

346
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,860
It's going to give you less
leverage with your immediate boss.

347
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,590
Cause if I went above
the chain command on you,

348
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,000
even with you get redirected by our boss,

349
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,480
you are pissed and you're gonna,

350
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:43,500
you're gonna sabotage. Yeah.
It's like a, it's really,

351
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:46,500
it's a version of going behind
someone's back. Oh for sure. It is.

352
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,750
And it almost even feels like even
if you tell them, it feels like,

353
00:19:50,751 --> 00:19:54,930
oh you're going a my head going behind
my best. It's a really, it's a really,

354
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,360
it's a tough one. You got, you got to
use caution with that one. And also,

355
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:02,910
I'll tell you what else it is.
It's,

356
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,100
it's an easy, it's, it appears
to be the easy way out.

357
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,780
Like if you're not listening to me,
I'll call them.

358
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,930
She could go both the chain of
command instead of me influencing you,

359
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,140
explaining to you writing
point papers to you,

360
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,510
building a relationship with
you so that you trust me.

361
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,480
Instead of doing all those things
that take time and effort and tact,

362
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,090
I'm going to skip the chain of
command until your boss. So that's,

363
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:28,710
that's another negative about it. It's
a cop out. You shouldn't need to do it.

364
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:33,130
I can't like that printer
story I just told it like, Eh,

365
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,043
other than that,

366
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,020
me going above the chain of command
and that was almost a comical thing.

367
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:37,381
Like I said,

368
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:41,460
I was friends with the common or two
who always took great care of me and was

369
00:20:41,461 --> 00:20:44,130
laughing when he left a message like,
oh, thanks for the heads up. You know,

370
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:46,110
he wasn't mad when he said that he was,
you know,

371
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:49,300
he was laughing because here I was
getting ready to deploy to Iraq and what I

372
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:52,180
want is a printer.
That's what we need,

373
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,590
which can tell you how dialed in we
were and how much great gear we, yeah.

374
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,410
Because the only thing that was left
that we need to as a printer, you know,

375
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,360
that's where I was at when I get old.
Everything we needed,

376
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:05,350
but I needed a printer. So you went above
his head and I get it for the printer.

377
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,050
But you got to, you know, other than that,

378
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:11,500
it's really hard for me to think of other
times in my naval career where I went

379
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,010
above someone in the chain of command.
It just didn't happen. You know,

380
00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:17,440
I'm going to take the time to build a
relationship with my immediate boss and

381
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:18,610
they're going to do
what I want them to do.

382
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,740
They're going to get me
what I want him to give me.

383
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,260
They're going to support me the
way I needed to get supported.

384
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:26,920
That's what I'm going to do.
That's leading up the chain of command,

385
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:30,970
skipping the chain of command isn't really
leadership. Yeah. So try not to do it.

386
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,770
Kind of like when you're a kid and you're,

387
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,260
you got to deal with your
older brother or something,

388
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:37,230
but instead of dealing with them,
you going to tattle on him.

389
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:42,250
Something like that feel. Yeah. No,
it's the same. Same, a similar thing.

390
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,960
Not that my little brother tattled on me
ever in the flight. Yeah. Interesting.

391
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:50,740
How you, and it seems like this is
a common theme to how you were, uh,

392
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:55,790
like you want to try the most and the
best you can to deal with it yourself like

393
00:21:55,901 --> 00:21:59,110
the most for sure. From the
beginning. I'll own it. I mean,

394
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:01,570
just like how you were saying how
like if you've got to fire someone,

395
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,050
you know where you want to get to the
point where deal with it in the beginning.

396
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:09,040
Yeah. Like you can't, like just let them
do the wrong thing. He'd be like, yeah,

397
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,770
that's cool. Let them do it for years
and then be like, you know what?

398
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:14,440
You're fired because of all these wrong
things and you didn't even bring it up.

399
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,270
And I think about this too, like on the
unethical things you, you might be, again,

400
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,100
I'm going to,
I'm going to walk a fine line here,

401
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,000
but you might not recognize,

402
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,330
you might not recognize that what you're
doing is unethical. He might be like,

403
00:22:28,331 --> 00:22:30,310
Hey Jocko, you know, what I do is I just,

404
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:34,480
I always hit everyone with this little
extra $12 charge, you know, no big deal.

405
00:22:34,481 --> 00:22:38,560
No one ever notices it. And uh, you know,
we're working hard and you might just,

406
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,431
hey man,

407
00:22:39,431 --> 00:22:43,810
it gives you food for your kids and
you're working on a bunch of rich people's

408
00:22:43,811 --> 00:22:47,710
houses so they can afford 12 bucks and
it's not that big of a deal to you.

409
00:22:47,711 --> 00:22:49,990
And maybe somebody that you started
working for did the same thing.

410
00:22:49,991 --> 00:22:52,600
And that's kind of just the
standard operating procedure.
Whereas if I was like,

411
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:56,320
man, you know what, that's not
good. You know, that's actually,

412
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:00,400
it might not seem like a big deal, but
you're taking money. You're, you know,

413
00:23:00,401 --> 00:23:02,950
you know that puts money on your table,
gives you,

414
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:05,320
feed your kids and taking money
off their table. You know,

415
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:08,830
and whether they're rich or not,
money's money as I don't think,

416
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,600
I don't feel like we should be doing,
you know what I mean?

417
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:15,190
I can might awaken you and get your ethics
back on track and you might be a good

418
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:17,910
dude cause just cause someone was
skimming some money doesn't mean they're a

419
00:23:17,911 --> 00:23:22,660
horrible person, right? It means
that they went down the wrong path.

420
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,720
It just because someone goes down the
wrong path doesn't mean they can come back

421
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,860
big doesn't mean they cannot come back to
the right path. Man, if I was, if I was,

422
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:33,490
you know, executed every time I
did something that was stupid or,

423
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,980
or bad or you know,
I shouldn't have done,

424
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,200
I would've died a thousand deaths by now.
Right?

425
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,110
We grow up and we learned these things.

426
00:23:41,111 --> 00:23:44,290
We become better people but we only become
better people and we only learn these

427
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:48,650
things. If somebody teaches them to us
now we can learn the hard way, which is,

428
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,110
you know, all of a sudden someone
looks at you and goes, oh wait,

429
00:23:51,111 --> 00:23:52,580
what's this charge for 12 bucks?

430
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,010
And then they follow up all your receipts
for the last five years you've been

431
00:23:55,011 --> 00:23:55,550
working here.

432
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,250
And then they realize you've stolen money
from the company and stole money from

433
00:23:58,251 --> 00:24:02,870
these customers and they're going to
prosecute you because stealing over x

434
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:04,970
amount of dollars is a felony.
You know what I mean?

435
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:08,150
So then you learn your lesson, but
that's not the lesson we want to learn.

436
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:11,840
So having those tough conversations
like you're talking about having them

437
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:15,200
upfront and whether it's urine we write,
whether it's counseling somebody,

438
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,920
whether it's dealing with, you know,
my boss who I want to tell like, hey,

439
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:23,660
I think there's a better way to do this.
Any of those. The earlier you do them,

440
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,650
the easier they are to have.
And the longer you wait to do them,

441
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,330
the harder they get. Yeah. So also too,

442
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:35,320
it's just an overall help. Like, I dunno,

443
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,510
it's hard to not draw the analogy, not
analogy, but the comparison between um,

444
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:44,450
like your boss in subordinate's
type situation and parenting kids,

445
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,610
you know, like for sure. Just like,

446
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:49,970
are you saying sometimes people don't
know necessarily that it's unethical or

447
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,150
they don't know it's that unethical or
something like that? That's, that's it.

448
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,670
I mean, in my situation with
kids, like they don't know,

449
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,550
essentially they don't know
better. You know, like, I dunno,

450
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,980
you take a permanent pen and you
draw all over the walls here,

451
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,360
four or five years old and
you're like, yeah, sure.

452
00:25:05,361 --> 00:25:08,750
I've been drawing on paper
this whole time, so there's
no reason for me to think,

453
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:12,530
sure I should draw on the
walls, but there's really
nothing to tell me not to do.

454
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:16,940
So they do it and then they go get beat
or something like that or just yelled at

455
00:25:16,941 --> 00:25:20,990
or something. Some, some
punishment, straight up
punishment instead of, you know,

456
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,450
okay, you didn't know that. You
have to know this. You know,

457
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:27,260
it's like that kind of stuff. How are
you going to tell the story? We were,

458
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:31,040
I was going through officer candidate
school and there's a manual and you're

459
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:32,790
going through officer candidate school.
I can't remember what it is,

460
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:35,330
but it's all the rules of officer
candidate school, everything you,

461
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,730
this is how uniform supposed to be. This
is the way your locker supposed to be.

462
00:25:37,731 --> 00:25:40,520
These are the way you stay in
line at the Chow Hall. All the,

463
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,800
every single rule is in this book,
and I forget what it's called.

464
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,850
So you live by the code of this
book and it's very specific rules.

465
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:52,540
And there was a kid who was going through
officer candidate school with us and

466
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,500
he was from another country.

467
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,810
He had been raised in other country
and became an American citizen,

468
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:04,610
but he was from another country and
grew up in a really poor, you know,

469
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,440
a really poor kid.
So good for him.

470
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:09,460
I mean he had achieved incredible
amount finishing college,

471
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,420
going to officer candidate school.
It was awesome.

472
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:16,930
But he had some habits from growing up
in the third world that were a little bit

473
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,630
different for, you know, for Americans.

474
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:25,900
And one of the things that he would do
is he would urinate in the shower and,

475
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:27,680
and not just while he was taking a shower,

476
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:30,120
but when you come back from a class
or something, you know, you'd,

477
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,640
everyone has to go to the bathroom
at the same time. And so, you know,

478
00:26:34,641 --> 00:26:37,220
guys would go in and they fill up the
urinals and then there's nowhere to piss.

479
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,210
So what are you going to do?
Well,

480
00:26:38,211 --> 00:26:40,130
he would just go in the shower
and it's a big open shower.

481
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:42,410
You just go in there a piss right and
the drain. Like it was nothing. Toilet,

482
00:26:42,411 --> 00:26:46,800
shower, toilet, shower, whatever
day. And one of the American kids,

483
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,030
and I'm calling the kids, these guys
were all, you know, actually we had,

484
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,290
some of them were new kids
fresh out of college. The kid,

485
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,050
the kid that was urinating in the shower
was fresh out of college and one of the

486
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,390
older guys who was like me,
it was a prior enlisted guy,

487
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,370
he came to me and he said,
hey man,

488
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:07,950
this kids urinating in the shower
like all the time. And I said,

489
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,690
I said, okay, well we know run
the water. And he's like, Brandon,

490
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,380
I got to get the exact exact,
you know,

491
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,010
my squad's in charge of
cleaning in the showers.

492
00:27:14,011 --> 00:27:17,350
And so these are my guys on there on
the ground, the cleaning up his piss,

493
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,370
it ain't cool. And I was like,
all right, cool, I'll talk to him.

494
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,930
So I went and I said, hey
man, I said, hey, you know,
officer candidate, whatever,

495
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,730
can I, can I talk to you
for a second? He goes, yeah.

496
00:27:26,731 --> 00:27:30,840
And he comes in my room and
I said, hey man, you, you,
um, you know, you're, you're,

497
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,240
you're pissing in the shower.
Just wait for a toilet.

498
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,150
And he looked at me like I was telling
him that he shouldn't breathe air, right?

499
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:41,570
He was like, well, why? And I
said, I said, well, no, because
you know, you're, you're,

500
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,130
you're pissing where everyone
walks around and he goes,

501
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:48,600
you have to do a water to drain
pipes in. He goes, and I said, no,

502
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,770
it's not, just, just don't do it.
He goes, it's not in the rule book.

503
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,110
This is what he said to me. And
I go, what do you mean? He goes,

504
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,970
and he named the manual.
He goes,

505
00:27:56,971 --> 00:27:59,430
it doesn't say in there that you can't
piss in the shower. I was like, well,

506
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:01,680
it doesn't say you get piss on
my floor either order my bed,

507
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:03,660
but I don't want you to doing that.
But it was interesting.

508
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:08,661
My point is that his viewpoint was
like this was totally normal and he,

509
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,330
and he was a great kid and I just a hard
worker. But for him he was just like,

510
00:28:12,331 --> 00:28:14,910
what are you talking about? Why wouldn't
I pissed in the shower? All the,

511
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,430
all the pictures are taken.
I'm going to go piss in the shower.

512
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,070
Well next question, let's
move on. I got work to do.

513
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,930
And so I had to explain to him, hey man,
listen, it's, it's a little different.

514
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,560
And people that are cleaning the showers
don't want to be down on their hands

515
00:28:28,561 --> 00:28:32,280
and knees in your pis. So,
and he said, okay. And he,

516
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:36,210
he listened to me and,
but I could see that he listened to me,

517
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:40,890
but he didn't a hundred percent agree with
me. He was like, okay, that's fine. Yeah,

518
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,320
you kinda did that.
You know,

519
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:45,180
and it was one of those where I
tried to explain to them the why,

520
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,043
but it just needs,

521
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:51,140
it's like you're saying like he literally
didn't understand that that was not

522
00:28:51,631 --> 00:28:56,460
acceptable from a hygienic point,
hygienic, hygienic, hygienic,

523
00:28:56,461 --> 00:29:00,060
from a hygienic point, from a, you know,

524
00:29:00,061 --> 00:29:05,061
a moral or our morale point
of the morale down there,

525
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,340
cleaning up. So yeah, that
was a, that was good times.

526
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:12,820
You never seen that Seinfeld, you watch
Seinfeld ever. I know what that is, right.

527
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:17,370
I know it's too negative. That's
what they talk. He gets caught.

528
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:21,750
One of the guys gets caught taking a
leak in the shower at the gym, you know,

529
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,860
and take a shower and then it's like,
you know, they catch you in the,

530
00:29:25,861 --> 00:29:28,950
you're ostracized basically. I think
they even took his mat, I dunno.

531
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:33,620
But he was like, yeah, you believe this
there, whatever. You know, they're,

532
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:36,870
they're mad at me for, you know, pissing
in the shower at the gym. And he's like,

533
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,680
he's like, what, why are you confused
at, they're mad at you kind of thing.

534
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:42,020
And he's like,
it's all pipes.

535
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,940
We don't Google it.
You know,

536
00:29:42,941 --> 00:29:47,110
he's trying to defend it and you can
kind of see where in a small, teeny,

537
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:50,020
tiny way, if you don't think
about it. Yeah. Like why not?

538
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,070
It's going down the drain. You're not
pissing on the, on the people. Hey,

539
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,250
I was deployed on a ship and
I was an officer as an ensign,

540
00:29:56,251 --> 00:29:57,850
so I had just moved up from the,

541
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,080
from the troop virgin where I used
to be with the enlisted spine.

542
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:05,620
So we used to proudly call ourselves
and all of a sudden I was up in the,

543
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:10,400
in the officer area, in the A, what they
call those areas, officer country. She's,

544
00:30:10,401 --> 00:30:14,030
they have little signs, officer country
and he, Oh, no enlisted allowed lead us,

545
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,200
totally lead us. So I'm in there
and I'm living with, uh, uh,

546
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,530
we actually had four other seals,
the seal officers in this room,

547
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:25,090
in one of the seal officers, there was
a sink in the room but no bathroom.

548
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,250
So you just had a sink, you
brush her teeth, shave, whatever.

549
00:30:27,251 --> 00:30:28,420
But if you want to go the bathroom,

550
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:30,610
you to go down the hallway where
the showers and the pictures were.

551
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:35,200
And so one night I'm,
you know,

552
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:40,201
I'm like get stirred awake by some noise
and I see one of my fellow officers is

553
00:30:40,331 --> 00:30:45,260
pissing in the sink right
in sync and you know,

554
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:49,690
I, I was like, hey man, what
are you doing? He's like,

555
00:30:49,691 --> 00:30:53,110
I'm not walking all the way to then
down to the down to the bathroom.

556
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,820
And I was like, yeah,
actually, yes you are.

557
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:59,710
That's where I brushed my teeth homes
and he, and he was the same way.

558
00:30:59,711 --> 00:31:02,170
He was kind of surprised
like what's wrong with you?

559
00:31:02,171 --> 00:31:05,800
It's just pissed and it's the same pipes,
but right now do me a favor,

560
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,120
just walk on down there.

561
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,590
What if he urinated in the sink regularly,

562
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,870
but every single time when he was done,

563
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:18,810
he scrubbed the sync with like lights
and stuff, bro. It's all psychological.

564
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,530
I thought,
well it's not just psychological,

565
00:31:20,531 --> 00:31:23,620
but that doesn't even make it worth it
now. You might as well walk down there.

566
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,710
I dig it. But like what if that
was just his thing? I mean,

567
00:31:26,711 --> 00:31:30,460
well how would you feel about it? Don't
piss in my sink. Yeah, right. It's like a,

568
00:31:30,461 --> 00:31:34,660
it's like a, it's like a, um, what do you
call like a customary almost for reasons.

569
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:36,780
Of course.
The reason is don't piss it.

570
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,200
Actually in college we played football
and we did it like a nice facility too at

571
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:46,540
Uah. But the showers were like,
guys would do it all the time and,

572
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,740
but the showers were shaped different
where like let's say you're facing the

573
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:51,574
shower,
right?

574
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:56,860
Or you're facing the wall at the bottom
of the wall was like a gutter trench.

575
00:31:56,861 --> 00:32:00,640
Yeah. So it went down. So if you did
and one guy's would, it would go to Aa.

576
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,000
You weren't ever standing in it, you
know? So if you're standing in it,

577
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:07,540
that's like obvious, you know,
but, but guys would do it.

578
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,600
And when I first saw it I was like,
Dang, he just openly doing it.

579
00:32:10,601 --> 00:32:13,180
Like one of this,
I actually mentioned this,

580
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,130
maybe it's where I'm not gonna
mention cause it fits in the shower,

581
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:19,840
but he's like talking to me
while he's pissing in the shower.

582
00:32:19,841 --> 00:32:22,570
Almost like it was a straight up toilet.
It was like I said and he's like, yeah,

583
00:32:22,571 --> 00:32:27,130
I'll talk to me. And I'm like,
alright. That's how, so again,

584
00:32:27,131 --> 00:32:28,980
it's more like the ethics of the,
like the,

585
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:32,200
the culture almost is what it seemed like.
Yeah.

586
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:35,360
What it seems like to me is don't
piss in my sink. I agree. Oh yeah.

587
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:40,040
The sink is different. Different
ballgame. Yeah. Shower. Okay.

588
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,860
Understood. Right. Like you said,
it goes down the drain and it's,

589
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,340
there's water flowing all over it.
Yeah.

590
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:51,140
You're washing it off anyway off the slope
coming over it. But uh, you know what,

591
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:55,870
I got a good idea. Just as a
general overall rule, pissing the I,

592
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,160
we better do that one.
Yeah.

593
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,060
The same way and probably not going
to brush your teeth in the toilet.

594
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,750
That's what the thing is now.
If you want to pay,

595
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:07,940
if you want to brush your teeth in the
toilet, have at it. I won't be mad at you.

596
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:12,470
I'll be mad at you. I don't know if I can
hang out with you as much or whatever,

597
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,600
but yeah, I understand.
It makes sense. Talking,

598
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:19,190
talking toilets from talking about
skipping the chain of command. Oh yeah,

599
00:33:19,191 --> 00:33:22,370
that's right. Cause the guide ocs
officer candidate school. Yeah.

600
00:33:22,371 --> 00:33:24,180
You got us into the shower.
He had to let them know up.

601
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,200
You've got to have the hard conversations.
I wonder whatever happened to him.

602
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,820
He was a hard work where we see from

603
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,810
somewhere like Vietnam

604
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,930
or Laos or something.

605
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,043
MMM.

606
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:43,100
Maybe Thailand, some Asian, Asian
countries. Southeast Asian country.

607
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:46,860
Yeah. Hard worker and smart.
Yeah. I would think, yeah.

608
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:52,390
My opinion about taking a
leak in the shower is you
shouldn't do it. But if like,

609
00:33:52,391 --> 00:33:54,380
like this guy who's like,
oh that's normal.

610
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,860
That doesn't totally surprise me though.
Yeah. No, it doesn't surprise me,

611
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:02,540
but it makes sense that guys didn't
like it though. For sure. Next question.

612
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:08,650
And, and, and don't skip the chain of
command if you can avoid it by yeah,

613
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:13,550
don't do that either. Yeah. Anything
going behind someone's back.

614
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,640
It just, it just like how you say it,
it's like sometimes you can't repair that.

615
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,050
It's harder to repair,

616
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,230
harder to repair.
Hello.

617
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:27,610
How do you rank your
longevity in your priorities?

618
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:32,890
Longevity. This is talking about
staying alive for as long as possible.

619
00:34:32,891 --> 00:34:37,450
And of course, I mean I want
to live, oh like how do I,

620
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:39,950
how do I personally,
that's the way it was court.

621
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,120
The question is actually directed at me.
Jocko Willink. Question for the podcast.

622
00:34:43,121 --> 00:34:45,010
How do you rank your
longevity and your priorities?

623
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,960
Longevity being how long are you
going to live for? And for me,

624
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:54,220
I mean obviously the longevity
has some level of importance.

625
00:34:54,221 --> 00:34:58,550
I do want to live for a
little while longer, but, and,

626
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,560
and I think that generally my lifestyle
and my focus on health and fitness in a

627
00:35:06,281 --> 00:35:11,281
broad way align with
living for a little longer.

628
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:15,430
So, you know, working out
and all that stuff is good.

629
00:35:15,431 --> 00:35:18,550
But there's also an extreme,
and I don't know if you know this,

630
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:20,710
I don't know how much you know about
this or if you've ever read about it,

631
00:35:20,711 --> 00:35:25,210
but there's an extreme side of
longevity of trying, if you,

632
00:35:25,211 --> 00:35:30,211
if your goal in life was to
live as long as possible,

633
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:35,250
there's an extreme version of that. Do
you know about this? I Dunno how so? Well,

634
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:38,370
one of the biggest things is you,
you do

635
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,300
a calorie restriction from
massive calorie restriction.

636
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,440
You're talking like massive calorie
restriction and that's one of them.

637
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,940
You and,
and believe it or not,

638
00:35:47,941 --> 00:35:52,090
you do extremely low levels
of physical activity. Yeah.

639
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:57,660
Right? You, you basically, if your
goal was to live as long as possible,

640
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:02,930
you would want to live basically in a
bubble and do nothing but eat very little

641
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,120
and just lay there. Hmm. Um,

642
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:14,820
no Jujitsu, didn't know surfing,
no lifting, heavy weights,

643
00:36:14,821 --> 00:36:19,740
none of that stuff.
Now when you're in that mode of longevity,

644
00:36:19,741 --> 00:36:24,540
pure longevity, you are not prepared
for anything in the actual world, right?

645
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:25,600
Because your,

646
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:30,600
your heart can only beat so many
times and if the less you use it,

647
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,790
the longer it's going to be lasting.
But,

648
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,650
and I'm sure I have that not quite right,

649
00:36:37,651 --> 00:36:41,280
but the problem is if you're not in
good shape, when you get surprised,

650
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,240
your heart can't handle it.

651
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,520
That's the kind of people that have heart
attacks because the heart can't handle

652
00:36:44,521 --> 00:36:48,330
all this madness when it comes.
So I'm not going there.

653
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,650
It's not worth it for me too.

654
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,640
For me to live my whole
life as a sedentary person,

655
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:59,250
half starved and completely unprepared
for anything to happen to me outside of

656
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:02,820
my bubble is not happening. I'm
not going to live that way. Um,

657
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,030
so where does it rank in my priorities?
I think it's it.

658
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,650
Sure it's an important thing,

659
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,350
but I think my general lifestyle aligns
with enough that I don't think about it

660
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,213
as much.

661
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:18,290
And I think overall living life is
more important to me than just living.

662
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,620
Yeah.
So it makes got to live life.

663
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,850
What if magic,
like a magic wizard guy says,

664
00:37:27,851 --> 00:37:32,470
I'm the gatekeeper of your whole life,
whatever your life and death situation,

665
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,930
he's a grim reaper. That's
what it was. And he said,

666
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:40,110
I know when you're gonna die,
you know you can't help it. This,

667
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,770
I just know the future,
whatever.

668
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:48,070
I will give you 20 extra years.
Right now you're,

669
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,030
you know, 40 something years old, the day
you're going to die, whatever that is.

670
00:37:52,031 --> 00:37:55,210
I can't tell you that.
Maybe 90 maybe 80 whatever,

671
00:37:55,270 --> 00:38:00,270
but I'll give you 20 more
years of fully functional life.

672
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,510
But you got to stop doing Jujitsu right
now. You can never do that ever again.

673
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:08,220
I'd probably choke him out.
Next question.

674
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:12,850
Otherwise you'd be just as functional.
You can laugh, you can surf, you can,

675
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,960
you know, you can get after it in, in
every other way. Just know Jujitsu.

676
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,550
No martial arts in any way.

677
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,810
You know what?
I would double leg him

678
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:26,640
and then I would pass his guard and
then I would choke him. Yeah, yeah,

679
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,010
makes sense. And I'd take his
sickle. Yeah. And I free the world.

680
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,100
Well,
a Jiu Jitsu life is

681
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,960
not life.
That's what you're saying.

682
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,880
I think the minute you start restraining
yourself from doing things that you

683
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:46,720
want to do, you would need to take serious
considerations in what you're doing.

684
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,321
Yeah.
Yeah.

685
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:51,940
I also think that hypothetical questions
like that are completely ridiculous.

686
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:55,510
No, they're not. They're
mental exercise. So my,

687
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:00,370
that's why then in that case I will stay
with my first answer. Yeah, I agree.

688
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,480
If the grim reaper came to me and made
me an offer, I would double leg him.

689
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:08,190
I would take him down and I would joke,
I'm out. There you go. I might kill him.

690
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:12,670
Yeah, I might kill Beth.
Yeah, there you go. See Boom.

691
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,670
And you can't do that without you just
do so as far as the double leg and

692
00:39:15,671 --> 00:39:18,800
choking someone up. So back to your, um,

693
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:23,530
how do you say how the longevity thing,
it didn't know about that actually.

694
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,500
Yeah.
And it,

695
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,720
and it makes sense cause that's a lot
of things like if you want to be the

696
00:39:28,721 --> 00:39:31,450
safest you possibly can in
life, right. The same thing.

697
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:34,960
You can just get to live in a bubble
with no threats of any disease,

698
00:39:34,961 --> 00:39:39,160
sterilized bubble, no murders,
no car accidents, no nothing,

699
00:39:39,161 --> 00:39:42,490
never drive, never do anything. The
same thing. Well, you'll be so safe,

700
00:39:42,491 --> 00:39:44,810
you'll be the safest person
in the world. Really. Yeah.

701
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:49,790
But as far as quote unquote living life,
you know, you go one day out in the,

702
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:52,840
in the wild, all you're dead. Same thing.

703
00:39:52,841 --> 00:39:57,010
Like if you restrict all your calories,
no hard physical activity,

704
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:01,750
no son, you know, all this stuff.
The moment you go to everyday life,

705
00:40:01,751 --> 00:40:05,410
which is physical in some is less
waste than before, but still physical.

706
00:40:05,411 --> 00:40:08,920
There's Sun, there's days when you go
out there all year. That's right son.

707
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:13,680
All or nothing. Yeah. Take
Vitamin D pills. The uh,

708
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,720
the other thing is with calorie
restriction is I think, and you know,

709
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:18,570
I'm reading about this
stuff all the time and,

710
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:23,050
but you can get a lot of those benefits
by doing some intermittent fast for sure.

711
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:27,670
Yeah. And you will feel good on the
intermittent fasting. Yeah. 24, 48,

712
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,780
72 hours.
That's the most I've done is you know,

713
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:35,500
and maybe I'll do some more in the future.
Tim Ferriss did like seven days.

714
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:39,490
Okay. I want you to actually,
you know, I dunno man.

715
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:45,070
Yeah, yeah. But in c and that's it.
That almost goes into a whole, honestly,

716
00:40:45,071 --> 00:40:48,070
when I did 72 hours the last
time I did it the same thing.

717
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:50,830
I've done it a couple of times
now. Every time I feel fine. Yeah.

718
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:54,700
I don't feel any of this stuff that
people talk about. Yeah. Well yeah.

719
00:40:54,701 --> 00:40:58,720
So I mean it's, this is almost even,
I feel hungry for a little while,

720
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:04,350
but I do, I wasn't like, Oh God. Right.
Who wasn't going to die? No, you were.

721
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,650
No, but you're talking about
a whole different thing.

722
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,133
If people are going to say,

723
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:15,390
people are gonna ask on the interwebs
to talk more about intermittent fasting.

724
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:19,450
No, don't ask me. There's like
actual research out there.

725
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:23,980
Go and Google it. Look up and harassed
fasting and read about it. Don't ask me,

726
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:28,690
I'm the wrong person to ask. You.
Ask Smart People. Yeah. And again,

727
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,890
that intermittent fast,

728
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:33,980
like if you're talking about
like did like 10,000 questions

729
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,450
on Twitter because it's true,

730
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:40,130
don't ask me Google it and look at
these really good research paper.

731
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:42,350
There's all kinds of stuff
coming out about it right now.

732
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:47,030
Now what's weird about the Internet
and science in general is in,

733
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:50,810
you know, there's a one
article that says it's great,

734
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:53,200
you can find two more articles
that say it's horrible.

735
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:55,280
You can find three more articles.
So you can always count on

736
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:59,130
everything. Yeah. I mean,
although the have to split hairs,

737
00:41:59,131 --> 00:42:03,120
but that's not necessarily
about science in general.

738
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:08,121
It's more about a specific person's
viewpoint based on what they've k yeah,

739
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:12,600
for sure. For sure. Um, and especially
with diet and health, it's so,

740
00:42:12,601 --> 00:42:15,990
it's so ambiguous and so
adaptable and stuff like that. So,

741
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:18,570
but if you're talking about
fasting, that's, that's,

742
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:20,610
you're talking about something different.

743
00:42:20,611 --> 00:42:24,930
Like people fast for a specific reason
or even that kind of a general reason,

744
00:42:24,931 --> 00:42:29,931
but it's like fascinating alone isn't
going to make you achieve whatever it is

745
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:33,720
you're doing. You know, it's a complete,
just like lifting, like with lifting,

746
00:42:33,721 --> 00:42:35,510
you need nutrition,
you need rest,

747
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,190
you need all this stuff for a specific
results and then there's all kinds of

748
00:42:38,191 --> 00:42:40,680
different lifting, you know? So
you can't just be like, oh yeah,

749
00:42:40,681 --> 00:42:44,610
I want bigger muscles so I'm just
gonna lift. That's it. No nutrition,

750
00:42:44,611 --> 00:42:47,730
I'm not going to eat at all or no rest,
I'm not going to rest at all.

751
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:52,970
So the point there is when you go try
and live as long as you possibly can,

752
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:59,190
it's like you have to like that has to
be the objective just to live everything

753
00:42:59,191 --> 00:43:03,240
else is, everything else is
out the window. So you, yeah,

754
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,980
I don't, I agree with you. I don't
think that that's living necessarily.

755
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,380
I don't think there's too many people
that are just on the full on lung

756
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,310
longevity Gig. But there are
some, yeah, I know, I know one,

757
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:18,900
I'm not going to mention his name.
Check I guess would be your little secret.

758
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:22,920
Next question.

759
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:31,050
Similar question. Yeah.
Jocko, prioritize and execute.

760
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:36,090
Is it wrong to sacrifice health in short
term to accomplish work objectives and

761
00:43:36,091 --> 00:43:37,200
how would you make up

762
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,280
the time lost? So yeah, absolutely.

763
00:43:40,281 --> 00:43:44,270
Sometimes you have to sacrifice
workouts for health and health for work

764
00:43:44,271 --> 00:43:44,870
objectives.

765
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:49,870
There's no doubt that's the life
and work in many respects his life.

766
00:43:50,751 --> 00:43:55,010
And that's kind of another topic.
But try and love what you're doing,

767
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:57,440
trying to enjoy your job if you don't,

768
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:01,910
because if you enjoy
your job then work is,

769
00:44:01,911 --> 00:44:05,950
life is an okay thing. If you hate
your job, then work is, life is not a,

770
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,580
is not a good situation to be in.

771
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,680
So try and get into things and do
something that you enjoy doing and if you

772
00:44:12,681 --> 00:44:15,590
don't enjoy it, you know, find
some kind of an exit strategy.

773
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:19,100
But that's another topic.
Going back to this topic,

774
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:24,170
is it okay or is it wrong to sacrifice
your health and the short term to

775
00:44:24,171 --> 00:44:26,660
accomplish long term
work objectives and yeah,

776
00:44:26,661 --> 00:44:30,920
even in the seal teams we did
that all kinds of times a lot.

777
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:34,110
Whether it was in training or for mission,

778
00:44:34,111 --> 00:44:39,111
where our priority or our mission or our
training takes priority over workouts

779
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,870
and over eating healthy
and over everything.

780
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,820
So there's times where a hundred percent
focused on some kind of mission and

781
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:51,780
that's what you're going to, that's
what you're going to do and that's okay.

782
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:54,210
That's what we did in the seal teams
and that's what everyone does and it's,

783
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:57,060
and when you get done with that,
how do you make up for lost time?

784
00:44:57,061 --> 00:45:00,060
You do some hard workouts and
maybe you go eat super clean,

785
00:45:00,061 --> 00:45:02,850
are you fast for a little
while or whatever it is
that gets you back on track,

786
00:45:02,851 --> 00:45:07,230
you just get yourself back on track. What
you have to watch out for is a pattern,

787
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:13,690
a long term pattern where work takes
precedent over health for multiple weeks,

788
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:23,550
right? Multiple weeks and
months, right? If it's,

789
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:26,100
if you're talking about months,
we're in a bad situation. Like,

790
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:28,710
if you go week two weeks where
you just were crazy and work,

791
00:45:28,711 --> 00:45:30,570
it was crazy and you, you know, you know,

792
00:45:30,571 --> 00:45:34,590
your health took a little to went down
a couple notches on the priority and a

793
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:36,000
couple of weeks goes by and
you cook food with, I'm God,

794
00:45:36,001 --> 00:45:40,110
I'm God through that and the, the, the
hard seasons over or the whatever the,

795
00:45:40,111 --> 00:45:41,400
you know, like, you know,

796
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,820
people in the finance world and taxis and
they're just busting their ass for two,

797
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:49,800
three, four straight weeks. It's really
hard. It's understandable. And you know,

798
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,570
uh, retail people around Christmas
time, there were, you know,

799
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,420
everyone's got their
little cyclical things,

800
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:57,240
real estate people in the springtime
and the summer starts rolling around in

801
00:45:57,241 --> 00:46:01,140
their work. It's, it's, they're
cyclical things and that's cool.

802
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:04,830
You work hard for two, three weeks
where you just have to get after it.

803
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,800
But when that starts turning into months
in and multiple weeks and then months

804
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:15,210
and then six months of your
health is taking the backseat,

805
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:19,710
we have an issue. Now, that being said,

806
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:24,950
there are not too many jobs that consume
23 and a half hours a day of your time.

807
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:33,750
They're just not that many jobs that do
that now and what you might be facing

808
00:46:33,751 --> 00:46:37,680
here as you might be blaming
your job for you being lazy,

809
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,370
that that can be happening.
That's a strong possibility actually,

810
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:46,410
because you can make time for
a 20 minute workout, right?

811
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,800
20 minute workout, right? 20
minute work. I'd like that.

812
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:53,850
If you get 20 minutes, you get in there,
shake it out a little bit and you do.

813
00:46:53,851 --> 00:46:57,540
But you know, couple hundred
burpees go as hard as you can.

814
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:02,400
You just got to workout that took
you 10 1520 minutes. Right? Well,

815
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:06,340
longer than that for me, but yeah. You
see what I'm saying though? I do. Yes.

816
00:47:06,341 --> 00:47:10,770
Fully you d and then if you can do that
for you, sprint, if you do 10 sprints,

817
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:14,690
right, it doesn't take you much time.
You do go, go knock out three, four,

818
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:18,180
five sets of pullups.
Go knock out a couple of hundred pullups.

819
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:22,350
How long does that take? It
doesn't take that long. Right?

820
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,990
Take you 15 minutes,
you're done.

821
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:28,770
So then maybe at night
you just roll up there,

822
00:47:28,771 --> 00:47:30,850
you grab your Kettlebell and
you knock out some swings.

823
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:34,090
It takes you seven minutes.
We're not talking about a bunch of times.

824
00:47:34,091 --> 00:47:39,091
So are we being lazy cause we're
not carving out 1520 minutes,

825
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:40,924
half an hour.

826
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:43,510
You know a lot of people ask me about
what the workouts I do when I'm on the

827
00:47:43,511 --> 00:47:46,660
road. A lot of times when I'm
on the road, I fly into a city.

828
00:47:46,661 --> 00:47:48,450
I'd get there at 11 o'clock
at night the next time,

829
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,300
next day I'm working with a company at
eight o'clock in the morning and so my

830
00:47:52,301 --> 00:47:54,760
schedule is tight. Why am I in
the hotel room? The hotel room,

831
00:47:54,761 --> 00:47:59,761
Jim's sucks for one thing and I'm
going to bang something out quickly.

832
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:03,310
You know it's not going
to be an hour workout. No,

833
00:48:03,311 --> 00:48:05,020
it's going to be like
20 minutes sometimes.

834
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,580
Now sometimes if I have
a little extra time,

835
00:48:06,581 --> 00:48:09,550
maybe I'm not meeting with
the company until lunch. Cool.

836
00:48:09,551 --> 00:48:12,790
I'm going to have a nice long
workout of course, but if it's,

837
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:17,560
I'm due to meet with the CEO for breakfast
at seven o'clock it's going to be a

838
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:22,300
quick hardcore 12 minute
workout and that's cool.

839
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:27,260
So you got to carve that out.
And so you know,

840
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:32,280
make sure that it's the job that's doing
this to you and not you that's doing

841
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:34,610
this to you.
Yeah.

842
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:39,490
So if it is your job,
truly,

843
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:44,980
truly your job is the thing that's making
you unhealthy, then you got to fix it.

844
00:48:44,981 --> 00:48:49,060
Now what you have going for you is that
companies want you to be healthy, right?

845
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:52,960
Companies understand the benefit
of having healthy employees,

846
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:57,580
not just from a productivity standpoint,
but from like an insurance viewpoint.

847
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:59,380
We, if we got to, you know,

848
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,830
we've got a health coverage for our
employees and all of our employees are our

849
00:49:02,831 --> 00:49:06,880
sick and lame and lazy and we're having
to pay their medical bills and they

850
00:49:06,881 --> 00:49:09,820
can't work. It's problematic. So what
you do is you step up and you say, Hey,

851
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:12,040
you know what? We don't have a health
and wellness program. I want to run it.

852
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:16,960
We need a little gym. Oh yeah,
it's going to cost money. Yes,

853
00:49:16,961 --> 00:49:19,330
it's going to cost money, but I'm going
to save you money and productivity.

854
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,940
I'm gonna Save you money and insurance.
I'm going to write a point paper on that.

855
00:49:21,941 --> 00:49:24,250
I'm gonna win that one all day long.
We're going to,

856
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:29,290
we're going to put a gym in the
lounge and we're going to put,

857
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:33,040
we're going to put some mats in the
donut room. You know what I'm saying?

858
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:37,120
So we're going to, we're going to do it
when I think linkedin has a Jujitsu room.

859
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,770
You mean like the headquarter?

860
00:49:39,771 --> 00:49:43,180
I think I saw a picture of they have
a Jujitsu Room. Good idea. Yeah.

861
00:49:43,181 --> 00:49:46,410
You didn't even have to pay me to work
there. So you've got Jujitsu room boy.

862
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:51,190
Free memory. Yeah. So you
get so, so go, you know,

863
00:49:51,191 --> 00:49:55,150
step up your company. I can
about guarantee your company
wants you to be healthy.

864
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:57,550
So step up,

865
00:49:57,551 --> 00:50:02,410
maybe take a leadership role in forming
the health and wellness program for your

866
00:50:02,411 --> 00:50:06,760
company. Get flooding. My,
uh, my brother's company.

867
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:09,660
You know it up. He, uh, he,

868
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:14,670
they don't have then on Mattson
everything in the office but yet yet yet,

869
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:19,570
but are working. Um, it's funny though,
he'll, he'll like, he'll do this,

870
00:50:19,571 --> 00:50:22,180
he'll encourage people to go to Jujitsu,
you know,

871
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:25,090
to the point where they
have rash guards even. Yeah.

872
00:50:25,091 --> 00:50:28,080
We have a pretty good representation
from frag at the gym. Yeah.

873
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,510
You don't, I call everyone from
frag mom that trains, you know,

874
00:50:30,511 --> 00:50:34,100
and I had nicknamed them, well all of
them frack mob. Hey removed from frag mob.

875
00:50:34,101 --> 00:50:39,080
That's America. That's their actual name
Jim Anymore? No, your name is frank mob.

876
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:40,123
Yeah.

877
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:44,140
But that's good because it becomes this
culture that kind of catches on where,

878
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:45,270
and this is just,
you're just so,

879
00:50:45,271 --> 00:50:48,620
it can be kind of anything crossfit
or even spin, I dunno, whatever.

880
00:50:48,621 --> 00:50:52,310
But you is kind of good cause it's one
of those ones that you can kind of come

881
00:50:52,311 --> 00:50:53,600
and talk about it and you know,

882
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:55,730
choked you out or you
choked me out kind of thing.

883
00:50:55,731 --> 00:50:58,010
You can choke your boss if he's there,
you know, it's like that kind of stuff.

884
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:01,310
It's really fun. Your boss. And they even
have like rat, like I said, rash guards,

885
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:05,960
the rash guards. Like if you work for
fragment, it'll say staff on the back.

886
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,300
It'll have, uh, like, you know,

887
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:12,890
they do like AI and development,
stuff like that. So the,

888
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:17,060
the staff one will be, um, what does
it have on the sleeves? Like digital,

889
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:21,620
digital circuitry. Yeah. And then the
other one says, we'll say security.

890
00:51:21,621 --> 00:51:22,251
That's like,
you know,

891
00:51:22,251 --> 00:51:26,990
friends of friends or the friction
between the hardware and the software rash

892
00:51:26,991 --> 00:51:29,730
guard. That's what I mean. That's
exactly what it is. So the soft,

893
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,290
the guys who actually worked
for a fragment have the
software rash guards that

894
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:37,370
has like circuitry and the design and then
the, the, you know, the hardware. Oh no,

895
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:42,350
sorry. This software is
zeros and ones. Yes, exactly.

896
00:51:42,351 --> 00:51:45,770
And the security guys who were,
anyway, nonetheless, that's kind of,

897
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:51,850
that's like a good cause that's not really
an official program in fragment or in

898
00:51:52,701 --> 00:51:56,000
a company. It's just, it's kind of the
influential element of the culture.

899
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,130
You know where it's like, and you know
my brother, he, he, he, he pushed that,

900
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:04,040
you know, kind of overtly I
guess, but it's more, it was like,

901
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:06,200
you guys have to do this. It's kind
of like, hey, you should come down.

902
00:52:06,201 --> 00:52:09,080
I'll give you a rash guard and okay,
cool. And guys, and it was funny.

903
00:52:09,081 --> 00:52:12,020
There's a time, there's a bunch of
fragmented people in there just going.

904
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,870
Interesting. But yeah, that
helps. That does help for sure.

905
00:52:14,871 --> 00:52:17,360
Now the thing is if none of that works,
if you,

906
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:21,470
if your company's just dragging you down
and you've checked and double checked

907
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:26,471
and triple checked your own discipline
or lack of discipline and you realize

908
00:52:27,921 --> 00:52:31,610
that it's the work that is bringing
down your health, in that case,

909
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,610
you got to follow the procedure.
You've got to find an exit strategy,

910
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:39,440
create an exit strategy, save
up your money, line things up,

911
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:43,100
get the ducks in a row in the next queue
because your health is going to be more

912
00:52:43,101 --> 00:52:46,910
important than everything else.
Yeah. Then everything else,

913
00:52:46,911 --> 00:52:48,800
all that money you could possibly make.

914
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,080
If you've got to sacrifice
a year and a half,

915
00:52:51,081 --> 00:52:53,960
two years and you're going to grind it
out like an investment banker that shows

916
00:52:53,961 --> 00:52:54,980
up on Wall Street,

917
00:52:54,981 --> 00:52:56,870
he's going to grind for two years
and their health is going to suffer,

918
00:52:56,990 --> 00:53:00,170
but they've got a goal at the end of that.
Hey understood you.

919
00:53:00,171 --> 00:53:04,580
Sometimes you've got to do, but you got to
at the end of that two, three years, he,

920
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:04,921
if you,

921
00:53:04,921 --> 00:53:07,850
and if you're not there and you're not
where you want to be and you're starting

922
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:08,840
to decline in health,

923
00:53:08,841 --> 00:53:10,610
they're going to get some stuff that
you won't be able to recover from.

924
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:14,150
So make your,
make your decision.

925
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:18,710
Then you come up with an exit strategy
and move on. Do something else. Yeah,

926
00:53:18,711 --> 00:53:23,300
and health,
health and even like fitness is,

927
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,280
is this thing,
it's called systemic

928
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:29,400
versus direct, you know,
as far as being beneficial.

929
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:34,460
So exercise is like one of the few things
in your little hierarchy of needs or

930
00:53:35,401 --> 00:53:40,260
whatever that affects
everything else. Like if you,

931
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,630
if you're an unhealthy person
versus a healthy person,

932
00:53:42,631 --> 00:53:44,880
a healthy person will be
better at everything else.

933
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:48,720
He'll be better at making money.
He'll be better at all relationships.

934
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:52,290
He'll be better off.
Obviously health wise in and of itself.

935
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:57,500
I mean obviously if you've got some guy
that's brilliant and really out of shape

936
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,960
versus a guy that's an
idiot who's in great shape,

937
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:04,830
the brilliant person's probably going
to make more money and do better in the

938
00:54:04,831 --> 00:54:05,570
long run.
I mean,

939
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:08,650
I were talking and you have to put them
on a level and intellectual playing for,

940
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:10,940
yeah, you're talking about
the same person. Yeah.

941
00:54:10,941 --> 00:54:13,980
Then for sure for sure for your
person and wasn't going to win,

942
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,970
but so and compare that to the direct
thing like, well, people would be like,

943
00:54:17,971 --> 00:54:20,820
hey mate, making money's important. So
it's more important than the health.

944
00:54:20,821 --> 00:54:22,710
But his thing,
making money doesn't improve your health.

945
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:27,000
Making money doesn't necessarily improve
friendship or romantic relationships

946
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:30,150
necessarily. In fact, a lot of times
it damages them. A lot of the times.

947
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:32,730
Health doesn't damage anything.
It improves everything.

948
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:38,150
There's not anything that I can think
of anyway that health makes worse.

949
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:43,400
Yeah. Or being more fit and makes
worse. Get healthy. Stay healthy. Yeah.

950
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:45,390
Stay on the program. You know what? Um,

951
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:49,560
and it's one of those things to men like
working out when you're on the road,

952
00:54:49,561 --> 00:54:50,341
that's a big one,
right?

953
00:54:50,341 --> 00:54:52,920
It's hard to like get a solid workout
on the road because you're busy or

954
00:54:52,921 --> 00:54:56,850
whatever. But there's, this is going to
sound crazy but when you think about it,

955
00:54:56,851 --> 00:54:59,540
it's not, not crazy but sound
kind of unrealistic where, okay,

956
00:54:59,541 --> 00:55:02,550
so this is what I've been doing recently
when we went to New York for the muster

957
00:55:02,551 --> 00:55:04,350
and like all these other,
some before I go,

958
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:08,400
I'll research Jujitsu gyms and
fitness gyms where it can work out.

959
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,170
Cause like you said,
the hotel gym is like,

960
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,960
if you don't have anything else in yet
but you still have time, okay good.

961
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:17,190
But our research, where are the
gyms and prepare like, okay,

962
00:55:17,191 --> 00:55:20,250
how long is it going to take me to get
their workout, get back all this stuff.

963
00:55:20,251 --> 00:55:22,530
And then you fit it in your
schedule and you know the thing.

964
00:55:22,531 --> 00:55:24,420
If you don't want to fit in your schedule,
then don't work out.

965
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:28,880
Then if been health is not for you then,
but if you're like, oh, you're asking,

966
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:33,950
you know this kind of question where
you know is it wrong to sacrifice health

967
00:55:35,371 --> 00:55:37,710
and all this stuff,
that means you're concerned about health.

968
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,350
Then be concerned about health.
You can fit it in there.

969
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,700
Surprised what you can fit in.

970
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:45,540
Just like you don't have to get that good
of a workout but you're fitting it in.

971
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:47,880
But here's the thing,
you can fit in a good workout.

972
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:51,240
You just got to make room for that and
you've got a psychological when too,

973
00:55:51,241 --> 00:55:52,190
like I,

974
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:56,520
if I'm going to speak
somewhere at a minimum,

975
00:55:56,790 --> 00:56:00,030
I'll do a couple a hundred burpees before
I go before I went to wake up because

976
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:02,520
that just gets the blood flow and
you're ready to rock and roll.

977
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:06,900
But at the muster I,
there was no break in the program.

978
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,220
I went to 24 hour fitness.

979
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:12,090
I've rolled a hard one and hands those
and then we rolled out at the muster,

980
00:56:12,091 --> 00:56:13,110
which wasn't hard necessarily,

981
00:56:13,111 --> 00:56:16,470
but there's a lot of roles
in there and so man it was,

982
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,390
there was no break in the program,

983
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:23,350
but the point is because I knew
that that was the I, I made time.

984
00:56:23,351 --> 00:56:23,980
Exactly right.
It

985
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,980
was important and I don't want to say
it's important like it's the number one

986
00:56:26,981 --> 00:56:30,640
priority. I'm saying it's part
of the, the whole what I'm doing.

987
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:33,100
If it's not part of what you're
doing and then don't be healthy,

988
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:36,040
then don't make it part of what you're
doing. I vote against you on that one.

989
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:40,540
I say make time. Be Healthy. Yeah,
I think so too. That's my opinion.

990
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:44,710
But I'm saying you help
people like I don't have time.

991
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,950
My job is so whatever. Hey, if
you straight up don't have time,

992
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:50,670
then you don't have time. Help is up
for you. You chose everything else.

993
00:56:50,671 --> 00:56:54,190
When we're healthy and that's up to you
wasn't going to go ahead and go in on a

994
00:56:54,191 --> 00:56:57,070
limb here that most people you
can make time. That's the point.

995
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:00,430
That's my weak point half
hour earlier because you know,

996
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:04,720
you know when you really don't have time.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like one time,

997
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:09,800
I don't know, two or three months
ago we were, we came in and we,

998
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:13,420
we skipped Jujitsu to record
the podcast and I was like, man,

999
00:57:13,421 --> 00:57:16,570
we skipped Jujitsu to record. The primary
is good. We had no choice. It was like,

1000
00:57:16,571 --> 00:57:17,171
we didn't do that.

1001
00:57:17,171 --> 00:57:21,190
We weren't going to get on a flight in
the afternoon and we just had to do it.

1002
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:25,990
And so, yeah. Okay. Actually
that those things happen.
Yeah. So consider that. Right.

1003
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,910
So it's either skipped,

1004
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:32,740
you'd get to one day and get the podcast
out or don't do it. We could either,

1005
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:37,570
we could have chosen, trained Jujitsu,
don't do the podcast. But at that point,

1006
00:57:37,571 --> 00:57:40,060
given all the circumstances,
the podcast at one day,

1007
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,350
it's keeping you to just do a one day.

1008
00:57:41,351 --> 00:57:44,200
It's more important for that one day
because it's not like we're giving up

1009
00:57:44,201 --> 00:57:45,580
Jujitsu completely for this,

1010
00:57:45,581 --> 00:57:48,760
but it's not that are actually holding
the line with a podcast. Exactly. Right.

1011
00:57:48,761 --> 00:57:52,600
And that was important that day because
we were kind of faced with that thing.

1012
00:57:52,601 --> 00:57:55,630
What do you give up? So what, that's
the question. What do you give up?

1013
00:57:55,840 --> 00:58:00,160
Do you give up watching
a movie and room service?

1014
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:03,310
Do you give that up? Give that US
give that up. Like I said, hey,

1015
00:58:03,311 --> 00:58:04,870
if you don't have to ask,
we don't want to go to hotels.

1016
00:58:04,871 --> 00:58:09,520
I don't even turn on the TV.
Yeah you cause I don't have TV at home.

1017
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:10,690
And so I don't know,

1018
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:15,370
a year or two ago I went to some hotel
and I've turned on the TV and next thing

1019
00:58:15,371 --> 00:58:16,204
I know,

1020
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:20,830
you know an hour and a half went by and
I was watching some movie from 1986 this

1021
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:24,940
is going, you've gotta be kidding me. Turn
it off. And you know what I always do?

1022
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:29,230
I hang my chalk bag on the TV. That's
my, as my standard operating procedure,

1023
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:33,250
I hang my child. Cause you know how
they're all the thin TVs when you travel?

1024
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,100
When I travel. So you bring
your chocolates? Yes. Chalk bag.

1025
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:40,270
I bring sweat bands for my wrists
because I sweat, I bring a chalk bag,

1026
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,410
I bring my little notebook,

1027
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:46,730
I brings good on mobility wad
ball to do some mobility work.

1028
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:53,140
And I bring some one inch tubular
nylon that I used to stretch.

1029
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:54,950
Oh that's right.
You're a good team.

1030
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,390
Like when we went to the
muster I brought rings with me

1031
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:02,020
cause I knew I was gonna
be on a tight timeline.

1032
00:59:02,021 --> 00:59:05,860
I knew I was going to have to get some
workouts done and I traveled a little bit

1033
00:59:05,861 --> 00:59:08,950
heavier. Yeah. Cause I
normally travel really light.

1034
00:59:08,951 --> 00:59:12,970
But I had an extra bag so then
no rings. Amen. No factor.

1035
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:14,160
You were there for a while too.

1036
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:18,400
A couple of weeks I was in Austria and
then came back to New York and then from

1037
00:59:18,401 --> 00:59:22,120
New York to Texas. So there
was a road trip. Yeah. Dang.

1038
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:25,670
See and you made it happen and you're
busier than the normal person in my

1039
00:59:25,671 --> 00:59:30,530
opinion. Kind of busy in
from, yeah. But again man,

1040
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:34,100
I think you know how that
old saying I think, I dunno,

1041
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:36,950
you might've said it might have been
Henry. I don't know where I saw it,

1042
00:59:36,951 --> 00:59:41,630
but it's like there is no free time
or spare time or you know, worked at,

1043
00:59:41,631 --> 00:59:44,500
there's just time. You know,
it's, it's one of those Rollins,

1044
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,010
so it's like time. So there's no
spare time. There's no free time.

1045
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,860
There's just like this time. Yeah.
So you better just get on it.

1046
00:59:51,861 --> 00:59:53,480
So unless you're like Peter,

1047
00:59:53,481 --> 00:59:56,090
a tear member when he was talking about
what Peter Theo was talking about,

1048
00:59:56,091 --> 00:59:59,090
like there is no time.
You're just working the whole time.

1049
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:01,610
Like you can't even sleep
when he's at med school.

1050
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:04,820
So if you're in that situation,
the, then that makes sense.

1051
01:00:04,821 --> 01:00:05,990
You're not going to be like,
Hey,

1052
01:00:05,991 --> 01:00:09,260
I'm not doing this part of my
med medical program here though.

1053
01:00:09,261 --> 01:00:12,560
You can put that on the side of the road
to a park to fall asleep for an hour

1054
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:16,490
because you hadn't slept the nine days.
Yeah. So there are exceptions for sure.

1055
01:00:16,491 --> 01:00:20,960
But again, like if you're doing
room service or you're, you know,

1056
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:24,890
you're watching the game or you're
stopping at the bar or doing anything,

1057
01:00:24,891 --> 01:00:26,780
I'm not even saying
necessarily destructive things.

1058
01:00:26,781 --> 01:00:30,710
I'm just saying things that
aren't conducive to your
quote unquote work that's

1059
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:33,350
keeping you so busy or
whatever that are essential.

1060
01:00:33,351 --> 01:00:36,980
If you're doing these other things,
then there's where you can make time.

1061
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:41,450
How can one ever have time if
you don't take time? I like it.

1062
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:45,463
Next question.

1063
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:50,330
My wife and kids are quick to anger.

1064
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:55,570
Sometimes it's explosive like
the Moab mother of all bombs.

1065
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,210
Other times it's a slow
grinding war of attrition.

1066
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,830
Being a student of your podcast,

1067
01:01:00,831 --> 01:01:04,520
I've learned the worst strategy is to
directly attack there to fight emotional

1068
01:01:04,521 --> 01:01:05,354
position.

1069
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:09,200
It seems like this is a good opportunity
to employ the flanking maneuver.

1070
01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:14,750
How do I effectively flank their
anger without appearing weak?

1071
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:18,050
Okay. First of all, thank yourself
cause at a period week thing,

1072
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,240
that's pretty much in your head.
Really it is.

1073
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:23,180
It's legitimately in your head and
that's the first thing you need to do.

1074
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:26,570
That's your ego talking when you
don't want to, when you don't want to,

1075
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:30,740
when they hit you with
something that they're angry at,

1076
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:33,920
the thing that's hitting back his ego,
that's what's hitting back.

1077
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:35,720
So first thing you got to do is,
okay,

1078
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,330
I'm going to check my ego right now
because I'm going to win the long war.

1079
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:43,040
In fact,
you have to be careful when you stay calm,

1080
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:44,480
when everyone else is angry.

1081
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:49,900
You have to actually be careful not
to come across as aloof or arrogant.

1082
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:55,130
Yeah, yeah. Like when people are getting
mad, okay, here. Okay. For instance,

1083
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:58,940
if your wife is super mad about something
and you show no emotions and you don't

1084
01:01:58,941 --> 01:02:03,530
get mad at all, they get matter. So that's
right. You don't even care about this,

1085
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:07,250
you know, so, no, no. So you've got to,
you've got to give a little bit, you know,

1086
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:12,110
I'm not saying it a little bit of a,
I get it.

1087
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:16,700
Right. But then we're trying to do is
absorb. Oh, they want to get mad, cool.

1088
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:20,070
Absorb. Take the screaming.
Give the head nod of

1089
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:25,070
understanding in a Ma only
marginally emotional way.

1090
01:02:25,201 --> 01:02:28,820
That pretty much communicates that.
I understand. You're mad at him.

1091
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:31,350
I'm listening and I hear
you. You know, I get it.

1092
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:35,340
And let them get it out of their system.
This, let them get it. Honor system.

1093
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:36,810
Then let them calm down.

1094
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:42,170
And then after you've given them the time
to kind of calm down and settle down,

1095
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,110
and I mean it's a longer than you think.
It's,

1096
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:52,920
it's longer than you think. Let them
let, let, when you think they're calm,

1097
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:58,800
wait an extra 45 minutes if not two hours,
probably two hours,

1098
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:03,960
cause they're not called to be safe. They
just stopped screaming right there. So,

1099
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:08,580
and then what you do is, and then which
dudes, you're kind of take it on yourself.

1100
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:12,150
You're going to own it, right?
And you say something like, Hey,

1101
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:13,470
you know that thing that made you mad?

1102
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:15,280
I want to make sure it doesn't happen
again. Right. You know what can,

1103
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:18,600
what can I do better to make sure that
you don't get mad about that, right.

1104
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:20,700
You take,
you take ownership of that.

1105
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:25,950
What do I need to adjust
and what exactly is it that,

1106
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:28,470
that I did that frustrated.
What is it that frustrated you?

1107
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:31,650
What can I do to stop it? Maybe it wasn't
me. Maybe you're mad at the printer,

1108
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,770
but you know, how can we fix that?
Because I don't want you to do it.

1109
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,670
And then you know,
so you have the,

1110
01:03:36,671 --> 01:03:40,260
that kind of conversation and you know,

1111
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:44,220
you're going to slide something tactfully
and their tactfully, because again,

1112
01:03:44,221 --> 01:03:46,290
you're still dealing with like,
you know,

1113
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:51,390
possible flare up scenarios
happening. So you know, but,

1114
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:52,680
but you say something like that,
you know,

1115
01:03:52,681 --> 01:03:55,680
we both know that nobody benefits
when people lose their temper. Right?

1116
01:03:55,681 --> 01:03:58,890
I mean we gotta be
careful, you know, no one,

1117
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:01,710
it doesn't do us any good when people lose
their temper, we, everyone knows that.

1118
01:04:01,711 --> 01:04:03,090
Right?
So you slide those things in there.

1119
01:04:03,091 --> 01:04:08,091
You're given that kind of like a little
mini lecture indirectly about what's

1120
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:10,890
happening. And then when you
have other conversations,

1121
01:04:10,891 --> 01:04:13,950
now we're in just a normal day to day
thing. You drop things about temper,

1122
01:04:13,951 --> 01:04:16,080
you know, you talk about
tempurpedic, well, you know,

1123
01:04:16,081 --> 01:04:19,500
it's a weakness and it's no one makes
good decisions when they have them then

1124
01:04:19,501 --> 01:04:20,400
those are temporary,
everything.

1125
01:04:20,401 --> 01:04:22,710
And so some of the dumbest things I've
ever done was when I logged, you know,

1126
01:04:22,711 --> 01:04:23,640
everyone knows that.
But you know,

1127
01:04:23,641 --> 01:04:27,890
you say you start sliding those things
in there that it's bad for your decision

1128
01:04:27,891 --> 01:04:32,130
making. It's bad for relationships, it's
bad for your health, it's bad for life.

1129
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:35,100
And again,
you're not directly saying these things.

1130
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:38,310
You're subliminally saying even,
you know it's man.

1131
01:04:38,311 --> 01:04:41,520
I remember one time I lost some little
dumbest things I ever did when I lost my

1132
01:04:41,521 --> 01:04:44,970
temper and I kicked the wall and I
broke my toe and I bought a home,

1133
01:04:44,971 --> 01:04:49,470
a wall and the landlord came.
I, that's when I s man, I
hate when I lose my temper.

1134
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:55,010
And you start getting them in the,

1135
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,870
even thinking about it over time,
and this is the thing,

1136
01:04:57,871 --> 01:05:01,650
it's a long war and there's going
to be relapses along the way,

1137
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:06,090
but you got to just hold the line,
keep it steady,

1138
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:11,420
absorb and then flank gently to get them
to salt start self recognizing where

1139
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:17,160
they're at and what their
temperature does to him. [inaudible]

1140
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:22,030
tempers crazy. Yeah. You see
people lose their temper. It's,

1141
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:27,770
it's a total loss of control. Yeah. It's
a total loss of control and it's does,

1142
01:05:27,771 --> 01:05:28,960
it doesn't do anybody any good.

1143
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:32,260
And when you see someone that really
loses their temper, you're like,

1144
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:36,230
what is wrong? Come on. Yeah.

1145
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:39,760
And when I was a kid and I used to
lose my temper and at some point I just

1146
01:05:39,761 --> 01:05:41,320
realized,
I forget what it was.

1147
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,530
I forget what made me think there
was something my dad said to me,

1148
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:49,030
there's something about, you know,
something along those lines of like,

1149
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:54,220
you lose your temper. It's like a
little baby. Oh, loss of control. Okay.

1150
01:05:54,221 --> 01:05:58,420
So you, you, when you realized it, that's
because of something my dad said to me.

1151
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:00,580
Something along the lines of light,
you know,

1152
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:03,160
I think he was referring
to an athlete or something,

1153
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:06,500
someone that just had no emotions
and how that was impressive. Yeah.

1154
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:11,540
And I was like, hmm, that is
impressive. Massive control over that.

1155
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:16,270
Nothing is going to make me mad. It
doesn't matter what's going on around me.

1156
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:21,070
Yeah. Yeah. It is like a baby,
you know? Like I said, it'd
be, you know, like babies,

1157
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:23,890
they cry and they whatever,
cause they don't know how to talk.

1158
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:28,060
So if they knew how to talk and control
everything, they just be like, hey,

1159
01:06:28,061 --> 01:06:31,180
I'm cold. Or Hey, I'm hungry,
but they don't know how to talk.

1160
01:06:31,181 --> 01:06:33,880
So why do adults go crazy and cry?
Because their babies,

1161
01:06:33,881 --> 01:06:36,490
cause they don't know how to talk if they,
if they die for every little thing,

1162
01:06:36,491 --> 01:06:39,130
they're babies. Yeah. They don't know how
to talk. I said actually you know what,

1163
01:06:39,790 --> 01:06:41,650
under any,
depends.

1164
01:06:41,651 --> 01:06:45,010
It depends how much controlling and
all these other little variables.

1165
01:06:45,011 --> 01:06:47,320
But it's like the front part of your
brain. That's the decision making.

1166
01:06:47,321 --> 01:06:48,670
Like the conscious like,
oh I can't,

1167
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:51,570
I'm going to make this dis
this conscious decision. Right.

1168
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:53,680
Which is the last part of your
brain to develop by the way.

1169
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:58,330
And it's like a conscious decision
making be the front frontal lobe cortex.

1170
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:59,250
You know,
something like this.

1171
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:03,580
And it happens and it fully
develops around age 25 by the way.

1172
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:08,740
So if you're (242) 032-0220 one and
all, and so put simply, it's like, okay,

1173
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,230
my actions not how do they
affect the future, you know,

1174
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:12,460
it's all in one way or another.

1175
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:16,870
It's going to be kind of surrounded on
that little premise, small little bro.

1176
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:20,260
So otherwise you're just
going not straight auto mode.

1177
01:07:20,261 --> 01:07:25,180
However your however you feel that's
going to influence, not totally control,

1178
01:07:25,181 --> 01:07:27,120
but that's the thing that's going
to influence your behaviors.

1179
01:07:27,121 --> 01:07:31,690
So Times of stress, your frontal
cortex start to shut down a little bit.

1180
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:34,420
Hunger shut down a little bit.
Uh,

1181
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:39,340
hormonal situations for guys and girls.
Oh, so you lose your temper more.

1182
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:42,760
That's where hangry comes from.
Hangry is one of them, you know,

1183
01:07:42,761 --> 01:07:43,960
and it's like all these things,

1184
01:07:43,961 --> 01:07:47,230
loss of empathy and loss of like all this
stuff where your decisions just aren't

1185
01:07:47,231 --> 01:07:52,030
that dope. Yeah. And so,
and when I say hormonal,

1186
01:07:52,031 --> 01:07:55,060
like that's why you get roid
rage. You know? Cause like guys,

1187
01:07:55,061 --> 01:07:58,300
if they're on steroids,
that's their hormones are up.

1188
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:01,990
Or girls pms scene. It's
like a real, you know,

1189
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:07,170
premenstrual syndrome. It's like
their hormones are all, so her,

1190
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:09,250
one time my wife started
when she was pregnant,

1191
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:11,380
she started crying during
an 18 and t commercial,

1192
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:15,970
Macula Jack Mood.
I

1193
01:08:16,110 --> 01:08:19,550
was like, oh my God, what's wrong with
her? Some of those are kind of sad.

1194
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:24,080
Emotional nonetheless, or why were
you crying during Hawaii? Five O man.

1195
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:29,720
Oh, telling me they're training.
They're trying to make it deep man,

1196
01:08:29,721 --> 01:08:32,710
that show you're watching them
nod anyway, nonetheless. Um,

1197
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:35,570
it's back to losing your temper and stuff.

1198
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:39,830
It is a week thing.
So it's kind of obvious,

1199
01:08:39,831 --> 01:08:42,530
especially from the outside to see
that look, you're losing your temper.

1200
01:08:42,531 --> 01:08:43,730
It's not cool.
And a lot of people,

1201
01:08:43,731 --> 01:08:47,300
they think it's cool because it
feels good when you're a little kid,

1202
01:08:47,301 --> 01:08:49,090
you respect it cause you see
someone lose their temper.

1203
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:53,260
It's like turning into superman. Right? I

1204
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:58,280
mean he's feared, but right. You're
not feared by you look stupid.

1205
01:08:59,570 --> 01:09:03,920
That's the message conveyed to your kiss.
Yeah. Losing your temper is stupid. Yeah.

1206
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:07,040
And Amen.
Some people there that you could tell,

1207
01:09:07,041 --> 01:09:09,260
they say that stuff with a
little bit of pride, you know,

1208
01:09:09,261 --> 01:09:12,140
it's just me and my temper quarterback
is going to get me in trouble.

1209
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:16,110
And they're all like, yeah,
you don't proud. I'm a hot
head man. That's like, oh me,

1210
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:20,690
that should be the guy. I wish I
didn't. That should be. If you say, Hey,

1211
01:09:20,691 --> 01:09:23,450
I just have a temper, that should
be the equivalent of you saying,

1212
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:26,810
I don't know how to read. It should
be that, hey, nothing wrong with it.

1213
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:30,140
You can get past it and
you know, whatever. I'm not
going to judge you for it,

1214
01:09:30,141 --> 01:09:32,770
but it's not good.
It's not a good state to be in boot.

1215
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:34,340
He's someone who can't
control your temper.

1216
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:37,760
Just like it's not a good state to be
in as a grown adult to not know how to

1217
01:09:37,761 --> 01:09:40,370
read no judgment,
but you solve that problem.

1218
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:42,830
That's a B.

1219
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:48,400
If you're having like if your kids have
a temper and they're easy to anger,

1220
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:52,700
it's because chances are,
I dunno everybody of course,

1221
01:09:52,701 --> 01:09:55,040
but chances are they
got it from the parents.

1222
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:58,130
Keep in mind you're one of those parents.
I'm not saying,

1223
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:03,170
I'm not saying that you have a temper.
I'm not saying you don't,

1224
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:08,030
but I am saying, sure kids have a
temporary, your wife as a temporary,

1225
01:10:08,031 --> 01:10:10,130
you got it.
Really honestly evaluate,

1226
01:10:10,131 --> 01:10:14,090
do I have a temper and
understand that cause the kids,

1227
01:10:14,091 --> 01:10:18,560
they're just these little seeds of
beings who were like, hey, how do I act?

1228
01:10:18,561 --> 01:10:22,010
I don't know how to act all act out. You
know, just how I feel. I'm going to cry.

1229
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:24,060
This is my default.
I'm just going to cry when something's,

1230
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:27,200
so you're saying the parents have a
temper and show that and act that way the

1231
01:10:27,201 --> 01:10:29,630
kids will learn it from you're
going to learn it. So there is some,

1232
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:32,750
there is something like genetic though I,
well maybe I guess it could,

1233
01:10:32,751 --> 01:10:35,510
we don't know if it's genetic or not
but there are some where you know the

1234
01:10:35,511 --> 01:10:39,650
father has a bad temper and then
the kid has a bad temper. Yeah.

1235
01:10:39,651 --> 01:10:41,480
But there's no temper gene.

1236
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:46,570
So what it is is there's a genetic
situation for sure that you're more apt to

1237
01:10:46,911 --> 01:10:51,890
not be able to control certain parts
of or not not be able to control but

1238
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:53,210
control less.
You know,

1239
01:10:53,211 --> 01:10:57,530
certain parts of your brain or chemistry
is going to make you lean towards

1240
01:10:57,531 --> 01:11:00,740
certain types of behavior, like impulsive
behavior or something like that.

1241
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:04,910
There is for sure. But
again, and when you're a kid,

1242
01:11:04,911 --> 01:11:08,060
you're just looking for how do I
act? I don't know. I'm growing up.

1243
01:11:08,061 --> 01:11:09,020
I don't even know how to act.

1244
01:11:09,021 --> 01:11:11,990
So the first thing you're going to look
at is the people might be authority

1245
01:11:11,991 --> 01:11:13,890
figures in front of you,
the parents,

1246
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:16,200
if the parents aren't there, who
are they looking to? I don't know.

1247
01:11:16,201 --> 01:11:19,050
The guy next door, the guy
on TV, the guy up the street,

1248
01:11:19,051 --> 01:11:21,370
the guy in the music video,
whoever. I don't know. Whoever,

1249
01:11:21,371 --> 01:11:23,370
whoever's doing better than me.
That's it.

1250
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:28,290
So if you're the parent and you're
losing your temper all the time,

1251
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:30,960
kids going to lose their temper.
Yeah.

1252
01:11:30,961 --> 01:11:35,130
That's how what they're going to
learn that act so point there is

1253
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:41,460
if you lose your temper or if
your kids are losing your temper,

1254
01:11:41,461 --> 01:11:44,250
you start with yourself
because you know the game

1255
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,160
you're looking at and
there's certain things.

1256
01:11:48,161 --> 01:11:52,280
It's real easy to see when someone else
does it. Yeah. Most things. But yeah,

1257
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:54,450
it's really, yeah. You simply don't see,

1258
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:56,620
it sounds like this guy here
that asks this question,

1259
01:11:56,621 --> 01:12:01,150
he's saying his wife loses his temper and
that could be where the kid is getting

1260
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:05,320
the, the modeling from. Right?
Right. And he's saying he doesn't.

1261
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,750
Now is there a chance that he
does to probably, I guess so.

1262
01:12:07,751 --> 01:12:09,790
But it sounds like he's pretty
together and he's saying, look,

1263
01:12:09,791 --> 01:12:13,180
I just need to get them to
calm down. Right. So yeah,

1264
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:17,470
in this situation I'd say it's probably
the wife who is losing her temper and

1265
01:12:17,471 --> 01:12:21,340
then the kid is imitating or modeling
and then we have this scenario happening.

1266
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:24,880
So what we need to do is explain to
everyone in the family that it's not good.

1267
01:12:24,881 --> 01:12:28,450
We're not losing our tempers anymore.
The, yeah. And the reason I say it too is,

1268
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,610
again,
I'm not saying he does lose his temper,

1269
01:12:30,611 --> 01:12:35,530
but I am saying that it is a possibility
that because if let's say mean you are

1270
01:12:35,531 --> 01:12:39,700
husband and wife and
I thought we're just broken

1271
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:47,380
kid, me and my wife. Okay.
If she loses the temper,

1272
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:53,250
her temper and I'm taking
the direct approach,

1273
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:57,370
right? Yeah. Which I understand
your lounge evermore. No,

1274
01:12:57,371 --> 01:12:59,270
I'm going to lose my temper back.
I'm going to go fire.

1275
01:12:59,290 --> 01:13:02,110
I'm going to fight fire with
fire. You raise your voice.
I'm gonna raise my voice.

1276
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:04,120
The kids over there in the corner.
How do I act dope?

1277
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:05,260
That's how I act right there.

1278
01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:08,200
That's a possibility and
kids will become antisocial.

1279
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:11,650
That's the thing goes on.
It's one of the things,

1280
01:13:11,651 --> 01:13:14,200
one of the many things anti social,

1281
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:18,040
I told you about that book called
Mind Games. Small little book.

1282
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:23,160
Forget the author like pretty clearly
and concisely laid out if you have anger

1283
01:13:24,101 --> 01:13:28,330
issues like what? Up with that to
insecurities changed my whole life.

1284
01:13:28,331 --> 01:13:33,260
Low self esteem. Next question. Next.

1285
01:13:33,550 --> 01:13:36,130
Unless you want to go on.
No, you sure? Next question.

1286
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:39,071
Jocko.

1287
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:44,071
Willink tech tactics to flank slash shift
a ferocious analyzer from paralysis to

1288
01:13:47,051 --> 01:13:49,450
go.
Meaning what?

1289
01:13:49,451 --> 01:13:52,060
Somebody who overthinks things hesitated.

1290
01:13:52,061 --> 01:13:53,740
The landing and planning
and planning and planning.

1291
01:13:53,741 --> 01:13:55,060
While there's a couple of things here.

1292
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,750
If the person is above you or
below you in the chain of command,

1293
01:13:58,751 --> 01:14:00,810
so if they're below you in the
chain of command, you, you know,

1294
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:03,460
you explained to them, you say,
look, we don't need perfection.

1295
01:14:03,461 --> 01:14:05,020
We're not going to have a
hundred percent solution.

1296
01:14:05,021 --> 01:14:08,620
We don't have 100% of the information.
That's a good enough solution.

1297
01:14:08,621 --> 01:14:12,010
We need to move forward. Let's execute.
Um, and you know what? I'll take her

1298
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:14,440
just things go wrong. Don't worry about
it. I'll take responsibility for it.

1299
01:14:14,441 --> 01:14:15,220
I'm not going to blame you,

1300
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:17,050
which is what you're gonna
do anyways as a good leader.

1301
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:19,510
So that's what you're gonna do for
their below you in the chain of command.

1302
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:24,190
If they're above you in the
chain of command, guess what?

1303
01:14:24,910 --> 01:14:28,150
Same thing you're going to tell him.
Say the same thing. Like, Hey boss,

1304
01:14:28,151 --> 01:14:30,250
we don't need perfection
here. Look, Boston,

1305
01:14:30,251 --> 01:14:31,900
we're not going to get all
the information we need.

1306
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,520
We're not going to get 100% solution.

1307
01:14:33,521 --> 01:14:37,300
We've got a 90% solution
and let's go for it.

1308
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:42,940
And if things do go wrong, you can
blame me. I don't care. So boom,

1309
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:45,730
the whether they're above you or
below you, the chain of command,

1310
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:48,430
you might change your tact or your
verbiage a little bit, but it's the same,

1311
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:50,080
same overall concept.

1312
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:52,510
You got to get them to understand
that we don't need perfection,

1313
01:14:52,511 --> 01:14:53,470
we need to move forward.

1314
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:56,710
And the other thing is you
explain the cost of not moving,

1315
01:14:57,130 --> 01:14:58,990
the cost of staying still,

1316
01:14:58,991 --> 01:15:03,580
the cost of being reactive instead of
proactive in basically the cost of not

1317
01:15:03,581 --> 01:15:06,400
being aggressive. Cause that's what we're
talking about is a lack of aggression.

1318
01:15:06,610 --> 01:15:07,960
And so what does that look like?

1319
01:15:07,961 --> 01:15:10,330
What you explained to them
that the longer we sit,

1320
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:13,420
the better position the enemy gets into.

1321
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:16,990
The longer we wait,

1322
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:21,520
the less we know about
what is actually happening.

1323
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:25,360
Think about that one.
The more you sit here and you're planning,

1324
01:15:25,361 --> 01:15:27,730
the less we know what's going on
out there. The things are happening,

1325
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:31,030
they're changing, they're
evolving, the enemy's maneuvering.

1326
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:34,510
There's developments on the battlefield
or in the marketplace and you don't even

1327
01:15:34,511 --> 01:15:38,650
know cause you're sitting in the
planning space. The longer we wait,

1328
01:15:38,651 --> 01:15:42,160
the less time we have to recover
if something does go wrong.

1329
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:48,240
So if we sit here and plan for 47 days
and on the 40th day we sat down and we

1330
01:15:49,721 --> 01:15:51,190
start to execute,
something goes wrong.

1331
01:15:51,191 --> 01:15:54,010
Well we're not going to make the 50
day mark cause we spent all that time

1332
01:15:54,011 --> 01:15:57,250
planning.
So the longer that you're sitting around,

1333
01:15:57,251 --> 01:15:59,470
the last time you have to
recover and adapt and adjust.

1334
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,830
And the longer that you wait
while you're doing planning,

1335
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:05,350
the less relevant your
plan actually becomes.

1336
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:10,030
So that's what you need
to make people understand.

1337
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:13,870
And then there's people that
are just habitual and chronic,

1338
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:18,190
ferocious analyzers and those
are the people you got to watch.

1339
01:16:18,191 --> 01:16:22,240
But you got to continually just get
through their head that the more we sit,

1340
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:26,260
the more the enemy maneuvers.
And if we let them maneuver on us anymore,

1341
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:31,120
we're going to get killed. That's
it. Pretty easy. Well, it's not easy.

1342
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:32,290
It's a simple concept.

1343
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:35,680
It's hard to get people out of their own
heads just like this is like everything

1344
01:16:35,681 --> 01:16:36,514
else.

1345
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:42,000
It's hard for the ferocious analyzer to
recognize themselves as that they think

1346
01:16:42,611 --> 01:16:44,690
they're doing a good job.
They think they're,

1347
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:47,350
they think they're actually being
thorough. And you're a wild man.

1348
01:16:47,351 --> 01:16:50,560
You're a cowboy. Are you
crazy? No, I'm not crazy.

1349
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:54,160
I remember one time when my first
deployment to Iraq, they said, Hey John,

1350
01:16:54,161 --> 01:16:56,410
this is after I'd been there for a
while. And they wanted, for some reason,

1351
01:16:56,411 --> 01:17:01,411
they wanted to know the
minimum requirements for us
to go out on an operation.

1352
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:02,320
And I said,

1353
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:06,940
I just need a vicinity of the target
and of radio frequency to talk to the

1354
01:17:06,941 --> 01:17:10,160
local, uh, conventional units
there. And they were like, well,

1355
01:17:10,161 --> 01:17:11,720
don't you need air support? Don't
you do this? And I was, I was like,

1356
01:17:11,721 --> 01:17:16,670
all these other things. I was like, no,
we'll figure it out. Just send us. Yeah,

1357
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:20,930
we'll go. And there was other things
that we would do as we move to a target.

1358
01:17:20,931 --> 01:17:23,510
We align things up and
weed, but we, we'd be good.

1359
01:17:24,050 --> 01:17:28,250
But sometimes people wanted to plan out
every last detail and that doesn't work.

1360
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:29,960
The details are not
going to stay the same.

1361
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:32,450
The things that you're planning
on are going to change.

1362
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:36,110
So don't sit there and plan every last
detail cause not going to help you. Man,

1363
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:38,100
that's actually a pretty good point.

1364
01:17:38,101 --> 01:17:41,660
I never even thought about how you say
if you spend too much time planning,

1365
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:44,540
you know, and then you jump in the
game, I'll late. It's like Dang,

1366
01:17:44,541 --> 01:17:48,970
you have no time to make any adjustment.
Can react better, go perfect. Cause he's,

1367
01:17:48,971 --> 01:17:50,900
that's all he gets a one shot
you got at it and guess what?

1368
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:53,210
It's not going to go perfect
because things don't go perfect. Eh,

1369
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:55,760
things are not going to go perfect.
Not going to happen.

1370
01:17:55,940 --> 01:17:57,440
Those sorts of things
is flawless execution.

1371
01:17:57,441 --> 01:18:00,200
Dave Burke just wrote an article
that was on business insider.

1372
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:04,310
That's what it was like.
Flawless execution doesn't
happen. Uh, the, you know,

1373
01:18:04,311 --> 01:18:08,450
he was a top gun senior instructor
for three years. He, he,

1374
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:13,460
he knows about flying and he knows how
hard they worked to towards flawless

1375
01:18:15,021 --> 01:18:17,750
execution, but it didn't exist.
The flawless execution was,

1376
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:21,920
was analyzing their mistakes,
seeing what they can improve upon.

1377
01:18:21,921 --> 01:18:23,630
That was flawless execution for them.

1378
01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:27,320
It wasn't the actual act of
flawless execution. They, you know,

1379
01:18:27,321 --> 01:18:28,790
what they had for all this debriefing,

1380
01:18:29,690 --> 01:18:32,760
flawless analization of
what they did wrong. Yeah.

1381
01:18:33,170 --> 01:18:35,990
But it wasn't gonna be perfect ops and it
knows no such thing. It doesn't happen.

1382
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,320
So if you're sitting in planning
that trying to make that happen,

1383
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:43,350
it's not gonna work for you.
It's don't do it. Just jump.

1384
01:18:44,170 --> 01:18:48,760
Go.
Next question Jocko.

1385
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:52,220
Got a question. He actually
wrote that. He did. Yeah.

1386
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:56,130
He's fully gain kind of question.

1387
01:18:57,270 --> 01:19:01,100
How would you do with a team member who
tries to take all the responsibility but

1388
01:19:01,101 --> 01:19:03,680
cannot do as good a job as others?

1389
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:09,340
I don't know if it's sincere helpfulness
or desire of power and these are for

1390
01:19:10,581 --> 01:19:12,140
power.
Who see,

1391
01:19:12,141 --> 01:19:15,650
there's a little twist on that one level
twists that puts a lot on that question

1392
01:19:15,651 --> 01:19:17,340
right there.
And so you've got a guy that's,

1393
01:19:17,410 --> 01:19:20,630
I'm trying to take all this responsibility
for everything and not really as good

1394
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:23,450
as he should be to be in that position,
but trying to take responsibility.

1395
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:25,730
And yet the person
that's got the question,

1396
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:29,120
he doesn't know if it's sincere,

1397
01:19:29,121 --> 01:19:32,300
trying to just help out the
team or a desire for power.

1398
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:37,280
So is it helpfulness or is
it their quest for power?

1399
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:42,230
Where they coming from? How do we
figure that out? Well, for one thing,

1400
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:45,200
if someone is truly
trying to help the team,

1401
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:51,010
they will have an open mind to support
and suggestion and help from other

1402
01:19:51,381 --> 01:19:51,890
people.

1403
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:55,250
They'll be open to that because they're
just trying to do the best for the team.

1404
01:19:56,570 --> 01:19:59,900
If they're trying to
take or maintain power,

1405
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,910
which as we know is driven by ego,

1406
01:20:02,911 --> 01:20:07,160
very don't want help and they don't
want suggestions from people either.

1407
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:11,250
They're just gonna do it my
way. I got this. No, it's mine.

1408
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:13,980
So that's the difference.

1409
01:20:14,130 --> 01:20:16,860
So there's going to be two different
ways I'm going to handle this situation.

1410
01:20:16,861 --> 01:20:19,890
So for a person that's actually trying
to help and trying to do a good job,

1411
01:20:19,891 --> 01:20:23,870
I'm going to bolster him up. I love it.
The fact that they have some shortfalls,

1412
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,860
that's okay. You want me to do,
I'm going to give him some support.

1413
01:20:25,861 --> 01:20:29,820
I'm going to put some people on their
team that can help cover some of those

1414
01:20:29,821 --> 01:20:30,654
shortfalls.

1415
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:37,140
I'm going to try and set them up to win
and learn and be educated while they are

1416
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:42,830
winning
and if they're humble,

1417
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,120
which I'm assuming that they are because
they have this attitude that they're

1418
01:20:47,121 --> 01:20:51,050
trying to help out everyone.
Then while I'm doing this whole process,

1419
01:20:51,051 --> 01:20:54,710
of course I'm coaching them
and I'm mentoring them and
giving them suggestions,

1420
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:58,820
am turning to someone that can
do a good job in that situation.

1421
01:20:58,821 --> 01:21:00,230
So that's pretty easy.

1422
01:21:00,231 --> 01:21:02,600
You got someone that wants to take
ownership and responsibility and they're

1423
01:21:02,601 --> 01:21:05,570
doing it for the right reasons. Boom,
let's help them out. What support them.

1424
01:21:05,571 --> 01:21:07,760
Let's get them training. Let's get them
knowledge and let's get them up to speed.

1425
01:21:07,761 --> 01:21:09,740
We got an upcoming leader.
I dig it.

1426
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:16,590
If it's an ego driven person and
they are maneuvering for the power,

1427
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:18,550
okay,

1428
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:21,400
well then what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to let them get humbled by the

1429
01:21:21,401 --> 01:21:24,460
experience because remember it stated
that they're not as good as they could be

1430
01:21:24,461 --> 01:21:25,031
at this job.

1431
01:21:25,031 --> 01:21:27,850
They're not particularly good at what
they're trying to take control over,

1432
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:29,920
so that's fine.
I'm going to let them get humbled by it.

1433
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,560
Now I'm going to assess the risks.

1434
01:21:32,561 --> 01:21:35,830
I'm going to make sure that no one's
going to get hurt or no one's going to get

1435
01:21:35,831 --> 01:21:36,131
killed,

1436
01:21:36,131 --> 01:21:40,030
or we're not going to fail a mission or
in the business world makes sure they're

1437
01:21:40,031 --> 01:21:42,730
not going to lose millions of dollars
and we're not going to suffer coming to

1438
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:44,740
some kind of a strategic setback,

1439
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:49,540
but I am going to let them fail a little
bit and let them see that they're not

1440
01:21:49,541 --> 01:21:54,250
as good as they think they are. I'm
going to let them learn about humility,

1441
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:59,650
right? I'm going to let them learn
about humility. Now, if they learn,

1442
01:22:00,730 --> 01:22:03,610
if they are humbled by that and they
realize that they're not as good as they

1443
01:22:03,611 --> 01:22:06,460
realize that they're not ready to control
everything and they realize that they

1444
01:22:06,461 --> 01:22:11,020
need help. If they learn from it
and they don't just cast blame,

1445
01:22:11,021 --> 01:22:12,250
then they'll become a much better leader.

1446
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,400
You will actually help them
by letting them get humbled.

1447
01:22:15,970 --> 01:22:20,200
If they just get done
and they just cast blame,

1448
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:26,430
then we see them fail and now we
have legitimate reason to say,

1449
01:22:27,281 --> 01:22:29,050
look, I can't put you in
charge. You just failed.

1450
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:30,550
I can't allow this to happen again.

1451
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:36,790
So that's how I would basically
handle that situation.

1452
01:22:36,791 --> 01:22:39,460
Now of course there's all
different kinds of gradations of,

1453
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:44,800
of those realities and the answer will
be somewhat scaled as well. Right?

1454
01:22:45,490 --> 01:22:47,270
So you're, that's what you're,
do you scale the answer?

1455
01:22:47,271 --> 01:22:48,670
Maybe you give this person
a little bit of help,

1456
01:22:48,671 --> 01:22:51,880
but you're gonna to let them
stumble a little bit. You know,

1457
01:22:51,881 --> 01:22:53,770
maybe you're not going to
give me any help at all.

1458
01:22:53,771 --> 01:22:55,270
You're going to fall flat on their face.

1459
01:22:55,420 --> 01:22:57,460
Maybe you're going to
bolster him up a lot,

1460
01:22:57,461 --> 01:22:59,200
but you're still going to talk
to them and say, hey listen,

1461
01:22:59,201 --> 01:23:03,250
you need to step back and get more in the
weeds on some of the lower level stuff

1462
01:23:03,251 --> 01:23:06,010
cause you're not ready to manage
this yet. You know? So it's

1463
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:06,251
cool.

1464
01:23:06,251 --> 01:23:11,251
But that's my basic overall concept
of where I would be going with that.

1465
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:13,600
Do you find that

1466
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:17,200
like even with the expression,

1467
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:22,201
extreme ownership or in this
case all of the responsibility,

1468
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:23,770
do you find that

1469
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:30,520
people get confused but you know, yeah,
like people who will kind of get confused,

1470
01:23:30,521 --> 01:23:33,960
you know how you say, okay
take responsibility. Cause
it seems like anyway,

1471
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,220
from what I told think,
I totally understand what
extreme ownership is. Eric,

1472
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:42,750
I told understand, oh I liked it.
I like we were coming from on high.

1473
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:48,450
You take responsibility for
the mistakes and the solution.

1474
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:54,880
Yes. Right. That is a dream. Ownership.
So, and then, but then from what I heard,

1475
01:23:54,881 --> 01:23:56,980
like sometimes when people
ask questions it'll kind of,

1476
01:23:57,010 --> 01:23:59,950
this one's kind of ambiguous,
but sometimes people will ask it,

1477
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:02,950
ask a question or make a statement,
comment,

1478
01:24:02,951 --> 01:24:07,951
whatever in terms of take
responsibility or take ownership of like

1479
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:13,830
not have the problems or the solutions.
But, but like before the mission,

1480
01:24:13,890 --> 01:24:18,400
like this is my, this is,
you can overstep, you can be,

1481
01:24:18,401 --> 01:24:22,450
you can use too much extreme ownership.
You can say, Hey, this is echo,

1482
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:26,560
this is my mission. I'll you how to do it.
Push it from, you know, input from you.

1483
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:30,520
That's all me. Yeah. And by the way, I'm
taking all the credit to when we get back,

1484
01:24:30,521 --> 01:24:34,000
which is actually equally wrong,
right? I should do is say, hey,

1485
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:37,570
I will echo, I'm in charge
of this, but hey man,

1486
01:24:37,571 --> 01:24:40,000
I want you to come up with a good plan.
I think you've got a great insight.

1487
01:24:40,001 --> 01:24:41,320
I think you know the
terrain better than me.

1488
01:24:41,321 --> 01:24:43,960
Can you come up with a good plan
and then we'll get backwards.

1489
01:24:44,170 --> 01:24:46,660
If it's a successful mission, I'm like,
hey guys, everyone, look what acra did.

1490
01:24:46,661 --> 01:24:49,870
And I, I tell the commanding officer
echo ran this great operation.

1491
01:24:50,110 --> 01:24:53,020
I think he's ready to step up in
leadership. He really did a super job.

1492
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:57,460
If it fails, what am I doing? The
pointing the finger. Adecco. No,

1493
01:24:57,490 --> 01:24:59,890
I'm coming back and said, hey
boss, here's the mission. Failure.

1494
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,080
These are the mistakes I made.
Here's what I did wrong.

1495
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:05,920
Here's what I'm gonna fix next time.
That's real simple. So would you say,

1496
01:25:06,370 --> 01:25:07,203
in a nutshell,

1497
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:12,510
extreme ownership applies to problems
and the solutions to those problems and

1498
01:25:12,911 --> 01:25:16,780
that's all? No, it applies to
everything. It applies to everything.

1499
01:25:16,781 --> 01:25:20,170
Because even when I say, Hey, echo, I
want you to come up with a plan for this.

1500
01:25:20,650 --> 01:25:24,610
You come back and brief me with a plan.
I still take ownership of the plan.

1501
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:28,030
It's your plan. But I go through it and
say, okay, this looks like a good move.

1502
01:25:28,031 --> 01:25:29,890
Hey Echo,
I'm looking at this right here.

1503
01:25:29,891 --> 01:25:33,130
I don't know if this is the best way
to execute this. Here's the issue.

1504
01:25:33,310 --> 01:25:37,240
So I'm not taking ownership of it,
that I'm pulling it away from you,

1505
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:39,640
but I'm definitely going
to make sure we win. I,

1506
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:44,170
that's the thing that drives me crazy
sometimes with leaders is they don't

1507
01:25:44,171 --> 01:25:48,220
realize it, but they're making excuses
because they'll say, oh, you know, I let,

1508
01:25:48,221 --> 01:25:52,270
I let me decentralized command. So
I, I can't control everything. No,

1509
01:25:52,330 --> 01:25:53,920
actually you are
responsible for everything.

1510
01:25:53,921 --> 01:25:57,160
And if I got three teams out there and
you're one of the team leaders and I come

1511
01:25:57,161 --> 01:25:59,140
to you and say, Hey, echo, here's
the plan. I want you to execute.

1512
01:25:59,890 --> 01:26:01,540
I still have to look at the plan.

1513
01:26:01,541 --> 01:26:03,650
I still have to make sure that
I agree with what you're doing.

1514
01:26:03,651 --> 01:26:06,180
I have to make sure you're not doing
something that doesn't make sense. Right.

1515
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:09,560
So I, yes, I do have ownership
of the plan. Yeah, absolutely.

1516
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:14,330
Like it's your family member or
something. Yeah. That plan is like,

1517
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:18,190
I love it. Like a sun kind of the plan
is the plan. You came up with a plan,

1518
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:22,640
you created it. It's my grandkid. Yeah.
Yeah. Right. So you're, it's yours.

1519
01:26:22,641 --> 01:26:26,270
But I'm still going to take responsibility
and ownership. But where people,

1520
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,060
it's when your ego starts flaring
up and I started saying, no,

1521
01:26:29,061 --> 01:26:32,550
this is my plan and we're gonna do it my
way. That's where we have issues. Yeah.

1522
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:33,650
But yeah,

1523
01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:37,700
the ownership doesn't stop and it just
doesn't stop when you're in a leadership

1524
01:26:37,701 --> 01:26:40,400
position. It doesn't stop on everything
up and down the chain of command.

1525
01:26:40,610 --> 01:26:43,940
It's hard to do. It's hard
on your ego for sure. Yeah.

1526
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:47,480
Cause it kind of seems in a way countering
too, I guess if you understand though,

1527
01:26:47,530 --> 01:26:49,730
they'll all the little
subtle dynamics of it.

1528
01:26:49,730 --> 01:26:51,980
Cause you know how like if the plan fails,
boom,

1529
01:26:51,981 --> 01:26:54,080
that's when the extreme ownership
is really going to show its head.

1530
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:58,460
If it's a super successful,
flawless plan, it does it.

1531
01:26:58,461 --> 01:27:02,210
It's more covert because
it's more internal because
you got to give the credit

1532
01:27:02,211 --> 01:27:04,910
for sure. Everyone else, everyone
will will sit there and go,

1533
01:27:04,911 --> 01:27:08,780
oh Jockos you know he's, he's giving
the credit to echo for the operation.

1534
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:11,780
We won't show up as
extreme ownership for sure.

1535
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:16,640
It'll be harder to see
and people will say, Dang,

1536
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:19,010
people know that I was
in charge right then.

1537
01:27:19,011 --> 01:27:22,110
Don't want me over all the guys so I'm
still going to get some credit. Right. It,

1538
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:26,660
it's more covert, but it's way more covert
and it's matter. It's better. That's,

1539
01:27:26,661 --> 01:27:29,390
that's the hard thing. That's what's
so hard for people to realize.

1540
01:27:29,391 --> 01:27:33,170
They want so bad to raise their hand
and say, yes, it was me. It was my,

1541
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:36,830
it was my operation. But it doesn't
help you. It doesn't help you.

1542
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:40,970
It feels good for like a half a second
and then you realize you just deflated

1543
01:27:40,971 --> 01:27:41,804
yourself.

1544
01:27:42,170 --> 01:27:46,010
Is that kind of like when you make a
donation to charity but you want like

1545
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,590
everyone to know that you did
it. It's kind of like that. Yeah,

1546
01:27:48,591 --> 01:27:50,840
I guess it's similar to
that similar concept, right?

1547
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:55,850
Like in a weird kind of profound way.
That's the question.

1548
01:27:55,940 --> 01:27:57,530
I guess we'll just move
on to next question.

1549
01:27:57,531 --> 01:28:02,531
How just the profoundness of your last
day to think on a certain level it's the

1550
01:28:02,811 --> 01:28:06,530
same thing because you know you
did something good, you know,

1551
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:11,050
or you are something good or whatever.
But it's like saying I'm,

1552
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:15,360
I'm the most humble guy in the world.
You know, I'm just here, down to here.

1553
01:28:15,361 --> 01:28:19,400
And here's the other thing about this.
When I give you the credit for success,

1554
01:28:20,330 --> 01:28:25,250
not only do I Wayne covertly in
that you look at me and go, man,

1555
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:27,680
he gave me a couple
corrections that were critical.

1556
01:28:27,681 --> 01:28:29,420
There's operation and he's
not even saying anything.

1557
01:28:29,421 --> 01:28:31,220
So you have even more respect from me,

1558
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:34,730
which means you're going to work harder
for me in the future and you're going to

1559
01:28:34,731 --> 01:28:36,650
do even more and we're
going to look even better.

1560
01:28:36,651 --> 01:28:39,150
So I am going to ultimately win.
Yeah.

1561
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:43,970
Because my team is going to be kicking
so much ass all over the globe and people

1562
01:28:43,971 --> 01:28:46,880
are saying, wow, you know this, these
guys were just winning everywhere.

1563
01:28:46,881 --> 01:28:49,970
They go and, and, and so
it's very, very positive.

1564
01:28:49,971 --> 01:28:54,971
Whereas if I took that credit from you
on that first operation and I took it

1565
01:28:55,011 --> 01:28:59,960
from you, how are you working on that
next one? Not as hard, not as hard.

1566
01:29:00,050 --> 01:29:04,950
You know, maybe guy, maybe you're a
great guy, but you're just a great guy,

1567
01:29:04,951 --> 01:29:07,350
but you're still not going
to go that extra little edge.

1568
01:29:07,351 --> 01:29:09,660
You're not going to do it cause you're
not going to get credit and you're not

1569
01:29:09,661 --> 01:29:13,020
going to do because you don't care that
much about making me look good as you

1570
01:29:13,021 --> 01:29:14,310
would if I was taking care of you.

1571
01:29:14,910 --> 01:29:18,270
There's nothing better than having
guys that you're taken care of.

1572
01:29:18,330 --> 01:29:21,750
They know you're taking care of them and
they're going to do anything for you.

1573
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:24,210
Like they're going to do
anything you, you, you know,

1574
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:29,070
and you'll do anything for
them. It's a mutual thing.
It's real. It's a real thing.

1575
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:30,393
Yeah.

1576
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:35,780
It's like the gift that keeps on getting
rid of it is, is a powerful tool.

1577
01:29:35,950 --> 01:29:38,640
You know, that's what the book's been
so popular and it's, and, and it's,

1578
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:43,230
it's why the book has been
so popular because when you,

1579
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:46,380
when you break it down and
people see what it does,

1580
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:50,230
they realize how powerful it is.
And it's, and it's also, you know,

1581
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:54,960
another reason that the book is so popular
is because we put it in a very clear

1582
01:29:55,050 --> 01:29:59,610
way and it's easier to understand.
It doesn't make it easier to execute,

1583
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:04,650
but it makes it easier to understand
for sure. Yeah. It's crazy to,

1584
01:30:04,651 --> 01:30:08,670
oh and someone said, I forget it might
have been someone at the muster, I dunno.

1585
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:11,200
Could, could have very little bit
on Twitter. I don't know. But oh,

1586
01:30:11,790 --> 01:30:16,230
someone was saying how it's so interesting
how they started to realize that it

1587
01:30:16,231 --> 01:30:20,430
applies to their relationship with their
husband or wife. Oh for sure. Like that.

1588
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:26,220
And I always kind of look at all this
stuff is primarily that, you know,

1589
01:30:26,221 --> 01:30:29,970
cause I mean who do it, especially
now, who do I work with you? Oh,

1590
01:30:30,290 --> 01:30:34,230
I don't have to, like, I don't go through
these extreme ownership struggles,

1591
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:36,480
Pluto with you. So it's more, you know,

1592
01:30:36,481 --> 01:30:39,720
so to me everything up just applies to
like your relationship with your life,

1593
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:44,380
whatever, you know. So and it all
translates all of it. It does. Yeah.

1594
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:48,840
And when you take ownership of stuff,
it's when you take ownership of stuff,

1595
01:30:48,841 --> 01:30:52,200
then you can control the outcome. Yeah.
It's crazy. When you don't own it,

1596
01:30:52,201 --> 01:30:56,450
you don't get anywhere. Yeah.
And that, that um, you know,

1597
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:59,180
you have a, I dunno,
disagreement, argument, any,

1598
01:30:59,181 --> 01:31:03,930
any ripples in the water where the
instinct is to point fingers, you know.

1599
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:04,831
But when you,

1600
01:31:04,831 --> 01:31:07,680
even though one other person is really
in the grand scheme of things here,

1601
01:31:07,681 --> 01:31:08,491
both to blame,
I know that,

1602
01:31:08,491 --> 01:31:13,491
but they do have their huge role in the
issue and the problem don't do that.

1603
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:16,440
Don't even pay attention to that.

1604
01:31:16,441 --> 01:31:20,580
All you've got to do is shine the light
on your own things and say, don't, I mean,

1605
01:31:20,730 --> 01:31:24,660
and how you say, don't be, don't
be hard on yourself. You know,

1606
01:31:24,661 --> 01:31:28,070
like that kind of like the kind, I
suck, I suck. It's not that it's no,

1607
01:31:28,090 --> 01:31:32,880
it's like this is what I can do.
Exactly. Right. So what's interesting is,

1608
01:31:32,881 --> 01:31:33,870
and you said it from the beginning,

1609
01:31:33,871 --> 01:31:38,490
but it is interesting to just watch
it play out. So far it's almost fun,

1610
01:31:38,491 --> 01:31:41,940
but it's more just real interesting where
when you do it and you just keep doing

1611
01:31:41,941 --> 01:31:43,920
it, you always do it. That's
thing consistently do it.

1612
01:31:43,921 --> 01:31:47,130
You just watch how the other person just
changes and just becomes kind of the

1613
01:31:47,131 --> 01:31:48,960
same thing.
And before you know it,

1614
01:31:48,961 --> 01:31:52,620
like the ripples in the water are pretty
much gone. Yeah. And what's you need,

1615
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:56,550
someone in the team has
got to start doing it.

1616
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:00,040
That's one of the hardest things.
Yeah. Occasionally we'll work with

1617
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:04,330
a company where everyone's like,
oh yeah, extreme ownership.

1618
01:32:04,450 --> 01:32:09,100
No one is actually doing it when
no one is actually doing it.

1619
01:32:09,101 --> 01:32:10,690
And all they're saying is like,
I wish that guy,

1620
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:12,850
he had extreme ownership and that guy
should have extreme ownership and I don't

1621
01:32:12,851 --> 01:32:15,220
see anyone else taking
that ownership and hey,

1622
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:19,450
I haven't seen anyone else taking
ownership and therefore how can I take

1623
01:32:19,451 --> 01:32:21,340
ownership?
You know,

1624
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:25,180
we send out when we work with a company
will send out surveys, you know,

1625
01:32:25,370 --> 01:32:30,070
pre class surveys and in post, because
we'll, we'll do a number of sessions.

1626
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:34,870
So we'll send out to the leadership team
that we're working with, how's it going?

1627
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:38,110
And we'll, we'll send out a week later,
two weeks later, three weeks later,

1628
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:38,973
four weeks later.

1629
01:32:39,190 --> 01:32:43,240
And sometimes when you get a team
where no one is taking ownership and,

1630
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:47,710
and literally you'll hear people say,
well, the boss isn't taking ownership.

1631
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:51,370
So how can I take ownership if the
boss hasn't even taken ownership?

1632
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:56,050
They don't realize that when
your boss isn't taking ownership,

1633
01:32:56,080 --> 01:33:01,080
it is an opportunity for you to take
ownership and to excel and to gain respect

1634
01:33:04,270 --> 01:33:08,170
than trust and power and power,

1635
01:33:08,171 --> 01:33:10,900
which is a good thing because you're
doing things for the good of the team.

1636
01:33:10,930 --> 01:33:14,140
So you want to have power, right?
I want to have power when I'm,

1637
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:17,590
when I'm a team leader,
I absolutely want to have power.

1638
01:33:17,890 --> 01:33:20,740
And the reason I want to have power so
I can distribute it properly amongst my

1639
01:33:20,741 --> 01:33:24,610
team and I can utilize it.
So we can be successful in our mission.

1640
01:33:25,270 --> 01:33:28,990
So when you have your CEO
isn't taking ownership,

1641
01:33:29,950 --> 01:33:32,680
awesome, I'm going to take
ownership. And when the rest,

1642
01:33:32,681 --> 01:33:36,130
if the CEO is truly not
taking ownership and I do,

1643
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:40,600
everyone else looks at me and they
start to, I elevate my position,

1644
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:43,900
that CEO becomes irrelevant because all
he's doing is sitting around pointing

1645
01:33:43,901 --> 01:33:45,880
fingers. I'm taking ownership
of things and solving them.

1646
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:49,150
I'm actually going to end up
in a superior position. Now,

1647
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:54,450
I might not get promoted the CEO
today or tomorrow or in two years.

1648
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:00,000
But when this information gets back to
the board or to the directors or whoever,

1649
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:04,360
they realize that there's one person
that's mutually respected by everybody.

1650
01:34:04,361 --> 01:34:08,200
And that's Hugh. Because you took
ownership and when you take ownership,

1651
01:34:08,201 --> 01:34:11,530
you solve problems and when
you solve problems you win.

1652
01:34:12,430 --> 01:34:14,090
But somebody has got to start it.

1653
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:18,730
And it's hard sometimes in some
situations you get the, the,

1654
01:34:18,810 --> 01:34:22,360
what's the word they use, like
the caustic environment. Toxic,

1655
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:26,050
the toxic environment
where everyone's just so,

1656
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:29,680
so defensive about everything
and it's difficult.

1657
01:34:29,681 --> 01:34:32,290
Those are the difficult situations to,
to work with Bw.

1658
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:36,640
And all it takes is the
transition of one human,

1659
01:34:36,790 --> 01:34:40,480
one person in that team to
step up and say, you know what?

1660
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:45,760
This stuff that's going wrong is my fault.
Ceos don't worry about him.

1661
01:34:46,090 --> 01:34:49,810
He's got enough problems.
He's got to deal with the,

1662
01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:54,100
he's got a deal with the
shareholders meeting. We don't,

1663
01:34:54,101 --> 01:34:56,440
we need to protect him.
You know what?

1664
01:34:56,441 --> 01:34:59,780
This is my fault that this happened and
here's what we're going to do to fix it.

1665
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:03,890
Here's what I'm going to do.
And that just changes the attitudes.

1666
01:35:04,010 --> 01:35:06,410
And of course you're going to have
two or three people in that defensive,

1667
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:09,110
toxic environment that are looking at him
go, yeah, that's right. It is your fault.

1668
01:35:09,111 --> 01:35:13,460
And you know what you say to that. Yeah,
you're right. It is. It is my fault.

1669
01:35:13,610 --> 01:35:15,620
And here's what we're do. Fix it.
Here's how I'm going to move forward.

1670
01:35:15,650 --> 01:35:16,940
Here's what we're going to do to change.

1671
01:35:18,050 --> 01:35:20,990
But it's hard to be that person to take
that first step and then you got to keep

1672
01:35:20,991 --> 01:35:23,990
that going, you know? But
again, man, after a little bit,

1673
01:35:23,991 --> 01:35:26,750
you see the guy next to you, you started
to do it, then the guy next door,

1674
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:30,650
it's an extreme ownership,
the book it's pointed out,

1675
01:35:30,651 --> 01:35:34,220
but it's not super crystal clear that
when I was taking blame for the blue on

1676
01:35:34,221 --> 01:35:37,550
blue, that happened. Everyone
else was too. You know,
those guys were saying, Hey,

1677
01:35:37,551 --> 01:35:39,530
it was my fault. I did this.
It was my fault. I did this.

1678
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:40,880
And that was cause that was,

1679
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:45,890
that wasn't the first time these guys
had seen or heard ownership. You know,

1680
01:35:45,891 --> 01:35:48,500
when we were going through training and
something was screwed up, I'd be like,

1681
01:35:48,501 --> 01:35:49,690
Hey, this is my fault. Just wanted to end.

1682
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:54,530
So everyone had that really good attitude.
Yeah. So, and that happens in a company.

1683
01:35:54,531 --> 01:35:58,280
So what you're saying it does, that's
one of the best things about this idea,

1684
01:35:58,281 --> 01:36:01,550
this principle of extreme ownership
is it spreads throughout the company.

1685
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:06,580
And will you get people on the team
that will not take ownership of things?

1686
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:08,930
Yes,
of course you will.

1687
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:14,530
You will get that person and eventually
they will either leave or you will fire

1688
01:36:15,381 --> 01:36:17,510
them. One on one of the two things will
happen because when you have a person,

1689
01:36:17,511 --> 01:36:19,520
when you've got the whole team
is going, no, it's my fault.

1690
01:36:19,610 --> 01:36:22,850
And eventually everyone's, Oh you, oh
you, that's not your responsibility. Cool.

1691
01:36:22,851 --> 01:36:26,540
I'll take that. Oh, Echo, you can't handle
that. Cool. That's not your fault. Okay,

1692
01:36:26,541 --> 01:36:28,910
then I'll, I'll take it and fix it.
Oh, Echo, you can't handle that either.

1693
01:36:28,940 --> 01:36:30,740
It's not your fault. Okay, I'll
take that and fix it. Eventually.

1694
01:36:30,741 --> 01:36:32,780
You don't have a job anymore,
so if you want it,

1695
01:36:32,781 --> 01:36:34,970
don't want to take ownership
of things including problems.

1696
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,460
I will take ownership of all of them and
all eventually take your job and your

1697
01:36:37,461 --> 01:36:39,600
world and there'll be mine.
It gets phased, right?

1698
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:41,990
That's phase you write out
like you weren't even there.

1699
01:36:42,890 --> 01:36:47,150
That's what's going to happen.
So yes, it's a powerful,

1700
01:36:47,151 --> 01:36:48,380
powerful tool.

1701
01:36:49,130 --> 01:36:54,130
And then the other thing is you see like
you see politicians do it all the time.

1702
01:36:54,771 --> 01:36:57,710
They don't take ownership when they
make a mistake. And when they do,

1703
01:36:57,711 --> 01:37:01,040
it's sort of this lip service
of a, you know, it was my fault.

1704
01:37:01,041 --> 01:37:04,480
It was my fault that this happened, but
right, right. He bought blah, blah, blah,

1705
01:37:04,481 --> 01:37:08,910
blah, blah, blah and tie and
all anyone hears is blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1706
01:37:08,911 --> 01:37:11,300
Big Ones. As soon as you say, but,
and then you make a bunch of excuses,

1707
01:37:11,301 --> 01:37:14,840
that's all anybody hears. Yeah.
And there's just, it's so weak.

1708
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:19,430
It's so weak to do that. And
it sounds when, like you said,

1709
01:37:19,670 --> 01:37:21,110
when you get used to hearing it,

1710
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:23,840
when you get used to hearing
people take ownership of things,

1711
01:37:23,841 --> 01:37:24,890
when somebody does it,

1712
01:37:24,950 --> 01:37:28,910
it sounds like Satan is
screaming out of their mouth and,

1713
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:32,780
and just horrible. It
sounds awful. It's like a,

1714
01:37:32,870 --> 01:37:35,190
it's like a coffin if

1715
01:37:37,730 --> 01:37:42,170
you just sickness. Right. That's
what it is. It stands up for sure.

1716
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:43,431
When we are at the muster,

1717
01:37:43,431 --> 01:37:48,431
it's like I was talking about how when
you start taking ownership of things,

1718
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:52,820
when you start having this attitude,
when,

1719
01:37:52,940 --> 01:37:57,690
when you feel yourself about to a
mistake and blame on someone else,

1720
01:37:58,070 --> 01:38:00,530
like you feel like you're gonna throw
up in your mouth, it keeps like your,

1721
01:38:00,630 --> 01:38:01,111
it's like you,

1722
01:38:01,111 --> 01:38:04,690
it's like vomit is coming out of your
mouth and then you drove it back down.

1723
01:38:04,710 --> 01:38:08,730
Cause you don't want to let that puke out
onto the floor and let everyone see it.

1724
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:12,450
It's not allowed. That's all it is. When
you blame, everyone else has all it is,

1725
01:38:12,451 --> 01:38:16,820
it happens all the time.
And it's so, it's, it's the,

1726
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:20,420
it's like the other thing
I talk about with, with um,

1727
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:23,580
stepping back and,

1728
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:27,330
and how you step back off the line
and how much visibility you have.

1729
01:38:27,330 --> 01:38:29,340
As soon as you step back
off the firing line,

1730
01:38:29,341 --> 01:38:33,600
as soon as you just elevate yourself
six inches above what's happening,

1731
01:38:33,930 --> 01:38:36,960
it's the same thing when you start to
take ownership. It's like the change.

1732
01:38:36,961 --> 01:38:38,760
It's just this little change,

1733
01:38:39,090 --> 01:38:43,380
but it just completely changes the dynamic
of what is going on in your business

1734
01:38:43,381 --> 01:38:47,010
and in your life, in your life.
Because it's the same thing in life.

1735
01:38:47,011 --> 01:38:48,390
When people are blaming everyone else,

1736
01:38:48,391 --> 01:38:52,110
they're blaming the market and they're
blaming their parents and they're blaming

1737
01:38:52,111 --> 01:38:52,710
the,

1738
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:57,120
the debt that they built up and
they're blaming the car that broke.

1739
01:38:57,121 --> 01:39:00,930
They're blaming everything else
that's going on and when you,

1740
01:39:00,990 --> 01:39:02,850
when all you and everything,
when nothing is your fault,

1741
01:39:03,090 --> 01:39:05,460
what are you going to fix the answers.
You're not going to fix anything.

1742
01:39:05,970 --> 01:39:06,900
Whereas if you go,
okay,

1743
01:39:07,470 --> 01:39:11,340
these are some mistakes that I made and
here's what I'm going to do to fix them,

1744
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:17,250
that's that paradigm change and that's
where you start getting on the right path.

1745
01:39:17,550 --> 01:39:22,060
Oh,
the muster your line at the muster.

1746
01:39:22,061 --> 01:39:26,620
I included it in the video.
Favorite line, I think it says,

1747
01:39:27,010 --> 01:39:30,070
sure,
I'll take the blame and I don't care.

1748
01:39:30,310 --> 01:39:34,360
I have a mission to accomplish and
I got to get the problem solved.

1749
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:37,810
That's what it was. Yeah, it's in the
video. The best part of my opinion.

1750
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:42,460
I will take the blame and I don't care.
I don't care.

1751
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:46,900
Bring it. Bring it Jocko.

1752
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:49,930
We've got time for one more.
Yes.

1753
01:39:51,850 --> 01:39:52,683
I think we do.

1754
01:39:54,110 --> 01:39:59,110
Jocko on the Joe Rogan experience
Everlast from house of Payne was on mls,

1755
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:03,790
was explaining how he wasn't in shape
and Joe played the good video for every

1756
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:08,140
last said it is inspiring
but it didn't always work.

1757
01:40:08,770 --> 01:40:13,330
And the example he gave was a sick
daughter who had lung disease that the

1758
01:40:13,331 --> 01:40:18,160
doctors can't explain. I wondered
the same thing. How's the sick child?

1759
01:40:18,610 --> 01:40:19,443
Good

1760
01:40:21,380 --> 01:40:22,213
yours.

1761
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:28,500
I saw that episode as well and
it's definitely a hard question.

1762
01:40:32,290 --> 01:40:34,910
And actually to quote,

1763
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:36,330
okay,

1764
01:40:36,330 --> 01:40:41,250
a song, a great song by Everlast and I,

1765
01:40:41,310 --> 01:40:46,310
I haven't walked a mile in his shoes
and I've been extremely lucky and and

1766
01:40:51,390 --> 01:40:53,650
blessed with the

1767
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:59,170
health of my family,
my wife and my children.

1768
01:40:59,171 --> 01:41:01,840
And I am so,

1769
01:41:03,730 --> 01:41:05,470
so thankful for that.

1770
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:07,793
But

1771
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:13,690
I have been around disease
and I have been around death

1772
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:17,140
and of course

1773
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:24,320
to say there is something good about
death and disease is impossible to do,

1774
01:41:24,781 --> 01:41:29,460
to to hell with disease,

1775
01:41:31,410 --> 01:41:36,410
to hell with cancer and als and heart
disease and all the rest of them,

1776
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:43,180
to hell with them all

1777
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:47,180
and death

1778
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:52,090
to hell with death.

1779
01:41:52,330 --> 01:41:56,320
I have nothing good to say
about disease or death.

1780
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,840
Curse them both,

1781
01:42:06,050 --> 01:42:09,020
but,
but then what

1782
01:42:12,260 --> 01:42:14,600
is that where I'm supposed to focus?

1783
01:42:17,090 --> 01:42:22,090
Am I to latch on to death and disease
and ride with them down to the depths of

1784
01:42:25,791 --> 01:42:26,624
despair?

1785
01:42:30,910 --> 01:42:31,743
I say,
no,

1786
01:42:35,140 --> 01:42:38,170
no.
I will not ride with them.

1787
01:42:38,171 --> 01:42:42,040
I will not go down there evil path

1788
01:42:47,430 --> 01:42:51,510
instead because I cannot find good

1789
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:56,340
in their vile darkness,

1790
01:42:58,510 --> 01:43:01,470
the vile darkness of disease and of Def,

1791
01:43:03,470 --> 01:43:05,570
I will not feed their fire.

1792
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:10,370
I won't feed their egos.
Instead

1793
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:13,960
coming to look elsewhere,

1794
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:21,800
I will look to life and light and
I will find good in those places

1795
01:43:26,150 --> 01:43:29,750
I find good in every moment I get,

1796
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:33,200
I'll find good in every
breath I'll find good.

1797
01:43:33,410 --> 01:43:38,410
Making memories and holding them dear.

1798
01:43:42,130 --> 01:43:44,860
I'll find good in knowing

1799
01:43:46,930 --> 01:43:50,860
that I will learn from
this horrible experience

1800
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:58,320
that everything that I'm going through,
all the pain and suffering and darkness,

1801
01:44:00,190 --> 01:44:03,310
it'll make the light
brighter

1802
01:44:04,870 --> 01:44:06,820
and stronger and more powerful,

1803
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:14,270
more powerful than disease
and more powerful than death.

1804
01:44:18,240 --> 01:44:19,073
Yeah.

1805
01:44:19,650 --> 01:44:24,300
So
cry

1806
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:29,890
and scream
in,

1807
01:44:29,891 --> 01:44:34,891
shake your fist at the sky and curse
death and curse disease and shout to the

1808
01:44:36,781 --> 01:44:40,820
world that life isn't fair
then.

1809
01:44:40,821 --> 01:44:45,260
That this is not deserved.
Not For me, not from my child,

1810
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:49,520
not from my friend, my
spouse, my brother, my sister,

1811
01:44:49,850 --> 01:44:50,810
not for anyone.

1812
01:44:56,430 --> 01:44:58,950
And then book up

1813
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:04,033
and breathe

1814
01:45:06,530 --> 01:45:09,990
in all that darkness and all that evil.

1815
01:45:12,610 --> 01:45:13,630
Let it all go.

1816
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:20,910
Peyton,
when it creeps back again,

1817
01:45:23,790 --> 01:45:24,900
let it go again.

1818
01:45:29,610 --> 01:45:34,150
Let it go.
Yeah,

1819
01:45:34,210 --> 01:45:35,043
look forward

1820
01:45:38,390 --> 01:45:41,660
toward the light,
toward life,

1821
01:45:44,050 --> 01:45:44,950
toward the future

1822
01:45:49,450 --> 01:45:52,270
and of the past.
Let the memories,

1823
01:45:53,830 --> 01:45:55,600
the sacred memories.

1824
01:45:57,230 --> 01:45:58,063
Yeah.

1825
01:45:58,220 --> 01:46:02,810
Let those flourish and grow

1826
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:08,810
and expunge the darkness from your world

1827
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:19,940
and replace it all
with good.

1828
01:46:26,730 --> 01:46:30,690
And I think that's
all I've got for tonight.

1829
01:46:40,610 --> 01:46:43,930
The rough one. Yeah, I think

1830
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:49,080
probably that. Okay. It's like, I think

1831
01:46:50,850 --> 01:46:54,600
that like, that outlook
on it is, is important.

1832
01:46:54,601 --> 01:46:58,520
Cause that's not just easy to do, you
know, especially men and me probably,

1833
01:46:58,530 --> 01:46:59,750
I've been lucky,

1834
01:47:00,570 --> 01:47:05,010
my daughter had a staph infection in
her lymph nodes in the hospital for like

1835
01:47:05,010 --> 01:47:08,010
week. We can after them like that.
And, and you have the viewpoint,

1836
01:47:08,940 --> 01:47:11,390
you're lucky that that happened.
You know,

1837
01:47:11,490 --> 01:47:14,820
when you go to a children's ward and you
see kids that are just suffering from

1838
01:47:14,821 --> 01:47:19,800
horrible diseases, it's awful. You
feel lucky exactly. As you should,

1839
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:23,850
you know, hey, we're lucky
to have this. Yeah. And at,

1840
01:47:24,150 --> 01:47:27,660
in that moment when we were in
the hospital, I'm like, you know,

1841
01:47:27,661 --> 01:47:32,650
like you're scared. You're like
sad, scared for them. You know,

1842
01:47:32,710 --> 01:47:37,590
it's just,
but I think that just even hearing that,

1843
01:47:37,591 --> 01:47:42,330
it's like, it's Kinda like,
it does help, you know? Yeah.

1844
01:47:42,331 --> 01:47:46,140
And it's one of the things that,
you know, when, uh, when, uh,

1845
01:47:47,510 --> 01:47:51,190
you know, when you talk about the
reaction you have and you know,

1846
01:47:51,210 --> 01:47:56,210
the fact that it's okay to like
scream and shake your fist at the sky,

1847
01:47:58,561 --> 01:48:03,480
that's okay for that. And then I'm saying,
you know that you've got to let it go.

1848
01:48:03,481 --> 01:48:04,890
But at the same time,

1849
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:09,930
everyone's got to realize that like
you let it go, it's coming back,

1850
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:15,560
it's coming back and it'll sneak up on
you again and then you kind of do it

1851
01:48:15,661 --> 01:48:20,400
again. You know, you got to, you got to
go through that. You've got to scream and,

1852
01:48:21,010 --> 01:48:22,020
and

1853
01:48:23,550 --> 01:48:26,130
curse the evil that it is,

1854
01:48:26,430 --> 01:48:29,640
and then you got to let it go again and
you're going to go through that cycle

1855
01:48:29,641 --> 01:48:30,960
over and over again.

1856
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:35,220
But what you can't do is you
can't not go through the cycle.

1857
01:48:35,221 --> 01:48:39,930
You can't just get trapped in the
screaming and the suffering and the pain.

1858
01:48:39,931 --> 01:48:42,690
You can't get trapped there. And it's
really hard. And I noticed that, you know,

1859
01:48:42,691 --> 01:48:46,200
when I had,
when I had my friends get killed overseas,

1860
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:51,900
I realized, you know, when we'd be home
and like everything would be normal.

1861
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:55,530
Like maybe it would be out having some
beers with the boys or we'd be doing

1862
01:48:55,531 --> 01:48:59,490
something and all of a sudden, like you
just get hit with this wave of sadness.

1863
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:00,930
And it would kind of just,

1864
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:06,090
almost instantly I'd be like breaking
down would be that could be like ready to

1865
01:49:06,091 --> 01:49:11,091
cry or crying and then three
minutes later I'm like out of it.

1866
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:13,020
You know?
I just had to get rid of it.

1867
01:49:13,021 --> 01:49:17,580
I just had to expunge that sadness and,

1868
01:49:17,610 --> 01:49:22,610
but what you can't do is you just
can't get caught in those cycles.

1869
01:49:22,921 --> 01:49:24,780
And I think that's what happens to people.
And again,

1870
01:49:24,810 --> 01:49:28,680
I haven't walked a mile in those shoes,

1871
01:49:29,700 --> 01:49:32,880
but what I have seen is
I know that it's hard.

1872
01:49:32,881 --> 01:49:35,310
I know that it's heartbreaking,

1873
01:49:35,670 --> 01:49:38,970
but you can't let it break everything.

1874
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:42,330
You have to try and hold it together.
Yeah.

1875
01:49:42,740 --> 01:49:47,230
It's like part of the like going through,
I know this little low level,

1876
01:49:47,231 --> 01:49:48,010
I guess I understand

1877
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:48,671
it's like a low level,

1878
01:49:48,671 --> 01:49:53,650
but part of like the feeling that you
get is like what do I do? Like I don't,

1879
01:49:53,651 --> 01:49:58,000
I feel like he can't do anything. And then
that provides these feelings, you know?

1880
01:49:58,390 --> 01:50:02,470
But if you start to, to understand
what it is that you do have to do,

1881
01:50:02,471 --> 01:50:06,570
and one of those things is, is
essentially like understand it that yeah,

1882
01:50:06,571 --> 01:50:09,010
it's going on.
Don't try to block it or escape,

1883
01:50:09,790 --> 01:50:11,980
do some escapists activity or whatever.

1884
01:50:12,130 --> 01:50:15,700
Just know and understand that it's
going on. And then on top of that,

1885
01:50:15,910 --> 01:50:20,200
on top of it, your job is
to be strong, you know? Yep.

1886
01:50:20,860 --> 01:50:23,560
You know, that's, that's another
thing that I've noticed especially,

1887
01:50:23,590 --> 01:50:27,760
and it happens with anybody but with
some of my CEO friends that have been in

1888
01:50:27,761 --> 01:50:29,410
these horrible situations,

1889
01:50:29,890 --> 01:50:34,890
is there Alpha guys that are used to
being in control of everything and used to

1890
01:50:37,541 --> 01:50:41,750
being able to control the outcome and
you all of a sudden you can't. Yeah.

1891
01:50:41,860 --> 01:50:46,660
You can't control the outcome.
And then what do you do? Well,

1892
01:50:48,220 --> 01:50:52,150
it's like we learned from Charlie plum.

1893
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:54,190
It's like we learned from bill reader,

1894
01:50:54,220 --> 01:50:57,580
you can't control that thing.

1895
01:50:57,940 --> 01:51:01,030
The only thing you can
control is your own attitude,

1896
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:05,320
your own view of what's happening.
And if you're,

1897
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:09,520
if you control your attitude and you
make your attitude the best possible

1898
01:51:09,521 --> 01:51:11,800
attitude it can be. That's the
best you're going to do. And again,

1899
01:51:12,010 --> 01:51:13,720
I wish there was some,
I don't have some

1900
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:20,350
miracle solution to these situations
and no one does. If we had the miracle,

1901
01:51:20,351 --> 01:51:23,860
these problems wouldn't happen.
These horrible things wouldn't happen.

1902
01:51:24,910 --> 01:51:27,130
So what can we actually control?

1903
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:32,230
Who will keep control is our own
view of it. Our own assessment,

1904
01:51:32,650 --> 01:51:37,630
our own attitude,
and that sounds like a trite word,

1905
01:51:37,631 --> 01:51:42,631
but our own attitude of what's happening
and make that as good as we can.

1906
01:51:43,961 --> 01:51:47,200
And are there going to be points where
your attitude turns completely dark and

1907
01:51:47,201 --> 01:51:49,510
negative? Of course there
are. How can you not?

1908
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:53,620
But don't let it be permanent.

1909
01:51:54,610 --> 01:51:57,610
Don't let it be permanent for
the sake of the situation,

1910
01:51:57,611 --> 01:52:01,930
for the sake of the person you care about.
They don't want you to live like that.

1911
01:52:03,670 --> 01:52:06,260
So don't, and again, there's,

1912
01:52:06,270 --> 01:52:09,700
you know it's going to be sick
Sicko core from what I've seen,

1913
01:52:09,701 --> 01:52:12,490
it's going to be cyclical in nature.
The way it happens,

1914
01:52:13,090 --> 01:52:18,090
the way people deal with these horrible
emotions is they go down and then they

1915
01:52:19,481 --> 01:52:24,250
come up and then they go down and they
come up. And, and when they go down,

1916
01:52:24,251 --> 01:52:27,180
when your emotions go down and when
you get dragged into the, the, the,

1917
01:52:27,181 --> 01:52:30,100
the mindset of loss,

1918
01:52:31,210 --> 01:52:35,050
then I think the best thing to do is
just embrace it. Grab it, say yeah.

1919
01:52:35,051 --> 01:52:38,380
And she's like I said,
shake your fist at the sky and scream

1920
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:41,800
and then let it out.

1921
01:52:41,830 --> 01:52:46,130
Get it out and then pick it back
up and say to yourself, okay,

1922
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:48,590
that was horrible.
That's darkness,

1923
01:52:48,650 --> 01:52:51,530
that's evil that I couldn't control.

1924
01:52:51,590 --> 01:52:56,330
What can I control and how can I have
the best possible view and what can I

1925
01:52:56,331 --> 01:53:00,980
learn from all this that's going to make
me a better person with a better life

1926
01:53:01,100 --> 01:53:04,700
to live the best I can in their memories?

1927
01:53:05,470 --> 01:53:10,360
No ma'am. And even men and men,

1928
01:53:10,361 --> 01:53:11,470
when you're in the situation,
like,

1929
01:53:11,471 --> 01:53:15,700
especially with working out where
your daughter is like, you know,

1930
01:53:15,701 --> 01:53:18,070
in the hospital or whatever
and you're like, yeah,

1931
01:53:18,071 --> 01:53:20,320
I haven't worked out this whole week.
It's like,

1932
01:53:20,321 --> 01:53:23,500
who cares about worked out to your
daughter's in the hospital? You don't, Oh,

1933
01:53:23,501 --> 01:53:27,100
you didn't make it did you do to like,
you don't care about Jujitsu anymore.

1934
01:53:27,190 --> 01:53:31,840
You just care about this one thing, you
know. But again, just like how you said,

1935
01:53:31,841 --> 01:53:35,440
it's like, so it's like this big burden
in life because really, you know,

1936
01:53:35,441 --> 01:53:39,880
you've done a lot of time.
Your kids are like all you have really,

1937
01:53:39,910 --> 01:53:43,510
it feels like, so if you don't
have them who hears about Jujitsu,

1938
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:45,920
who cares about working? I
don't have anything. You know,

1939
01:53:46,120 --> 01:53:47,740
there's no reason to even do them.
Rarely.

1940
01:53:48,220 --> 01:53:53,220
But aside from the fact is there is more
like to your life and in fact the more

1941
01:53:56,380 --> 01:54:01,030
your whole life beside them is for them,

1942
01:54:01,090 --> 01:54:05,800
you know, so you gotta you gotta
of you gotta keep that I think.

1943
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:07,233
Yeah,
no doubt.

1944
01:54:10,760 --> 01:54:14,420
Yeah. And I think that's always an
important thing to remember is that

1945
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:21,040
if you surrender to all that bad,

1946
01:54:24,390 --> 01:54:29,370
evil darkness,
that's the legacy.

1947
01:54:29,371 --> 01:54:31,950
That's the example.
That's what you're showing.

1948
01:54:33,270 --> 01:54:34,470
As opposed to

1949
01:54:37,530 --> 01:54:40,910
showing the legacy and
showing the example of

1950
01:54:44,990 --> 01:54:48,050
not giving up,
of moving forward,

1951
01:54:49,310 --> 01:54:54,310
of driving on and doing the best you can
with life and with the things that are

1952
01:54:57,501 --> 01:55:00,530
good. And again, having the attitude

1953
01:55:02,330 --> 01:55:07,330
to control the things you can control
and put them in the best possible light

1954
01:55:09,950 --> 01:55:10,783
that you can.

1955
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:15,390
Yeah. And it's a, and it's
a spectrum, you know, I mean

1956
01:55:16,930 --> 01:55:19,650
it kind of puts into perspective,
in my opinion,

1957
01:55:21,150 --> 01:55:25,320
why you should do the best you
can when things are going good.

1958
01:55:26,220 --> 01:55:29,020
Yeah. Cause they're not
always going to go good. Yeah.

1959
01:55:31,110 --> 01:55:35,640
That's my opinion anyway.
Speaking of doing the best you can,

1960
01:55:38,460 --> 01:55:42,180
hey look, working out, we
know, obvious, obvious workout.

1961
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:47,630
We're good. Hard to, you
know, I mean maybe not every
single day working on heart,

1962
01:55:47,631 --> 01:55:51,540
but workup and when you do workout hard,
you might need some supplementation.

1963
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:55,620
I think. I wasn't a supplement guy,
I wasn't before you know this, right?

1964
01:55:56,910 --> 01:55:58,540
I might've mentioned it,
everyone knows,

1965
01:56:01,410 --> 01:56:04,080
but now I am a supplement guy.
Happy to say,

1966
01:56:04,081 --> 01:56:07,560
not the kind of supplement guy who's
like, Hey, take this power gainer. Hey,

1967
01:56:07,590 --> 01:56:09,510
what kind of protein powder you take?

1968
01:56:09,511 --> 01:56:13,380
But even though I'm not against protein
powder, I don't take in. But nonetheless,

1969
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:17,130
you know what I'm talking about?
Krill oil.

1970
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:23,780
I'm gonna say to my father in law's
name is Ross. I'm sorry for not heating.

1971
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:26,930
All of you is heating,
heating, his just advice.

1972
01:56:27,140 --> 01:56:30,230
Can you heat advice or is it just morning?
Okay.

1973
01:56:30,860 --> 01:56:34,820
So you can heat warnings and advice.
I should have heated Ross's advice.

1974
01:56:34,850 --> 01:56:37,880
My father in law about the Krill oil

1975
01:56:39,970 --> 01:56:44,010
eventually chocolate turned me
back onto it or further onto it.

1976
01:56:44,011 --> 01:56:48,600
So I'm on it now. I think he'd
be happy literally on it on it.

1977
01:56:48,990 --> 01:56:53,940
Dot Collin intended anyway on it is the
company. If you didn't know already,

1978
01:56:54,270 --> 01:56:59,270
I get Jocko gets Krill oil from on it
on a.com if you want 10% off all these

1979
01:57:01,771 --> 01:57:05,520
supplements, which are what?
Shroom Tech K shroom tech,

1980
01:57:05,521 --> 01:57:07,740
good for oxygen uptake is what it is.

1981
01:57:08,610 --> 01:57:11,730
So when you're doing these
hardcore metcons Jujitsu,

1982
01:57:12,180 --> 01:57:15,630
your body takes up the oxygen
easier, more, more efficiently.

1983
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:21,580
Cordyceps, mushroom, just some science
for you. Right then strong bone.

1984
01:57:21,581 --> 01:57:23,520
That helped me. But I had this, um,

1985
01:57:24,060 --> 01:57:26,850
and I kind of want it to report this
before but I didn't want to take too much

1986
01:57:26,851 --> 01:57:30,780
time and the jury is still kind of
out on it. But so I had this tendon,

1987
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:34,650
itis kind of situation and it's weird.
It wasn't in like a normal place they can,

1988
01:57:34,651 --> 01:57:39,651
your elbow was in my deltoid muscle
where it inserts into the humerus bone,

1989
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:44,720
which is your like bone under your bicep.
And it was like tendonitis, tennis,

1990
01:57:44,730 --> 01:57:47,850
like in the kind of like I'm not injured,
I'm not out. But I would warm up more.

1991
01:57:47,851 --> 01:57:50,130
I got to rub on it and all
this stuff and I'm lifting,

1992
01:57:50,140 --> 01:57:52,920
I'm not going to take days off
if I'm not injured. So Brett,

1993
01:57:52,921 --> 01:57:55,350
this thing wasn't going to get better.
That's the thing about tendinitis.

1994
01:57:55,380 --> 01:57:58,050
Like if you keep lifting hard on it,
it just simply won't go away.

1995
01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:01,100
It's the whole reason this tendinitis
cause you're lifting hard on it, you know,

1996
01:58:01,750 --> 01:58:03,060
and I'd rather see it's not going away.

1997
01:58:03,061 --> 01:58:05,430
I'm just going to have to live
with it or wait for, you know,

1998
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:07,740
the time where I'd done, I don't
have to skip work cuts, whatever,

1999
01:58:07,741 --> 01:58:11,520
but I'm on the strong bone. I'm like I
strong bone that's see what up, you know,

2000
01:58:11,730 --> 01:58:15,840
do your thing. I'm not saying it
was because of the strong bone,

2001
01:58:15,841 --> 01:58:20,040
but nonetheless the tendonitis, it's not
completely gone. I'm be honest with you,

2002
01:58:20,070 --> 01:58:23,070
but it's pretty much gone.
I'm warming up normal.

2003
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:28,400
I'm a believer of this John Boom. Thanks
for turning me onto that check Jocko.

2004
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:30,630
Anyway,
go on there.

2005
01:58:30,631 --> 01:58:34,590
There's a lot of good stuff for a lot
of good things from supplements and

2006
01:58:34,591 --> 01:58:36,150
there's workout stuff on there too.

2007
01:58:36,510 --> 01:58:39,630
So I already had weights

2008
01:58:40,840 --> 01:58:41,860
and gym membership,

2009
01:58:42,610 --> 01:58:45,220
but when you go on there,
you see the stuff that they have.

2010
01:58:45,221 --> 01:58:46,210
You're going to get some of that too.

2011
01:58:46,240 --> 01:58:48,730
Cause it's not like normal
like kettle bells, you know,

2012
01:58:48,731 --> 01:58:52,450
there's all the cool ones and
there's info too on this stuff.

2013
01:58:52,451 --> 01:58:56,410
Like I understand that you know,
a lot of people, a lot of us,

2014
01:58:56,440 --> 01:58:59,800
we want more info than just Ooh joke.
Who takes it? So I'm going to take it.

2015
01:59:00,790 --> 01:59:02,260
Some of us that are like that anyway,

2016
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:05,080
we need more info so
there's info on the website.

2017
01:59:06,910 --> 01:59:07,360
Be careful.

2018
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:11,140
You can get stuck on there because it's
real interesting and in depth by the way,

2019
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:13,210
so just be careful with that.

2020
01:59:13,340 --> 01:59:17,170
You know on it.com/jocko
I recommend the Krill oil.

2021
01:59:17,350 --> 01:59:20,380
Big Time to me, if you're not on the
Krill oil, you're, you're behind.

2022
01:59:20,381 --> 01:59:23,830
You're like a good one to two
steps behind, like steps, steps,

2023
01:59:23,860 --> 01:59:26,560
not like a half step,
like if you're behind.

2024
01:59:27,550 --> 01:59:29,740
If I had a twin brother,
which I do,

2025
01:59:31,390 --> 01:59:35,050
you give us a five year period,
two year period, I'm on Krill oil.

2026
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:39,130
He's not on Krill oil. We do the same
exact workout program, same lifestyle.

2027
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:43,090
I'm way ahead of him. When out of him we
were more functional. This is factual.

2028
01:59:43,340 --> 01:59:46,400
I that's it's, this is
my hypothesis. Oh, okay.

2029
01:59:46,990 --> 01:59:50,660
It's hypothetic Jadon curler. I
don't, yeah, he's on Krill oil,

2030
01:59:50,661 --> 01:59:54,700
but he don't have that same, he doesn't
get after it physically as much as I do.

2031
01:59:55,870 --> 02:00:00,430
So this, yeah, it's hard to have that for
a basis of comparison for the Krill oil.

2032
02:00:00,790 --> 02:00:03,400
Nonetheless, a good stuff on there. And
the good thing about audit, you can,

2033
02:00:03,401 --> 02:00:06,940
I can say this with pretty much with
absolute certainty at this point is that

2034
02:00:06,941 --> 02:00:10,870
it's the good one. It's good stuff
because supplements in general,

2035
02:00:12,730 --> 02:00:14,830
I don't want to mention any store names,

2036
02:00:14,831 --> 02:00:17,830
but you know when you go in the meathead
bodybuilders store a lot of those

2037
02:00:17,831 --> 02:00:19,600
supplements or are there whack,

2038
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:25,420
they just have like sparkly like labels
and stuff in their junk on it is not

2039
02:00:25,421 --> 02:00:29,440
like that. Um, get 10%
off. If you want 10% off,

2040
02:00:29,710 --> 02:00:34,710
go on it.com/jocko that's a good
way to support this podcast as well.

2041
02:00:35,020 --> 02:00:37,830
Another Good Way to support my pee.

2042
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:42,840
He knows what's interesting is get
you read your review books on here.

2043
02:00:42,970 --> 02:00:45,640
And sometimes, actually a lot of
times when you have the guests,

2044
02:00:45,641 --> 02:00:49,840
you actually have their book
and you read their book to them,

2045
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:53,500
which is like a,
that was,

2046
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:57,250
and I think probably talked about this,
but when we had Jody medic,

2047
02:00:57,251 --> 02:01:00,700
that was the first time it happened.
Jodi came on and you know,

2048
02:01:00,701 --> 02:01:03,130
I had this book and I was like,
okay,

2049
02:01:03,131 --> 02:01:06,880
well should I have him read
this or should I read this?

2050
02:01:07,150 --> 02:01:09,580
Or I just wasn't quite sure.

2051
02:01:09,581 --> 02:01:12,910
And it seemed like the
common sense answer would be,

2052
02:01:13,030 --> 02:01:15,180
Jodi read this section of your book,
right?

2053
02:01:15,181 --> 02:01:17,500
Or it's kind of like a common sense
answer and then you can talk about it.

2054
02:01:17,950 --> 02:01:20,710
And for some reason my gut told me,

2055
02:01:21,010 --> 02:01:24,220
don't know Jocko read it.
I read right.

2056
02:01:25,060 --> 02:01:29,950
And as soon as we got, you
know, probably, I don't know,

2057
02:01:29,951 --> 02:01:32,950
halfway through it Jody said,

2058
02:01:33,190 --> 02:01:37,100
you know something like man here and
you read this is like crazy to hear.

2059
02:01:37,110 --> 02:01:42,110
And it's true when you hear
someone else read something to you,

2060
02:01:42,890 --> 02:01:46,220
it's, it's different.
It's different. Yeah. So,

2061
02:01:46,610 --> 02:01:49,040
so that's what I've done every time since,
you know,

2062
02:01:49,041 --> 02:01:51,840
when we had colonel reader on
here and he said the same thing.

2063
02:01:52,900 --> 02:01:54,020
It's hard when he usually,
you know,

2064
02:01:54,021 --> 02:01:57,890
he's like he's saying the most unemotional
way is that when you're reading this

2065
02:01:57,891 --> 02:02:01,920
to me it's extremely emotional
for me to hear. Yeah. We can,

2066
02:02:03,030 --> 02:02:07,550
you know, but it's, and, and same thing
with, with uh, Captain Plumb, you know,

2067
02:02:07,551 --> 02:02:11,660
same thing as well. Yeah. Yeah. So it's,

2068
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:14,870
it's really interesting the way
that works. And it's definitely,

2069
02:02:14,871 --> 02:02:18,400
it's unbelievable to have the
author sitting there. Yeah.

2070
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:23,360
And to have my spin. Yeah. Cause
that's what it is. Right? It's my,

2071
02:02:23,361 --> 02:02:25,130
it's the way I hear it.
Yeah.

2072
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:30,550
And for them to hear the way I hear it,
they,

2073
02:02:30,750 --> 02:02:34,230
it, it hits them from a different
angle. Right. So I think that's,

2074
02:02:34,231 --> 02:02:38,190
I think that's where the, the
interesting, powerful part comes from.

2075
02:02:39,220 --> 02:02:42,570
Yeah. It is very interesting. And
it's interesting to watch it because,

2076
02:02:42,571 --> 02:02:43,201
and you know,
you,

2077
02:02:43,201 --> 02:02:46,230
you're a little bit different than a
typical person just reading a book,

2078
02:02:46,231 --> 02:02:50,280
you know, so you really get the to
me is what it feels like is like,

2079
02:02:51,570 --> 02:02:54,420
that's kind of how the book
is supposed to feel. You know,

2080
02:02:54,510 --> 02:02:57,940
like when you read it or whatever. So
you know where the point is like, oh,

2081
02:02:57,941 --> 02:02:59,940
I think a lot of people feel
that. So you know, they say,

2082
02:02:59,970 --> 02:03:02,870
oh I want to go get this book. But they're
like, oh, what was that book again?

2083
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:05,610
I got to rewind it. So anyway, you don't
have to do that. Just go on our website,

2084
02:03:05,640 --> 02:03:08,220
[inaudible] dot com there's
a section on the top books,

2085
02:03:08,550 --> 02:03:11,310
boom there they are all
the books by episode

2086
02:03:12,870 --> 02:03:15,960
whom you can get them in and when you
buy your books through their support,

2087
02:03:15,961 --> 02:03:20,210
the podcast as well. So
boom, double, double edge,

2088
02:03:20,211 --> 02:03:24,780
double gravitational hooks. Like no,
it's a two pronged. Yeah. What if,

2089
02:03:25,220 --> 02:03:28,700
what if you weren't getting a book? You're
getting like duct tape, anything? Yeah,

2090
02:03:28,940 --> 02:03:33,020
so that's thing. Yes there are Amazon
click through situations. So, yeah,

2091
02:03:33,050 --> 02:03:35,870
even if before you do shopping, boom,
just click through. We've got banners,

2092
02:03:35,871 --> 02:03:39,830
Amazon manners all upon their click there.
But most people they do the books,

2093
02:03:39,860 --> 02:03:42,120
you know. But yeah, if you're doing
your shopping as well, do that.

2094
02:03:42,260 --> 02:03:46,250
Good software clubs, golf clubs, whatever
you do cameras and some people don't.

2095
02:03:46,251 --> 02:03:50,390
Some pretty cool high ticket, high dollar
items. Yeah. Which is very impactful.

2096
02:03:50,660 --> 02:03:53,900
And in the low ticket items,
low lower cost items,

2097
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:57,530
you might not think it's a big deal,
but then when a bunch of people do it,

2098
02:03:57,531 --> 02:04:02,330
it is a big deal and it's a very, very
helpful yeah. To the podcast. Yup. Good.

2099
02:04:02,331 --> 02:04:05,530
With spark [inaudible] boom,
a little bit.

2100
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:10,040
Also good way to support this
podcast is to subscribed.

2101
02:04:10,041 --> 02:04:14,780
Seems obvious. I know. But you know,
if you haven't subscribed on iTunes,

2102
02:04:14,840 --> 02:04:15,890
Google play,
stitcher.

2103
02:04:17,830 --> 02:04:18,663
Okay.

2104
02:04:18,820 --> 02:04:21,850
What's the other one that I keep
missing? I don't know. Hey man,

2105
02:04:21,851 --> 02:04:24,900
whatever podcast those before
you that I post almost.

2106
02:04:24,910 --> 02:04:26,710
It's something about soundcloud.
I gotta look into it.

2107
02:04:26,711 --> 02:04:29,940
I don't think that that's the subscribed
podcast situation. I don't know.

2108
02:04:29,980 --> 02:04:31,750
They're just audio for, I
don't, I don't know either.

2109
02:04:31,751 --> 02:04:33,390
So she didn't even say anything,
but nonetheless,

2110
02:04:33,400 --> 02:04:37,740
I look into it if in fact
people are committed to the
side owned cloud situation.

2111
02:04:38,580 --> 02:04:39,870
Anyway,
subscribe if you haven't already.

2112
02:04:39,871 --> 02:04:44,871
Also youtube if you want or are interested
in the video version of this podcast.

2113
02:04:45,750 --> 02:04:48,990
It's been on there since number seven.

2114
02:04:49,590 --> 02:04:52,800
I think seven was the first
video episode we are on there,

2115
02:04:52,801 --> 02:04:55,890
but they're just audio with
the picture of your head. No,

2116
02:04:55,891 --> 02:04:59,670
I can tear hit this button.
Right. It's his face it, but yeah,

2117
02:04:59,671 --> 02:05:03,660
if you're interested in that to
video from back then I do kind of,

2118
02:05:03,661 --> 02:05:05,670
I'm so bummed out we don't have it.
Yeah.

2119
02:05:05,671 --> 02:05:10,230
The closest you have is like a picture
of me trying to low was it hall is the

2120
02:05:10,230 --> 02:05:11,880
App Periscope? Periscope, yeah.
Yeah. I remember that one.

2121
02:05:11,881 --> 02:05:15,890
We did it go live on periscope.
We tried. No, we did. We did.

2122
02:05:15,891 --> 02:05:20,770
Did it live on periscope, Huh? Yeah.
Just try and capture that video. I know.

2123
02:05:21,900 --> 02:05:26,040
Nonetheless via video. That's the point
there. If you want to see, you know,

2124
02:05:27,460 --> 02:05:31,020
I guess what we look like
if you don't know. I don't
know. I feel like the guests,

2125
02:05:31,021 --> 02:05:35,070
that's where the value comes in for,
she'd like to see Ryder Hayden,

2126
02:05:35,071 --> 02:05:38,920
the heroes after it. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

2127
02:05:39,370 --> 02:05:42,600
That's a good one too. Cause he's like,
uh, like his stories, man. It's fun.

2128
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:45,910
He acts things out a little
bit as he said. Yeah.

2129
02:05:45,930 --> 02:05:49,830
But in this real mellow kind of nonchalant
bad ass way, you know, she's real good.

2130
02:05:50,590 --> 02:05:54,690
Um, but yeah, youtube, subscribe to
that one if you like. I'm also, yeah,

2131
02:05:54,691 --> 02:05:56,550
it's the video version of the podcast.
Yes.

2132
02:05:56,910 --> 02:06:01,770
But I will take a little excerpts
and we'll post those as well.

2133
02:06:01,950 --> 02:06:03,390
So you can, you know, if you'd like,

2134
02:06:03,420 --> 02:06:08,100
if you're in just sharing little
lessons with your friends or coworkers,

2135
02:06:08,110 --> 02:06:10,380
whatever, you can do that so you
don't have to share the whole podcast.

2136
02:06:10,900 --> 02:06:13,080
I'll put some other stuff on there.
Interesting stuff.

2137
02:06:14,010 --> 02:06:17,220
I think we'll think up some other
stuff just in relation to it.

2138
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:21,690
We've been spit balling about some stuff
anyway, if you want to see what that is.

2139
02:06:21,691 --> 02:06:26,610
Um, yeah, go on Youtube. It's not
like youtube cost money or does it?

2140
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:30,300
No, it doesn't. It's free
youtube. Red Customer. Yeah. Yeah.

2141
02:06:30,301 --> 02:06:33,730
We're not dealing with youtube
red and we're not doing that. No.

2142
02:06:34,020 --> 02:06:37,800
And I don't charge for content. Oh No, no,
we're not going to do that. Not Enough.

2143
02:06:37,810 --> 02:06:39,930
But I was thinking about getting
youtube, Bro. All right. Yeah,

2144
02:06:39,931 --> 02:06:43,020
that's a whole nother thing for
sure. But yeah, youtube subscribe.

2145
02:06:43,490 --> 02:06:47,040
You will support that way. That's
cool. Uh, also Jocko has a store,

2146
02:06:47,310 --> 02:06:51,330
it's called Jocko store Taco store.com.
So this,

2147
02:06:51,780 --> 02:06:56,190
I keep forgetting everybody's name, but
very clever guy said, hey, this was,

2148
02:06:57,480 --> 02:06:59,750
and then I went through and I was
like, Dang, I'm so, but I was like, ah,

2149
02:06:59,751 --> 02:07:04,080
it's not a Haiku. The Jocko story.
Yeah. So why don't you change it?

2150
02:07:04,081 --> 02:07:08,550
So it's a high coup because
it might, yeah, I guess. Okay,

2151
02:07:08,580 --> 02:07:11,450
here we go.
Also

2152
02:07:13,980 --> 02:07:15,000
Jocko has a store,

2153
02:07:15,330 --> 02:07:20,220
it's called the Jocko
Jocko store.com boom.

2154
02:07:20,221 --> 02:07:23,670
There was like cool. Nonetheless, jackals
store.com that's where you can get,

2155
02:07:23,671 --> 02:07:27,090
if you want shirts,
rash guards,

2156
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:32,760
hoodies,
some patches,

2157
02:07:32,820 --> 02:07:36,070
velcro, regulation size and color.
So I'm some women's stuff on

2158
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:39,490
there. Anyway, the point there is if
you like t shirts you want to represent,

2159
02:07:39,850 --> 02:07:44,290
get a shirt, boom, good
support. They're good shirts
too. They're not the free time.

2160
02:07:44,300 --> 02:07:47,260
When you put on get after t shirt.
Yeah.

2161
02:07:47,650 --> 02:07:50,920
Do you get a little bit? Yeah.
You want to get after it mark.

2162
02:07:51,190 --> 02:07:54,640
And actually the eight,
that actually sounds kind of funny,

2163
02:07:54,641 --> 02:07:58,150
but when you think about
it's super obvious. So like,
you know how like, I mean

2164
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:05,530
it's a litterer literature thing.
Well there's a literature thing.

2165
02:08:06,070 --> 02:08:10,540
It's called something. It's
called something like the
dressing of the warrior.

2166
02:08:10,580 --> 02:08:12,730
Yeah. And you'll see it in
movies. They do the movies.

2167
02:08:12,731 --> 02:08:14,410
We should have guy
putting his boots on him,

2168
02:08:14,411 --> 02:08:18,730
putting his gear on and putting his sword
and picking up a shield that's dawning

2169
02:08:18,731 --> 02:08:19,241
his helmet.

2170
02:08:19,241 --> 02:08:24,241
They do everyone from knight movies to
gladiator movies to soldier movies in the

2171
02:08:25,630 --> 02:08:28,300
modern day. You'll see these scenes.
Well they do it in literature too,

2172
02:08:29,050 --> 02:08:32,260
so there's a little something that
there's little reality to that.

2173
02:08:32,261 --> 02:08:36,120
Like I'll tell you what used to
get me was flipping down. Sorry,

2174
02:08:36,190 --> 02:08:37,060
night vision goggles.

2175
02:08:37,090 --> 02:08:41,810
You're wearing them on your helmet and
they flip up when the lights are on,

2176
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:43,720
when you're, you know,
you're getting ready to go.

2177
02:08:43,810 --> 02:08:47,440
And then when it's time to go
flipped down your nods. And for me,

2178
02:08:47,960 --> 02:08:50,920
I like that was just games.
So game on,

2179
02:08:50,921 --> 02:08:54,430
it's so game on when you flip
down those nods. And so when we,

2180
02:08:54,490 --> 02:08:55,960
even when I got back
from my last deployment,

2181
02:08:55,961 --> 02:08:58,630
I'm working training and we'd go out,
we'd still be on night vision,

2182
02:08:58,631 --> 02:09:02,650
we'd go out at night to observe the
troops and run the opposing forces and all

2183
02:09:02,651 --> 02:09:03,484
that.

2184
02:09:03,580 --> 02:09:08,410
But I get out on the target area and flip
down my nods and I'd let go into full

2185
02:09:08,411 --> 02:09:10,240
combat load.
It's just so good.

2186
02:09:10,630 --> 02:09:15,630
So I think sometimes you put on a guitar
three shirt you sorta feel or something.

2187
02:09:15,970 --> 02:09:19,990
Yeah, I think it was gladiator.
That movie when they're like,

2188
02:09:20,710 --> 02:09:23,080
I dunno, it's like the
emperor or something came up.

2189
02:09:23,260 --> 02:09:26,260
And then there's like the small act of
defiance from the gladiator guy and then

2190
02:09:26,290 --> 02:09:28,990
all the guards behind them,
they'll flip down the thing and boom,

2191
02:09:28,991 --> 02:09:30,400
we're ready to go real quick.

2192
02:09:30,401 --> 02:09:33,150
I think he's glad eight or probably it
might've been something else. Nonetheless,

2193
02:09:33,160 --> 02:09:36,030
he had the modern version of
that right with these like,

2194
02:09:36,130 --> 02:09:38,910
and it did happen to me when
the first shirts came in,

2195
02:09:38,930 --> 02:09:40,700
the discipline equals
freedom. I was like, oh,

2196
02:09:40,701 --> 02:09:44,080
the shirts there and I put it on and
I want it to like go work out in it,

2197
02:09:44,240 --> 02:09:46,690
you know? And they make sense.
When you get a new rash guard,

2198
02:09:46,691 --> 02:09:48,960
it's like where you get a new key
or something and you're like, oh,

2199
02:09:48,970 --> 02:09:50,170
can't wait to go practice it.

2200
02:09:50,170 --> 02:09:53,750
My new geek kind of thing when they
were little kids get new shoes that can

2201
02:09:53,970 --> 02:09:57,730
write faster. In football, when
we split in Pop Warner football,

2202
02:09:57,910 --> 02:10:00,550
we'd get the new shoes for the season.
I can't wait to go to practice.

2203
02:10:00,551 --> 02:10:03,160
Practice super hardens.
It sucks do especially as a little kid,

2204
02:10:03,430 --> 02:10:07,120
but you just want to, when you get
that, that new stuff nonetheless.

2205
02:10:07,121 --> 02:10:10,990
So like I said, chocolate
store.com get yourself a new shirt.

2206
02:10:11,860 --> 02:10:13,150
You get the one that says get after it.

2207
02:10:13,151 --> 02:10:16,650
Guess what you're going to
really want to do, get after it.

2208
02:10:18,190 --> 02:10:21,910
Some other ones on there. Pretty cool I
think, and the good their quality shirts.

2209
02:10:21,940 --> 02:10:23,230
That's,
in my opinion,

2210
02:10:23,231 --> 02:10:27,310
that's even more important than what
it says on them cause they're wearable.

2211
02:10:27,610 --> 02:10:30,190
I can print like,
yeah,

2212
02:10:30,191 --> 02:10:33,350
Jack was cool sayings on a junk shirt
you were at one time. You're like,

2213
02:10:33,370 --> 02:10:34,070
all right,
you

2214
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:36,320
know me. Be aware of that again,
but it's not very wearable.

2215
02:10:36,321 --> 02:10:39,470
I don't look that good in it.
It's not the case with these ones.

2216
02:10:39,471 --> 02:10:40,310
These ones look good.

2217
02:10:40,340 --> 02:10:44,150
I've had multiple people say it's my
favorite shirt to wear it because I look

2218
02:10:44,151 --> 02:10:48,050
good in that. That's kind of a shirt
with the first round of travel mugs.

2219
02:10:49,950 --> 02:10:52,190
The silver ones.
Oh yeah.

2220
02:10:52,430 --> 02:10:57,110
They were not as high
quality as what we went to.

2221
02:10:57,690 --> 02:11:01,400
They said no. They said discipline equals
freedom on him and the silver mugs.

2222
02:11:01,430 --> 02:11:05,030
They said discipline equals freedom.
They looked pretty cool,

2223
02:11:05,750 --> 02:11:10,050
but we needed higher cost. Higher
Quality. Yeah. Yeah, so it's, yeah,

2224
02:11:10,100 --> 02:11:15,070
essentially the same thing and you get
the monkey like cool travel mug is going

2225
02:11:15,071 --> 02:11:20,071
to go in the distance that's going
to replace your whole cup cupboard.

2226
02:11:20,720 --> 02:11:24,590
It's straight up. It did with me and
I didn't even expect that. But yeah,

2227
02:11:24,650 --> 02:11:29,270
30 ounces and it fits in your couple of
doing your car too. What's the black on?

2228
02:11:29,271 --> 02:11:33,890
Black? Black on black discipline equals
freedom. No one can see it. Yeah.

2229
02:11:33,891 --> 02:11:37,520
You except for you. Well, the
owner. Nah, you can see it.

2230
02:11:37,521 --> 02:11:41,930
Here's the good thing about
it. It's black. It's east
seat. Look at it. It's black.

2231
02:11:41,960 --> 02:11:46,220
It's not shiny. It's black. Fresh
and shiny. Black and then, yeah.

2232
02:11:46,221 --> 02:11:47,750
Then the logo and stuff,
his shiny black.

2233
02:11:47,751 --> 02:11:49,950
So people have to look a little
extra hard to see it. Yeah,

2234
02:11:50,450 --> 02:11:53,660
but there's a subtlety to it that's
powerful. It's for you. It's for you.

2235
02:11:53,661 --> 02:11:57,680
It's looks dope. They call it murdered
out and the car's black with black rims.

2236
02:11:58,220 --> 02:12:00,770
Anyway, it looks good and it's
double insulated. Dealt with.

2237
02:12:00,771 --> 02:12:04,460
Is that double insulated is, that's what
it's called? Yeah. When, yeah, your ice.

2238
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:07,540
You put ice water in there. You leave
it over night. Next morning still.

2239
02:12:07,550 --> 02:12:11,060
You still have ice water. Even if
it's a hot night, even if thought day,

2240
02:12:12,290 --> 02:12:15,290
it's amazing. I left my
name, my car. You know,

2241
02:12:15,291 --> 02:12:19,540
you go into the grocery store,
you spend a lot of time in negotiation.

2242
02:12:22,390 --> 02:12:27,220
No, no. I was coming back from somewhere,
left it in my car with I, it was just ice.

2243
02:12:27,230 --> 02:12:30,470
I drink all the water and left it in.

2244
02:12:30,471 --> 02:12:34,970
My car came out later that evening.
Boom.

2245
02:12:34,971 --> 02:12:39,140
I still in the car today. It's amazing.
It's a miracle. Anyway, those are good.

2246
02:12:39,141 --> 02:12:43,700
High Quality, BPA free,
all that stuff. Anyway,

2247
02:12:44,060 --> 02:12:46,400
Jaclyn, store.com if you
didn't know already. Also,

2248
02:12:46,700 --> 02:12:51,700
good way to support yourself and this
podcast by happenstance is psychological.

2249
02:12:52,450 --> 02:12:55,250
A psychological warfare is what it's
called. If you don't know what that is,

2250
02:12:55,251 --> 02:12:59,570
it's an album with tracks of Jocko telling
you how to get through your moments

2251
02:12:59,571 --> 02:13:03,680
of weakness in the event of you
having a moment of weakness,

2252
02:13:04,310 --> 02:13:08,450
getting up early, procrastinating,
even being created.

2253
02:13:08,451 --> 02:13:12,350
It's like for everything being creative,
like how can,

2254
02:13:12,770 --> 02:13:17,210
how can you get talked out of writer's
block? How can you get talked out of that?

2255
02:13:17,720 --> 02:13:18,553
It's weird,
right?

2256
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:22,460
You will be talked out of writer's
block and right into creativity. Yes,

2257
02:13:22,461 --> 02:13:23,090
exactly right.

2258
02:13:23,090 --> 02:13:26,420
And same thing with workouts anyway for
all the little moments of weakness that

2259
02:13:26,421 --> 02:13:31,260
you might have. Don't worry Jack was
there, get it. Psychological warfare,

2260
02:13:31,261 --> 02:13:34,620
you can even buy the individual
tracks do let's say your life just no,

2261
02:13:34,621 --> 02:13:35,820
but that's not as good of a deal.

2262
02:13:37,130 --> 02:13:41,280
But I mean really 99 cents. Yes it
is a good deal. It's a great deal.

2263
02:13:41,281 --> 02:13:44,940
Regardless in my opinion. Cause Look Kid,
my whole thing wasn't the wake up early.

2264
02:13:44,941 --> 02:13:47,040
It was going from not
working out to where,

2265
02:13:47,041 --> 02:13:50,340
you know how it's like okay I've got to
work out today but I'm on the computer,

2266
02:13:50,341 --> 02:13:51,121
I'm doing something.

2267
02:13:51,121 --> 02:13:55,110
And I'm like this is important to exactly
what you should really focus on my

2268
02:13:55,111 --> 02:13:57,480
craft. Right? Yeah, exactly right.

2269
02:13:57,481 --> 02:14:01,270
So the workout day becomes
arrest day impromptu, you know,

2270
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:02,880
and that was kind of my thing.

2271
02:14:03,900 --> 02:14:07,720
But so there's a track for that,
you know?

2272
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:11,040
So if all I need is really that,
try the Diet thing,

2273
02:14:11,370 --> 02:14:14,370
I'm not that weak when it comes to
like the Diet stuff. So you know,

2274
02:14:14,371 --> 02:14:16,950
so maybe I don't need it,
but I'm not saying to do that.

2275
02:14:16,951 --> 02:14:20,430
I'm saying there's that option. So
he gets the one, it's on iTunes,

2276
02:14:20,490 --> 02:14:24,510
it's on Amazon music.
Google play,

2277
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:29,100
Google play pretty much anywhere where
they sell music, MP three online mp3s,

2278
02:14:29,160 --> 02:14:31,900
boom. It's on there. It's called the
cycle of people that want to alarm arm

2279
02:14:31,900 --> 02:14:36,360
clocks. So people was one an alarm
clock or ringtone. You told him no,

2280
02:14:36,361 --> 02:14:37,300
no alarm clock.

2281
02:14:37,301 --> 02:14:41,720
If you want to wake up to like
someone telling you to get up that,

2282
02:14:41,810 --> 02:14:43,810
then that's someone that's taking Jocko.
Yes,

2283
02:14:44,370 --> 02:14:47,230
because people want me to
do something like that, but
I'm like, we already did it.

2284
02:14:47,231 --> 02:14:50,410
That's one of the reasons why we did this.
A psychological warfare. Yeah. So you,

2285
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:53,710
yeah. You download that Pacific file
to your phone and then you, yeah,

2286
02:14:53,730 --> 02:14:57,550
you'll make it make it to your alarm
clock. Yeah. Yeah. Psychological warfare,

2287
02:14:57,630 --> 02:14:58,680
Jocko Willink.
Boom.

2288
02:14:59,080 --> 02:15:04,080
You can also get Jocko white tea on Amazon
and people ask if I ever drink energy

2289
02:15:07,031 --> 02:15:11,170
drinks and the answer's yes,
but drink Jocko white tea,

2290
02:15:12,130 --> 02:15:13,550
that's my energy drink.
Sure.

2291
02:15:14,290 --> 02:15:19,290
Don't need any other energy drinks
that actually SAP your energy.

2292
02:15:19,630 --> 02:15:23,710
Once they're,
once they're crash hits you talk away to,

2293
02:15:23,711 --> 02:15:25,870
that's not going to happen.
You'll be going strong way.

2294
02:15:25,871 --> 02:15:28,270
The warrior cured the book.

2295
02:15:29,590 --> 02:15:33,310
I wish I had when I was a kid.
That shows kids the path.

2296
02:15:34,160 --> 02:15:38,980
You can get that book as well as for
adults that would need to get on the path.

2297
02:15:39,640 --> 02:15:42,520
There's another book coming out.
October 20th,

2298
02:15:42,520 --> 02:15:45,820
2017 discipline equals freedom field
manual. It's the path that's it.

2299
02:15:47,170 --> 02:15:48,670
Extreme ownership of course,

2300
02:15:49,090 --> 02:15:53,200
combat leadership from the battlefield
and translated into strategies and

2301
02:15:53,201 --> 02:15:57,610
tactics that can be applied in any
leadership situation. Extreme ownership.

2302
02:15:58,780 --> 02:16:01,240
Get it and then did it

2303
02:16:03,700 --> 02:16:06,760
also do.
You can also get echelon,

2304
02:16:06,761 --> 02:16:11,410
front leadership and management consulting
into your company. You got Leif Babin,

2305
02:16:11,590 --> 02:16:15,520
you got JP do now.
You got Dave Burke and you got me.

2306
02:16:16,360 --> 02:16:21,360
You can contact us@infoatechelonfront.com
of course the muster leadership

2307
02:16:22,961 --> 02:16:27,220
conference, but not your
normal conference. It's
not your normal conference,

2308
02:16:27,760 --> 02:16:29,760
so don't whatever your of a conference,

2309
02:16:29,761 --> 02:16:32,320
because I've spoken at a bunch
of conferences that conference.

2310
02:16:32,410 --> 02:16:35,800
It's not that it's different. It's
different. The normal conference,

2311
02:16:36,010 --> 02:16:39,730
you're waiting for the break and then
you're going to disappear to your hotel

2312
02:16:39,731 --> 02:16:43,180
room for like 45 minutes waiting for
the happy hour, all that other stuff.

2313
02:16:43,210 --> 02:16:47,800
That's not, that's not what we're doing
here at the conference. At, at the muster,

2314
02:16:48,930 --> 02:16:50,470
the muster starts at eight
o'clock in the morning.

2315
02:16:51,310 --> 02:16:55,330
Everyone's there at seven o'clock in
the morning after we get done with PT.

2316
02:16:55,750 --> 02:16:57,100
Everyone's there at seven
o'clock in the morning,

2317
02:16:57,550 --> 02:17:02,410
including all of us were hanging out.
We, when we start at eight o'clock,

2318
02:17:02,411 --> 02:17:04,600
we start at eight o'clock.
Boom. It's go time.

2319
02:17:04,630 --> 02:17:09,190
So it's not just your kind
of typical conference thing.

2320
02:17:09,191 --> 02:17:12,340
We get after it. Knowledge,
interaction, solving problems.

2321
02:17:12,341 --> 02:17:16,510
We go and we go hard. I just peeked out
the microphone. I don't do that normally,

2322
02:17:16,511 --> 02:17:21,370
but we go and we'd go hard. Next one
is in August, or sorry, in Austin,

2323
02:17:21,371 --> 02:17:25,840
Texas. July 13th and 14th at
the Omni Barton Creek resort,

2324
02:17:25,841 --> 02:17:28,690
which only has 300 people.
We're a little over.

2325
02:17:28,780 --> 02:17:33,670
We're over halfway sold out right
now. Um, so register quickly.

2326
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:35,830
If you can't make that,

2327

and 15th for muster at zero zero four

2328

2329

Thanks for everything that
you do for us to the police,

2335

Thank you for supporting.
Thank you for spreading the word.

2339
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:38,840
Thank you for getting up early and thanks
for working harder than your enemy.

2340
02:18:40,460 --> 02:18:42,410
And as Echo said earlier,

2341
02:18:44,010 --> 02:18:49,010
thanks for taking advantage of when times
are good because times will not always

2342
02:18:50,551 --> 02:18:51,384
be good.

2343
02:18:55,320 --> 02:18:59,930
So until next time,
this is echo and Jocko

2344
02:19:01,710 --> 02:19:01,980
out.
