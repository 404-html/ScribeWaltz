1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,090
This is Jocko podcast number
30 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:07,890
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,930
And what we have this
evening is straight Q and a.

4
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:23,710
The last podcast that we did on the
outstanding book called Platoon leader,

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,570
a memoir of combat of command in combat.

6
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,480
It just took me a long time to
get through it. Just a good book.

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,820
And I just kept every s word,
you know, like every time,

8
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:40,770
every page I read it.

9
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:43,180
So you've got people got here
that and people got to hear that.

10
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:44,980
People got to hear that.
And then the next thing you know,

11
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,720
you're two and a half hours deep.

12
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,340
And since so much of what
was pertained to leadership,

13
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,450
there was commentary with each section
and it was like, oh yeah, you know,

14
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,770
this is what's going on here.

15
00:00:56,771 --> 00:01:00,010
And I recognize that and I wish I would've
known that and know that could have

16
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:03,460
helped me here. So, uh,

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,520
went a little long and that made us
decide to just go ahead and turn that into

18
00:01:11,861 --> 00:01:12,970
one podcast.

19
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:18,210
And now here we are coming back
at you with podcast number 30,

20
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,640
which is straight Q and a.
Yeah.

21
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:24,280
There wasn't really one part of that
book review that I was like, oh,

22
00:01:24,281 --> 00:01:29,080
you could have left that out. No. In
the industry we call that getting after.

23
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,050
Indeed. So let's, uh, let's
take into some Q and a here.

24
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,180
Some questions that we've been asked.
You're going to kick this one off.

25
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:44,650
Yes sir. Eggo journals. Yes sir.
Question number one. First question.

26
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,390
Ductile as an aide to camp,
what were your duties?

27
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:55,470
What did you learn and why does that
position still exist in the 21st century

28
00:01:56,261 --> 00:01:59,410
military? Well, the aid to
count. Okay. So first of all,

29
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:02,890
in aid to camp is something
in the military that

30
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,130
it's almost, I mean to, to,

31
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:10,990
to put it in a very simple way that
people could understand it from,

32
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,840
it's an assistant.
It's like an executive assistant.

33
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,960
Where for me,
I was,

34
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,710
I was the admiral that's
in charge of all the seals.

35
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,920
I was his assistant. You know,
that's when an aid to campus. Now

36
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,650
the question is why does that position
still exist? Or what do you know?

37
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:36,190
What did you learn while I learned a ton,
no doubt about that.

38
00:02:36,191 --> 00:02:39,190
Why does the position still exist? I think
it's absolutely necessary. It's a good,

39
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,660
it's a, it's not fun. It's not a
fun job. And I work for a great guy,

40
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,020
but it's, but if you're working for
somebody that's not a great guy,

41
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:51,760
it's miserable. And even working for a
great guy, it's not exactly the dream job.

42
00:02:51,761 --> 00:02:56,050
It wasn't for me. So here's
what you do. The, the boss,

43
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,370
which is what we call, this is what we
called the Aba. We called them the boss.

44
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,770
Right? Um, so what we did was,

45
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:07,480
what I did was the boss is always
traveling and going different places,

46
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:11,320
going to the Pentagon, going to
visit, outstations, going overseas,

47
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:15,850
going just constantly going on travel
and visiting people and visiting troops.

48
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,220
And so I was the guy that
set up that travel. That's,

49
00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:23,830
that's what I did. I set up
the travel and then, you know,

50
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:27,190
communicating with wherever you're going
to visit my k, the admiral's coming in,

51
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,060
you know, what do you want us to do? Is
there anything we need to be heads up on?

52
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:36,061
So we'd take care of all that and set
it up and make sure that the travel

53
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:39,880
smooth, cause he's a really busy
guy. It's like a CEO, you know,

54
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:44,110
he's like the CEO of a big giant,
powerful worldwide company.

55
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,260
That's where he is. And so you're
trying to make the most of his time,

56
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:52,030
make sure we're not wasting his time
during travel. And so that's what I did.

57
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,110
So that's,
that's part of it.

58
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:57,580
And then the other piece
that's cool is your,

59
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,820
you're kind of like a,

60
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,450
a trusted advisor or you try and
build the trust so that he trusts you.

61
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,410
And they usually,

62
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,090
in our case usually often tried to find
guys that had come back from the front

63
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:14,500
lines and use them as the,
the aide.

64
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:19,630
And so I had, when I became the aide,
who was actually my commanding officer,

65
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,420
he, uh, who's, who's,

66
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,050
who's a friend of mine and who's a
great guy that always took care of me.

67
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,320
And he told me, he said, hey, my,

68
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:34,930
my final mission as the commanding
officer of seal team seven is to make sure

69
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:37,450
that you become the aid to the admiral.

70
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,390
And you know, I wasn't happy about it.
Cause again, you're, it's, it's an,

71
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:48,310
it's an administrative job. It's, you have
to wear a uniform every day, which was

72
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,990
2005.
And um,

73
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,580
but it was,
it was a good call that the debt,

74
00:04:57,581 --> 00:05:02,110
my commanding officer made me go do it
because I did learn a ton. You know, you,

75
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:03,800
you,
I had been in,

76
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,870
in the micro world of being a seal
platoon for my whole life. Right.

77
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:10,630
So that's all I did. And so yeah,
I didn't know anything else.

78
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:12,970
I didn't understand anything else. So
when you go, all of a sudden you're,

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,060
you're dealing with not only do you see
the big picture of the seal teams is

80
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:20,410
what I saw the big picture of the army
in the Special Operations Command and big

81
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:23,410
navy, like the regular navy.
We interacted with them a lot.

82
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:24,910
So I got to learn a ton.

83
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,660
I learned a ton about what I learned.

84
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,050
It's sorta like seeing behind the curtain,
you know,

85
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:33,340
you get to see behind the curtain,

86
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,790
the wizard and the what's going on in
the chambers. And basically, you know,

87
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:40,390
like how they make the sausage,
you reverbed that term, you know,

88
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,160
they say when they make sausage, like
you'll eat the sausage, it tastes good,

89
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:47,610
but you don't want to see
how they make it. So that's,

90
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,270
I got to see how they make the sausage.

91
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,020
I got to see behind the curtain
and I learned a ton of that.

92
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,310
You know,

93
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,040
I got to sit and like there was meetings
that I would sit in super high level

94
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:02,310
meetings with very powerful people in
the meetings and I would just be sitting

95
00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:06,560
in there listening and seeing how these
judgments were being made and assessing

96
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:11,561
the leadership and seeing what type of
leaders we had at the highest levels of

97
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,600
the Pentagon.
And as those pretty,

98
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,720
it was pretty interesting and
I definitely learned a lot. Um,

99
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,440
it, it was not fun because like I
said, there was a ton of travel.

100
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,420
You're wearing a uniform all the time,

101
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:31,421
which seals are pretty well known
for not wanting to wear uniforms,

102
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:36,980
real uniforms.
And there I'd probably worn a uniform,

103
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,240
a very small number of times.
I'm talking to my whole naval career,

104
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:46,010
a dress uniform.
I'd probably worn one 15 times.

105
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,530
I,
I don't know the number,

106
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:52,010
but it's a tiny number and all of a
sudden I'm at the working for the admiral.

107
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,170
I'm wearing a uniform every single day.

108
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,290
And there were some times we'd go on
a trip and I'd have to where there's

109
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,450
multiple different dress
uniforms in the navy.

110
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:02,960
And then most of the services we'd go
on some where I'd have to bring two or

111
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:07,700
three different dress uniforms. So my
uniforms, we're always ready. That was,

112
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,360
that was one thing that not too many
people could claim as you get really good

113
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:15,410
at your uniforms. Um, but there's,

114
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:18,770
there's also some things that are
pretty restrictive. Like for instance,

115
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,800
you're actually not allowed to
do personal favors for the boss.

116
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,000
Like I wasn't allowed because this idea,
the milk,

117
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,520
because they're very cautious that the
military senior people might abused

118
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:39,080
people in the military. Oh
yeah. And like I wasn't allowed,

119
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:43,190
for instance, I wasn't allowed
to go pick up his laundry.

120
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,980
Like if he got,
if he got his uniform's pressed and clean,

121
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,450
I wasn't allowed to go and run
to the store and pick it up.

122
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:51,980
If we were going on a trip
or something like you will,

123
00:07:51,981 --> 00:07:55,910
it wasn't allowed to do it.
We weren't allowed to fly First Class III.

124
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,250
The w there was only one time
we flew first class. That was,

125
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:03,740
we'd get upgrades after awhile because
we were traveling so much. But um,

126
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,380
so both of you guys couldn't or just
the just the, the aide to camp? No,

127
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:12,560
neither one of us. We wouldn't
fly first class. Yeah, it's,

128
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:15,680
it's the military sort of,

129
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,750
you know, we don't want that. They don't
want there to be fraud, waste and abuse,

130
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,640
which is actually ridiculous.

131
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:25,430
This guy is the equivalent of a CEO
of a big company and they don't,

132
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,300
they wouldn't get the guy first class
tickets to fly from San Diego to

133
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:32,840
Washington DC to go to the Pentagon
and brief some senior governmental

134
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:36,410
leadership fully. That's a good
philosophy though. No way thing. Yeah,

135
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:38,990
I know it's a good philosophy,
but uh, they should have,

136
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,170
I think he learned at that
point 30 something years
in the navy for that server

137
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,490
in his country and just to be,
you know, hey, you know what?

138
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:51,410
This guy should be well rested when he
shows up to brief congress, you know.

139
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,690
So, um, that was that.

140
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,050
And then the reason I think it's again
is because you got, you take a guy,

141
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,620
the old, the, the admiral there,

142
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,310
they're not going to usually or often
may not have been in recent combat

143
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,770
situations.
And so there's aid that's coming in.

144
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,740
He's coming off the battlefield so he
can say, Hey, saw hers is going on here.

145
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,690
Hey Sir, this is what
this is like, Hey sir,

146
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:15,210
this is some gear that we need
up on the front lines. Hey Sir,

147
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:19,800
this is what the front line troopers
think about this program that we're doing

148
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:23,670
or this a rule that's
being imposed upon us.

149
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:25,740
We need to change this or
we need to get it fixed.

150
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,040
So I had a great relationship with,
with,

151
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,550
with a boss when I was
running that job and,

152
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,750
and it was very beneficial for me on my
next appointment when I deployed Ramadi

153
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,940
and I knew the admiral.
I mean it was, you know,

154
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:43,941
he's the guy that's in charge of all
seals and there I was in Ramadi and you

155
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:49,200
know, there was times where we
talk directly, you know, uh,

156
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,520
he called me up and say, Hey,
what's going on? Or, you know,

157
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:57,550
after my guys got killed he called
me up directly and, and that,

158
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,860
that really meant a lot to me.

159
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,360
And I think it meant a lot to him too
because he had a connection with the guys

160
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:07,260
that were out there cause he knew
me and knew, you know, knew me well.

161
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,440
So I think that was, I think I was
very important and I think it's a,

162
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,040
it's a good job. I'm not going
to say you're going to like it.

163
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,950
If there's troopers out there
that are up for that job,

164
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,900
you're not going to like it if you're,

165
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:20,910
if you're a hardcore getting
after it kind of guy,

166
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,200
you're not going to like the job.

167
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,910
The people that actually in the scary
thing is the people that volunteer and

168
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:30,030
want to have that job are usually the
guys the animals don't want because that's

169
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:32,970
a guy that's like focused on
advancing his career and hey,

170
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:36,330
if I'm can be an aide then I'll know
the admiral and then and so you're not

171
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:37,920
going to, those are the
guys, the animals actually,

172
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,170
at least the avenue I worked for,
he didn't want any guys like that.

173
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,880
He wanted guys over and say,
Oh,

174
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,390
I want a guy that's going to come
kicking and screaming to this job

175
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,880
because he doesn't want to wear a uniform.
He wants to be in the field.

176
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:55,110
I want to be in the field. So that's,
that's kind of a, the aide to camp.

177
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:57,780
So if there's a trooper out there
that's it's going to get pushed in that

178
00:10:57,781 --> 00:11:01,500
position. You know, you
might have to do it. And

179
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,220
when you do it, you do the best that you
can win. The guy that took over for me,

180
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,320
he said, cause I was, you know, I was,

181
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:15,930
I've always been early to work or
when I was working for the boss,

182
00:11:15,931 --> 00:11:18,880
I wasn't even earlier because this
is, you know, I've, I've felt this,

183
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,720
this responsibility that, you know,
I got to take care of this guy.

184
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,960
He's taking care of all the seals. I got
to take care of him, right? This guy,

185
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,320
the more, the easier I make his job
to make it easier to make his life,

186
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,040
the more he can focus on taking care of
all the guys that are in the field and

187
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:35,060
all the seals.
And so when I,

188
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:38,910
I was getting show up even earlier
than I would normally show up and I was

189
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,320
double and triple and quadruple check
everything that was going on. And,

190
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,740
and when the guy came in to relieve
me and take my place and he said,

191
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,470
he said, you know, hey, how does the,

192
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,900
how does the boss react if you
dropped the ball on something?

193
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:01,450
And I said, I don't know. I don't know.

194
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,100
I didn't drop the ball. I mean
that's, that was, you know,

195
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:06,620
a lot of luck involved and I had some,

196
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:10,980
some other guys that were with me that
really helped me out. Uh, you know,

197
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:15,070
one guy in particular as a
civilian guy that is steady works,

198
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,070
has always worked there and worked
there for a long time and he was always

199
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:23,071
covering my tracks and help me not drop
the ball but I never dropped the ball.

200
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,280
It's kind of a good answer though,
cause that question because you know,

201
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,950
if you were like, Oh hey, well
he doesn't take it so hard.

202
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:33,430
Almost like that might plant something
in his mind where it may not be as

203
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:35,980
important every single time or
something like that. That's important.

204
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:38,770
Every time you can't drop the ball.
Got to keep it going.

205
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,060
Is it ever viewed by people,
whatever that, that job.

206
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:45,560
So like kind of emasculating or
something cause you're like, like,

207
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,880
like an assistant more so than
the, you know, I dunno. Maybe,

208
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,360
maybe somebody you've used it that way.
You know,

209
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,590
I want military guy that got tasks where
the job to take care of the senior seal

210
00:12:56,591 --> 00:13:01,420
officer and keep his day moving so
that he can take care of the troops.

211
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:05,380
I don't, I think that's
beneficial, like, right. I, I
didn't, I didn't feel that way.

212
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,060
And the other thing is you're not,
like I said,

213
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:09,370
you're not allowed to do certain things.

214
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,560
You're not allowed to do
personal things for him.

215
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,753
And even,

216
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,810
and the guy that I worked for
was very laid back and, uh,

217
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,580
I mean,

218
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,100
and part of the reason he was laid back
was because I'd never dropped the ball

219
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:28,710
form. I wouldn't want to drop the ball
because I'm sure he would be angry. Um,

220
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:33,130
but yeah, it wasn't new.
It wasn't a bad job. Yeah.

221
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,430
I would think if you understand
the value of the job,

222
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,580
really understand the
value of a job, um, you,

223
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,140
you probably will never really feel
emasculated or anything. No. But I think,

224
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:47,980
you know, sometimes some of us
can go into jobs and be like,

225
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:52,810
you know, I'm a, I'm a leader.
I'm not a helper. You know,

226
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:54,580
kind of kind of attitude.
Yeah.

227
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,450
Well it's interesting too because when
you're working for the admiral then when

228
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:02,260
you speak,
you kind of kind of,

229
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,840
you kind of speak for the admiral.
So in other words,

230
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:08,110
when I'd go in to talk to some
senior captains and I said, hey,

231
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,790
can I get a copy of Xyz? Right. They
knew it wasn't me that wanted it.

232
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,610
They knew it was the boss at wanted it.
So people are snapping too.

233
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:18,820
So it was pretty, it was interesting
from that perspective. You know,

234
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:23,290
all I was a young lieutenant at the time,
I'd go in and say, hey can we get this?

235
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,430
We need this report.

236
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,610
And the guys would be like jumping to
like full captains would be jumping too.

237
00:14:27,611 --> 00:14:30,610
Cause they knew that it wasn't for me
and they respected the boss and they

238
00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:33,990
wanted to help him out.
So it was you, do you,

239
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,080
you get a little bit of added
weight because people know,

240
00:14:38,081 --> 00:14:41,500
especially because people kind of knew
we had a good relationship and so they

241
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:44,020
knew that if I was asking for something
or I needed something or I was

242
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:47,050
suggesting something,
they knew where it was coming from.

243
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,700
They knew it was coming
from the big boss man.

244
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,310
So it kind of like like the executive

245
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,920
assistant to like Oprah or something.
Well,

246
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,180
no,
there you go.

247
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,440
We're not going to talk about the verse
and that you just talked about on this

248
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:08,040
podcast is not happening.
Gotcha.

249
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:14,600
Error Error.
I'm just saying,

250
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:16,940
you know, if he'd go around
and you're like, Hey, I need,

251
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:21,260
I would say it would be the equivalent
of being the executive assistant to a

252
00:15:21,261 --> 00:15:24,380
very powerful CEO that has a lot of,

253
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,040
that has a lot of stress and decisions
to make and has a large global

254
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:36,120
corporation. Yeah. In there
under their command actually in.

255
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,320
That kind of reminds me of the
whole flying first class thing.

256
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:42,560
And I thought about this where there was
a big part of me that thought, Oh yeah,

257
00:15:42,561 --> 00:15:46,220
a lot of guys they'll just fly first class
just cause that's like a status thing

258
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:50,120
and like, Oh yeah, I'm this high. So
I get to kind of live in this luxury.

259
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:55,390
But flying first class eliminates
a lot of stress and a lot of um,

260
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,790
like decision making and headaches,
you know,

261
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,380
we're contending with certain things.

262
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:05,570
So when you arrive you have way less
on your mind. So, and that, that,

263
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,710
that's a lot you ever had.

264
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,440
You ever had to do something or
convey something important message,

265
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:11,600
but you have a lot on your mind
to some other stuff. It's a,

266
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:16,220
it makes it way harder than I just
prioritize and execute. No, right. I know,

267
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:21,020
but every day it has its function.
That's what I'm saying. It does. It does.

268
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,080
And there was the time that the literally
the one time we were authorized and

269
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,270
executed a first class travel was
when we flew to Europe and the,

270
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,550
when we arrived at six
o'clock in the morning,

271
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,710
the boss or seven o'clock in the morning,

272
00:16:36,711 --> 00:16:41,510
the boss was talking to the troops a
half an hour later and then the whole day

273
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:44,690
was scheduled out talking to
the local senior leadership.

274
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,460
So he needed to be arrested
when he showed up there. Yeah.

275
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,620
Now me on the other hand, if I remember
correctly, I was in the cheap seats,

276
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,810
but you don't really need that much for
us as a young lieutenant can just suck

277
00:16:56,811 --> 00:16:59,090
it up cause it was pretty pathetic.

278
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:01,520
We're sitting here talking about
FirstClass do we? Oh, you know what?

279
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,850
Let's just talk about Bob Hoffman. Do
you know what I mean? World War One.

280
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,480
Trench warfare. Yeah. He don't think he
used to worried about flying first class.

281
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:13,520
We had a lot of decisions to me. Yeah.
So let's just suck it up. Suck it up.

282
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,950
All right. That's a question Jocko. Do
you have a suggestion for a martial art?

283
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:22,400
For a wheelchair user?
I'm considering FMA,

284
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,040
Filipino martial arts or Krav Maga.

285
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,790
I want exercise and self defense.

286
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,960
Well again,
this is as usual,

287
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:40,961
my first suggestion for true self defense,

288
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,560
to protect yourself from the
world and the evils of the world.

289
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,033
Concealed carry,

290
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,500
you know, get a weapon, learn how to shoot
a weapon, spend time at the range, train,

291
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:59,310
train with it is a more shooting a weapon
as a martial art carrying a weapon as

292
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,144
a martial art,

293
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,460
knowing how to use that weapon in
various situations. It is a martial art.

294
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:10,461
So shooting is a martial art and so
that's the most effective martial art to

295
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:15,510
know and to have the possession of is

296
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,760
concealed carry carry
weapons. So the, again,

297
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:24,900
I'm not saying that just because
this individuals in a wheelchair,

298
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,800
because I mean obviously being in a
wheelchair does put you at a disadvantage,

299
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,290
but it doesn't matter.
Wheelchair or not.

300
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,100
There's always going to be somebody
that's bigger and badder than you.

301
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,710
And if there's not somebody
that's bigger and badder than you,

302
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,040
then there's three or four people combined
together that make a person that's

303
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:51,510
better than you. That's called a
game. And I will tell you right now,

304
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:58,040
any three people in the world can beat
anyone in the world in a fight like three

305
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:01,810
on one, you're going to lose. Oh,

306
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,780
now can you get a guy that put knock
somebody that somebody out turns around?

307
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,300
Lack of,
I mean it does happen,

308
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:11,750
but if the people that are attacking no
anything view have a really bad chance,

309
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,570
really bad chance of winning. It's
very tough to win a fight three on one.

310
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:21,180
So trained with firearms, get
a gun. And you know, also,

311
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:24,270
and you mentioned the Filipino
martial arts and, and I,

312
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,100
I sometimes fail to mention this,
uh, to carry a knife. But yeah,

313
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,950
you should absolutely have a knife.
You should know how to use it.

314
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,460
So that is your Filipino martial arts
generally learning to use a knife and

315
00:19:38,671 --> 00:19:43,290
carry a knife. And then what do I,
what am I going to do after that?

316
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,350
I'm going to do the same thing. I
always talk about Jujitsu, boxing,

317
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:51,120
wrestling in boy tie, kind of in
that order. Now do Jitsu. Boxing,

318
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,090
wrestling, Moy, Tai, we started
with Jujitsu. We move on to boxing.

319
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:57,930
We learn wrestling and learn more
tie. Sometimes Moy, Tai and resting.

320
00:19:57,931 --> 00:20:00,660
You can flip back and forth which one
you want to focus on, but, but the,

321
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,220
the deal is with all three of those,

322
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:06,000
you have to adapt them to
the situation that you're in.

323
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,450
Whatever that situation is.
Now, if you're in a wheelchair,

324
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,710
I don't know what this is
going to look like for you.

325
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,010
I don't know what that looks like.
You got to learn it.

326
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,860
You've got to understand it. You've got,
and then you've got to make things work.

327
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:18,240
You've got to figure it out.
You've got to test it.

328
00:20:18,241 --> 00:20:21,990
You've got to see what's effective and
you've got to see what isn't effective.

329
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,600
And you have to adapt. You have
to adapt. And I've trained with

330
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:34,100
all kinds of different people that
have their own obstacles to overcome.

331
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,573
Um,

332
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:41,550
I've trained with guys that have
amputees missing one leg, two legs,

333
00:20:41,551 --> 00:20:44,790
missing arms.
I've trained with people that are blind.

334
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,830
I've trained with people that are,

335
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,400
I've trained with people
with traumatic brain injuries

336
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,930
and they all work and
try and figure it away.

337
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,220
And they do figure ways to adapt. I mean,
you got guys like, uh, Kyle Maynard,

338
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:02,054
do you know who that is?

339
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,560
He's got no arms and no legs and he
trains Jiu Jitsu and he wrestled and he

340
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:12,310
wrestled in high school. Like he competed
and he, he's competed in Jujitsu.

341
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:16,270
He's actually competed in the MMA
as well, which is, which is crazy.

342
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,820
Uh, but you know what, he adapts
to the situation that he's in.

343
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,680
Um, man, there's um, Anthony Robles,

344
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:33,180
he's a NC Day Ncaa hundred and
25 pound champion champion.

345
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,820
And by the way, he has
one leg. I mean, one leg,

346
00:21:39,821 --> 00:21:44,821
his other leg has gone like from the
hip down one leg and he won the Ncaa

347
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:52,330
Championship. That's incredible. Um,
and he just adapted when you guys,

348
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:57,250
Jacques Machado, he's got one
hand, Jeffrey Al Jeffrey, al.

349
00:21:57,251 --> 00:22:01,630
He's trains with us. He's got
one hand, his other hand's gone.

350
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,810
He was born with no hand. Oh, guess what?

351
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,140
Now all all you Jujitsu players out there
that you think about when you're doing

352
00:22:08,141 --> 00:22:11,500
Jujitsu with the ghee and think of how
much you grab when you're trading with

353
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:14,710
Jeff. You don't even know that he doesn't
have a hand. You just don't even know.

354
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:18,250
He just does other stuff. He's
adapted to it. As a matter of fact,

355
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:23,230
he uses that stump to choke you and attack
you. It gets in there. Yeah, he, he,

356
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,260
he sneaks that thing in there.
Um,

357
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:31,780
what about Max Maximilian?
Yeah. Yeah. Max Wright. Max.

358
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,440
He's, if he's paralyzed,
but, and that's recent too.

359
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,910
So he got paralyzed. What, three years?
Five, four years ago, five years ago,

360
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:44,210
something like that. He was like
maybe a white belt, maybe a blue belt.

361
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,590
He's a blue belt, I think is performed
now. Yeah, I think he's a purple now.

362
00:22:47,591 --> 00:22:51,130
But I mean, he's got basically,
I think it's about sternum down.

363
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,140
He's completely paralyzed,
sternum down. And he,

364
00:22:54,141 --> 00:22:58,190
so he's figured out he actually
has to move his legs. You know,

365
00:22:58,191 --> 00:22:59,950
like when he's,
when you're rolling with him,

366
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:04,240
he's got to grab his legs and move them
into different positions, which is, uh,

367
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,980
which is crazy,
but he's still training.

368
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,770
He's advancing in his and
he's learning to adapt.

369
00:23:08,771 --> 00:23:12,310
He though he knows how to choke
you. He, he's figured things out.

370
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:17,110
So whether you're short or tall,

371
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:21,790
big or small, older, young, stronger
week, wheelchair, no wheelchair,

372
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:25,150
leg, no leg, learn it,

373
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,280
learn it all and start with
you did to learn some maxing,

374
00:23:30,281 --> 00:23:33,490
some boy tie than wrestling.
And then once you get that base built up,

375
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,650
start looking at Krav Maga.
I started looking at Cali
so you can learn, you know,

376
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,550
if you want to learn weapons and
obviously from the beginning, um,

377
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,180
that the firearm trumps everything.
Yeah.

378
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,890
Yeah. Especially when
you're training with, um,

379
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,940
like any kind of disadvantage or whatever.

380
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:56,280
I think it's important to understand what
your potential goal will be in a self

381
00:23:56,281 --> 00:23:59,610
defense situation. So if you're, you know,

382
00:23:59,611 --> 00:24:01,860
like if you don't have
legs like Max for example,

383
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:06,890
like you can learn a lot of
stuff that is just defensive.

384
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,970
And if you know Jujitsu, and I sound
like a Jujitsu advocate, which I am,

385
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,670
but if you learn Jujitsu,
you'll learn how to be defensive,

386
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:22,290
how you can shut down another guy's
attacks. And he's so like I said,

387
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:25,080
like if your adventure,
like you're disadvantaged is pretty big,

388
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:30,140
just understand what your goals will be
in a potential self defense situation.

389
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,190
You know? So you're not
going to be like, okay,

390
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,400
I'm going to learn these martial arts
so I can kick as much as I possibly can.

391
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:42,760
That's the point. The point of
this is that you have to adapt.

392
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,010
You have to adapt. You have to say, okay,

393
00:24:45,011 --> 00:24:47,140
this is one of maybe what we'll do
and this is, I can't do that move,

394
00:24:47,141 --> 00:24:50,380
but I can do this move. Right. And by the
way, you can't do this, but I can do that.

395
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:53,730
Yes. And you don't like, like we were
just talking about Jeffrey Jeffrey.

396
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:58,000
I was a guy trained with most regularly
out of the out of these folks and he has

397
00:24:58,001 --> 00:25:00,340
adapted and does things that you,

398
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:04,480
that is totally unique to
him and he makes it an event.

399
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,810
He takes a disadvantage, turns it
into an advantage, you know? Yeah.

400
00:25:07,811 --> 00:25:11,880
There's an MMA guy who, who was the champ
and one of these shows I for, I forget,

401
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:15,910
it might've been Bella tour maybe,
I don't know. I forget, but he, uh,

402
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:20,020
he had one hand too, and he was
the champ though. And I think one,

403
00:25:20,021 --> 00:25:23,710
how do I not know who that is? I
forget his name too, but it was while,

404
00:25:23,711 --> 00:25:26,110
it was like maybe a year ago or
something or more a while ago,

405
00:25:26,111 --> 00:25:30,600
a year and [inaudible] has been around
for 20 plus years in America. You know,

406
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:35,140
the current champ is always
seems so new. Yeah. That's, uh,

407
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,130
that's awesome. That's, that
is definitely a outstanding,

408
00:25:39,131 --> 00:25:43,840
to see people overcome that and
in what you can do.

409
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,930
You just got to have that, that, that

410
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:53,950
the creative mind to get in there
and adapt to the situation. Yeah.

411
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:59,500
And it goes along with kind of
what I think it was. I forget who,

412
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:03,960
but um, how they say, you know, a little
exercise is better than no exercise,

413
00:26:03,961 --> 00:26:05,420
you know?
So sometimes like if you,

414
00:26:05,421 --> 00:26:08,790
if you find yourself in a wheelchair or
something like this, where he'll be like,

415
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:12,960
oh yeah, that's not for me. But
this obviously is for him, you know?

416
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:16,620
So get out there and like, are you saying
like learn something or learn it all,

417
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:20,150
whatever. That's better than not
knowing nothing. Yep. Way Better too.

418
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:24,890
Especially if it's
good.

419
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,820
Get after it. That's it.
Next question. Jocko.

420
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:33,560
Mr Jocko,
whenever I get mentally overwhelmed,

421
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:36,560
I shut down completely.
How do I counter that?

422
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:42,680
Well, the first thing and the first good
step that you've already made as you've

423
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:44,220
identified this as an issue,

424
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,320
you recognize the fact that you shut down.

425
00:26:46,321 --> 00:26:49,260
That's step number one in solving your
problem is identifying your problem.

426
00:26:49,261 --> 00:26:52,920
So excellent work there. The next
step is actually pretty easy as well.

427
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:55,050
You've identified the
fact that you shut down.

428
00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:00,210
The next step that you're going to do is
not shut down, not mentally shut down.

429
00:27:00,211 --> 00:27:01,110
That's what you want to do.

430
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:05,010
If you start to shut down and you
feel yourself freezing up and say,

431
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:08,670
I'm not going to shut down right now,
I'm going to attack this issue. Now,

432
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
the reason that you're getting overwhelmed
most likely is because there's a lot

433
00:27:14,431 --> 00:27:18,270
of different things flying at you at the
same time and they're all happening at

434
00:27:18,271 --> 00:27:21,840
once and it's problematic for you.
We have a very simple solution for that.

435
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:23,100
It's prioritize and execute.

436
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,680
So what is the biggest problem
that you've got going on?

437
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,690
Let's identify what
that biggest problem is.

438
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,790
Then let's attack that problem and get
it solved. Once we got that one solved,

439
00:27:30,791 --> 00:27:33,240
we can move on to the next one.
Once we get to take care of that one,

440
00:27:33,241 --> 00:27:36,330
we can move on to next. When we
go right on down the line, that's,

441
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,590
that's what we do.
That's very simple.

442
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:44,130
You know that you're going to
get overwhelmed. First of all,

443
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:45,720
tell yourself you're not
going to go overwhelmed.

444
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:49,140
Then you've actually don't
get overwhelmed, and how
do you not get overwhelmed?

445
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,400
You prioritize and execute.

446
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,110
If you start feeling
yourself getting overwhelmed,

447
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:01,110
do what I did to the platoon commander
that I had that was getting all freaked

448
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:05,190
out during, during um, the Humvee.

449
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,740
I address immediate action drills where
you're patrolling through the desert and

450
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:14,010
we have little electrical targets
at pop up and then you are,

451
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:18,990
everyone starts shooting at the targets
and this guy was locking up and not

452
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:20,760
making any decisions even
though he used to leader.

453
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,530
And this is the one where I took a magic
marker and I wrote with a sharpie right

454
00:28:25,531 --> 00:28:29,970
in front of his face on the Humvee window.
I said, next time the shooting starts,

455
00:28:29,971 --> 00:28:34,650
here's what I want you would want you
to, number one, relax. Number two,

456
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:39,180
look around. Number three, make a call.
It's really easy. So step number one,

457
00:28:39,181 --> 00:28:43,860
when you're getting overwhelmed,
relax, relax, breathe.

458
00:28:43,861 --> 00:28:46,740
Take a step back.
Just take a step back.

459
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:51,630
The red flags start going off in your
head and you're realizing that you're

460
00:28:51,631 --> 00:28:55,890
getting overwhelmed and you're going to
get shut down. No, just take a step back.

461
00:28:55,891 --> 00:28:56,724
Relax.

462
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,033
Okay.

463
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:05,340
And then prioritize and execute.
Pretty simple call. Yeah.

464
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:08,250
Yeah, it's good. Simple.

465
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,320
Next question.
Let's do it.

466
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,270
What technique do you use to not
lose your temper with your wife? Oh,

467
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,130
when you know she's wrong and refuses
to budge. Well, this is kind of, uh,

468
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:26,850
this question is actually moot
because my wife is never wrong.

469
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:34,500
So, so number one, losing your
temper, losing your temper is

470
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,690
weak. It's actually a week. It's
actually a week to lose your temper.

471
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:42,100
It actually is a loss control

472
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,010
when you lose your temper. And,
and losing control is also weak.

473
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:53,530
So we don't, we don't want to lose our
temper. That's, that's one of our goals.

474
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,900
So again,
just like prioritize and execute.

475
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,080
What do you do when you start feeling
yourself losing your temper? Stop.

476
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:02,350
Take a step back,
detach from it brief.

477
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:07,180
And then you got to think
about the long term victory.

478
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,870
And we've talked about this before.
We've talked about this before.

479
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:16,050
Proving that your right to your wife is
not necessarily the best gold to have.

480
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,310
What you want to do is you want to,

481
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:26,620
you want to win the war.
Not that one battle.

482
00:30:26,621 --> 00:30:29,710
The one battle doesn't even matter.
I mean,

483
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,800
what is this stupid
argument about anyways?

484
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,560
It's not about something that matters.
It isn't.

485
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,080
I can almost guarantee it's not
about something that matters.

486
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:43,620
It's about some random thing that
doesn't matter in the big picture at all.

487
00:30:44,171 --> 00:30:46,660
So why are you getting upset about it?

488
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,980
Why are you losing control? Why are you
losing your temper? You can't do that.

489
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,140
You can't do that.

490
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:58,900
So when you feel like you're coming
up against the, this is some zoo,

491
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:01,390
you know you're going against
a heavily defended position,

492
00:31:01,391 --> 00:31:03,310
don't attack the heavily
defended position.

493
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,430
If your wife is not
admitting that she's wrong,

494
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,050
she's refusing to budge what have you,

495
00:31:08,051 --> 00:31:09,520
what are you doing and
what you're attacking her.

496
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,370
You're actually attacking a
heavily defended position.

497
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:17,350
Some sue told you not to do that 2,500
years ago and it holds true to this day.

498
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,860
So what are you going to do when they're,
when they're not budging,

499
00:31:20,861 --> 00:31:23,950
you're going to flank up.
You're going to flank them,

500
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,290
your new blue move around to the outside
and come in from another angle that

501
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:32,860
they weren't expecting.
You know,

502
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,470
maybe that other angle looks like flowers.

503
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,920
Maybe the other angle looks like dinner,
maybe it looks like,

504
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,040
maybe just looks like changing the
subject to something that they can be more

505
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:48,580
flexible mentally on.
Because

506
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,890
if you,
if you go against that hardened position,

507
00:31:53,891 --> 00:31:56,080
I can almost guarantee
you it's not going to,

508
00:31:56,110 --> 00:32:00,670
they're not going to budge on it in all
your w what you're going to do to try

509
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:04,030
and get them to budge is you're
going to escalate yourself. Oh,

510
00:32:04,031 --> 00:32:06,280
you're not budging. They hit it
harder. Oh, you're still not budging.

511
00:32:06,281 --> 00:32:07,091
I'm going to go even harder.

512
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,820
You're still not budging and going
to be harder there that whole time.

513
00:32:09,821 --> 00:32:12,370
Every time you're going harder. They're
digging the defenses in deeper, deeper,

514
00:32:12,371 --> 00:32:15,640
deeper,
and they're remembering how,

515
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,440
how mean you are or whatever.
Especially if you're in a,

516
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:22,210
in a loss of 10 per situation.
Oh yeah. Now you're,

517
00:32:22,211 --> 00:32:27,211
now you're taking serious detriment to
your longterm war because you've now

518
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:31,600
you've given them ammunition. You've
given them ammunition for future use,

519
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:34,600
bad move. It's a bad move. Uh, so

520
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,990
again,
what isn't what the F

521
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,620
who's right and who's wrong
is just not important.

522
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,870
It's so hard to get through people's head.

523
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:49,520
Who's right and who's wrong on some little
tactical babble battle of today that

524
00:32:49,521 --> 00:32:51,440
really has no bearing on
anything in the world.

525
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:54,630
This is not something to
be concerned about. Yup.

526
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:59,420
So it might be your own
ego that wants to be right.

527
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:04,340
Have we thought about that factor? Have
we thought about that? You as a man,

528
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,910
as a husband,
you want to be right too.

529
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,890
So guess who the person that isn't budge,

530
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,600
guess who the person they've done
isn't budging us. It's you. It's you.

531
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:19,310
Now you might be quote unquote,
right? But it doesn't matter.

532
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:22,760
You're the person that won't budge.
Now neither one of you will budge.

533
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:25,820
Neither one are you have budge.
We're not in a good situation.

534
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:31,090
We're just in an escalating
war of destruction and we
don't want that because we

535
00:33:32,421 --> 00:33:36,230
want to win the long term strategic war.
That's what we're looking at.

536
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,340
Just the longterm strategic wore
the little stuff in between.

537
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,910
We just not concerned about. Yeah. Yeah.

538
00:33:43,911 --> 00:33:47,190
Fully in the whole not budging thing too,

539
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,150
like that hurts a nice
to think about this.

540
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:53,240
Early on in my relationship
where I would get,

541
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:56,020
we'd get in little arguments or whatever,
um,

542
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:01,160
varying levels and
sometimes she would like,

543
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,330
can you even come up with an example
of something you'd argue about?

544
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,310
Because as I was trying to
think as I was sitting here,

545
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:09,540
as I was answering this question,
I was trying to think of a good exam.

546
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:14,090
I can't even think of a good example.
Yeah. Because they're all so stupid.

547
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:19,610
Yeah. So, yeah. A good example.
No, that's hard. Not really. Um,

548
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:26,210
but so she would be like, oh, I just
don't want to talk about it anymore.

549
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:30,530
But meanwhile I'm still salty.
Like, Hey, we didn't resolve this.

550
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,470
You know,
there's certain code words,

551
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:39,350
like a safe word that girls, that women
that guys have it too. But in particular,

552
00:34:39,351 --> 00:34:43,400
I've noticed it with some of my friends'
wives and, um, one of my wife's,

553
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,680
she'll say, doesn't, it doesn't matter.

554
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:50,840
What do you mean buzzword like a code
note pizza. It's a, it's a red flag.

555
00:34:50,841 --> 00:34:53,090
So I'll give an example.
She, it'll just be a,

556
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,190
it'll be a giant red flag that she's,
that she's angry. She doesn't jog.

557
00:34:58,191 --> 00:34:59,870
Nothing I say is going to matter anymore.

558
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:03,170
She's not going to change your mind
and she's just going to go forward and

559
00:35:03,171 --> 00:35:07,220
she'll be like, oh, it doesn't matter.
I'm like, oh, okay. We all morning,

560
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:11,180
Eh big H is angry.
That's what it means.

561
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,840
So when I hear her say it doesn't
matter, I just realized, okay, I'm now,

562
00:35:14,841 --> 00:35:16,520
I just hit it, uh, uh,

563
00:35:16,521 --> 00:35:21,440
heavily defended position and I'm going
to stop attacking it. I'm going to flank,

564
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,480
I'm going to talk about something else.
I'm coming in from the side hatch.

565
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,790
That's what I'm going
to do. Yeah. Yeah Man,

566
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:33,200
I wish I would've known that long
time ago. I think that when w wait,

567
00:35:33,201 --> 00:35:34,940
what did you just say that
your wife said to you?

568
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:39,030
Cause you just said a code word. I
mean, uh, I don't want to talk about it.

569
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,620
I don't want, there you go.
That's another one. Yeah.

570
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:44,190
I want to talk about the sets that too,
that's a red flag in my mind. It was like,

571
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:48,680
Yay, let's talk about it. I try, I would
try to do it in a conducive way. Like,

572
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,530
you know, like a problem
solving kind of way. But she,

573
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:54,720
she just didn't feel the same way
about the whole situation. You know,

574
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:57,150
she handles it different.
And you know,

575
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,840
ultimately I still feel like if two
people are willing to talk it out kind of

576
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:04,470
without too much emotion, I think
that's, that's an effective way to do it.

577
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,390
But nonetheless,
what this would cause is,

578
00:36:06,391 --> 00:36:08,520
and this is going back
to people not budget,

579
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:14,090
so what that would cause is all this time
that would go on that were not on good

580
00:36:14,161 --> 00:36:16,140
terms. You know, because
I want to talk about it.

581
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:18,750
She doesn't want to talk about it. She
just wants to, I don't know, go to bed,

582
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,260
you know. Meanwhile I am
with the philosophy of don't
go to bed in an argument or

583
00:36:22,261 --> 00:36:26,250
whatever, you know, but meanwhile
we're at odds even just a little bit.

584
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:29,580
Even if we don't talk about it, she
forgets about it. I'm still at odds.

585
00:36:29,581 --> 00:36:34,380
I'm not budging with my philosophy,
you know? So at the end of the day,

586
00:36:34,381 --> 00:36:37,260
when you look back at all the minutes,
all the hours,

587
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:42,261
all the days that you
spent with each other,

588
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,710
and now you have that, that, that some of,

589
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:50,790
of moments that you're at odds, you look
in your relationship, you're like, man,

590
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:54,450
this relationship isn't that good because
he spent that much time at odds with

591
00:36:54,451 --> 00:36:58,530
each other just because you
didn't want to budge. Yes.

592
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:02,520
So you've got to budge. You
got a buddy, one of my buddies,

593
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,510
I was hanging around with
him and his wife and uh, her,

594
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:09,570
her little buzzword where I was like,
Ooh, I picked up on it pretty quickly.

595
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:14,910
She would say, that's fine.
And I was like, and at first,

596
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:16,770
you know, first couple times I
was like, oh, it's fine with her.

597
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,920
And then I realize it does not mean that's
fine. I think that's kind of common.

598
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,530
A common knowledge one though would
worlds like you can look that up.

599
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:30,390
I think that's fine. Fine, whatever.
Whatever's offensive though.

600
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,380
Oh yeah. And then they know if
they say whatever then that,

601
00:37:33,381 --> 00:37:37,080
that means that's fighting words.
If you'll notice, that's fine.

602
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:41,220
And it doesn't matter.
They are all, they're all

603
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:47,850
like sort of passive way of saying
like, oh, let's just move on.

604
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:52,860
Yeah. I don't want to talk about it. That
one's a borderline. Yeah. Or it's like,

605
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:56,670
it's like one of the,
so what's good is when you're,

606
00:37:56,671 --> 00:37:58,240
when you detach from the situation,

607
00:37:58,241 --> 00:38:01,770
she start to pick up on these
things that your significant other.

608
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,440
And also there's, when you're
in a relationship, you're in,

609
00:38:04,441 --> 00:38:07,200
it's team building and Vara team
environment, or you're in a business,

610
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:11,520
you start to realize that guys or people
you work with will have this same thing

611
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:16,200
where they'll say, you know
what? It's your call. Okay.

612
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:21,030
I know it's my call, but I'm not trying
to impose this plan on you. Let's,

613
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,220
let's figure it out. No, it's
your call. We'll go ahead. Yeah.

614
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,960
So that means you clearly
don't agree with it.

615
00:38:24,961 --> 00:38:27,300
Of course you can't say this to them
because they're already dug in on the fact

616
00:38:27,301 --> 00:38:29,040
that you're right.
You know that you're wrong.

617
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:34,340
So those are little red flags you gotta
look out for in the world. Yeah. So

618
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,610
that's fine. And he didn't that that's
a complex thing because you know,

619
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:44,080
when someone says, fine,
you know what's wrong,

620
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,020
what's wrong? Nothing,
right? Oh, you know,

621
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:50,110
or you have reason to
believe that it's not fine,

622
00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:52,090
especially the fine or that's fine.

623
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,420
You have good reason to believe
that it's not fine. Right?

624
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:58,480
So in your mind it's logical to think,
hey,

625
00:38:58,481 --> 00:39:02,170
you shouldn't say you're
fine when you're not fine.

626
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,940
You actively chose to say you're
fine when you're not fine factually.

627
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:11,830
So it's easy to come to
that logical conclusion, but
there's your problem, right?

628
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:15,160
Logical solution. I know. It's
just, it's not that simple.

629
00:39:15,161 --> 00:39:16,720
It's not that black and white.
So,

630
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:21,750
and I'm saying this because I kind of
up until really recently I thought that,

631
00:39:22,781 --> 00:39:24,820
hey look,
I'm not really wrong with this thing.

632
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:29,030
I asked you a very specific question.
If you're saying you're fine, it's,

633
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:33,550
it's like it doesn't even matter what
you say. I have to read like your,

634
00:39:33,551 --> 00:39:34,460
your mind or your,

635
00:39:34,461 --> 00:39:39,160
your body language and everything
you know and disregard your words.

636
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,870
And only under these circumstances,
not when you, when I say, Hey,

637
00:39:43,871 --> 00:39:48,730
do you need, I don't know, milk from
the store. You say, no, I know you mean,

638
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:51,580
yeah, you know, it doesn't work like
that. It's only under this circumstance.

639
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,540
So it's like, Hey, I'm thinking, Hey man,
that's kind of, that's not very good.

640
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:58,930
That's, that's a bad thing in habit
to get in. So if you're not fine,

641
00:39:58,931 --> 00:40:01,150
you should say you're not.
That's my logic is what I'm saying.

642
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,073
But here's the thing,

643
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:05,680
when you're in a relationship with someone
and it start to understand and starts

644
00:40:05,681 --> 00:40:07,750
at the beginning where you're
trying to figure all this stuff out,

645
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,400
that's what the beginning
of the relationship before.

646
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,550
But after a while you start to
know, okay, I know that tone.

647
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,380
I know when you say fine,
it's not,

648
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:19,630
the thing that's jacked up is when people
don't realize that what that the dead

649
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,710
as a code word, that means
something else. Right, right.

650
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,340
Signifying is you are coming up
against a heavily defended area.

651
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,960
I'm not changing my mind, but I'm not
going to sit here and argue about it. So,

652
00:40:31,961 --> 00:40:35,920
you know what doesn't matter is what my
wife would say. Oh, it doesn't matter.

653
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:41,230
Man wouldn't matters when, when Sarah
would say, I don't want to argue,

654
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:45,280
I don't want to argue about this.
It's fine. Let's not talk about it.

655
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,050
That would enrage me for further.

656
00:40:47,051 --> 00:40:51,400
Not like I'm not a lose temper kind of
whatever, but um, we re frustrates you.

657
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:54,380
It wouldn't make me will be like, no,
we have to go to, it's like, you know,

658
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:58,390
if you have like fucking like a,
like a splinter,

659
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:02,850
like if you have a splinter in your
hand or something not talking about it,

660
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:07,240
it's like I just leave it, let the
skin grow over it and you'll be fine.

661
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,620
And the thing is,
you probably will be fine.

662
00:41:08,621 --> 00:41:11,830
But he's still got that splinter in there.
Me. I'm like, okay, let's talk about,

663
00:41:11,831 --> 00:41:14,380
let's open it up and get the splinter out.

664
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,830
But she's like, no, you know,

665
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,460
ripping that splinter out. Yeah. And
I know that sometimes the, again,

666
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:28,930
you're going up against a
hardened defensive area and
that's what we're talking

667
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:30,760
about here. That's what the
question is. The question is,

668
00:41:30,761 --> 00:41:34,970
how do you not lose your temper with your
wife when you know she's wrong and she

669
00:41:34,971 --> 00:41:37,400
refused to budge.
You know how you now you don't do it.

670
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:40,040
You know how you maintain your temper,
you realize that you're in a,

671
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:45,430
you're in a strategic situation where
you're just gonna win strategically.

672
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,620
You can to outsmart,
you're going to help maneuver.

673
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:52,970
You're going to out manipulate, I'm
sorry. You can manipulate the situation.

674
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:56,660
That's what you're going to do.
And you're going to make her think,

675
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,040
you know what man,

676
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:02,490
I was kind of a chair class night
to my wonderful husband. Yeah,

677
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:07,520
yeah. That's what we ought to have. Yeah.
You got to do it in this genuine way.

678
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:11,960
You know, like you're so you gotta be
genuine, real genuine and open and warm.

679
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:16,280
No one wants to attack you when
you're in that state, you know?

680
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:21,290
So that's what you do. Me,
my wife, no rug telling you.

681
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:25,130
Maybe if you switch all of a sudden
and she's like, hey, this is the trick.

682
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:29,530
But if you're like, if you put it
on here, just disarming them. Yes,

683
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:32,870
exactly. You disarm him. But man, it's
hard to do when you lose your temper.

684
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,730
I answered a question the other day.

685
00:42:34,731 --> 00:42:37,970
I was at an event and I answered
her question. I was like, listen,

686
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,340
do not take marriage advice from me

687
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:46,310
cause the question, it's a long story.
But the question was about, you know,

688
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:51,940
how do you do your job when you have all
this pressure and how do you maintain

689
00:42:52,191 --> 00:42:54,890
your family? And I kind of went through
the story of like, Hey, you know,

690
00:42:54,891 --> 00:42:59,330
my family came second and that's
really hard for people to understand.

691
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:02,180
And I went through the whole thing and
I had got to the end and I said, listen,

692
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:07,190
don't take marriage advice for me.
And everyone kind of laughed. But uh,

693
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:12,840
but in a situation like this to actually
take marriage advice roommate, yeah.

694
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:16,940
Don't attack defended positions. I've
said that 47 times right now. Yeah.

695
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:20,900
And it's not to say that you've
never attacked, defended.

696
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:23,360
I don't know if you ever
have it with your wife,

697
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:27,110
but I'm just saying that sounds
like good objective advice.

698
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,960
I probably haven't done that.

699
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:34,860
And so long it's like it's like one are
we going to ask on the podcast when we

700
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,900
got asked us on the podcast,

701
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:40,730
when is the last time that you were dug
in on a on a position and how did you

702
00:43:40,731 --> 00:43:42,350
admit that you are wrong?
And I was like, Oh man,

703
00:43:42,351 --> 00:43:46,010
I haven't been dug in on a position
and years. I don't even remember. Yeah,

704
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:50,330
so it's the same thing here. What do I
attack my wife in a defended position?

705
00:43:50,331 --> 00:43:53,480
Something that she's super crazy and
passionate about and I'm not going near

706
00:43:53,481 --> 00:43:58,450
that thing. Yeah. Yeah. The losing
your temper thing too, and I learned,

707
00:43:58,460 --> 00:43:59,780
and I mentioned this before,

708
00:43:59,781 --> 00:44:04,430
where I'd learned about just getting mad
in general from this book called Mind

709
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:05,900
Games.
He was teeny tiny little book.

710
00:44:05,901 --> 00:44:10,220
One chapter was not even one page and
get your first review on the podcast.

711
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:14,720
You can be the reviewer, we can mine.
Some of them were like puzzles, you know,

712
00:44:14,721 --> 00:44:17,070
to see how your mind works anyway,
but it,

713
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,990
what it did was indicate
this as Plinko involved.

714
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,100
That's the price is right.
Anyway,

715
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:30,140
what it indicated was that losing
your temper or having anger issues,

716
00:44:30,141 --> 00:44:34,620
anger management is was it will,
it was a result of low self esteem.

717
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:38,760
So those words. Exactly right. And
that's how I always felt when we,

718
00:44:38,761 --> 00:44:40,350
you know in like elementary school,

719
00:44:40,351 --> 00:44:43,500
intermediate school when they talk about
self esteem and whatever and so low

720
00:44:43,501 --> 00:44:44,500
self esteem,
high self,

721
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,310
I'll be like man that's so
embarrassing to have low self esteem.

722
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:49,050
It was like a almost like a pride thing,

723
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:53,710
you know where I would even if I really
felt like doing something or whatever, I,

724
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:58,470
if it indicated overtly that I had a low
self esteem, if I did I wouldn't do it.

725
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:01,920
It was like really it made you think
that paranoia was caused by a low self

726
00:45:01,921 --> 00:45:05,550
esteem in a way are probably
good. So it's like the, you know,

727
00:45:05,551 --> 00:45:06,930
this would be all switcheroo there.

728
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:12,820
So now I took that like times to where
it said look everyone gets angry.

729
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:17,190
It's a natural part of life.
But if you have anger management issues,

730
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:22,170
it is most likely from as low self esteem.
So I took that as if I ever get angry.

731
00:45:22,171 --> 00:45:23,040
That's a low self esteem.

732
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,850
So Matt and that would be on my mind
every single time where anytime I felt

733
00:45:26,851 --> 00:45:29,640
myself getting mad I'd be like, nope, I
don't have low self esteem. So what that,

734
00:45:29,641 --> 00:45:33,840
did those train me never to lose my
temper. I said if I felt like no,

735
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:37,240
I think I was always laid
back Paul. But, but anyways,

736
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,860
I think that's kind of a thing
to check though. You know,

737
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,550
we're losing your temper
was like, man, what's up?

738
00:45:44,551 --> 00:45:47,190
What's up with you for shooting your
temporary? Don't lose your temper,

739
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:50,430
that's for sure.
Hey,

740
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:54,410
you know that splinter analogy again?
Oh man, Bro, I'm telling you the case.

741
00:45:54,411 --> 00:45:58,200
So this one time, and it wasn't me, it
was jade, he had a splinter where young,

742
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:02,100
he had a splitter in his hand. We
were like young, young, like five.

743
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,720
I know this because we're living in this
specific house that I remember anyway

744
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:10,590
to tell us about that. Anyway, he
had a splinter and it was deep. So,

745
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,720
um, my mom was like,
hey, we gotta get it out.

746
00:46:12,721 --> 00:46:16,290
We got to use like a tweezers or
something. It's like no, no, no.

747
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:20,250
I need to put up this full on. What
do you call it? Like a pardon defense.

748
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,700
We're not getting that splinter
out cause he's crying. He's scared.

749
00:46:23,701 --> 00:46:26,280
You know all this stuff. So my
mom did it all right, you know,

750
00:46:26,281 --> 00:46:28,320
let's don't take out the splitter.
What he did,

751
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:30,330
what she did was wait
for him to go to sleep.

752
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,520
She knew you just take out the splinter.

753
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:35,310
It may or may not hurt for like a
second, but it's out. Who Cares?

754
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:38,880
We waited for him to go
sleep like a little nap.

755
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:43,570
She goes in there gently and just picks
it up. Boom. Problem solved later.

756
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:47,880
Basically Mama Charles flanked him, she
flanked him, totally flanked them. Then

757
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:56,460
props to prompts the moment.
Charles, next question. Yes please.

758
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:01,560
Good Lord. How do you balance
loyalty to your workmates and USP?

759
00:47:01,561 --> 00:47:06,561
Personal sense of honor with self interest
when it comes to career progression.

760
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:11,130
So this question is,
is has,

761
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:16,131
is giving the impression that that being
loyal to your Bros and being loyal to

762
00:47:17,641 --> 00:47:22,641
your workmates and and having pride is
the opposite of of career progression,

763
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:30,220
which is actually,
I understand that is coming from,

764
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:32,680
but it's actually does
not have to be true.

765
00:47:32,681 --> 00:47:36,930
That does not have to be the way you
think that the way you get around this as

766
00:47:36,931 --> 00:47:38,650
number one, you work
hard. That's what you do.

767
00:47:38,651 --> 00:47:43,651
You work hard and you do a
good job not for promotion,

768
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,930
not for self interest,
but to help the team accomplish the goal.

769
00:47:49,931 --> 00:47:51,670
That's what you should
be working hard for.

770
00:47:51,671 --> 00:47:55,870
That's what you should be doing
a good job for. And if you're,

771
00:47:55,871 --> 00:47:58,600
and this is something I've said
a bunch of times over the years,

772
00:47:58,601 --> 00:48:00,490
I don't know if I've ever
said on the podcast before,

773
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:03,790
but I used to tell my
guys because we'd be,

774
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:07,060
we'd be in some long term administrative,

775
00:48:07,061 --> 00:48:10,990
psychological warfare in
our community, in, in the,

776
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:14,770
in the seal teams are in our
organization. And I'd say, look,

777
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,080
if we're doing the right
thing for the right reason,

778
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:22,450
we're going to win in the end. And, and
I totally believe that to be true. Now,

779
00:48:22,451 --> 00:48:23,284
for instance,

780
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,670
I never really cared about
rank or being promoted.

781
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:31,540
Now that being said,

782
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:36,990
I actually did put in an officer package
so that I could become an officer.

783
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,160
Now why did I do that?

784
00:48:39,161 --> 00:48:44,020
I didn't do that out of greed
or out of hunger for power.

785
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:48,490
I did it because I had worked for a prior
enlisted officer and he made our lives

786
00:48:48,491 --> 00:48:51,010
really good cause he was a really good
leader. And I said, you know what?

787
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:56,340
I'd like to make a bunch of the guys that
I know make 16 guys in a seal platoon

788
00:48:56,411 --> 00:49:00,310
make their lives better.
Maybe I can do that. So that,

789
00:49:00,311 --> 00:49:02,890
that's sort of what led me to do it.
I didn't do it out of

790
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,760
out of self interest in greed.

791
00:49:06,761 --> 00:49:10,180
I did it to help my bros right now.

792
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:14,410
Then once I got promoted,
I, once I became an officer,

793
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,370
then I just busted my ass to do
the best job I could. And again,

794
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:22,000
I was never concerned with being promoted.

795
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:25,360
But in order to do a good job,
guess what I did?

796
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,810
I built relationships.
I took some hard jobs,

797
00:49:28,811 --> 00:49:32,890
I followed the rules,
I supported the chain of command.

798
00:49:32,891 --> 00:49:35,560
I told the Party line,
why did I do those things?

799
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:36,980
It wasn't because I was
trying to get promoted,

800
00:49:36,981 --> 00:49:38,230
it's cause I was trying to do a good job.

801
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:43,420
And the more relationships I had and
the more respect I had from the chain of

802
00:49:43,421 --> 00:49:48,220
command, the more power I had to help
my guys. It wasn't about power for me.

803
00:49:48,221 --> 00:49:52,390
It was about power for the good of the
platoon so I could accomplish it. And,

804
00:49:52,391 --> 00:49:54,730
and I knew that.

805
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:57,580
I believed in the broad
mission that we were doing.

806
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:02,530
I knew that good order and discipline
actually makes troops perform better.

807
00:50:02,531 --> 00:50:07,531
I knew that and I knew that
by following the rules,

808
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:14,200
by supporting the chain of command,
I knew that towing the part,

809
00:50:14,201 --> 00:50:18,100
I knew that those things would
build trust in the chain of command.

810
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:24,310
And I knew that building trust and
the chain of command and being viewed

811
00:50:24,311 --> 00:50:29,311
positively from up the chain of command
meant that I would get more support from

812
00:50:29,661 --> 00:50:30,494
the chain of command,

813
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:36,490
which once again would make it easier
for my guys to do their job because I

814
00:50:38,031 --> 00:50:40,480
could get a more gear, I could get
them the assets that they needed.

815
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:45,940
I could actually legitimately protest
if something came down the pipe that I

816
00:50:46,941 --> 00:50:49,820
didn't agree with.
If I didn't have trust in bill,

817
00:50:49,821 --> 00:50:53,900
had built a relationship
with my senior, uh, officers,

818
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,240
how can I go back to him and say, Hey,
I don't think we should be doing this.

819
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:58,640
They don't know me.
They don't trust me.

820
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:01,670
But when you build that trust and
you could have a more open and honest

821
00:51:01,671 --> 00:51:02,504
conversations,

822
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:07,540
which again is only done so that
my platoon can have an easier life.

823
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:11,540
So that they can do their job better
because I believed in the mission.

824
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:18,880
So everything that I was doing that I was
doing to make my platoon have a better

825
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:25,040
go at things,
make my platoon more efficient,

826
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:27,350
make my platoon more
effective on the battlefield,

827
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,680
all those things that I was doing,
I was doing to make that.

828
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:36,800
And Lo and behold, when you're doing those
things, when you're busting your ass,

829
00:51:36,801 --> 00:51:38,810
when you're trying to make
life good for your platoon,

830
00:51:38,811 --> 00:51:42,710
would so that your platoon
can more effectively and
efficiently accomplished its

831
00:51:42,711 --> 00:51:45,560
mission on the battlefield?
Well guess what?

832
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:50,060
Those are aligned with a guy that's
working hard and to supporting chain of

833
00:51:50,061 --> 00:51:54,830
command.
So I would get ranked number one why not?

834
00:51:54,831 --> 00:51:57,530
Because I was trying to get promoted,
not for self interest.

835
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:00,320
It's because I was trying to
do a good job for my boys.

836
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:08,020
So the bottom line is if you care about
doing a good job and the the and you're

837
00:52:12,261 --> 00:52:17,261
doing things that will
help you do a good job.

838
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:21,710
Again, not for promotion and not for
recognition, but to truly do a good job.

839
00:52:21,711 --> 00:52:26,630
The end result is most
likely gonna be positive.

840
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:32,720
Now the caveat to this is does that mean
that you'll be the first person to get

841
00:52:32,721 --> 00:52:34,220
promoted?
No.

842
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:39,200
Does it mean that you are
guaranteed to get promoted? No.

843
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:44,450
Some other guy that brown nose and took
all the credit he didn't deserve and

844
00:52:44,451 --> 00:52:47,870
stepped on a people as
backs to get to the top.

845
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:52,400
He's probably going to get promoted ahead
of you and he probably is. It's okay.

846
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:58,280
It's okay. I will tell you that that
will come back to haunt him eventually.

847
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:00,530
Maybe not this year,
maybe not next year,

848
00:53:00,531 --> 00:53:05,450
maybe in five years people are going
to see through that eventually and you

849
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:11,290
who's doing the right things for the
right reasons you will win in the end.

850
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:15,930
Yeah.

851
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:20,570
When we talked about this a lot where
if you're doing it just to get the

852
00:53:20,571 --> 00:53:24,520
promotion, they're going to see that
man, I get to smell it. That guy.

853
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:26,070
Yeah and not only

854
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,560
is the basket,
everyone's going to smell it on you.

855
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:32,090
I talked about that earlier tonight,
cause if you were going to, if you like,

856
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:35,710
if you volunteer to be
the admiral's aid yeah.

857
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:39,780
Then then that was a total red
flag. Watch out for this guy. Yeah,

858
00:53:39,781 --> 00:53:42,570
I see what you're doing. Yeah.
You don't want to be that guy.

859
00:53:42,571 --> 00:53:45,900
You want to be doing the right things
for the right reasons. Yeah. And that is,

860
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:50,930
that is how in the long run you will get
the recognition and the promotions and

861
00:53:52,261 --> 00:53:54,830
the credit that you deserve.
Because why wouldn't you? Yeah.

862
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:57,930
You're busting your ass to do a great job.
You're gonna get,

863
00:53:57,931 --> 00:54:00,090
you're gonna shine eventually gammon.

864
00:54:00,091 --> 00:54:03,520
And if you're focused on doing the
best job you can do. That's the bit,

865
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:06,810
that's really the,
the dynamics of promotions anyway.

866
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:09,660
It or it should be ideally shouldn't.

867
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:14,640
For me it was definitely over time it
will be because there is somebody that

868
00:54:14,641 --> 00:54:16,610
Brown noses. The boss. Yeah.

869
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:22,160
That maneuvers to take these little
missions or to do things to get the

870
00:54:22,681 --> 00:54:25,900
recognition that he's there. There's
a guy that's doing that, you know,

871
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:30,950
and they can't get promoted and you
gotta accept that and not succumb to it,

872
00:54:31,981 --> 00:54:35,160
not submit to it. Cause you don't
want to be that guy in the long run.

873
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:38,940
The guy that busts his ass that takes
cares of his troops that towed the party

874
00:54:38,941 --> 00:54:42,630
line that does the right things for the
right reasons is going to win in the end.

875
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:46,570
You got to believe in that. And then you
know, guys do that in Jujitsu, right?

876
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:48,600
Sometimes the,
we talked about that too where they have,

877
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:51,420
they do they have the wrong mindset.
They just want that purple belt,

878
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:54,680
Brown belt or whatever. Yeah.
They want the next belt. Um,

879
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:57,240
or I want to tap that guy or I
want to tap this. Right. Yeah.

880
00:54:57,241 --> 00:55:01,620
Those are the wrong reasons. Yeah.
Folks that, yeah. If the guys who,

881
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:05,580
who are just in it to be
the best that they can be.

882
00:55:05,581 --> 00:55:08,760
You see them asking questions or
going over some stuff, you know,

883
00:55:08,761 --> 00:55:10,910
on their own kind of thing where they,

884
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,340
they just want to learn as much as they
can and get good at as much as they can.

885
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:19,020
And in the long run, those are going
to be the, the guys that shine. Yeah.

886
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:22,170
And men. And I think that, I think that's,

887
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:27,090
it's such a huge deal and it goes for
Jujitsu or even that at work or whatever.

888
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:32,310
And if you're the guy who they can see
what you're doing and you're kissing ass

889
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:34,080
or, or like the guy. Okay.

890
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:37,470
This is one of the most embarrassing
things you can do in my opinion,

891
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:42,471
in Jujitsu is after a promotion you didn't
get promoted and then you're overtly

892
00:55:43,891 --> 00:55:48,891
unhappy about it and don't go one
step further and say something about,

893
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:53,550
Oh, I tapped that guy all the time and
he got his belt. Ooh, don't ever do it.

894
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:58,410
Don't do it. Don't tell
you, don't do it. Yeah. That
doesn't, that doesn't bode well.

895
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:02,340
I don't think you could ever really
live that down. It's just unnecessary.

896
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:06,330
It just shows, hey guys, look at
me. I'm focused on the wrong thing.

897
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:11,010
I'm focused on like wearing a belt
rather than my skill. You know?

898
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:14,610
I'd rather get a belt and
maybe not have the skill.

899
00:56:14,611 --> 00:56:18,990
I'd rather that then had the skill
and maybe not have the belt right now.

900
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,620
That's what you're saying. Oh
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

901
00:56:22,621 --> 00:56:27,621
If it is that any good Jujitsu guy would
rather have the skill and not have the

902
00:56:29,111 --> 00:56:32,500
belt right now, by the way, you
don't have the belt right now.

903
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,780
If you have the skill, you'll get the
belts, you know, that's just part of the,

904
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:40,540
you don't want, it could be a long time.
Yeah. And you know what? That's okay. Oh,

905
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:43,870
unless you quit, then you won't have, oh,
you know, then you won't have the belt.

906
00:56:43,871 --> 00:56:47,020
But that's where you got to also accept
the fact that some guy's going to get

907
00:56:47,021 --> 00:56:51,640
promoted to head of you. Good. Good thing
you good? You tapped them before. Good,

908
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:56,080
good. That's perfect. Keep that up.
Yeah, we going to get you that belt.

909
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:59,680
Stop whining.
I heard of a guy who left the gym,

910
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:04,270
our gym because he didn't get a belt.
And you have a site called,

911
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:07,000
I'm just gonna go somewhere
else. Yeah, that's too bad.

912
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:12,460
I just heard it was a story. I
wasn't there enough anywhere.

913
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:17,260
Next question, unless we have more
on that one. No, we're good. Good.

914
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:21,010
Dead horse has been beaten.
Yeah, don't be that guy, man.

915
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:26,950
Jocko on team building.
When leading a team,

916
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:32,580
do you feel that there's any benefit
to team building exercises or retreats?

917
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:35,980
Well,

918
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:40,980
this is a interesting question
that actually I feel that

919
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:44,430
fairly qualified to answer because we,
we Lafe and I,

920
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,730
we have a little business called
echelon front where that's a,

921
00:57:47,731 --> 00:57:49,980
we work with a lot of different
companies on a different,

922
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:53,010
a wide range of different categories.

923
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,980
Sometimes we go in and work with
a business. Sometimes we go on,

924
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:57,480
we'll do a keynote speech for a business,

925
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:03,260
like there'll be having a big meeting
and we'll go in and do one keynote speech

926
00:58:04,321 --> 00:58:05,640
for an hour and we leave and we're done.

927
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:10,840
But most of the time we're doing more
long range stuff where we spend time with

928
00:58:10,841 --> 00:58:11,730
the company we go in.

929
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:17,090
But oftentimes we do do some kind of
situation where their company has decided

930
00:58:19,231 --> 00:58:23,790
to do some kind of a leadership offsite
or a team building exercise or a

931
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:28,260
leadership retreat. And we, we mostly
get involved with the leadership,

932
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:31,800
although that does sometimes
trickle down to where we're,

933
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:35,880
we'll do some work with all
the frontline troops. Um,

934
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:38,640
so we constantly see these,

935
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:43,020
these leadership off sites and
we speak and, or lead them.

936
00:58:43,021 --> 00:58:44,460
Sometimes we run the whole thing.

937
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:49,980
And there are definitely some outstanding
events and we'd been participated in

938
00:58:49,981 --> 00:58:54,570
and led some outstanding events
with, with companies. And I think

939
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:58,580
one of the most important things
about these offsites is it,

940
00:58:58,581 --> 00:59:03,581
it forces the leadership team to detach
from the day to day firefights of what

941
00:59:03,691 --> 00:59:05,330
the business has.
No matter what the there,

942
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:09,270
there's no businesses where the CEO and
the c suite or like sitting around not

943
00:59:09,271 --> 00:59:12,120
doing anything, they, those,
those companies don't exist.

944
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:15,570
That at least that I've seen those,
you know, you're trying to expand,

945
00:59:15,571 --> 00:59:19,080
you're trying to grow, you've got com
competitors making moves. So you're,

946
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:21,680
you're in the fight and then you've
got operational things are happening.

947
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:24,700
So you're in the fight. So when you
do these leadership offsites there,

948
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:29,710
it's good that you get them to focus on
some other development in some whatever

949
00:59:30,531 --> 00:59:33,200
issues they're having in areas
where they can improve. So there,

950
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:38,230
it gives them the opportunity to focus
on those things and also gives them the

951
00:59:38,481 --> 00:59:43,481
opportunity to self assess as a team
how they're doing and themselves as

952
00:59:45,411 --> 00:59:48,080
leaders,
how they're doing.

953
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:53,990
And when I talked to
people about leadership and
teamwork and the short falls

954
00:59:54,551 --> 00:59:58,340
and the pitfalls that exist, and then
when I, when they hear me talk about it,

955
00:59:58,341 --> 01:00:02,420
they recognize their own weaknesses.
I, every time I get done they go, man,

956
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:06,680
when you were talking about,
you know when you were talking about ego,

957
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:10,040
sometimes I think I let my ego get in
the way or that when you were talking

958
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:11,520
about covering movement,
I don't think I'd,

959
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:13,370
well when you're talking about ownership,
they,

960
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:18,490
they see areas of their own weaknesses
and they see where they can improve and

961
01:00:20,121 --> 01:00:24,530
then when you get the whole team that's
all learning that same information,

962
01:00:24,531 --> 01:00:29,531
they're all doing that same
self assessment and then
the whole leadership team

963
01:00:30,171 --> 01:00:35,171
gets aligned to behind the same leadership
principles of ownership and humility

964
01:00:37,131 --> 01:00:39,140
and cover and move and
simple decentralized command.

965
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:42,980
And all of those things that I talk
about that is extremely powerful.

966
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:45,170
It is extremely powerful

967
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:51,670
and we see really drastic turnarounds
with the companies that we work with and

968
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:56,060
has awesome. It's awesome
to see. And then one,

969
01:00:56,061 --> 01:00:59,600
one thing that we do when we work
more in depth with a company,

970
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:04,610
we do our own leadership off sites
where we do simulated combat.

971
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:09,770
And I know it sounds it. It sounds if,
if I wouldn't have done it so many times,

972
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:14,270
I would be surprised that it's, it's
possible, but we take either paint guns,

973
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:19,510
paintball guns or air soft guns and we
teach them the basic shooting principals

974
01:01:20,931 --> 01:01:24,560
and we teach them some basic small
unit tactics and then we go and perform

975
01:01:24,561 --> 01:01:28,430
mission. We have them perform missions
and every time they got eight guys,

976
01:01:28,431 --> 01:01:30,650
they got 10 guys, they got 12 guys, girls,

977
01:01:30,651 --> 01:01:34,070
whatever in their group and
they go and assault a target.

978
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:37,010
They come up with a plan,
they go out,

979
01:01:37,011 --> 01:01:41,960
we put one person in charge and that
person has to lead a mission and they,

980
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:47,330
what they theorized
in the classroom,

981
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:52,040
they now get to put to the test and they
learn those lessons very, very clearly.

982
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:53,210
You know,
we,

983
01:01:53,211 --> 01:01:58,130
we'd see a guy that would be a really
strong leader and he was like, okay,

984
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:00,980
I'm the, I'm in charge of this
run. Here's what I'm going to do.

985
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:02,960
Here's the way the plants could go down.
You're going to do this,

986
01:02:02,961 --> 01:02:03,890
you're going to this,
you're going to this.

987
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:08,450
You see that micromanagement start and
then as soon as they start the operation,

988
01:02:08,451 --> 01:02:12,740
everyone is expecting to get micromanaged.
So no one's thinking on their own.

989
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,330
So now you get a decentralize,

990
01:02:14,331 --> 01:02:17,990
a lack of decentralized
command and everything goes
sideways and nobody does and

991
01:02:17,991 --> 01:02:20,010
he thinks it all being
waiting to be told what to do.

992
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:25,140
So that's an example of the kinds
of things that people learn. Um,

993
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:31,320
so with all that, yes,
absolutely. We, you know,

994
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,780
I've been to,
and we run some,

995
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,950
some pretty awesome dean building
exercises and retreats and leadership off

996
01:02:37,951 --> 01:02:42,390
sites that are, that are great and
we've seen awesome results from a wall.

997
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:48,210
I've also sat through some off sites
that are, that are not that effective.

998
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:50,250
Um,
you know,

999
01:02:50,251 --> 01:02:54,180
you get situations where people don't
open up or there's no exchange or you get

1000
01:02:54,181 --> 01:02:56,610
these team building exercises that,

1001
01:02:56,611 --> 01:03:01,020
that some people set up and there's some
kind of physical or mental challenge.

1002
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:06,560
And while they might be hard and they
might take some teamwork to perform,

1003
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:11,730
they don't break the paradigm
that the company is in.

1004
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,600
So they'll end up leading through
that challenge or whatever it is.

1005
01:03:15,601 --> 01:03:17,910
Whether it's a,
some kind of a PT,

1006
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:21,330
some kind of physical training or some
kind of a boat race or something like

1007
01:03:21,331 --> 01:03:24,480
that. They'll lead through that
challenge. The way they always lead,

1008
01:03:24,481 --> 01:03:25,650
the way they currently lead.

1009
01:03:25,651 --> 01:03:29,400
So nothing is learned and nothing is
gained and no leadership advancement has

1010
01:03:29,401 --> 01:03:33,870
been made and all they've done is
actually all they've actually done is

1011
01:03:33,871 --> 01:03:37,230
reinforce the bad leadership
situation that they already have.

1012
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,010
So that's,

1013
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:45,630
that's one of the things that I've seen
that can be problematic and that's why

1014
01:03:45,631 --> 01:03:49,830
we've gone to the direction that we
go, where we really focus on, let's do,

1015
01:03:49,831 --> 01:03:54,600
let's look at leadership and
the team working together,

1016
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:58,530
how, what the leadership dynamics are,
what our weaknesses are, what we see,

1017
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:02,430
where we uncover the friction, where we
see the team not working well together.

1018
01:04:02,431 --> 01:04:04,410
Where we see the leaders
not stepping up and leading,

1019
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:07,590
where we see the leaders
egos get in the way. I mean,

1020
01:04:07,591 --> 01:04:12,050
there's so many things that we uncover
and find. It's, it's phenomenal. And it,

1021
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:14,770
and it really does make it fun for us,
you know,

1022
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:17,970
because every time you see a
new leadership team, you, it's,

1023
01:04:17,971 --> 01:04:22,971
it's like diagnosing a patient and you,

1024
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:25,950
you look at the problems that they're
having. They say, oh, well, you know what,

1025
01:04:25,951 --> 01:04:28,920
try this over here. Take this off a
little bit. And the next thing you know,

1026
01:04:28,921 --> 01:04:32,520
you've got that patient up and
running and they're winning.

1027
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:37,750
Or like a mechanic when he grabs the
car. Right? Yeah. You know, uh, yeah,

1028
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:40,470
some of those leadership, or not
leadership necessarily, but these,

1029
01:04:40,471 --> 01:04:42,420
these teen building retreats too,

1030
01:04:42,421 --> 01:04:47,250
sometimes it seems like whoever organized
them really wasn't focusing on results.

1031
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:51,330
They're just focusing on our
annual, uh, you know, retreat.

1032
01:04:51,331 --> 01:04:55,040
So they make it in like The Bahamas
and all these, um, you know,

1033
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:57,110
these activities are like kind of fun,
you know?

1034
01:04:57,140 --> 01:05:00,770
Then every once in a while I've been in
Administrative Ping or something. Yeah.

1035
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:03,600
And Fun can be part of it. You know,
there's, there's bonding that happens,

1036
01:05:03,601 --> 01:05:06,730
there's getting to know each other
and that's always positive. Um,

1037
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:11,890
but the, if you're, I'm all about
having fun. I'm all about bonding,

1038
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:17,340
but I'm even more about learning
even more about improving the guy,

1039
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:18,130
the people

1040
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:21,760
we work with,
the guys and girls that we work with.

1041
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,930
I want them to be better leaders.
Right? That's what I want. Yeah,

1042
01:05:25,931 --> 01:05:28,900
that's what I'm saying.
And so I, yeah, sure.

1043
01:05:28,901 --> 01:05:33,610
Do I want them to get some team
challenges? Yes. But like I said,

1044
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:37,000
I don't want that to just reinforce the
paradigm that they're already in the

1045
01:05:37,001 --> 01:05:41,020
leadership paradigm with authority in.
I want them to improve.

1046
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:45,490
So let's actually break down and look and,

1047
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:50,580
and analyze and diagnose what the
issues are and then let's solve them.

1048
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:54,160
And you know, it's not, it's not always,

1049
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:57,850
it's not always that these teams
go in and there we, you know,

1050
01:05:57,851 --> 01:06:00,490
we don't get hired by companies
that are failing. In fact,

1051
01:06:00,491 --> 01:06:03,910
most of the time we get hired by
companies that are doing well,

1052
01:06:03,911 --> 01:06:08,530
that want to do better. So when I say we
diagnose, diagnose what the problem is,

1053
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:10,280
it's not,
it's,

1054
01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:14,170
it's not a problem where it's
causing the company to failure,

1055
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:18,610
but it's a friction point where it is
holding the company back from really

1056
01:06:18,611 --> 01:06:23,611
reaching the Beck's best next level and
going from being a really good company

1057
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:28,850
or even an outstanding company to
the best in class company. Gotcha.

1058
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:34,090
So it's like a, it's like a
multivitamin, not a painkiller. Yes.

1059
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:38,620
No, that's not mine. Other than
I read that somewhere. You know,

1060
01:06:38,621 --> 01:06:39,970
the micromanaging thing,

1061
01:06:41,590 --> 01:06:45,990
it's funny because you're the first
person that I've heard say that this were

1062
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:49,900
where you said they'll start micromanaging
and then all of a sudden the people

1063
01:06:49,901 --> 01:06:54,100
getting micro-melt managed expect to
get micromanage. So they stop thinking.

1064
01:06:54,101 --> 01:06:58,180
Right. So in a percent, so yeah, and
that happens. It goes the other way too.

1065
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:01,120
If you come to me and you say, Hey
Jocko, how do you want me to do this?

1066
01:07:01,121 --> 01:07:04,970
And I go figure it out. And you say, Hey
boss, can you show me how to do this?

1067
01:07:04,971 --> 01:07:07,540
And I say, figure it out.
When we get in the field,

1068
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:12,850
you're going to know that I expect you
to figure it out, right? Yeah, man.

1069
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:15,520
Like when I,
when I drive with my life,

1070
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:19,810
she'll start micromanaging like how
I drive, like get in this lane or,

1071
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:24,640
or um, you know, just you're
going too slow or too fast,

1072
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,110
too fast, whatever to slow, typically
cold blooded. But here's the thing,

1073
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:33,250
I'm not going to lose my temper, you know,
I don't think front seat in her case,

1074
01:07:33,251 --> 01:07:36,880
but yeah, man, for sure. And I'm not
gonna lose my temper. It'd be like, okay.

1075
01:07:36,881 --> 01:07:39,760
But that's what I do. I shut
down my brain. And then,

1076
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:44,110
so one time David was riding with us
and he was, uh, like it was actually,

1077
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:47,620
I was micromanaging jade and
he put it in these good terms,

1078
01:07:47,621 --> 01:07:52,120
which I thought were good. He said
either be the navigator hundred percent,

1079
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:55,360
cause he stopped thinking, you
know, or don't be it at all.

1080
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:59,200
You can't just start chiming in when
you think I'm going too slow, you know?

1081
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:03,340
Otherwise, yeah. I don't want them.
If Sarah is yelling at me, hey,

1082
01:08:03,341 --> 01:08:06,220
you're going too slow, I'm going to be
like, okay, how fast do you want me to go?

1083
01:08:06,221 --> 01:08:09,490
I'll go that fast.
So if you're navigating the on the map,

1084
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,940
you're going to have to tell me
every turn to make. Don't say, Hey,

1085
01:08:12,941 --> 01:08:15,830
you're going to make this right. And then
I make the right thing. You sign off,

1086
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:19,890
you know, cause you're, you're
anticipating the micromanager.
Exactly. Right, man.

1087
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,340
And I think it kind of goes automatically.
You know,

1088
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:26,150
you got to put in a lot of materials
where you knew that Sarah never said

1089
01:08:26,151 --> 01:08:27,770
anything to you when you got in the car.
All me,

1090
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:31,010
you'd know that you had to have the route
prepped before you got in the vehicle.

1091
01:08:31,011 --> 01:08:33,150
Yet we might go a little bit too slow.
But Stillman,

1092
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:38,120
W it's all me as far as thinking
goes, yeah man, don't micromanage.

1093
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:40,580
Or when you micromanage,

1094
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:43,940
don't expect them to just all of
a sudden start making, you know,

1095
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:49,000
creative decisions. It's just hard. It's
hard. It's hard for it to work that way.

1096
01:08:49,001 --> 01:08:53,540
Amen. All right, next
question. This is the last one.

1097
01:08:58,340 --> 01:08:59,173
Jacko.

1098
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:04,180
Could you tell us any possible regrets
or things you'd done differently?

1099
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:09,290
Something you'd wished
you'd learned sooner.

1100
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:17,310
Regrets.
Things I could've done differently.

1101
01:09:17,311 --> 01:09:19,410
Things I wish I learned sooner.

1102
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:22,173
Okay.

1103
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:27,230
Of course there are things
I wish I learned sooner.

1104
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:31,850
There's,
there's so much knowledge out there,

1105
01:09:31,851 --> 01:09:35,390
so much information,
so many ways to get better.

1106
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:37,953
Okay?

1107
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:42,620
And we make,
we make so many mistakes.

1108
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:44,953
What are the,

1109
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:50,050
we're the product of our mistakes and
oftentimes the lesson is sitting there

1110
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:56,660
right in front of our face.
It's there to be learned,

1111
01:09:56,661 --> 01:10:00,950
but we miss it or we don't pay attention
to it or we think we know better

1112
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:07,280
until it punches
in the face.

1113
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:16,310
In. The most important thing to learn
is that we have so much to learn.

1114
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:18,433
We all do.

1115
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:24,280
And we can learn from school and from
people and from experience and we learned

1116
01:10:25,371 --> 01:10:26,240
from life.

1117
01:10:30,210 --> 01:10:34,440
But you have to process the information.

1118
01:10:34,441 --> 01:10:37,560
You have to absorb it.
You have to except it,

1119
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:40,190
you have to open your mind.

1120
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:45,200
You got to free your mind so that
you can learn and make real progress.

1121
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:53,893
Okay.

1122
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:59,410
In this far as regrets and things
I wish I would've done differently.

1123
01:11:00,311 --> 01:11:03,250
Of course,
hindsight,

1124
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:08,110
hindsight is 2020 and looking back,
of course,

1125
01:11:08,111 --> 01:11:12,370
who wouldn't want to take another go at
something and improve on the first try

1126
01:11:12,371 --> 01:11:13,204
by doing it.

1127
01:11:14,930 --> 01:11:15,290
Okay.

1128
01:11:15,290 --> 01:11:18,980
And then why not do it
again and again and again.

1129
01:11:18,981 --> 01:11:23,981
And why not just do it over and over
again until you have it perfect.

1130
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:33,220
But the fact is you don't get that chance.

1131
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:35,210
Yeah.

1132
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:37,190
You get one shot,

1133
01:11:38,150 --> 01:11:42,850
one shot at this gig right here.
Good life.

1134
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:44,360
Yeah.

1135
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,490
One life.
That's all you've got.

1136
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:48,330
Okay.

1137
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:51,840
And regret in and of itself.

1138
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:59,210
It's worthless. It does
nothing for you. In fact,

1139
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:03,680
the only valuable thing and
regret is the lesson you learned,

1140
01:12:05,710 --> 01:12:07,750
the knowledge that you gained,

1141
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:14,850
but walking around filled
with regret gets you nothing.

1142
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:21,180
So learn and move on.

1143
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:27,300
Don't let regret beat you down.
Don't be a slave to regret.

1144
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:30,780
No.
Let it teach you.

1145
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:32,880
Let it make you better.

1146
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:41,070
Let the fear of regret fueled
you to take action the day now.

1147
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:46,200
Okay.

1148
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:51,200
To take action now to
become a better person.

1149
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:54,000
Not filled with regret.

1150
01:12:56,150 --> 01:12:56,820
Okay.

1151
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:59,100
But filled with knowledge,

1152
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:04,820
filled with knowledge,

1153
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:09,320
had strength and power and filled with

1154
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:10,720
yeah,

1155
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:11,553
life.

1156
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:18,760
Yeah,

1157
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:22,510
and I think that's all
I've got for tonight.

1158
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,350
No regrets.

1159
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:33,330
Only knowledge and that's what we are
striving for on this podcast to gain

1160
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:41,700
knowledge so we can improve
ourselves and live better lives.

1161

1170
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:23,104
do that shopping,

1171
01:14:23,810 --> 01:14:28,330
go to Jocko podcast.com or [inaudible]
dot com click on the Amazon link.

1172
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:31,840
That's pretty cool. Yes,
you're buying it anyways.

1173
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:37,000
I know you love Amazon because I love
Amazon because it is a squared away system

1174
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:41,440
that delivers things to
your home in hours or days.

1175
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:46,030
And all you gotta do if you want to
help us out is you just got to go there,

1176
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:49,300
go to site, just go to our site
first, click on it, and then boom,

1177
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:53,530
they're not taking more money from you.
They're taking their money and giving it,

1178
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:59,100
they're taking their money and giving
it to support the Jocko podcast,

1179
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:03,430
which is pretty impressive. So
that's much appreciated. Yeah.

1180
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:05,980
So if you're buying some duck
tape or something, the key,

1181
01:15:05,981 --> 01:15:10,560
the challenge is remembering to go
right Jocko podcast.com but man,

1182
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:14,500
why you always say duck tape?
Do you get a lot of duct tape from Amazon?

1183
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:20,200
I've gotten, yeah, I always say if
you need duct tape, man, go to Amazon.

1184
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,210
I said it once and it kind of stuck.

1185
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:28,250
Duck tailed it anyway that I slept with
guy actually still watch one guy wrote

1186
01:15:28,251 --> 01:15:32,050
all the time. That was his thing, man.
Duct tape don't go anywhere without it.

1187
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:35,260
In the military we call it rigorous tape.
Yeah.

1188
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:38,190
And some people call it
120 mile an hour tape,

1189
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:42,550
but I've never called it that one time.
Yeah, but we call the rigors tape. Yeah,

1190
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:47,740
yeah. I got some black
rigorous data. Nonetheless,

1191
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:51,280
if you're getting some or anything
on amazon.com and just try,

1192
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:55,210
if you can just remember to go to Jocko
podcast.com first click on the Amazon

1193
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:58,840
Lincoln booms, automatic supporting
podcasts and we thank you for that.

1194
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:02,830
I thank you for that chocolate things.
And um,

1195
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:06,430
while you're at Jocko store,
if you like any of the shirts,

1196
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:10,870
go ahead,
grab one or a coffee mug or a sticker.

1197
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:14,830
That's a good way to support this
shirt that you're wearing tonight.

1198
01:16:14,830 --> 01:16:17,170
It's a little bit new, isn't
it? It's a little new. Yes.

1199
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:20,650
The newest one looks right here.
If you're watching on youtube,

1200
01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:25,660
if you're not watching on youtube,
the front of the shirt,

1201
01:16:25,661 --> 01:16:30,661
it's a black on black shirt and
black on the front it says no,

1202
01:16:30,971 --> 01:16:35,050
the darkness, you'll actually,
ironically, if you're watching on youtube,

1203
01:16:35,051 --> 01:16:38,800
you might not even be able to see
no. The darkness. And let's say,

1204
01:16:38,801 --> 01:16:41,620
and I mentioned this before,
this, when we made this one,

1205
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:45,430
there's that added layer where it's dark,
the shirt is for you.

1206
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:48,850
It's not to show everyone who look at me,
look at my cool shirt.

1207
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,440
The shirt is for you.
You know it's there.

1208
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:55,400
Ain't know my back has got some madness,
some dark, dark, dark, dark picture.

1209
01:16:55,750 --> 01:17:00,400
Yup. So easy you do the
shirts, right? I mean,

1210
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:05,090
so this must, what did that like we've
talked about a lot of stuff. Why,

1211
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,960
why did you, why did you go
with the darkness? Why did you,

1212
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:12,560
why was that important you that was the
main theme. Remember? Like when you,

1213
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:15,890
when you started or what? Well, okay.

1214
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:20,690
When Jocko started the main theme and
still is the main theme where he goes into

1215
01:17:20,691 --> 01:17:24,530
all these dark books and,
and concepts.

1216
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:27,530
And then every time,
like even Tim Kennedy,

1217
01:17:27,531 --> 01:17:30,990
when we asked him or one of the questions
was like, hey, how do you, you know,

1218
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:32,840
reconcile,
you know,

1219
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:37,870
being happy or anything that when you've
seen so much darkness and it actually

1220
01:17:38,391 --> 01:17:42,050
intensifies your happiness because
you can recognize the good stuff.

1221
01:17:42,051 --> 01:17:46,340
So no,
the darkness so you can see the light.

1222
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:48,650
That's kind of the, the
phrase there, right.

1223
01:17:48,651 --> 01:17:51,860
So you can appreciate good things way
more when you know bad things and that

1224
01:17:51,861 --> 01:17:53,000
goes for everything really.

1225
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:58,430
So you didn't make a
shirt that said be happy,

1226
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:02,420
the light is with us because
you could have made that,

1227
01:18:02,421 --> 01:18:06,770
I guess kind of inconsistent though
with the whole feel of thing.

1228
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:11,510
And the bottom line is if you're
surrounded by all the happiness,

1229
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:14,960
it starts to fade. Right?
Right. Yeah, man. Yeah, exactly.

1230
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:18,740
Let's not make a happy shirt.
Let's make a dark shirt. Yeah.

1231
01:18:18,930 --> 01:18:20,840
Maybe it's your sick
happy shirt in the future.

1232
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:24,500
But I'm saying for right now
that's where you were feeling.

1233
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:26,690
That's what his feelings. Yeah,
I thought it was appropriate.

1234
01:18:26,691 --> 01:18:30,080
I thought it was good. I think
it came out good man. I dig it.

1235
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:35,120
There you go. Or if you like any of the
other ones, discipline equals freedom.

1236
01:18:35,121 --> 01:18:36,820
That was a cool one too, I think. Yeah.

1237
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:41,900
Or the one with your head on it anyway
that you can see on whatever 11 I still

1238
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:46,850
haven't seen alive, alive
one in the wild. Like,

1239
01:18:46,851 --> 01:18:50,870
I haven't seen travel. I travel all the
time. I haven't seen it at trooper yet.

1240
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:55,720
Just just representing person.
No,

1241
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:59,810
I'm here. I never, I
never have taken a Selfie,

1242
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:02,000
but I think I might do a selfie if I,
if I,

1243
01:19:02,001 --> 01:19:07,001
if I see a person in the wild good trooper
out there just represent and hardcore

1244
01:19:07,101 --> 01:19:10,340
in an airport somewhere coming straight
up, we can do some burpees and then

1245
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:16,850
you kind of, yeah, I seen
him here. Yeah. In San Diego.

1246
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:19,850
But those are our people.
We know everybody. Yeah.

1247
01:19:19,851 --> 01:19:24,710
But I've seen one where I didn't know,
you know, like I didn't know that,

1248
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:29,750
you know, that. Um, like does that
person know I knew him. I know him count,

1249
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:31,820
but I didn't know like
he got a shirt and stuff.

1250
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:36,850
I want to be in Indianapolis or I want
to be in Philadelphia and be walking down

1251
01:19:37,011 --> 01:19:41,720
the street and see some guide is a
represent and hardcore in the street.

1252
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:43,640
That'd be awesome.
Well,

1253
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:47,510
I can attest that with the online stuff
I've seen the people representing,

1254
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:52,010
they are representing hardcore.
Yeah. Uh, anything else?

1255
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:56,690
Nope. That's it. If you, if you like it,
just grab one if you want. Right on. Well,

1256
01:19:57,530 --> 01:19:58,430
as always,

1257
01:19:59,210 --> 01:20:03,350
if you want to continue
this conversation with us,

1258
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:08,040
all these questions we answered
tonight now from guys there, from the

1259
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,830
troopers there from you all.
So thank you for doing that.

1260
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:14,340
We are on the interwebs on Twitter.

1261
01:20:15,330 --> 01:20:17,340
Echo Charles is at echo.

1262
01:20:17,341 --> 01:20:20,850
Charles and I am at Jocko Willink.

1263
01:20:20,851 --> 01:20:24,510
We're also on the Facebook and Instagram.
If you care,

1264
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:31,490
that's where we are and we're
trying to get better. Hey,

1265
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:35,550
you can join us there as
we seek knowledge together

1266
01:20:38,090 --> 01:20:38,990
and get after it.

1267
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:43,750
So until next time,

1268
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,420
this is echo and Jocko out.
