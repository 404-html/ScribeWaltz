00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,730
This is Jocko podcast number
one 31 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,590
Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo and good
evening. It is time for some Q and. A.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,090
Yes. Should we banter around for a
while? She would just get started.

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,440
Question number one.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,830
I've been somewhat of a pushover for the
majority of my life since listening to

6
00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:25,080
the podcast.
I've been trying to assert myself more.

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,890
One thing I can't seem to shake
is constantly being interrupted.

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,540
How can I rise above and
overcome this obstacle?

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,150
Should I re read the Hashtag,
the Hashtag fellow hardcore

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,130
hardcore and there's a little layer in
there cause he put rise above and there.

11
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:48,570
So I,
so I thought about this because

12
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,750
I would say I don't get interrupted
a lot. Yeah. But I don't,

13
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,810
I think that's kind of the current state
of me and I think there's a reason why

14
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:01,650
I don't get interrupted a lot.

15
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,750
And it's not because you know
people are going to think,

16
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:08,370
oh well that's because you're going to
bash people in the head with a club.

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,210
That's not the actual answer
of why I don't get interrupted.

18
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:16,860
So one thing I think is important is,
you've heard me say this before,

19
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:18,540
the less people talk,
the more people listen.

20
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,260
So when I'm in a group of people that all
want to talk and they all want to talk

21
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:25,980
over each other and they
want to cut each other off,

22
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:31,260
you get in that group right
there. I don't talk, I don't talk.

23
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:34,890
I let them, I sit there, I
listened to him and I plot.

24
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:36,661
Then I think,

25
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:41,661
and I put together my thoughts correctly
so that when I do decide to say

26
00:01:42,031 --> 00:01:44,850
something it's going to have impact

27
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,330
and then I wait for the right moment.
Right.

28
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:50,220
Because if there's people that
are bickering back and forth,

29
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,790
I wait for a lull in the fire

30
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,880
and when that low comes,

31
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,610
then I make my point in a very
direct manner. I might even,

32
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:07,410
I might even have to wait
until the conversation is
like all but over wait until

33
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:12,390
they're done with their little
firefight. Get Pip. Yup, Yup, Yup,

34
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:15,780
Yup, Yup, Yup, Yup, Yup, Yup, Yup, Yup.

35
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,690
And then I'm not talking, they're
done. And what I, when I talk,

36
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:23,850
you know I'm going to do it.
Since I've been thinking about it,

37
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:28,080
it's going to be articulated in a
way that I can present my full point.

38
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,230
And so I think that's an effective
way to do things. I think.

39
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,290
I think if you let people speak a bunch,

40
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,640
you let them get it out of their system
and then when you decide to talk,

41
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:41,460
they don't have anything left to say.
So that's a way to stop getting cut off.

42
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,170
So this is almost like flanking,
right?

43
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,610
This is a flanking the fact that when
people have a bunch to say and they got

44
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:49,680
all these thoughts in their head
and they want to get them all out,

45
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,410
let them get them out.
Don't try and fight that battle.

46
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,130
They've got a bunch of things they want
to say. Let them say it. Also, as we know,

47
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,250
when you listen to
someone else talk it you,

48
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,660
you now know what their ideas are.
You know what they're thinking.

49
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:08,320
There's a power and not saying anything
because it allows you to think and it

50
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,820
allows you to hear what
other people think.

51
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:12,460
And it allows you to hear other people.

52
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:16,480
So in a conversation you get to hear
other people's counters to what people are

53
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:18,010
saying and you're not,

54
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,390
you're not having to expend any ammunition
yourself. Someone else is doing it.

55
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:22,930
You know,
the,

56
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,870
the third or fourth or fifth piece person
in the conversation that's expanding

57
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:30,220
ammunition and running their mouth to
try and counter some point that someone's

58
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:32,500
man let them do that.
Because by the way,

59
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:33,940
then you get to see what
the other counter is.

60
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,020
So I think being assertive
doesn't mean talking more.

61
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,500
I think being assertive
means talking less,

62
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,630
talking at the appropriate times,

63
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,750
monitoring and understanding the firefight
that's happening so that when other

64
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:54,190
people have expended their ammunition,

65
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:59,530
you can step in and you can take
your shots in a simple, clear,

66
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,300
concise manner. That's what I
think. Yeah, I think you're right.

67
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,880
I think you built up
this reputation though.

68
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:09,970
That's an added element to
your specific situation.

69
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:15,100
When you talk it like you're not
saying fluff, you know you're,

70
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,100
you know when you talk if like something,
well that's a good point.

71
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,370
So if you don't want to get caught off
and 70% of the things that you say aren't

72
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:29,680
really that impactful and don't
add a lot to the conversation,

73
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,000
well then there's a good chance that when
you open your mouth to start talking,

74
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:35,680
someone else doesn't think
it's gonna be important.

75
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,460
So they just jump right on top of you.
But if you say less and to your point,

76
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,660
if the things that you say generally
are well thought out and clear and are

77
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:44,650
going to have impact,

78
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,120
well then we have a good chance that
you're not going to be cut off because

79
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:51,820
people actually want to hear
what you're going to say. Yeah.

80
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,840
Don't talk just to talk ever. Yeah. See.
And that's a hard, I shouldn't say ever,

81
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:58,820
but hardly ever.
Yeah,

82
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,100
that's a hard one because it,

83
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,830
and it's not like people are interrupting
you on purpose because you don't have

84
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,980
nothing to sit, you know, like you're
just talking fluff. That's nice.

85
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:11,740
Not a conscious on purpose thing.
A lot of the times I think anyway,

86
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,510
it doesn't feel like it is. Um, it feels
like it's like subconscious, you know,

87
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,320
like how can someone see fit to actually
follow through with interrupting

88
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:24,310
somebody if they don't think like,
okay, this isn't quite that important.

89
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,323
At the very least,

90
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,540
the very least what I'm about to
interrupt with is more important.

91
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,810
So some people think that what they're
about to say is really important.

92
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,950
Here's another thing, it's like the
little boy that cried wolf, right? If I,

93
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,620
if I talk and talk and
talk and talk and talk,

94
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:44,220
I'm taking away the value of each one
of those statements that I make because

95
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:47,650
I'm making so many statements that not
all of them can have a high level of

96
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:51,220
value. So w w, w who do you,

97
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,710
who do you pay more attention to?

98
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,860
The person that makes a hundred
statements and are those, okay.

99
00:05:57,861 --> 00:05:59,960
Let's say you want to pay attention to
the person that makes 100 statements.

100
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,010
How much can you pay attention to those
hundred statements? How much do you,

101
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,110
how much do you gather from those
hundred statements? Yeah. Well, it's,

102
00:06:07,111 --> 00:06:11,510
it's a limited amount.
Yeah, it's 1% per statement,

103
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,350
right? What's 1% you
have to fool. He will.

104
00:06:14,351 --> 00:06:16,790
Do you think I make some
statements at the 1% per statement?

105
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,920
If the person says one thing,

106
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,820
how much percent do you pay attention to
that on dad's retinue seven to 100% so

107
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,680
there you go. Yeah, it
makes sense to check.

108
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,950
Good luck with that fellow hardcore kid.
So I guess he'd kind of have,

109
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,090
I mean assuming that you
know, we understand his
situation. It's hard though.

110
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:40,340
Overall it's kind of like you have
to build a reputation of saying only

111
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:43,160
important things.
That's a good way w place to start.

112
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:47,870
Just be quiet and not only like exactly,
exactly what you said, that added thing,

113
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:50,120
which you kind of actually
may have already said,

114
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:52,430
but when you sit back and
just listened to them,

115
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:56,000
it'll cause you to have to say less
because what if you wanted to like,

116
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,740
oh I was going to make this point.

117
00:06:57,741 --> 00:06:59,870
That's the feeling you get when you
want to interrupt. Someone's like, oh,

118
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:00,360
I want to

119
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,060
wait right now, kind of thing. You will
find out. You just let people talk.

120
00:07:04,061 --> 00:07:06,500
You don't have to make that point.
They know this stuff already.

121
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,220
You know all that. And then you'll find
that that's probably a lot of the time,

122
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,170
you know, so, and by the way,

123
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,500
if I step in to make a point that people
already know how impactful is that

124
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:20,500
point,
it's very limited impact.

125
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,940
So the more points that you can hear
that you know and that everyone knows and

126
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:27,250
that you don't have to say
the better off you are.

127
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:30,910
So when you do make a point and it's
a point that no one really thought of,

128
00:07:30,911 --> 00:07:32,180
how impactful is that port?

129
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,450
The answer is it's very impactful and it
comes way more clear that it might be a

130
00:07:37,451 --> 00:07:40,810
point that no one thought of after you
listen to everyone and talk for however

131
00:07:40,811 --> 00:07:43,510
long. And then it's like, oh wait,
this wasn't covered so I can say this.

132
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,480
I don't have to say all these other
things are they going to interact with or

133
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:51,310
whatever. Yeah. Just be quiet, right?
Yes. Be Quiet. And in social situations,

134
00:07:51,311 --> 00:07:52,144
for example,
cool

135
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,670
to me. And this is what I kind of started
doing or tried to start doing in social

136
00:07:58,671 --> 00:07:59,181
situations.

137
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:02,420
You know how like a k I listened to
my wife and her friends talking there.

138
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:05,570
It's just a boom, boom interrupting
NRA. It's not rude or nothing.

139
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:08,210
It's just cause they're just talking and
yeah. And that's, that's how they roll.

140
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:08,630
Yes.

141
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:13,630
How they roll and to the point where I'm
getting like little mild micro doses of

142
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,580
anxiety because of all the
interruptions. Yeah. Yeah.

143
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:20,750
It's like they just talk a lot.
That's what it is. Um, anyway, so,

144
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,560
um, I found in social
situations if I feel that,

145
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:28,130
like if I'm like trying to talk or that
I'm getting interrupted a lot, a lot, man,

146
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,310
in a way, they don't really care
that much about what you have to say.

147
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:36,460
They have more like they care more
about what they have to say it,

148
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:38,900
it's a social situation. So yeah,
you might as well just be quiet.

149
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,010
You're adding less value,
interrupting their valuable stuff,

150
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,270
you know so sure would be quiet and you'll
find that they'll want to talk to you

151
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:49,310
more too if you'd be quiet
and not interrupt them.

152
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,450
You might have to take some heavies
on the interruption front though.

153
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,390
Cause that is kind of annoying if you
pay attention to it. That's what I think.

154
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,200
I see what you're doing.
And now next question.

155
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,510
I saw your Ted Talk.
I like most people have a boss.

156
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,430
If it wasn't the fault of the guys below
you and there are people above you,

157
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:13,890
shouldn't they take ownership, I. E.

158
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:18,891
Your commanding officer and then it in
turn his why would ownership only drift

159
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,003
halfway up.

160
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,320
So in an ideal world, ownership goes
up and down the chain of command.

161
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,813
Absolutely.

162
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And that is how problems get solved
because people take ownership of those

163
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,810
problems throughout the chain of command.

164
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:40,240
Now does the world always work like that?

165
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,370
No, it doesn't. And
that's okay. That's fine.

166
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:46,360
Because as the boss of what you're the
boss of, you can't make any excuses.

167
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,610
That's the way it happens.

168
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,020
And when an organization
is taking ownership,

169
00:09:53,021 --> 00:09:56,020
when you've got a team where everyone
is taking ownership on that team,

170
00:09:56,021 --> 00:10:01,021
there's absolutely overlap of everyone
taking responsibility for the different

171
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,960
problems. There'll be some overlap or I
could have done this to help out, oh yeah,

172
00:10:04,961 --> 00:10:08,650
and I would have done this better and
now we both solved the same problem.

173
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:09,484
But it's,

174
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,650
it's redundant but good because now
we've got two people addressing their

175
00:10:14,651 --> 00:10:16,180
problem.
So that's not a bad thing.

176
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,700
So when people are taking ownership
up and down the chain of command,

177
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:22,390
the problems are getting not just,
not just solved by one angle,

178
00:10:22,391 --> 00:10:26,020
but by multiple different angles of
everyone that's taking ownership of that

179
00:10:26,021 --> 00:10:26,854
problem.

180
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,540
When the blue on blue happened in
that I talked about extreme ownership,

181
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,600
that was in the Ted talk,
and I talk about this,

182
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:38,080
like my guys took ownership of
what they did wrong as well.

183
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:42,730
The guy that shot the, the
Iraqi soldier, the radium,

184
00:10:42,731 --> 00:10:46,330
and took ownership of the fact that
he didn't pass a word quick enough.

185
00:10:46,331 --> 00:10:49,780
The element leader took ownership of
the fact that the Iraqis had gotten away

186
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:53,620
from him.
They all owned their little pieces.

187
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,780
And of course I owned it as well.

188
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,350
And when I took ownership of everything,
it wasn't like those guys then said,

189
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,350
oh okay, well then I'm absolved and I
don't have to change anything. No, no, no.

190
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:09,970
Those guys still realized that they made
some mistakes and some things that they

191
00:11:09,971 --> 00:11:12,910
need to clean up.
So I took ownership of the same thing.

192
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:14,800
They were taking ownership and guess what?
Then again,

193
00:11:14,801 --> 00:11:17,740
it was a redundant that we were
all trying to solve the problems.

194
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,520
Now this is the opposite. This doesn't
happen when you start blaming people.

195
00:11:21,521 --> 00:11:24,130
Everyone makes excuses.
That's just the way it works.

196
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,100
So I think that that's what you have to
think about. So it was, so like I said,

197
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,770
ideally when a leader takes ownership,

198
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,160
so do the people up and
down the chain of command,

199
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,970
they also take ownership of the
problems that need. If they do,

200
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:44,440
that's great and the leader can then
monitor what those people up and down the

201
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:49,000
chain of command do to fix the problem.
And if they fix the problems,

202
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:53,830
then that's great. That's the way it
works. And if they don't fix the problems,

203
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,130
then that's when the leader has to own
it up and down the chain of command and

204
00:11:57,131 --> 00:12:00,490
still be responsible and take
ownership of fixing the problem.

205
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:06,990
So
the other piece of this,

206
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,280
I guess is that

207
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,920
that's why extreme ownership works.

208
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,340
It works because people that
don't take ownership, again,

209
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,670
up or down the chain of command,
they will be, they will,

210
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,250
they will end up being overrun

211
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,800
by the people that take ownership.
It might not happen immediately,

212
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:35,190
but eventually the people that make
excuses will be overrun by the people that

213
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:38,710
take ownership. That's the way it
works. And by the way, then I, again,

214
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:43,660
I talked about this in the Ted talk when
that whole thing happened and I took

215
00:12:43,661 --> 00:12:47,320
ownership of it, my boss then
trusted me more, not less.

216
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,880
And that's the way,
that's what happens.

217
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,720
You end up increasing your trust.
So,

218
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:02,760
so take ownership. If your boss
takes ownership too, that's awesome.

219
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,013
That's awesome.

220
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,560
That means you've got multiple
people trying to solve the problem,

221
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,600
which is good for the team.

222
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,590
You guys get asked this a lot.
For some reason life gets asked this a lot

223
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:16,963
where

224
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,680
it's a lot,

225
00:13:19,681 --> 00:13:23,010
a lot like almost every single time I see
life in a question answering situation.

226
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,110
He's, they say, what do I do?

227
00:13:25,111 --> 00:13:30,111
Or what happens when my boss isn't taking
over ownership or what do I do when my

228
00:13:30,211 --> 00:13:31,620
whatever isn't taking ownership.

229
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,270
The question is ultimately what do I do
when the other guy isn't taking on and

230
00:13:36,271 --> 00:13:36,750
shit.
Right.

231
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,990
And see how you're smiling right now
because like we all get so obvious,

232
00:13:39,991 --> 00:13:41,670
you know,
essentially that's what this is.

233
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,430
I mean he's not in the
scenario so it's not, you know,

234
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,160
but and how you guys always
say it's like big wall.

235
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,080
The thing is extreme ownership isn't about
the other guy taking ownership or not

236
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:56,370
taking on a ship. It's about everything
you can personally do to take ownership.

237
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,390
That's it. It stops right
there. No, just like you said,

238
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,810
if everyone else was taking ownership,

239
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:05,370
which will happen cause it's kind of this
weird contagious kind of thing. Yeah.

240
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,210
And, and I don't want to
throw it out there like, Oh,

241
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:09,000
if I take ownership then
everyone's automatically check on.

242
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:10,960
Is that doesn't happen cause
there'll be none of those that don't,

243
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,330
there's some people that are not
looking to take ownership. And again,

244
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:15,470
those are the people that will
eventually get overwhelmed. Yes.

245
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,820
Because who do you want working for you?
The guy that says,

246
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:19,060
well this wasn't my fault,
it wasn't,

247
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:22,060
but someone else do you want that guy
working for you because that person not

248
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,650
going to change.
They're going to do anything different.

249
00:14:23,651 --> 00:14:24,760
They're not going to
get that problem solved.

250
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,060
You want the person working for you that
says, you know what? This is my fault.

251
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:30,940
This is what I'm gonna do to fix
it. Here we go. Yeah, you go, okay,

252
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,870
well I'll let you continue
to do your job and,

253
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:35,170
and I want you to continue to do job.
And by the way,

254
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:37,480
when a promotion opportunity comes up,
guest who I'm promoting,

255
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,240
the guy that makes a bunch of excuses
and blames other people or the guy that

256
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:43,360
takes ownership and get his
problem solved, you, there
you go. It's a no brainer.

257
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,300
And I think as people see
that in an organization,

258
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:50,560
the majority of people now this,
I will say the majority of people,

259
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,370
they will also

260
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,340
take ownership. There will be a
minority of people that go, oh,

261
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,350
I'm going to slough off and I'm
going to keep blaming other people.

262
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,050
And in their minds they think they
look good. Right. In my mind when I go,

263
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:04,760
it was my fault. It was echo's fault.
I think I saved myself from the blame.

264
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,510
What I really did was look like an excuse
making little baby and I don't want to

265
00:15:08,511 --> 00:15:12,630
promote me because I knew it wasn't my
fault. Oh, the podcast and com I was ma,

266
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,370
it wasn't my fault as the echo's fault.
Yeah. Oh really? Okay, well let's,

267
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:19,250
let's think about that.
Do you want who's or who's responsible?

268
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,850
I'm shirking responsibility and
laying it on some other person.

269
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,530
I don't want that person working
for me. No. So that's why it works.

270
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,880
Yeah. And I was scared of it.
People are scared that, well,

271
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,160
I take the blame.
I'm going to look bad.

272
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:38,540
Don't you look bad when you don't take
the blame. That's when you look bad? Yeah,

273
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,210
pretty much.
Anytime in one way or another.

274
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:44,540
Pretty much anytime you look at other
people and be like, Hey, what about them?

275
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,540
You know, in this extreme
ownership situation like the,

276
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:51,470
it's like it goes against the very nature
is extreme ownership too. To ask like,

277
00:15:51,471 --> 00:15:55,070
Hey, what about them? Why didn't they
take responsibility? Just like, I mean,

278
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:55,661
back to the question,

279
00:15:55,661 --> 00:15:58,820
it's kind of like just to kind of get
a handle on understanding what extreme

280
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:03,320
ownership is. If you start to
incorporate, hey, what about them? Hey,

281
00:16:03,321 --> 00:16:06,560
what about the higher ups? Why should
the ownership stop at you? Well,

282
00:16:06,561 --> 00:16:10,970
here's the thing. It doesn't begin.
It begins and stops, stops at me.

283
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,870
That's 100% of what it is now.
Other people,

284
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:17,840
I mean if I can step out of my
own situation of extreme engine,

285
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,920
just kind of evaluate other people when
they see you or feel you or see you

286
00:16:21,921 --> 00:16:26,810
taking ownership of stuff.
I think it tends to be
contagious like no, absolutely.

287
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:29,870
That's what I just said. The majority
of people when you take ownership,

288
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,450
when I take ownership of something,
if I go echo, you know what,

289
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:34,460
this isn't my fault that the podcast
didn't come out and whatever,

290
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:38,090
this is my fault that we didn't get
this done. You're tendency isn't to go,

291
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,480
oh cool, it's [inaudible] fault. Yeah, I
agree with you two for no, and you'd go,

292
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:44,660
no man, I should've done this or I
should've done that. And now, once again,

293
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,200
we're both trying to solve the problem.
That's the way it usually ends up. Yeah.

294
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:53,930
Real interesting. How like, oh, Jamie,
I, you know, email with Jamie, Jamie,

295
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,430
Ashland Fun. Uh, and she'll like,
I'll make some mistake, you know,

296
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,510
on the spelling of something, on some
video on and know something and she'll,

297
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,480
she's real good at taking ownership and
she's like, aw, you know, I should've,

298
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,000
you know, whatever, whatever. And
to the point, sometimes it's like,

299
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:12,320
I see what you're doing. And it's true.
It's like any feeling of like, oh,

300
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,930
oh, I shouldn't, you know,
excuse making or whatever.

301
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,950
Any feeling of that gun when someone
is like, oh no, no, no, it's my fault.

302
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:21,110
I should have caught that. And what do
you mean you should have caught that?

303
00:17:21,111 --> 00:17:24,470
I should've caught that. I made the video
kind of thing kind of thing. But man,

304
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:26,720
it works.
So like it's real contagious.

305
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:30,420
I think even people who are just
naturally defensive, you know, you know,

306
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,640
cause people were different, you know?
I think over time they tend to be when,

307
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,950
when they kind of build this kind of,

308
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,490
when everyone builds a reputation of
not blaming, it's like they, they,

309
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,350
they let that natural guard down and they
look over time, you know, even if they,

310
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:49,650
at first they don't want to check.
Next question,

311
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,790
what are some ways to get out of a Rut?

312
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,080
In Jujitsu were just
talking about this off air.

313
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:03,150
I always get caught in the same spot,
cross side and can't move.

314
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,043
What should I do?

315
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,890
This is a brutal answer but the truth.
Sure.

316
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,110
If you have a hard time in a certain
position, start there every time.

317
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:18,360
Start with the person across the,
across the side until you get used to it.

318
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:23,010
And then on top of starting there and
you start working your techniques,

319
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,060
learn some new escapes. Cause whatever
you're doing right now isn't working.

320
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,370
So learn some new excuse escapes.

321
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,850
Now this doesn't mean that
you need to learn 47 escapes,

322
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,120
but if you've got your one go
to escape and it's not working,

323
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,210
does it actually there's a pretty good
chance if you only know one escape from

324
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:41,550
something, it's not gonna work
cause one escape. Then the guests,

325
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:44,490
what the person has to defend
one thing and so they stop it.

326
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,880
So learn,
you know,

327
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,340
three escapes total,

328
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,940
maybe four escapes total and these are
escapes that must be escaped that kind of

329
00:18:54,941 --> 00:18:57,570
chained together,
which most of the time they do.

330
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:01,170
So you learn and you know you can ask,
you can ask,

331
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:02,490
obviously you can ask your instructor,

332
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,460
you can ask some of the other
students that that you see get out.

333
00:19:05,461 --> 00:19:06,300
How did you do that?

334
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,200
You can even go look at Youtube and Google
Cross side escapes and get some good

335
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:11,034
ideas from there.

336
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,170
And then you're going to have to take
risks while you try your new escapes in.

337
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,370
You can drill them of course,

338
00:19:17,371 --> 00:19:21,090
but then eventually you're gonna have
to try and live because when you do

339
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:24,090
something in a drill is not the
same as doing it live it, it's,

340
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:27,720
there are adjustments that need to be
made and things that you need to figure

341
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:32,721
out and you're not going to be successful
the first hundred times or 50 times or

342
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,800
28 times or 420 times
that you try something.

343
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,430
There's a lot of little things you got
to figure out and you're going to get

344
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:42,750
caught in some of those times.

345
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,040
You're going to try something and
you're gonna get caught. So take risks

346
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,720
and try your escapes.
Another point,

347
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,450
and I've probably talked
about this before,

348
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,990
specifically cross side,

349
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,690
don't wait until the person settles
in before you started your escape.

350
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,640
And this is true with anything,
right? This is true with life.

351
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,700
Don't wait until your,
if you see a bad position coming,

352
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,260
don't wait until the position.

353
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,860
Don't wait until the bad thing
actually fully happens to, you know,

354
00:20:13,861 --> 00:20:16,280
start to defend it before
it settles in on you.

355
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,180
You get a bad scenario
coming down the line,

356
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,020
start to aggressively
counter that bad thing, what,

357
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:26,880
whatever it is before
it actually gets you.

358
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,890
And if you can do that,
then you will be,

359
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,400
I guarantee that that's,
that's a lot of the problem right there.

360
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:40,530
Cause cause cause getting out of a cross
side is a really hard position to get

361
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:41,341
out of it.
I don't care who you are.

362
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:45,300
I have a hard time when dean gets across
side on me and it is hard to get out.

363
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,940
Like I mean it, it's really
hard to get out. Yeah.

364
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,390
So what does that mean? Yeah.
That's a dominant position.

365
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,550
And that's the last thing is like you
have to take some risks to get out.

366
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,060
Sometimes you've got to break the rules
to get out. You got to do something.

367
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:06,190
You got to offer up a possible submission
to them that you know is coming.

368
00:21:06,191 --> 00:21:10,480
You know, there's some things
that you can do like that. But um,

369
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,320
escaping before the situation has
occurred to you is a very positive thing.

370
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,420
You could do that with anything like you.
You're in a relationship,

371
00:21:19,421 --> 00:21:20,620
you see something bad coming down,

372
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,780
you see a human being you're in a
relationship with and you see that the

373
00:21:25,781 --> 00:21:29,950
relationship is going in a bad direction.
If you try and either fix it or

374
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,640
end it before the thing goes sideways,
that's the smart thing to do.

375
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,040
Yeah,
don't wait until everything's a disaster.

376
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,730
You've got to go and get the
restraining order or whatever. Right?

377
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,660
You're calling the cops

378
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,860
because you've got someone
that's acting irrational.

379
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,080
Don't wait until that moment.

380
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,700
Solve the problem as early as
possible is the point. Yeah,

381
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,550
so that's how you get
out of that little rut.

382
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,810
Yeah. That's what you said in
the beginning of the start,

383
00:22:01,811 --> 00:22:05,540
in that bad situation that that's a huge,
and I don't,

384
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,000
I don't know if all academies do this,

385
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:10,960
but I mean Dean has always done this
where before you do open matter that live

386
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:11,590
rolling and whatever,

387
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:15,460
like right before that there was a
part where it's essentially situational

388
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,710
training. You know, you
go start side control,

389
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,080
we're going to go for two minutes or
a minute, half of whatever, a one,

390
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:24,100
nine in top and bottom obviously.
And if you get outreach.
Exactly right. Yeah. The,

391
00:22:24,101 --> 00:22:24,650
you know,
the guy,

392
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,950
the top guy is trying to submit the
bottom guy and the bottom guys trying to

393
00:22:26,951 --> 00:22:30,280
escape. If the bottom guy escapes,
you start all over. Yeah. That's it.

394
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:33,570
And the other point to that is if you get
submitted, doesn't count. Exactly. Right?

395
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,950
Yeah, of course. Yeah. I'm
trying new things. I'm taking
rest. So I expect you, I,

396
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,660
I actually expect that you're
going to get submitted. Yeah.

397
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,080
Because you're trying new things. If
you, in fact, if you don't get submitted,

398
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:47,080
you fail because you
didn't try something new.

399
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,550
Yeah. That's not what that drills for it.
And you can feel it too, you know, like,

400
00:22:52,551 --> 00:22:55,040
okay, sure the guy tapped me out.
You don't want them to tap you out,

401
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,230
but you're there to escape.
That's it. You know,

402
00:22:57,231 --> 00:23:01,910
so it's not about like winning this
match or losing this round or whatever.

403
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,450
You know, you're, and then you get so
familiar with being inside control.

404
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,980
So when you do go live
role, you're like, oh,

405
00:23:06,981 --> 00:23:09,950
I'm familiar because I've done this
situation with drill who full speed by

406
00:23:09,951 --> 00:23:11,780
though it's a full speed drill and yeah,

407
00:23:11,781 --> 00:23:15,140
you're just so familiar with
that position. So not only
are you more comfortable,

408
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,630
you know those different
escapes that you've learned,

409
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,720
you don't earlier that day or whatever.
Whenever you learn them and then,

410
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:24,830
then you can execute him way better. Get
comfortable being uncomfortable. Yeah.

411
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:28,340
But that helps them. That helps
so much those, those situational

412
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:34,610
sparring, straight holes.
Next question, Jocko.

413
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,020
There are no bad teams,
only bad leaders.

414
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,010
Do you think there are exceptions to this?
If so,

415
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,240
how do you know you're
apart of the exception?

416
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,280
That is a quote from the book,

417
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:54,080
extreme ownership written by myself and
my brother Leif Babin and it has a quote

418
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,980
that I don't want to say we stole,
but we stole.

419
00:23:57,981 --> 00:24:02,981
We appropriated from David
Hackworth who said there's no bad.

420
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,620
I think you said no bad officers,
no bad units,

421
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:11,000
only bad officers and Napoleon
who said there's no bad regiments,

422
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:15,110
only bad kernels. And we said there's
no bad teams, only bad leaders.

423
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,710
And the question is,
is there an exception to this?

424
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,730
And how do you know if you're part of
the exception? Well, actually there is.

425
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,760
There's a big exception to this and the
exception is that there are bad leaders

426
00:24:28,491 --> 00:24:32,330
with good teams. That is
true. That can happen.

427
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:36,980
Sometimes you get a bad leader that
is running a really, really good team.

428
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:39,390
So that's an exception to,
I guess it's an except from this world.

429
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,600
Maybe that's the way I took it.
Uh,

430
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:45,470
so you get a team that's so good
that they just continue to perform,

431
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,560
even though they have a horrible leader,

432
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:52,310
they perform despite their bad leader.
Gotcha.

433
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,400
Now what this doesn't,

434
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,640
this does not prove you don't,

435
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,560
I would say leadership is the
most important on the battlefield.

436
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,250
This doesn't disprove that statement.

437
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,580
You'd think maybe it does because oh well
you got a bad leader and you've got a

438
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:10,340
good team. Then maybe leadership
isn't that important. That's wrong.

439
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:15,580
Actually what it proves is that leadership
can come from any level inside the

440
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:16,941
organization.

441
00:25:16,941 --> 00:25:19,220
That's what improves and it proves that
because I've seen that over and over

442
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:21,440
again and when I was running the
training for the seal platoons,

443
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:28,300
eventually I didn't care where the
leadership in the platoon was because I

444
00:25:28,971 --> 00:25:30,530
realized that it was a real,

445
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:36,070
it was a real hard thing to hope for
that you had the person that was in the

446
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:42,791
leadership positions like
a platoon commander or the
platoon chief to to assume

447
00:25:45,621 --> 00:25:50,090
or to figure that they were going to be
the leader that you wanted them to be

448
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:54,050
was a big assumption to make. And so what
I realized after training for awhile,

449
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,590
it was like even though I wanted the
leaders to be those senior guys who were

450
00:25:57,591 --> 00:25:58,700
supposed to be taking leadership,

451
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,900
eventually I realized as I didn't
care where that leadership came from,

452
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,000
as long as there was a
couple of good leaders,

453
00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:08,960
you would end up with a good seal
platoon in a platoon would be on track.

454
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,560
Now, maybe the question is
what this person is hinting at,

455
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,510
the exception being, is there an
exception that if there is a bad team,

456
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:23,650
maybe that team is just so filled with
bad people that they can't get the job

457
00:26:23,651 --> 00:26:24,730
done it.
That's the kind of,

458
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:27,610
except he's talking about or
failing because the team is so bad,

459
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,030
even though the leader is good,
even though the leaders good,

460
00:26:31,031 --> 00:26:35,920
but the team is so bad that that's an
exception to the rule. Well, guess what?

461
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:38,803
Yeah,

462
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,020
who's responsible for
the people on the team?

463
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,690
Who's responsible training the people
on the team so that they can get good at

464
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:50,691
their job and they can perform
with excellence or who's
in charge of getting rid

465
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:55,920
of the people that are subpar so that the
team steps up their performance? Well,

466
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,930
they answered all those
questions is the leader.

467
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,980
So if you're on a bad team
and you're leading the team,

468
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,870
it's your fault and there's no
exceptions to that. Yeah. Zero.

469
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,720
Yeah. I'm over here trying to think of
the exception, but just what you said,

470
00:27:10,721 --> 00:27:13,480
it's like kind of,
yeah. Kind of negate it.

471
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,740
Hey this, this, let's take a real,

472
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:20,090
a real simple example of like
a sports team, right? Oh,

473
00:27:20,091 --> 00:27:24,650
this sports team got dealt a bad hand
and now the people on the team, well,

474
00:27:24,651 --> 00:27:27,640
what are you going to do? You're going
to train those people who's responsible?

475
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,780
I'm not saying you're going to
per start performing right now,

476
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:34,400
but you can get on the trajectory
will, you'll be good eventually. Now,

477
00:27:34,401 --> 00:27:36,140
if you just blame, hey, I got
a bad team, well guess what?

478
00:27:36,141 --> 00:27:37,190
Then you don't put an effort.
Guess what?

479
00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:40,520
You're going to continue to be a
loser of the exception. My teammate,

480
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:45,320
my team is just so bad.
Train your people.

481
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:49,520
I'm not saying you're a miracle worker.
I'm not saying you can.

482
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,260
You can take people that don't have
any skills and instantly through your

483
00:27:54,261 --> 00:27:56,930
leadership turned them
into incredible performers.

484
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,500
Know that that's not going to
happen, but guess what? As a leader,

485
00:28:00,501 --> 00:28:02,750
you've got and you bring people
into your team that are good. Go.

486
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,080
You do train the people that you do have
up to the best of their abilities and

487
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:08,750
the people that can't perform the way
they need to perform, you get rid of him.

488
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,020
Yeah.
That's it.

489
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:17,930
No real exceptions other than, yeah, you
can have a good team with bad leaders.

490
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,690
Yeah. If only because there's a good
leader somewhere in there. You know,

491
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:25,340
the exception thing, I think
it's healthy, in my opinion,

492
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:30,470
none of this and most other things where
if if I or we start thinking that we're

493
00:28:32,091 --> 00:28:35,720
the exception so we don't
have to put in like, I dunno,

494
00:28:35,721 --> 00:28:40,190
like the work or whatever. Not necessarily
work with the, you know, how like, okay,

495
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:43,550
we'll take this and no bad teams, only
bad leaders, leaders. Ah, you know,

496
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:46,610
if I say I might be the exception
to this because my team is so bad,

497
00:28:46,611 --> 00:28:48,380
it's kind of like just
finished using them yet. Right.

498
00:28:48,381 --> 00:28:50,390
You kind of did a little
cop out there kind of thing.

499
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,330
It bottom line is if you don't
take ownership of what's going on,

500
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:58,460
then you're not going to perform well.
If you just blame your genetics,

501
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,991
then that means,
okay,

502
00:28:59,991 --> 00:29:02,960
well then I'm not going to get any kind
of shape whatsoever. Then guess what?

503
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:07,680
Guess what kind of shape you're being
junk, substandard, substandard. Yup.

504
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Jocko leadership is knowing when to cut
someone loose that can't perform in a

505
00:29:17,141 --> 00:29:17,974
team.

506
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:22,810
But do you have any techniques for trying
to help people who lack common sense

507
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:27,070
get better in the name of just trying
to make the world a better place?

508
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,690
Obviously without being a jerk.

509
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,890
My, my common answer in situations
like this and you've heard it before,

510
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,280
is to pick, put them in
charge of something, right?
You've got someone that's,

511
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,230
that's doesn't have a lot of common sense.

512
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:44,500
Pick something that's maybe just outside
their level of competency and put them

513
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:45,334
in charge of it.

514
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,410
Something that doesn't
put too much at risk.

515
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,950
So you can give them some room to make
some decisions and some mistakes without

516
00:29:53,951 --> 00:29:54,910
doing too much damage.

517
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,320
And then you coach them,

518
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,600
you monitor them and you coach them

519
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,420
and you,

520
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:08,510
you coach them not just
on what decision to make,

521
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,920
but more important how
to make that decision.

522
00:30:12,921 --> 00:30:17,750
So if you think about what common
sense is, if you break it down, right,

523
00:30:17,751 --> 00:30:21,430
if you break down what common sense is
common says he's like a blanket term that

524
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:23,750
we don't really relate it
to what it really means,

525
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:29,830
but it's a blanket term that covers a
person's sort of natural ability to make

526
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:35,480
good decisions. That's what, that's what
common sense essentially is. Sure. Right?

527
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,590
Because you don't look at someone,

528
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:39,920
someone makes a bad decision and you
say that person has no common sense.

529
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,890
Someone makes a good decision or
continually makes good decisions.

530
00:30:42,891 --> 00:30:45,230
Going back to that person's got
a lot of a lot of common sense.

531
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,200
So what we're really talking about
is their ability to make decisions.

532
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,123
Hmm.

533
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,790
So when you're trying to help
someone increased their common sense,

534
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:59,540
what you're really trying to do is
improve their decision making process.

535
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:03,350
So some things to look at when it
comes to improving your decision making

536
00:31:03,351 --> 00:31:07,780
process. Number One, learn how
to step back and detach. That's,

537
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,690
that's number one.

538
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:14,000
You can't make good decisions when you're
all embroiled in the, in the gun fight.

539
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:20,110
Learn how to analyze and assess and
create different courses of action.

540
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:27,560
Some people only see you one way and
when you only see one way and you can't

541
00:31:27,561 --> 00:31:28,011
detach,

542
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,920
you never opened up your mind to see
that there could possibly be other ways.

543
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:37,870
You have to in order to have good
common sense slash make good decisions.

544
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:43,390
You have to understand how to look at
and understand what the consequences of

545
00:31:47,421 --> 00:31:52,421
your actions are going to be and that
includes second and third order effects

546
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:53,570
because a lot of times when people,

547
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:56,810
oh that guy has no common sense cause
they do something that to them make sense

548
00:31:56,811 --> 00:31:58,880
at that moment they don't understand
what the consequences are.

549
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,970
They don't understand the second third
order affects and so it ends up being a

550
00:32:01,971 --> 00:32:04,760
bad decision and we just throw out like,
oh that guy's got no common sense

551
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,040
to make a good decision.
You have to know how to mitigate risk.

552
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,700
That's also very important
to make a good decision.

553
00:32:13,701 --> 00:32:18,320
You have to understand what your assets
are and what kind of resources you have.

554
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:22,700
Even on a simple decision,
even on a quote,

555
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,030
common sense decision,

556
00:32:24,031 --> 00:32:29,031
you have to understand what you have
at hand to help you execute whatever

557
00:32:29,391 --> 00:32:32,660
decision you make. You have to, this
is a big one, you have to learn.

558
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:33,830
If you want to make good decisions,

559
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:39,940
you have to understand that you're going
to make assumptions and you have to

560
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:45,910
analyze those assumptions and see which
ones make sense to make and which ones

561
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:51,290
are not sensible to make cause obviously,
and there's that old,

562
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,180
there's that old saying about assumptions.

563
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:55,640
Don't assume because it makes
an ass out of you and me.

564
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,130
That's a pretty realistic saying.

565
00:32:58,131 --> 00:33:01,250
It's a pretty good saying to keep
in the back of your mind if you make

566
00:33:01,251 --> 00:33:04,250
assumptions on things.
However, that being said,

567
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,260
if you make no assumptions,

568
00:33:06,261 --> 00:33:09,680
well then you can never move forward on
most things because you got assume like,

569
00:33:09,681 --> 00:33:09,891
okay,

570
00:33:09,891 --> 00:33:12,470
most of the time this is probably what's
going to happen and you can go forward

571
00:33:12,471 --> 00:33:16,260
with that. So let's go. You know,

572
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:19,870
the list goes on and and
in on.

573
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,530
And what you need to do is as you
give these people a little bit of

574
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:29,080
room and a little bit of responsibility
and a little bit of decision making in

575
00:33:29,081 --> 00:33:30,760
their life like you could
do with your kids, right?

576
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,390
You give your kids the opportunity
to make a decision and,

577
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:39,450
and if they make a bad decision and
all you do is smack them do without

578
00:33:40,661 --> 00:33:43,690
explaining to them the process,
the decision making process,

579
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,610
which is where that decision came from,

580
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,310
then they're never going to gain more
common sense. And you know, when you,

581
00:33:51,311 --> 00:33:52,540
when you think about the list,

582
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,910
I think detachment is actually
the most important thing.

583
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:59,830
And I think what happens to people that
don't have common sense, they, they,

584
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:05,310
they actually don't have the ability
at that time because they haven't been

585
00:34:05,621 --> 00:34:09,490
trained properly to see things
from an outside perspective. Yeah.

586
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,570
Have you ever noticed when somebody does
something that's completely lack the

587
00:34:13,571 --> 00:34:17,440
complete lack of common sense
when you raise the point to them,

588
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:22,470
they're always kind of like astonished
that like they don't even get why what

589
00:34:23,891 --> 00:34:25,900
they did was dumb.

590
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:30,520
They just think that that's just how
it was going to be and they don't even

591
00:34:30,521 --> 00:34:32,470
understand that what they did was dumb.
Yeah,

592
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:35,260
and sometimes you have to actually
explain to people that they're so,

593
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,350
they're so embedded in their
decision making process,

594
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,920
they can't see it from an
external perspective so they
don't even understand how

595
00:34:41,921 --> 00:34:43,320
dumb their decision was.
Yeah.

596
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:47,350
If you can get them some
level of detachment,

597
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,680
then you're moving them
in the right direction.

598
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,750
You're improving their
common sense and yes,

599
00:34:52,751 --> 00:34:57,400
when you're doing that to your credit you
are actually making the world a better

600
00:34:57,401 --> 00:34:58,234
place

601
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,290
and you kind of said this, they knew
it, but you give them experience.

602
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,680
You know like when you let them like
make sure decisions again because really

603
00:35:07,681 --> 00:35:11,430
that's really what common sense is, right?
If you have or don't have common sense,

604
00:35:11,431 --> 00:35:13,410
it's like if you have a lot of experience,

605
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,860
common sense is like you're a little bit
more in touch with it than someone with

606
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:20,100
very little experience. So let's say,
I mean it's culturally we'll say.

607
00:35:20,101 --> 00:35:22,590
So in Hawaii I went takes off their
shoes when they go in the house.

608
00:35:22,591 --> 00:35:26,400
This is just how, and uh, you know,
in the mainland it's not like that.

609
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:30,720
So if I've never been to Hawaii, I've
no experience in Hawaii, but you know,

610
00:35:30,721 --> 00:35:32,550
in the, in the, I live in
the mainland the whole time.

611
00:35:32,551 --> 00:35:36,540
But if I don't have any access to the
Hawaii culture, whatever, I go to Hawaii,

612
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,800
I'm going leave my shoes on.

613
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,390
You know, it's like common sense, man,

614
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:44,760
you take off your shoes if you've only
lived in Hawaii the whole time right now.

615
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:50,280
So you could argue, hey, all you
gotta do is look around and see.

616
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,510
But I don't,

617
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,690
I'm not trained to look around to see
what everyone's wearing it not wearing,

618
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,910
you know, like bell. So that's
weird. Do you ever notice it?

619
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,060
I would say once a month at the gym,

620
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:05,270
someone walks on the mat with Jews on
like just not even when it's literally

621
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:10,360
stepping over a big pile or line of shoes
of flip flops and choose to get on the

622
00:36:11,911 --> 00:36:13,350
map and they're just no factor.

623
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:17,040
They're just stepping over with their
street shoes on. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

624
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:20,970
That's the exact, you would think
common sense would tell you, hey,

625
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,880
it looks like every single person,
there's 28 people on the Mat.

626
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,910
None of them are wearing shoes,
and I'm stepping over. You'd think,

627
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,970
but that's a person that doesn't
have common sense. Right.

628
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:31,110
So what you have to do
with a person like that,

629
00:36:31,111 --> 00:36:32,880
and when you see someone that
does that kind of thing, you know,

630
00:36:32,881 --> 00:36:36,390
let's say your kid did that, you'd
say, hey, instead of just going, hey,

631
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:39,810
take off your shoes. You know, you
go, hey, before you do something,

632
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,130
look around at the environment. Take
a look around. What do you see? Yeah.

633
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,890
You see all these people on the mat and
none of them wearing shoes and you look

634
00:36:46,891 --> 00:36:50,520
right in front of your feet and there's
all these shoes off the mat that

635
00:36:50,521 --> 00:36:53,970
probably indicates that you
should take off your shoes.

636
00:36:53,971 --> 00:36:55,980
That should be a good
decision. It should be, but,

637
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:59,580
and the but now you're going into yet
another different type of experience.

638
00:36:59,581 --> 00:37:04,260
Like if you're in in scenarios often
where you were looking around and seeing

639
00:37:04,261 --> 00:37:06,900
what other people are doing and
wearing like and all this stuff.

640
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,230
If you're constantly in situations
in situations like that,

641
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:14,850
that will become more part of your
common sense. Right. So it's like to say,

642
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,470
I mean there are plenty
of people who in Britain,

643
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,950
normal everyday life
have normal common sense.

644
00:37:19,951 --> 00:37:22,770
Like everyone else who
would wear shoes on the mat,

645
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:26,910
they just simply would cause they don't,
hey these guys are training,

646
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:29,040
they're not going to wear
shoes while they're training.

647
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:30,660
So they took off their shoes.
I'm not training,

648
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,490
I'm just going to go talk
to this guy over here. Boom.

649
00:37:32,491 --> 00:37:35,310
I'm rolling with the shoes on the mat.
Just like, oh, I've never been away.

650
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,210
You know I'm going to go into this house
there. They live here. They didn't.

651
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,540
Maybe he just got out of bed.

652
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:41,970
Maybe they just want to be comfortable
because they got out of work.

653
00:37:41,971 --> 00:37:42,691
I don't know.

654
00:37:42,691 --> 00:37:45,690
I don't if it doesn't go through the
thought process of my common sense,

655
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:50,550
common sense is if I don't have to take
off my shoes for something specific I'm

656
00:37:50,551 --> 00:37:54,330
not going to do it. That's
just how, that's just my
comment, experience, you know?

657
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,060
So the common sense is kind
of a situational thing.

658
00:37:57,061 --> 00:38:00,210
You know it's not just cut and dry.
He has commonsense versus not.

659
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:05,130
So you put them in more experience
that's common to the group. Oh Man.

660
00:38:05,131 --> 00:38:09,990
It's common sense goes up. Fair
enough. I think so. I think so.

661
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,570
Next question.

662
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:17,220
I have been told by employees
that I'm cold and non engaging.

663
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:22,530
My peers say I charge hell with a bucket
of water and sometimes get to stop or

664
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,660
sometimes forget to stop
and fill the bucket.

665
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,200
In military training we all went through
the mental part and in battle some

666
00:38:30,451 --> 00:38:33,690
won't engage properly.
I treat my business the same,

667
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,280
the same way as I fought in a firefight

668
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,940
and my mind was clear, focused on the
objective and being aggressive. Always.

669
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,310
Why should my business be any different?

670
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:47,500
Delegate and don't quit until you
accomplish the goal. Is this wrong?

671
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:55,210
So let's start with
cold and non unengaging.

672
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:01,990
I get that people have different levels
of emotional responsiveness. I get that.

673
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:07,260
I'm probably a little bit on the low
end of that in terms of being super

674
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:10,180
emotionally responsive.
Agree.

675
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,970
I don't really get mad.

676
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,560
I don't usually get frustrated,

677
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:23,710
but at the same time as a leader,
you have to show some emotion.

678
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:27,250
If you show no emotion at all, then
you're on a person. You're a robot,

679
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:30,490
and robots don't really
connect with people.

680
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:34,180
And so you don't forming
new relationships.

681
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:39,160
And if you don't form good relationships,

682
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:44,190
you're not going to have a good
leadership connection with your team.

683
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:49,160
That's the way it is. So you
got to show some emotions. You,

684
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:53,440
you don't need to get all
wild. And in fact, as a leader,

685
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:57,700
your emotions should be controlled.
They should be. You know,

686
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,760
if a normal person's emotions go from
a one to 10 a leader should be like,

687
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:06,160
you know, at three, maybe four.
And he shouldn't go beyond that.

688
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,290
And I've talked about this
before. If, if someone,

689
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,630
if my team's getting all
emotional and I'm just all cold,

690
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:14,980
I actually disconnect from my team and
all of a sudden they're looking at me

691
00:40:14,981 --> 00:40:19,960
like I'm not one of them. Yeah, yeah. It
doesn't even care. Same thing with your,

692
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,460
with your spouse,

693
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:24,940
if you or your spouse's all mad
about something and you're like, hey,

694
00:40:24,941 --> 00:40:27,580
just calm down, that's going
to be a problem. You have to,

695
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:30,730
you have to give them some emotions back.
So

696
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:37,100
show some emotions. As a leader,
you might even have to, you know,

697
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:41,850
manufacturing that just a little bit
too to let them see that you care.

698
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,790
You've got to do that with
your kids sometimes, you know,

699
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:47,730
because your kid is doing something
that you know they shouldn't be doing,

700
00:40:47,731 --> 00:40:50,600
but it's kind of funny and
it's hard to get mad at you,

701
00:40:50,601 --> 00:40:54,880
but you realize if you don't get mad
and this, this behavior escalates. Yeah.

702
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,190
Then that's problematic.

703
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,920
Like are you kind of fired up
when your kid does something,

704
00:40:58,921 --> 00:41:02,580
climbs up on a wall and is balancing,
you know, eight feet in the air? Well,

705
00:41:02,581 --> 00:41:04,440
if they fall and crack their head,
that's gonna be a problem. Yeah.

706
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,210
It at the same time you
think it's kind of cool,

707
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:11,120
but you have to reinforce safety.
Yeah.

708
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:16,200
And so you got to be like a little
bit angry at them, right? Hey, hey,

709
00:41:16,201 --> 00:41:18,930
I told you not to do the right kid
running in the road or whatever.

710
00:41:18,931 --> 00:41:21,860
You gotta you gotta reinforce
stuff. So it's, uh, you,

711
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:26,100
you actually have to show
some level of emotions. Now,

712
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:31,190
as far as the other part of the question
is aggression and never quitting.

713
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,420
Is that wrong? Well,
you know, quite frankly,

714
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,253
yes.

715
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,840
Yes. It can be very wrong. Of course,

716
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:51,820
much of what the statement is.
It makes sense,

717
00:41:51,821 --> 00:41:54,160
right? Be Aggressive. Don't
quit. Focus on the objective.

718
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:57,700
Charge into hell with a vengeance.
Right? We all like to hear that. Right.

719
00:41:57,701 --> 00:41:59,380
That reflects a great attitude.

720
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:05,710
I think everyone would expect me and
they would actually hear me say those

721
00:42:05,711 --> 00:42:07,960
things the same exact thing.
They want to be aggressive.

722
00:42:07,961 --> 00:42:08,830
We're never going to quit.

723
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,770
We're going to take that objective no
matter what you would hear me say that,

724
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:18,440
but at the same time we have to
remember that there are dichotomies in

725
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,460
leadership,
right?

726
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,220
And taking what is a normally what is
normally a good attitude to an absolute

727
00:42:25,221 --> 00:42:27,590
extreme without any balance at all.

728
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:30,710
That will turn into a problem.

729
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:36,530
So it sounds like this
individual is aggressive,
which is a very positive trait,

730
00:42:36,531 --> 00:42:41,090
but it sounds like perhaps there are
times when this individual might be too

731
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:41,780
aggressive.

732
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:45,890
Now most people don't want to hear that
and then they don't think they're going

733
00:42:45,891 --> 00:42:47,240
to hear that for me.
Right.

734
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:49,670
You almost think when somebody
asks me a question like this,

735
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:52,220
you almost think in their back
of their mind they're going,

736
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,980
you know what Jack was going to tell me
and I'm going to go even harder. Yeah.

737
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,133
Right.

738
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:01,820
Reinforcement from Jocko about
how being aggressive is awesome,

739
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:05,540
but here's the reality. And especially
if you throw like the firefight thing,

740
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,810
like Jack was definitely gonna be on
board with me now. But guess what?

741
00:43:08,811 --> 00:43:09,530
Here's the reality.

742
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:13,550
If you're in a firefight and the enemy
is in an elevated bunker to position

743
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,810
across open ground and you just
keep attacking it with your platoon,

744
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,420
what's going to happen?
I'll tell you what's going to happen.

745
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,030
You're all going to die.
That's what's going to happen.

746
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:29,950
So you're all fired up, you're all
aggressive, you're never going to quit,

747
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,620
and you're all going to die.
Does that help us?

748
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:37,660
Does that help us achieve our overall
strategic objective? The answer is no.

749
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,090
If you pull back for a minute,

750
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:45,250
if you detach from a moment mentally
and possibly physically as well,

751
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:49,240
you will likely see that
there's a better approach. Oh,

752
00:43:49,241 --> 00:43:53,170
how about we call for fire support? Hmm?
How would we put down some cupboard,

753
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,070
lay down some suppressive fire and move
around to the flank of the bunkered

754
00:43:57,071 --> 00:43:57,660
position?

755
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:02,660
There's a bunch of different ways that
you can get this done in a much more

756
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:07,360
survivable way. Hmm. But the fact is,

757
00:44:07,361 --> 00:44:12,361
if you're always aggressive and your
mindset is I am not going to quit,

758
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:16,720
then you won't see those other solutions
and yes, that is problematic. Yes,

759
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:19,690
that is wrong. And it's the same
thing in dealing with people.

760
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,720
If,
if

761
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:28,230
people don't respond to your leadership
and your reaction to that is just to get

762
00:44:28,811 --> 00:44:32,980
more and more aggressive with them.
Okay. They aren't likely to come around.

763
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,593
In fact,

764
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:38,380
they are likely to either become
hostile towards you because you're being

765
00:44:38,381 --> 00:44:42,640
aggressive towards them or the break.
Yeah.

766
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:47,080
Which each one of those is
problematic. Bad, bad results.

767
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:50,140
Either my team becomes hostile
towards me or I break my team.

768
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,000
Either way it's bad.

769
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,860
So being aggressive all
the time, no, not good.

770
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:01,090
And same thing. Same thing. Could
be like I default aggressive. Right?

771
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:06,010
I literally teach people to be that way,
but if you go too far with it,

772
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:11,920
you'll end up in a bad situation. Same
thing with don't quit. Right. Of course.

773
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,430
Of course. Don't quit. Great attitudes
might attitudes. I'm never going to quit.

774
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:19,540
I want everyone on my team to have
that attitude. I have that attitude.

775
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:25,180
That's like the, the [inaudible]
in the seal teams. Don't quit,

776
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:29,470
never quit.
But you have to be very,

777
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:33,280
very careful that you don't confuse,

778
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:34,623
don't quit

779
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:37,403
with,

780
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,560
don't try any other solutions or don't
deviate from the original plan no matter

781
00:45:42,561 --> 00:45:44,390
what. Yeah, yeah. Hey, I'm not quitting.

782
00:45:44,391 --> 00:45:46,070
I'm just gonna keep doing the
same thing over and over again.

783
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:49,560
I'm going to keep going forward at the
same plan. The plan isn't working. Yeah.

784
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,770
Okay. But I'm not a quitter. I'm
just gonna keep doing the same plant.

785
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,860
That's not good.
That's not good.

786
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:59,210
Don't quit means you don't give up.
It actually don't.

787
00:45:59,211 --> 00:46:03,740
Quit actually means try different
solutions. If one of them isn't working,

788
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:06,230
don't quit means keep an open mind.

789
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:10,760
Don't quit means you don't quit thinking.

790
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:16,510
Don't think, don't quit
thinking and then don't quit me.

791
00:46:16,511 --> 00:46:21,110
And to continue to keep thinking and
keep addressing a problem and keep

792
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,540
attacking the problem until
you do accomplish the mission.

793
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:27,140
But you do that through
multiple different avenues,

794
00:46:27,141 --> 00:46:29,780
not the same avenue the whole time.

795
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:35,080
That's how you lead.
That's how you get aggressive.

796
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:40,060
That's how you actually never quit.
And by the way, that is how you,

797
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:41,683
when,

798
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,820
yeah, that morale thing. Remember you
were talking about morale actually

799
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:55,890
where you know how like some
bosses it'll be like, hey,

800
00:46:55,891 --> 00:47:00,630
I'm not here to make you feel good or
I'm not here to make friends or whatever.

801
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,010
You know,
and sometimes like behavior or whatever,

802
00:47:05,011 --> 00:47:08,250
thinking like that can lead to behave
with that makes people not want to work

803
00:47:08,251 --> 00:47:12,960
for you or not feel good about the job.
Like I'm not happy about it.

804
00:47:12,961 --> 00:47:16,560
What's the use of making someone do the
job if they don't feel good about doing

805
00:47:16,561 --> 00:47:20,160
it? You don't like to let the morale
is down. I used to think a wall morale.

806
00:47:20,161 --> 00:47:23,250
Like people need to just toughen up.
You know, like freaking morality. You,

807
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,700
you don't just not do something just
because you're not feeling good that day

808
00:47:26,701 --> 00:47:29,470
kind of kind of thing. I
thought that too, but man,

809
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:33,540
if you have a group of people who
they all don't want to do it by,

810
00:47:33,541 --> 00:47:36,170
they're not going to do it. It's problem.
At the end of the day they're going to

811
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,800
do it. Well, they might do that.
One thing that day. Yeah. I mean,

812
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,560
every time you can break down for sure.
Yeah.

813
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,980
You're not leading them in the
in the right direction. Yeah.

814
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:49,530
You can look forcing people to do things
when you're in a position of authority,

815
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:52,950
you can do that. Yeah. That works.
That's functional. That's a thing.

816
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:55,470
It'll work a little bit. Yeah. Right.

817
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:59,610
But over time will you end up with a team
that really will perform well and will

818
00:47:59,611 --> 00:48:02,580
continue to drive when they
hit obstacles? No, you won't.

819
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:07,260
You'll end up with a team that's doing
what they're being told to do out of fear,

820
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:13,110
and that team is going to get beat by
the team that is doing it because they

821
00:48:13,111 --> 00:48:14,010
want to do it.

822
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:19,220
Yeah. Yeah. So if it's
like, you know, the guy who,

823
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:24,170
you know, they, I don't think that
my boss cares about me. In fact,

824
00:48:24,171 --> 00:48:27,140
I think that he kind of doesn't
care about me. That's what I think.

825
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:31,060
You're not going to do a lot of
extra effort to support your boss.

826
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:33,650
I'm sure we'll want to.
Next question, Jocko,

827
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,420
do you talk about bill or you talk about
building relationships a lot at work,

828
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:43,660
even when people whom you might not
like even with people who mean you don't

829
00:48:43,911 --> 00:48:48,260
like, have you always been this
way or did you also feel difficult?

830
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:54,250
Also feel difficulty in wanting to
build relationships with those people?

831
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:55,810
If the ladder,

832
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:00,310
what are the things that help you to
actually want to build relationships with

833
00:49:00,311 --> 00:49:01,144
them?

834
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:06,540
So,
or when I was a young seal,

835
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,710
I was pretty typical young seal,

836
00:49:10,711 --> 00:49:14,820
pretty typical young man. Sure.
Meaning I thought I was invincible.

837
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:20,340
I thought I could beat everyone in a
fight because I didn't know Jujitsu.

838
00:49:20,341 --> 00:49:22,500
So you just think you're just
going to win but that you're wrong.

839
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,050
I thought I knew everything,
of course,

840
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:30,180
and I thought I was smarter than
everyone else. Kinda typical.

841
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:33,750
Sometimes I would rub people the wrong way

842
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:39,010
and the people that I would rub the
wrong way where especially people that I

843
00:49:39,011 --> 00:49:42,460
thought thought we're not squared
away in the chain of command.

844
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:43,690
So if you weren't square,
if you,

845
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:46,190
if you were my boss and I didn't
think you were squared away. Yeah,

846
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,090
I was going to rub you the wrong way
because I was going to be slightly

847
00:49:49,091 --> 00:49:52,980
offensive. As a matter of
fact, I got an evaluation.

848
00:49:52,981 --> 00:49:55,930
It's one of the first evaluations
that I got when I got to a seal team.

849
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,590
And back in the day, yeah, you'd get,

850
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:03,700
you were rated 4.0 was the highest you
could get and it would go all the way

851
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:05,770
down to whatever like one.

852
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:10,600
But at this time they basically, everyone
got four o and everything, right?

853
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:14,830
You basically got four o and everything
and like you'd have to mess up,

854
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:16,890
you have to mess up to get
deviate from the forest.

855
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:21,890
So I got all four o's and I got a 3.8
which was like a major dig and the dig was

856
00:50:25,841 --> 00:50:30,650
in, I think it was like in relation,
like I don't know what the word was,

857
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:32,330
but when I got debriefed on it,

858
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:37,640
what the guy that gave me the three
eight mm. What he, what he told me,

859
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:43,550
which I actually was proud of. Cause
that's how stupid I was. He's like, you,

860
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:46,790
you're, you're too hostile with
people that aren't squared away.

861
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,290
That's literally what he told
me. He figured it out and
I was all like, whatever,

862
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:54,890
you're damn right. Damn hostile towards
people that aren't squared away.

863
00:50:54,891 --> 00:50:58,850
I'm going to go to war. Right.
Just an idiot. That's what,

864
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,720
that's what the situation
was. And you know,

865
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:08,780
it made me mad if a leader was weak
and I would form these antagonistic

866
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,780
relationships with leaders if
I thought that they were weak

867
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:17,780
and one of these bosses eventually that
I fought, I was better than [inaudible].

868
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:23,210
Right. I thought I was smarter,
thought I was smarter than him.

869
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,190
Right.
I thought that he was an idiot.

870
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:31,910
I should have his job right. How
often do you think that, right,

871
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:35,030
I should have that guy's job.
I'm, yeah, I'm smarter than them.

872
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:39,620
And the more I showed this attitude, the
worst our relationship got an a low end,

873
00:51:39,621 --> 00:51:44,621
the less he listened to me and the less
influence I had over how we did things.

874
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:52,440
And therefore the, the worst
we did. And the end, the,

875
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,061
the worse.

876
00:51:53,061 --> 00:51:57,950
Our ability to perform God because he
was just doing things the way he fought

877
00:51:57,951 --> 00:52:01,580
without any good input from anyone
below him in the chain of command.

878
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:07,090
All because I had formed this
antagonistic relationship with them,

879
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:10,660
which was bad because then he's not
listening to me. And then one day,

880
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:15,520
one day,
I said to myself,

881
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,090
if I'm so smart,

882
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:24,480
if I'm such a smart guy,
why am I losing? Hmm?

883
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:27,403
Why am I losing?

884
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:28,900
Okay

885
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,210
if I'm so smart,
if I am so smart,

886
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:35,530
why can't I get this guy to
do what I want him to do?

887
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,520
Even though he's my boss?
It doesn't matter if I'm so smart,

888
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:44,250
much smarter than him. Why can't I get
him to do what I want them to do? Mm hmm.

889
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,530
Why?
If I'm so smart,

890
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:52,180
how come I can't have more influence over
the way we operate if I'm so smart and

891
00:52:52,181 --> 00:52:55,890
he's so dumb.
And that's,

892
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,850
that's when I realized that
that's when I had an awakening,

893
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:05,250
an awakening that instead of
blaming him for being stupid,

894
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,660
I was the one who was being stupid.

895
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:16,060
I had lost the ability to influence
my boss because I was being stupid and

896
00:53:18,621 --> 00:53:21,980
because of my ego,
I literally thought I deserved his job.

897
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:25,770
That'd be I fought pretty much anyone
could, should anyone in the staff his job.

898
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:32,030
And therefore,
since I thought that I,

899
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:37,370
I undermine him instead of supporting
him instead of building a relationship

900
00:53:37,371 --> 00:53:39,410
with them, I undermined them. Now,

901
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,980
once I got humble

902
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:48,000
and I started to build a positive
relationship with them instead of an

903
00:53:48,001 --> 00:53:52,980
antagonistic one, that started
to change. And because,

904
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,300
because then he started listening to me,

905
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,200
he started to change some things and
my influence over the whole situation

906
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:04,330
became better because I now had a
relationship despite the fact that I,

907
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:07,290
I like the guy.
Despite that fact,

908
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:12,000
I built the relationship and the situation
got better. I had more influence.

909
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:17,770
And that became kind of my standard
operating procedure was to build

910
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:21,190
relationships with people.
Even if I didn't like them,

911
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:25,360
to build relationships with people
so that I could have more influence.

912
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:28,210
Now does what does that sound like?
Right.

913
00:54:28,211 --> 00:54:32,860
That sounds like I'm kind of this
manipulative to face, superficial,

914
00:54:32,861 --> 00:54:37,210
disingenuous guy that's,
that's being devious and conniving.

915
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:39,790
Not keeping it real, not
keeping it real. Right,

916
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:45,670
but the fact is that is not
true. That's not, that's not,

917
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,460
that's not who I am.
You don't know who I am.

918
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,280
I'm a guy that's trying to accomplish
the mission. That's what I am.

919
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,970
I'm a guy that is trying
to accomplish the mission.

920
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:02,590
Who is putting my own ego in check to
build a relationship with someone that I

921
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:06,460
don't like, that I don't respect,
but what I'm trying to do is

922
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:14,140
improve our operational capability.
That's what's more important to me.

923
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:19,960
Trying to arrange the situation,

924
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:25,330
build the relationship so that we do
better. Not so that I get promoted,

925
00:55:25,331 --> 00:55:30,070
not so that I'm getting some accolades,
but so that we as a team

926
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:32,493
do a better job.

927
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:38,640
Put the little feelings aside
because I want the team to win.

928
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:44,810
So if you're having, having some
trouble getting over your feelings

929
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:49,460
and getting over your ego to build
relationships for the good of the team,

930
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,740
ask yourself the same question
I asked myself a long time ago,

931
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:59,000
which is this,
if I am so smart,

932
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:02,730
why am I not winning?

933
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:08,490
And if you answer that question honestly,
then you'll put your ego in check.

934
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:13,340
You'll go build the relationships that
will make you and your team accomplished

935
00:56:13,341 --> 00:56:14,400
the mission.
And when

936
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:17,583
there you go,

937
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,930
can't help but agree with that one.

938
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:24,970
You know what?

939
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:27,880
You know what's funny is when you think
about like why you wouldn't like someone,

940
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:32,050
what, what causes you to not
like someone? Most of the time,

941
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:36,910
that's your ego anyways. Most of the
time. That's your ego anyways. Yeah.

942
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:41,370
And, and so, you know,
you had that story of the,

943
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:44,850
you know, you were consulting
somebody. It was like a big seal,

944
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:46,330
like a Lacrosse guy.

945
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:51,580
That story is probably the
most common story. I mean,

946
00:56:51,581 --> 00:56:52,720
the way you handle it different.
Yeah.

947
00:56:52,721 --> 00:56:56,560
But that scenario that you started with
with Esther soul common men where yeah,

948
00:56:56,561 --> 00:56:59,290
they rubbed you the wrong way because
right off the bat you see him as some kind

949
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:03,280
of competitive figure to
you. Like they're, you know,
some, you know, competitive,

950
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,700
you're competing with them in your
own mind in whatever, and few things,

951
00:57:06,701 --> 00:57:08,950
probably mutual a lot of the time, you
know, so you guys don't like each other,

952
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,670
you know, one that, anything
he says you're, you know,
you're already defensive,

953
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,550
but it's weird man, how
you can, how that happened.

954
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:19,290
Like that's happened to me before as it
wasn't as overt, but just like, yeah,

955
00:57:19,291 --> 00:57:22,540
I don't really feel that guy, you
know, I don't like I went because I,

956
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,580
not only is he like when you look at them,
whatever,

957
00:57:24,581 --> 00:57:25,660
they're kind of competitive with you,

958
00:57:25,661 --> 00:57:28,930
but maybe they do something just this
much different than you, you know,

959
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:31,600
like it just different in philosophy or
something like that. So I was like, oh,

960
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,493
I'm against that guy.

961
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:35,740
And then they open their mouth and say
one word to you and it's real nice.

962
00:57:35,741 --> 00:57:38,290
You're like, Oh, I love that guy.
You know, just one little thing,

963
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:40,990
just one little like, hey, I'm cool.
You know, I like you kind of thing.

964
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,780
And it's like, oh man. Yeah. When they
say something humble to you, yeah.

965
00:57:43,781 --> 00:57:47,480
It disarms your ego and you're
all of a sudden your bros. Yeah.

966
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:51,040
So weird how that is.
If they escalate the ego situation,

967
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:53,270
which then it's very
problematic cup until the time.

968
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:57,640
I mean really that's the natural course
of things cause you do have to put on

969
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:59,740
the brakes on your feelings and be like,
okay,

970
00:57:59,741 --> 00:58:02,380
let's make a different kind of
decision than the automatic one.

971
00:58:02,381 --> 00:58:04,960
I've got to switch to manual
real quick and then boom.

972
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,510
But the bottom line is you're going to
interact with all kinds of different

973
00:58:07,511 --> 00:58:10,090
people. If you're in any kind of
team whatsoever, which is most,

974
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:14,410
most human beings interact with
other human beings through their job,

975
00:58:14,411 --> 00:58:17,320
through their life, through, I mean you
can apply this to your family too, right?

976
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:20,620
There's someone in your family
that you don't get along with.

977
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:23,260
Well what good does it do?

978
00:58:23,261 --> 00:58:28,090
Does it make your family unit better
when you let those emotions play out?

979
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:30,910
And let your ego play out. No,
it doesn't. You're better off.

980
00:58:30,911 --> 00:58:33,370
You'll get further and
you'll have a better,

981
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:39,420
you'll have a better life in your family
if you put your ego in check and say,

982
00:58:40,151 --> 00:58:41,950
you know what, I'm just going to
build a relationship with this person.

983
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:46,350
It's going to make everything better
and smoother. It's like, man, if he,

984
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:51,430
I feel like you can take the place of any
marriage counselor by just saying that

985
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:54,430
for real. Like all you gotta
do it and they got to do it,

986
00:58:54,431 --> 00:58:55,810
but all you gotta do is ask like,

987
00:58:55,811 --> 00:58:59,440
is this going to help the relationship
with my wife or my family, whoever it is,

988
00:58:59,441 --> 00:59:00,070
and your,

989
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,920
is this going to help their relationship
if I do this or don't do this or is it

990
00:59:02,921 --> 00:59:04,780
going to hurt it? And
that's it. That's it.

991
00:59:04,781 --> 00:59:06,900
That's super general question
and whatever, but it's,

992
00:59:06,901 --> 00:59:09,700
it's so cut and dry most of the time.
You know, of course there's exceptions,

993
00:59:09,701 --> 00:59:12,520
but generally speaking it's pretty
cut and dry and be like, okay,

994
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:16,000
in a lot of time, just like I said, it
has to do with like your ego or your,

995
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:18,130
you know, this, this sense of vengeance,

996
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:22,100
little micro sense of vengeance
because I can't believe she doesn't

997
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,580
respect the fact that I took
out the trash, you know,

998
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:28,730
she asked me to take their trash all the
time. Finally, when I do it, nothing,

999
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,650
you know,
like tell him it's just that

1000
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:36,190
I was talking to a friend of mine
and we were talking about you.

1001
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:39,910
You know, I've talked about the
mutiny that I had the opportunity,

1002
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:44,560
but we had a mutiny. We fight, we had a
mutiny against our, our platoon commander.

1003
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,180
We fired,
he got fired.

1004
00:59:46,181 --> 00:59:48,910
And then the other guy that came in to
take his place was like the best guy.

1005
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:53,410
And I was talking to a guy that worked
with him much later when he was a senior

1006
00:59:53,411 --> 00:59:57,730
senior guy and I was
telling him, I was like, oh,

1007
00:59:57,850 --> 01:00:01,870
when I talk on the podcast about the
platoon commander, that was like the best.

1008
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:05,790
That's who I'm talking to. He's like,
no way. And, and this guy worked with,

1009
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:10,330
he's a senior guy and he says, you
know, when he, when I worked with him,

1010
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:11,343
he would take out,

1011
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:15,790
he would take out the trash from the
office every day and he and I started

1012
01:00:15,791 --> 01:00:17,890
laughing. I'm like,
that's a, that's right.

1013
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:21,460
And I'd be looking and he was saying
like, Oh, I look at him and be like, sir,

1014
01:00:21,461 --> 01:00:23,680
you don't, you don't need to do that. It's
like, no, no, no. It's all good. You know,

1015
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:26,290
someone's got to take out the
trash. I got it. This is a seat.

1016
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:30,640
A guy that shouldn't have been
taking out trash for 25 years,

1017
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:34,450
taking out the trash. Was He picking
up breath and picking up brass,

1018
01:00:34,451 --> 01:00:38,740
taking out trash? That's,
that's being humble.

1019
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,450
Being humble goes a long way.
Next year.

1020
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:48,310
We've got time for one
more because I got stuffed

1021
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:52,300
I,

1022
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,640
I'm a veteran in graduate school.

1023
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:58,120
My mother passed away in April
and it took a few weeks off.

1024
01:00:58,540 --> 01:00:59,710
While that was helpful,

1025
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:04,030
I'm struggling returning to work my
peers or younger and inexperienced.

1026
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:08,740
I'm the oldest and look in the cohort and
probably the first vet to come to this

1027
01:01:08,741 --> 01:01:13,270
Grad program have already had some
uphill battles and up to this point,

1028
01:01:13,271 --> 01:01:17,410
I truly believe I was worthy of
my own suffering. Now though,

1029
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:22,660
after sobbing on a plane while listening
to episode one 22 I don't feel as

1030
01:01:22,661 --> 01:01:25,810
worthy. I wasn't there for my
mother when she died. In fact,

1031
01:01:25,811 --> 01:01:29,980
I cut her out due to her drinking,
which is what killed her.

1032
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:34,030
I've lost people close to me
in the past and in the service,

1033
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:37,510
but this is different. I know
one thing. I'm a fighter.

1034
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:41,590
I've had to fight all my life to get
where I am, but I'm feeling deflated.

1035
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:50,780
I mean, you start with, of
course you feel deflated

1036
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:57,370
because you lost your mom.
That's,

1037
01:01:57,430 --> 01:01:58,263
that's normal.

1038
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:03,600
But what is not normal and what you have
to fight against is staying deflated.

1039
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,340
So I mean, listen,

1040
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:15,370
you're mom is gone and you
should certainly mourn that
you weren't by her side

1041
01:02:16,791 --> 01:02:17,630
when she died.

1042
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:24,680
And this is due to the fact that you had
to cut her off and you had to cut her

1043
01:02:24,721 --> 01:02:27,210
off because of her drinking.

1044
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:30,270
If you don't cut someone off when
they're going down that path,

1045
01:02:30,271 --> 01:02:34,800
you're only enabling them.
And that is not the right thing to do.

1046
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:38,973
Okay?

1047
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:41,850
And of course

1048
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:48,530
we want to be able to save
everyone that's absolutely,

1049
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:52,890
we want to be able to save everyone,
especially our own family members.

1050
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:59,130
But the fact of the matter is that you,

1051
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:04,950
you just can't save everyone.
No one can,

1052
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:11,970
no one can.
Addiction is

1053
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:13,640
okay

1054
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,910
in many cases,
stronger than us.

1055
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:22,990
Stronger than anything.
Stronger than love, destroy,

1056
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:26,960
believe it or not,
stronger than life itself.

1057
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:30,410
Sometimes that's how strong addiction is

1058
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:38,590
and you cannot and are not
expected to be able to defeat that.

1059
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:46,053
Okay?

1060
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:49,260
So you did what you could

1061
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:57,800
and in the end the battle was lost,
not because of you,

1062
01:03:57,801 --> 01:03:59,720
but because of addiction

1063
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:08,980
and it is hard to face that kind of loss.

1064
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,080
But now

1065
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:24,420
how are you going to look at this?
How are you going to deal with us?

1066
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:31,110
I look at it like this.
Your mother,

1067
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:36,890
your mother gave you a gift,

1068
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,920
a precious gift

1069
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:44,950
she gave you the gift of knowledge

1070
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:48,290
took that knowledge,

1071
01:04:48,291 --> 01:04:53,291
allows you to see how destructive
that force of addiction can be.

1072
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:56,750
You saw it destroy her.

1073
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:04,560
You saw that addiction destroy
her because she showed it to you.

1074
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:08,460
That was her last gift to you.
She,

1075
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:14,010
she's actually given you life twice,
once at birth and once at her death.

1076
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:23,620
She's actually shown you how to
live by showing you how not to live.

1077
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:36,260
So
thank your mother for that.

1078
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:45,210
Literally thank or literally go to her
grave side and get down on your knees and

1079
01:05:45,611 --> 01:05:47,770
say thank you to her

1080
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,770
and then tell her that
you won't let her down

1081
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:02,900
and then tell her that you
will learn from her lesson

1082
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:12,360
and then tell her that you will
go on to live an incredible life,

1083
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:20,750
a life that she would be proud of,
a life that she didn't have,

1084
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:22,843
but a life

1085
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:28,270
that she is making sure you can have.

1086
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:36,223
Now you said

1087
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,230
that you're a fighter and that's the one
thing you know is that you're a fighter.

1088
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,630
Well now get out there

1089
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:48,863
than fight

1090
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:58,010
and you know that that question and kind
of thinking about the answer to that

1091
01:06:59,491 --> 01:07:04,491
question that got me thinking about an
article that I read about Anthony Bordain

1092
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:08,580
and Anthony Bordain.

1093
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:13,660
Obviously he was about as
successful as as anyone could be.

1094
01:07:15,930 --> 01:07:20,370
I mean he was a successful guy
in so many aspects and yet,

1095
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,130
and yet he killed himself

1096
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:30,130
and I didn't know him personally,
but you know,

1097
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:35,320
he knew people that I know. You know
he was, he was friends with Joe Rogan.

1098
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:40,600
He was, he was friends with Harley Flan.
Again, he was friends with guys that,

1099
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:43,840
guys that have really good guys.

1100
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:52,540
And so in that way I kind of felt like
I knew what kind of a guy who was at

1101
01:07:52,911 --> 01:07:57,840
least,
and even from the outside,

1102
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:00,990
even without having any
connections to them at all,

1103
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:06,030
he was the kind of guy that had
just about everything that, that,

1104
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:07,650
that most people would want.

1105
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:16,220
And even still, I mean,
obviously that wasn't enough.

1106
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:23,020
Well,
in the article that I read,

1107
01:08:23,021 --> 01:08:27,160
there was a quote from one
of Anthony Bourdain's books,

1108
01:08:27,161 --> 01:08:30,160
and the book was called a cook's tour.

1109
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:33,850
He said, in this book, I wanted

1110
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:35,450
adventures.

1111
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:42,520
I wanted to go up the known river to
the heart of darkness in Cambodia.

1112
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:49,630
I wanted to ride out into a desert
on camelback sand and dunes in every

1113
01:08:51,021 --> 01:08:51,854
direction,

1114
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:56,030
eat whole roasted lamb with my fingers.

1115
01:08:57,870 --> 01:09:02,250
I wanted to kick snow off my boots
in a Mafia nightclub in Russia.

1116
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:05,310
I wanted to play with automatic
weapons in Phnom Penh,

1117
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:10,020
recapture the past in a small
oyster village in France,

1118
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,610
step into a CD,
neon lit,

1119
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,550
pull Korea in rural Mexico.

1120
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:24,240
I wanted to run roadblocks in the middle
of the night blowing past angry militia

1121
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:28,050
with a handful of her old marble packs

1122
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:35,590
experience, fear, excitement,
wonder. I wanted kicks.

1123
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,360
The kind of mellow,

1124
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:42,940
dramatic thrills and chills
I'd yearned for since childhood

1125
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:49,350
kind of adventure I'd found as a
little boy in the pages of my tin,

1126
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:50,730
tin comic books.

1127
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:57,970
I wanted to see the world and I wanted
the world to be just like the movies.

1128
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:09,880
That's what Anthony Bourdain said,
just like the movies.

1129
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:18,470
But you know what?
To me

1130
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,230
world is not like the movies.

1131
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:29,790
The movies aren't real.
They don't exist,

1132
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:34,240
but you do.

1133
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:40,130
And life,
this life is,

1134
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:44,060
it's better than any movie.
There is moves.

1135
01:10:44,061 --> 01:10:46,880
They're supposed to provoke emotion.

1136
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:49,400
They're supposed to
make you feel something,

1137
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:53,400
but I have a better idea.

1138
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:58,230
Go out into the world
and actually feel it.

1139
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:06,190
Go feel joy and love and triumph
and rapture and ecstasy and glory.

1140
01:11:10,551 --> 01:11:12,440
Go feel those things.

1141
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:19,740
And you know with those feelings

1142
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:23,280
there will be other feelings as well.

1143
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:26,200
It'll be okay.

1144
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:31,400
Sorrow and pain and
sadness and desolation and

1145
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:34,313
suffering.

1146
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:40,360
There'll be all those feelings too.
But you know what?

1147
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:47,123
That's okay.

1148
01:11:50,150 --> 01:11:54,500
That's okay. Take both
sides. Feel all of it.

1149
01:11:54,501 --> 01:11:59,360
That's what life is. Those
feelings, those emotions,

1150
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:02,210
those highs and those lows,

1151
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:04,670
those are life

1152
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:15,020
and those emotions and those feelings
are better than 80 movie because they are

1153
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,133
real.

1154
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:26,820
So make your own
comic book,

1155
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:31,260
Make Your Life Your own movie bet.

1156
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:36,100
Actually make it better than a movie.
Not,

1157
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:41,640
not better because it's more adventurous
or more romantic or more mellow.

1158
01:12:43,871 --> 01:12:48,070
Dramatic. Make it better
because it's real.

1159
01:12:52,730 --> 01:12:54,770
It's real.
So it is better.

1160
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:59,030
And you know what real
comes with some downsides.

1161
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:04,570
You'll comes with some darkness.

1162
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:14,460
Yeah,
but that's okay.

1163
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,840
It's okay.
Because when you know the darkness,

1164
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:24,560
the light becomes even brighter.

1165
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:29,653
Yeah.

1166
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:32,840
So go out there,
move toward the light,

1167
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:35,090
move toward

1168
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:37,523
the light

1169
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:41,493
and live,

1170
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:46,973
live.

1171
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:57,320
And I think that's
all I've got

1172
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:03,050
for tonight. So, so echo,

1173
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:07,670
let's talk to people a little bit about

1174
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:12,130
how support this podcast

1175
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:16,570
and at the same time moved themselves
a little further away from the darkness

1176
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:18,160
and a little bit closer

1177
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:20,363
to the light

1178
01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:25,940
cause we make the podcast so everyone
can learn. And if you want to

1179
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:29,380
support the podcast,

1180
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:34,150
there are some really
good ways to do it and

1181
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:38,500
that's the goal.
Sports podcasts,

1182
01:14:38,501 --> 01:14:42,790
and you're supporting yourself
at the same time. So we got,

1183
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:47,530
they go hand in hand. Agree hundred
thousand percent not possible,

1184
01:14:47,531 --> 01:14:50,280
but we'll deal with it. Can you agree?
One thing, you know how they say,

1185
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:53,290
I agree with you 110% I agree with you,

1186
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:58,030
but I think I feel 10% even more strong
than what you just said. You know?

1187
01:14:58,110 --> 01:15:02,570
Okay. Technically that could be anyway.

1188
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:03,250
Yes.

1189
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:08,170
So we'll start with the
origin or gene USA in Maine,

1190
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:13,390
Farmington, Maine, to be
exact American made products.
What do we got? Okay. Geese.

1191
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:14,061
That's really the,

1192
01:15:14,061 --> 01:15:19,061
the flagship I liked the word flagship
flagship product is the Gif Main Ford.

1193
01:15:21,481 --> 01:15:24,700
You get to specifically
for Jujitsu in America,

1194
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:30,840
also made for specifically Jujitsu but
usable for many different activities like

1195
01:15:35,021 --> 01:15:39,730
making a suit, rash guards. Oh
yeah. It's like flagship. Right.

1196
01:15:39,731 --> 01:15:43,840
Which I agree with. You also have
rash guards and other stuff. Stuff,

1197
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:47,770
compression gear, compression
gear. Yeah. Spats, if you will.

1198
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:52,330
A yet for sure.
But the gies aren't just like gies though.

1199
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:56,680
See what I'm saying? They're not just
a general that guid made in America,

1200
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:57,633
by the way,

1201
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:01,900
for judges to specifically when you move
into Jujitsu is different than moving

1202
01:16:01,901 --> 01:16:05,710
in. I don't know, whatever else
you might wear a g in Veg, tennis,

1203
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:08,290
whatever.
Bro.

1204
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:11,850
You were saying you're going to make a
suit with the dragon is kind of crazy.

1205
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:15,850
Yes. I have an idea of something
to make with the Dragon. We've,

1206
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,500
I'm going to talk to Pete about, all
right. What does it lay it on me state.

1207
01:16:18,510 --> 01:16:22,480
He'd reveal. Reveal,
believe it or not. Boots.

1208
01:16:23,230 --> 01:16:27,130
Boots. Okay. Yeah. So they wouldn't
be full drag? No, no, no. They'd be,

1209
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:30,430
they'd be very similar to the
old school Vietnam jungle boots,

1210
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:34,990
but they'd have the dragon. We
instead of canvas, they'd have dragon.

1211
01:16:34,991 --> 01:16:38,650
We've and because,
which I think is the PR,

1212
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:42,940
literally the perfect material for
the kids, the jungle. But old school,

1213
01:16:42,941 --> 01:16:46,090
jungle boots are part leather, leather,
like leather around the toe and the heel.

1214
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:50,820
But then they have canvas on the sides.
And I,

1215
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:53,650
I wore jungle and I still wear
jungle boots. I love junk.

1216
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,040
So if we made,

1217
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:01,270
because the cotton canvas
does stay wet longer,

1218
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:04,870
but if we use the dragon, we've, it
dries quicker cause it's a blend.

1219
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:08,650
But cotton is also very
comfortable to wear.

1220
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:13,280
It allows circulation so many ways.
That's what, well, I'll talk to Pete,

1221
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:15,290
we'll make it happen,
but it's still the,

1222
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:20,290
the shorts that I have no one else can
have is dragging me for it. Yeah. Okay.

1223
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:21,830
So let's talking to Pete about little,

1224
01:17:21,831 --> 01:17:24,020
I'll make some more and we went to the
thing and that's whole other thing.

1225
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,750
But here's, here's what I
do remember. Get if you,

1226
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:30,950
since you brought up boots where,
okay, so those shorts, you know,

1227
01:17:30,951 --> 01:17:35,900
I have kids and with kids comes messes.
We don't worry, they'll spill some,

1228
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:39,260
I dunno, whatever. So stuff will
land on those shorts and you know,

1229
01:17:39,261 --> 01:17:39,981
the kind where it's like,
Dang,

1230
01:17:39,981 --> 01:17:41,750
I don't want to take off
the shirt and go wash them.

1231
01:17:41,751 --> 01:17:45,290
Like let me just put some water. But
then some of the messages, I can't,

1232
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:47,480
you can't just put water and he goes away.
You got to scrub it.

1233
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:48,950
But if they're like normal shorts,

1234
01:17:48,951 --> 01:17:51,560
I'm a scrub it with like a brush and it's
going to kind of mess up the shorts a

1235
01:17:51,561 --> 01:17:52,820
little bit right there,
you know?

1236
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,640
It'll make it like kind of free it'll
frame or something like that. Brad,

1237
01:17:56,650 --> 01:17:57,260
now these ones for,

1238
01:17:57,260 --> 01:18:00,510
I'm scrubbing it with a steel wool
thing to get the thing out. Brad.

1239
01:18:00,511 --> 01:18:04,800
The thing is like new still aside from
like the cotton part feeds right? The,

1240
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:07,850
you know how to blend and I told the
cotton ones will fade so it has this

1241
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:10,700
awesome little gray striped
with black is Brett's dope.

1242
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:16,160
Incidental dopeness improvement in the,

1243
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:20,140
in the aesthetic look. That's a side
note, but I'm saying it's tough with it.

1244
01:18:20,141 --> 01:18:23,900
You see what I'm saying? So it kind of
makes sense now dragon, we boots, boom,

1245
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,460
you're in the jungle fishing,

1246
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:28,340
whatever else we're doing with them
and they handle, you know what I mean?

1247
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,880
I'll work on it. Would you make it
like on the inside? Would it be,

1248
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:35,330
what do you call it, water
proof or whatever. That's
the thing with jungle boots.

1249
01:18:35,331 --> 01:18:36,900
You don't want them waterproof.
They're brew.

1250
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:40,640
They're highly review of little
islets. Oh yeah. Little drains.

1251
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:45,530
So you want them highly breathable,
like, like not even breathable open.

1252
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:47,630
Yeah,
there's holes.

1253
01:18:47,950 --> 01:18:52,490
It's purposely put in there so that this
concept is real Jujitsu ish. You know,

1254
01:18:52,491 --> 01:18:55,640
cause like on, I at first thought you'd
be like, Hey, you're gonna walk in water.

1255
01:18:55,641 --> 01:19:00,200
We need to fight that water. Allow the
water in it. It allowed the ladder out.

1256
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:03,860
Yeah, man. That's good. That's good.
See Brad, that's why you're advanced.

1257
01:19:04,050 --> 01:19:05,300
See you think about these constraints.

1258
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:07,640
Speaking of being
advanced and comfortable,

1259
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:12,470
advanced comfort with the joggers
and the sweats. It's my experience.

1260
01:19:12,471 --> 01:19:16,220
Try for yourself. Many people, actually I
saw the guy today, maybe yesterday, today,

1261
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:20,960
yesterday, I forget, but he
got the Hoodie, one of origins
Hoodie. Boom. Seconded.

1262
01:19:20,961 --> 01:19:24,410
That exact notion. Most comfortable
that he ever he's ever had.

1263
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,420
That's a bold state and I could just see,

1264
01:19:26,421 --> 01:19:30,740
tell from his profile picture that he
knew about comfort. I Dunno. It just,

1265
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:34,910
I just could feel it. Nonetheless.
It happened factually. Also,

1266
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:39,911
we got some supplements up there
on the origin main.com website.

1267
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:45,360
You can get some supplements and
supplements. Power. Some good ones. Yeah,

1268
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:49,910
so joint warfare. That one.
What could we call that one?

1269
01:19:49,911 --> 01:19:52,470
A flagship supplement.
You could call every,

1270
01:19:52,490 --> 01:19:56,750
and I'm going to call it a flection in
the flagship is good man. Someone said,

1271
01:19:57,260 --> 01:20:02,030
someone said on social media, go back
to the old way you were doing this.

1272
01:20:02,031 --> 01:20:06,170
A porch sounds clunky.
Is it?

1273
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:10,110
Get it back to echo. He said, you know
what? I said, couldn't take it anymore.

1274
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:13,260
I'm going to be honest.

1275
01:20:13,261 --> 01:20:18,261
I will accept the possibility probability
of you not being the only one that

1276
01:20:19,441 --> 01:20:24,000
thought that I'm going to go with it.
That one guy though,

1277
01:20:24,001 --> 01:20:28,770
he was fired up enough to tweet
me and say, Bra sounds clunky.

1278
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:32,550
Dang. I kind of appreciate
it. Your stove. I really do.

1279
01:20:32,551 --> 01:20:35,880
Now that we could have a separate podcast
where he could just do some horse the

1280
01:20:35,881 --> 01:20:39,570
whole time. Separate. Yeah.
Yeah. You can kind of choose,

1281
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,990
choose your own supports maybe.
Nonetheless.

1282
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:45,840
Now this is what we're doing and we're
going with joint with joint warfare.

1283
01:20:45,950 --> 01:20:46,710
Join Warfare,
right.

1284
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:49,620
Good for your joints will make
it three is good for your joints,

1285
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:52,950
and that's in Krill oil.
So you got joint where heard glucosomine,

1286
01:20:52,970 --> 01:20:55,920
conjoint and curcumin. That
helps you bring, by the way,

1287
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:58,710
as we find out additionally,

1288
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:03,630
then you got a job that Patrick,
Rhonda Patrick, right? Yeah,

1289
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:07,680
I read that too by the way. It's
good. Uh, then you got, okay,

1290
01:21:07,681 --> 01:21:10,500
so you've got joint warfare. Boom,
come close to me and can drain.

1291
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:14,070
That's what for I think cartilage, if
I'm not mistaken. Joints, all this stuff.

1292
01:21:14,071 --> 01:21:17,820
Boom. Pure cumin for some brains and
memory stuff. Boom. That's joint warfare.

1293
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:21,600
Then you've got Jocko Super Krill. It's
where he joined. So make it threes.

1294
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:24,990
And that's also for other
parts of your anatomy.

1295
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:30,050
Staff will say your whole internal system.
You say Uris,

1296
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:32,820
eyes, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs,

1297
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:36,840
Oregon's brains and you crack open a
Krill oil capsule and put it directly into

1298
01:21:36,841 --> 01:21:40,720
your eyes. Is that a good
thing? I'm assuming? No,

1299
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,550
but yeah,
let's not do that.

1300
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,860
Been on Krill oil for so long.
Yeah.

1301
01:21:48,330 --> 01:21:51,210
People like I don't want
to ever go off of it. Yeah,

1302
01:21:51,330 --> 01:21:53,310
I think that's a good idea
to never go off of it.

1303
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,930
The reason is because I had a
guy many years ago that was a,

1304
01:21:58,590 --> 01:22:02,480
this is when I was probably 35.
Sure.

1305
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:07,110
I met a guy that was 53,
I think,

1306
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:11,910
and he was cured and he was jacked,
but he wasn't, he wasn't Jack like, uh,

1307
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:15,660
like a, uh, big bodybuilder
juiced up guide, just Jack,

1308
01:22:15,661 --> 01:22:20,280
like totally athletic and in
really great shape. And I was like,

1309
01:22:20,281 --> 01:22:23,910
hey man, what's the deal with, you
know, and he's like, I take Krill oil.

1310
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:28,620
That's easy. That's the
secret he's attributing. Yeah,
he attributed all of this.

1311
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:31,500
Now. He was a competitive
power lifter at what time?

1312
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:33,630
So he had maintained and
continued to work out.

1313
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:37,980
But he was basically saying that
to me as if we already knew that.

1314
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:42,030
But we already know that you got to Jack
Steele. Like we, that's a given. I'm just,

1315
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:44,660
cause I was talking to him for awhile
and we were talking about lifting and

1316
01:22:44,661 --> 01:22:47,340
we're talking about this and, and
then finally, you know, I got to like,

1317
01:22:47,350 --> 01:22:49,320
cause what do you think it is?
And he's like, I take Krill oil.

1318
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:54,060
This was before and I was
like, okay. Sometimes when
somebody tells you something,

1319
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:54,980
you're just like,

1320
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:59,050
you just look at the guy and when they
give that much weight to it, yeah.

1321
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:03,500
It's like, okay, we're going with
that. And what's cool is that that's,

1322
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:05,800
I definitely,
I definitely felt

1323
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:10,230
the difference in my joints.
Yeah.

1324
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:15,250
I don't know about my eyeballs, although
I don't wear glasses at this point. Yeah.

1325
01:23:15,251 --> 01:23:18,700
There it is. Proof of that. That's,
that's something, that's not nothing,

1326
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:23,020
that's for sure. And the same way
you, you um, well not in the same way,

1327
01:23:23,021 --> 01:23:27,540
but slightly similar way. You had the
power lifter guy talk about Krill oil.

1328
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:30,920
My father in law, as I've mentioned
before, told me about critical,

1329
01:23:30,950 --> 01:23:35,620
but way better than fish oil.
And you know, he's telling
me or what was he jacked?

1330
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:39,700
He, here's the thing, he wasn't jacked
and here this is part of the whole story.

1331
01:23:39,730 --> 01:23:44,140
Which kid is going to kind of feed into
your point? No, he is not jacked at all.

1332
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:48,580
In fact, Meniam go lift by. This guy
shouldn't even be in the same gym with me.

1333
01:23:49,010 --> 01:23:52,170
He should be in the democracy is going
to hear this podcast. I don't care.

1334
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:55,690
Absolutely a hundred percent sure not
really doing a good job building that

1335
01:23:55,691 --> 01:23:59,110
relationship with the family at
the end of the day, Yo Yo feel,

1336
01:23:59,111 --> 01:24:03,760
see the moral and I think it will.
I think anyway, so no, not jack.

1337
01:24:03,761 --> 01:24:08,230
The answer is no. Um, he can
swim for ever, ever. In fact,

1338
01:24:08,231 --> 01:24:11,440
he goes into Hawaii,
me and Molly waters with the,

1339
01:24:11,441 --> 01:24:15,080
you know the web hands for swimming
body board. He's using them.

1340
01:24:15,610 --> 01:24:19,390
They're just west spongers. Yeah,
sure. He doesn't, you know, it's funny,

1341
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:23,470
but he's a swimmer, so he'll just swim
hour, boom. Just swimming. Anyway.

1342
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:28,010
He'd always say, you know, Krill oil, all
this stuff. But yeah, he's not jacked.

1343
01:24:28,011 --> 01:24:31,600
He didn't lift like why he could use
take Krill oil and you get your x, Y,

1344
01:24:31,601 --> 01:24:34,930
z results. Cool. I don't
want those x, Y, Z results.

1345
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:39,320
Those results that you're essentially
benefiting from apparently aren't applied

1346
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:44,140
to my goals. Chat on. Exactly right.
So I'm like, okay, cool. I get it.

1347
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:47,290
Health nut. She's a health nut he sent
to health. That's a positive thing.

1348
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:50,600
It's not bad. There's, there's
worse things to be a nut about.

1349
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:53,590
I'll tell you that health is a good thing
anyway cause into health is a little

1350
01:24:53,591 --> 01:24:58,240
bit better to be out. But that's
true. I'm not going to disagree.

1351
01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:02,800
So you know, for years and I'm
like cool, good for the info. Yeah.

1352
01:25:02,830 --> 01:25:05,560
Then you come along and you're
like, yeah, Krill oil. Boom.

1353
01:25:05,561 --> 01:25:08,320
Next day I'm on the
Krill literally next day.

1354
01:25:08,710 --> 01:25:12,220
And so of course he's been saying
it the whole time or whatever,

1355
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:17,130
but at the end of the day he's right.
He's absolutely right. He was right. Yeah.

1356
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:22,210
So the moral of the story is
you could be right and not jack.

1357
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:28,300
Yes. I got to kind of separate,
you know, my, what do you call,

1358
01:25:28,301 --> 01:25:30,450
I got to detach. This is
what I got it, you know,

1359
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:34,570
like an older guy with the ability to do
the things and at the health level he's

1360
01:25:34,571 --> 01:25:38,560
at, I do want for myself regardless how
much weight I can lift, I can't lift.

1361
01:25:39,310 --> 01:25:42,280
That's what I want. That's
what challenge man. Big Time.

1362
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:46,360
And here's the thing I didn't think
indirectly as well because the better your

1363
01:25:46,361 --> 01:25:49,240
joints feel, especially as you
get older, but just in life,

1364
01:25:49,241 --> 01:25:52,060
regardless how old you are,
the better your joints are functioning,

1365
01:25:52,210 --> 01:25:57,210
the more you're going to be able to lift
or move a mountain climb or right bike

1366
01:25:58,870 --> 01:26:03,710
or compete in back mitten, badminton.
How do you say that? Bad Mitt to,

1367
01:26:03,711 --> 01:26:07,280
okay. Yeah, competing that
that's true value. We all stiff.

1368
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:10,730
We don't need tennis or badminton elbow,
you know,

1369
01:26:11,230 --> 01:26:15,380
for anyway Krill oil, that's the one
Omega threes and then you have discipline,

1370
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:18,290
right? And that's where your
brain memory, how many things,

1371
01:26:18,291 --> 01:26:20,030
so they play into each other.
You see what I'm saying?

1372
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:22,760
So the joint warfare has a
brain stuff and the joint stuff.

1373
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:26,810
Krill oil has the joint stuff.
Really good day at Jujitsu the other day,

1374
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:31,010
and I was talking to Dave Burke on my way
home from Jujitsu. Could deal, did. Yeah,

1375
01:26:31,011 --> 01:26:35,720
good deal Dave. And I was like, I was, you
know, he, you said only I trained today.

1376
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:40,700
I was like, I had a really good day.
What does that mean? I'm like, oh,

1377
01:26:40,701 --> 01:26:43,640
I'll just means, you know, like
just getting after just, yeah,

1378
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,030
and I realized that the past.
Anyways,

1379
01:26:47,031 --> 01:26:50,390
I realized that I've been taking
like three scoops of discipline.

1380
01:26:52,910 --> 01:26:57,230
Is that even legal? Yeah. Well, you
know, it could be. It should be.

1381
01:26:57,590 --> 01:26:58,930
Maybe. Yeah. Well,

1382
01:26:58,950 --> 01:27:02,390
depends on what you mean by fair because
if you're going in to compete with your

1383
01:27:02,391 --> 01:27:06,230
training partners, which you do from
time to time, let's face it then. Yeah,

1384
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:09,790
it's a little bit of an advantage.
Fair. No, it's actually,

1385
01:27:09,810 --> 01:27:13,790
it's fair Andy or whoever you
go into train with Dean, me,

1386
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:18,590
we could take three things that
discipline if you want it to, one or two.

1387
01:27:18,591 --> 01:27:22,340
If it's fair, it's fair. In
fact, I recommend take three
things, a discipline, boom.

1388
01:27:22,430 --> 01:27:27,410
There it is. This one,
cognitive enhancing, so they
all play with each other.

1389
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:30,320
That's important.
Very important.

1390
01:27:31,550 --> 01:27:33,770
I think regardless of
how much you can lift,

1391
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:39,240
check also Moke,
Moke what is small?

1392
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:42,590
What is that?
Who is sold as just asking me about more.

1393
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:46,400
And the best thing about when people
ask you what mark is, as you get it,

1394
01:27:46,730 --> 01:27:51,320
you get a chance to do the routine.
You get a chance to do the routine.

1395
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:54,260
When someone's like,
I'll talk about what time

1396
01:27:56,030 --> 01:28:00,380
you get to do the routine, which is what's
milk? Oh, it's mark. That's the routine.

1397
01:28:00,381 --> 01:28:03,220
That's 13 well, what is it?
It's more, no, it's mold.

1398
01:28:03,730 --> 01:28:08,050
You want some kind of a
explanation? You're like, no,
no, it's, it's more, yeah.

1399
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:10,520
Common sense really.
After you say that,

1400
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:15,380
you just take common sense from there
and boom, clear. Yeah. That's my goal.

1401
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:20,990
My goal is that it ends up in the
Oxford English dictionary, like Xerox.

1402
01:28:20,991 --> 01:28:24,080
And then if someone doesn't know what
it is, they can just go look it up.

1403
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:26,150
I'll look it up in the dictionary.
By the way,

1404
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:32,090
Google is Google in there for like,
all right,

1405
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:35,900
go Google that. Well, yeah, so you
could go Google [inaudible]. Yeah, yeah.

1406
01:28:36,170 --> 01:28:39,170
It's there. You'll find it. Yes
sir. You will know what it is. Well,

1407
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:43,220
you'll know that it's tasty,
but got it said, hey, I, I,

1408
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:46,250
I don't use protein powders,

1409
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:50,360
but does it taste that good?
So I should just get it anyways.

1410
01:28:50,570 --> 01:28:53,300
My answer was a hundred percent
run sounding. Absolutely.

1411
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:56,870
You just want to have a really
good dessert. Give him milk.

1412
01:28:57,350 --> 01:29:00,020
Peanut butter's is common.
So Dave Burke is,

1413
01:29:00,050 --> 01:29:02,440
Dave Burk is on the path to uh,

1414
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:08,210
to order all the food on the peanut butter
chocolate anyway, so the whole supply,

1415
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:11,020
yeah, he wants all supply. Not a
bad idea. She had thought about,

1416
01:29:12,290 --> 01:29:16,740
if you didn't know, look, I'm going to
violate some terminologies scenarios here.

1417
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:18,900
Mark is protein powder.

1418
01:29:19,530 --> 01:29:24,530
It's actually Moke GMN the best protein
powder that tastes like a dessert

1419
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:27,750
straight up does though.
Not just claims and doesn't,

1420
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:30,750
it does straight up literally a,

1421
01:29:30,751 --> 01:29:35,751
and we will have milk at the immersion
camp this summer up in Maine on Echo Lake

1422
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:40,650
layers August 26 through September
2nd two sessions come up there.

1423
01:29:40,770 --> 01:29:43,260
I'll be there. Life will be there. Echo.

1424
01:29:43,261 --> 01:29:46,650
Charles will be there and apparently
you say you will be rolling, you know,

1425
01:29:46,651 --> 01:29:47,460
limited,

1426
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:52,350
limited rolling from from which sounds
like predetermined excuses, which is fine.

1427
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:57,360
Yeah. Well here. Okay. All
right, well let, let me lay
it out then playboy. Ah, the,

1428
01:29:57,630 --> 01:30:01,200
the gooey I'll be doing less of because
Ge has a lot more group grouping,

1429
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:05,850
grouping, pulling, so pulling.
I'm really out of pulling.

1430
01:30:05,851 --> 01:30:08,250
I can't do bullying.
You're very limited maybe with one hand,

1431
01:30:08,251 --> 01:30:11,850
so I'll do geeky but it's like okay now
I'm rolling literally with one end by

1432
01:30:11,851 --> 01:30:13,610
the way will be there.
Yeah,

1433
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:17,490
Dean lister will be there and if
you want to learn from someone,

1434
01:30:17,491 --> 01:30:21,240
he is one of the top people
in the world to learn from.

1435
01:30:21,390 --> 01:30:23,700
And I know that's a bold statement.
I know it is.

1436
01:30:24,870 --> 01:30:29,870
He's got a mind that understands not
only the mechanics and the concepts of

1437
01:30:32,281 --> 01:30:34,430
Jujitsu at an added,

1438
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,990
but one of the highest levels of
anyone I've ever communicated with,

1439
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:40,890
but also knows how to express
those concepts in a very clear way.

1440
01:30:40,940 --> 01:30:43,050
So immersion camp,

1441
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:48,660
August 26 through September 2nd go and
come up there. We'll see you up there.

1442
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:52,050
Good place there. And we will
have mock there. Yes, lots of it.

1443
01:30:52,290 --> 01:30:56,610
And Dean's good at at kind of taking
the concept and really clarifying the

1444
01:30:56,611 --> 01:30:59,290
concept even separate from
the action for sure. If,

1445
01:30:59,310 --> 01:31:03,030
I mean the mood is always attached but
dean says things sometimes that I run

1446
01:31:03,031 --> 01:31:06,180
over and take note, take like a
little, a little note on my uh,

1447
01:31:06,630 --> 01:31:10,310
on my phone and I call it, that's
a good one. And usually I say,

1448
01:31:10,350 --> 01:31:12,880
usually I'm thinking I'm going to, when
we, when he comes on the podcast, I'll,

1449
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:17,180
I'm going to have him talk about those
things so we'll pick them up. Oh,

1450
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:22,510
so good way to support is the fact we're
on top of the fact or as part of the

1451
01:31:23,341 --> 01:31:27,060
fact that Jocko has his own store.
It's called Jocko store.

1452
01:31:27,470 --> 01:31:32,130
Let's go to Jocko store.com for these
items. It's where you can get rash guards.

1453
01:31:32,131 --> 01:31:34,710
You can definitely get rash
guards. Yes. Get after it.

1454
01:31:36,490 --> 01:31:40,800
T shirts, a bunch of t shirts. Yeah. The
ones that say discipline equals freedom.

1455
01:31:40,801 --> 01:31:45,710
New Tee shirt coming. New t shirts
are coming. T shirts with Pearl.

1456
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:50,850
Yeah. Oh Dang. Two of them if, yeah, if
you're just sitting in the tee shirts,

1457
01:31:51,330 --> 01:31:55,560
discipline equals freedom.
It's a good one. I get

1458
01:31:57,090 --> 01:32:02,090
revealed how deep the expression
discipline equals freedom goes like almost

1459
01:32:03,911 --> 01:32:08,110
Dayton. That not daily, but let's
you understand it at a deep level,

1460
01:32:08,111 --> 01:32:11,350
a deeper level presented to reveal
to you how important it is, how much,

1461
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:14,800
even more than I previously thought
the week before. Yeah. Okay.

1462
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:18,500
It's almost like it has no, no limit
to the layers. It's pretty important.

1463
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:20,530
You don't actually,

1464
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:24,970
I've been sporting this
one equals freedom hat,

1465
01:32:25,210 --> 01:32:26,170
the trucker hat

1466
01:32:28,150 --> 01:32:32,700
and I also have the deaf beanie.
Get some.

1467
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:37,970
Yeah, that's a good one. So you've got
that those are available check. Yup. Um,

1468
01:32:38,110 --> 01:32:40,780
yes and also hoodies,

1469
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:45,580
heavy hoodies and lighten hoodies. I
know, bro. I know and I, and I know,

1470
01:32:45,670 --> 01:32:47,660
but I haven't been getting uh,

1471
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:50,890
feedback online and offline by the way,

1472
01:32:51,550 --> 01:32:53,970
for the light Hoodie.

1473
01:32:56,280 --> 01:33:00,500
They want the light Hoodie, man. They want
to represent. You know, like I said, Paul,

1474
01:33:00,501 --> 01:33:04,950
why I'm telling you there,
there are times maybe to Hawaii,

1475
01:33:05,290 --> 01:33:09,610
all of them, everybody and all the
Ohana and Hawaii is hitting you up.

1476
01:33:09,650 --> 01:33:14,620
The caught my eye enough and because
in Hawaii and other places here,

1477
01:33:14,670 --> 01:33:16,810
let's face it, there are
times where it's like, hey,

1478
01:33:16,811 --> 01:33:21,610
like yesterday was one of them. It's like,
Bro, it's kind of, it's kind of cold,

1479
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:25,000
but it's not cold. It's kind of cool if
you wear a tee shirt, it's like, man,

1480
01:33:25,001 --> 01:33:29,320
this environment,
weather is

1481
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:35,980
not feed mills go deaf
core, negative, negative.

1482
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:37,840
Nope.
That's not to me,

1483
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:43,140
especially if you're at like a
little gathering social situation,

1484
01:33:43,950 --> 01:33:48,730
maybe it could be looked at as paramount.
But here's what it is. If, if the,

1485
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:49,780
if the weather,

1486
01:33:50,170 --> 01:33:55,170
whatever environment is offering
slight discomfort hard right now,

1487
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:59,710
because everything you're saying is
things that I wouldn't allow myself or

1488
01:33:59,711 --> 01:34:04,560
anyone in my immediate family.
Just admit it doesn't make it,

1489
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:10,700
it doesn't make it any more true.
That's the thing. So Hey, look at me.

1490
01:34:10,701 --> 01:34:15,620
You were cruising right outside. Maybe
not you. I mean, I don't think you do.

1491
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:19,800
I don't think you do. That's the
thing. If me and Dave worked for that,

1492
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:23,860
maybe he'd want them and yet it's
maybe three degrees too cold.

1493
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:27,550
Yeah, you can suck it up. But what,

1494
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:30,940
why you got to endure discomfort
at times when it's not necessary.

1495
01:34:30,970 --> 01:34:34,270
Unless you're exercising your tolerance
for discomfort. You shouldn't be,

1496
01:34:34,271 --> 01:34:37,600
which you should add all point at all
times. That's what you're saying. Okay.

1497
01:34:37,601 --> 01:34:39,340
Me and date of birth,
we don't agree with this.

1498
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:44,580
So you put on a regular hoodie or heavy
or even a medium Hoodie after what?

1499
01:34:44,861 --> 01:34:49,270
Five minutes? Six minutes. We worked
out earlier today. Whatever that he,

1500
01:34:49,271 --> 01:34:52,870
it's too hot. So thick Hoodie,
too hot. No hoodie to Colt.

1501
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:58,940
Boom. Light Hoodie. Perfect. Because you
didn't know about that. Perfection. Uh,

1502
01:34:59,420 --> 01:35:03,410
dichotomy. Men, you know the zone balanced
the zones. Okay. Anyway, light Hoodie.

1503
01:35:03,830 --> 01:35:07,580
Discipline equals freedom.
That's the freedom part. Boom.

1504
01:35:07,670 --> 01:35:10,310
How about that women's stuff as well,
by the way,

1505
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:13,790
women's tee shirts
specifically for the ladies

1506
01:35:15,770 --> 01:35:18,680
and tank tops. Boom. Rash guards
are kind of for everybody. So boom,

1507
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:23,900
you can also subscribe to this podcast
on Itunes, Google play, stitcher,

1508
01:35:23,990 --> 01:35:24,830
leave reviews.

1509
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:30,080
So I can read them and laugh because you
guys are really good at writing a good

1510
01:35:30,081 --> 01:35:35,030
code reviews that cracked me up, so
thank you for that. Stitchers won't,

1511
01:35:35,031 --> 01:35:38,230
by the way, don't forget about the
youtube. You can subscribe to Youtube too,

1512
01:35:39,170 --> 01:35:43,650
and that's where you'll see echo
Charles is videos. Sure. That's,

1513
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:46,250
we'll say you've got some skills in life.

1514
01:35:46,940 --> 01:35:51,560
That's one of your Paramount's
skills. Making cool videos. Cool.

1515
01:35:51,561 --> 01:35:55,520
Agree or disagree? Yeah.
Oh sure. That's not good.

1516
01:35:55,521 --> 01:35:58,220
I'm putting you on the spot to not
be humble, so I wouldn't do that.

1517
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:03,520
Echo makes good videos and they're on
youtube and you subscribe to the channel

1518
01:36:05,540 --> 01:36:08,410
toggles podcasts, youtube
channel. Okay, well there you go.

1519
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:10,070
Very easy to find for basic,

1520
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:13,850
very subscribe bubble anyway.
Yeah,

1521
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,990
good way to support for sure. Also
some excerpts on there. You know,

1522
01:36:17,991 --> 01:36:20,660
little lessons from this podcast directly.

1523
01:36:21,390 --> 01:36:23,420
And so sometimes you
don't want to listen to,

1524
01:36:23,540 --> 01:36:28,160
let's say you listen to podcast
number 101 and you're like, hey,

1525
01:36:28,161 --> 01:36:31,610
there's some good stuff in there, but
should I listen to the whole, you know,

1526
01:36:31,611 --> 01:36:34,430
however many hours of the podcast for
that one lesson that I want to kind of

1527
01:36:34,431 --> 01:36:38,510
revisit? Should you do that? Hmm. Some
of us don't have that kind of time,

1528
01:36:38,570 --> 01:36:41,990
so I'm going to put out some excerpts
from all the podcasts, most of them.

1529
01:36:42,170 --> 01:36:45,920
So you go on there, subscribe and get
a little alert when we put one up,

1530
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:48,170
if that's the one you want to
listen to, boom, listened to it.

1531
01:36:48,171 --> 01:36:52,760
Good way to support too,
by the way. Also on it,

1532
01:36:53,930 --> 01:36:57,980
on it.com/chocolate this is
where I get all my kettle bells.

1533
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:01,430
I won't say all my socks, but a lot of
socks. That's where I get them from.

1534
01:37:01,431 --> 01:37:04,700
I know it sounds weird, but
man, it's one of those things.

1535
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:06,830
Sometimes you appreciate
the socks you're wearing,

1536
01:37:06,860 --> 01:37:08,990
especially when you're going
through the airport. Tsa, boom,

1537
01:37:08,991 --> 01:37:11,900
you gotta take off your shoes. Boom.
Hit them with the Onnit socks. Anyway,

1538
01:37:12,590 --> 01:37:17,090
fitness gear mainly. I think
that's, that's what I go
and for the information too,

1539
01:37:17,510 --> 01:37:20,720
by the way, like kettle bells, when I
started kettlebells, I heard good things.

1540
01:37:20,810 --> 01:37:24,320
You know I started the kettle bells.
They're kind of, they're intimidating.

1541
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:25,101
So boom,

1542
01:37:25,101 --> 01:37:30,101
going on it.com they have all the info
on their little things about form little

1543
01:37:30,561 --> 01:37:33,860
workouts. Really good. Good on Macy's too.

1544
01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:37,070
Are they called battle Macy's?
Just Macy's.

1545
01:37:37,710 --> 01:37:41,450
They're steel sticks,
clubs,

1546
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:45,590
clubs that look like, you
know the juggling clubs but
they haven't stayed there.

1547
01:37:46,220 --> 01:37:49,220
You can't juggle them. That's the thing.
If you could juggle those you'd be,

1548
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:54,290
you'd be a complete bad ass juggle. Those
20 pounders, they're freaking heavy.

1549
01:37:54,430 --> 01:37:58,630
Yeah. And they're heavier than
they sound. When you say 20 pounds,

1550
01:38:00,940 --> 01:38:05,190
they're heavy. The only way they're
20 pounds, only way they're even,

1551
01:38:05,191 --> 01:38:09,030
they can even justify saying 20 pounds
is when you actually put them on the

1552
01:38:09,031 --> 01:38:12,490
scale and the number it happened cause
it says 20 otherwise it's not 20 things.

1553
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:16,350
They were not made out of metal, but some,
you know, something from outer space.

1554
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:19,110
If you brought him to the airport
and you know when you're checking in,

1555
01:38:19,170 --> 01:38:23,040
you know and you put the your luggage on
the scale and you know you were pushing

1556
01:38:23,041 --> 01:38:27,000
it, you know that it may be over 50
pounds and you're like nervous, right,

1557
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:29,430
and then it doesn't hit 50 bucks.
If you've got that,

1558
01:38:29,431 --> 01:38:31,890
Macy had that Mason your hand,
you're about to put that on the scale.

1559
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:36,120
You know this is going over.
I'm paying that extra overage fee.

1560
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:40,350
That's what it feels like. I'm sorry.
As far as the mace goes anyway,

1561
01:38:40,470 --> 01:38:43,380
it happens to be a good thing to work
out with, but you grabbed that thing.

1562
01:38:43,381 --> 01:38:45,240
You'd be like, okay, what kind
of workout? I'm going to do this.

1563
01:38:45,270 --> 01:38:49,590
Boom on it.com/chocolate look
up the workout. You got it.

1564
01:38:49,650 --> 01:38:51,330
Also psychological warfare.

1565
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:56,280
It's an album that has various
tracks on it that you can

1566
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:02,010
play to push you through
moments of weakness and we are,

1567
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:07,460
we are formulating psychological
warfare to all your excuses are lies.

1568
01:39:07,561 --> 01:39:10,770
Yes, it will work your working
title, working title, working title,

1569
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:15,240
but it's pretty good title. Also
Jocko white tea. Here's the thing.

1570
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:19,650
I'm a tea drinker. No, I don't know if you
know that. I'm a tea drinker right now.

1571
01:39:19,651 --> 01:39:23,550
I drink tea regularly. I think that's
kind of all it takes really. But

1572
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:28,530
there was a whole thing I didn't realize,

1573
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:33,680
I didn't know that tea drinker had like
some stereotypical thing behind it.

1574
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:39,120
So when I came schema white teeth
people are like, oh that's really weird.

1575
01:39:39,121 --> 01:39:40,350
But you'd make tea cause they think I'd,

1576
01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:45,650
I'd be making what else Malki yeah they
think I'd make more but they wouldn't

1577
01:39:46,831 --> 01:39:49,920
think of you don't strike me as a teacher.
I didn't realize that.

1578
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:54,270
So I guess we're changing the paradigm
and those stereotypes come will not be

1579
01:39:54,271 --> 01:39:58,410
expected and accepted anymore.
Agree. I drink tea and I'm proud.

1580
01:39:58,710 --> 01:40:01,110
Maybe you're changing,
you're just evolving.

1581
01:40:01,111 --> 01:40:03,550
The stereotype may because
you are a tea drinker.

1582
01:40:03,551 --> 01:40:06,310
I'll straight up and
drinking tea since day.

1583
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:10,240
Not really since day one but since
I figured out what the day to day.

1584
01:40:10,670 --> 01:40:14,910
There you go. Boom. Yeah. So
Jocko White Tea, pomegranate,

1585
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:18,290
all organic certified by the way,
cause you know Jock,

1586
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:22,830
who cares about that kind of stuff in
the bags and in the camp. Big Deal.

1587
01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:26,180
I most tea drinkers care about certified
organic I think. Yeah, like it.

1588
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:30,540
Well that's another stereotype.
So Gmo tea, no good. No good.

1589
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:34,740
Will Not put that in my body. The
temple. Yeah, you're right. I agree.

1590
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:38,970
You get on Amazon and in fact I think
that's the only place you can get it.

1591
01:40:39,330 --> 01:40:42,810
Well it is the only place you get
it right now. And important fact,

1592
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:47,870
there's dry white tea that you put in
a brew and then there's the new thing,

1593
01:40:48,510 --> 01:40:49,800
which is an a can.
Yeah.

1594
01:40:49,801 --> 01:40:54,130
That's the one thing that's fired up
right now is people that are replacing the

1595
01:40:54,131 --> 01:40:58,570
12 are not the 12th but they're
replacing the four energy drinks,

1596
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:02,890
which actually gives you no energy that
actually SAP your energy and crush your

1597
01:41:02,891 --> 01:41:06,400
soul and turn you into a health disaster.

1598
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:11,320
People are replacing that crap
with Jocko white tea. Yeah.

1599
01:41:11,470 --> 01:41:14,920
In a can. One day it's going to be
everywhere. That's my suspicion.

1600
01:41:15,250 --> 01:41:17,950
You're just going to be and
people will just be, well,

1601
01:41:17,951 --> 01:41:21,460
you know the little Jocko white tea
on, you know, speaking of Oh yeah.

1602
01:41:21,461 --> 01:41:24,610
And also available in Canada.
I know a lot of Canadian folks say,

1603
01:41:24,611 --> 01:41:28,600
witness this stuff. Why can't I get up
here? So it's now available Amazon Canada.

1604
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:32,740
I'm going to put it on the
store too. Okay. And I've
been working on it, you know,

1605
01:41:32,741 --> 01:41:36,670
and we're almost there. So check
back with the store Taco store. Okay.

1606
01:41:36,910 --> 01:41:39,310
That's a good place to happen.
They can get the t wherever.

1607
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,920
I don't care if you're in wafer
for chocolate products are sold.

1608
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:46,690
That's where they're sold.
Uh, speaking of Amazon books,

1609
01:41:47,770 --> 01:41:50,230
I got some books. Good. Yeah. One,

1610
01:41:51,010 --> 01:41:55,900
two are called the way of the word
kit where the worry kid from wimpy to

1611
01:41:55,901 --> 01:41:58,930
warrior, right? That's the, what do
you call it after the colon? That part,

1612
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:01,420
that's the subtitle. Escher.
There it is. Wouldn't be to work.

1613
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:03,220
And then the second one is Mark's mission.

1614
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:09,520
Really clever evolution of
problems to be solved in both.

1615
01:42:09,550 --> 01:42:13,120
So now you have the ethos.
Okay. So, hi, I did it.

1616
01:42:13,150 --> 01:42:17,530
Do it is I read the first one and I
just keep repeating to my kids kids,

1617
01:42:17,531 --> 01:42:20,590
five, my daughter, oldest
five before bedtime,

1618
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:23,920
boom and then repeating now
got two in the rotation. Boom,

1619
01:42:23,921 --> 01:42:28,180
so you can the chronological,
right, boom. It is good.

1620
01:42:28,420 --> 01:42:30,760
Very clever.
Very on.

1621
01:42:30,761 --> 01:42:33,580
What do you call it when
you assume something about
somebody and it reveals that

1622
01:42:33,581 --> 01:42:37,850
there's more to this person. Oh,
so you assumed I was capable.

1623
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:43,840
Very incapable, but
yeah, that's a good one.

1624
01:42:43,990 --> 01:42:48,610
Also the discipline equals freedom field.
Manual field manual.

1625
01:42:48,690 --> 01:42:52,300
Best kind of manual in my opinion,
but this is like a manual for life.

1626
01:42:52,330 --> 01:42:56,530
I think it's like a ray basic
backbone for life. It is. Start there.

1627
01:42:56,531 --> 01:42:57,640
You'll be cubic solid.

1628
01:42:57,700 --> 01:43:01,730
I'm always stoked when I meet someone
that's comes up and it's like,

1629
01:43:02,810 --> 01:43:07,660
yeah, I'm on the path and like they're
not kidding. They're on the path.

1630
01:43:07,780 --> 01:43:10,950
Yeah. Crack that thing
open. Read two pages. Yeah.

1631
01:43:11,620 --> 01:43:14,920
Read two pages to prep
mentally for the day.

1632
01:43:15,130 --> 01:43:19,000
It will have impact and if you want to
listen to those pages is not available on

1633
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:23,500
audible. It's available
on iTunes, Amazon music,

1634
01:43:23,501 --> 01:43:27,490
Google play as an MP, three album with
tracks. That's where you can get it.

1635
01:43:27,491 --> 01:43:30,660
Of course you can also get extreme
ownership, extreme ownership,

1636
01:43:30,661 --> 01:43:33,880
but you can get the the the hardcover book

1637
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:35,313
[inaudible]

1638
01:43:36,230 --> 01:43:37,960
and you can also get the auto.

1639
01:43:38,030 --> 01:43:42,380
That one you can get the audible version
and the audible version is Lafe and I

1640
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:43,333
reading

1641
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:45,333
that book,

1642
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:52,070
that's who's reading it, that's who's
doing the narration. And then also Lafe

1643
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:54,920
and I have a book called
the dichotomy of leadership,

1644
01:43:55,340 --> 01:43:58,400
which I talk about dichotomy
all the time on this podcast.

1645
01:43:58,910 --> 01:44:03,720
The reason I talk about is cause it's
hard to, I won't even say master,

1646
01:44:03,721 --> 01:44:05,490
it's hard to even get a
grip on that dichotomy,

1647
01:44:05,580 --> 01:44:07,290
the different dichotomies
inside of leadership.

1648
01:44:07,860 --> 01:44:12,860
And so Lafe and I knew that we had
to go into a more granular level of

1649
01:44:13,141 --> 01:44:16,950
explanation of the dichotomy of leadership
and that's what this new book is.

1650
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:22,100
It comes out September 25th and also
for Leadership Training live inside your

1651
01:44:24,211 --> 01:44:26,310
organization,
whatever that organization might be.

1652
01:44:26,910 --> 01:44:30,480
Check out my company Ashkelon
Front leadership consulting.

1653
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:34,590
We solve problems through leadership.
That's that.

1654
01:44:35,430 --> 01:44:40,430
We have one more muster in 2018 the
muster is a leadership conference.

1655
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:46,230
We have one more in 2018
it is in San Francisco,

1656
01:44:46,231 --> 01:44:51,231
October 17th and 18th October 17th and
18th all the other ones that we've done

1657
01:44:52,170 --> 01:44:55,410
have sold out.
If you want to come get your ticket,

1658
01:44:55,710 --> 01:45:00,710
you can get an extreme ownership.com and
also for current uniformed personnel.

1659
01:45:00,991 --> 01:45:05,070
So people in the military, law
enforcement, border patrol,
firefighters, paramedics,

1660
01:45:05,071 --> 01:45:05,910
first responders,

1661
01:45:05,911 --> 01:45:10,911
we have roll call number one
September 21st in Dallas,

1662
01:45:11,071 --> 01:45:12,930
Texas.
That's also,

1663
01:45:13,290 --> 01:45:18,290
you can also register for that extreme
ownership.com that's one day focused on

1664
01:45:19,140 --> 01:45:21,660
the dynamic leadership environment.

1665
01:45:21,830 --> 01:45:26,830
So it's like a muster more focused
on the issues of first responders.

1666
01:45:27,940 --> 01:45:32,280
Essentially functional. It's
luster, it's a mustard shorter,

1667
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:34,470
it's a shorter muster,
it's more focused,

1668
01:45:34,590 --> 01:45:39,510
it's a cheaper price point and
it's one day. There's less,

1669
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:43,950
uh, amenities, right? So
when you come to the muster,

1670
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:49,080
everything's kind of kind of decked out
like the, the lunch meals. Really good.

1671
01:45:49,450 --> 01:45:53,970
The danger is great. It's like decked
out. It's taken to the highest level.

1672
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:57,300
The, the roll call is like, Hey,

1673
01:45:57,301 --> 01:45:59,760
we're here to get the information
out to people that need it.

1674
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:02,660
People that are in the field every day,
whether it's in the military,

1675
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:05,500
whether it's on the beat as a cop,
whether it's a firefighter, you know,

1676
01:46:05,550 --> 01:46:09,540
for people that are on the job,
people in uniform that we try and support,

1677
01:46:10,350 --> 01:46:13,500
they need this leadership training.
They asked for this leadership training.

1678
01:46:13,770 --> 01:46:15,540
We needed to do it at
a cheaper price point.

1679
01:46:15,541 --> 01:46:18,140
Where can we save money and still get
it done. There you go. That's what the,

1680
01:46:18,141 --> 01:46:19,040
that's what the roll call is,

1681
01:46:19,090 --> 01:46:22,620
but it's the same deal as far
as as an old backstage. Oh No.

1682
01:46:23,670 --> 01:46:28,470
The game talking to everybody the whole
day. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll be there.

1683
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:31,100
No Green Room.
Okay.

1684
01:46:31,890 --> 01:46:33,750
And until we do see you

1685
01:46:35,630 --> 01:46:40,630
big time at either the muster or the
roll call or the immersion camp in Maine,

1686
01:46:41,150 --> 01:46:44,480
if you want to roll with us virtually,

1687
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:50,200
we are all up on the interwebs on
Twitter and Instagram and dodge faci

1688
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:55,740
echo was that equity Carlson.

1689
01:46:55,741 --> 01:47:00,741
I am at jockowillink and to those of you
in uniform that wear the cloth of the

1690
01:47:02,581 --> 01:47:04,020
nation without you,

1691
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:07,770
this podcast and our
freedom would not exist.

1692
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:12,630
So thank you to police, law
enforcement, firefighters, paramedics,

1693
01:47:12,631 --> 01:47:14,700
border patrol,
other first responders.

1694
01:47:14,730 --> 01:47:19,730
Thank you for keeping
us safe while we sleep

1695
01:47:21,860 --> 01:47:24,440
and also to those in uniform.

1696
01:47:24,441 --> 01:47:28,130
Thanks to your families
for their sacrifice.

1697
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:32,330
That is a hard job as well.
And to everyone else,

1698
01:47:34,070 --> 01:47:36,500
thanks for listening.
Thanks for supporting.

1699
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:41,800
Thanks for moving away from the
darkness and toward the light.

1700
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,200
Thanks for fighting. Thanks for
getting after it. And most of all,

1701
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:51,450
thanks for living.

1702
01:47:54,280 --> 01:47:57,940
So until next time,
this is echo and Jocko,

1703
01:47:59,390 --> 01:47:59,730
how.
