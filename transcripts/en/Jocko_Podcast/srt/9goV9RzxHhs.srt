00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,600
This is Jocko podcast number
87 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,090
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,720
I'd been away from infantry and from the
army I'd grown up in for far too long.

4
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:24,420
Walking through the gates of
Coleman barracks was stepping
into the welcome past.

5
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,780
The old army had not died after all.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,530
The 18th was military perfection.

7
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,390
Men stepped smartly across my tip,
meticulously kept the grounds,

8
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,250
starched uniforms, blue
infantry, scarves, dazzling,

9
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:45,750
shiny brass and boots,
snappy salutes and cheerful.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,800
Good afternoon,

11
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:51,150
sirs marked my journey to
the HBCU where I'd sign in.

12
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,500
The spirit of this fine unit
was already infecting me.

13
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,560
The hot stifling windless day,

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,880
the ragweed pollen that blew in from
adjacent fields covering the camp and

15
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:05,220
immediately activating my hay fever.

16
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:06,410
Okay.

17
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,170
The rundown boring camp itself,

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,080
none of it mattered as inwardly.

19
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:17,290
I was transported to an island
oasis on touched by turbulent seas.

20
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,350
Okay.

21
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,850
And it was all thanks to one man,

22
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:26,190
the battle group commanding officer
who would forever be my model,

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,100
mentor and friend,
Colonel Glover.

24
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:36,130
S Johns was the finest senior infantry
commander I'd ever seen or ever would see

25
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,593
again.

26
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,630
We shared a mutual abiding respect
almost from the moment we met.

27
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,780
He was my kind of soldier and I was his.

28
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,790
He was a warrior patents
aid before World War Two.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,050
Then during the war,

30
00:01:54,051 --> 00:01:58,490
he'd hit the beaches of Normandy as part
of the 29th division and fought from

31
00:01:58,491 --> 00:02:03,491
those bloody shores all the way across
Europe until victory was achieved as a

32
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,520
battalion commanding officer.
He had headed the task force,

33
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:10,700
the captured the critical
French town of St Lo

34
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,480
in Korea.
He'd served as executive officer,

35
00:02:15,481 --> 00:02:18,480
then regimental commander
in my own 40th division.

36
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,660
His reputation there was awesome.

37
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:27,710
One story that made its way through the
division was that a wild new XL had come

38
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:32,220
into the two to fourths, gotten down on
his belly in the mud to check the units,

39
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:34,140
machine guns,
field of fire,

40
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,370
and promptly moved two thirds of the
machine gun bunkers that had sat there for

41
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:39,300
two years.

42
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:40,660
Okay.

43
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,430
Later when he took over as commanding
officer of the two to 24th and the unit

44
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,140
move to a new sector,

45
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:52,290
he'd outpost to dispar about 200 yards
in front of one of his companies so the

46
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,040
North Koreans couldn't do at first

47
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,580
with this move was considered seizing
ground and against no when rules of the

48
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:05,611
war and soon the XCOR commanding general
flew down to John's position to discuss

49
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:11,050
the matter with him.
After exam examining the situation,

50
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,160
general white told him he could keep
the spur but was never to advance again

51
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:23,710
even his outpost line without
express permission from core

52
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,160
cause blue eyes sparkled like those of
a wise and truly tested man who'd long

53
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:34,770
since realized that humor could
be found in just about anything.

54
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,830
He had seen his share of horror,

55
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:43,910
his cheeks were rosy and the dueling
scar that crossed one of them and no way

56
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:48,120
detracted from his Jen rugged
yet gentle old soldier face.

57
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,630
Maybe the scar even enhanced it,
I don't know,

58
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:56,580
but it sure gave him more character
and provided a good yarn to boot.

59
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,760
In any event.
Colonel Glover,

60
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,690
s Johns was a 49 year old stud.

61
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:12,130
Colonel Johns was a basics
man and a total soldier.

62
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,840
He taught and insisted that his company
commanders teach things like terrain

63
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:17,800
appreciation,

64
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,390
the knowledge of which was a basic tool
of a soldier's trade to be able to look

65
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:26,200
at a piece of ground and appreciate the
slightest differences in the comm tour,

66
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,290
to notice how the ground
unfolds and be able to think.

67
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,450
There's cover over their cover.

68
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,390
The one essential providing protection
from direct enemy fire to recognize a

69
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:42,391
streamline of gully or treed area as an
avenue of approach through which a unit

70
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:47,230
could move unseen to understand and
identify the best ground from which to

71
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,890
launch or repel an attack.
Shoot,

72
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,660
scoot and communicate.

73
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,340
The morning battle drill
began with fire and maneuver.

74
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:02,640
One man firing while his buddy moved
a fire team moving wallets counterpart

75
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:08,470
fired colonel. John's likened it to a
fighter's bobbing, weaving and jabbing.

76
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,030
We kept the mythical enemy pinned down
while we jabbed our way to close on his

77
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:16,120
position.
That's covering move by the way.

78
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:23,310
The colonel was right there with us to
set the example and we did it until we

79
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:27,790
got it right.
We'd ended up black and blue running,

80
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,110
hating the ground and rolling into firing
position with full field equipment on

81
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,370
is not without pain,

82
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:39,250
but no one bitched because John's again
and again reinforced the simple equation.

83
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,160
The quicker you get to the ground
and you get your weapon to position,

84
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,270
the sooner you'll be delivering effective
fire on the enemy and the longer

85
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:49,630
you'll stay alive.
Still,

86
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,840
this truism was just one part of the
overall strive to better your best

87
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:59,390
philosophy.
That characterized the first,

88
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:04,391
the w of the 18th under Colonel Johns
and deputy commanding officer couch in

89
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,160
couches words.

90
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,540
It was our policy to encourage
excellence among the soldiers,

91
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,520
particularly in bayonet training,
unarmed combat shooting,

92
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,560
and total physical fitness.
This is what really makes a soldier.

93
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,730
If he masters masters these subjects,
he'll fight.

94
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,160
From my experience in Korea,
I could not have agreed more.

95
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,360
So that's a little opener
from a book called about face,

96
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,150
my favorite book by,
it's written by Colonel David Hackworth,

97
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:51,210
and he's talking about a guy that was his
commander in the early 1960s Hackworth

98
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:56,200
had gotten out of the army and then came
back in after a couple of years because

99
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,410
he realized to civilian life was not fun.

100
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:06,060
And so he came back in and
he got stationed in Germany
and this guy by the name

101
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:09,490
of colonel glove rest Johns,

102
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,180
who by the way,
he dead Hackworth the dedicates.

103
00:07:13,181 --> 00:07:16,300
He's dedicated the book to him for two
minutes and some other soldiers that he

104
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:18,610
worked with along the way. But
it's their Glover Johns. He says,

105
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,330
dedicated this book to Glover
Johnson who showed us how to lead.

106
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,593
Mm.

107
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,680
So Glover,
John's outstanding combat leader.

108
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:33,640
And luckily we can all learn from Glover.

109
00:07:33,641 --> 00:07:38,641
John's not only from what he passes
through Hackworth in Hackworth book,

110
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,040
but also from his own book club rest.

111
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:50,041
John's wrote his own book called the
Clay Pigeons of St Lo about his push from

112
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,780
Norman d and across France
that Hackworth just referenced.

113
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:04,050
Now, it's interesting when we go into this
book, the Clay Pigeons, the St Lo, he,

114
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,420
he writes the book in the third person

115
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,880
and he says that it was just easier
for him to write it that way.

116
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:15,610
So in other words, he's, he doesn't
say, I did this and I did that. He says,

117
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:18,280
Major Johns did this and major
dog John said something else.

118
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,260
But what's interesting is he said that
one of the reasons he was able to,

119
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,380
one of the reasons that he did that was
because the guy that was commanding in

120
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:29,950
combat was a battalion
commander and comment was
different from his normal self.

121
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,150
And so we had this combat
John's combat Glover,

122
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:37,810
John's that was out there leading
things and he had normal John's.

123
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,020
That was the way he lived his normal life.

124
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:45,850
But it was easier for him to write and
more natural for him to write about this

125
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:48,220
major John's guy in the third person.

126
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,870
And he also likes it
cause it can gives him,

127
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,280
it gives me the ability to kind of detach
from it and explain what was going on.

128
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,820
So when you hear it,

129
00:08:56,821 --> 00:09:01,020
it's all about major John's instead
of being about me and about I,

130
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,670
but it's, it's him and even though
it's written from the third person,

131
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:10,671
it is absolutely a first person account
from a battalion commander in combat,

132
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,510
close,
intense combat,

133
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,180
and let's pick it up.
Going to the book,

134
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,550
the Clay Pigeons of St Lo.

135
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,660
Here we go. Sharp ballistic cracks
pounded his ear drum so rapidly.

136
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:40,020
They seemed like one impossibly
prolonged rifle shot.

137
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,930
He was instantly paralyzed with
overwhelming fright. The radio operator,

138
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:47,520
Jimmy slumped forward at his feet.

139
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,580
Another man stumbled pass to
fall into the ditch ahead.

140
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,230
Then Newcome cleared the eight foot
hedgerow apparently with one jump,

141
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,890
but the major was too shocked to move.

142
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,740
His stomach knotted
itself into a tight ball.

143
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,030
It jammed against his pounding heart
while his breath stopped completely for an

144
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:06,864
instant,

145
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:11,580
then came and Jerky gasps
the hair on his head,

146
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:14,610
felt as if it were rising
like the hair on a cat's back,

147
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,410
his skin prickled all over.

148
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,690
But the most awful thing was the
cold empty feeling in his guts.

149
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,800
The burst of German machine
gun fire lasted only seconds,

150
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,580
but it seemed like a lifetime before
he could reach up and snatch or grenade

151
00:10:29,581 --> 00:10:30,540
from his pistol belt.

152
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,730
He'd never heard a bullet
crack by inches from his head.

153
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,860
He didn't know they sounded like that.

154
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,300
He thought there was a German with a burp
pistol behind the nearest tree on top

155
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:44,610
of a hedge row.
He grabbed the pin on the grenade,

156
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,460
but before he could throw it
something made him stop and yell.

157
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:51,510
Anybody on the other side, he
got a quick answer. Hell yes.

158
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,970
Before he could lower his arm.

159
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,840
The blast of a rifle right
in his lap made him flinch.

160
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,200
He squirmed back even closer
against the hedge row.

161
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,050
As Martin and grim cell went into action,

162
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:10,190
they'd been at the front all 11 days
since a continuous line had been

163
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:15,750
established in Normandy. The crack
of bullets was nothing new to them,

164
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,320
almost side by side,
lying flat and the ditch.

165
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,860
They fired methodically across
him and over Jimmy's head.

166
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,080
Mechanically. He checked the pin in
the grenade then still a little dazed,

167
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,540
hooked it back onto his belt harnessed.

168
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,450
He looked at the man who had fallen in
the ditch and now was trying to weekly

169
00:11:37,451 --> 00:11:40,690
push himself up.
It was Lieutenant Sadler,

170
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,420
his face already greenish gray with shock.

171
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:47,200
He had been hit five or six
times in the head, chest,

172
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,840
and both arms major.

173
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:53,110
John's knew instinctively that
Sadler was as good as dead.

174
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,230
He called to him to lie,
steal and take it easy.

175
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,040
But the Charlie company commander
was already beyond hearing.

176
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,150
John's felt that he ought to
do something constructive,

177
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,330
something to get their minds off
the tragedy that had just struck,

178
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,950
but it was without
inspiration merely numb.

179
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,900
Hey, you guys yelled grizzle.
Let's Scram Outta here.

180
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,860
That brought the commander out of
the days he had been in ever since.

181
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:22,540
The deafening burst of enemy fire,

182
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,190
perhaps two minutes before he leaned
forward and shook Jimmy Shoulder. Come on,

183
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:29,200
Jim.
It's all over now you can get up.

184
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,870
Jimmy didn't move major.
John's shook him again.

185
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,780
Then he saw blood oozing slowly,
thickly, brightly across his own shoe.

186
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:46,130
Gently. He pulled a Jimmy's
far shoulder, a neat,

187
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,340
clean little bullet hole in the
boy's helmet came into view.

188
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,700
So the major knew that Jimmy was dead.

189
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,310
Something impelled him to pull Jimmy
over until he could look into his face.

190
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:04,310
The eyes were closed and an odd little
half smile made Jimmy look as if he were

191
00:13:04,311 --> 00:13:07,190
asleep.
Dreaming Pleasant Dreams.

192
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:14,060
Slowly the major lowered him back to
the ground and for a fleeting instant

193
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,620
watched Jimmy's lifeblood
continued to flow across his shoe.

194
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,573
So

195
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:39,340
that's his really his
first experience in combat.

196
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,470
And you can see,
obviously it's,

197
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:50,330
it's a hell of a wake up call.
And the whole book,

198
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:55,680
the whole book is like this. It's
an, it's an incredible book. The,

199
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:01,750
the way he describes the battles and
how they're laid out and the way he lays

200
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:07,580
out his own thoughts and what's
going on. It's just a, it's, it's an,

201
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,790
it's an outstanding book and it's
one of these books where as I had to

202
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,250
consciously say to myself, okay, Jocko,

203
00:14:13,251 --> 00:14:17,840
you cannot read this whole book
on the podcast. We need to,

204
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,090
you know,
people need to read it for themselves.

205
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,150
But the book is that the
description of combat like that,

206
00:14:23,151 --> 00:14:25,400
that opening is phenomenal.

207
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:32,110
So let's go back to the book now where
that first battle is over and he's having

208
00:14:35,571 --> 00:14:38,390
some thoughts here. We go back
to the book. As he walked,

209
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,320
he couldn't keep his thoughts away from
the hot spot he'd been in a few minutes

210
00:14:42,321 --> 00:14:45,950
before and the lessons he learned
so quickly, but it's such a price.

211
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,250
In little more than an
hour of his first fight,

212
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,400
he lost two company to radio operators
and three other men besides just escaping

213
00:14:56,121 --> 00:15:00,710
death himself. As he thought about the
crack of those machine gun bullets,

214
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,760
his stomach began to score him
again until by a conscious effort.

215
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:06,320
He forced it to behave.

216
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,810
He couldn't understand why he
hadn't been hit to Jimmy's head.

217
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:18,020
Had been not more than two feet from
his own Newcomb and the front and Sadler

218
00:15:18,811 --> 00:15:20,610
directly behind him had been hit.

219
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,710
The whole burst must've missed
him by scan inches. He decided,

220
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,160
and he very seriously
thank God for his safety.

221
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,860
At the same time,

222
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,480
he promised never again to risk the
lives of others if he could avoid it.

223
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:42,520
It was a bitter lesson repeated every
time the eyes of his mind focused on

224
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:47,080
Jimmy's bright blood oozing over
a shoe or on Sadler. Sudden death.

225
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,140
He looked down at the shoe,

226
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:55,120
shuttered at the still red stain and
tried to scuff it off on the grass

227
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,510
on his way to the regimental command post,

228
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,870
the major passed a
knocked out Sherman tank.

229
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,940
What distinguished this?

230
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:09,941
Smoking Brown hoke from others he had
seen that day was the single blackened

231
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:15,170
claw like hand and forearm that was
thrust out of the turret turret toward the

232
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:16,004
sky.

233
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:22,170
The fingers were separate and more
than half curled like the talent of a

234
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:27,060
striking eagle,
but there's hand was not striking.

235
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:33,050
It seemed rather to be calling down an
implication on the fate that it let it

236
00:16:34,231 --> 00:16:37,440
die there in agony.

237
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,960
So now he gets to the
regimental commander. Well,
boom, the regimental commander,

238
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,410
what's going on?
I've just been trying to get to you.

239
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,260
John saluted it as he answered,
sir,

240
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,100
we're stuck at the second hedge row and
I had to use my reserve to protect my

241
00:16:54,101 --> 00:16:54,934
flanks.

242
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,720
It doesn't look as if we'll get to the
forge today unless we have better luck

243
00:16:58,721 --> 00:17:02,260
later.
Have many casualties.

244
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:06,310
I Dunno about the companies yet because
I haven't had any reports from them

245
00:17:06,311 --> 00:17:09,250
except the yells about their
flanks and counter attacks.

246
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,880
But nab was wounded early Sadler is dead,

247
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:18,030
and I've lost two operators besides
three other men out of my own CP group.

248
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,160
He was still too full of his experience
not to want to tell about it.

249
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:28,050
The colonel listen sympathetically.
Well, he said when the major was through,

250
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,810
we've got to keep going regardless.

251
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,550
Division wants to get the forge tonight.

252
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,340
So yeah, you just had that rough
day. First Day of combat. Guess what?

253
00:17:41,341 --> 00:17:43,790
We're still going at it.
You know,

254
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:47,340
one of the things that in that opening
paragraph that I pointed out was you

255
00:17:47,341 --> 00:17:50,100
could see his reaction when
that first fight broke out.

256
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,790
His reaction was sort of overwhelming,

257
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:57,690
overwhelmed by the whole scenario. But
it's two guys. And what happened is,

258
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:01,710
and you know he talks about this in the
book, but he had gone on the Normandy,

259
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,990
but he wasn't in charge
of a battalion yet.

260
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:08,991
He was sort of a back with the regimental
command and then one of the battalion

261
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:12,930
commanders was out of the fight and I
forget if the battalion commander was

262
00:18:12,931 --> 00:18:14,310
killed or wounded,

263
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:18,900
but he went and took this battalion
commander's job so he wasn't on the real

264
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:23,520
front lines until they were starting
to push through France a little bit.

265
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,730
Then it was only a matter of days.
But these,

266
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,510
well I guess it was 11
days cause these guys are,

267
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,080
he said that these other guys had
been on the front lines for 11 days.

268
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:35,640
So these guys, it's been 11
days. But guess what, there
they start getting shot at,

269
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:36,960
boom, they're there, they're in the mode,

270
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:41,800
they're returning fire and you could
see they're returning fire. Really cool.

271
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:45,390
So close that it scared him.
And that's one of the things that,

272
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:46,861
you know,

273
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:50,580
a lot of times I talk about simunition
and training with simunition and how

274
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:52,770
awesome it is and,
and that's totally true.

275
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,270
And I love training with ammunition and
it really is very beneficial for your

276
00:18:57,271 --> 00:18:58,890
tactical skill level,

277
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,910
but you also absolutely
have to do live fire.

278
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,380
And the reason you have to do live fire,

279
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,320
I mean there's a bunch of reasons
you have to do it. You know,

280
00:19:06,321 --> 00:19:11,250
you have to learn to shoot real bullets
and hit real targets or with your

281
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,084
bullets,

282
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:17,630
but also guns are loud and you need to
condition yourself to be used to having,

283
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:24,950
uh, uh, mark 48 machine gun,
four inches, maybe not forced,

284
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,960
but like 16 inches from your head and
your buddy is dumping rounds down range.

285
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:34,971
And you have to be able to think during
that and not be overwhelmed by it to the

286
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:37,680
simunition. That's one's an ass. Like how,

287
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:41,280
what's the difference in loudness
is not even comparable. So is it,

288
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,900
so it's not even really like not gun
shot? No, it's not like a gunshot.

289
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,110
It's not comparable. It's not,
the noise is not comparable.

290
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:50,180
The noises is less than a cap gun kind of.
Yeah.

291
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,880
Like an air soft gun is loud
and a mark 48 machine gun.

292
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,900
It's really that,
and it's sending little shockwaves.

293
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,100
Every round is like a little shock
that you get. And so that's why,

294
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,520
that's why it is so
important to train live fire.

295
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:09,960
And it's also important to be comfortable
not only yourself shooting in close

296
00:20:09,961 --> 00:20:14,160
proximity with other people,
but also them shooting near you.

297
00:20:14,161 --> 00:20:16,050
Cause you've got to trust
the guys that are around you.

298
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:21,600
Now there's standard operating procedures
that there's things that you don't do

299
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,670
that keep it safe, but it's still,
I mean, when somebody makes a bet,

300
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,980
if somebody makes a really bad mistake
and they can walk into your field of fire,

301
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,620
and so you have to be heads up,

302
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:36,450
but you still have to take shots with
people that are really close to you in a

303
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:38,820
firefight, by the way.
Well, yeah, in a firefight.

304
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,520
But if you haven't done it
during training, your first,

305
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,280
your first minute in a
firefight is going to be just,

306
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,740
just overwhelmed and you're not
gonna be overwhelmed by enemy fire.

307
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,210
You'd be overwhelmed by your own guy
shooting the mirror and you're going to be

308
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:57,060
hitting, getting hit by brass
and, and just, it hurts, Hon.

309
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,320
Yeah.
Hot Brass and the,

310
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:04,210
the links coming out of a mark 48
are like little weapons themselves.

311
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:06,880
And when they hit the, yeah, we had, uh,

312
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,230
one of our machine gunners was a lefty
and he picked up and started shooting who

313
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,430
he picked up that machine gun and started
shooting lefthanded and that dumps the

314
00:21:15,431 --> 00:21:20,290
brass basically right on your right bicep.
And he had a, he had a bruise on his,

315
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,090
on his right arm that looked like somebody
beat him with a baseball bat in the

316
00:21:25,091 --> 00:21:29,350
arm. That's what a mark 48
ejector port does to you.

317
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,820
It doesn't play around.
So again,

318
00:21:33,821 --> 00:21:35,770
going back to the situation
he's in right now, he's,

319
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,810
he's had all these casualties and they're
like the major says, Hey, yup. Uh,

320
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,610
regardless,
we've got to keep going,

321
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:47,890
which is w which is the
way war actually is.

322
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:54,190
So that night, um, he
has a little company,

323
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,700
little huddle with the company
commanders and you know, just to,

324
00:21:57,701 --> 00:22:00,970
just to kind of spell this out, if
you're wondering what this is all about.

325
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:05,920
So he's got the, he's a
battalion commander, so,

326
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,510
and if he's actually got this written
out in the book, but a Battalion Co,

327
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:13,120
a battalion in 1944 was about 900 guys,
900 men,

328
00:22:13,121 --> 00:22:16,720
28 officers.
You got three companies.

329
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,970
The three companies are broken
down into three platoons.

330
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,890
Each one of those platoons
has a platoon leader,

331
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:24,010
but each one of the companies has
a company commander, a captain.

332
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,150
And so that's what he's talking about.
So he,

333
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,940
so those are your kind of your hundred
and 50 men fighting elements are these

334
00:22:30,941 --> 00:22:34,210
companies with three platoons
in them of 50 people each about,

335
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,880
and it's weird because people
always think the military is,

336
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,540
everything's perfectly structured. But
actually this, this changes all the time,

337
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:44,760
not based on, but based on your
mission, you know, sometimes you,

338
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,730
you might have a platoon that needs
to get plussed up or a company that's

339
00:22:47,731 --> 00:22:51,880
shorter people. So there's no, there's
no consistent, just all the time number.

340
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,730
Let me see what he says. The actual number
that they were supposed to have in a,

341
00:22:54,731 --> 00:22:59,731
in a company at this time was each rifle
company was made up of six officers and

342
00:23:01,901 --> 00:23:05,470
186 men. That's what they
are supposed to have in them.

343
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:10,950
Now you're going to find out real quick
that they rarely have even close to a

344
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,810
hundred, but that's what they're
supposed to have. So at this point,

345
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:18,160
he's bringing in these three company
commanders to talk to them about kind of a

346
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:22,030
plan and also to get a debrief on,

347
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,640
on what happened during the day
and what they're planning to do.

348
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,470
Hat here we go back to the book.
He thought a moment, and this is,

349
00:23:29,471 --> 00:23:32,380
this is, uh, one of the company
commander's name, Lieutenant Ryan.

350
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,830
And he's talking and he says he
thought a moment and then added.

351
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,580
We might make it across the road if we
pour a lot of smoke and mortars into them

352
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,840
and then rush them,
but it'll take. But uh,

353
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,950
but it's getting awfully late to be
beating around in this kind of country.

354
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,420
So trying to figure out how to
move forward. And Lieutenant Ryan.

355
00:23:47,421 --> 00:23:49,640
That was kind of Lieutenant Ryan
suggestion. Let's mortar him,

356
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,490
put a bunch of smoke out and
then we can move, but guess what?

357
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:54,890
It's getting late and if we're
running around once it gets dark,

358
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:58,100
it's going to get scary.
Ryan stopped and looked at Kenny.

359
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,600
It was Kenny's turn and Kenny, you're
going to find out is a legit Badass.

360
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:04,820
Sir.

361
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,760
I only had a few minutes to look things
over before Wendell came along and he

362
00:24:07,761 --> 00:24:11,030
invited me back here to see you,
but that orchard is a terrible place.

363
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,060
No cover anywhere.
Machine guns covering every inch of it.

364
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,900
We lost a lot of men in there
the first time he paused,

365
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:23,210
but we'll do the best we
can. Well, rough or not,

366
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,850
we're going ahead.
The major stated flatly,

367
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,460
by the way,
Kenny just took over for,

368
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:36,370
for one of the company commanders
that had been a wounded or killed.

369
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:42,420
Now they start pushing and all of
a sudden they're pushing forward.

370
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,241
And again,

371
00:24:43,241 --> 00:24:47,830
I have to skip through this book and
I'm trying to highlight the leadership

372
00:24:47,831 --> 00:24:52,831
scenarios or the things that reveal
the way human beings react in hard

373
00:24:54,491 --> 00:24:58,930
situations.
But when you read this book yourself,

374
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,070
you can really follow the tactical
decision making process and also how the

375
00:25:03,071 --> 00:25:04,720
battles went and what happened.

376
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,930
Obviously I can't go through
the whole thing right now,

377
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:11,710
but at this point they had started
pressing and all of a sudden he sees guys

378
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,380
running away running.
So you know as the company commander,

379
00:25:14,381 --> 00:25:17,080
and he talks about this where he
positions himself and obviously he doesn't

380
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:19,150
position himself right on
the front with the platoons.

381
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,700
He's back a little bit at this point,
guys start,

382
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,530
he sees guys are running back towards him.

383
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:27,250
At first he thinks it might be Germans,
he's no, it's Americans, it's his guys.

384
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,770
And here we go back to the book.
That major got to his feet.

385
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,720
He started a crouching run to the left.

386
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,990
He had nearly reached the end of the
field when four or five men yelling,

387
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:38,560
don't shoot, don't shoot. Piled over
the hedge row. That's separated.

388
00:25:38,561 --> 00:25:40,000
Charlie and Baker companies.

389
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:43,960
He stopped car being alert
as he lowered his gun.

390
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,670
Wondering what this was all about.

391
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:49,570
A figure stepped out from the hedge
row and voiced the same question.

392
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:53,140
What's going on here anyway,
just what's this all about?

393
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,480
It was lieutenant I period.

394
00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:00,400
Arms spread wide to catch the running
men carbines slung over his soldier

395
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:02,710
shoulder.
The picture of calm.

396
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,560
He caught the leading man by his jacket,

397
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:09,860
which piled the others up in a
tight little, not the man pound.

398
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,970
Panted Krauts, paratroopers.
They're right behind us.

399
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:17,950
Run a period, glanced over
the man's shoulder. Unmoved.

400
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:22,120
Well, now I don't see
any crowds. Just look,

401
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,950
the men looked back.

402
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:27,730
All they could see were several
Charlie company men standing quietly.

403
00:26:27,731 --> 00:26:32,470
Rifles ready. The leader of the runaways
relaxed then shuttered violently.

404
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:37,180
I period went on. I don't think
there's any crowds chasing you at all.

405
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,500
Let's just go see about this.
The man tried to pull away
from him, but there were,

406
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,670
he cried.
There were,

407
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,500
I tell they came right over the hedgerow
and shot down right down the whole

408
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:50,190
squad. They got the sergeant and all
the rest. We're the only ones left.

409
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:54,780
They nearly got me. Look, he poked a
finger through a hole in his jacket,

410
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,273
but I period,

411
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:00,420
unimpressed moved in the direction of
Baker company even as the man protested

412
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,800
dragging him along while the
others followed meekly. Well,

413
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,730
I period went on,

414
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,240
let's just go see what captain
Weddell has to say about the Aldis.

415
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:15,180
He called softly to the men guarding
the company flank, see anything? No Sir.

416
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,190
The answer came back quickly and calmly.

417
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,450
The mortar observer and his little group
of panic stricken men disappeared over

418
00:27:21,451 --> 00:27:23,850
the head dro,
the major new.

419
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:28,290
He had just seen a wonderful example
of leadership at its very finest.

420
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,600
I period,
quickly,

421
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:35,220
calmly and efficiently had stopped
what could have been a route.

422
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,800
So one leader steps out
and really what he's doing,

423
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,710
if you think about it, he's detached
because he wasn't in that situation.

424
00:27:46,711 --> 00:27:49,770
Where do you need some Germans came over
and obviously shot at him more close

425
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:51,400
range, killed a couple of guys, you know,

426
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:55,350
would've would've wounded this soldier
who got shot through his jacket.

427
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,910
But he just gets, he kind of
gets the guy to detach, hey look,

428
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:04,350
there's no one there. Calm down. Let's
go have a look. Let's take a step back.

429
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:09,570
And that kind of calmness prevented
everyone cause cause what can go in the

430
00:28:09,571 --> 00:28:12,510
other direction, right? We can go the
other x. Do you see people running?

431
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,460
That's what happens.
You see people running,

432
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:17,940
you start running and you know that
that was very interesting in the,

433
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:22,320
in the, I don't know if you remember
some of those police shootings where,

434
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:27,720
I remember there's one in New York City
where something like 57 rounds were

435
00:28:27,721 --> 00:28:32,630
fired. It somebody that was
unarmed and everyone's going, why?

436
00:28:32,631 --> 00:28:37,140
Why was everyone shooting? And I'll
tell you what happens is, you know,

437
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:41,110
for some reason they think you think
somebody has a weapon or a suspect was

438
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:45,030
going to do something bad and now you've
got five or six people that are holding

439
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:48,930
a gun on him. Well, when
one's person started shooting,

440
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:53,580
when people are not attached and when
people are caught up in the moment,

441
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:58,260
everyone starts pulling
the trigger and it's, it's,

442
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,950
it can be really devastating. It
can be really devastating. Yeah,

443
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,510
so wait,

444
00:29:03,511 --> 00:29:07,740
but when people are used to that kind
of stress and they're calm and they're

445
00:29:07,741 --> 00:29:10,260
detached, one person takes a
shot, you, you, you actually,

446
00:29:10,261 --> 00:29:13,380
instead of just firing yourself,
you actually assess and say, okay,

447
00:29:13,381 --> 00:29:16,170
what is he shooting at? I
need to get cover. So there's,

448
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:21,060
that's why that training is so important
to get people at a high stress level

449
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:25,080
and still think through
things and still be detached.

450
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,200
The stress is going to be there,
put it in a box, monitor it,

451
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,050
don't get in it because you're
going to make bad decisions.

452
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,810
You might not make any decisions.
You might just go off of your reactions,

453
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,190
which are, I'm sitting
here with a gun. People are
shooting, I'm going to shoot to.

454
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,920
That's not, I mean it's like how
you say when you're not trained,

455
00:29:41,921 --> 00:29:44,690
you don't have experience in
those types of situations. Like A,

456
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,750
you're the shooting example.
It's,

457
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,960
it's one of those things where you see it
in Jujitsu when you started this exact,

458
00:29:49,961 --> 00:29:53,740
literally the exact same thing where, so
in a shooting situation, one guy shoots,

459
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:58,270
you hear the gunfire, basically
your brain just says, okay, it's on.

460
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:02,140
Yeah, it's a 100% let's go
a full speed. 100% it's on,

461
00:30:02,141 --> 00:30:06,970
you can't like gun shots are being fired.
It's not, not on. You got to go 100%.

462
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,220
So in Jujitsu,
when you first start,

463
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:12,130
you know how like the guys just
going full speed the whole time,

464
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:15,520
you're in a spot where it's like
you can't move here. You can't,

465
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:18,010
you're completely trapped right here.
Not some mission necessarily,

466
00:30:18,011 --> 00:30:22,240
but you're trapped and going crazy. You
know, just cause you don't know they,

467
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:25,430
it's on. It's either to honor, it's
not on. Yeah. So when you're drained,

468
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,040
what you're talking about is an
individual, individual moment.

469
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,870
What I'm talking about, his group, it's
a group think scenario where, you know,

470
00:30:34,871 --> 00:30:37,700
just like it happens when there's a,
uh,

471
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:40,810
a gunshot and everyone
starts running people.

472
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,400
But the people in the background don't
even know what they're running. Gosh,

473
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,210
I just see people running.
So they're running. Yeah,
yeah, yeah, that's true. Well,

474
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:47,350
you imagine how amped you are.

475
00:30:47,351 --> 00:30:49,090
You think there's a bad guy
in a dark alley and you're,

476
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,900
you're there with four your
police partners or your or your,

477
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,390
your military partners.

478
00:30:55,391 --> 00:30:58,450
You're looking down now you think there's
a insurgent there and all of a sudden

479
00:30:58,451 --> 00:31:02,110
around cracks off you're,
you're lucky. And there's a,

480
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,240
there's a situation that
happened where there,

481
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:08,350
where there was an Iraqi soldier that
had an accidental discharge and you know

482
00:31:08,351 --> 00:31:11,820
what that is like we like it
was laced platoon and layoffs,

483
00:31:11,821 --> 00:31:16,821
wave Splatoon was taken down a building
and I was actually outside the building,

484
00:31:18,131 --> 00:31:18,281
you know,

485
00:31:18,281 --> 00:31:22,180
cause we were taking out
multiple buildings but they
were in one building and

486
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:26,260
all of a sudden crack a couple rounds,
get shot off.

487
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:30,130
And you know what it was actually,
I'm pretty sure that it was,

488
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:34,330
I'm pretty sure Andrew Paul,
this is a whole cast of characters.

489
00:31:34,331 --> 00:31:37,390
I'm pretty sure Andrew Paul was at like
the head of the train or close to the

490
00:31:37,391 --> 00:31:41,440
front of the train in inside that they
were inside this building rounds get

491
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,650
fired. And Andrew Paul's
thinking, okay, I think,

492
00:31:44,651 --> 00:31:46,960
I think I remember Andrew Paul telling
me this angel Paul's like, okay,

493
00:31:46,961 --> 00:31:48,250
well we're going to grenade these.

494
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,650
We're going to throw frag grenades into
this next room cause people are shooting

495
00:31:50,651 --> 00:31:52,300
at us.
And it was a guy,

496
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:57,360
another heads up guy a couple feet back
that knew where the gunfire came from.

497
00:31:57,671 --> 00:32:00,220
And where it came from was
an Iraqi soldier friendly.

498
00:32:00,221 --> 00:32:04,570
Iraqi soldier had cracked
off rounds and accidentally,

499
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,530
accidentally. And you know, luckily
that that guy was a great guy.

500
00:32:09,531 --> 00:32:11,710
I've really heads up, guy
grabbed him, almost killed,

501
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,560
almost choke the shit
out of him right there.

502
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:19,760
But can you imagine you're clearing a
house where there's suspected and surgeons

503
00:32:19,761 --> 00:32:23,440
and all of a sudden rounds are five. Well
now you're, but this is the discipline.

504
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:27,970
And the guys knew, okay, the guys didn't
all just freak out and started shooting.

505
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:32,530
The guys were, you know,
somebody said, hey, somebody
grabbed the person that shot,

506
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,910
hey that was an AAD. Okay, wrap it
back down, wind it down, everyone calm.

507
00:32:36,911 --> 00:32:37,391
You know what I mean?

508
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:41,210
So there's the difference between guys
who have been trained really well and

509
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:43,760
when you haven't been through that
country. And again also, luckily that was,

510
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:48,020
that didn't happen on the second night
of deployment. We were, you know,

511
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,370
further into the deployment
where guys had been through it.

512
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,830
So was just like we just talked about
guys had guys had been through plenty of

513
00:32:54,831 --> 00:32:58,020
firefights at this point. So they weren't
freaked out that there was gunshots.

514
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,710
They were like, okay wait a second,
where is this gun shots coming from?

515
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:06,350
But that could have gone
really, really nasty. So train,

516
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,870
train realistically. All
right. At this point. And,

517
00:33:10,871 --> 00:33:14,630
and also just like some of the other
books we've read about World War II where

518
00:33:14,631 --> 00:33:18,020
we've got, you know, it's
basically a movement.

519
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,930
It's basically continually moving,
trying to take down targets,

520
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:24,140
trying to move forward, trying to get
through France, trying to get to Berlin.

521
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:27,860
That's, that's the situation. And it's
the same thing here. These guys, this,

522
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,600
these battalions and this regimen and the,

523
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:33,320
basically the whole task
force is trying to move from,

524
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:36,050
from city to city or town
to town through France.

525
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:41,240
And that's what's going on here. So
it's, it's a continual series of attack,

526
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,980
dig in, attack, dig in,
attack, dig in. And you know,

527
00:33:45,981 --> 00:33:48,800
you can tell from the title of the
book what they're going for is this,

528
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,400
this final, you know, some
city of St Lo and France.

529
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:57,230
So at this point there's an attack that
they were getting ready to go on and

530
00:33:57,231 --> 00:34:02,120
he's trying to figure out why it
got canceled and he's talking to,

531
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:05,990
uh, the commander and he says, I think,

532
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,230
I think you've got farther from
where you started than anyone else.

533
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,330
So he's telling these
standalone major John's,

534
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,960
your battalion went further than
anyone else back to the book. In fact,

535
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:19,850
I believe that's why division canceled
your attack. If you'd made La Forge,

536
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:25,070
you would've been way out on a limb and
stood a chance of being caught off major.

537
00:34:25,071 --> 00:34:30,071
John's elated at their comparative success
was thankful that he had not renewed

538
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:34,460
the attack and perhaps made
another 500 or a thousand yards.

539
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:38,600
They would have been out front like
clay pigeons for anyone to knock down.

540
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:43,010
There was the first time he had seen
a practical application of what was

541
00:34:43,011 --> 00:34:48,011
popularly known as the big
picture supposedly concocted
for edification of high

542
00:34:49,341 --> 00:34:51,050
brass and war correspondents,

543
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:54,950
yet sufficiently vague to cover a
certain amount of error on the ground.

544
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:01,260
So the reason that I wanted to call
that out is he's admitting that from his

545
00:35:02,841 --> 00:35:06,020
perspective, like why are you stopping
my attack? And at this point they had,

546
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,970
they'd gotten bogged down and
then they were ready to go again.

547
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:11,750
Then they got back down and now they were
ready to go and they get told to stop.

548
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,810
And so his first reaction, kind of,
what do you wait, why are we stopping?

549
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:16,310
We've actually got some
momentum right now.

550
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:21,800
And then he finds out that from the big
picture, the reason you're not attacking,

551
00:35:21,801 --> 00:35:24,290
just cause you're too far out ahead of
everyone. If you get go any further,

552
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:25,760
you might get surrounded and cut off.

553
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:31,180
Now this is a situation
where understanding why,

554
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,480
why is so helpful and especially if
you push that all the way down to the

555
00:35:37,711 --> 00:35:41,850
frontline troops and to the frontline
leadership that's out there thinking, Hey,

556
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:46,800
we finally made some some offensive
progress and we can move and we can really

557
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:51,240
take it to the enemy and now you're
telling us to stop what is going on.

558
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,850
The headquarters is stupid.
They don't get it.

559
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,950
They don't understand that
actually they do understand,

560
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:58,770
but they need to do a better
job of explaining why. So the,

561
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,640
so let the people know.

562
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,530
All right,
moving on to this next section here.

563
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:14,900
He's checking out kind of
his line now that they're,

564
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,900
now that they're dug in a little
bit, he'd gone to regiment. You know,

565
00:36:18,901 --> 00:36:21,690
it's really easy to forget that these
guys, and I talk about this a bit,

566
00:36:21,691 --> 00:36:26,280
but the best type of communications
that they have is when they actually run

567
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:30,060
wires between different, between
regiment, between battalions,

568
00:36:30,061 --> 00:36:30,930
between the companies.

569
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:36,070
They try and runs wires because the
radios are fairly temperamental on whether

570
00:36:37,051 --> 00:36:38,790
they work or not. So they
use radios, a backup,

571
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:43,791
but the primary communication
is is running a wire and
he had just gone back to

572
00:36:44,521 --> 00:36:47,640
regiment to meet face to face cause
me fake meeting face to face is very

573
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:52,641
important and you know he just comes
back up and he asks one of the company

574
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:58,260
commander, actually I think it
was his, his ops officer Newcomb.

575
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,790
He says,
Hey,

576
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:03,870
any news and new has
ops officer says Nope,

577
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,430
everything's quiet as a church.

578
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:09,120
The s three looked at the battalion
commander and the starlight and grinned as

579
00:37:09,121 --> 00:37:13,140
he went on. Now major, you don't have to
concern yourself with everything up here.

580
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,010
You just leave the details to us.
We're used to looking after them.

581
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:21,810
So a little bit of decentralized command.
Don't worry about a boss. We got this.

582
00:37:21,811 --> 00:37:25,080
We're going to be all right
now.

583
00:37:25,081 --> 00:37:27,090
Next day rolls around and here we go.

584
00:37:27,091 --> 00:37:30,870
Back to the book around 1,000 the Germans
shelled the battalion heavily but they

585
00:37:30,871 --> 00:37:31,860
didn't follow up.

586
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:37,170
Follow this up with an attack by 1100 the
wounded had all been evacuated and the

587
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,510
wire lines had been
relayed to the regimen.

588
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:45,240
The major instructed Grizzle to collect
all five company commanders and meet him

589
00:37:45,241 --> 00:37:48,630
as soon as possible at the crossroads
of the edge of the woods from which they

590
00:37:48,631 --> 00:37:49,650
had first attacked.

591
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:54,600
It was only a little way
from the regimental command
posts to the edge of the

592
00:37:54,601 --> 00:37:55,434
woods.

593
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:00,390
He got there well before the others
when they came up a few minutes later,

594
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:05,500
he knew he missed Newcomb before he caught
the meaning of their odd mode manner.

595
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:09,390
Grim sells set face have given him a hint.

596
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:14,520
As the s two step forward saluted very
stiffly and said with visible effort to

597
00:38:14,521 --> 00:38:19,350
keep his emotions under control. Sir, I
must report that captain Newcomb is dead.

598
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:24,840
The others look silently at the
ground and tears began to stream down.

599
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,850
The gentle grim sells face.

600
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:32,930
The news struck the major with the force
of a physical blow of all the fine men

601
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,990
he had met since taking
command of the battalion.

602
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:41,710
Newcomb had been one of the very best.
He was quick,

603
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,200
willing and intelligent wise,

604
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:47,080
far beyond his 24 25 years.

605
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,320
He also stared at the ground for a moment
and then ask quietly how did it happen?

606
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:58,600
Ryan spoke up, same sniper,
same place as the doc,

607
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,480
so a doc had been killed
earlier by a sniper.

608
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:05,500
One of my men wore nuke to stay
out of that gap and the hedge row,

609
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,920
but he took the steel part of his
helmet off and sat down on it.

610
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,720
Right Square in the gap itself.

611
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:14,770
The sergeant who thought the captain
must have gone nuts all of a sudden was

612
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:16,450
coming after him to drag him away,

613
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,830
but too late the sniper got
him right in the temple.

614
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:24,030
John's felt numb inside.

615
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:25,760
Okay,

616
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,720
but to dwell on his sorrow wouldn't help.
Nodding.

617
00:39:29,721 --> 00:39:32,720
Solemnly he leveled his
finger at Captain Weddell.

618
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:37,760
You are now lagoon red three but you
will retain command of your company until

619
00:39:37,761 --> 00:39:39,650
we complete the move into these woods.

620
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,580
Weddle equally grave replied.
Yes sir.

621
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:48,260
I have a little news to
Lieutenant Chadwick got half
his helmet knocked off by a

622
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:50,570
burp gun during all that
shooting a while ago.

623
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:55,370
He caught either a part of his helmet or
some of the slugs in his arm. He's out,

624
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,620
but he isn't hurt badly.
He'll be back.

625
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:02,210
Major John's who'd never met
Chadwick merely nodded again.

626
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:07,220
It didn't hurt so much when you
didn't know the man. Furthermore,

627
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,950
a wound regardless of its severity,

628
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,950
lack the awful finality of death.

629
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:17,450
Chadwick's temporary loss
meant one less officer,

630
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,420
whereas new comes death
left a hole in his heart.

631
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,660
Although he knew weddell
would probably be good.

632
00:40:24,661 --> 00:40:28,650
S three to Newcomb in the four
short days he had known him,

633
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,090
had become a friend.

634
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,830
Grim sill had moved a little away from
the others. He was leaning against a tree.

635
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,550
His head down in the curve of his arms.
Saab shaking his body.

636
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:46,890
He a newcomer to become close friends
for years and had worked together daily.

637
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,140
The major spoke to Captain Menzer,
the headquarters company commander.

638
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:58,410
See the Lieutenant Grimsey is pulled off
somewhere where it's quiet and give it

639
00:40:58,511 --> 00:41:02,680
a chance to lie down and get some rest.
If he objects, tell them it's an order.

640
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,170
I don't want to see him around anymore.
Today.

641
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,490
Yeah.

642
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:11,200
Mansour, small and Dapper.
Saluted sharply. Yes sir.

643
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,480
I'll look after George.
All right.

644
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:19,203
Okay.

645
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:24,470
These guys are taking casualties at
just an incredible amount and you know,

646
00:41:27,001 --> 00:41:31,260
you see a couple things in
here that we've heard before.

647
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,700
You know,
you see

648
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,400
the major realizing that
that gristle he's done,

649
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,930
he needs a break and you know,
he says get them off the line,

650
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,520
get him somewhere.
He can take a break.

651
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:50,380
And you also see these guys filling
billets and just getting promoted.

652
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,030
You know,
battlefield promoted,

653
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:57,410
the guy was all one of the company
commanders Weddle he becomes the,

654
00:41:57,411 --> 00:42:01,100
he becomes the operations
officer. Boom on the spot. It's,

655
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:07,100
it's
really,

656
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:11,540
you can see why this book was
when a hack words favorite books.

657
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:12,643
Hmm.

658
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:18,910
So now they're, they're holed up for a
while and here we go back to the book,

659
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:20,170
10 days,
drag by wall.

660
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,910
The battalion sat in Boyda breadwinner
if the days where sometimes doll,

661
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,320
they were rarely uneventful.

662
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:31,450
Men were wounded or killed nearly every
day by artillery mortars or the fire

663
00:42:31,451 --> 00:42:32,410
from self prepaid.

664
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,910
It propelled 88 that could move unseen
into positions from which they could fire

665
00:42:36,911 --> 00:42:41,911
into the tops of trees of the Blah and
then pull back before the artillery men

666
00:42:42,161 --> 00:42:46,650
could bring fire on them.
Those casualties were bad enough,

667
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,600
but they were to be expected.

668
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,340
There was one incident that the battalion
commander thought they could have got

669
00:42:53,341 --> 00:42:58,341
along very nicely without regimen and
directed that the battalions erect Barb

670
00:42:58,381 --> 00:43:01,710
wire along their whole front,
which they did cheerfully,

671
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,580
but when a truck load of anti
personnel mines came down,

672
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,950
the major looked at them with misgivings.

673
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:13,300
Those things were as dangerous to the
people who laid them as those as they work

674
00:43:13,301 --> 00:43:17,790
to the enemy. He thought so. He
supervised the mind lane carefully,

675
00:43:17,791 --> 00:43:21,630
meticulously noting the location of
each mine on a large scale sketch of the

676
00:43:21,631 --> 00:43:26,430
area being mined.
The day after all the mines were laid,

677
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:31,620
he heard the flat multiple muffled
roar of a landmine at once.

678
00:43:31,621 --> 00:43:33,330
He ran toward the sound.

679
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:37,800
He got there with the aid men to
watch with sorrow and anger while they

680
00:43:37,801 --> 00:43:41,610
evacuated. Three men from the
middle of their own mind field.

681
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:43,620
One of them was dead.

682
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:49,590
The last litter carried our period
who badly hit in the legs with several

683
00:43:49,591 --> 00:43:52,500
fragments,
did not know how severely he was hurt.

684
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:58,920
The other wounded men unconscious was
being placed on the medical jeep when

685
00:43:58,921 --> 00:44:02,550
still another literal came around the
corner of the little farm house that stood

686
00:44:02,551 --> 00:44:06,960
on the edge of the woods. The man
on this litter had his eyes closed,

687
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,100
his face twisting horribly.
He jerked over.

688
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,010
He jerked all over bringing
his legs up so hard.

689
00:44:14,011 --> 00:44:16,020
The aid men had to hold
them down on the litter.

690
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:21,720
The major looking at the man and wonder,
asked, what's the matter with him?

691
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:27,580
The eight men were
contemptuous. Ah, said one.

692
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,650
This guy never got hit by nothing.

693
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:32,340
He was in a whole 50 yards
from where it happened,

694
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,580
but he started screaming and yelling
and carrying on something awful.

695
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:40,200
We thought he was hit, but he ain't
got a hole in him. He was like this.

696
00:44:40,201 --> 00:44:41,034
When we got to him,

697
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:47,510
John's realized he had just seen his
first case of neuro psychosis commonly

698
00:44:48,691 --> 00:44:51,840
called combat exhaustion or c II.

699
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,620
It wasn't the only one he was to see.

700
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:02,090
So you got,

701
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:07,820
well I guess that's is that friendly fire
friendly fire when you hit one of your

702
00:45:07,821 --> 00:45:11,690
own landmines
night

703
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:12,603
mirror

704
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:19,270
now.
And also that you start seeing some,

705
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:22,640
some psychological damage to guys on the,
on the front line.

706
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,960
And you know, that guy's not going
to be any good. He can't fight.

707
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:31,460
He's literally screaming and jerking
around. They have to hold him down.

708
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:37,491
All right,

709
00:45:37,491 --> 00:45:42,491
now the battalion is going to move
in and take over a whole area,

710
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:48,110
um, from the third armored division
and it's in moving into this area.

711
00:45:48,111 --> 00:45:51,830
It's got 300 replacements coming
in. So, so think about that.

712
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:56,210
Battalion supposed to be 900 people
and they're getting 300 replacements.

713
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,950
So that tells you, and again,
I am breezing, I'm skipping,
I'm not even breathing,

714
00:46:00,951 --> 00:46:01,731
I'm not breezing through.

715
00:46:01,731 --> 00:46:05,750
I'm skipping so much of the
fighting and combat in this book,

716
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:11,000
but it's just going on continuously.
And at this point they're going in,

717
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:15,740
they have, they already have
300 replacements. So they've,
they've had 300 people,

718
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:20,390
uh, you know, taken out or, or
either either wounded or killed.

719
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,120
So at this point,

720
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:29,230
Lieutenant Ryan's company is on a
patrol and they're going to go set up an

721
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:33,140
outpost into some pretty,

722
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:38,600
pretty rough area.
And as the patrols out there,

723
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:41,870
here we go.
Then came the first shots from the patrol.

724
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,040
They were going in well and it looked
for a few seconds as if Ryan was going to

725
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:47,180
get to his outpost.

726
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:52,520
But a flare of three red star clusters
floated up from the German lines and all

727
00:46:52,521 --> 00:46:54,020
hell broke loose again.

728
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:59,780
Every kraut gun that had been used
to help stop the third armored plus,

729
00:46:59,781 --> 00:47:04,580
probably a few that had come in late,
opened up on about 150 yards of a,

730
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:06,170
of the able company front.

731
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:10,130
It was concentrated thunderous murder,

732
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:13,430
such as no one in the
battalion had ever seen before.

733
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:19,660
Ryan's line was a massive saving leaping
flame that looked as if it were fed

734
00:47:20,211 --> 00:47:25,211
from below rather than from
an inconceivable torrent
of shells that came on and

735
00:47:26,481 --> 00:47:27,890
on and on.

736
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:35,180
The barrage switch suddenly from the
company to the Battalion Command Post area

737
00:47:35,181 --> 00:47:35,780
itself,

738
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:39,830
the battalion commander and his staff
hearing the first wine to the shells dived

739
00:47:39,831 --> 00:47:44,210
for the new command post hole where they
huddled walk while the walls shuttered

740
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:46,250
and dirt rain down from the roof.

741
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:50,900
Concussion blew out the candles,
but nobody was hurt.

742
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:56,570
The German gunners switch to c
company for a few rounds then right,

743
00:47:56,571 --> 00:48:00,020
went right back to their
prime target able company.

744
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:01,110
Yeah.

745
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:03,120
While they were pounding Kenny's company,

746
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:08,330
a single short call came in over
the 300 which is their radio able.

747
00:48:08,431 --> 00:48:11,910
Six is clipped.
That meant Ryan had been hit,

748
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:13,560
but there were no details.

749
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,050
20 minutes after that pretty red star
cluster went up. All was quiet again,

750
00:48:19,051 --> 00:48:23,520
except for some moans and cries for medics
that floated back from able company,

751
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:27,300
but at least know Germany.
Infantry had come in under fire

752
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:31,110
in the 20 in that 20 minutes,

753
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:35,160
the company lost 54 men
plus it's company commander.

754
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,660
Almost every man in the patrol had been
caught above ground and was killed or

755
00:48:39,661 --> 00:48:43,890
wounded while most of the other casualties
came from tree and hedge row bursts

756
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,320
that sent fragments down into the holes.

757
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:52,560
The men of the command post group gathered
around the whole silently watch the

758
00:48:52,561 --> 00:48:57,000
parade of walking wounded that filed
slowly by on the way to the aid station.

759
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,260
Occasionally a man
would stumble or waiver,

760
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:04,590
whereupon a messenger or wire
man would jump to help him.

761
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:09,930
Every aid man and litter in the battalion
was already up at the abl line and the

762
00:49:09,931 --> 00:49:12,840
first litters were not far
behind the walking wounded.

763
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:19,100
Some of the victims moaned and a
few cried out a little now and then,

764
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,960
but most were very quiet.

765
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:26,860
John's was glad he could not
see their faces in the dark.

766
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:33,720
The last litter went by with no word
from Ryan Johnson's beginning to hope he

767
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:37,830
hadn't been hurt badly.
When four men loomed out of the darkness,

768
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:42,150
each carrying a corner of a blanket.
Ryan was half sitting,

769
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:44,190
half lying in the makeshift litter,

770
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:48,240
gritting his teeth at the pain of
the wounds in an arm and a leg.

771
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:53,680
They laid the blanket down gently in
front of the major who stripped off his

772
00:49:53,681 --> 00:49:55,900
coat and laid it over.
The company. Commander

773
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,870
Ryan managed to work up a feeble grin.

774
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,000
Okay?

775
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,520
It didn't work too good,
did it boss?

776
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:16,993
That's

777
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:22,730
know when you're the company,

778
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:25,460
when you're the battalion commander and
you come up with a plan with the company

779
00:50:25,461 --> 00:50:28,430
commander and you think
you've everything right and

780
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,040
you lose 54 guys in a
company in 20 minutes

781
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:40,700
and your company commander comes
back and says, it didn't go too good,

782
00:50:40,701 --> 00:50:43,010
did it boss to heavy weight.

783
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:52,830
Now they do end up pushing forward.
They get some ground and

784
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:54,940
okay,

785
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:58,330
he's out checking and you're gonna,
you're gonna find this out.

786
00:50:58,331 --> 00:50:59,380
And he talks about it,

787
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,520
but he goes forward to find out what's
going on and make sure the guys see him.

788
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:06,190
And at one point he's checking an outpost,

789
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:11,320
a little outpost where they're guarding
this certain area and all the guys in

790
00:51:11,321 --> 00:51:16,321
the group are focused on a tank on old
burned out tank that's out there in front

791
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:20,980
of him and he comes up to them
and here we go. Back to the book.

792
00:51:20,981 --> 00:51:22,480
John's pointed to the corner.

793
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:26,110
Does it take all three of you to watch
that tank while the whole German army

794
00:51:26,111 --> 00:51:28,660
could crawl up to within 10
feet of you without knowing it?

795
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,180
The sergeants mouth dropped open.
God Major.

796
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:38,070
I never even thought about it after
they shot at us from the tank last time.

797
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:39,331
Well,

798
00:51:39,331 --> 00:51:44,180
you better damn straight start
thinking about your flanks if you want.

799
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:47,640
If you want to end up
being able to think at all.

800
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:52,870
I wouldn't give a damn if they knocked
all three. You stupid bastards out.

801
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:55,210
But if they got you,

802
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:58,570
they'd have a good chance of getting
into the middle of your company and I

803
00:51:58,571 --> 00:52:03,130
wouldn't like that. Now.
Damn you start thinking

804
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:08,810
again. You know what? He's detached.

805
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:12,230
Those guys just got shot
at from those 10 that tank.

806
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:14,750
They're not worried about their flank.
They're worried about that tank.

807
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:17,300
Another sniper being in there, another
machine gunner sneaking up into it,

808
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,690
so he's detached. He
rolls up and sees, Hey,

809
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,800
I see that you're focused on the tank, but
you can't. You've got to keep thinking.

810
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:28,953
Yeah.

811
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:32,190
Going back to the book, orders came
down during the night directing lagoon.

812
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:36,360
Red Major John's first battalion of the
hundred and 15th Infantry Regiment would

813
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:39,990
relieve lemon read by
midnight of the following day,

814
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:45,090
lemon was code named for the hundred
and 16th who's read first battalion was

815
00:52:45,091 --> 00:52:48,160
holding the line to the
left of where lagoon read.

816
00:52:48,161 --> 00:52:50,640
It hopped off nearly three weeks before,

817
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:56,380
so they're growing up to relieve and and
hold the line they're going up to do,

818
00:52:56,470 --> 00:53:00,940
to take positions and hold them.
Meeting the commander of this,

819
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:04,900
of this group that they're taking
the place of back to the book,

820
00:53:04,901 --> 00:53:08,710
the big commander introducing himself,
shook hands all around, they need,

821
00:53:08,711 --> 00:53:13,600
took a deep breath and started in on
a careful detailed briefing fellows.

822
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:15,490
He said,
this is a hot spot.

823
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:18,700
I know you've all been in
hot lots of them before,

824
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:22,420
but please take my word for it.
This one is really hot.

825
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:27,330
He paused and looked at the as if to make
sure they were going to take his word

826
00:53:27,331 --> 00:53:28,560
for it.
Then he went on.

827
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,770
We've got Nazi paratroopers on
the other side of the hedge rows.

828
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:37,470
They're the best that Hitler has and they
know it. They don't give us much rest.

829
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,420
We don't give them any.

830
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:43,680
Okay,

831
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,780
we have casualties every day,

832
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:50,310
so please do your best not to cause
any more than we have to take. Anyway.

833
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:56,220
My boys had been here for two weeks
now and they're getting right touchy.

834
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:00,180
So if any of you get snapped that
don't take, don't pay attention to it,

835
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:03,420
just go on and they'll get over it.

836
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:07,350
So this guys guys are pretty
burnt out at this point

837
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:14,300
and they do this,
they do this turnover

838
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:20,210
and he goes out and, and again, the
turnover happens, there's more combat,

839
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:25,130
there's more casualties. And
then he's going out, but they'd,

840
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,190
things settled down and he's going
out to check the line. And here we go.

841
00:54:28,191 --> 00:54:29,540
Back to the book as Usual Major.

842
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:32,000
John's asked a number of men
how they were getting along.

843
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,230
He got one answer that surprised him and
sergeant said, Welser, everything's okay.

844
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:37,191
It's a tough spot.

845
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:40,490
But I figured where as good as any other
outfit to hold it down and somebody's

846
00:54:40,491 --> 00:54:44,720
got to do it. But I sure wish the major
would get around and see us more often.

847
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:48,350
Does the men a world of good to
see you down here in the lines?

848
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,690
The major who had fought,

849
00:54:50,691 --> 00:54:53,990
he was getting around about as often
as any battalion commander should were

850
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:56,930
seriously concerned because this
sergeant didn't seem to think so.

851
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,540
Instead of being annoyed,

852
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:04,910
he was pleased that the man
had the uncommon guts to
say what he thought whether

853
00:55:04,911 --> 00:55:07,010
or not he was right.
So there you go.

854
00:55:07,011 --> 00:55:10,790
Battalion commander instead of getting
all mad that this sergeant says something,

855
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,740
he's actually thankful he answered.
Okay Sarge,

856
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,550
you'll see me around a lot more in the
future. The sergeant saluted sharply,

857
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:20,660
whereupon stone.

858
00:55:20,661 --> 00:55:24,530
This is new company commander stone
and the major went on stone trying to

859
00:55:24,531 --> 00:55:28,730
stammer out and apology for the
Brash Sergeant Johns. Cut Him off,

860
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:32,210
but not before stone had volunteered the
statement that he himself thought the

861
00:55:32,211 --> 00:55:35,330
major got around more than any other
battalion commander. He never seen

862
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,340
the fact that stone had not seen petty
battalion commanders did not escape Johns

863
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:44,850
who smiled to himself as the company
commander lapsed into an embarrassed

864
00:55:44,851 --> 00:55:49,790
silence.
On the way back to battalion.

865
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,670
You reviewed his own approach
to the problem of leadership.

866
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,430
He knew that he must prove himself,

867
00:55:55,550 --> 00:56:00,200
especially his courage to every man in
the outfit if he expected to get the

868
00:56:00,201 --> 00:56:01,670
maximum from them.

869
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:08,050
He felt that he had done so fairly
effectively as far as seed company was

870
00:56:08,181 --> 00:56:12,230
concerned because he stayed with them
that night for the counter attack,

871
00:56:12,231 --> 00:56:15,350
the that had threatened their left flank.
Also,

872
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:20,150
his personal intelligence service told
him that a company had approved the

873
00:56:20,151 --> 00:56:23,920
little battle he and grim Sul and Martin
had had with a machine that it killed

874
00:56:23,921 --> 00:56:26,650
Jimmy and Sadler.
So he's got his own.

875
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:30,600
You like notice that his
personal intelligence service,
that means he's got, I,

876
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:31,690
I've talked about this before,

877
00:56:31,691 --> 00:56:34,150
where you got your own guys that
are telling you what's going on.

878
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:37,810
So his own little guys had
told them that a company,

879
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:42,670
they respected him and they knew he was
going to get after it back to the book,

880
00:56:42,671 --> 00:56:45,910
but it was apparent that this was going
to be a company by company proposition.

881
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:50,410
Baker company didn't seem to be impressed.
He'd have to do something about that.

882
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:57,343
Now

883
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:00,880
this is just another thing
about leadership there.

884
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:03,940
He's on a field phone and again I talked
about how they put these wires in and

885
00:57:03,941 --> 00:57:08,770
he's on a field phone and he gets done
making something happen on the field

886
00:57:08,771 --> 00:57:10,990
phone to puts down the phone on the table.

887
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:13,690
The phone rang before
anyone could say anything.

888
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:17,050
John's picked it up barking red six.
That's his call side.

889
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:22,270
The operators voice came through
clearly. Are you finished? Yes, I am.

890
00:57:22,271 --> 00:57:25,060
He slammed it back on the table
where it all shook his head.

891
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,140
You forgot to ring off.

892
00:57:26,141 --> 00:57:29,500
Major Sergeant Wilson gives the operators
hell if they don't make sure the lines

893
00:57:29,501 --> 00:57:32,890
are clear. Sergeant Wilson was
the acting communications officer.

894
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:36,010
The original man had been killed
and Wilson was doing a fine job.

895
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:38,560
He'd been in for a
commission for quite a while.

896
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:42,010
John's picked up the phone and
twisted the crank on the leather case.

897
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:46,210
The operator answered instantly.
Yes sir. What's your name?

898
00:57:46,211 --> 00:57:50,830
Operator private Henderson, sir.
The voice was a little uncertain.

899
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:54,790
Okay. Private Henderson, you keep doing
your job the way you're supposed to.

900
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:59,560
Don't mind me if I snap at you once
in a while. I'm sorry. He finished.

901
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:05,020
He started to lay the phone down,
smiled, picked it up and added, finished.

902
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,780
So again, you can see he's a
guy that doesn't get all crazy.

903
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:14,200
When, when you know, when
people come to him and say, Hey,

904
00:58:14,201 --> 00:58:16,960
you're supposed to sign off the line.
I got to keep these lines open.

905
00:58:16,961 --> 00:58:18,370
You're not signing off the line.
Are you done?

906
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:25,150
You see EGOMANIAC leaders do that.
Get crazy on stupid stuff.

907
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,550
They're not following their own rules.

908
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,490
Now talking about this network,
uh,

909
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:35,730
talking about these communications
here we go back to look this,

910
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:39,310
this network of communications enabled
three men to keep accurate minute by

911
00:58:39,311 --> 00:58:42,430
minute track of all that was
going over on the entire front,

912
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:46,270
covered by nearly 600
men from this one spot.

913
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:50,290
They could direct the lives of all those
men actors in the most thrilling and

914
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:53,380
awful drama of all time.
So the way that they're doing this,

915
00:58:53,381 --> 00:58:57,250
and I should have explained this earlier,
is you have the,

916
00:58:57,370 --> 00:59:02,140
the battalion commander and he has a
small staff of people that stay with him.

917
00:59:02,141 --> 00:59:06,070
Most of the time his operations
officer has communications officer,

918
00:59:06,071 --> 00:59:09,910
his intelligence officer. And what they
do is when they get to certain positions,

919
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:14,530
they find a command post, a CP.
And when they're in the field,

920
00:59:14,531 --> 00:59:19,531
what they do is they dig a big giant
foxhole and they make it as good as they

921
00:59:19,871 --> 00:59:22,280
can that they put logs over the top of it.

922
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:25,480
They put dirt on top of that or sand bags
or something. So they're pretty, they,

923
00:59:25,481 --> 00:59:29,420
they're trying to get pretty secure in
there from overhead artillery attacks.

924
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:35,320
And then they run wires out to set
up communications with all these,

925
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:40,630
all the company commanders who have their
own little command posts and obviously

926
00:59:40,851 --> 00:59:44,030
this thing isn't permanent because it
has to be mobile because tomorrow night,

927
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,620
the next night we might move another
thousand yards or 500 yards and then that

928
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:51,950
that foxhole that we'd row Doug
isn't doing us any good anymore,

929
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:56,270
but from this little command
post that they set up there,

930
00:59:56,271 --> 00:59:57,560
they're running this whole show.

931
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:01,310
Now he talks about his decision
making here back to the book.

932
01:00:01,311 --> 01:00:03,740
If he made a wrong decision,
he could cause men to lose,

933
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,610
lose their lives needlessly
or if he was clever or lucky,

934
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:11,930
he might by moving a single squad or
platoon or calling for fire support,

935
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:17,120
defeat the enemy and gain additional
glory for the unit all without moving from

936
01:00:17,121 --> 01:00:21,320
his communications.
When in a defensive position such as this.

937
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:27,260
Then he's talking to her about like some
of that drama that happens back to the

938
01:00:27,261 --> 01:00:27,530
book.

939
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:31,940
A single rifle shot could mean the death
of a company commander or it could mean

940
01:00:31,941 --> 01:00:32,774
nothing.

941
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:37,970
A mortar round might wipe out an outpost
and lay a company open to a surprise

942
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:42,130
attack, or it might only kick
up a little dust and scar.

943
01:00:42,131 --> 01:00:43,070
A few trees,

944
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:48,950
volley of artillery fire could come
through the roof over their heads or it

945
01:00:48,951 --> 01:00:52,190
could burst harmlessly
in the fields outside.

946
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:58,390
A burst of fire from the orchard could
mean another pig because they had killed

947
01:00:58,581 --> 01:01:03,020
some pigs that they thought were
enemy or a full scale German attack.

948
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:08,900
Each sound built up a certain amount of
suspense to greater or lesser degree.

949
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:12,440
The ring of the phone itself built the
tension higher and higher until the first

950
01:01:12,441 --> 01:01:17,441
words that came in would perhaps screw
it even tighter or dispel it entirely.

951
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:24,430
So that's the life that they're living
and just high pressure all the time.

952
01:01:26,961 --> 01:01:27,651
But you know,

953
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:30,830
you hear a massive explosion and this is
the same thing I think Lafe was talking

954
01:01:30,831 --> 01:01:33,560
about on the podcast. You
know, you'd hear an explosion,

955
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,960
you have no idea what it is.
You don't know if it's friendly,

956
01:01:35,961 --> 01:01:38,420
you don't know if it's a
tank round being fired.

957
01:01:38,421 --> 01:01:39,710
You don't know if it's an IED going off.

958
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,770
You don't know if it's a a mortar
round impact, you can't, it maybe,

959
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:46,010
maybe these guys got to a point
where they can tell the difference.

960
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,560
But I'll tell you what,
you get in an urban combat and there's,

961
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,990
the sound is refracting
off all the buildings.

962
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:54,710
It's hard to tell where it came from and
it's definitely hard to tell what it is.

963
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:55,723
And by the way,

964
01:01:56,930 --> 01:02:01,930
the artillery rounds that hit
our water's being used as ids.

965
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:07,280
So you don't know what it is.
It's really hard to tell.

966
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:12,710
But it was weird too in, in, in
Ramadi, there was constantly on fire.

967
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:16,320
Like you, when you went
outside, you just hear bonded.

968
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:22,200
He was always out there, you
know, even if it was even,

969
01:02:22,201 --> 01:02:24,030
it was on the other side of
the city. I mean you, you can,

970
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:25,531
maybe not the other side of the city,

971
01:02:25,531 --> 01:02:28,860
but if it was in downtown Ramadi and
we were back at our base, you know,

972
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:31,530
we'd go up on the rooftop of my building
and sit there and you could just

973
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:35,550
tracers all night, you know, the
marines down in the government center,

974
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:40,530
we're getting attacked for the 14th
night in a row, you know, the outpost,

975
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:44,490
the, the army soldiers or camp
Corregidor was getting mortared. I mean,

976
01:02:44,491 --> 01:02:48,720
it was just constant Lee happening.
So what was it where you,

977
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:53,650
if it's closer, that's when it's the
concern or context in general or, no,

978
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:57,840
just the, yeah, this, the
overall context for us.

979
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,540
For me it was like,
okay, you know, you just,

980
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:03,810
you just knew that there was constant
fighting going on or something was going

981
01:03:03,811 --> 01:03:06,870
on. And yeah, I mean obviously
if it was closer than the,

982
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:11,310
the louder it is and the closer it is,
the more of a concern it because certain,

983
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:19,910
yeah, he talks about, again, this is a
subject we hear about all the time. Uh,

984
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:23,940
the German mortars and gunners must've
registered too because they had the exact

985
01:03:23,941 --> 01:03:28,200
range of every foot of hedgerow held
by the battalion on the 10th of July.

986
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:30,870
They covered almost every
foot of the hedge row.

987
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:36,060
That's sort of gunnery was rough on the
men they never knew in the first round

988
01:03:36,061 --> 01:03:39,690
would fall, but once it had
splattered with its flat crash,

989
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:44,760
they all knew that six or maybe a dozen
more were coming each one a little

990
01:03:44,761 --> 01:03:49,350
further up or down the hedge row.
When you heard that first one,

991
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:54,600
you pulled the bottom of your fox hole
right up to your belly and prayed.

992
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:59,430
When you heard the second one, you knew
whether or not they were coming your way.

993
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:03,420
If they were coming towards you,
it got right rough.

994
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:08,580
Each round was a little closer and they
were so damned deliberate about it that

995
01:04:08,581 --> 01:04:11,880
the waiting was worth worst than
the crash of the shell itself.

996
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:16,440
You laid there and counted the seconds
between the shells until you knew that

997
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:18,570
the next one was yours.

998
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:24,680
The 20 seconds or so was the longest one
in the world because you never knew if

999
01:04:25,021 --> 01:04:29,310
you were safe until the shell hit.
It could hit anywhere outside your whole,

1000
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:30,840
even a matter of inches,

1001
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:35,760
and you're okay if it
hit in the hole with you,

1002
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:37,530
you'd never know it.
Of course,

1003
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:43,050
actually only a few shells ever
made direct hits on Fox holes,

1004
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:47,640
but some did and nearly every man had
seen a fox hole that had been hit.

1005
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:53,630
There was always the little tail fin
section left on the surface and after the

1006
01:04:54,061 --> 01:04:55,830
litter bearers had come and gone,

1007
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,180
there was only a pool of dark muck to
show that somebody had been in the hole.

1008
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:04,980
It happened twice that day.
So

1009
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:10,830
this one you can, I don't know if
you quite followed what's happening.

1010
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:14,490
These guys are in a hedge row. So when
they're in a linear position, right,

1011
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:19,940
and the way you work mortars is you make
small adjustments on them and and the

1012
01:05:20,861 --> 01:05:24,930
way that you fire it targets when you
don't know what the distance is you,

1013
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:27,640
you put the first one is
going to be long and then you,

1014
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:32,680
you adjust a lot shorter. So then you
come back and it's called bracketing.

1015
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:36,700
So you know you might come back
five clicks and then that was,

1016
01:05:36,701 --> 01:05:38,830
now you're now you hit in front
of the target, now you go back,

1017
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,470
now you go forward again, four clicks,
it hits a little behind the target.

1018
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:44,290
Now you come back three, two, one
and then boom, you hit your target.

1019
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:46,330
So on the mortar thing,

1020
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:51,760
there's like the actual tool that kind
of yeah, you're adjusting the elevation.

1021
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,910
Yes. Up and down, a little dial.

1022
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:59,440
It's going up and down to to fire.

1023
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:01,180
At what angle? You want
to find that? Yeah.

1024
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:05,380
So what you do is when you shoot a mortar,
you, you're the first one, you go long,

1025
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,570
the second one you estimate short,

1026
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,730
and then you basically can split
the difference between those two.

1027
01:06:09,731 --> 01:06:12,080
I'm going to be pretty close
and like you work with uh,

1028
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:17,230
a legit mortar team and the third
round is going to be spot on.

1029
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,260
But what he's saying here is the Germans,

1030
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:24,970
they already knew the exact
settings for where to put,

1031
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:27,790
oh, we see movement at this part of
the head road. They don't need to take,

1032
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:31,480
they just go to their
predesignated settings. They
can put a round right on that.

1033
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:34,270
So they kind of figured it out beforehand
and figured out beforehand they know

1034
01:06:34,271 --> 01:06:37,130
the exact cause of what you, what'd you
have to, you know the distance? Yeah.

1035
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:40,210
You know the distance that the
mortar shoots at a certain elevation.

1036
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:43,990
But what they don't know is if you're
trying to shoot at something that you

1037
01:06:43,991 --> 01:06:46,810
don't know exactly where it is, well
then you have to estimate the distance,

1038
01:06:46,811 --> 01:06:50,350
which is a little bit challenging to
do. Now. A good sniper or a good mortar,

1039
01:06:50,351 --> 01:06:54,220
men are going to be pretty
close. You know, snipers know
that, hey, this thing Vic,

1040
01:06:54,221 --> 01:06:55,420
get it down to really,

1041
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,510
you know how many meters it is and
same thing with a good mortar man,

1042
01:06:58,870 --> 01:06:59,710
but even that,

1043
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:03,790
you know when you're talking about
a far distance of 800,000 meters,

1044
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:06,790
you might be off by 50 meters and that's,
you know,

1045
01:07:06,791 --> 01:07:09,280
being off by 50 meters with
a mortar is a big distance.

1046
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:11,200
Not going to kill the target
that you're trying to hit.

1047
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,350
But with these Germans at this point,

1048
01:07:14,351 --> 01:07:16,370
they already have everything
measured and dial.

1049
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:17,990
They have a range card is what we call it.

1050
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:21,280
Arrange card means like I know exactly
I'm, when you set up in a position,

1051
01:07:21,281 --> 01:07:23,920
you could have your range finder and you
find out what the range and distance of

1052
01:07:23,921 --> 01:07:26,230
everything they were looking at.
So you know exactly how far it is.

1053
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,460
You can dial in your scope. Boom, oh,

1054
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:30,880
I see somebody over at that corner of
that building that's 832 meters. Boom,

1055
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:35,210
crack. Remember the game battleship.
Remember that? I do remember that.

1056
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:37,670
They'll have a ship. Yeah. It's
like you can't see it, but you,

1057
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:41,050
and you're trying to figure it out a
little bit. It is your, you're basically,

1058
01:07:41,051 --> 01:07:43,270
your first round is going to be a
little bit, if you hit something,

1059
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:48,220
then you got to adjust those.
Yeah. So what the Germans,

1060
01:07:48,221 --> 01:07:48,641
like I said,

1061
01:07:48,641 --> 01:07:53,641
the Germans had these things preregistered
and then what they would do is they

1062
01:07:53,741 --> 01:07:56,720
would just drop,
they would just hit the whole hedge row.

1063
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,270
They go right down the life.

1064
01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:02,320
And these guys knew that
once the first round goes,

1065
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:06,640
it's either going to be moving away from
me on the hydro or toward me. Oh yeah.

1066
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:10,870
Yeah. And so can you imagine the, the
damn pressure when you're sitting there,

1067
01:08:10,871 --> 01:08:13,180
that first round goes,
and now the next round,

1068
01:08:13,181 --> 01:08:15,470
where's it gonna be further away from me?
Meaning the Germans are going to die,

1069
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:18,930
are dialing away from me, right? Or
are they dialing towards me? Yeah.

1070
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:22,190
And then how many rounds are they going
to go? Because if they do enough rounds,

1071
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:27,340
you're, you're going to be all right.
You're, you're not there. The game.

1072
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:30,860
That's exactly what the Hala and what's
interesting is those, like he said,

1073
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:35,000
if the, if the mortar hits outside
of your foxhole by an inch,

1074
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:39,770
you're probably going to be okay because
the mortar blast goes up and out when

1075
01:08:39,771 --> 01:08:43,730
it hits the ground. If it hits
in your foxhole, your dead,

1076
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:48,590
and so there's this, this kind of
randomness that you're dealing with.

1077
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:52,163
All right.

1078
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:58,630
Going back to the book a little after
the after 1700 general Gearhart came

1079
01:08:58,851 --> 01:09:01,670
striding through the trees
behind the company post hole.

1080
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:07,340
He came on serious business that
of giving orders for an attack.

1081
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:12,080
If he carried them by himself,
they were important gentlemen.

1082
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:15,290
He said with the edge to his
voice that was impressive.

1083
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:19,250
The division attacks tomorrow
at zero 600 all along the line.

1084
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,160
This is the drive for St Lo.

1085
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:27,620
There were a few details of Italians
would attack as the general ad set at zero

1086
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:32,621
600 the first battalion would advance
into southwesterly direction with the

1087
01:09:33,141 --> 01:09:36,140
village of Bel Fontaine
as its initial objective.

1088
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:40,550
That was about all of them
was to it except for the
usual information concerning

1089
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:42,380
artillery support supplies,

1090
01:09:42,381 --> 01:09:46,040
location of regimental command post
and that sort of thing. So pretty

1091
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:49,970
pretty broad orders like, hey,
this is what we're going to do.

1092
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:53,750
We're an attack tomorrow,
zero 600 the mission is to get St Lo

1093
01:09:53,970 --> 01:09:54,803
hmm

1094
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,331
back to the book.

1095
01:09:58,331 --> 01:10:01,030
By the time the order got down to
the platoon leaders in their part,

1096
01:10:01,090 --> 01:10:05,470
their part was pretty simple. All Day
in turn had to say was, all right gang,

1097
01:10:05,471 --> 01:10:08,980
let's take the next hedge row.
When the company commanders had gone,

1098
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,960
the staff discussed the plan of attack.

1099
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:15,790
The question bothering John's most of
all was where to put the advanced command

1100
01:10:15,791 --> 01:10:20,170
post group. He wanted to hold
casualties to the barest minimum,

1101
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,510
yet he wanted to be as
far forward as possible.

1102
01:10:22,511 --> 01:10:26,410
So he's talking about where should he
actually positioned himself and his small

1103
01:10:26,411 --> 01:10:30,610
team of battalion staff.
Where should they position themselves?

1104
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:32,800
It's funny too because when we
talk about battalion staffing,

1105
01:10:32,801 --> 01:10:34,640
are you talking about,
I don't know,

1106
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,620
a battalion staff can be pretty
big when you're in a big battalion,

1107
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,270
but this is not a big group.

1108
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:45,480
This small group especially
because they've taken so
many casualties back to the

1109
01:10:45,701 --> 01:10:48,610
book. There were a number of good
reasons for this in the first place.

1110
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:51,970
Keeping the command group close to the
companies made a lot of difference in

1111
01:10:51,971 --> 01:10:54,850
communications,
particularly in this close wooded country.

1112
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:59,470
A clump of heavy trees are a high hydro
could spell the margin between having

1113
01:10:59,471 --> 01:11:03,670
contact and not having it.
That was of supreme importance.

1114
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:06,250
Second,
if you had,

1115
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:09,520
and this is why I was talking
about keeping the plan
simple cause when you start

1116
01:11:09,521 --> 01:11:13,090
getting split up from people and you
can't maintain communications with them,

1117
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:18,590
the difference between not
having communication and
having communications is is

1118
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:23,370
night and day. It's disaster and
success. It's victory and defeat.

1119
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:27,450
[inaudible] back to the book.
Second, if he had to move a Bhag,

1120
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:32,070
if he had to move to a bog down
company or to any trouble spot,

1121
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:34,380
he wanted to have the shortest
possible distance to go.

1122
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,090
So he wants to be close enough
to have good communication.

1123
01:11:37,091 --> 01:11:39,150
So he also wants to be close enough
that if something's going wrong,

1124
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:42,600
he can get there and make things happen.
Third,

1125
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:46,140
the group couldn't afford to stay far
behind in any event because they fully

1126
01:11:46,141 --> 01:11:48,660
expected the German paratroopers
to close in around them.

1127
01:11:48,661 --> 01:11:52,830
As soon as they started to advance.
If the command post group,

1128
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:54,450
we're too far from the rifle companies,

1129
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:57,540
it would have a good chance of getting
caught off and destroyed or captured.

1130
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:02,010
Then there was always the consideration
that the men like to know that the old

1131
01:12:02,011 --> 01:12:07,011
man was not far behind and to see him
once in a while when the stuff was flying

1132
01:12:07,201 --> 01:12:10,620
around.
So these are things he's considering.

1133
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:15,930
They're getting ready, you know, it's
now getting closer to the attack.

1134
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:18,690
Back to the book, the staff was
uneasy. They didn't want to turn in.

1135
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:22,170
They couldn't say why there had
been other nights like this.

1136
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:26,820
They all sensed that everyone
shared their own nameless fears.

1137
01:12:30,610 --> 01:12:32,470
Now they start their movement.

1138
01:12:33,190 --> 01:12:38,190
Suddenly a terrific firing broke out
every German cannon mortar rifle and

1139
01:12:38,501 --> 01:12:42,400
machine gun that fired around
that day cut loose simultaneously.

1140
01:12:42,610 --> 01:12:44,980
The sound of mortars
coughing on the German side,

1141
01:12:44,981 --> 01:12:47,200
blended with the scream
of incoming shells,

1142
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:51,670
grim Salon Hoffman slid down the steps
the whole before the first round is hit,

1143
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,790
the phone rang major,
John's grabbed it.

1144
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:59,850
Red Six Charlie six or we're catching
hell down here with mortars and artillery.

1145
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:04,600
I think the, I think there's enemy
infantry coming in under the fire.

1146
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:07,930
So the idea is cover and move you.

1147
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:11,980
You do this as an infantry
platoon or company or a battalion.

1148
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:13,900
You put suppressive fire.

1149
01:13:13,901 --> 01:13:18,250
So you start launching mortars at your
enemy and then while they're all taking

1150
01:13:18,251 --> 01:13:22,450
cover you advance. And so that's
what he's talking about. He says,

1151
01:13:22,451 --> 01:13:27,451
I think there's enemy infantry coming
in under the fire stone broke in

1152
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:33,250
the operator having wisely since the
crisis and cut them into the circuit.

1153
01:13:33,251 --> 01:13:36,610
So the other company commander now
tunes in same here, major only.

1154
01:13:36,611 --> 01:13:40,270
I know there's infantry coming in.
They're already in the road with us,

1155
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,700
so they're just about to get some,

1156
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:46,510
his voice and manner were normally
extremely quiet and easy going.

1157
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:48,910
Now his tone was strident with urgency.

1158
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:54,370
Had it been anyone but Julian
stolen the major might fought it,

1159
01:13:54,371 --> 01:13:59,230
showed near panic, okayed the both of
you. He answered as calmly as he could.

1160
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,800
Stuff's coming in here to
fight him and keep me informed.

1161
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:05,913
Okay.

1162
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:10,780
Major John's doesn't get excited
about stuff very often. He says, oh,

1163
01:14:10,781 --> 01:14:13,150
you're attack. Cool. Fight
him. Keep me informed.

1164
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:22,230
That's how you eat. Yeah. Now

1165
01:14:24,150 --> 01:14:24,983
at some point,

1166
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:28,890
all the wires that I talked about that
were so important for communication,

1167
01:14:29,610 --> 01:14:31,020
the crowd back at the aid station,

1168
01:14:31,021 --> 01:14:34,620
they had a cat and the captured a guy
cried Weddle suddenly he must have been

1169
01:14:34,621 --> 01:14:38,970
part of patrol that came through
and caught all our wires. Hell,

1170
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:41,790
there haven't been enough shells
to failing falling to cut them.

1171
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:46,230
All the smart bastards. They even
knew when we checked radios as well.

1172
01:14:46,290 --> 01:14:48,840
So these guys set,

1173
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:53,910
a small group of Germans went through the
lines are probably right after a radio

1174
01:14:53,911 --> 01:14:55,770
check caught all the wires.

1175
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:00,053
Yeah,

1176
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:05,920
that's, that's how you kick
off a, uh, an attack, right?

1177
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:08,290
You screw up their communications.

1178
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:15,310
Now at this point they are,
this is turning bad,

1179
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:18,130
real bad. And, and this is, again,

1180
01:15:18,131 --> 01:15:23,131
there's so much great information in here
and so such good documentation of way

1181
01:15:23,771 --> 01:15:28,360
this combat takes place.
But suffice it to say at this point,

1182
01:15:28,361 --> 01:15:33,010
I'm skipping forward. They are getting
really crushed. They got mass casualties.

1183
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:38,470
They are there when they advance.

1184
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:39,491
So imagine this,

1185
01:15:39,491 --> 01:15:43,700
remember I talked about the Germans know
exactly where they're mortars are going

1186
01:15:43,701 --> 01:15:44,534
to hit.

1187
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:50,010
Well the Americans will storm forward
and fight harder and get to another hedge

1188
01:15:51,451 --> 01:15:55,660
row when they get to this new
hedge row where the Germans were,

1189
01:15:55,661 --> 01:15:57,220
where they just beat the
Germans out of there.

1190
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:01,360
The Germans have that hedge
row dialed as well. So,

1191
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,160
so now as soon as they get positioned,

1192
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:06,300
they started getting immediate
effective fire from mortar.

1193
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,470
So this is a total nightmare
and that's what's happening.

1194
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:13,120
And at this point they're
completely bogged down.

1195
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:18,670
And this might be, you don't get to
hear a story like this very often.

1196
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:24,130
So the regimental executive Colonel Smith,

1197
01:16:24,131 --> 01:16:25,630
Lieutenant Colonel Smith shows up.

1198
01:16:25,631 --> 01:16:30,631
So above the chain of command of the
battalion is the regiment and the senior

1199
01:16:33,191 --> 01:16:37,480
person in the regiment is the kernel,
the regimental commander,

1200
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:39,490
and this is his executive.

1201
01:16:40,270 --> 01:16:43,360
The person that one down from the
regimental commander is this guy,

1202
01:16:43,361 --> 01:16:48,160
Lieutenant Lieutenant Colonel Smith,
and he shows up and here's what he says,

1203
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:50,920
what's the matter? John's, why
aren't you getting anywhere?

1204
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:55,570
Smith gasped and this gasp because
he's running into this position,

1205
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:59,290
the major point to the bloody trail,
to the dead men,

1206
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,770
to the shells that were savaging the
trees and finally in the direction of the

1207
01:17:02,771 --> 01:17:06,190
nearby front from which came the
plotting sound of mortar fire,

1208
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:08,620
his eyes were lacking,

1209
01:17:08,621 --> 01:17:13,370
their usual snapped and he answered
[inaudible] they're too tough.

1210
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:16,550
Smith blinked several times.

1211
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:19,760
He was obviously trying to think of
something to say something that would

1212
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:23,930
inspire this listless battalion
commander to new effort. Well,

1213
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:28,160
he finally brought out, you got to get
going right away. Regimen has got to move.

1214
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:32,480
You just got to get going.
John's shook his head.

1215
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:36,830
He wasn't having any,
not today was all he would say.

1216
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:41,570
So we're talking mentally
defeated at this point,

1217
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:44,990
and even the,
the regimental commander coming in,

1218
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:50,050
or the regimental executive
commander coming in telling him,

1219
01:17:50,601 --> 01:17:54,200
hey, you got to move. You just got to
go. Which is that, that encouragement,

1220
01:17:54,201 --> 01:17:58,040
this reminds me of,
of in Jujitsu tournaments,

1221
01:17:58,050 --> 01:18:00,500
you ever seen your coach saying like,
you got to get on top,

1222
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:04,370
you got to do something. I've got to get
out of there. Yeah, that doesn't help me.

1223
01:18:04,730 --> 01:18:08,660
So that's what he's saying. Hey you, you
just got to go. I'm getting mortared.

1224
01:18:08,690 --> 01:18:11,900
My guys are getting mowed
down. I'm not, I can't do it.

1225
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:14,570
So back to the book then.
For some reason,

1226
01:18:14,571 --> 01:18:18,710
both men looked up the hedge row
toward the rear colonel McDaniel,

1227
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:23,600
the new division chief of
staff was striding toward
them, oblivious of the fire.

1228
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,640
Just as he reached the command post,

1229
01:18:25,641 --> 01:18:28,900
a volley of four rounds screamed in
the field just beyond the headrow.

1230
01:18:29,490 --> 01:18:33,200
The concussion tumbled them into
the hole with the major and Smith.

1231
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:38,750
But MCDANIEL did not lose his natural
dignity. And he was smiling as he said,

1232
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:42,820
Hello John's Smith,
how are we doing now?

1233
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:47,420
We got a leader coming in that's very
calm and very cool and just got blasted

1234
01:18:47,421 --> 01:18:51,700
into their whole, by the way, and he looks
up smiles and says, how are we doing?

1235
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:57,050
John's made an effort to perk up a bit,
but as voice lacked conviction or forces,

1236
01:18:57,060 --> 01:19:02,000
he told McDaniel all about the situation.
The chief of staff survey the scene,

1237
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:06,230
weighing it all very carefully. It'd
be before he answered, when he did,

1238
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:09,080
his tone was serious
and he was not smiling.

1239
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:16,150
John's when you were on maneuvers in
Louisiana or at Vmi and while you were

1240
01:19:17,391 --> 01:19:18,590
studying at Leavenworth,

1241
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:22,790
you saw situations where units had to be
sacrificed knowingly in order to get a

1242
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:26,600
job done, didn't you? The
battalion commander nodded.

1243
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:31,010
When you saw those things, you probably
never thought very much about them.

1244
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:35,870
Just accepted them as a matter of course
in war, didn't you? The major nodded.

1245
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:36,704
Again,

1246
01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:42,890
you never stopped to think probably that
there might come a time when you and

1247
01:19:42,891 --> 01:19:47,180
your unit would be the one that had to
be sacrificed to enable the parent unit

1248
01:19:47,181 --> 01:19:48,380
to accomplish its mission.

1249
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:54,320
The majors eyes were opening
wider as he shook his head. Well,

1250
01:19:54,321 --> 01:19:57,320
I don't know for sure,
but maybe this is that time.

1251
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:02,600
I do know that this is the highest ground
on the core front and the key to the

1252
01:20:02,601 --> 01:20:07,601
entire defense is St Lo core
express expects us to break
it and we think you are

1253
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:12,540
the man to do the job at whatever cost.

1254
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:17,820
Now don't let us down
without another word.

1255
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:20,610
He got to his feet and
walked back the way had come.

1256
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:24,180
The regimental executive tagged after him.

1257
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:28,620
John's watched them go.
Suddenly he remembered that the general,

1258
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:33,150
what the general had said to him
the day before, I'm counting on you.

1259
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:39,320
He turned to Weddell who would watch
this little drama with detached interest.

1260
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:44,280
Leroy, the major said is he squared his
shoulders and pointed to the sinking son.

1261
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:49,140
Take a damn good look at that Sun old
boy cause it's probably the last time any

1262
01:20:49,141 --> 01:20:51,450
of us will ever see it.
Let's go.

1263
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:58,200
John's never knew later just what he
did the rest of that afternoon and early

1264
01:20:59,290 --> 01:20:59,820
evening.

1265
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:04,180
Can you remembered moving
around the command post
forward again and he knew that

1266
01:21:04,181 --> 01:21:08,830
he had needled the company commanders
unmercifully threatening them myrtle with

1267
01:21:08,831 --> 01:21:11,500
relief of their commands,
begging, pleading,

1268
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:16,120
anything he could think of that would
work with that individual. At that moment,

1269
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:21,290
he found that there was a comparatively
weak spot in the German lines.

1270
01:21:21,291 --> 01:21:22,520
Opposite Baker again,

1271
01:21:22,730 --> 01:21:26,720
he badgered Martin into persuading the
artillery to give them all the fire that

1272
01:21:26,721 --> 01:21:28,400
he could hit that spot at one time.

1273
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:32,900
That meant a lot of guns when they all
fired three rounds as fast as the gunners

1274
01:21:32,901 --> 01:21:33,734
could load them.

1275
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:38,240
A hundred yards of German held hedge
row went up in flame and smoke and dust

1276
01:21:39,290 --> 01:21:39,681
again.

1277
01:21:39,681 --> 01:21:43,760
Most of Baker companies streamed across
the field and into the gap blasted by

1278
01:21:43,761 --> 01:21:48,140
the artillery that took the heart out of
the paratroopers and the paratroopers.

1279
01:21:48,141 --> 01:21:51,680
He talking about our German paratroopers
who began to fall back all along the

1280
01:21:51,681 --> 01:21:53,870
line.
It was no route.

1281
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:59,110
The Germans retired from their flanking
threat baker post having gained a place

1282
01:21:59,691 --> 01:22:04,310
in their main line, but they fell back
slowly fighting every foot of the way.

1283
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:09,410
The tenacious paratrooper slowed the
weakness the weekend battalion again,

1284
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:11,210
but they could not stop it entirely.

1285
01:22:11,810 --> 01:22:15,710
The company commanders and the platoon
leaders together with the battalion CEO

1286
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:19,190
had thrown off their apathy,
taken a second wind,

1287
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:24,250
and we're not to be denied at dark thanks
to the inspired leadership that had

1288
01:22:24,681 --> 01:22:28,190
been provided in a few short
minutes by Colonel Mcdaniel.

1289
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:31,490
The German line was broken beyond repair.

1290
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:37,400
Battered American battalion
had made 500 bloody yards

1291
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:41,060
as dusk faded into darkness.

1292
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:46,130
That firing began to diminish only
to flare briefly again on the left.

1293
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:49,910
Then it died away into silence.
Kenny called in.

1294
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:53,480
Kenny called in to say there had been a
light counter attack on the left flank.

1295
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:55,280
He had easily kicked it off.

1296
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:59,270
The major did not ask for
permission to halt the advance.

1297
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:01,520
He gave orders to dig
in for the night after.

1298
01:23:01,521 --> 01:23:04,670
He was sure the companies had
close contact on their flanks.

1299
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:12,870
So there you go.
That

1300
01:23:17,670 --> 01:23:22,590
that's just an amazing account
of not only of leadership,

1301
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:26,970
but if what leadership was capable of.
I mean, John's was pretty much done.

1302
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:30,690
He's literally saying, not
today. They're too tough

1303
01:23:32,210 --> 01:23:37,210
in the way that make Danial convinces
him and explains to him that,

1304
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:39,440
you know,
those times,

1305
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:45,360
those times when you were doing exercises
and you why they'd sacrifice a unit to,

1306
01:23:45,361 --> 01:23:47,540
that they can accomplish the mission.
I'm not sure,

1307
01:23:47,541 --> 01:23:51,100
but I think you're that unit right now
and we're counting on you to get it done.

1308
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:56,640
Unbelievable.

1309
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:09,710
You know, that's, uh, that's
one of those things too where

1310
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:15,710
that's where you're, that's where, you
know, from a leadership perspective,

1311
01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:20,840
you are now,
you know,

1312
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:25,850
entering a situation where duty is going
to be the most important thing to you.

1313
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:27,890
And you also know that

1314
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:32,950
the mission is the most important thing.
You've got to,

1315
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:35,770
you've got to put that at the top
of your priorities. And you know,

1316
01:24:35,771 --> 01:24:38,440
you're going to sacrifice guys
and it's going to be a nightmare.

1317
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:40,510
But the alternative,

1318
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:45,220
the alternative is you're not gonna win.

1319
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:47,890
You're gonna,
you're not gonna win.

1320
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:53,460
That's the alternative is that your
team is not going to be able to achieve

1321
01:24:53,831 --> 01:24:57,280
this. And, and you know,
at this point in the war,

1322
01:24:58,060 --> 01:25:01,390
this war was not settled
yet by any stretch.

1323
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:06,840
This world was not settled.
And so to give up ground and start to,

1324
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:10,660
to let the Germans reorganize and
let them start to gain high ground,

1325
01:25:10,661 --> 01:25:12,660
which is what they were fighting for here.
Hmm.

1326
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:16,240
That's not just going to affect your mind.
It's going to affect everybody.

1327
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,450
And so I've said this
on the podcast before,

1328
01:25:19,451 --> 01:25:24,451
the definition of a team is when the
members of the team think the team is more

1329
01:25:25,121 --> 01:25:28,780
important than themselves.
And that's what you see right here.

1330
01:25:29,530 --> 01:25:33,730
They realize, John's
realize, realizes that,

1331
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:38,350
look, we're going to be, and the
title the book is Clay Pigeons.

1332
01:25:38,370 --> 01:25:41,110
You know what a clay pigeon is, right?
Yes. That's what you throw up in the air.

1333
01:25:41,111 --> 01:25:45,130
And she would add, and it's just,
it's a sacrificial piece of clay.

1334
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:49,000
And that's why the name of
the book is the clay pigeons.

1335
01:25:49,001 --> 01:25:53,260
The St Lo because that's in many cases,
the situation that they're in.

1336
01:25:53,390 --> 01:25:54,223
Yeah.

1337
01:25:59,030 --> 01:25:59,863
So this is,

1338
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:05,200
this is different then when Napoleon says,

1339
01:26:05,451 --> 01:26:08,960
Hey, if you get told to do something and
it's not smart and you do it anyways,

1340
01:26:08,961 --> 01:26:13,130
you're culpable. Yeah. John's,
he can't say, look, no,

1341
01:26:13,131 --> 01:26:17,060
this isn't smart. He knows it's the
right thing to do. He know that's,

1342
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:20,090
that's the big difference that
I'm trying to get at here.

1343
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:23,120
This isn't a guy who's saying, look, hey,

1344
01:26:23,121 --> 01:26:25,630
we're going to charge this machine gun
nest and I'm gonna lose it. You know,

1345
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:30,310
half my platoon, but it's not going
to make any big deal. And I'm a,

1346
01:26:30,490 --> 01:26:33,980
I'm a bad leader because I sacrificed
my platoon for a meaningless machine gun

1347
01:26:33,981 --> 01:26:38,540
nest. This is a guy that knows
that this objective is important,

1348
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,700
knows that this high ground is needed,

1349
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:44,240
knows that the success of this,

1350
01:26:44,630 --> 01:26:47,180
not just this mission,
but the success of this whole,

1351
01:26:47,390 --> 01:26:52,390
this whole assault on France and thereby
Germany is riding on what they're

1352
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:53,310
doing.

1353
01:26:53,310 --> 01:26:54,143
Hmm.

1354
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:57,450
Now you could break it down and
say, well, you know, they made,

1355
01:26:57,451 --> 01:26:59,220
they could hold back and they could wait.
Well,

1356
01:26:59,221 --> 01:27:02,340
what happens when you hold back and wait?
Do the Germans have meat?

1357
01:27:02,341 --> 01:27:05,070
More reinforcements that they're
sending their way that you know what's,

1358
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:10,110
what does that actually mean? And so he
is calculated. It is mine. You know what?

1359
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:14,850
We need to do this for
the good of everyone.

1360
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:16,500
We need to do this

1361
01:27:22,190 --> 01:27:24,470
at one point.

1362
01:27:24,471 --> 01:27:28,040
Now fast forwarding past some
more of that fighting. They,

1363
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:32,450
they do a good job of kind of
of the they've,

1364
01:27:32,510 --> 01:27:35,510
they've knocked out some of the,
through through some fierce fighting,

1365
01:27:35,570 --> 01:27:36,410
Dave knocked out,

1366
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:39,500
they've moved forward and they've hold
up and now they started advancing again.

1367
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:43,610
And here we go. Back to the book
of one Peter, one well-placed,

1368
01:27:43,611 --> 01:27:47,160
stubborn hostile machine guns
stopped that flank attack cold.

1369
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:50,120
So they're attacking and they get
stopped by one well placed machine gun.

1370
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:51,770
The German gunner got off,

1371
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:56,180
got half of the small squad that tried
to rush him through the smoke and the

1372
01:27:56,181 --> 01:27:59,060
attackers had to withdraw,
dragging their wounded with them.

1373
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:04,780
Mortars and artillery left the German
undamaged rifle grenades couldn't quite

1374
01:28:05,721 --> 01:28:09,170
hit the narrow slit through
which he was firing two grand.

1375
01:28:09,210 --> 01:28:11,090
And deer is trying to take extra careful.

1376
01:28:11,091 --> 01:28:14,420
Aim had also been hit by
concealed German snipers.

1377
01:28:15,410 --> 01:28:17,810
When the major arrived,
it looked as though progress.

1378
01:28:17,811 --> 01:28:22,811
It stopped using the battalion radio to
the rear command post and the artillery

1379
01:28:23,421 --> 01:28:24,410
phone.
From there,

1380
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:29,510
he adjusted 18 successive rounds from
one gun of the hundred and 10th field

1381
01:28:29,511 --> 01:28:33,560
artillery battalion in a vain attempt
to sharp shoot the machine gun out of

1382
01:28:33,561 --> 01:28:34,394
existence,

1383
01:28:35,150 --> 01:28:40,150
but he couldn't hit it and after each
round burst on or near the hedge row,

1384
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:44,210
the enemy would reply with
a dis Derisive v burst.

1385
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:50,020
There was only one answer a tank
and miraculously a tank appeared.

1386
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:56,120
So that's what I'm talking
about. He's, he tries with,

1387
01:28:56,210 --> 01:28:59,240
there's a one machine gun that's
holding up this situation.

1388
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:04,170
He gets on the radio and
cars, Terry artillery, which
is similar to mortars there.

1389
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:08,670
They're bigger and more powerful, but
it's the same thing. It's indirect fire.

1390
01:29:08,671 --> 01:29:12,900
You're putting rounds far up in the air
and then through a big arc that's going

1391
01:29:12,901 --> 01:29:15,720
thousands and thousands of feet in
some cases into the air and then coming

1392
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:17,610
basically straight down on a target.

1393
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,000
And it's when I say it's
hard to hit a target,

1394
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:26,400
he's fires 18 rounds to try and hit
this machine gun bunker to machine gun.

1395
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,320
Can't stop it,
can't help it.

1396
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:34,980
So he needs a tank and then
miraculously and, and uh,

1397
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:39,540
if you don't know anything about my
incredible affection for tanks and for

1398
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:44,541
tankers because of what they were able
to do in the battle of Ramadi too,

1399
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:50,760
not only for themselves, but to support
and save my guys time and time again.

1400
01:29:51,990 --> 01:29:56,700
I'm a big fan of tanks. In fact, I love
tanks and tankers. That's straight up.

1401
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:01,260
That's the way it is. And this is why,
this is why right here, back to the book,

1402
01:30:01,261 --> 01:30:02,490
one steel monster,

1403
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:07,110
monster lumbered up behind John's who
yelled instructions to the tank commander.

1404
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:11,940
The gunner watched carefully while in an
infantry squad beat her fire to clip of

1405
01:30:11,941 --> 01:30:16,640
tracer bullets at the slit that hid the
machine gun and then swung his short

1406
01:30:16,641 --> 01:30:19,950
boar barreled little 75 into line.

1407
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:25,290
It crashed once and almost simultaneously
with the muzzle blast came to crack of

1408
01:30:25,291 --> 01:30:28,080
white phosphorous shell.
As it hit the slit,

1409
01:30:29,010 --> 01:30:32,910
the smoke blossomed up from behind
a hedge row indicating a direct hit.

1410
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:34,920
With that,

1411
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:39,780
a single paratrooper came running
toward them a few moments later.

1412
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:41,820
Everything on the front cut loose.

1413
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:45,960
The enemy and the company charged and
another hundred yards of French real

1414
01:30:45,961 --> 01:30:47,880
estate had changed hands.

1415
01:30:50,010 --> 01:30:50,440
Okay.

1416
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:51,410
And then the major,

1417
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:55,820
the major wished every machine gunner
in his outfit could have seen that

1418
01:30:55,821 --> 01:31:00,680
position as an illustration of what
skill to nasty and guts could do to build

1419
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:04,610
and defend one machine gun position.
So

1420
01:31:06,110 --> 01:31:08,270
machine gunners tanks.

1421
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:12,083
Yeah,

1422
01:31:12,410 --> 01:31:14,170
that's incredible. What a
machine, I mean you can even,

1423
01:31:14,171 --> 01:31:17,540
you know what a machine gun is, right
between machine guns, I mean, uh, uh,

1424
01:31:17,550 --> 01:31:21,730
a normal like a mark 48 machine gun or
the old m 60 Roger Hayden talk about

1425
01:31:21,731 --> 01:31:25,510
carrying the 60. Right. And
in our boys last deployment,

1426
01:31:25,511 --> 01:31:29,360
my last deployment to Ramadi guys
are carrying mark 48 or mark 46,

1427
01:31:29,410 --> 01:31:34,330
which is a smaller round of five five
six round m 60. That's what ramble had,

1428
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:39,340
right? That is yes. And
Command. Oh by the way, okay.

1429
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:44,050
I'll take your words from the Matrix to
be exact. That was his knee. Oh, okay.

1430
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:49,360
The [inaudible], the belt fed
machine gun. Oh yeah. They're,

1431
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:52,600
they're not that big of a weapon. I mean,
it's big and blood true. Believe me,

1432
01:31:52,601 --> 01:31:55,450
when you're carrying an 802,000 rounds,
it's big enough.

1433
01:31:56,020 --> 01:31:58,010
But if you think about a whole,
you know,

1434
01:31:58,011 --> 01:32:02,740
a battalion worth guys are getting stopped
by a guy in a machine gun in a good

1435
01:32:02,741 --> 01:32:05,320
position. Now he had snipers,
snipers covering him.

1436
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:09,910
Two snipers apparently recovered him. But
that's, that's, that's not many people.

1437
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:13,240
That's why when you're on the offense,

1438
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:18,250
you need more people then being in a
defense position, you know, a defect.

1439
01:32:18,330 --> 01:32:21,010
When you're in a defense defensive
position and you're allowed to,

1440
01:32:21,011 --> 01:32:24,700
you have time to set up. That's why when
you go back to, well, when you look at,

1441
01:32:24,701 --> 01:32:28,510
normally when you look at this whole,
if you look at World War II as a whole,

1442
01:32:30,010 --> 01:32:33,880
both the the allies in what we did in,
in Normandy,

1443
01:32:33,940 --> 01:32:37,810
taking the beaches and what you
did every time in a Pacific,

1444
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:42,690
taking the beaches, you're going against
bunkered positions like this fully,

1445
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:47,740
and it's just incredible the tenacity
that it takes to make this happen.

1446
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:50,620
Yeah. Isn't that the whole, in a way,

1447
01:32:50,621 --> 01:32:53,770
the whole idea behind behind guerrilla
warfare where it's like we're just,

1448
01:32:53,771 --> 01:32:55,730
we're kind of fighting,
we're not fighting it,

1449
01:32:55,731 --> 01:32:58,130
and then all of a sudden we're
finding that that is the,

1450
01:32:58,131 --> 01:33:01,820
that is behind guerrilla warfare, but
this isn't guerrilla warfare. Yeah.

1451
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:06,000
Even without even without sneaking
around. Right, right. You're,

1452
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:10,390
you're in a uniformed soldier,
German and you go, okay,

1453
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:14,650
I'm going to set up a bunkered position
on this high ground it where I have the

1454
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:18,460
enemy channelized in this area and I have
good spread on them and the only weak

1455
01:33:18,461 --> 01:33:20,900
spots I've got, I'm going to
cover him with snipers. Yeah.

1456
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:25,330
Three people holding up a battalion
and just think, you know, if he,

1457
01:33:25,331 --> 01:33:26,920
if then once you get that position,

1458
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:30,580
we have mortars already dialed in when
you get there that are going to start

1459
01:33:30,581 --> 01:33:34,150
hitting you and then the next thing
you do is you got to move again. Well,

1460
01:33:34,151 --> 01:33:35,310
guess what? We got another three, four,

1461
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:38,680
five guys in machine gun positions
mutually supporting each other.

1462
01:33:39,860 --> 01:33:40,693
Yeah.

1463
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:42,080
That's why this,
this,

1464
01:33:42,081 --> 01:33:46,610
these American allied fighting forces
and the Americans here and the Americans

1465
01:33:46,970 --> 01:33:51,970
in the Pacific going against hardened
bunkered positions is incredible.

1466
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:53,690
Yeah,
it's incredible.

1467
01:33:58,660 --> 01:34:03,280
Now he's given kind of an overview
of war and end. Here we go.

1468
01:34:03,730 --> 01:34:08,260
Thus goes battle, a rush,
a pause, some creeping,

1469
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:12,790
a few isolated shots here and there.
Some artillery fire, some mortars,

1470
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:17,290
some smoke more creeping, another
pause, dead silence, more firing,

1471
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:20,800
a great concentration of fire
followed by a concerted rush.

1472
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:25,510
Then the whole process starts all over
again. The defender, this is good.

1473
01:34:25,511 --> 01:34:30,340
This is good information. The defender
will almost always hold out some reserve,

1474
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:34,930
even though his front line is being
torn to bits. At least he should.

1475
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:40,030
He may inflict all the damage on the
attacker that he can while giving ground

1476
01:34:40,031 --> 01:34:40,864
slowly.

1477
01:34:41,350 --> 01:34:46,350
Then when he thinks the
attacker is weakening or when
the defense has reached a

1478
01:34:46,511 --> 01:34:50,230
certain piece of ground that the
defender has chosen for the purpose,

1479
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:52,990
he launches a counter
attack with his reserves.

1480
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:57,680
The attacker has used much of
his strength. His men are tired,

1481
01:34:57,681 --> 01:35:02,660
probably short of ammunition and are
almost inevitably somewhat disorganized.

1482
01:35:03,710 --> 01:35:08,390
Then the defender throws fresh troops
into a counter attack. Overground his men,

1483
01:35:08,450 --> 01:35:12,600
no,
unless the attackers are very strong,

1484
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:17,960
they must inevitably suffer often than
they are defeated and thrown back or

1485
01:35:18,241 --> 01:35:22,110
destroyed. So there, there you go. I
mean this happens in mixed martial arts.

1486
01:35:22,111 --> 01:35:23,220
It happens in sports,

1487
01:35:23,221 --> 01:35:27,030
it happens on the battlefield and these
guys are pushing forward on the attack

1488
01:35:27,031 --> 01:35:29,700
and you take away leaves,
you chip away at them a little bit,

1489
01:35:29,701 --> 01:35:31,440
you give them ground,
you give them ground and then when they,

1490
01:35:31,710 --> 01:35:34,080
when they get spread out,
they're low on ammunition, boom.

1491
01:35:34,081 --> 01:35:36,390
Then you hit them on a counter attack
on ground that you already know

1492
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:38,920
back to the book.

1493
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:42,360
Such counter attack tactics have been
standard almost as long as there have been

1494
01:35:42,361 --> 01:35:43,440
organized armies.

1495
01:35:44,190 --> 01:35:47,700
The Germans employed them so regularly
that they were never a surprise,

1496
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:50,730
but the enemy could never muster,

1497
01:35:50,731 --> 01:35:53,880
seem to muster the strength necessary
to make their counter attacks stick.

1498
01:35:54,270 --> 01:35:58,590
Their efforts often hold it in
advance as they had the night before,

1499
01:35:58,740 --> 01:36:00,990
but they rarely gained back any ground.

1500
01:36:00,991 --> 01:36:04,020
And we're almost always costly
to the counter attackers.

1501
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:09,920
Even the best and most proven tactics
still require judgment and the force to do

1502
01:36:10,081 --> 01:36:13,410
the job.
The Germans rarely had enough of ether,

1503
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:18,930
so there's a little breakdown on what's
happening with the Germans. First of all,

1504
01:36:18,931 --> 01:36:21,300
we're not using good judgment, they're
just like standard operating procedure.

1505
01:36:21,301 --> 01:36:22,950
We're going to counter
attack every single time.

1506
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:24,630
And when you count her as accurate,
taking losses,

1507
01:36:24,631 --> 01:36:28,200
especially if you're not gaining ground,
so their standard operating procedure,

1508
01:36:28,201 --> 01:36:30,480
we're going to counter attack
and they're not gaining ground.

1509
01:36:30,510 --> 01:36:31,860
And so were they doing,
they're losing guys.

1510
01:36:34,610 --> 01:36:35,600
And the more guys you lose,

1511
01:36:35,601 --> 01:36:38,010
the less guys you have to counter
attack with the next time. Yeah.

1512
01:36:41,210 --> 01:36:44,690
Now
they had a,

1513
01:36:44,930 --> 01:36:49,930
they had a group here that
was working in the battalion.

1514
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:53,720
They were called the commandos.

1515
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:55,850
It was just like a little elite
group that they were using.

1516
01:36:55,970 --> 01:36:58,640
They would guard the command post,
but then they would also,

1517
01:36:58,641 --> 01:37:00,770
when someone's going down,
they'd get out there and get after it.

1518
01:37:00,771 --> 01:37:01,610
Super aggressive,

1519
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:07,040
but they were running so low on people
that they needed to put the commandos

1520
01:37:07,670 --> 01:37:10,810
team back out into the companies,
the regular companies.

1521
01:37:10,811 --> 01:37:12,890
So there had been a little commando unit,

1522
01:37:12,891 --> 01:37:14,690
a little special unit
within the battalion,

1523
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:17,600
and then they had to take those
guys and put them back out with the,

1524
01:37:17,630 --> 01:37:18,680
with the regular companies.

1525
01:37:19,850 --> 01:37:22,670
Now here we go back to the book
in the middle of the afternoon,

1526
01:37:22,671 --> 01:37:26,870
the CEO moved up close behind a company
to watch their contingent of former

1527
01:37:26,871 --> 01:37:31,250
battalion commandos go into the line.
Sergeant Turner,

1528
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:35,010
who had made it, who had been in
charge of a platoon of the command,

1529
01:37:35,011 --> 01:37:39,980
a platoon was with them seeing the major.
He fell behind long enough to say,

1530
01:37:40,130 --> 01:37:40,820
sir,

1531
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:44,330
we're going in there to help our buddies
from old a company lick the hell out of

1532
01:37:44,331 --> 01:37:46,730
those bastards,
but when we get through this,

1533
01:37:46,850 --> 01:37:49,550
I'd sure like to come back and get
it into a bunch of commando's for the

1534
01:37:49,551 --> 01:37:53,240
battalion is cool.
Voice ended on a rising note.

1535
01:37:54,530 --> 01:37:55,530
All right,
sergeant,

1536
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:59,430
you go to send to St Lo and I'll promise
you get another platoon or your hell

1537
01:37:59,431 --> 01:38:01,980
raisers just as soon as we can
spare them from the companies.

1538
01:38:02,850 --> 01:38:04,530
John's returned to the sergeants.

1539
01:38:04,710 --> 01:38:08,820
John's returned to sergeant salutes and
watched the man as he ran to catch up

1540
01:38:08,821 --> 01:38:12,840
with the others. An hour later, a weasel,

1541
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:18,470
which is a small purpose tracked vehicle
flying a Red Cross flag clattered out

1542
01:38:19,591 --> 01:38:22,320
of the woods carrying a
load of wounded on litters.

1543
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:27,960
The battalion commander who was passing
the spot stopped when he saw the wounded.

1544
01:38:29,010 --> 01:38:32,220
The little commando sergeant lay
on the litter on the near side,

1545
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:35,460
seeing the major.
He yelled for the driver to stop.

1546
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:38,550
John's went over to him and the boy,

1547
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:42,450
both his legs wrapped and
dirty bloody bandages,

1548
01:38:42,451 --> 01:38:46,500
grabbed his commander shirt and
pulled himself up on the litter.

1549
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:52,520
He was crying openly and unashamedly as
he burst out with a flood of invective,

1550
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:59,070
they got all my boys made
sure we didn't get off the LD,

1551
01:38:59,130 --> 01:39:03,270
which is the line of departure. I
let you down major, I let you down.

1552
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:08,790
He stopped and sobbed bitterly before
you could go on major John's could feel

1553
01:39:08,791 --> 01:39:13,230
his own throat constricting as he held
the tightly gripping hands that shook him

1554
01:39:13,231 --> 01:39:17,400
again and again as the sergeant poured
out his grief and rage and disappointment,

1555
01:39:18,630 --> 01:39:23,460
we had to get that gun. Damn the
dirty bastards. God Damn God. Damn.

1556
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:27,630
I let him get me with a fucking machine
gun and they got all my boys too.

1557
01:39:27,930 --> 01:39:28,763
God Damn.

1558
01:39:30,090 --> 01:39:34,890
He sobbed uncontrollably while the
weasel driver began to let us clutch take

1559
01:39:34,891 --> 01:39:37,800
hold, but I'll be back major, sir.

1560
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:42,510
I'll be back probably back. Sure. Boy,

1561
01:39:43,170 --> 01:39:46,860
and I'll have your old job for you anytime
you just take it easy and get those

1562
01:39:46,861 --> 01:39:50,850
legs fixed. The major was
walking slowly beside the litter.

1563
01:39:51,090 --> 01:39:53,730
Trying to gently disengage
the grip on his shirt.

1564
01:39:54,870 --> 01:39:58,470
The sergeant let go and fell
back on the litter exhausted.

1565
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:02,880
John's looked up at the aid
man who slowly shook his head.

1566
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:06,150
The sergeant would not be back.

1567
01:40:18,110 --> 01:40:23,110
Now they are finally pushing into
St Lo and and they have to go down.

1568
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:30,680
This direction of attack that
they're taking is down this

1569
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:32,631
down,

1570
01:40:32,631 --> 01:40:37,631
this single road that heads into St
Lo and the Germans have it dialed.

1571
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:42,320
They have it dialed with range,
you know,

1572
01:40:42,321 --> 01:40:47,090
with artillery ready to hit it
and here we go. They have hit it.

1573
01:40:47,091 --> 01:40:50,210
They're starting to hit it with
big rounds. Back to the book.

1574
01:40:50,211 --> 01:40:53,210
John's noted that the German
fire was coming in slowly.

1575
01:40:53,860 --> 01:40:58,420
There couldn't have been more than two
or three guns firing as they were all big

1576
01:40:58,421 --> 01:41:02,140
ones. They didn't fire
rapidly. That was a break,

1577
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:04,990
but just one of those big
shells in the wrong place.

1578
01:41:05,890 --> 01:41:10,180
As the next one began to how the men
began to look for deeper spots in the

1579
01:41:10,181 --> 01:41:13,930
ditches, John's yelled, keep
going, dammit. It's not here yet.

1580
01:41:14,530 --> 01:41:18,520
The men kept going forward for several
more seconds running hard. Now.

1581
01:41:18,940 --> 01:41:22,840
The shell was nearly on the ground
before the major yelled again down.

1582
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:26,220
Although the men hit the ditches.

1583
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:29,610
John was too excited to remember
he was in the middle of the road.

1584
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:34,440
He went down on one knee. The shell
burst a hundred yards ahead. Again,

1585
01:41:34,441 --> 01:41:39,000
nobody was hit. The incident at burst,
the major was up, yelling, let's go.

1586
01:41:39,090 --> 01:41:40,170
Running is he yelled,

1587
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:45,740
his men got up and ran to Hoffman and
grist mill or grim cell catching the idea

1588
01:41:47,850 --> 01:41:52,850
moved further back down the line of men
to relate commands and call signals on

1589
01:41:53,161 --> 01:41:57,240
the shells. When the next one hit,
all three officers did the same.

1590
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:03,200
None of them got off the road here and
they're non coms without orders began to

1591
01:42:03,481 --> 01:42:07,620
fill in the gap staying on
the road themselves. By the
time the third shale hit,

1592
01:42:07,621 --> 01:42:11,430
the whole column was working as smoothly
as if it had been on a parade ground

1593
01:42:11,431 --> 01:42:15,810
drill and they were losing no time.
They kept going. A few men were hit,

1594
01:42:15,811 --> 01:42:18,450
but not many. Oddly, oddly enough,

1595
01:42:18,451 --> 01:42:21,270
not an officer or non-com was knocked
out of the middle of the road.

1596
01:42:21,450 --> 01:42:25,680
Though each leader only went down
on one knee. One Shell burst,

1597
01:42:25,681 --> 01:42:28,800
not 25 yards ahead of the major,

1598
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:33,540
but it hit just around a small bend in
the road and he was sheltered by the bank.

1599
01:42:34,290 --> 01:42:38,850
He ran forward through the smoke and
dust nearly falling over a man who is

1600
01:42:38,851 --> 01:42:41,730
rolling crazily half in
and half out of the ditch.

1601
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:45,810
John's grabbed him by the arm to help
him to his feet crying. Come on boy,

1602
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:50,580
let's go. The man tried to get up,
but stumbled awkwardly forward.

1603
01:42:51,330 --> 01:42:55,080
Only then did John's look down and
see that the soldier had no feet.

1604
01:42:56,280 --> 01:43:00,000
He was trying valiantly to stand
on the stumps of his two legs,

1605
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:04,080
whereas feet had been sliced
cleanly off just at the ankles.

1606
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:08,640
John's laid him back gently into
the ditch and changed his tone.

1607
01:43:08,790 --> 01:43:10,710
Maybe you better take it easy while son,

1608
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:13,230
you stay here until one
of your buddies gets here.

1609
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:14,910
There'll be a long in a minute.

1610
01:43:16,820 --> 01:43:19,730
The man himself was an aid man
and not another was insight,

1611
01:43:19,850 --> 01:43:22,910
but the battalion commander
had no time for one man.

1612
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:27,440
So after a quick look to see that the
stumps were not bleeding profusely,

1613
01:43:27,650 --> 01:43:30,350
he patted the man on the back saying,
see you later bud.

1614
01:43:31,430 --> 01:43:36,430
Then he ran to catch up to his place
in the column a little further down the

1615
01:43:36,591 --> 01:43:40,040
road. After another burst, he saw
another man lying in the ditch,

1616
01:43:40,130 --> 01:43:43,700
not making any move to get up and go
have though he didn't seem to be hurt.

1617
01:43:45,050 --> 01:43:49,250
John Stopped, grabbed him by the
arm and yelled again, come on,

1618
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:53,270
let's get going.
Looking blankly up at him.

1619
01:43:53,330 --> 01:43:56,600
The soldier pushed a camera
forward saying, plaintiff Lee,

1620
01:43:57,050 --> 01:44:00,830
I'm a camera man.
This rock the major for a moment.

1621
01:44:01,890 --> 01:44:06,560
Then he said, well, you can't take
any pictures in that ditch. Get going.

1622
01:44:13,570 --> 01:44:18,490
So again, you see leadership in
action. You see him having to exit,

1623
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:22,870
actually lead and set the
example and his other,

1624
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:27,490
the company commanders and eventually
the the senior enlisted guys all follow

1625
01:44:27,491 --> 01:44:31,790
his lead of what he's doing. We got
time to run. We got a minute of water,

1626
01:44:31,791 --> 01:44:33,700
whatever it is, 30 seconds,
we're going to get up.

1627
01:44:33,701 --> 01:44:35,410
We're going to run as hard as we can.
When we,

1628
01:44:35,411 --> 01:44:36,820
when we know we're going
to get hit with a shell,

1629
01:44:36,821 --> 01:44:40,810
we're going to get down and take cover
pure leadership.

1630
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:49,130
Now once they get kind of into st low,
there's a kernel shows up,

1631
01:44:49,670 --> 01:44:53,330
starts getting told what to do. Back to
the book, the colonel was giving orders.

1632
01:44:53,331 --> 01:44:55,400
Again, I want you to clear this
town as quickly as you can.

1633
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:59,090
There aren't many Germans in it, but
there are a few and I want it all clear.

1634
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:02,180
Your battalion is the only infantry
we have with the task force.

1635
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:05,480
As you are the ranking officer, you will
be in command of all the troops in town.

1636
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:09,410
He looked closely at the major who nodded,
trying to contain the elation.

1637
01:45:09,411 --> 01:45:12,380
He felt knowing that he would have
command on the ground of what would

1638
01:45:12,381 --> 01:45:17,270
undoubtedly be a historical action.
The colonel thrust a map at him.

1639
01:45:17,450 --> 01:45:21,740
Here's a large scale map of the
town itself. Now get going. Major.

1640
01:45:21,741 --> 01:45:24,980
John's turned to look for
Wendell Weddle and Greg Muscle.

1641
01:45:27,190 --> 01:45:31,900
His two staff officers turned
company commanders both.
We're almost at his elbow.

1642
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:35,080
He drew them to one side and
divided the town between them.

1643
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:38,560
So now they're kind of on the outskirts
of St Lo and they're starting to clear

1644
01:45:38,561 --> 01:45:39,394
the town.

1645
01:45:40,780 --> 01:45:44,440
And we have seen the companies go out
and start clearing the town and they've

1646
01:45:44,441 --> 01:45:48,550
set up a little make shift
command post for, for major Johns.

1647
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:52,480
And, and he's standing
there with, he's got these,

1648
01:45:52,481 --> 01:45:56,500
got a bunch of new guys with him too.
He's got all these replacements.

1649
01:45:56,501 --> 01:46:00,460
Because remember on an hour and
a half ago when I said, hey,

1650
01:46:00,461 --> 01:46:02,470
these guys have already
had 300 replacements.

1651
01:46:02,471 --> 01:46:05,500
Well that has kept up the whole time.
They're getting all these replacements.

1652
01:46:05,501 --> 01:46:08,410
So at this point, this is an
interesting leadership story here.

1653
01:46:08,411 --> 01:46:11,650
He's got some new guys that show up and

1654
01:46:13,490 --> 01:46:16,570
there's, he's standing in his new
command post and these new guys,

1655
01:46:16,571 --> 01:46:20,770
he sees like a position that needs
to be taken to make sure that,

1656
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:25,540
you know, we, we have some security around
the command post. And so here we go.

1657
01:46:25,541 --> 01:46:29,500
He motioned to the PFC and three other
men standing nearby, they came forward,

1658
01:46:29,501 --> 01:46:32,860
rifles ready. So these are three new
guys. Just replacements. Just showed up.

1659
01:46:32,930 --> 01:46:33,763
Hmm.

1660
01:46:35,100 --> 01:46:35,550
And again,

1661
01:46:35,550 --> 01:46:38,760
the probably the most fire they've seen
was running into the town of St Lo,

1662
01:46:38,761 --> 01:46:42,960
avoiding big giant how it's or shells
that are hitting him back to the book.

1663
01:46:42,961 --> 01:46:44,640
See that alley there said John's pointing.

1664
01:46:44,910 --> 01:46:47,210
I want you to take these three
men and go down to the end of it.

1665
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:50,940
Looks like about a hundred yards where
you will set an outpost Lieutenant

1666
01:46:50,940 --> 01:46:54,060
Lickeri. We'll come around
later to see how you're doing.

1667
01:46:54,540 --> 01:46:56,310
The PFC squinted down the alley,

1668
01:46:56,460 --> 01:46:59,940
nodded a trifle uncertainly
and started toward it.

1669
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:03,630
The others followed but the
major was too preoccupied,

1670
01:47:03,990 --> 01:47:07,200
preoccupied to note that there have
been no briefing and no assignment of

1671
01:47:07,201 --> 01:47:08,250
positions or duties.

1672
01:47:08,370 --> 01:47:11,820
They just trooped off down the alley
together like a bunch of men going to the

1673
01:47:11,821 --> 01:47:12,960
post exchange.

1674
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:18,420
Two minutes after they left the sound
of German machine gun fire came from the

1675
01:47:18,421 --> 01:47:19,920
direction of the narrow passageway.

1676
01:47:20,430 --> 01:47:24,810
John's turned to look out of the alley
pelted the four men straight toward them.

1677
01:47:25,050 --> 01:47:28,530
The private first class panted sir,
there's a machine gun down there.

1678
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:33,120
The battalion commander didn't
know whether to be amused or angry.

1679
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:37,260
There was no telling what the new men
were apt to do if they didn't have

1680
01:47:37,261 --> 01:47:40,920
leadership of an experienced are
well trained non-com or officer.

1681
01:47:41,910 --> 01:47:45,210
He decided to be gentle. Yes, I heard it.

1682
01:47:46,170 --> 01:47:47,610
Now tell you what to do.

1683
01:47:48,390 --> 01:47:52,290
You take these three men again assign one
to take a place where he can shoot the

1684
01:47:52,291 --> 01:47:54,600
gun or where you think the gun is.

1685
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:58,950
Then take the other two and see if you
can't come around behind it and get it

1686
01:47:58,951 --> 01:48:03,520
for me so they'll cover move. It was
real simple. Look, cover, move you.

1687
01:48:03,530 --> 01:48:05,940
You get where you can shoot the gun,
have that guy get,

1688
01:48:05,941 --> 01:48:09,300
we're going to shoot the gun and then
you guys maneuver behind. Cover move.

1689
01:48:09,450 --> 01:48:12,750
Beautiful.
The PFC took that in,

1690
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:16,080
nodded somewhat less uncertainly

1691
01:48:17,580 --> 01:48:21,900
motion to the men to follow
him and started purposefully
back down the alley and

1692
01:48:21,901 --> 01:48:24,390
not more than five minutes.
There came in rapid succession,

1693
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:28,590
the sound of the machine gun, a few rifle
shots, two grenades and running feet.

1694
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:32,370
John's had moved across the street
looking for the best place for a temporary

1695
01:48:32,371 --> 01:48:33,204
command post.

1696
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,970
He turned toward the mouth of the
alley wondering what would come out.

1697
01:48:35,971 --> 01:48:40,971
This time to Germans showed first running
toward him at full speed before the

1698
01:48:42,061 --> 01:48:43,800
major could bring a sub machine gun up.

1699
01:48:44,010 --> 01:48:48,480
He saw the PFC and one other man prodding
the Germans from behind with bayonets.

1700
01:48:49,620 --> 01:48:52,980
They spotted him and poked
the prisoner in his direction.

1701
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:58,400
They stopped in front of him before he
noticed the MG 34 the PFC was dragging

1702
01:48:58,741 --> 01:49:01,530
behind him, so they actually
had the German machine gun.

1703
01:49:03,660 --> 01:49:07,620
The man dropped the gun in front of him
saying, here's the gun you wanted major,

1704
01:49:08,250 --> 01:49:12,000
but this is all that's left to the
crew. We had to kill two of them, sir.

1705
01:49:13,050 --> 01:49:18,050
Major John's gulped nodded and motion to
gay was another one of the guys to come

1706
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:19,140
to get the prisoners,

1707
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:23,520
the private first class and his helpers
jog back toward their new outpost.

1708
01:49:24,180 --> 01:49:25,440
The major looked after them,

1709
01:49:25,650 --> 01:49:29,610
wondering just what sort of training or
indoctrination they must've had first to

1710
01:49:29,611 --> 01:49:32,100
run away from an enemy
without trying to fight back.

1711
01:49:32,220 --> 01:49:34,440
And then to apologize
for having killed too.

1712
01:49:35,580 --> 01:49:39,990
He looked down at the German that the
batter German machine gun kicked it idly

1713
01:49:40,230 --> 01:49:44,790
and reminded himself to be more
careful in issuing orders to new men.

1714
01:49:45,810 --> 01:49:48,910
They were apt to take things
a bit on the literal side.

1715
01:49:49,990 --> 01:49:52,450
He was sure that the
PFC had actually fought,

1716
01:49:52,451 --> 01:49:57,250
that the CEO himself had a personal desire
for the machine gun they had knocked

1717
01:49:57,251 --> 01:50:01,840
out and they would have gone to any ends
to retrieve the gun itself in order to

1718
01:50:01,841 --> 01:50:02,674
bring it back.

1719
01:50:02,740 --> 01:50:07,690
Just because the major had added that
for me when he ordered them to get the

1720
01:50:07,691 --> 01:50:08,524
gun.

1721
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:14,060
Yeah. That's like a common thing to
kind of add. Right? Like in, you know,

1722
01:50:15,530 --> 01:50:19,370
back when he used to work at the
nightclub, you'd hear that all the time,

1723
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,330
especially when you're
managing big crowds. So you
say, Hey, can you, you know,

1724
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:26,150
can you slide over on the side here
for me? And they'd always add the,

1725
01:50:26,151 --> 01:50:30,140
for me always thought like that's
kind of strange thing to add. I mean,

1726
01:50:30,141 --> 01:50:32,570
it's so common,
but when you really think about it,

1727
01:50:32,571 --> 01:50:34,640
it's like that kind of
a strange thing to add,

1728
01:50:34,641 --> 01:50:38,720
but I think it adds like this
personal touch too personal.

1729
01:50:43,030 --> 01:50:43,850
All right,

1730
01:50:43,850 --> 01:50:47,480
now he's in the command post Weddle
who's one of the company commanders.

1731
01:50:47,490 --> 01:50:51,590
These guys were out clearing the
city and he hears some commotion,

1732
01:50:51,650 --> 01:50:55,730
comes back into one of the rooms and
Weddles in there with one of the other

1733
01:50:55,731 --> 01:50:59,450
officers or one of the other, uh, yeah,
officer's in there working on them.

1734
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:00,921
Back to the book,

1735
01:51:00,921 --> 01:51:05,360
Brooks sobbing was carefully cutting away
the officer's field jacket and shirt,

1736
01:51:05,361 --> 01:51:08,150
exposing a wide deep gas
just below the shoulder.

1737
01:51:08,780 --> 01:51:11,390
John Stomach turned over
quickly when he saw the wound,

1738
01:51:12,140 --> 01:51:15,560
the bone was shattered
with sharp, splintered and
sticking through the bloody,

1739
01:51:15,561 --> 01:51:19,180
pulpy massive torn flesh.
That's,

1740
01:51:19,190 --> 01:51:21,860
this is wet at least talking
about when was damn near right.

1741
01:51:22,150 --> 01:51:26,210
They don't almost blowed his
arm plum off the s three moaned,

1742
01:51:26,211 --> 01:51:31,211
closed his eyes as he leaned back to let
Brooks duty could with a nasty wound,

1743
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:37,880
but he pulled himself together in a moment
or two and opened his eyes to look at

1744
01:51:37,881 --> 01:51:42,470
the CEO. So here he is Weddles
just in agony, but he gets,

1745
01:51:42,471 --> 01:51:46,000
gets a grip. Then he looks at the
CEO, squeezes his eyes together,

1746
01:51:46,010 --> 01:51:48,350
hard than looks at the CEO and says,

1747
01:51:48,351 --> 01:51:52,520
I was just coming back to tell you he'd
ground out between clenched teeth that

1748
01:51:52,521 --> 01:51:56,120
we have our side of the town all
clear with the men out on the edge.

1749
01:51:56,240 --> 01:52:00,380
When the artillery caught me in the
middle of the street, he flinched.

1750
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:02,180
His face twisted in pain.

1751
01:52:02,181 --> 01:52:06,290
When the aid man who had taken over from
Brooks inadvertently twisted his arm as

1752
01:52:06,291 --> 01:52:08,660
he sprinklered soulful
powder into the wound,

1753
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:11,630
then he went on Chadwick his back.

1754
01:52:12,530 --> 01:52:14,660
Didn't know it until I saw him came up,

1755
01:52:14,661 --> 01:52:18,650
just came just before we pulled out out
of the little road back up the hill.

1756
01:52:19,070 --> 01:52:23,090
You can put them in command. He's
good. He was gasping at the words.

1757
01:52:23,091 --> 01:52:27,350
Now Major, can you get me Outta
here? I don't want to lose this arm.

1758
01:52:28,310 --> 01:52:32,780
Sure. Boy, we'll get you out. Just try
to relax now. Don't worry about it.

1759
01:52:33,020 --> 01:52:36,020
Take it easy and we'll have you back to
where they can fix it. Up in no time.

1760
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:43,980
Weddle leaned heavily on Brooks,

1761
01:52:43,981 --> 01:52:47,630
who was still sobbing from the shock
of seeing his captain so badly wounded.

1762
01:52:48,220 --> 01:52:50,720
Weddle and Brooks had been
together a long time and major new,

1763
01:52:50,721 --> 01:52:54,530
the sergeant would be no good
around the command post for awhile.

1764
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:57,890
So we motioned him to go along
and look after the wounded s three

1765
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:01,250
so again,
you know,

1766
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:06,400
Major Jones realizes that somebody at
their capacity for handling the horrors of

1767
01:53:06,591 --> 01:53:09,140
war and says, Hey, you take this
guy back to the aid station. Yeah,

1768
01:53:10,930 --> 01:53:11,763
okay,

1769
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:15,750
now there's a German counter
attacks or they're in St Lo.

1770
01:53:15,751 --> 01:53:17,250
The Gut things decently handled,

1771
01:53:17,251 --> 01:53:19,800
but all of a sudden they start seeing
it and there's a guy in the field named

1772
01:53:19,801 --> 01:53:22,140
Barnes and he starting to report back day.
They're,

1773
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:27,200
they're forming up a big counter attack
and also their field phones or been on

1774
01:53:29,070 --> 01:53:32,010
the last wires.
So they're don't have good communications.

1775
01:53:32,011 --> 01:53:34,440
They see this thing forming up. They're
going to be overwhelmed. They're,

1776
01:53:34,441 --> 01:53:36,510
they're really under man's St
Louis is a pretty big city.

1777
01:53:36,511 --> 01:53:38,370
It's all kind of destroyed,

1778
01:53:38,371 --> 01:53:41,730
but it's still too big for the
amount of people that they have.

1779
01:53:42,780 --> 01:53:45,410
And so they're really scared that there's
gonna be a big counter and the terms

1780
01:53:45,411 --> 01:53:49,470
are going to take the city back.
So the finally get through.

1781
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:50,790
They don't even know
who they're talking to,

1782
01:53:50,791 --> 01:53:53,850
they're just trying to get through to
somebody that can pass word to get the

1783
01:53:53,851 --> 01:53:58,830
artillery just start dropping bombs.
And Henderson is one of the guys on the,

1784
01:53:58,860 --> 01:54:01,470
on the radio and he says,
damn it man,

1785
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:04,520
this is the goon red and St Lo when
we've needed artillery is worse than the

1786
01:54:04,521 --> 01:54:07,890
ever needed anything and all our
lives when we need it right now,

1787
01:54:08,130 --> 01:54:13,130
all our lines are rear all our lines to
the rear out and our wire people spliced

1788
01:54:13,201 --> 01:54:14,070
one and got you.

1789
01:54:14,130 --> 01:54:17,740
Now quit asking damn fool questions and
tell me if you can shoot for us in St Lo.

1790
01:54:18,430 --> 01:54:19,890
So this is going back and forth.

1791
01:54:19,891 --> 01:54:23,450
They start dropping bombs and all of
a sudden they start adjusting the,

1792
01:54:23,650 --> 01:54:27,000
the bombing closer and closer to them,
to their own lines.

1793
01:54:27,690 --> 01:54:30,870
Back to the book Angel Fire Direction
Center was questioning the adjustment.

1794
01:54:31,590 --> 01:54:33,810
The correction would
bring the shells inside.

1795
01:54:33,811 --> 01:54:36,150
The no fire line may
be on friendly troops.

1796
01:54:38,350 --> 01:54:42,370
Hell yes. We got doze on the edge of
town. Who Do you think wants this stuff?

1797
01:54:42,371 --> 01:54:46,360
Anyways, the artillery man was
frantic, afraid of the safety rules.

1798
01:54:46,361 --> 01:54:50,410
The big guns would make them stop
them just when they needed the most.

1799
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:52,930
Please sir. He pleaded,
just put it out there.

1800
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:56,860
The Infantry Battalion
Commander is standing right
beside me praying for more of

1801
01:54:56,861 --> 01:55:00,640
it. The last of all, he was right in
there, but the Germans are still coming.

1802
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:06,220
They stand the, they get them to
drop more bombs, bombs and Barnes.

1803
01:55:06,221 --> 01:55:10,030
The guys out in the field calls back in
again. That was marvelous. Do it again,

1804
01:55:10,031 --> 01:55:14,440
some more. And then the guys
transfer in that repeat range.

1805
01:55:14,441 --> 01:55:16,780
Fire for effect.
Give us all your hand and give it quick.

1806
01:55:16,900 --> 01:55:19,840
You're breaking up the
attack and you're all we have

1807
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:27,070
and that's enough.
That's dead.

1808
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:31,790
They bombed the bejesus
out of the Germans,

1809
01:55:32,180 --> 01:55:35,360
and that pretty much breaks the attack.
And again,

1810
01:55:35,660 --> 01:55:40,280
I'm summing up like seven
pages of extended combat.

1811
01:55:41,420 --> 01:55:44,700
Uh, and finally though, the,

1812
01:55:44,850 --> 01:55:49,850
the battle is for the most part
over and they've got stabilized.

1813
01:55:50,521 --> 01:55:52,110
They kind of set some security.

1814
01:55:52,111 --> 01:55:55,860
And here we go back to the book major
John's his face in his hands as he sat

1815
01:55:55,861 --> 01:55:57,390
down for the first time in hours,

1816
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:02,100
he couldn't help thinking of the
deaf and agony to so many men.

1817
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:07,160
So needlessly it hurt
damnably deep inside.

1818
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:09,173
Yeah.

1819
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:16,520
And then a liaison officer
for them regiment came in
with a lieutenant colonel,

1820
01:56:16,740 --> 01:56:19,440
his staff,
and all of his company commanders.

1821
01:56:19,620 --> 01:56:23,280
They were from the hundred and
34th regiment of the 35th division,

1822
01:56:23,370 --> 01:56:28,110
which was to relieve the first battalion
at once. John's could hardly believe it.

1823
01:56:28,350 --> 01:56:32,010
Even when he saw his replacement standing
there looking fresh and confident,

1824
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:36,030
he was beginning to think that clay
pigeons were supposed to go on forever

1825
01:56:36,150 --> 01:56:38,790
fighting all alone,
except for the artillery.

1826
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:46,660
The new battalion commander wondered
about Major Stat Major John Staff.

1827
01:56:46,661 --> 01:56:50,140
So he's got a guy coming in to take over.
They're getting relieved

1828
01:56:52,150 --> 01:56:54,940
and the guy says, you know, hey, what's
up? Where's your battalion staff?

1829
01:56:55,330 --> 01:56:59,080
Back to the book, John's
explained, and as he did,

1830
01:56:59,830 --> 01:57:01,060
he reviewed in his mind.

1831
01:57:01,061 --> 01:57:05,220
All that had happened in the short 30
days since the first attack and the boy to

1832
01:57:05,350 --> 01:57:09,820
tail
his whole forward staff was gone.

1833
01:57:11,080 --> 01:57:12,790
Newcomb Sadler,

1834
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:17,740
Carter and McCarthy dead
Weddle and Hoffman wounded,

1835
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:23,230
grim sell out commanding
a company, nab, Ryan,

1836
01:57:23,410 --> 01:57:27,430
Todd, stolen cardiac, Kenny and Dedman,

1837
01:57:27,490 --> 01:57:31,250
all wounded besides God knew
how many other officers he,

1838
01:57:31,300 --> 01:57:33,130
he had never even known by name.

1839
01:57:34,450 --> 01:57:39,450
The company commanders from four companies
killed or wounded mostly in the space

1840
01:57:39,971 --> 01:57:42,400
of seven short action packed days.

1841
01:57:43,990 --> 01:57:48,670
He stopped talking while he thought
for a moment of all those fine people.

1842
01:57:49,780 --> 01:57:53,440
When he glanced up catching himself,
he thought he was looking at a ghost.

1843
01:57:54,280 --> 01:57:57,050
There stood Kenny the shadow on his face,

1844
01:57:57,060 --> 01:57:59,980
wavering as the candle flickered
and the faint breeze of his entry.

1845
01:57:59,981 --> 01:58:03,340
So Kenny had been wounded and
now he's back in an instant,

1846
01:58:03,341 --> 01:58:05,480
has troubles his
preoccupation with the route,

1847
01:58:05,710 --> 01:58:08,890
with the relieving officers
were forgotten. Kenny, he cried.

1848
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:13,750
When in God's name are you doing here?
Well Major. I heard you got into town.

1849
01:58:13,751 --> 01:58:16,930
All right, but we're still sort
of shorter company commanders.

1850
01:58:17,410 --> 01:58:20,440
I saw Todd deadman and cardiac back there,

1851
01:58:20,530 --> 01:58:23,290
so I thought I'd better get on up
here and see if I could do anything.

1852
01:58:23,980 --> 01:58:28,980
The docs will let you go these days if
you can stand up straight for two minutes

1853
01:58:29,021 --> 01:58:30,100
without falling down.

1854
01:58:31,450 --> 01:58:34,720
The major saw that Kenny was exhausted
in spite of his cheerful attitude.

1855
01:58:35,500 --> 01:58:39,580
He found out later that he had walked
alone in the dark all the way from the

1856
01:58:39,581 --> 01:58:40,930
division clearing station,

1857
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:44,230
several miles to the rear in order
to get back to the battalion,

1858
01:58:45,730 --> 01:58:50,650
his legs and back or covered with
bandages under his new shirt and pants.

1859
01:58:52,090 --> 01:58:55,600
You said, well old man, there isn't
anything you can do right now.

1860
01:58:56,440 --> 01:58:58,180
These nice people who've just come in,

1861
01:58:58,390 --> 01:59:02,410
so we're going to be out of this rat
trap and a little while and you just go

1862
01:59:02,411 --> 01:59:06,880
back behind Mrs Bland Shit here
and lie down and get some rest.

1863
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:10,660
You need it. Can. He did as he was told,

1864
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:15,940
the strain had begun to bend,
even his indomitable will

1865
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:20,330
at

1866
01:59:20,330 --> 01:59:25,330
zero four 40 the major
reported to regiment that
the hundred and 34th infantry

1867
01:59:27,830 --> 01:59:31,370
had taken over.
The wireman took out the phone,

1868
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:36,020
the major shook hands and said goodbye
and good luck to the new arrivals.

1869
01:59:37,070 --> 01:59:42,070
Then he and Kenny followed the companies
down the hill just seven days ago.

1870
01:59:43,370 --> 01:59:48,370
They had numbered 800 they
were now only 450 proud,

1871
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:50,300
tired men.

1872
01:59:51,290 --> 01:59:55,730
The clay pigeons who had
taken the core objective

1873
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:06,250
clay pigeons

1874
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:10,030
and from

1875
02:00:12,490 --> 02:00:16,360
Omaha beach
to the Elb,

1876
02:00:18,010 --> 02:00:19,060
the first battalion,

1877
02:00:19,061 --> 02:00:24,061
hundred and 15th Infantry 29th
Division had 2,384 casualties,

1878
02:00:29,140 --> 02:00:32,350
including 454 men killed in action.

1879
02:00:35,510 --> 02:00:40,510
That that, that's, that's
hard to even fathom. Again,

1880
02:00:40,511 --> 02:00:44,530
think about the fact that at
this time a battalion was about,

1881
02:00:44,650 --> 02:00:49,650
it's supposed to be about 900 men
and they'd taken 2,384 casualties.

1882
02:00:51,940 --> 02:00:54,580
So all the replacements that
came and kept getting wounded.

1883
02:00:54,640 --> 02:00:55,473
Yeah.

1884
02:00:57,230 --> 02:01:02,220
Unbelievable. And what's, I mean, you,

1885
02:01:02,240 --> 02:01:07,110
you got to read this book and
get the lessons learned in,

1886
02:01:07,220 --> 02:01:11,150
in also you get lessons
learned from that book. But

1887
02:01:12,680 --> 02:01:17,270
you can also get some of major
John's lesson learned from

1888
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:23,800
Colonel David Hackworth in his book about
face and what's you want to talk about

1889
02:01:25,131 --> 02:01:29,750
some layers, some, some
historical layers. Check this out.

1890
02:01:29,751 --> 02:01:33,770
So in about face,
you know,

1891
02:01:33,860 --> 02:01:38,860
Hackworth talks about what
happens in August 13th,

1892
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:39,793
1960

1893
02:01:41,270 --> 02:01:46,040
the communist in Berlin started stringing
barbed wire and they were now going to

1894
02:01:46,041 --> 02:01:48,770
build a wall between east and West Berlin.

1895
02:01:49,700 --> 02:01:52,360
And they,
you know,

1896
02:01:52,370 --> 02:01:56,180
Kennedy who was president wanted to do
something like you can't just, you know,

1897
02:01:56,181 --> 02:01:58,190
we need to do, we need to make
some kind of a statement here.

1898
02:01:58,191 --> 02:02:03,191
So he sent 1500 soldiers from the first
battle group of the Eighth Infantry

1899
02:02:06,351 --> 02:02:11,351
Division and they were
selected apparently by Kennedy,

1900
02:02:11,450 --> 02:02:15,830
by name. So Kennedy
said, I want these guys.

1901
02:02:15,831 --> 02:02:20,420
And the reason is because their commander
was a guy name Glover, s John's.

1902
02:02:21,650 --> 02:02:24,530
And he wanted them to go
and reinforce the British,

1903
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:27,140
French and American troops who
were on the ground in Berlin.

1904
02:02:28,370 --> 02:02:30,200
And then layers.

1905
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:36,100
Colonel John's in his position
appointed d company in his battle group,

1906
02:02:40,150 --> 02:02:44,930
he pointed d company to be the
battle groups reaction force

1907
02:02:47,470 --> 02:02:49,810
and who was the commander of d company.

1908
02:02:50,470 --> 02:02:55,470
It was a young Korean War veteran who
had come back into the army named captain

1909
02:02:59,680 --> 02:03:01,780
at the time,
David Hackworth.

1910
02:03:04,420 --> 02:03:06,820
And as I said,

1911
02:03:06,910 --> 02:03:11,910
Hackworth points to Glover Johns as his
primary source for leadership lessons

1912
02:03:12,311 --> 02:03:17,311
learned and he captured
them coming succinctly from
Glover Johnson himself eight

1913
02:03:20,861 --> 02:03:21,790
about face.

1914
02:03:22,750 --> 02:03:26,380
So let's take it back to
that book for a minute here.

1915
02:03:28,150 --> 02:03:28,983
Okay,

1916
02:03:32,100 --> 02:03:34,890
from about face all too soon,

1917
02:03:36,570 --> 02:03:40,230
Colonel John's received orders back
to Berlin as chief of intelligence.

1918
02:03:40,231 --> 02:03:43,950
So now this whole thing that they'd
gone through with sending this,

1919
02:03:43,951 --> 02:03:48,750
this forced to reinforce
the French British and in
American troops on the ground

1920
02:03:48,751 --> 02:03:52,560
in Berlin,
this is pretty much done all too soon.

1921
02:03:52,561 --> 02:03:55,890
Colonel Jones received orders back
to Berlin as chief of intelligence.

1922
02:03:56,880 --> 02:03:59,400
Most of us had known the
magic couldn't last forever,

1923
02:04:00,120 --> 02:04:04,170
but it didn't change the fact that we
were incredibly sad to see him go on 15

1924
02:04:04,171 --> 02:04:05,910
January,

1925
02:04:05,910 --> 02:04:10,110
1962 the battle group fell out smartly
for its final review before our favorite

1926
02:04:10,111 --> 02:04:13,530
soldier,
the weather was bitterly cold,

1927
02:04:14,190 --> 02:04:19,190
but no one noticed we were all too busy
standing tall and greedily soaking in

1928
02:04:19,711 --> 02:04:21,570
the colonel's farewell address.

1929
02:04:23,070 --> 02:04:25,470
John's was a leader who taught by example.

1930
02:04:25,530 --> 02:04:28,230
So most of the points he made
weren't exactly new to us.

1931
02:04:29,190 --> 02:04:31,590
But to hear it in a single speech,

1932
02:04:31,710 --> 02:04:36,710
this great man's basic philosophy of
soldiering was like being led down,

1933
02:04:37,290 --> 02:04:42,000
letting in on the secret
ingredients of some magical formula

1934
02:04:43,650 --> 02:04:48,390
to wit strive to do small things well,

1935
02:04:50,730 --> 02:04:51,160
okay,

1936
02:04:51,160 --> 02:04:53,800
be a doer and a self starter.

1937
02:04:54,430 --> 02:04:59,260
Aggressiveness and initiative are two
most admired qualities in a leader.

1938
02:05:00,160 --> 02:05:05,160
But you also must put your feet up and
think so there's a little dichotomy he's

1939
02:05:06,461 --> 02:05:08,620
hitting on. Yeah, you gotta be
aggressive, but you've got to think.

1940
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:15,840
Strive for self improvement
through constant self evaluation.

1941
02:05:16,940 --> 02:05:17,950
Got To be humble,

1942
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:24,990
never be satisfied.
Ask of any project.

1943
02:05:25,020 --> 02:05:26,190
How can it be done better?

1944
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:32,610
Don't over inspect or over supervise.

1945
02:05:32,850 --> 02:05:36,300
Allow your leaders to make mistakes and
training so they can profit from the

1946
02:05:36,301 --> 02:05:40,470
errors and not make them in combat.
Decentralized Command.

1947
02:05:43,230 --> 02:05:47,970
Keep the troops informed,
telling them what, how and why.

1948
02:05:48,030 --> 02:05:49,230
Builds their confidence.

1949
02:05:52,120 --> 02:05:52,953
Yeah.

1950
02:05:53,180 --> 02:05:57,680
The harder the training, the
more the troops will brag. Boom.

1951
02:05:57,770 --> 02:06:01,470
Remember that guy that asked the last
podcast, how do I improve the morale of a,

1952
02:06:01,471 --> 02:06:05,690
of a group? Get them, get them
to have that pride. Train hard.

1953
02:06:07,880 --> 02:06:12,830
Next enthusiasm,
fairness and moral and physical courage.

1954
02:06:12,980 --> 02:06:15,980
Four of the most important
aspects of leadership,

1955
02:06:18,940 --> 02:06:22,270
enthusiasm,
fairness and moral and physical courage.

1956
02:06:23,740 --> 02:06:28,240
Next, showmanship of vital
technique of leadership.

1957
02:06:28,450 --> 02:06:29,380
That's interesting.

1958
02:06:30,100 --> 02:06:34,300
And there's a bunch of
an about face Hackworth.

1959
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:39,370
He, he specifies some of these
things that he would, that,

1960
02:06:39,610 --> 02:06:43,390
that uh,
Glover Johns would do showmanship wise.

1961
02:06:43,420 --> 02:06:47,020
He'd walk down the range and he was
a really good shot with a rifle.

1962
02:06:47,740 --> 02:06:50,200
And apparently he would
have a guy throw a quarter,

1963
02:06:51,010 --> 02:06:55,660
like a coin up in the air and he'd shoot
it because he was such a good shot.

1964
02:06:56,270 --> 02:06:58,150
That. And another thing he did, he's,

1965
02:06:58,180 --> 02:07:03,180
he's about to give a speech somewhere
and in sort of a mixed audience,

1966
02:07:04,090 --> 02:07:08,560
but bunch of German, um,
sort of political people.

1967
02:07:09,310 --> 02:07:11,980
Glover, John's gets up and just
gives the speech in German.

1968
02:07:15,640 --> 02:07:20,380
All right. Next, the
ability to speak and write,

1969
02:07:20,381 --> 02:07:24,370
well,
two essential tools of leadership.

1970
02:07:25,480 --> 02:07:28,810
Boom.
Next,

1971
02:07:29,110 --> 02:07:34,110
there is a salient difference between
profanity and obscenity while the leader

1972
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:40,450
profanity tempered with discretion.
He never uses obscenities.

1973
02:07:44,060 --> 02:07:47,570
Next, have consideration for others. Hmm.

1974
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:52,040
Next,
yelling detracts from your dignity.

1975
02:07:52,850 --> 02:07:56,900
Take your medicine side and counsel them.
Next,

1976
02:07:57,740 --> 02:07:59,690
understand and use judgment.

1977
02:08:00,520 --> 02:08:04,010
Know when to stop fighting for
something you believe is right.

1978
02:08:04,790 --> 02:08:08,780
Discuss and argue your point of view
until a decision is made and then the

1979
02:08:08,781 --> 02:08:11,150
support,
the decision wholeheartedly.

1980
02:08:14,470 --> 02:08:16,900
Last,
stay ahead of your boss.

1981
02:08:17,390 --> 02:08:18,223
Okay.

1982
02:08:19,870 --> 02:08:24,760
When John's had finished colonel couch
gave the order to pass and review and

1983
02:08:24,761 --> 02:08:29,080
company by company, we marched by
with just that little extra precision.

1984
02:08:29,710 --> 02:08:30,543
Our shoes,

1985
02:08:30,580 --> 02:08:35,580
uniforms and brass earlier attended
to to provide just that little extra

1986
02:08:35,681 --> 02:08:36,514
sparkle.

1987
02:08:38,050 --> 02:08:41,710
As was the custom the company commanders
peeled off after their units passed in

1988
02:08:41,711 --> 02:08:45,520
the review stand and
congregated for final goodbye.

1989
02:08:47,480 --> 02:08:51,200
John's had watched the parade
with tears in his eyes.

1990
02:08:52,340 --> 02:08:56,630
The tears remained as
he stood at attention.

1991
02:09:01,190 --> 02:09:02,023
Okay,

1992
02:09:05,260 --> 02:09:09,340
so
tears in his eyes.

1993
02:09:10,660 --> 02:09:13,990
That is major Glover,
John's,

1994
02:09:14,020 --> 02:09:18,970
that is the clay pigeons.
That is the first battalion,

1995
02:09:18,971 --> 02:09:21,190
hundred and 15th Infantry,
29th division.

1996
02:09:21,610 --> 02:09:26,610
And obviously he is an
example of leadership

1997
02:09:31,350 --> 02:09:35,880
and the men of his battalion,

1998
02:09:37,080 --> 02:09:37,980
the clay pigeons,

1999
02:09:38,010 --> 02:09:43,010
they are yet a nother
example of the indomitable

2000
02:09:46,690 --> 02:09:51,690
warrior spirit and culture that
is the very core of this nation.

2001
02:09:59,190 --> 02:10:00,240
Don't forget that.

2002
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:03,480
Okay?

2003
02:10:03,480 --> 02:10:07,140
Don't forget that culture.

2004
02:10:08,310 --> 02:10:11,880
Don't ever forget it.
And for those of you

2005
02:10:14,770 --> 02:10:17,350
out there right now defending our nation,

2006
02:10:18,670 --> 02:10:22,930
that spirit and that culture,

2007
02:10:25,240 --> 02:10:29,800
it can work to hold you up

2008
02:10:31,940 --> 02:10:33,590
and having it in your brain

2009
02:10:36,910 --> 02:10:40,390
can keep you strong in trying times.

2010
02:10:40,391 --> 02:10:45,391
But there's also a dichotomy there because
not only does that warrior spirit and

2011
02:10:48,011 --> 02:10:52,900
warrior culture hold you up,
you also have to hold it up.

2012
02:10:57,270 --> 02:11:02,270
You have to maintain that warrior culture

2013
02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:06,960
in the way you think

2014
02:11:09,460 --> 02:11:10,780
and then the way you act.

2015
02:11:14,810 --> 02:11:19,810
And if you ever start to forget how your
spokes to think and how you're supposed

2016
02:11:19,981 --> 02:11:20,814
to act,

2017
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:27,130
then remember Colonel Glover Johns

2018
02:11:29,160 --> 02:11:33,090
and the clay pigeons
of St Lo.

2019
02:11:40,290 --> 02:11:41,123
Yeah.

2020
02:11:42,350 --> 02:11:46,430
And I think that's all I've
got for tonight. Echo Charles.

2021
02:11:47,030 --> 02:11:49,010
Yes.
So

2022
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:54,530
I guess speaking of

2023
02:11:57,140 --> 02:11:59,900
maintaining,
yes.

2024
02:12:00,980 --> 02:12:05,150
Maybe you could tell us how
we could maintain support

2025
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:10,040
of this podcast if you,
if you want, if they want.

2026
02:12:10,820 --> 02:12:14,030
And for ourselves.
Hey,

2027
02:12:14,210 --> 02:12:17,930
what is fire for effect? Oh
yeah, fire surely since. Awesome.

2028
02:12:18,260 --> 02:12:22,460
So you're on a radio and you're watching,

2029
02:12:22,490 --> 02:12:27,490
you're calling artillery or you're calling
a naval gunfire or you're calling air

2030
02:12:27,951 --> 02:12:31,550
support and you're trying to
get them to hit this target,

2031
02:12:31,580 --> 02:12:32,401
whatever that target might be.

2032
02:12:32,401 --> 02:12:36,000
And it started trying to get him to hit
a building where there's Moose. Sure.

2033
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:37,700
And they get a direct hit.

2034
02:12:39,260 --> 02:12:41,660
Now you say fire for effect.
Yeah.

2035
02:12:41,690 --> 02:12:43,220
That means you need to
make any more adjustments.

2036
02:12:43,221 --> 02:12:47,000
You can just start hammering
that thing. Boom, boom, boom,
boom. Fire for effect. God.

2037
02:12:47,090 --> 02:12:49,990
So when somebody does something and it's
on target, you like, yeah, fire for it.

2038
02:12:50,840 --> 02:12:54,890
Oh Dang. Okay. I just want it is
one of those ones that you know, I,

2039
02:12:55,160 --> 02:12:57,600
I'd hear all you in life
always say it and you know,

2040
02:12:57,601 --> 02:13:00,830
how certain do we save that
much? No, not that much. But I,

2041
02:13:00,970 --> 02:13:03,680
that's where I would
hear him kind of come out

2042
02:13:05,240 --> 02:13:06,710
and you know how certain terms,

2043
02:13:06,860 --> 02:13:09,330
if you're not familiar with them you
can kind of gather what it means is,

2044
02:13:09,331 --> 02:13:09,890
you know,
in,

2045
02:13:09,890 --> 02:13:12,320
in a contact in the conference room
in the words and stuff like that.

2046
02:13:12,321 --> 02:13:16,730
But that one I never could really figure
out exactly what that means as opposed

2047
02:13:16,731 --> 02:13:17,480
to,
you know,

2048
02:13:17,480 --> 02:13:22,010
I don't know fire at will or all these
other things that you hear fire for

2049
02:13:22,011 --> 02:13:23,450
effect far perfect cause it,

2050
02:13:23,810 --> 02:13:27,650
it kind of sounds like it could mean like
to distract them or something to have

2051
02:13:27,651 --> 02:13:31,100
some effect other than hitting the
target and something like that. Yeah,

2052
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:32,033
apparently not.

2053
02:13:32,700 --> 02:13:37,570
Apparently it's the opposite and you
know, it's all good. It's just amazing.

2054
02:13:37,610 --> 02:13:41,820
Can you show him up with these
these guys man? Yeah. And,

2055
02:13:41,910 --> 02:13:45,720
and I'm telling you like,
and I've said this before,

2056
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:47,520
that thread of,

2057
02:13:47,710 --> 02:13:52,710
and I actually don't like
using the word warrior culture.

2058
02:13:52,770 --> 02:13:56,620
Yeah. Because, because it's so overused.

2059
02:13:57,540 --> 02:14:00,150
It's so overused and it, it's just, it's,

2060
02:14:00,220 --> 02:14:04,680
it's been so degraded by this horrible,

2061
02:14:04,710 --> 02:14:09,480
meaningless things. That guy's a warrior.
You know what I mean? Because he,

2062
02:14:09,750 --> 02:14:14,600
you know, did what made it a crime and
actually survived his prison. Yeah. Well,

2063
02:14:14,610 --> 02:14:19,380
that guy's real warrior. No,
actually you're not, you know, but,

2064
02:14:19,710 --> 02:14:22,500
but there's no other word
that I can put on it.

2065
02:14:22,520 --> 02:14:24,240
I at least that I could
think of right now.

2066
02:14:24,930 --> 02:14:28,650
When you talk about the American culture,

2067
02:14:29,640 --> 02:14:33,480
and it's so easy because America's a big
place and America's got a lot of good

2068
02:14:33,481 --> 02:14:37,830
things going for it. You
know, the culture of art,

2069
02:14:38,130 --> 02:14:43,110
of art in America's massive,
the culture of music is,

2070
02:14:43,260 --> 02:14:46,590
is unbelievably powerful here.
The culture of

2071
02:14:48,090 --> 02:14:52,680
education and academia,
all these things are massive in America,

2072
02:14:52,950 --> 02:14:53,550
right?
And,

2073
02:14:53,550 --> 02:14:58,550
and it's really easy
to forget the culture.

2074
02:15:01,080 --> 02:15:04,260
This the most,
in my mind,

2075
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:07,590
the most powerful culture that we
have now. I could be wrong. Oh,

2076
02:15:08,070 --> 02:15:11,250
what about our [inaudible]
entrepreneurial spirit and culture, right?

2077
02:15:11,280 --> 02:15:15,630
That's huge year. Very strong.
Our capitalist culture,

2078
02:15:15,660 --> 02:15:19,290
we want to make money, we want to
grow, we want to do things right.

2079
02:15:19,320 --> 02:15:20,190
Those were all really,

2080
02:15:20,191 --> 02:15:25,020
really powerful and I
think we tend to forget.

2081
02:15:25,830 --> 02:15:28,590
We tend to forget. We want to,
we want to say that, you know,

2082
02:15:28,591 --> 02:15:32,730
the Japanese Bushido culture is this
thing. We should look up to. Guess what?

2083
02:15:33,480 --> 02:15:37,650
Guess what? That bushido
culture versus the US marines,

2084
02:15:39,020 --> 02:15:39,571
you know,

2085
02:15:39,571 --> 02:15:44,571
storming beaches in heavily defended
beaches and other guess what the American

2086
02:15:46,351 --> 02:15:50,670
warrior culture, that's, that's the
real deal. That's the real deal.

2087
02:15:50,760 --> 02:15:54,300
The Nazis. Oh, the
storm troopers. Oh yeah.

2088
02:15:54,450 --> 02:15:56,610
Those were such a warrior culture.
Guess what?

2089
02:15:58,350 --> 02:16:02,670
Compare them to these guys.
Know. No, not happening. Sorry.

2090
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:07,520
Yeah. Yeah. These, and you
hear this a lot like that.

2091
02:16:07,590 --> 02:16:11,370
There was a little part in the book
where the guy got his legs blown off or

2092
02:16:11,371 --> 02:16:15,140
something like that and he was like, I'll
be back. I'll be back. He's like, and it,

2093
02:16:15,210 --> 02:16:18,240
it really seemed like he was,
he wasn't pissed about his legs.

2094
02:16:18,241 --> 02:16:21,840
He was pissed that he's out of the game
for you guys down. I'm going, you know?

2095
02:16:23,070 --> 02:16:25,700
Yeah. I think a lot of
times, and you know,

2096
02:16:25,880 --> 02:16:29,160
America is kind of what an
example where you don't want the,

2097
02:16:29,180 --> 02:16:30,610
all things are going real good.

2098
02:16:30,700 --> 02:16:35,150
It's easy to point out the things that
are not going good, you know, like Whoa,

2099
02:16:35,320 --> 02:16:38,680
whatever the case may be. Like
when, if everything's perfect,

2100
02:16:38,770 --> 02:16:42,350
the little imperfections show
themselves more. You know,

2101
02:16:42,351 --> 02:16:45,130
how like if your life is
like everything's together,

2102
02:16:45,680 --> 02:16:49,840
where your job is good and your family's
good or whatever, but meanwhile,

2103
02:16:49,841 --> 02:16:52,390
like you're, I don't know, your front
line is going down. You're like,

2104
02:16:52,840 --> 02:16:56,070
my front lawn is going right. You
know, it's like that kind of thing. Um,

2105
02:16:56,120 --> 02:17:01,120
I think that's what we have in the u s
it's kind of like things are really good.

2106
02:17:02,380 --> 02:17:06,460
I think it's more just a
matter of percentage. I mean,

2107
02:17:06,490 --> 02:17:08,380
I think in America right now it's like,
oh,

2108
02:17:08,381 --> 02:17:11,890
1% of the population is actually
in the military. I mean,

2109
02:17:11,891 --> 02:17:14,860
all of these World War II veterans
are not many of them left.

2110
02:17:15,310 --> 02:17:19,120
Vietnam veterans are getting older.
Korean veterans, veterans are very,

2111
02:17:19,210 --> 02:17:23,860
very rare at this point. So, and what
are our movies about? The, you know,

2112
02:17:23,861 --> 02:17:26,230
instead of making movies about St low,

2113
02:17:26,231 --> 02:17:31,030
they make movies about the
aliens attacking or whatever,
you know. So we just,

2114
02:17:31,960 --> 02:17:36,340
it's pretty easy to forget that the
reason we're here and the reason we're not

2115
02:17:36,341 --> 02:17:41,341
speaking German is when the reason we're
not speaking Japanese is because of

2116
02:17:41,921 --> 02:17:46,060
this warrior culture here, which kind of,

2117
02:17:46,990 --> 02:17:48,790
it's right up there.
It's right up.

2118
02:17:48,840 --> 02:17:51,840
You show me any warrior culture
that has the same that, you know,

2119
02:17:51,880 --> 02:17:53,800
I know there's equivalents,
I know that there's other,

2120
02:17:54,220 --> 02:17:57,010
I know there's other military units in
the world and other countries that have a

2121
02:17:57,011 --> 02:18:01,960
proud military tradition as well. But you
know, obviously I'm biased towards mine.

2122
02:18:02,570 --> 02:18:03,520
Yeah. But, uh,

2123
02:18:03,730 --> 02:18:08,680
were you tell me any historical
unit that you say, Oh,

2124
02:18:08,690 --> 02:18:12,190
these guys with the Spartans and they
were the real warriors. Right. You know,

2125
02:18:12,220 --> 02:18:17,110
you haven't really spent much time
with a 19 year old marine. You,

2126
02:18:17,111 --> 02:18:20,220
you haven't spent much
time with a, with a, with,

2127
02:18:20,221 --> 02:18:23,650
with a soldier from an airborne
division. You just, you just,

2128
02:18:23,830 --> 02:18:27,970
you got to meet those guys. Yeah. I'm
telling you. They're the real deal.

2129
02:18:28,680 --> 02:18:31,720
Yeah. And no matter
what kind of, you know,

2130
02:18:32,170 --> 02:18:36,340
historical warrior you want to,
you want to throw out there,

2131
02:18:36,490 --> 02:18:41,490
I'll put my Americans against
the head to head it just,

2132
02:18:41,531 --> 02:18:46,120
it terms of just straight up
warrior culture and spirit.

2133
02:18:46,900 --> 02:18:50,680
I'll go, I'll go toe to tell, I'll
go toe to toe for sure. I'm not,

2134
02:18:50,740 --> 02:18:54,280
I'm not trying to say we're better,
but I'll go toe to toe with the Spartans.

2135
02:18:54,480 --> 02:18:57,640
Yeah. I'll go toe to toe with
them. I am just talking, you know,

2136
02:18:58,180 --> 02:19:01,900
my warrior culture against your warrior
culture and the way you lived your life,

2137
02:19:01,940 --> 02:19:04,960
you go, go meet some of these young
soldiers and marines out there.

2138
02:19:06,610 --> 02:19:08,950
You can come and talk to me and,
and special operations guys.

2139
02:19:08,980 --> 02:19:12,010
You know what I mean?
Obviously come and get some,

2140
02:19:17,110 --> 02:19:21,820
come in fire for effect. Sorry,
do it. I just learned the word.

2141
02:19:21,821 --> 02:19:25,270
I'm trying to hit it in warrior culture
doesn't get through all of America.

2142
02:19:28,970 --> 02:19:33,470
Nonetheless.
We are down to support ourselves.

2143
02:19:33,530 --> 02:19:37,400
I wasn't gonna make some wisecrack about
Hawaii, but you know. Yeah, you might,

2144
02:19:37,430 --> 02:19:40,320
you might get dealt with.
No, not going to do that. No,

2145
02:19:40,430 --> 02:19:44,300
because just a massive,
there's a,

2146
02:19:44,301 --> 02:19:49,301
there's a great book that somebody sent
me and it's about Japanese Americans

2147
02:19:50,690 --> 02:19:54,210
that formed up, you
know, we sent American,

2148
02:19:54,211 --> 02:19:58,820
sent many Japanese to internment
camps in America, in World War II.

2149
02:19:58,940 --> 02:20:01,910
They also took a bunch of them and
turned them into a fighting unit.

2150
02:20:02,210 --> 02:20:05,210
But the four 47 yes.
And they were,

2151
02:20:05,720 --> 02:20:09,950
they might be the most highly
decorated unit of their,

2152
02:20:10,370 --> 02:20:14,120
of that size because B,

2153
02:20:14,460 --> 02:20:16,680
but a lot of them came
from why? Yeah, yeah.

2154
02:20:16,790 --> 02:20:20,960
It's a huge Japanese community in
Hawaii. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah.

2155
02:20:21,020 --> 02:20:25,190
And speaking of Hawaiian [inaudible] hall,
like the and Warrior culture,

2156
02:20:25,250 --> 02:20:27,350
Hawaii for sure.
Yeah.

2157
02:20:27,380 --> 02:20:32,380
So am I allowed to just straight up
say Bj tender right now and my boy Max

2158
02:20:32,720 --> 02:20:37,670
Holloway, by the way, by the way, car
Max came and trained with us. Yeah.

2159
02:20:37,671 --> 02:20:41,450
I've told this story before, but man,
what a board, a beast. He, you know what?

2160
02:20:41,451 --> 02:20:44,910
He was trained in hard.
Yeah. He was trained hard.

2161
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:47,480
He wasn't even close to the UFC yet.
This was years ago.

2162
02:20:47,660 --> 02:20:50,940
It wasn't close to the UFC yet. He hit
some warrior culture and them, yeah,

2163
02:20:51,080 --> 02:20:53,120
get some super nice guy too.
And when you,

2164
02:20:53,121 --> 02:20:56,510
when you can sit her like
even let's say the sparked in,

2165
02:20:56,520 --> 02:20:58,100
then you consider all
their battles and stuff.

2166
02:20:58,101 --> 02:21:02,860
This is like hand to hand soared to
nec battles. Just like Dang that's,

2167
02:21:02,930 --> 02:21:03,763
that's savage.

2168
02:21:03,890 --> 02:21:08,210
But back in those days look
at all kinds of cultures.

2169
02:21:08,211 --> 02:21:09,560
So consider Hawaiian culture.

2170
02:21:09,561 --> 02:21:12,760
If you look at the weapons like you can
look like in museum, just go online,

2171
02:21:12,770 --> 02:21:13,011
whatever,

2172
02:21:13,011 --> 02:21:16,790
look at the weapons that they used in
battle and then consider like that's what

2173
02:21:16,791 --> 02:21:21,130
you got to use. It's like
savage, like Plu. Yeah there,

2174
02:21:21,140 --> 02:21:25,790
there are legitimate where your
cultures but it is different.

2175
02:21:25,940 --> 02:21:29,890
There's no doubt.
And what I'm saying to,

2176
02:21:29,960 --> 02:21:34,880
to encapsulate what I'm saying is America
has one and it's told her toe with

2177
02:21:34,881 --> 02:21:39,680
any, I don't slip and sleep on that. So

2178
02:21:41,480 --> 02:21:46,430
support, support wise. I'm going
to shift gears here. So, I mean,

2179
02:21:46,450 --> 02:21:48,740
you know, I, I'm talking
about kettle bells all to,

2180
02:21:48,741 --> 02:21:52,760
I feel like I'm talking about not just
now feel like I talk about kettle bells a

2181
02:21:52,761 --> 02:21:54,620
lot.
It's one of those things,

2182
02:21:54,621 --> 02:21:57,110
you know how like you go from
thing to thing and you're like,

2183
02:21:57,111 --> 02:22:01,730
Hey I'm going to go to one.
You go from thing to thing.

2184
02:22:02,300 --> 02:22:06,770
You know, I try to acquire knowledge
and what do you call it? Skills.

2185
02:22:06,830 --> 02:22:11,780
Capabilities. We'll say
capabilities that's important.
Participation is required.

2186
02:22:12,150 --> 02:22:17,060
Kettlebells is kind of like a thing that
I recently got into and I'm going to be

2187
02:22:17,061 --> 02:22:19,940
honest with you.
You can kind of good at them Jack.

2188
02:22:20,680 --> 02:22:24,140
Cause considerK and here's, I'm
going to go into numbers, whatever.

2189
02:22:24,200 --> 02:22:29,040
So my metcon was,
his wit was um,

2190
02:22:29,310 --> 02:22:33,240
I'll do one 35 can I knew jerk cleaning,

2191
02:22:33,241 --> 02:22:35,330
press dreck,
whatever presses.

2192
02:22:35,340 --> 02:22:39,180
Like just pressing night jerk is kind
of like you jerk your whole body kind of

2193
02:22:39,181 --> 02:22:44,100
thing. Okay. So it's
clean and jerk one 35,

2194
02:22:44,101 --> 02:22:47,760
you know the wheels, uh,
five and then two burpees,

2195
02:22:47,761 --> 02:22:52,530
five walked for 30 to 35
seconds. Boom. Do it again.

2196
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:55,570
So anywhere from,
I dunno

2197
02:22:57,280 --> 02:23:00,840
to about eight sets would
be like a solid one.

2198
02:23:00,841 --> 02:23:05,580
Usually 32nd walk. By the way,
it's like, uh, the recovery.

2199
02:23:06,210 --> 02:23:09,380
It's like, it's like you're breathing.
That's why. Okay, so it helps. Wait.

2200
02:23:09,390 --> 02:23:13,390
Why should I not do that? I'll be going
to five, five, five, five you wouldn't,

2201
02:23:13,500 --> 02:23:14,790
I challenge you right now.

2202
02:23:14,791 --> 02:23:17,880
We're going to do it together and you
just go five five oaks. We can go longer.

2203
02:23:17,940 --> 02:23:22,080
Well, I don't want to do that.
Well, I might die. Contest
wouldn't be to go longer.

2204
02:23:22,830 --> 02:23:27,720
Well, whoever, whoever stops the
rhythm. I'm saying that the rest is,

2205
02:23:27,790 --> 02:23:32,100
it's part Rico here. Here's the goal.
That's why. Well, let me ask you this.

2206
02:23:32,400 --> 02:23:34,500
How long does it take you?
Like 30 seconds to do.

2207
02:23:34,740 --> 02:23:37,930
Does it take 30 seconds to do the five
and five? Yeah. No, no, no more. None. No,

2208
02:23:37,931 --> 02:23:42,810
no more than 30 so you do five clean
and press right. Boom. Five burpees.

2209
02:23:42,840 --> 02:23:47,490
Yeah, it's more than 30 seconds.
Maybe 45 at the most, maybe 45 yet.

2210
02:23:47,730 --> 02:23:50,460
I Dunno. That's a good question. And
it's more than 30 though, for sure. Okay.

2211
02:23:50,461 --> 02:23:53,160
Well then I guess it might be all right.
So put that on a timer though.

2212
02:23:53,161 --> 02:23:57,000
You shouldn't do sand like a minute 30
IBS for 30 to 35 you should be like, okay,

2213
02:23:57,030 --> 02:24:01,080
I'm doing it all because you're saying
like the Tba, well you should do,

2214
02:24:01,110 --> 02:24:02,550
you should do a minute,

2215
02:24:02,551 --> 02:24:07,230
30 seconds every no and every minute and
30 seconds. So you do the five and five.

2216
02:24:07,260 --> 02:24:09,780
Okay. So that way you get, cause by the,

2217
02:24:09,870 --> 02:24:12,300
by the six set you'll be like
tired when you're starting it,

2218
02:24:12,780 --> 02:24:16,260
but you don't want to rest more push
yourself. This is kind of my thought,

2219
02:24:16,320 --> 02:24:21,120
my thought process on it is I'm going
to do a certain kind of work capacity,

2220
02:24:21,500 --> 02:24:22,333
you know like you know,

2221
02:24:22,380 --> 02:24:25,780
five reps of this and five reps of
this and then I'm going to have,

2222
02:24:25,910 --> 02:24:29,540
have a kind of an active
recovery period walking. Yeah.

2223
02:24:29,880 --> 02:24:34,020
And here's the thing and here's kind
of the goal. This is good. I actually,

2224
02:24:34,021 --> 02:24:35,580
I actually am going back on what I said.

2225
02:24:35,581 --> 02:24:38,640
I think this is actually not a bad
idea because, but you need to put,

2226
02:24:38,810 --> 02:24:41,280
it's like when I do,
sometimes I'll do stuff on the minute.

2227
02:24:41,820 --> 02:24:44,970
What makes me nervous about what you're
saying is that I like rest for about 30

2228
02:24:44,971 --> 02:24:47,700
and 35 seconds. No, I don't know
what that means. Okay, okay. Because,

2229
02:24:47,790 --> 02:24:51,180
because that could be 40 seconds.
That could also be, it's not,

2230
02:24:51,560 --> 02:24:55,830
you've got a clock on. Yes sir. That's
100% yes. So the, here's the weird thing,

2231
02:24:55,860 --> 02:25:00,860
but having a clock ever since I started
lifting rest between sets has been a

2232
02:25:01,261 --> 02:25:05,460
critical part of my lifting routine
from the beginning. Rest between,

2233
02:25:05,700 --> 02:25:07,530
because that's just what I
learned and stuff like that.

2234
02:25:08,400 --> 02:25:13,400
So I don't think the clock and actual
clock is not been a part of a workout

2235
02:25:15,750 --> 02:25:18,540
ever. It's part of the way.
It's like, wait, there's weight,

2236
02:25:18,930 --> 02:25:21,800
just like you're lifting those weights.
That's what the weights are for. The,

2237
02:25:21,810 --> 02:25:24,400
you're going to rest in between sets.
That's what the clock is for.

2238
02:25:24,430 --> 02:25:26,830
You can't just go willy nilly and be
like, Hey, I'll just throw on whatever,

2239
02:25:27,580 --> 02:25:28,780
and that's just my philosophy.

2240
02:25:28,781 --> 02:25:33,781
I'm not on the clock of a one hour
workout from me would take like two hours.

2241
02:25:34,150 --> 02:25:35,200
Yeah.
I'll just,

2242
02:25:35,530 --> 02:25:38,440
I'll just be thinking about something or
I'll just take more rest than I should

2243
02:25:38,441 --> 02:25:41,500
have taken or whatever. Yeah. And
consider this, if you're doing,

2244
02:25:41,501 --> 02:25:45,340
let's say you're doing five
sets of squats, I dunno, eight,

2245
02:25:45,370 --> 02:25:49,030
we'll say you're pushing
on your second set,

2246
02:25:49,150 --> 02:25:54,150
you can do more weight then or less
weight then on your first set if you rest

2247
02:25:54,341 --> 02:25:58,900
for less time there. Right. So if you rest
for five minutes, you can do way more.

2248
02:25:59,160 --> 02:25:59,560
Yeah.

2249
02:25:59,560 --> 02:26:02,450
So that's putting your body through
something different than if you would've

2250
02:26:02,470 --> 02:26:03,281
just rested less.

2251
02:26:03,281 --> 02:26:06,460
So it just depends on what you're trying
to put your body through while you can

2252
02:26:06,461 --> 02:26:08,740
recover from. And what kind of
results we want to goals on.

2253
02:26:08,890 --> 02:26:12,690
Or one of the hardest workouts is,
and this isn't,

2254
02:26:12,760 --> 02:26:15,240
this is discipline equals
freedom field manual.

2255
02:26:16,900 --> 02:26:20,410
I used to do the 20 rep squat workout.
Sure.

2256
02:26:20,890 --> 02:26:24,970
Which is you take away that you can do 10
times, you do it 20 times. Oh yeah. Okay.

2257
02:26:24,971 --> 02:26:28,580
Sorry. And, and it's, it's
devastatingly hard. Yeah.

2258
02:26:29,230 --> 02:26:34,120
And I would rest for 20 minutes and then
I would do it again and then I would

2259
02:26:34,121 --> 02:26:37,690
rest for 20 minutes and then we'll
do it again. So three sets of that.

2260
02:26:38,680 --> 02:26:43,060
That is okay.
So tech and I believe you,

2261
02:26:43,061 --> 02:26:46,960
I'm not saying it's easy, I'm not
saying that, but that being said,

2262
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:50,500
technically that's impossible.
Technically yes, you're right.

2263
02:26:50,530 --> 02:26:53,650
It is impossible to do something
that you only do 10 times, 20 times.

2264
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:57,610
If you can do the weight that
you intend for him to 20 times,

2265
02:26:57,670 --> 02:27:01,710
that's the way he can do for 20 days
straight. That's not 10 right. So I get,

2266
02:27:01,800 --> 02:27:05,500
I get it, but I'm not going to,
I'm not going to, you're right.

2267
02:27:06,400 --> 02:27:08,020
But you also understand what I'm talking.

2268
02:27:08,030 --> 02:27:10,240
I know exactly what you're talking about.
You're like a normal,

2269
02:27:10,330 --> 02:27:13,420
like you're not maxing out
at 10 reps with this weight.

2270
02:27:13,690 --> 02:27:17,410
It's like this is my normal.
Maybe if I'm going to do a set of Tanner,

2271
02:27:17,411 --> 02:27:20,380
she'll be surprised that
the way you can get,

2272
02:27:20,590 --> 02:27:23,340
like let's say you know,
you,

2273
02:27:23,370 --> 02:27:26,480
you pick the right weight that you
can like I can do this 10 times. Yeah.

2274
02:27:27,020 --> 02:27:31,120
Legitimately. And then you're like, you
know what, I'm going to do it 20 times.

2275
02:27:31,150 --> 02:27:34,100
I know, but you're right.

2276
02:27:34,360 --> 02:27:36,910
But I think that's like a curse
of knowledge kind of situation.

2277
02:27:36,911 --> 02:27:40,180
Like when you say I'm going
to do a weight 20 times,

2278
02:27:40,210 --> 02:27:44,530
what I can say for lack of better during
the normally do tan, it's not normal.

2279
02:27:44,531 --> 02:27:46,540
Also, you're like, you're basically,

2280
02:27:47,200 --> 02:27:50,230
you're resting as much as a human being
can rest with a bunch of weight on their

2281
02:27:50,231 --> 02:27:54,700
back in between Reps. When you get
to rep 12, you're taking like time.

2282
02:27:55,070 --> 02:27:56,740
But it's, it's, it's a really,

2283
02:27:56,860 --> 02:28:00,430
it's a losing proposition because
while you're waiting there resting,

2284
02:28:00,490 --> 02:28:04,720
you're actually suffering
and your backstory to get
old in there. Yeah, yeah. No,

2285
02:28:04,750 --> 02:28:05,240
yeah.

2286
02:28:05,240 --> 02:28:09,070
The overhead squats are a brutal because
you're not resting in an overhead squat

2287
02:28:09,071 --> 02:28:13,300
position and it's like awkward
and yeah, that, that's hard.

2288
02:28:13,540 --> 02:28:16,810
The overhead squat situation, but,
and not to beat a dead horse here,

2289
02:28:16,870 --> 02:28:20,710
so like consider if you said,
hey, uh, someone who's pretty new,

2290
02:28:20,711 --> 02:28:21,950
more or less to work it out. Say, Hey,

2291
02:28:21,951 --> 02:28:26,000
get a weight you can do for 10 and do it
20 they're going to mess up in one way

2292
02:28:26,090 --> 02:28:29,450
ticket. Probably they're going to be
like, okay, I can do this 10 times.

2293
02:28:29,451 --> 02:28:33,260
I know that and I'm gonna try to do 20
and they can't even get to get 20 because

2294
02:28:33,261 --> 02:28:36,500
you said the weight that they could do
for 10 they try for 20 they feel it 10

2295
02:28:36,740 --> 02:28:39,830
that's how much they can
do for 10 or they'll go the
other way. There'll be like,

2296
02:28:39,920 --> 02:28:43,330
you were like, oh, get up. And they'll be
like, wait, I got to do this 20 times. I,

2297
02:28:43,500 --> 02:28:46,160
yeah, I can do this. I
can do the bar 10 times,

2298
02:28:46,430 --> 02:28:50,560
so I'll just use the bar kind of thing.
So you have that knowledge where you,

2299
02:28:50,561 --> 02:28:54,200
you're like, Hey, I know the weight
that I can do for 10 and it'll be hard,

2300
02:28:54,410 --> 02:28:57,080
but you know what, I'm going to get
nuts. And if I really pushed myself,

2301
02:28:57,081 --> 02:28:59,330
I can get 20 guess what I'm using.
Not Wait.

2302
02:28:59,331 --> 02:29:03,400
So you kind of have that because you've
been training, so I get it. Yeah,

2303
02:29:03,410 --> 02:29:04,243
you're right.

2304
02:29:05,030 --> 02:29:08,000
And I don't think I'll ever do that
even though I kind of considered it last

2305
02:29:08,001 --> 02:29:11,540
time you mentioned it, but then when I got
in the, in the workout room I was like,

2306
02:29:11,870 --> 02:29:15,290
yeah, I don't think I'll ever do
that. Maybe I will. I don't know.

2307
02:29:15,340 --> 02:29:18,800
You were actually, I'll tell you
what I will do. Is someone online,

2308
02:29:18,801 --> 02:29:22,810
maybe it was you. Someone was saying a
hundred burpees in 10 minutes. 10 minutes.

2309
02:29:22,830 --> 02:29:26,530
Was that you saying? Yeah.
Yeah. And Brent. Brendan just
texted me yesterday. Yeah.

2310
02:29:26,600 --> 02:29:29,060
Brianna branch. Cherry. Yeah.
He said he's going to do it.

2311
02:29:29,450 --> 02:29:32,280
I was considering I'm going to
do it in the first time I did it.

2312
02:29:32,650 --> 02:29:34,280
That's what I saw was
surprised at Brandon.

2313
02:29:34,281 --> 02:29:36,200
Brandon's a good shape to the receipt.

2314
02:29:36,201 --> 02:29:39,890
He be post like pictures of himself
doing these crazy pushup workouts. Yeah.

2315
02:29:39,950 --> 02:29:42,290
I can't believe he can't do it.
That's why I'm so surprised.

2316
02:29:42,590 --> 02:29:47,000
This is what I'll do is a weird,
he has good creative pushup drills.

2317
02:29:47,030 --> 02:29:51,170
Does creative pushup drills, I don't
know. He'd doing this weird stuff.

2318
02:29:51,190 --> 02:29:55,340
He puts his hands up here.
Over there. Yeah. That's good.
Yeah. Totally good. Yeah.

2319
02:29:55,341 --> 02:29:58,070
Cause you ever trade lake. I got
good at push ups when I was thinking,

2320
02:29:58,071 --> 02:29:59,900
actually I'm still pretty
solid that pushups.

2321
02:30:00,140 --> 02:30:04,580
But you tried to do a pushup with like
adjusted. You're like, oh this is way off.

2322
02:30:04,760 --> 02:30:06,050
It's kind of like goes back
to what we were saying.

2323
02:30:06,051 --> 02:30:08,540
It's like what you used
to do your neuro muscular.

2324
02:30:08,590 --> 02:30:12,830
Speaking of what we were saying
something about kettlebells,

2325
02:30:14,820 --> 02:30:18,080
we kind of wrap up right now and
then you started talking about other,

2326
02:30:18,110 --> 02:30:21,770
the other crazy squat.
You don't what it is my fault

2327
02:30:23,990 --> 02:30:26,960
next time I won't tell anything. Yeah.
Yeah. See that's what, that's what I see.

2328
02:30:26,961 --> 02:30:27,681
What you did there.
Look,

2329
02:30:27,681 --> 02:30:32,230
you took blame you and you told me what
you're going to do to fix it. Yeah.

2330
02:30:32,600 --> 02:30:36,250
Dang. Extreme ownership in
effect. I'm also, okay, wait,

2331
02:30:36,640 --> 02:30:39,200
what were we talking about? Oh yeah,
I'm into kettlebells. No. Yeah,

2332
02:30:39,950 --> 02:30:41,730
and you want to say where are
you should get your kettle walls.

2333
02:30:41,750 --> 02:30:44,840
I'm not saying necessarily where you
should. I'm seeing where I got them. Okay.

2334
02:30:44,890 --> 02:30:48,260
And if you want you,
you kettlebells anywhere where really?

2335
02:30:48,470 --> 02:30:50,750
What about cool kettlebells?
Ooh, okay. Whoa.

2336
02:30:50,751 --> 02:30:54,470
That's a different story in my head
anyway. I don't mind from on it.

2337
02:30:55,310 --> 02:30:57,060
I'm not even saying get
the cool kettlebells.

2338
02:30:57,080 --> 02:31:01,870
I'm seeing gold on at.com/jocko

2339
02:31:02,080 --> 02:31:04,210
Lukey the kettle bells.
You liked those kettlebells.

2340
02:31:04,240 --> 02:31:06,910
If you're going to get into kettlebells
or if you're already currently into

2341
02:31:06,911 --> 02:31:11,410
kettle bells, get some of those
if you like them. I like them.

2342
02:31:11,650 --> 02:31:16,480
I got one. Uh, the small one. It's
called a howler little howler monkey.

2343
02:31:18,190 --> 02:31:18,640
Yeah,

2344
02:31:18,640 --> 02:31:22,080
I think it's a, anyway, howler
monkey, kettle bell. It's like a,

2345
02:31:22,081 --> 02:31:23,940
I won't say 18 pounds.
What's 0.5?

2346
02:31:23,941 --> 02:31:28,290
Pooed a bounce and Prudy 16 pounds.

2347
02:31:28,950 --> 02:31:32,760
Yeah, no, no, no, no. 16 kilos I
think. Oh, sorry. 16 kilos. Yeah. Yeah.

2348
02:31:33,690 --> 02:31:37,980
So yeah, so eight kilos, 16
pounds, give or take. 70 18.

2349
02:31:38,790 --> 02:31:42,150
Anyway, I got one of those for my
daughter. So my nephew comes visits.

2350
02:31:42,151 --> 02:31:44,490
He's 11 not into working out.

2351
02:31:44,520 --> 02:31:48,840
We'll just say that is now is
now. Yeah. So I'm like, you know,

2352
02:31:48,841 --> 02:31:52,920
he's one of these kids, he's like,
you know, he's into math and whatnot.

2353
02:31:53,040 --> 02:31:56,910
So I'm working out all the time and I'd
never really thought until someone may

2354
02:31:56,911 --> 02:32:00,210
be kind of suggested it to say, hey
come work out with me, you know,

2355
02:32:00,890 --> 02:32:02,520
so I tell them come work out and he,

2356
02:32:02,580 --> 02:32:06,960
I kind of caught them at the end where
it was metcon time and he and I was like,

2357
02:32:06,961 --> 02:32:11,570
hey come work out. Cause I saw
him, you know, and uh, he's
like, yeah, he's like cool.

2358
02:32:11,730 --> 02:32:15,810
Immediately do by the way, you'd be
surprised. I'm not surprised. Yeah man.

2359
02:32:16,980 --> 02:32:20,880
Working out. They're like, man, I want to
be like dad. You know, in their, on some,

2360
02:32:22,170 --> 02:32:25,110
remember you saw somebody that was all
yoked. You're lucky. Do you, how do I do?

2361
02:32:25,111 --> 02:32:27,420
That's the whole reason I work
out to be honest with you.

2362
02:32:27,421 --> 02:32:29,800
Like remember the show American
gladiators. Remember that.

2363
02:32:30,270 --> 02:32:33,010
But it was not from what I was a kid.
Yeah.

2364
02:32:33,650 --> 02:32:36,600
I didn't watch it the way you were
apparently. Yeah, I was watching that.

2365
02:32:36,601 --> 02:32:39,690
I was like, Bro, I want to be an American
guy. Cause they were there. It was like,

2366
02:32:39,780 --> 02:32:43,140
cause there was the mix between these
big kind of almost like bullies,

2367
02:32:43,170 --> 02:32:45,750
not bullies, like a bully
people, but they were like,

2368
02:32:45,840 --> 02:32:48,550
you know when you play the video game
you come against the boss who you look at

2369
02:32:48,551 --> 02:32:49,920
them, you're like, I can't meet this guy.

2370
02:32:50,040 --> 02:32:52,710
I can't beat them but you and you're
a normal character or whatever.

2371
02:32:52,711 --> 02:32:55,290
And then they ended up winning and that's
what American latter years was in real

2372
02:32:55,291 --> 02:32:55,680
life.

2373
02:32:55,680 --> 02:32:59,820
And I was like Dang this
American gladiators or or
or money cause were athletic

2374
02:32:59,821 --> 02:33:03,470
too. I was like, man, I I, I'd watch
it and I do a bunch of pushups.

2375
02:33:03,480 --> 02:33:06,450
I was in like sixth grade or something
like that. Yeah, it's a whole reason.

2376
02:33:06,451 --> 02:33:08,620
Anyway, I think a lot of
kids have that in their mind,

2377
02:33:08,621 --> 02:33:11,310
especially the boys for sure in
one way or another. So I was like,

2378
02:33:11,311 --> 02:33:15,480
hey come work out with me. And he's like,
he was like, okay, let's turn this phone.

2379
02:33:15,510 --> 02:33:18,940
Yeah, he was on the phone. Not Anymore.
Boom out there. Uncle Jake scenario,

2380
02:33:19,170 --> 02:33:19,681
uncle Jake,

2381
02:33:19,681 --> 02:33:24,420
100% I was uncle Jacob that
time legit nephew is there.

2382
02:33:24,450 --> 02:33:27,840
Visit. Actually he was visiting me. I
wasn't visiting, but nonetheless he comes,

2383
02:33:27,841 --> 02:33:30,450
I teach him the form and
kids kind of have good form.

2384
02:33:30,480 --> 02:33:33,510
Well he did cause they're flexible.
Yeah, they're flexible. They,

2385
02:33:33,900 --> 02:33:36,420
they haven't fallen into
like improper patterns.

2386
02:33:36,660 --> 02:33:40,110
Maybe like make adults ever or something
maybe. I don't know. That's just a guess.

2387
02:33:40,111 --> 02:33:44,160
But anyway, so I'm like, you know,
just the basic kettlebell swing. I say,

2388
02:33:44,580 --> 02:33:47,610
this is what you're going to do. Do
it. I'll do it. I'll show you how.

2389
02:33:47,670 --> 02:33:49,380
Give them little little tips or whatever.
You know,

2390
02:33:49,440 --> 02:33:52,320
it wasn't perfect for him at first.
You'd adjust and he could do it.

2391
02:33:53,850 --> 02:33:56,880
Not the kind of all the way up or nothing.
Just so basic. I was like, all right.

2392
02:33:57,570 --> 02:34:00,240
And my daughter happened to be there
and just so she knows about burpees,

2393
02:34:00,241 --> 02:34:01,080
so I was like,
okay,

2394
02:34:01,140 --> 02:34:04,560
what we're going to do is you can do
kettle bell swings were five and then

2395
02:34:04,561 --> 02:34:07,410
you're going to do burpees and they're
going to walk for 30 seconds basically

2396
02:34:07,411 --> 02:34:08,244
matter.
Yeah.

2397
02:34:08,640 --> 02:34:10,650
But he's doing the Kettlebell swings
rather than the clean and press.

2398
02:34:10,651 --> 02:34:13,890
So then you can do burpees.
Burpees has just jumped down,

2399
02:34:13,900 --> 02:34:17,480
do a pushup and then jump up
in there. That's a burpee.
So he does it. I was like,

2400
02:34:17,500 --> 02:34:20,830
hmm. Well on the, you know when you
transitioned from standing to push up,

2401
02:34:20,890 --> 02:34:24,780
there's a loop. There's some wiggle room
there for air. So I, I tell my daughter,

2402
02:34:24,781 --> 02:34:27,970
hey, demonstrate, she does. She's four,
she can do it pretty good too by the way.

2403
02:34:28,660 --> 02:34:32,020
So she does it and I'm so of course he
can do it. He sees a little girl did.

2404
02:34:32,050 --> 02:34:34,660
So he does it, makes the adjustment.
Boom, he's good to go. He's ready.

2405
02:34:35,770 --> 02:34:38,830
So I'm being fired out cause mine's about
to be super hard like it normally is.

2406
02:34:38,860 --> 02:34:41,490
And he's like, you could tell he's
getting fired up too, you know.

2407
02:34:41,520 --> 02:34:44,890
So I set the clock and we go and his
is kind of easy to be honest with you.

2408
02:34:44,891 --> 02:34:48,880
Cause the Kettlebell swings compared
to the yeah. And Boom, they kid did,

2409
02:34:48,881 --> 02:34:51,850
did the whole thing and he's all
sweating afterwards, you know,

2410
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:55,750
and he's the kind of where he doesn't
do that kind of stuff, you know?

2411
02:34:55,780 --> 02:34:58,820
But you could tell he was super fired
up and you know what he said next.

2412
02:34:59,540 --> 02:35:02,080
He said afterwards, he's like,
hey, next time you work out,

2413
02:35:02,081 --> 02:35:06,430
can you let me know straight up. I was
like, God Dang. Uncle echoes in the house.

2414
02:35:06,431 --> 02:35:09,240
In the house. Man in the house.
Yeah, so she read a book about that.

2415
02:35:11,890 --> 02:35:13,450
Yeah.
Maybe I will.

2416
02:35:13,670 --> 02:35:17,500
It will be the best book
ever forgets next anyway,

2417
02:35:18,420 --> 02:35:20,350
kind of what's going on it.
They have a lot of good stuff.

2418
02:35:20,351 --> 02:35:24,450
You ever done the battle ropes before?
Yes. You have, but not never have.

2419
02:35:24,990 --> 02:35:27,850
They were in some random Gmr was
at the time I was gonna have,

2420
02:35:27,851 --> 02:35:30,700
I've seen people doing this. I'm going to
do some of them. Yeah. They're like big,

2421
02:35:31,120 --> 02:35:34,600
big ropes and the, I guess that's a good
exercise. I had never done them before,

2422
02:35:34,601 --> 02:35:37,240
but I was considering that.
I saw some on there anyway,

2423
02:35:37,340 --> 02:35:40,870
was a lot of good stuff on
it.com/jocko checkout, all the stuff.

2424
02:35:41,500 --> 02:35:46,000
Really good stuff. Stuff for everything.
Basically everything getting after it.

2425
02:35:46,450 --> 02:35:51,450
Also good way to support is when
you get your copy of about face.

2426
02:35:52,301 --> 02:35:54,970
Of course that's already on
it, on our website, Jocko,

2427
02:35:54,971 --> 02:35:58,450
podcast.com that's the website.
If you didn't know clay,

2428
02:35:58,540 --> 02:36:01,810
the clay pigeons of St Lo,

2429
02:36:02,110 --> 02:36:06,070
that's the current book we just went over.
That one is on the website as well.

2430
02:36:06,130 --> 02:36:09,330
It's in the little section menu item
on the top of the website, Jocko,

2431
02:36:09,331 --> 02:36:12,730
podcast.com click books from episodes,
boom,

2432
02:36:12,731 --> 02:36:14,470
the list of books by episode.

2433
02:36:14,650 --> 02:36:19,650
Click through there and before you
tweet me and tell me a good book that I

2434
02:36:20,111 --> 02:36:24,100
should do on the podcast check and
see if I've already done it. Yeah,

2435
02:36:24,150 --> 02:36:25,390
it was like what?

2436
02:36:25,420 --> 02:36:29,470
Like 60 bucks or so and a lot of
really good books that everyone knows,

2437
02:36:29,471 --> 02:36:32,890
but if you haven't listened to the podcast
and then you're telling me to cover

2438
02:36:33,370 --> 02:36:37,990
with the old breed by Eugene sledge or uh,
whatever,

2439
02:36:37,991 --> 02:36:40,780
just so a lot of times people telling
me to cover books that have already been

2440
02:36:40,781 --> 02:36:44,020
on there. Yeah. So then I got to go
and figure out which podcast it was.

2441
02:36:44,021 --> 02:36:46,300
So I can tell you to go and
listen to podcasts, you know,

2442
02:36:46,330 --> 02:36:51,100
10 which is what the old breed by Eugene
sledge. There you go. I think. Yeah,

2443
02:36:51,101 --> 02:36:54,370
something like that. But if hey, hey,
go and check that out. Like I said,

2444
02:36:54,640 --> 02:36:57,880
it's all there by episode and if you
want a boat, a reading list for me,

2445
02:36:58,300 --> 02:37:00,790
that's my reading. That's it.
Yeah. There's no other books.

2446
02:37:00,820 --> 02:37:03,060
If a book is good and I read it,
it's been,

2447
02:37:03,080 --> 02:37:07,300
it's been on the podcast and I'll do you
one better cause I have a small reading

2448
02:37:07,301 --> 02:37:11,200
list that I added to that
list. Oh, that's only one book,

2449
02:37:11,410 --> 02:37:16,140
but I'm just saying he's playing
games. Yes. Powell. Michael Lough. Um,

2450
02:37:16,200 --> 02:37:19,070
you know, that's an easy read.
It's kind of like the field manual,

2451
02:37:19,071 --> 02:37:21,740
a small little version, different
subject. But nonetheless,

2452
02:37:22,130 --> 02:37:27,080
it's not like the field manual
duty. I haven't read it, but I know.

2453
02:37:27,400 --> 02:37:31,760
No, no, probably not. Anyway,
um, it, as far as supporting,

2454
02:37:31,880 --> 02:37:35,170
get your books through their
click through, it goes to Amazon.

2455
02:37:35,190 --> 02:37:39,770
You Shop Amazon like we all do anyway.
Right. So when you get these books,

2456
02:37:40,220 --> 02:37:41,510
like I said,
listed by episode,

2457
02:37:41,511 --> 02:37:45,470
Click through there and if you're doing
other shopping, hey, feel free. You know,

2458
02:37:46,490 --> 02:37:48,980
when you click through there
that say small little action,

2459
02:37:51,020 --> 02:37:54,050
big reaction as far as support those,
you know, kind of like, you know,

2460
02:37:54,051 --> 02:37:58,990
when you thorough sodium metal and
water, you know, oh I know. Yeah.

2461
02:37:58,991 --> 02:38:00,680
No, you know, for, I haven't
said it for a long time,

2462
02:38:00,681 --> 02:38:04,160
so I'm gonna say it now just to remind
everybody when you throw sodium metal and

2463
02:38:04,161 --> 02:38:07,580
water, it explodes. Big. Huge
Ellen that in chemistry class,

2464
02:38:08,360 --> 02:38:11,360
my chemistry teacher's name
is mister Bigelow by the way.

2465
02:38:12,410 --> 02:38:16,580
Quite high school back in the day.
Anyway. Also good way to support,

2466
02:38:16,581 --> 02:38:18,590
subscribe to the podcast on Itunes,

2467
02:38:18,591 --> 02:38:23,210
stitcher and Google play and other
places that they do podcasts and leave a

2468
02:38:23,211 --> 02:38:28,120
review, leave a review. Here's
the, if you feel like, yeah,

2469
02:38:28,280 --> 02:38:32,240
that's really what it is.
Reading the reviews. But yeah,

2470
02:38:32,260 --> 02:38:37,010
if you feel like leaving one apparently
it's like, Ooh boy stuff. I don't know.

2471
02:38:37,040 --> 02:38:40,390
Yeah, good. Yeah, good, good. And
that's great for sure. That's great.

2472
02:38:40,740 --> 02:38:43,730
Helpful and spreads. What
does it do? Spread the word.

2473
02:38:43,731 --> 02:38:45,500
I think ultimately that's the benefit.

2474
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:50,680
So you don't want to see our
Jocko podcasts on you know,

2475
02:38:51,831 --> 02:38:56,510
number whatever where it
appears like between one and
10 in the business section.

2476
02:38:56,780 --> 02:38:58,130
That is good.
That's cool.

2477
02:38:59,300 --> 02:39:03,260
But really the tangible
benefit for the message is,

2478
02:39:03,320 --> 02:39:06,160
is spreading the word people.
If they get turned on to it,

2479
02:39:06,250 --> 02:39:08,150
it improves everybody's life really.

2480
02:39:08,151 --> 02:39:10,640
Because if you improve your
life in all these ways,

2481
02:39:10,641 --> 02:39:14,180
it improves like your improvement re is
a direct effect on my improvement cause

2482
02:39:14,181 --> 02:39:18,650
I hang around with you. So that's kind
of how it, so that's really the benefit.

2483
02:39:19,100 --> 02:39:22,120
So if you want to help spread the word,
yeah,

2484
02:39:22,280 --> 02:39:26,630
can write a review and if you want to
give feedback about the podcast and that's

2485
02:39:26,631 --> 02:39:29,030
a good place to do it. Yeah, I
think that's, and let's face it,

2486
02:39:29,270 --> 02:39:31,580
when you leave a review,
especially the ones that everyone leaves,

2487
02:39:31,610 --> 02:39:32,630
cause p it's kind of fun.

2488
02:39:32,720 --> 02:39:37,250
That part is fun and people aren't people
people like take time and the reviews,

2489
02:39:37,300 --> 02:39:40,680
they're not like good podcast. Yeah. Well,
actually, sometimes they do say that.

2490
02:39:41,060 --> 02:39:44,780
Good emphasis on county capital.

2491
02:39:45,020 --> 02:39:47,210
G. O. O. D. Yeah.

2492
02:39:47,450 --> 02:39:51,230
That's how fast layers layers
in the review for the day.

2493
02:39:51,870 --> 02:39:55,130
But I'm telling you. But anyway,
yeah. Hey look, if you're in the mood,

2494
02:39:55,180 --> 02:39:58,400
leave a review, you know, as long as
you're honest, that's the main thing.

2495
02:39:58,670 --> 02:40:02,030
And you know, get colorful with it if you
want. Those are actually the fun ones.

2496
02:40:02,540 --> 02:40:07,190
Like I said anyway, Lee Review.
Yeah, sure. If you, if you
feel like it a subscribe,

2497
02:40:07,191 --> 02:40:10,370
subscribe to the Youtube. We have youtube.
If you didn't know. Everyone knows.

2498
02:40:10,371 --> 02:40:12,680
I think. Yeah, cause
we see it all the time.

2499
02:40:12,710 --> 02:40:15,930
But in the event of this being the
first time, subscribe to it though.

2500
02:40:16,200 --> 02:40:16,880
Why wouldn't you?

2501
02:40:16,880 --> 02:40:21,880
Why wouldn't someone subscribe to it
if I were a person who all weight,

2502
02:40:23,191 --> 02:40:25,170
if you're listening to this
podcast, it makes sense. Yeah.

2503
02:40:25,171 --> 02:40:29,780
I don't know how many reasons there
would ever be to not, this is why.

2504
02:40:29,781 --> 02:40:33,300
That's the reason I listen
to the podcast audio. I look,

2505
02:40:33,301 --> 02:40:38,160
I go to youtube and I only watch people
playing first person shooter video

2506
02:40:38,161 --> 02:40:41,250
games. You know how that, I don't know
if you know this, but that's the thing,

2507
02:40:41,460 --> 02:40:46,460
like people will watch other people on
youtube videos playing shooter games.

2508
02:40:48,720 --> 02:40:50,400
Let's say I'm only into that,

2509
02:40:52,740 --> 02:40:56,640
I'm probably not going to subscribe or
actually this one's actually a legitimate

2510
02:40:56,641 --> 02:41:01,641
one that I can kind of dig and relate to
is if my youtube subscribing situation

2511
02:41:03,990 --> 02:41:08,990
is only two kids stuff only to get stuff
because every once in a while I get my

2512
02:41:11,701 --> 02:41:13,400
phone to my kid.
Okay.

2513
02:41:13,470 --> 02:41:17,490
And they watch like you know they watch
like Peppa pig or I dunno something.

2514
02:41:17,670 --> 02:41:19,180
Well and then when they click on,

2515
02:41:21,390 --> 02:41:25,620
a lot of times the podcast is just
what the podcast is on Youtube.

2516
02:41:25,680 --> 02:41:29,370
But like the other day you released a
deleted scene or wasn't even deleted.

2517
02:41:29,371 --> 02:41:31,760
There's a prerecording we were
just talking. Yeah before.

2518
02:41:31,800 --> 02:41:35,400
And people seem to think it was pretty
funny even I thought it was quite funny.

2519
02:41:35,420 --> 02:41:39,150
So yeah, cause when you're
detached it is really funny.

2520
02:41:39,151 --> 02:41:41,130
But the thing is if
someone wasn't listening,

2521
02:41:41,160 --> 02:41:43,470
if someone's not on subscribe to Youtube,

2522
02:41:43,500 --> 02:41:47,190
they would never know that that
existed and then you miss it.

2523
02:41:47,680 --> 02:41:50,460
I initially pretty funny. Yeah.
I thought it was funny too,

2524
02:41:51,450 --> 02:41:55,140
even though it was Kinda kinda harsh.
What'd you call me?

2525
02:41:55,141 --> 02:41:59,910
Getaway sticks or something like
that. Anyway. Yeah. See now you're,

2526
02:41:59,940 --> 02:42:03,780
you just went into the
reasons to subscribe. Oh,
there's a whole reason. Good.

2527
02:42:03,810 --> 02:42:07,710
Cause you know the excerpts
that we make put out.

2528
02:42:07,940 --> 02:42:11,820
Just cut tiny segments.
Three minutes nowadays,

2529
02:42:12,650 --> 02:42:16,920
take lead the scene was 16 you know,
that's different. But it was pretty funny.

2530
02:42:17,140 --> 02:42:19,260
Yeah. Uh, but the excerpts, you know,

2531
02:42:19,261 --> 02:42:22,560
they're just like individual ideas that
you talk about. Boom, sharable. All good.

2532
02:42:22,710 --> 02:42:27,150
That's a good reason to subscribe to
Youtube. One of the many. My opinion also,

2533
02:42:28,400 --> 02:42:32,400
Jocko has a store, it's called
Jocko store. Jocko store.com.

2534
02:42:32,401 --> 02:42:37,230
That's the URL on there. What
do we have? Shirts, rash guards,

2535
02:42:37,710 --> 02:42:42,470
rash guards. I, we started
for Jujitsu. But here's the
thing. Rash guards are first.

2536
02:42:42,471 --> 02:42:47,340
Surfing and body boarding and jacking.
Steel Jacking.

2537
02:42:47,341 --> 02:42:51,090
Steel. Yes. Cycling. These
are all, that's what really,

2538
02:42:51,730 --> 02:42:54,420
it's a spandex shirt.
There's little things.

2539
02:42:54,870 --> 02:42:58,590
The term rash guards
only applies to surfing.

2540
02:42:58,591 --> 02:43:02,520
And because you're not
worried about getting a rash
when you're lifting weights,

2541
02:43:02,521 --> 02:43:04,620
you're not worried about
getting a wreck, I guess. Yeah.

2542
02:43:04,621 --> 02:43:07,450
I guess in Jujitsu or something like this,
yeah,

2543
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:11,690
guard you against a rash
or or ringworm or whatever.

2544
02:43:12,310 --> 02:43:17,170
Nasty. Yeah. So nonetheless, I mean the
point there is that it's for everything.

2545
02:43:17,171 --> 02:43:20,070
Just because you're talking about
Jujitsu all the time, you know,

2546
02:43:20,120 --> 02:43:24,910
it's not for everything cause
I don't want to interrupt you.

2547
02:43:24,920 --> 02:43:26,940
You know, get after a
rash guard. Well that's,

2548
02:43:27,100 --> 02:43:31,540
you can speak for yourself because if I
saw someone at the club with a get after

2549
02:43:31,541 --> 02:43:35,530
it, rash guard, I would, I would
say good evening to that person. Oh,

2550
02:43:35,531 --> 02:43:39,860
that's a good point. And I
guess I can't be mad at him. No,

2551
02:43:40,890 --> 02:43:44,410
no, no rash guards when you're
out not doing activities.

2552
02:43:44,710 --> 02:43:49,330
I'm not a supporter of that. Yeah. You
know what to be, to be completely honest,

2553
02:43:49,630 --> 02:43:53,770
I don't know that I would support it.
I mean just like, Hey, I'm going out,

2554
02:43:53,771 --> 02:43:56,470
I'm going to a supermarket,
put on my good after it crashed.

2555
02:43:58,630 --> 02:44:01,170
I guess if you do this, like you never
know what's going to happen. Yeah.

2556
02:44:01,330 --> 02:44:04,290
You might want to be ready.
Right. It's true. Yeah. You know,

2557
02:44:04,310 --> 02:44:06,730
you get some good workouts
in a grocery store yourself

2558
02:44:09,030 --> 02:44:13,420
for long line, straight here in
the rash guard, your compression,

2559
02:44:13,450 --> 02:44:17,050
you're ready to absolutely true.
And you know you want to look into that.

2560
02:44:17,051 --> 02:44:21,710
Go to jungle store.com so
the shirts on there, I,

2561
02:44:21,900 --> 02:44:26,320
you know, I tried to add like a
new one every like month or so.

2562
02:44:26,590 --> 02:44:29,900
I don't know what your goal is.
I Dunno if I,

2563
02:44:30,740 --> 02:44:34,470
I've been wearing Bronson's children
tee shirt. Me Do. This is the one,

2564
02:44:34,650 --> 02:44:39,480
cause that's, that's the, that's
the shirt that you made or neutral,

2565
02:44:41,630 --> 02:44:44,980
the one that you made with my
face on it. Whatever. Dang.

2566
02:44:45,100 --> 02:44:49,390
So I'd always get caught up on the
front like ha ha, that's funny.

2567
02:44:49,840 --> 02:44:53,530
The front and all the layers in the front.
But on the back it says good evening.

2568
02:44:53,920 --> 02:44:57,280
So when you wear that one, that's when
people are going to talk to you the most.

2569
02:44:57,520 --> 02:45:00,910
You know how like you don't worry the
one with your face on it every day,

2570
02:45:01,210 --> 02:45:04,000
there's no reason for you to yeah,
it would be weird.

2571
02:45:06,620 --> 02:45:10,790
Yeah. You need to exactly enough. Nope,

2572
02:45:11,020 --> 02:45:14,650
look at that. Um, but
if you wear that one,

2573
02:45:14,680 --> 02:45:18,250
it says good evening on the back.
So I never really thought of this.

2574
02:45:18,251 --> 02:45:22,450
I haven't worn it. I don't even have
one. But that's the one I'd wear.

2575
02:45:22,451 --> 02:45:26,610
This one good people will say something,
it would look good or be like, cool,

2576
02:45:26,611 --> 02:45:28,870
you're good. It's backward. You're
sure it's backwards. I don't know.

2577
02:45:28,871 --> 02:45:32,020
Or who's that guy in your
church? Whatever. People will
will say something to you.

2578
02:45:32,350 --> 02:45:34,180
The good evening one,
they'll talk to you even more,

2579
02:45:34,540 --> 02:45:36,610
but they'll do it from behind and
they'll tell you good evening.

2580
02:45:36,850 --> 02:45:40,120
Every single time. Interesting. You
haven't worn it yet. How do you know this?

2581
02:45:40,330 --> 02:45:43,210
Cause I know, I know the
compulsion. Like I know the feeling.

2582
02:45:43,540 --> 02:45:47,020
That's my hypothesis anyway. And from
what I hear from the field anyway,

2583
02:45:47,920 --> 02:45:51,970
go on there. If you like something, get
something that's a good way to support.

2584
02:45:52,420 --> 02:45:57,030
There's some hats. Oh really? Released.

2585
02:45:57,031 --> 02:46:01,630
Coming out within one
week about that. Cool.

2586
02:46:01,750 --> 02:46:03,490
Okay. Alright. There it is.

2587
02:46:03,550 --> 02:46:08,050
I better have like nine of them lined
up at my doorstep because I need some of

2588
02:46:08,051 --> 02:46:11,480
them hats. You got it bro. I promise. Um,
so yeah, some patches on there as well.

2589
02:46:11,481 --> 02:46:14,390
Anyway, check it out. If you
like something, get something.

2590
02:46:14,580 --> 02:46:17,870
Also psychological warfare,
if you didn't know what that is,

2591
02:46:17,900 --> 02:46:19,910
it's an album with tracks.

2592
02:46:20,570 --> 02:46:23,060
Jocko tracks is Jocko talking,

2593
02:46:23,330 --> 02:46:28,330
getting you through various points
of weakness in your I've been,

2594
02:46:29,330 --> 02:46:32,390
I've been really trying to think of
a word to say other than journey.

2595
02:46:33,170 --> 02:46:35,900
I haven't yet. So we're instinct with
journey. So when you're on your journey,

2596
02:46:36,350 --> 02:46:40,790
you channel wake up, wake up
earlier, maybe I will do it.

2597
02:46:41,450 --> 02:46:43,080
You're trying to work out where you're,

2598
02:46:44,390 --> 02:46:48,590
you're trying to work out
every day, every day. No.

2599
02:46:49,010 --> 02:46:53,540
Even on rest days you're doing it
MobilityWOD for sure. Like this. Yeah man.

2600
02:46:53,541 --> 02:46:56,300
Sometimes you want to turn those,
those workout days, interest days.

2601
02:46:56,301 --> 02:47:00,320
So don't do that.
And if you need a little spot with that,

2602
02:47:00,321 --> 02:47:01,670
you listened to psychological warfare,

2603
02:47:01,671 --> 02:47:05,120
there's a track for that for any
point of weakness. Like I said,

2604
02:47:06,890 --> 02:47:11,600
get after it. Psychological
warfare, Amazon music, iTunes,

2605
02:47:11,900 --> 02:47:16,670
various other MP3 outlets,
Jocko Willink. And now,

2606
02:47:16,820 --> 02:47:19,790
uh, first, if you haven't heard yet,

2607
02:47:20,930 --> 02:47:23,150
we are now in the league

2608
02:47:24,710 --> 02:47:29,710
with origin USA little company and we
are now a part of it has been months in

2609
02:47:32,421 --> 02:47:33,254
the making.

2610
02:47:33,470 --> 02:47:38,470
We've been going back and forth with my
boy Pete Roberts and who actually this

2611
02:47:40,941 --> 02:47:42,080
is you went up about layers.

2612
02:47:42,240 --> 02:47:46,910
The reason that we are linked up in the
beginning was because of Sarah Armstrong.

2613
02:47:47,120 --> 02:47:51,770
Sure. Who, who heard me talking
about how cool origin was.

2614
02:47:51,850 --> 02:47:55,850
Yeah. That they make everything
in America. And she sent
Pete an email and said,

2615
02:47:55,851 --> 02:47:58,400
hey, I know you run this company
and this guy was talking about you.

2616
02:47:58,400 --> 02:48:00,200
You guys are talking to each other.
Guess what?

2617
02:48:00,201 --> 02:48:02,870
We talked and now we're getting after it.

2618
02:48:03,590 --> 02:48:08,590
And we joined forces and so we're
planning all kinds of things and uh,

2619
02:48:09,800 --> 02:48:14,450
gear [inaudible], rash guards,
planting some supplements.

2620
02:48:14,451 --> 02:48:18,620
And believe it or not, is the
rash guard back in stock? Not yet.

2621
02:48:18,770 --> 02:48:23,090
We were doing a little, we're doing a lot
of building right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2622
02:48:23,590 --> 02:48:26,630
Uh, but we got all kinds of
things coming basically. You know,

2623
02:48:26,690 --> 02:48:30,950
basically I want to make everything
that I used to get after it. Yeah.

2624
02:48:30,951 --> 02:48:34,630
I want to make so,
so everything and um,

2625
02:48:34,870 --> 02:48:36,980
and when I say everything
is not a long list,

2626
02:48:37,160 --> 02:48:38,790
I don't use that much
stuff to get after it.

2627
02:48:39,440 --> 02:48:44,440
I use a pretty small list but I want
to make it and I want to make it in

2628
02:48:45,360 --> 02:48:48,290
America.
So if you wanna check it out,

2629
02:48:48,291 --> 02:48:52,760
check out origin main.com cause it's in
New England, which are where I'm from.

2630
02:48:53,190 --> 02:48:56,180
It no big deal. Layers, layers. Indeed.

2631
02:48:56,300 --> 02:48:59,240
And also if you want to get into it,

2632
02:48:59,450 --> 02:49:02,360
like now you want to find
out really what's going on.

2633
02:49:02,510 --> 02:49:05,850
There's an origin immersion, Jujitsu
camp in Maine. I had realized,

2634
02:49:05,860 --> 02:49:07,350
I hadn't even explained what is

2635
02:49:08,520 --> 02:49:11,160
you receipt. Oh see I'm from New
England so I know what this is.

2636
02:49:11,161 --> 02:49:15,030
I know what after camp is you, you may
or may not know people in other parts.

2637
02:49:15,031 --> 02:49:15,960
Of course you may or may not know.

2638
02:49:16,160 --> 02:49:20,490
A camp in this form is in this
situation it's a big lake.

2639
02:49:21,300 --> 02:49:24,360
And on the lake there's a property and
on the property they have a bunch of

2640
02:49:24,361 --> 02:49:28,170
little cabins, a bunch of
them, like multiple cabins.

2641
02:49:28,710 --> 02:49:32,700
And when you go to a camp you stay in
the cabins and then they have a kind of a

2642
02:49:32,701 --> 02:49:37,680
central area.
Well we are renting out the entire camp.

2643
02:49:38,340 --> 02:49:42,120
I don't know how many cabinets, like
dozens and dozens of cabins. Right.

2644
02:49:42,660 --> 02:49:45,330
All these things on a lake.

2645
02:49:45,690 --> 02:49:48,000
And then there's a main
kind of gathering area.

2646
02:49:48,030 --> 02:49:50,430
Well guess what we're putting in the make
it guess what we're putting into main

2647
02:49:50,431 --> 02:49:52,540
gathering area.
Lynn on the Mat.

2648
02:49:53,880 --> 02:49:58,230
So we're gonna go, you know, if
you want to come, you come up,

2649
02:49:58,260 --> 02:50:00,330
you come to Maine,
it's three hours from Boston.

2650
02:50:00,331 --> 02:50:03,450
It's an half an hour from
Augusta, Maine. We're going to be,

2651
02:50:03,451 --> 02:50:07,920
their echo and I are going to be
there Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.

2652
02:50:07,921 --> 02:50:09,870
There's two sessions that are going on.

2653
02:50:09,900 --> 02:50:14,900
The first one's the 20 the
20th through the 23rd I think.

2654
02:50:15,990 --> 02:50:19,010
Yeah. The 20th through the 23rd so
echo and I are gonna be there Tuesday,

2655
02:50:19,010 --> 02:50:20,970
Wednesday, Thursday. We're going
to be a part of both sessions

2656
02:50:22,710 --> 02:50:27,030
and so come to that. And what we're going
to do is we're going to train Jujitsu,

2657
02:50:27,510 --> 02:50:29,370
but you can only train Jiu
Jitsu so many hours a day.

2658
02:50:29,820 --> 02:50:31,050
So what else are we gonna do?

2659
02:50:31,080 --> 02:50:33,450
We're gonna hang out with
the cruise cruise big time.

2660
02:50:33,600 --> 02:50:34,530
We're going to do some kind of,

2661
02:50:34,560 --> 02:50:37,650
there's a big lake there so
you can't surf from the lake,

2662
02:50:37,651 --> 02:50:39,870
but we'll figure something.
Water activity out. Right.

2663
02:50:40,950 --> 02:50:44,190
And they're making lobster.
And I don't like lobster,

2664
02:50:44,191 --> 02:50:47,910
but I'm going to have steak and you
can have lobster and, and uh, yeah.

2665
02:50:47,940 --> 02:50:51,960
So we're gonna be hanging out weight.
The lake is the lake cold?

2666
02:50:51,961 --> 02:50:55,080
Can we swim in the lake? You can swim in
the lake raising cold. How cold it is.

2667
02:50:55,230 --> 02:50:57,210
I don't know,
but I don't know the temperature of light,

2668
02:50:57,230 --> 02:51:01,170
but main summertime it will be. It
was not going to be freezing. Okay.

2669
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:05,190
I don't think. And if it is good,
it's good for your muscles recover.

2670
02:51:06,110 --> 02:51:08,400
And also during the,
so during this thing too,

2671
02:51:08,670 --> 02:51:11,450
if you come up or if you can't make that
and you wanna come up for this. Anyways,

2672
02:51:11,490 --> 02:51:16,490
we're having the grand opening of
our new origin factory in Farmington,

2673
02:51:16,741 --> 02:51:20,490
Maine. So big factory, 20,000 square feet,

2674
02:51:20,491 --> 02:51:23,080
I think it's bigger than
20,000 square feet. Uh,

2675
02:51:23,510 --> 02:51:26,580
everyone's invited to that calm hangout.
You know, I was thinking we'd do like,

2676
02:51:26,581 --> 02:51:31,440
we'll do like a Q and a or something.
We'll hang out. We'll bro, I'm Rick books.

2677
02:51:31,510 --> 02:51:34,650
We'll just, we'll just kick
it. So come up to that.

2678
02:51:34,680 --> 02:51:38,880
That is the 23rd of August in
Maine. Common hang out. Like I said,

2679
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:43,020
what is the Jujitsu part of it? What,
how does that work? Like the, you know,

2680
02:51:43,021 --> 02:51:46,920
there's two weeks you can go for the
whole thing. No, it's not two weeks.

2681
02:51:47,100 --> 02:51:50,850
It's a one week long. It's from the 20th
to the 27th. What is brutal? Two sessions.

2682
02:51:50,950 --> 02:51:54,030
So, so what do you mean sessions?
Like what? We all just roll.

2683
02:51:54,031 --> 02:51:58,460
You have different teachers. There's
different teachers, but, but you know,

2684
02:51:58,470 --> 02:52:02,400
I think we're doing, I think it's three
sessions a day of Jujitsu. Yeah. I mean,

2685
02:52:02,401 --> 02:52:05,590
how, how many sessions can you roll hard
at? So some of them can be like, hey,

2686
02:52:05,591 --> 02:52:07,120
you know, I'll drill some
technique with you. Or Hey,

2687
02:52:07,121 --> 02:52:08,970
maybe you could go over some foot
lock stuff with me or whatever.

2688
02:52:08,980 --> 02:52:11,340
You know what I mean? Yeah. I think
there's gonna be some of that and,

2689
02:52:11,380 --> 02:52:14,470
but then there's also a bunch of different
black belts are going to be there to

2690
02:52:14,471 --> 02:52:18,810
hang out, show moves. So you're immersion.

2691
02:52:18,910 --> 02:52:20,140
That's how you learn.
Gotcha.

2692
02:52:20,260 --> 02:52:24,940
So I know Naco Nolan's coming to that
from the west coast. He's coming out.

2693
02:52:24,941 --> 02:52:28,990
He does. He hit me up. So yeah, come on
up to that. We're gonna have a good time.

2694
02:52:29,950 --> 02:52:32,200
Also when we're there,
we're going to have some Jocko white tea.

2695
02:52:34,210 --> 02:52:38,680
So if there's anyone that wants to
instantly dead lift 8,000 pounds,

2696
02:52:38,740 --> 02:52:43,660
you can get the Jocko white tea.
If you need to crush an academic test,

2697
02:52:44,980 --> 02:52:48,910
get Jocko white tea if you
need some. Right now, you
can get some on Amazon books.

2698
02:52:48,911 --> 02:52:49,870
We've got some books

2699
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:56,080
for your kid or whatever, kids, you know
we've got the way of the warrior kid.

2700
02:52:57,550 --> 02:52:59,050
There's lessons in there for everybody.

2701
02:52:59,080 --> 02:53:03,610
Check it out if you want the first
edition of discipline equals freedom field

2702
02:53:03,611 --> 02:53:04,240
manual,

2703
02:53:04,240 --> 02:53:08,620
order it soon or go to your bookstore
and tell him you want to get it.

2704
02:53:08,650 --> 02:53:11,950
Preordered it whenever you got
to do Amazon, Barnes and nobles,

2705
02:53:11,980 --> 02:53:16,450
your local bookstore, get it.
Now I'm going to tell you,

2706
02:53:16,780 --> 02:53:20,980
don't get this book for
your Wine Sipping Book Club,

2707
02:53:22,090 --> 02:53:25,720
not a book for them. They won't
like it. You're part of that club.

2708
02:53:25,721 --> 02:53:28,240
Don't get it for them. You can still get
it, but don't bring it to the book club.

2709
02:53:28,720 --> 02:53:31,030
They're, they're, they're sipping
wine. They're not in a game.

2710
02:53:33,580 --> 02:53:36,280
But if you want to get
stronger, tougher, smarter,

2711
02:53:36,310 --> 02:53:40,750
healthier and more prepared all around,
better person.

2712
02:53:41,650 --> 02:53:44,170
Get the book disciplining
cause for your field.

2713
02:53:44,171 --> 02:53:49,171
Manual comes out October 17th which
means they're printing it almost now.

2714
02:53:52,030 --> 02:53:54,640
So that means if you don't order
it isn't going to be backed up.

2715
02:53:54,850 --> 02:53:57,160
You're not going to have it.
Everyone else is going to have it.

2716
02:53:57,350 --> 02:53:58,540
You going have an edge on you,

2717
02:53:59,410 --> 02:54:02,160
maybe you never recover like that
battle I was talking about earlier.

2718
02:54:02,180 --> 02:54:04,680
You know someone else gets the
edge on you. You just get Megan.

2719
02:54:05,590 --> 02:54:09,670
Also extreme ownership, own it, refer
to it, highlight it, implement it,

2720
02:54:09,671 --> 02:54:12,820
spread the word, get it for your
team, your company, your organization.

2721
02:54:13,660 --> 02:54:18,280
Wrote that with my brother Leif Babin.
So if you don't have that,

2722
02:54:18,310 --> 02:54:20,740
then you have copies for every
single person that you've ever known.

2723
02:54:21,040 --> 02:54:25,180
Get it for him. Also, Echelon
Front Leadership Consulting,

2724
02:54:25,540 --> 02:54:30,130
assessments, instruction
me, Leif, Babin, JP Denelle,

2725
02:54:30,160 --> 02:54:30,993
Dave Burke.

2726
02:54:32,540 --> 02:54:37,540
Get the team organized and coordinated
for action and for victory.

2727
02:54:38,090 --> 02:54:42,980
That's my recommendation.
If you want to get that process going,

2728
02:54:43,250 --> 02:54:47,030
email info,
an echelon front.com finally,

2729
02:54:47,031 --> 02:54:51,860
the monster is September
14th and 15th in San Diego.

2730
02:54:51,920 --> 02:54:56,920
All the other monsters have sold more
than half the tickets for San Diego have

2731
02:54:57,051 --> 02:55:01,490
already sold out.
So this is going to sell out.

2732
02:55:01,610 --> 02:55:04,010
Don't get left out in the cold.
You can register

2733
02:55:04,010 --> 02:55:06,530
at extreme ownership, dark, calm.

2734
02:55:07,730 --> 02:55:12,170
And if you need to talk to us before you
see us at the immersion camp in Maine

2735
02:55:13,190 --> 02:55:18,170
and before you go to the monster in San
Diego, you can find us on the interwebs,

2736
02:55:19,220 --> 02:55:21,980
the Twitter,
the Instagram,

2737
02:55:23,540 --> 02:55:27,950
that Facebook key keyboard and also,

2738
02:55:28,930 --> 02:55:29,750
okay,

2739
02:55:29,750 --> 02:55:33,500
snapchat. You're on
snapchat. I'm on it. I'm,

2740
02:55:33,830 --> 02:55:37,730
I'm learning from my children. Okay, good.

2741
02:55:37,790 --> 02:55:39,170
That's the way people communicate.

2742
02:55:39,171 --> 02:55:42,980
Now the snapchat and I looked
one of the pages. Guess what?

2743
02:55:43,460 --> 02:55:46,640
Wall Street Journal's on there. The
economist is on there. It's not,

2744
02:55:46,790 --> 02:55:51,470
it's not this thing for your teenage
14 year old kid anymore. Well it is,

2745
02:55:51,471 --> 02:55:56,040
but yeah, well maybe I got out of the
basement as well, so maybe, I don't know.

2746
02:55:56,090 --> 02:55:57,650
There must be something to it.
I don't know.

2747
02:55:57,651 --> 02:56:00,290
I'm talking to rubbish but
like I have a snapchat,

2748
02:56:00,350 --> 02:56:02,180
I don't use it and I haven't like,
you know,

2749
02:56:02,181 --> 02:56:04,190
I think you've got to
like confirm your account.

2750
02:56:04,550 --> 02:56:08,240
I was doing it because my daughter
likes to make the faces crazy faces.

2751
02:56:08,330 --> 02:56:09,710
My youngest daughter likes to do that too.

2752
02:56:10,160 --> 02:56:13,610
So she did it on my wife's phone all
the time, and then she hit me up for it.

2753
02:56:13,610 --> 02:56:17,600
Like, Hey, let me do, she call it
snapchat. So she's like, let me snap chat.

2754
02:56:17,601 --> 02:56:20,840
She doesn't know what it is. She thinks
it's just a face. So I'm like, all right.

2755
02:56:20,841 --> 02:56:24,410
So I tried to do it. Then somehow I've got
to confirm. I was like, Nah. So I didn't.

2756
02:56:24,650 --> 02:56:28,730
But um, yeah, I guess I'm like one foot
in one foot out kind of thing. Well,

2757
02:56:28,731 --> 02:56:31,700
I'm not really, I haven't
posted anything yet. Yeah,

2758
02:56:33,200 --> 02:56:36,560
I almost did. I'm sure I was like trying
to figure it out. Yeah. Yeah. Dang,

2759
02:56:36,561 --> 02:56:39,860
that's good man. But jade told me, well,
this is what Jay told me, which was smart.

2760
02:56:39,980 --> 02:56:44,510
Yeah, this is what Jay told me, your
brother Jade. I said, you know, it's just,

2761
02:56:44,511 --> 02:56:47,840
I don't really understand it. And he goes,
that's why you need to do it. I know.

2762
02:56:50,050 --> 02:56:53,660
I said to myself, okay, you're
right. Don't like, Oh, oh,
I'm afraid of something.

2763
02:56:53,900 --> 02:56:57,500
Why am I afraid of it? Don't understand
it. How do you overcome that? Yeah,

2764
02:56:57,650 --> 02:57:02,650
because apparently it's a good method of
communication and men J and not to say

2765
02:57:02,840 --> 02:57:04,940
jade said so, so it's
right. I'm not saying that,

2766
02:57:04,941 --> 02:57:07,850
but he's real smart with that kind
of stuff. Like he knows, he see,

2767
02:57:07,851 --> 02:57:11,900
he knows the trends so he can like
predict shit. Those were stuff like how,

2768
02:57:12,050 --> 02:57:14,720
you know, how like how it will work
and who's going to, he is. In fact,

2769
02:57:15,200 --> 02:57:17,060
what he does now is AI,

2770
02:57:17,090 --> 02:57:19,820
artificial intelligence with
applications and stuff like that.

2771
02:57:19,850 --> 02:57:21,440
So he knows that stuff.

2772
02:57:21,441 --> 02:57:24,860
So it's like when he kind of says he
can't help but be like, ah, you're right.

2773
02:57:24,980 --> 02:57:26,420
You know, even if you
don't know, you're like,

2774
02:57:26,421 --> 02:57:29,270
well consider the source kind of thing.
In fact,

2775
02:57:29,271 --> 02:57:32,630
he got me into cryptocurrency investment,

2776
02:57:32,850 --> 02:57:37,040
so investment and I'm up 30% that's all
I'm going to say about it. So I'm like,

2777
02:57:37,080 --> 02:57:40,510
alright. Yeah, hate to give him him
the credit for that. But you can't,

2778
02:57:40,520 --> 02:57:42,500
you can't help it. Yeah. Good.

2779
02:57:43,280 --> 02:57:47,600
Well you can find us on the interwebs.
Echo is an echo.

2780
02:57:47,601 --> 02:57:51,230
Charles and I am at Jocko Willink.
And finally,

2781
02:57:51,260 --> 02:57:54,890
thanks to everyone that
makes this podcast possible.

2782
02:57:56,090 --> 02:57:57,230
First,
our military.

2783
02:57:58,520 --> 02:57:59,280
Okay,

2784
02:57:59,280 --> 02:58:02,580
whose strength and true warrior

2785
02:58:02,580 --> 02:58:06,840
culture allows us the freedom
to do what we want to do.

2786
02:58:07,950 --> 02:58:12,750
And thanks to the police, law
enforcement, firefighters,

2787
02:58:12,870 --> 02:58:13,710
paramedics,

2788
02:58:13,740 --> 02:58:18,740
first responders who are ever
vigilant and always ready.

2789
02:58:19,930 --> 02:58:24,930
I was just driving back from Yosemite
and their big forest fires up there and

2790
02:58:26,020 --> 02:58:30,550
all kinds of people had signs out
saying thanks to the firefighters.

2791
02:58:30,551 --> 02:58:34,210
So thanks for you guys up there in
the mountains fighting the fires

2792
02:58:35,800 --> 02:58:40,540
and to the rest of you
that are out there working,

2793
02:58:40,630 --> 02:58:42,760
building,
making.

2794
02:58:42,930 --> 02:58:47,800
It's squeezing every
ounce of life that you can

2795
02:58:49,810 --> 02:58:53,800
crushing every minute
of every day out there,

2796
02:58:53,801 --> 02:58:58,801
leading in the face of adversity and
doing everything you can to be everything

2797
02:59:00,251 --> 02:59:04,010
you can.
All you.

2798
02:59:04,880 --> 02:59:09,560
Thanks for being in the game with us.
And thanks for getting after it.

2799
02:59:11,390 --> 02:59:13,220
So until next time,

2800
02:59:13,970 --> 02:59:17,270
this is echo and Jocko out.
