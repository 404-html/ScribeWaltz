00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,550
This is Jocko podcast number
69 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:07,503
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:08,620
Yeah.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,660
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,470
The president of the United States takes
pride in presenting the metal of honor

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,770
posthumously to Captain Henry,

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,280
t l Rod United States Marine Corps.

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:27,340
Okay.

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,760
For Service as set forth
in the following citation.

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,570
Okay.

11
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,840
For conspicuous gallantry and
interpretative [inaudible].

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:37,460
Okay.

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,170
At the risk of his life above and
beyond the call of Duty Wall attached to

14
00:00:42,171 --> 00:00:47,171
marine of fighting squadron 211 during
action against the Japanese land surface

15
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:54,610
and air really units at wake
island from eight to 23 December,

16
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,283
1941

17
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,290
okay.

18
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:03,290
Engaging vastly superior forces
of enemy bombers and warships.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,370
On nine and 12 December,

20
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:10,550
Captain El Rodd shot down to have a
flight of 22 hostile planes and executing

21
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:18,021
repeated bombing and strafing runs at
extremely low altitude and close range.

22
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,890
Succeeded in inflicting deadly
damage upon a large Japanese vessel,

23
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,080
thereby sinking the first major war ship
to be destroyed by small caliber bombs

24
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,480
delivered from a fighter type aircraft.

25
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,420
Okay.

26
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,220
When his plane was disabled by hostile
fire and no other ships were operative.

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,280
Captain El Rod assumed command of one
flank of the line set up in defiance of

28
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:48,461
the enemy landing and conducting a
brilliant defense enabled his men to hold

29
00:01:48,531 --> 00:01:50,240
their positions and repulsed,

30
00:01:50,241 --> 00:01:55,241
determined enemy attacks repeatedly
proceeding through intense hostile few

31
00:01:56,761 --> 00:02:01,761
salons to provide covering fire
for unarmed ammunition carriers.

32
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:04,830
Okay.

33
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:09,090
Capturing an automatic weapon
during one enemy rushing force.

34
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,350
He gave his own firearm to one of his
men and fought on vigorously against the

35
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:14,190
Japanese.

36
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,070
Okay.

37
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,300
Responsible in a large measure
of the strength of his sectors.

38
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,500
Gallons resistance.
On 23 December,

39
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,930
Captain El Rod led his men with bold,

40
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:31,310
aggressive aggressiveness
until he fell mortally wounded.

41
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:33,880
Okay.

42
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,100
His superb skill as a pilot,

43
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:41,490
daring leadership in unswerving devotion
to duty distinguished him among the

44
00:02:42,251 --> 00:02:43,840
defenders of wake island.

45
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:45,150
Yeah.

46
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,440
And His Valliant conduct reflects
the highest credit upon himself.

47
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,020
Okay.

48
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,000
And United States naval service.

49
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,040
He gallantly gave his
life for his country,

50
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,180
signed Harry s Truman,

51
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:12,450
and that is the medal of honor
citation for Henry Talmage l Rod,

52
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:18,961
the first aviator in world war two to
be awarded the medal of honor and the

53
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:21,760
first man to sink a warship
from a fighter plane.

54
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,973
Okay.

55
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,930
During the battle of wake island.

56
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:28,300
And if you don't know anything
about the battle of wake island,

57
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:33,301
it began simultaneously with the attack
on Pearl Harbor when that started,

58
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,560
and it ended on 23 December,

59
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,580
1941 when American forces
were forced to surrender,

60
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,420
then that was with around
500 American servicemen.

61
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,620
And they had a handful of
coastal artillery pieces and
a handful of antiaircraft

62
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,200
guns and they had 12 aircraft.

63
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:05,190
And what they were facing was 2,500
Japanese infantry supported by three light

64
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:12,130
cruisers, eight destroyers to
patrol boats, to troop transports,

65
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,300
to aircraft carriers with all their
planes and too heavy cruisers.

66
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,980
So you were completely outnumbered
and completely and utterly outgunned.

67
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,020
But they held out for 15 days and
while they were under that siege

68
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,810
on the 20th of December,

69
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,350
while the Japanese were
preparing for their final attack.

70
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,253
Okay.

71
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:44,470
Major El rod got out one
last letter to his wife.

72
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,573
Okay.

73
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,050
They're not going to read that to you.

74
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,380
Saturday 20 December,

75
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,960
1941 my dearest darling sweetheart,

76
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,390
I never suspected this afternoon
when I wrote my other short note,

77
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,070
but I would be sitting down writing
another tonight. But here we are.

78
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,710
I just got in a few minutes ago and
I've just learned that Walt Baylor is

79
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:19,490
returning and he has kindly consented
to deliver to this personally.

80
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,310
So I am very thankful for the moment.

81
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,080
Of course there isn't a lot of news that
I can write about and you probably know

82
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,360
more real news than I do.
Anyhow.

83
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:39,090
I am missing you terribly and I'm
undergoing a few new experiences,

84
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,550
but also is everyone else.

85
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,290
We've had considerable rain
today and it is still cloudy.

86
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,070
The wind has been very low.
However,

87
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,530
the weather on the whole is
nothing to complain about.

88
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,050
But I would like to see

89
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,070
a good old fashioned ties
foun sweep this entire area.

90
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,280
I imagine there was an awful lot of white
washing going on now in high places.

91
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:13,350
It's certainly will be a criminal
shame if they succeed in covering over

92
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:14,184
everything.

93
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,530
I am writing this in something of a
hurry and under somewhat difficult

94
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:22,670
circumstances.

95
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,760
I'll think of a million things that I
should have said after I had gone to bed

96
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:29,594
tonight.

97
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,610
But now I'm going to say that I love
you and you alone always and always and

98
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:39,800
repeated a million times or so.

99
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:47,000
Give my love to Mary. Also
between the two of you,

100
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,320
you have it all.

101
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,850
There isn't any for anyone else.

102
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,480
I know that you are praying for me and
I have nothing more to ask than that.

103
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:02,740
Your prayers be answered.

104
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,860
Yours devotedly and loving

105
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,383
Talmage.

106
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,633
Yeah.

107
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,960
And so I think it's important

108
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,173
that,

109
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,420
but when you hear that letter,
you recognize the fact that this is a,

110
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,633
this is a man.

111
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,350
And of course we always remember that

112
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,790
these men,
we call them,

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
we called them heroes, deservedly. So.

114
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,010
We do that to honor them.

115
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,540
But I think it's important
to always remember

116
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,370
that these heroes,

117
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,180
there are people,

118
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,323
they're people

119
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,020
and these men, these
heroes, these marines,

120
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,460
these people that held the line,

121
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,720
they held the line for 15 days
before they were forced to surrender.

122
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,940
After losing 49 Marines killed,
two missing in action.

123
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,770
Three navy personnel killed
70 US civilians killed.

124
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,401
And by the way,

125
00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:40,401
the Japanese losses were recorded
about 820 killed with over 300 wounded,

126
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,820
two destroyers lost

127
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,380
and almost 30 Japanese
aircraft shot down or damaged.

128
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,150
But the odds in the

129
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,450
ratio of force was just stacked against,

130
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,460
okay,

131
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,520
the u s forces on wake island. And when
you get into a situation like that,

132
00:09:10,521 --> 00:09:14,360
a dire situation,
no violence situation,

133
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,930
a situation where you are
facing a determined enemy,

134
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,553
there is

135
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:29,090
a bond that forms between
people regardless of where
they're from or what their

136
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:36,351
background is or what their socio economic
classes or what service they were.

137
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:39,360
And none of that matters.

138
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,230
There's a bond that forms
that cannot be broken.

139
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:56,450
And we certainly had that
in the battle of Ramadi,

140
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:02,810
US Army soldiers,
United States,

141
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,150
marines,
CBS,

142
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,890
our seals of task unit, bruiser, bruiser,

143
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,600
all of us that were in
that fight had that bond.

144
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,360
We were brothers

145
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,820
and tonight

146
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:34,520
I am honored to have one of those brothers

147
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,720
here with me

148
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:42,660
and he's a Marine Corps aviator,
a fighter pilot

149
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:49,590
who also did time as a forward air
controller on the ground and we've talked

150
00:10:50,051 --> 00:10:53,890
about that in many of the books that
we've reviewed on the podcast where you

151
00:10:53,891 --> 00:10:58,891
have a marine corps pilot who's
now on the ground with the troops,

152
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,650
usually in one of the most
forward positions because
they have to know where the

153
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:04,484
troops are

154
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,823
out of that

155
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:13,770
air conditioned cockpit and into
the sweat in mud on the ground.

156
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:15,754
And this,

157
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:23,190
this pilot as an Anglico team leader
who with his team conducted dozens and

158
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:26,650
dozens of missions with task unit
bruiser in Ramadi and I've talked about

159
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:30,430
bringing him on the show
and so here he is tonight,

160
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,810
lieutenant colonel almost retired,

161
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,830
David Burke.
Dave,

162
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:45,050
welcome to the podcast and
thank you for coming on.

163
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,170
Thanks for having me, man.
It's going to be here.

164
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:54,280
So we have to,
before

165
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,230
we talk about what we
went through together,

166
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:59,320
we have to learn a little bit about you,
where you of came from,

167
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:04,380
what you did and how you
went from being from being a,

168
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,220
you know, a pilot but not
just a pilot, a top gun pilot,

169
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:12,940
but not just the top gun pilot
but a but a top gun instructor,

170
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,130
which is just incredibly selective.

171
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:23,180
That's gotta be one of the most selective
things in the whole world. Right.

172
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,590
How many top gun pilots are there?
See about 25 at a time.

173
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:29,890
Every three years they kind of
rotate through small group. Yeah.

174
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:34,480
So that's a ridiculous,
and, and then, you know,

175
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:36,880
you've thought maybe I, you need
to get after it a little bit more.

176
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,830
So you're going to go do an egg coastal.
We'll get into that.

177
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:42,670
But let's start off with,
with where you came from.

178
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,150
Just a little bit about your background
and how you ended up saying, you know,

179
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:50,640
when I think I want to do, be in the
Marine Corps. Yup. Go right on. Um,

180
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,350
so I actually grew up around here.

181
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,300
My parents moved out here in San Diego
and I was probably a year and a half

182
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,330
years old. I wanted a half years old
in between here in Orange County.

183
00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:00,130
I grew up in southern California kid.

184
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,150
I'm not all that exciting with childhood.

185
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:07,540
I don't have a ton of crazy memories.
I was a pretty quiet kid.

186
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:11,090
He's a good kid in school.
Got Along with most folks. Um,

187
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,540
mood at Orange County.
My parents got divorced.

188
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,660
It was basically just me and my mom
and my sister for awhile. And, uh,

189
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,940
I lived in a town called El Toro.

190
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:23,140
And what happened to be very close to
where I grew up was a marine base as a

191
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:25,030
fighter base.
And so as a kid,

192
00:13:25,031 --> 00:13:28,480
I pause there and late
seventies and early eighties,

193
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:33,481
they had f four phantoms and a fours and
a six isn't just the cool jets at the

194
00:13:34,211 --> 00:13:37,210
time. And so, uh, I went
to the air show every year,

195
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,300
grew up out there and I think
it was no joke, it was overhead.

196
00:13:40,301 --> 00:13:43,660
I could see it in every day. And I think
that has gotten my blood a little bit.

197
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,870
Uh,
went to El Toro high school,

198
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,290
went to the air show probably every year
from last six years old til the time

199
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:54,070
that base closed down. No joke. I mean
it was just part of my life. And uh,

200
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:55,570
you know, I met some people
along the way too. You know,

201
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,530
there's a lot of marines live in there,

202
00:13:56,531 --> 00:14:00,880
so I had some real powerful influences
that kind of guided me towards that. Um,

203
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,680
I'm sure we're going to get into this
because it's come up already in the pre

204
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,130
conversation, but in around 14, let's say,

205
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,120
watch this obscure movie
called a top gun trade up top.

206
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:14,500
The Guy Straight up man, uh,
watch the movie as a kid. Uh,

207
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:19,240
saw dude's flying airplanes off carriers
shooting down megs and I'm like,

208
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:24,130
I want to do that.
And probably by 14,

209
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:27,480
I had a pretty good idea. That's
what I wanted to do. Um, did,

210
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:31,270
did you make the connection between
school and grades and all that stuff?

211
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:34,210
Because a lot of people saw that movie and
said, Oh, I want to be a top gun pilot,

212
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,490
but I'm still going to slack off and
do whatever I want and not, you know,

213
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,920
play hooky and all that.
Somehow you made that connection.

214
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,500
It's not shown in the movie.
Right.

215
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:45,610
They didn't show people studying hard in
school because that would have not sold

216
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:50,050
a lot of tickets. I
did eventually. I mean,

217
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:52,450
when I watched that movie,
I think they're just something I,

218
00:14:52,451 --> 00:14:53,690
I'd always been interested in aviation.

219
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:56,350
It's kind of captivating when you see
planes flying around and gets in the air

220
00:14:56,351 --> 00:14:57,670
show, see the blue angels,
that kind of stuff.

221
00:14:57,671 --> 00:15:00,890
You can't help a look up and
watch that stuff. It's cool. Um,

222
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,710
I would say that my performance in the
academic arena was slightly less than

223
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:11,500
stellar. I was, I did fine, but I had
no real motivation to do anything. Um,

224
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:15,380
I wasn't a real driven kid
to, uh, to work really hard.

225
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,320
I kind of discovered that if I put
in very little effort, I was okay.

226
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,760
And if I wanted to do really well,

227
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:22,100
how to put in a lot of effort and
I hadn't made much of a connection,

228
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:26,030
but so as I got a little older, you know,
you know, I watched the movie, you know,

229
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:29,000
I think I was a part of a lot of different
things. But about the time I was 16,

230
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:31,980
so kind of junior year in high school,
um,

231
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,940
as I got some other influences in my
life and my biggest one was a guy named

232
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,570
Aaron urban.

233
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,990
I started working at target around the
corner from my house and as a marine

234
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,650
there. And like I said, my
parents got divorced. Um,

235
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,340
I had a stepdad that was there
and kind of come and gone.

236
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,150
He ended up being a really big father
figure in my life and a real positive

237
00:15:47,151 --> 00:15:49,400
influence and a marine,
which was great.

238
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:52,910
And he explained some more things about
what it's like to be a marine. He,

239
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,000
he's the one that made the connection
for me that all that stuff you saw in the

240
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:58,070
movies, you can actually do
that for real. The Marine Corps,

241
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,950
you can do that as a marine. You know,
it's not just a movie that's a real life.

242
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:05,450
Somebody is living that life right
now and you can do that. And uh,

243
00:16:05,451 --> 00:16:08,510
I remember coming home and kind of telling
my mom like, Hey, I'm, you know, I'm 16,

244
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:11,480
I'm a junior high school. I'm thinking
about being a Marine Corps fighter pilot,

245
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,710
which I had no military in my background.

246
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,130
Nobody had ever done anything
like that. And her answer was, uh,

247
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,320
sounds awesome. You should do that.
I mean, just a hundred percent.

248
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:24,320
And she had a very similar approach.
Uh, you know, everything, every,

249
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:28,520
every idea I've ever had in my life that
I run by my mom, she was like, well,

250
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,900
is going to do it might as well be you.

251
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,910
That was kind of our approach to
everything. I want to be a fighter pilot,

252
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:33,890
the marine corps, someone's going
to be, it might as well be you.

253
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,270
And that's about the time I kind of
started getting my stuff together a little

254
00:16:38,271 --> 00:16:40,040
bit. I wasn't a mass but
by any stretch, but I,

255
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,070
I was a little bit just
kind of running through.

256
00:16:42,071 --> 00:16:45,290
I do my thing being a kid and um,
uh,

257
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:50,291
I certainly think I was lucky because I
knew with great detail at about 16 and

258
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:54,350
change what I wanted to do.

259
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,770
I mean I knew I wanted to be a marine
corps fat and pilot based in southern

260
00:16:57,771 --> 00:17:01,790
California and if we'll have carriers
and that's exactly what ended up doing.

261
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:06,380
So at that time everything has started
to do from there was with that kind of

262
00:17:06,381 --> 00:17:08,750
singular focus of
circling back to do that.

263
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,280
I even knew I wanted to be stationed at
El Toro and I had a real specific plan.

264
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,990
And so all of the things I started doing
from their school into college as well,

265
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,840
uh, go into the marine recruiter to
say I wanted to join the marine corps,

266
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,190
be an officer in the Marine Corps.

267
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,190
All those things were geared very
specifically towards that goal.

268
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:27,770
And now there's a ton of horror hurdles
between the time you're 16 and time.

269
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:28,970
I got my commission at 21,

270
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:34,490
but everything else that I did in my life
was either a distraction that just got

271
00:17:34,491 --> 00:17:37,150
rid of or it was a means to that end.
Uh,

272
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:41,600
I worked full time while I was in school
putting myself through the nearest

273
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,920
college. Uh, you know, the, the local
state school that I live close to.

274
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:47,000
I just drove up to school,

275
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,920
didn't have like a real big exciting
college life in a fraternity.

276
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,940
It didn't go away to school.
Uh,

277
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,870
I paid my way through a school
and I got a good education.

278
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,760
I worked really hard to, to, to do well,

279
00:17:56,761 --> 00:18:00,030
but it was all specifically designed to
do you want to be in the Marine Corps

280
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:02,880
and be an officer? You need
a college graduate, you need
to be a college graduate.

281
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,460
Right on. I can do that.
I can do that here.

282
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,710
Closest College towards the courses
in college. Uh, how much does it cost?

283
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,120
How much do I need to work?
Did the math.

284
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,290
It was my life from about that time
I started working at, like I said,

285
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,340
I worked at target as a kid.

286
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:18,570
I worked at target from the time I was
15 and a half and got a work permit from

287
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:22,620
school to the time that I
got my commission in the
Marine Corps and I went to

288
00:18:22,621 --> 00:18:25,380
school and cal state Fullerton
Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

289
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,030
My mom was a guidance
counselor and a teacher,

290
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:30,540
so she helped me build a schedule that
I could graduate as fast as possible,

291
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,060
which is exactly in four years.
It was all day Monday,

292
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:37,650
all day Wednesday and half a day Friday,
and I worked Tuesday, Thursday, Friday,

293
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,800
Saturday, Sunday. The money I paid,
I got paid. I went to my tuition,

294
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,660
my tuition went to my education,

295
00:18:42,661 --> 00:18:46,260
my education got me a commission in the
Marine Corps. I mean, that was kind of it.

296
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:47,430
I mean in some ways you look back,

297
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:48,990
I'm probably could have
diversified a little bit,

298
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,920
but at the time I wasn't unhappy.
I was, I was stoked, man.

299
00:18:52,921 --> 00:18:55,260
I was exactly what I wanted to
be doing. There was no like, man,

300
00:18:55,261 --> 00:18:58,620
I wish I could be doing this. It wasn't
a chore by any stretch. Like I said,

301
00:18:58,621 --> 00:19:01,200
in retrospect, I probably could have
done things a little bit differently.

302
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:03,120
But 17 year old day,
Burke,

303
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:06,450
18 year old Dave Burke knew exactly
what he wanted to do and I had sort of

304
00:19:06,451 --> 00:19:07,860
talked myself into it like,
hey,

305
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:09,810
any detour that's going to
throw you off your path man,

306
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,850
and you're going to look
back with regret and go,

307
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,620
you know why you didn't have been what
you wanted to be because of this or that.

308
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,860
And I wasn't going to let that happen.

309
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:20,910
So I kinda just got a little intense
about being out of the Marine Corps.

310
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,490
And sure enough they did. And you're
still luck involved. Cause when you go to,

311
00:19:23,491 --> 00:19:25,530
when you go to TBS,
which is the basic school,

312
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,260
which is all marine officers go through,
you,

313
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,110
you have to still win or,

314
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,520
or get that bill wanted and you got that.

315
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:38,910
But I mean that could have
gone totally mad sideways.

316
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,730
There's a lot of luck involved.
Um,

317
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,370
I think everybody in the military and
everybody that had been successful in the

318
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:47,010
military knows you looking
back on your career. You know,

319
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:48,800
it's a confluence of a lot of
different things, but timing,

320
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:51,680
circumstance and luck or they're
a part of it without a doubt. You,

321
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,490
nobody can take credit for
everything they've done.

322
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:55,080
And I went back to do it again.

323
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,480
The odds of it working out the
way that it did are pretty slim.

324
00:19:57,481 --> 00:20:01,530
There's just a lot of things that worked
out in my favor. Um, but you know,

325
00:20:01,531 --> 00:20:04,140
I went to ocs,
I went to the Marine Corps recruiter.

326
00:20:04,141 --> 00:20:06,800
I started my freshman year at
cal state Fullerton as a sub.

327
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:10,020
I was 17 when I started college.
Went right to the recruiter on day one,

328
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:12,150
or they call it an Oso and
officer selection officer.

329
00:20:12,151 --> 00:20:14,490
So it's basically a recruiter
for officers. Hey, I want
to be a marine. He's like,

330
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:17,880
right on start filling out this paperwork,
filled out the paperwork. I said,

331
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:20,430
I want to be a Powerade is like piece
of cake. No problem. We can get,

332
00:20:20,431 --> 00:20:22,210
we can make that happen.
Uh,

333
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,750
sign this ground contract and we'll
just make it pilot at some point in the

334
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:28,230
future. For those of you that
don't know, that's a big lie.

335
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,640
A dead easy. It's what he
says, ground chart contract.

336
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:36,840
Of course the Marine Corps needs
pilots and guys to infantry and so,

337
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,870
but they need more infantry then they
need pilots. And so they say, hey,

338
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,910
don't worry about it.
You just sign up for ground right now.

339
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:44,190
We'll take care of that other pilot. You
want to be Pi? Yeah, yeah, of course.

340
00:20:44,191 --> 00:20:46,120
We'll take care of that later.
Yeah, we'll just transition over.

341
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:48,500
It shouldn't be a big deal,
no factor. And at 17, I mean,

342
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,180
I was signing paperwork to be a marine
officer. That was a big step for me and I,

343
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:56,530
and I probably would have signed
anything, uh, happily sign that. Um,

344
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,600
after my freshman year in college,

345
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:02,470
I went to officer candidate
school and to be honest with Ya,

346
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:05,740
and I had all these big grand ideas
for the last two, three years,

347
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:09,130
I knew what I wanted to do,
but I, when I went to ocs,

348
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:11,770
that was the first real hurdle. I mean
everything else you do that or an idea,

349
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,000
a plan, some paperwork I
get to the officer candidate
school and it's like okay,

350
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,730
it was a Royal Marine drill
instructor screaming at you, you know,

351
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:20,290
you're really doing the deed there.

352
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:24,820
And getting through ocs was a big thing
for me because it was the first real

353
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:27,910
test of did I, you know, I knew what I
wanted to do but I had no real sense of,

354
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:32,911
I had what was required to be a marine
and I think as a kid you build up what

355
00:21:33,221 --> 00:21:35,740
that is in your mind.
Is that the larger than life thing?

356
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,020
Like how could anybody possibly do this?

357
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:41,180
You turn it into something more than it
is. When I went to bootcamp, there was a,

358
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,480
there was a navy seal there,
right?

359
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:48,430
And I swear when I saw him I was
like, God, look, now you need huge,

360
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,410
huge,
I mean huge,

361
00:21:50,411 --> 00:21:55,120
big giant forearms and
just a big massive guy.

362
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,350
It just looked like a destroyer of
human life. And I was, oh my God.

363
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,010
So fast forward four years,

364
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:07,120
I'm in the teams and I meet this
guy. And he's not at all, man.

365
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:10,540
He was completely in my head.
It was completely in my head.

366
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:13,960
But this guy was such a destroyer.
But I just thought, hey, he's a seal.

367
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,850
He must be a destroyer. And I
actually saw it that way. Yeah,

368
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,250
you can't help. And it's certainly
at that age, I mean those,

369
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,640
those things are real powerful influences
and wanting to get out to ocs and all

370
00:22:24,641 --> 00:22:28,080
of a sudden you're like, oh man, I
need to, I didn't make this happen. Uh,

371
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:31,540
that was a big, big achievement in my
life that said, hey, I can do this. Okay.

372
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:35,380
I started to realize I'm not the
biggest guy in the marine corps.

373
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,690
Nobody's going to mistake
me for a destroyer. Um,

374
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,640
but what I discovered as I got there,
I knew mentally what I wanted to do.

375
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:45,190
It wasn't a real question mark
about my intentions are my desires.

376
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,650
And I was surrounded by
tough, strong kids. You know,

377
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,290
young kids my age that are trying
to be marine officers. And that's,

378
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,740
that's a physical and a mental challenge.
There's no doubt about it.

379
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,800
And I was seeing guys kind of left and
right of me that looked at least bigger,

380
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:03,310
faster, stronger, tougher and more
capable than they looked like that,

381
00:23:03,311 --> 00:23:04,420
that same image you have in your mind.

382
00:23:04,421 --> 00:23:06,250
And I'm watching these who's
kind of fall out of stuff.

383
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:10,390
We're not finished stuff fast enough.
We're just straight up quit. Um, you know,

384
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:14,170
guys would deal our drop on request at
ocs and I was kind of looking around.

385
00:23:14,171 --> 00:23:18,700
I'm thinking, what's, you know,
what's going on? You know,

386
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:23,230
why are you here if your plan wasn't
to get through it? So that was a good,

387
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,550
a really good thing for me psychologically
to realize that it wasn't just a kind

388
00:23:27,551 --> 00:23:31,390
of a fantasy or a dream I had,
I had the potential being able to do this.

389
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:35,560
So I got through ocs. Um, you know, that's
kind of a painful process as you know,

390
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:37,710
it's 84 days. It can
be, it can be slogging.

391
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,390
You lose a lot of folks doing it for
a whole host of different reasons.

392
00:23:40,391 --> 00:23:43,750
Some people get hurt, some people
quit, some people just can't do it. Uh,

393
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,000
and when you get on the backside of that
and like I can, I can make this happen.

394
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,530
Let's get that air contract.
Well we'll get to that.

395
00:23:49,531 --> 00:23:53,510
Her contract at the basic school,
which is when you get your commission,

396
00:23:53,511 --> 00:23:57,080
you finished school, you get your
degree, finish officer candidate school.

397
00:23:57,081 --> 00:23:59,090
And so basically it says, Hey,
you've done everything you need.

398
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,200
You're a commissioned officer,

399
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:04,070
became a second one 10 in the Marine
Corps in June of 1994 and the first thing

400
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:06,560
you do on active duty as a marine and he
would go to something called the basic

401
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:08,210
school.
I know you've talked about it a few times.

402
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,960
It's basically a school for the Marine
Corp teaches officers a little bit of

403
00:24:11,961 --> 00:24:14,690
everything. It doesn't teach
you everything of anything,

404
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,840
but you get a little exposure
to infantry exposures, tanks,

405
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:19,090
artillery call for fire.

406
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:22,220
It a little exposure to aviation
patrolling defense offense.

407
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:25,790
So you kind of get all the way on the
land and the whole point of that for the

408
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,300
Marine Corps,

409
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,780
you go there with 250 people and they
got to give each one of those people on

410
00:24:29,781 --> 00:24:33,900
assignment, you know, a particular
job and Mos a specialty. Um,

411
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,390
and they rank you,

412
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,480
I mean you are ranked from
one to 250 and for aviation,

413
00:24:40,761 --> 00:24:41,271
when I got there,

414
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,240
I remember getting in the first week
they kind of announced what billets are

415
00:24:44,241 --> 00:24:46,340
going to be a bill available. Oh,
we're going to have, you know,

416
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,360
40 infantry slots and 2010 yeah,

417
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:51,370
they just tell you I kind of
what we expect to have breakdown.

418
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,660
And from there you're supposed to go
back and think about what you want to do.

419
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:59,400
They had to pilot slots. I'm like,
man, that is some rough math. You know,

420
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:02,870
250 folks now, not all tuned to
50 wanted to be a pilot obviously.

421
00:25:02,871 --> 00:25:07,190
And not all 250 people were qualified
with, you know, their eyes and what not.

422
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:09,680
So it wasn't competing with 250 people,

423
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,750
but there was a lot of people
that want to be a pilot.

424
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,970
So the math was certainly not in my favor.

425
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:17,450
And that was another challenge of yeah,
you got to do well.

426
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:20,870
I mean you get ranked and graded
on everything. Physical fitness,

427
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:23,570
your leadership ability or academics,
you get peer reviewed,

428
00:25:23,571 --> 00:25:26,780
you know your peers rate you and you know
anonymously and what they think of you.

429
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:31,670
So you've got basically six months to
get accurate and at the end they line you

430
00:25:31,671 --> 00:25:35,240
up 250 people in a line,
not, this is a real line.

431
00:25:35,241 --> 00:25:39,290
And you walk into a room and on the
room there's a board and whatever job is

432
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:41,450
available,
you can pick.

433
00:25:41,451 --> 00:25:46,190
Now the Marine Corps does
this thing called quality
spread or they basically cut

434
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,800
the class in third. So
had a 250 folks, you know,

435
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:52,400
80 80 80 or something around there.
The number one guy ethics.

436
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:56,240
Then the number 81 guy picks and then the
number 161 guy picks or whatever it is.

437
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,130
And then the number two guy picks.

438
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:01,970
The only job in the Marine Corps that
they did not quality spread was at the

439
00:26:01,971 --> 00:26:02,960
basic school was pilot.

440
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,250
So it was going to be the
first two guys out of the gate.

441
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:09,080
They wanted it that we're qualified,
we're going to get it.

442
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,670
And I got the number
two spot. Um, so again,

443
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,340
it was one of those things that I'm,
I,

444
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:20,330
I was starting to in my mind
realized like, Whoa, this,
I can do this. Uh, you know,

445
00:26:20,331 --> 00:26:23,300
I built this thing up or what I
wanted to do. I'm 21 now, you know,

446
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:24,440
22 I think actually,

447
00:26:24,441 --> 00:26:28,790
so it's six years of my life that I've
been sort of singularly dedicated doing

448
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:32,270
this. And so that day where they, my
platoon commander, guy named John Mary,

449
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:35,750
and I'll never forget it,
he was an [inaudible] pilot,
brings me into his office.

450
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,870
It's like, Dave, you're going
to be a pilot. And he goes,

451
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,840
I think you're going to
fly America's airplane.

452
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:45,510
We're gonna fill out the fat and horny. It
was an awesome day, man. And, uh, I won't,

453
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:50,490
I won't ever forget it. And, um, that
was it. You know, I got my ticket.

454
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:54,660
I, when I, when I was selected
for a pilot, I was ranked,

455
00:26:54,661 --> 00:26:59,040
I think number eight and a 250 in my
company. And by the time I graduated,

456
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:02,040
like three weeks later,
I was like 25 out of two 50.

457
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:06,960
So my performance might have declined a
little bit after I had achieved in the

458
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:10,500
theory of no slack,
a little slack in that line.

459
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:14,470
That line was pretty tight
for a lot of years. Got It.

460
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,000
So a little bit of slack there
at the end, but I did finish, uh,

461
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,420
you know it well enough to get that
pilots, which is what I always wanted.

462
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:25,770
It was kind of my dream. And
uh, that was April of 1995.

463
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,610
So I started the basic school in
October of 94 right after I got,

464
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,880
I graduated college in June,

465
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,870
a little delay to get down to Quantico
for the basic school that's six months

466
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:38,640
long. I graduated sometime mid April and
we'll wow about this time in 1995. So,

467
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,050
and then you go to flight school,
you do the rag,

468
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:45,090
do all that stuff to get out to a,

469
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:48,780
and then the first kind of work you were
doing was a, was southern watch, right?

470
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,500
Yeah. So I get through flight
school, like ended up picking fat.

471
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,200
I get stationed at Eltoro.
So I am literally living the dream.

472
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,840
I moved back to my hometown.
Um,

473
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,550
I think I went until like my 10 year
high school reunion and you know,

474
00:28:02,551 --> 00:28:04,320
I had told all my buddies,
you know, we wanted to do,

475
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:08,370
I ran into some people I hadn't seen
in a while. It was, it was good. Um,

476
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,780
and uh, shortly after I got
there, I actually flew the
last flight out of El Toro.

477
00:28:12,781 --> 00:28:15,810
They closed the base and all the marines
moved down to Miramar. So the navy were,

478
00:28:15,811 --> 00:28:19,710
top gun was filmed and all that stuff.
Back in the day the navy left San Diego,

479
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,830
moved back east and the Marine
Corps happily took over that base.

480
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:26,070
And so I moved down to Miramar,
ended up in an fat in squadron,

481
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,920
stationed at Miramar,
flying Hornets off carriers,

482
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:33,660
straight up live in the shool dream.
You are now living at this time.

483
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:38,460
That's, that's, that is exactly
right. I'm living in San Diego. Uh,

484
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,580
I was living in PB off Anna Kappa and
I'm stationed Miramar Flying Hornets and,

485
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,440
and the carrier that I was assigned to,
uh,

486
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,470
my first deployment we did Operation
Southern Watch. So, you know,

487
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,160
I watched Desert Storm
in [inaudible] 91 on TV.

488
00:28:53,161 --> 00:28:55,980
I was in freshman in college and you know,
we hadn't,

489
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:58,170
we hadn't done much in
the military since then,

490
00:28:58,171 --> 00:29:01,890
but we had flown every single
day since the war ended in,

491
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:05,110
I think was it march of 91
every single day since then.

492
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:09,900
And we flew patrols over Iraq to make
sure that the skies were clear and we were

493
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:13,710
enforcing the no fly zone. And here
it was, you know, 10 years later,

494
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:18,800
2000 on a carrier in the Persian
Gulf flying combat operations,

495
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:23,760
uh, over southern Iraq. Did you guys
ever dropping bombs there? I did, yeah.

496
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:25,890
A few of us did, not a ton,
there wasn't a ton going on,

497
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:27,960
but what we would do these
things called response options.

498
00:29:27,961 --> 00:29:29,070
So if that rack is would do something,

499
00:29:29,071 --> 00:29:32,190
I think in my case they set up a
surface air missile south of, uh,

500
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,660
of a line that they
weren't supposed to be.

501
00:29:33,661 --> 00:29:35,970
And we had surveillance and
told us what was out there.

502
00:29:35,971 --> 00:29:37,350
And I launched on a mission,

503
00:29:37,351 --> 00:29:41,060
I'm blew up a Sam site with something
called a j damn at the time was a,

504
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,010
it was a bomb

505
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,390
guided by GPS, which at the time
was this brand new and crazy.

506
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,570
That was crazy technology.

507
00:29:46,571 --> 00:29:48,970
I think we are on the only plans in the
entire carrier that could do it cause we

508
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:53,290
had this thing called a gps
super fancy back then. Um, but,

509
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,830
but at the time jacket, that was
combat. That was, that was it.

510
00:29:56,831 --> 00:29:58,180
There was no other show in town.

511
00:29:58,181 --> 00:30:03,181
And so the night that I dropped a bomb
on a Sam site in Iraq off a carrier and

512
00:30:04,361 --> 00:30:08,800
an f 18 you'd, I could have, you
could have just retired right there.

513
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,920
We're done under to go. Yeah, I was
at, I could've come back to that.

514
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:14,890
It could have phoned me off the ship and
I probably would have died a happy man

515
00:30:14,891 --> 00:30:17,830
at that point. I was like, that's it.
I, I've, I've reached critical mass.

516
00:30:17,831 --> 00:30:21,970
That's all I ever wanted to
do. So it was, um, again,

517
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,370
a lot of it was just things
worked out in my favor,

518
00:30:24,371 --> 00:30:26,850
but I did exactly what I wanted to do.
And that event was,

519
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,930
was kind of at the time,
sort of the pinnacle.

520
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:30,440
That was what I thought I
was going achieve. Yeah.

521
00:30:30,441 --> 00:30:32,410
I mean it's the same thing in
the dry years for the seal teams.

522
00:30:32,411 --> 00:30:37,140
Like if you did some kind of mission, you
are just super stoked. Dude. You know,

523
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,360
we were over in the Persian
Gulf actually same time,

524
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,070
2099, 2000 I was there, I was in
the Persian Gulf and we were doing,

525
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,630
you know, meo operations stop
and smugglers coming out of Iraq.

526
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,380
So we were taken down vessels and getting
control of them. And again, at the time,

527
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,720
super stoked.
Yes.

528
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:58,390
The big mission was taking all these
vessels and you thought it was pretty cool

529
00:30:58,391 --> 00:30:59,770
in a way. It was cool. It was cool,

530
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:04,030
but you just didn't have any anything
to compare it to at all? Yeah.

531
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,970
So then what happened? So I get
back from that deployment, uh,

532
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:09,970
that's the summer,

533
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:15,190
summer of 2000 and shortly after that I
got selected by my commanding officer to

534
00:31:15,191 --> 00:31:16,120
go to top gun.

535
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:20,100
So that was my first exposure to kind
of advancing inside the squadron.

536
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,200
So I was a young guy,
had done almost two years in the squadron,

537
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,160
had been there for a little while and uh,

538
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,530
got some qualifications and grew
and developed in the squadron.

539
00:31:26,531 --> 00:31:30,340
And they pick one or two guys every couple
of years from me squash and to go to

540
00:31:30,341 --> 00:31:32,140
the school.
And the whole point of going there is a,

541
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:34,000
you learn kind of this advanced,
you know,

542
00:31:34,001 --> 00:31:35,560
it's like a master's degree basically in,

543
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:38,860
in being a fighter pilot with the intent
that you can bring that back to the

544
00:31:38,861 --> 00:31:42,190
squadron and be one of the kind of key
trainers are key leaders in the squadron.

545
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:47,110
So I went to top gun uh, early
the next year, a summer of,

546
00:31:47,111 --> 00:31:49,500
actually about a year later,
so summer of 2001, uh,

547
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:53,370
I go to top gun and I came back and
we're just in a work. I was like,

548
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:58,120
when you show up to top gun, just
sort of Reno's, yeah, you feel like,

549
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,720
I mean especially because you were the
big combat vet with the bombs dropped and

550
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:06,721
you feel like you're pretty
much a complete stud and
then you show up at top gun

551
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:11,440
and the instructors just can completely
annihilate. It just furthers.

552
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:12,610
You don't know. It's, it's,

553
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,640
you're learning how dogfight w Mano Imano
against another guy and another plane

554
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:22,960
like stock car racing because the planes
are equal and it's you against the

555
00:32:22,961 --> 00:32:24,790
other guy.
And it was actually cool.

556
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:27,670
You were explaining some of the rules
and how you'd set it up and they have,

557
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,270
you know, in Jujitsu you know, you, you,
you okay. You know, you start standing,

558
00:32:32,271 --> 00:32:33,820
you know, you shake hands,
bump fists, okay, now it's on,

559
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:36,460
well with the top gun they
started a certain distance. They,

560
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:39,800
they go towards each other. At a certain
altitude, certain away from each other.

561
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:44,120
They go, they pass at a thousand feet,
you know, left, left wing, the left wing.

562
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,380
And then once they pass they said, what
do you say? Game on fights on fights,

563
00:32:48,381 --> 00:32:50,480
on fights on, and then boom, now it's go.

564
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,210
So that's how they start
in a neutral position. And,

565
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,160
and of course when you show up there,

566
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:59,960
it's just like Jujitsu and the fact that
it's like a guy that did a little bit

567
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:03,260
of training somewhere and then they show
up at a Jujitsu place and they're going

568
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:07,370
to get totally destroyed. So he shows
up, you show up at this thing and,

569
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:11,660
and you think you're again, big combat
vet, you just get annihilated. Totally.

570
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,870
So yeah, I get the, I had
dropped a bomb that's singular.

571
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,340
I had dropped a bomb and
bomb and I was, I was, yeah,

572
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,710
it was a big deal I'd do that. Dropped a
bomb, you know. And so at the time I was,

573
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,270
I think some of the instructors
had never done that before. Right.

574
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:27,320
Most of them are, like you said, there's
the dryers. It just wasn't a ton going on.

575
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:29,670
You know, how to, a story
here and there. But, um,

576
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,450
I think more than anything in my own
mind, you, you kind of build up. Like,

577
00:33:32,451 --> 00:33:35,390
I got some game here, man.
I'm going to watch this.

578
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:38,360
I'm going to do some good work
here. Uh, and you know, I'd,

579
00:33:38,361 --> 00:33:41,120
I'd done well enough on my squad and then
I was one of the guys that got picked

580
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:44,080
to go to school. So, which is another
little confidence boost. Yeah. It is.

581
00:33:44,081 --> 00:33:48,620
Ego's getting fed, forced fed
maybe. Yeah, a little bit.

582
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:53,300
Um, yeah, you're feeling pretty good about
yourself and so you'd go up there and,

583
00:33:53,301 --> 00:33:57,980
uh, like, like you said, so you know,
you're, you're a student. You know,

584
00:33:57,981 --> 00:34:00,140
you're not going to, you know, you're not
going to be as good as the instructors,

585
00:34:00,141 --> 00:34:03,590
but we, you don't know is that you're not
just going to lose, you're going to get,

586
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,810
you're not just going to
lose or get annihilated.

587
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:06,710
You're not even know what happened.

588
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,080
It's going to be over and you're going
to kind of be flying back and before

589
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:11,390
you're going to land in
and you're not going to be,

590
00:34:11,391 --> 00:34:14,630
have explained what just occurred. I
mean, it occurs in a way that it's so,

591
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,650
it's hard to explain. It's
like you weren't there. Uh,

592
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:22,400
it's really, it's humbling. I mean, Jocko,

593
00:34:22,401 --> 00:34:26,990
we're talking the very first flight on
the very first day, my very first event,

594
00:34:26,991 --> 00:34:31,780
the very first fight of the first flight,
it was over in like 20 seconds.

595
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,190
And the instructor was saying,
okay, let me call it and say,

596
00:34:34,191 --> 00:34:36,590
knock it off when we're done,
we're going to start and set it up again.

597
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,870
And I knew right then, I was totally in
over my head, the very first one. And uh,

598
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,620
it was so, my first flight was,
was so bad that when I landed, um,

599
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:49,430
we're walking back in to you go to
maintenance and you basically go back and

600
00:34:49,431 --> 00:34:51,770
turn the airplane back in
and so they can fix it.

601
00:34:51,771 --> 00:34:54,440
And then what you're supposed to do is
walk across street to the squadron hanger

602
00:34:54,441 --> 00:34:55,730
and talk about it.

603
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,250
And I'm in my gear and you're supposed
to get undressed out of your flight gear

604
00:34:58,251 --> 00:35:02,070
and go and he's like, Hey, don't get
undressed. And uh, I'm like, okay. Right,

605
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,030
right on. He's like, why don't
we just go do that again? Um,

606
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,490
it was bad enough that we didn't
even need to talk about it.

607
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,790
We just need to just hey. And he's
like, hey, why don't you just,

608
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,090
just take a deep breath man.

609
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:16,490
And we went and did that flight without
ever without ever even talking about the

610
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:20,900
first one. Right. Um, so I
kind of knew I was, yeah,

611
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:25,910
I had some work to do. So top gun is, is
really good about not just humbling you,

612
00:35:25,911 --> 00:35:28,550
but obviously it teaches
you a ton. It's, it's a,

613
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:32,000
it's a six at the time it was only
six weeks with the marines because we,

614
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:36,050
we didn't do some of the syllabus at the
Navy did cause we've got it elsewhere

615
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,130
and it's six.
You start with literally

616
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:42,450
just you against another guy won against
one and you end up building up to where

617
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:43,350
it's a,
you know,

618
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:46,650
six to eight of you on the front on the
blue side of the friendly side against,

619
00:35:46,651 --> 00:35:49,560
you know, 15, 20 simulated
adversary. So it's uh,

620
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:54,080
it's a lot in a short period of time and
that idea of being like really bad and

621
00:35:54,081 --> 00:35:57,450
when you start happens over
and over again in the course.

622
00:35:57,451 --> 00:35:59,460
So you get to the one B one phase
and at the end and like, oh,

623
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:02,310
finally I got this one be one thing,
I got this thing wired, I can do this.

624
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,350
I'm like, all right, cool. You're
not going to go to against whatever.

625
00:36:04,351 --> 00:36:08,070
And you just get rolled again and
you're like back to square one.

626
00:36:08,071 --> 00:36:11,950
So it builds you up and breaks you down
and build you a standard military and

627
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,770
you know,
just breaks you down to your pieces.

628
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,920
And then the guys there
that are instructors are so,

629
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:20,340
they're obviously really good. I mean
that part is sort of speaks for itself.

630
00:36:20,341 --> 00:36:21,151
They're really good on the airplane.

631
00:36:21,151 --> 00:36:23,910
But what makes them unique is
that they're exceptional teachers.

632
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,130
So you learn a ton.
So by the time,

633
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:29,520
by the time you finished up gun that
that image in the mirror and you're like,

634
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,850
man, that dude was awesome.
That gets shattered. It's
actually all back together.

635
00:36:32,851 --> 00:36:34,980
By the time you leave as the you leave,
they're like,

636
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,020
you got that patch on your
shoulder and you fly back.

637
00:36:37,021 --> 00:36:40,110
You'd get the patch and the last day
you'd get up in your airplane and fat with

638
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:42,780
my name painted on the side with a top
gun patch and I flew back to Miramar,

639
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,950
see the dream better
dream is getting better,

640
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,660
but there's been enough reminders or like,
uh,

641
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,520
I should probably maybe cool
out a little bit. You know,

642
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,950
you start to just learn that there's
always guys out there that are

643
00:36:55,951 --> 00:36:59,010
significantly better than you and
you keep climbing up the hill.

644
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,080
But finishing top gun as a student,

645
00:37:01,081 --> 00:37:03,760
you feel like you've hit the top
of the mountain. But you realized,

646
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:06,720
cause the guys you've been working with,
there's an awful long way to go.

647
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:09,540
You at least know what you don't know.
That's a great way to put it.

648
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:12,780
You know what you don't know and you're,
there's a lot that you don't know.

649
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,550
And so it kind of dispels
all those feelings. You know,

650
00:37:14,551 --> 00:37:17,770
we went through flight school,
like, wow, I finished flights going,

651
00:37:17,771 --> 00:37:20,900
I gotta fight teens, I've really got
this flying thing nail. And you're,

652
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,940
you're barely functional and an
airplane compared to these other guys.

653
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:28,560
And when you get to a place like top gun
and it's just such a concentration of

654
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:31,680
talent, you, you, it's good
as it feels. You actually,

655
00:37:31,681 --> 00:37:32,760
the thing that you get
the most out of there,

656
00:37:32,761 --> 00:37:37,050
some humility because you just got crushed
for six weeks, crushed, crushed, uh,

657
00:37:37,051 --> 00:37:38,280
and hopefully you learn
something out of it.

658
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:41,010
And you supposed to take that back and,
and teach the guys in your squadron,

659
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,180
all those same lessons.

660
00:37:42,181 --> 00:37:44,910
And so my expectation was I was
going to go back from top gun.

661
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,190
I was gonna spend another two years,

662
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:51,660
18 months in the squadron as a kind of
the senior instructors and then go on to

663
00:37:51,661 --> 00:37:54,600
something else. And then, and I didn't
know exactly what that was at the time,

664
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,970
but as I'm leaving, no joke, my last
day, I remember the guy who asked me, um,

665
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,550
it's actually the same guy that's going
to do my retirement here in a couple

666
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,151
months. And he's like, hey man,

667
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:07,500
have you thought about coming back to
being an instructor top gun after this

668
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:11,340
tour? And your squad comes over? And I
tried to play it cool. Like, oh, it's, Oh,

669
00:38:11,341 --> 00:38:12,630
let me,
let me go home and think about that.

670
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,380
But clearly there wasn't a
lot to think about there.

671
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:19,920
So I left there with kind of an
inclination that I might get asked back.

672
00:38:19,921 --> 00:38:22,530
And I was pretty stoked about that.
And they didn't formalize it,

673
00:38:22,531 --> 00:38:26,900
but he was a senior Ip on the staff,
the senior marine in there as well. Um,

674
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:30,240
a real respected guy in marine aviation.
And he had give me a sit down.

675
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:33,390
So I was hoping that that was gonna
happen. But I also thought I had time.

676
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:38,260
I thought I was, you know, this is 2001
and obviously, you know, six weeks later,

677
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:43,420
a nine 11, uh, hits. And so all that
calculus kinda changed. And very quickly,

678
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,141
my squadron,

679
00:38:44,141 --> 00:38:47,770
which was on this regular cycle of
preparing to go to what was going to be

680
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:51,760
another southern watch deployment, just
like we did, that whole thing had changed.

681
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,770
Um, because, uh,

682
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,480
because of September 11th through what
happens on September 11th for you? Yeah.

683
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:03,540
You were an active in a squadron getting
ready for work in the morning totally.

684
00:39:03,971 --> 00:39:06,250
Whom? I'm station right up
the road here. Uh, you know,

685
00:39:06,251 --> 00:39:09,040
five miles north of here isn't Marine
Corps Air Station Miramar. I'm a mom.

686
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:13,180
My second half of my first tour as
a pilot and [inaudible] squadron,

687
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:17,140
I'd already done that one deployment.
And um, I had a routine down, you know,

688
00:39:17,141 --> 00:39:20,320
I was getting up, I was probably, I guess
it was probably five in the morning.

689
00:39:20,321 --> 00:39:21,270
I'm sitting at the foot of my bed,

690
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:24,400
lacing up my boots like I did every day
to just get in the car and drive into

691
00:39:24,401 --> 00:39:28,700
work and click on the TV. And, you know,
I see say eight o'clock back east or,

692
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:32,050
or around that time and I see what's
going on. And I think, you know,

693
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,240
same story for all of us. Kind of piece
it together very quickly. Like, Hey,

694
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:36,490
this isn't an accident,
this is something's really happening here.

695
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:40,510
You see if the second building and it
very quickly kind of clicks in like this

696
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:45,340
is the real thing. Um, and I knew, I knew
something I knew were going to go to war.

697
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,500
I didn't know what.
I obviously didn't know the details,

698
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:50,170
but I knew things were going to change
really dramatically. As a matter of fact,

699
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:51,640
you know,
my drive to work,

700
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:54,790
which normally would have taken
me 10 minutes or whatever,
15 minutes, something,

701
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,100
some short drive to get up into,
into the base.

702
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,320
It was like three hours to
get on the base. You know,

703
00:39:59,321 --> 00:40:01,060
they're inspecting every vehicle,
you know,

704
00:40:01,061 --> 00:40:04,590
every car getting pulled over or dogs
or you know, the whole nine yards.

705
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,550
Just the security. Uh, it was pretty
chaotic. He was kind of mayhem. And,

706
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:13,540
um, I drive into my squadron and half
of my squadron had already, not half,

707
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:16,000
but a good number of guys had
already been up to Fallon,

708
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,630
which was where we're going to go for
training, the same place the top gun is.

709
00:40:18,631 --> 00:40:20,650
And it was just part of
a normal training cycle.

710
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,690
And my squadron commander at the time,
uh,

711
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,890
an awesome guy called me because he
had gone up there and I was supposed to

712
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,530
bring the, you know, be part of the second
half of that went up there. He's like,

713
00:40:29,531 --> 00:40:31,570
hey man,
you need to go brief.

714
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:35,710
You're going to be the lead of
a four ship of aircraft. Uh,

715
00:40:35,711 --> 00:40:38,470
we don't know all the details yet, but
we're gonna, they're gonna call you,

716
00:40:38,471 --> 00:40:41,280
they're going to find a live ordinance
and you're going to have to fly an

717
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,123
emission, uh, uh,

718
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,250
an air patrol competent or virtual mission
and it up the cap because there were

719
00:40:45,251 --> 00:40:49,000
still a bunch of airliners that we're
still airborne coming in from places like

720
00:40:49,001 --> 00:40:52,360
Japan and Korea, these long haul,
you know, 12, 13, 14 hour flights.

721
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,380
There's a whole bunch of airplanes
airborne. And we didn't know if those,

722
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,510
there's potential issue with
those airplanes, you know,

723
00:40:58,511 --> 00:40:59,970
if they're going to try to
do the same thing back east.

724
00:40:59,971 --> 00:41:02,630
So they did out west total chaos and,

725
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,500
and I had just recently graduated from
top gun, so I was, he'd say, okay,

726
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:07,630
you're the lead. And, and
we didn't have a good,

727
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,830
we didn't know what the mission was.
I mean,

728
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:12,670
it was basically one of those things
where we're supposed to get airborne and

729
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:14,740
somehow between us and
some other controller,

730
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:17,380
we're going to kind of determine
if a particular aircraft
might've been a threat.

731
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,530
And that was happening all over the
country. People were in their aircraft,

732
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,090
air force, Navy, Marine pilots.

733
00:41:22,091 --> 00:41:26,020
We're just launching to do
these protection missions
of what ends up becoming

734
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,340
something called a Operation Noble Eagle,
which started on September 11th.

735
00:41:30,341 --> 00:41:35,120
And it was this aviation, Overwatch
of, of cities and, and key locations.

736
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:38,900
And we were totally clueless on what
that was. Now, I ended up not launching.

737
00:41:38,901 --> 00:41:42,830
That didn't happen. Um, you know, but we
did the brief, we're getting ready to go.

738
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,210
And, uh, it was just kind of that moment
of chaos of we're on our heels and

739
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,120
talking didn't prepare me for that.

740
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:53,600
I didn't have a sense of what I'm
supposed to do with an airliner, you know,

741
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:57,320
filled with civilians on some route
coming from Japan and trying to figure out

742
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,930
what I would do if somebody
said, hey, that aircraft,

743
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:03,080
we figured out that aircraft is going
to try and fly into a building or,

744
00:42:03,081 --> 00:42:05,510
or crash into an airport or
something like that. It was just,

745
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,860
you're just kind of mayhem
and, and it was, uh, you know,

746
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:13,870
it's tough to start off the idea being
that if that is suspected of happening or

747
00:42:14,391 --> 00:42:16,190
they can somehow confronted,
that's going to happen,

748
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:21,350
then you or one of your mates is
going to have to shoot down a civilian

749
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,510
aircraft. That's what your
being, that's what they're,

750
00:42:23,511 --> 00:42:25,640
that's what they're
thinking. Yeah, exactly. And,

751
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:28,730
and that was something I'd
never considered. Um, you know,

752
00:42:28,731 --> 00:42:31,700
there's anybody you'd consider it at
that point. And I've read, there's some,

753
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:35,450
you know, there's some
pilots that actually ended up
launching in the east coast.

754
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:38,030
I've read a couple articles of pilots
that took off from there f six sixteens

755
00:42:38,031 --> 00:42:41,390
here in DC because obviously
it was with the Pentagon, uh,

756
00:42:41,391 --> 00:42:45,080
up in DC and the New York City that
actually did get airborne and they had

757
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,730
missions to do exactly that.
Um,

758
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:50,330
so in some sense I was pretty lucky
that I didn't have to go through that

759
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:50,841
calculus,

760
00:42:50,841 --> 00:42:53,330
but I still can picture where I'm
sitting given that brief with three other

761
00:42:53,331 --> 00:42:58,090
pilots, Kinda like we're sitting today and
we're even asking ourselves like, well,

762
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,980
how do you, I mean, how do you shoot
down an airliner? You know, what,

763
00:43:01,981 --> 00:43:05,540
what would we actually go through to do
that? How would we determine, you know,

764
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,520
when we were kind of trying
to talk through that and,

765
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:12,550
and the idea that an airliner filled
with civilians and we knew at that point

766
00:43:12,771 --> 00:43:15,620
that those other airliners are versus
regular commercial airplanes that just

767
00:43:15,621 --> 00:43:17,270
took off to go on their
flight and they had crashed.

768
00:43:17,271 --> 00:43:20,120
When you have everybody on board, you
know, nobody's gonna survive that.

769
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:23,300
And so it was just a very
strange way to start.

770
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:25,700
What ended up being kind of
a cycle of war that you know,

771
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:29,540
we've all been through for years now on
that morning of getting that call from

772
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:33,160
the CEO, Hey, this is what you're doing.
And you know, that was the beginning, um,

773
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,320
shortly, very shortly after
that. Within a day or two, no,

774
00:43:36,321 --> 00:43:39,200
actually I think probably that late
afternoon and certainly by the next day my

775
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:43,340
squadron was one of the several squashes
that was tasked to go back out on the

776
00:43:43,341 --> 00:43:46,340
carrier. So we split that squash and
a half, that same CEO that called me,

777
00:43:46,341 --> 00:43:47,450
he took guys from Fallon,

778
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:52,370
flew onto the ship onto the carrier
right off the coast of lax. Uh,

779
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:55,460
and I still, we, we talked about
this I can picture to this day.

780
00:43:55,461 --> 00:43:57,980
I took off out of San Diego
and it's flying overhead,

781
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,690
Los Angeles International Airport.

782
00:43:59,691 --> 00:44:01,340
And we had guys that taken
off from the carrier.

783
00:44:01,341 --> 00:44:05,070
They had live missiles and they were
doing a cap and I'm flying, you know,

784
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,810
kind of opposite direction overhead,
lax looking down. And you know,

785
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:09,800
I grew up in southern California.

786
00:44:09,801 --> 00:44:11,720
Lex is like one of the
busiest airports in the world.

787
00:44:11,721 --> 00:44:15,410
There's planes all over the tarmac on the
runways and the taxiways cause there's

788
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,000
everybody landed,
nobody took off,

789
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:20,120
there's no controllers and they're
doing this cat mission when they're just

790
00:44:20,121 --> 00:44:23,900
flying overhead. Lax kind of
largely unknown of what's going on.

791
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:28,040
And just that moment of seriality of
them airborne and there's nobody else,

792
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:32,310
nobody else flying. And we're just sort
of just waiting for something to happen.

793
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:34,530
And you know, it was kind of one
of those, hey, you'll get your,

794
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:38,040
you'll get more specific instructions
as we figure it out. You know,

795
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:38,850
the leadership was,

796
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:41,640
was scrambled every bit as much as we
were and kind of looking down thinking

797
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:46,350
this is, this is a whole new world.
You know, this is not southern watch.

798
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,560
You know that that mission
we've been doing. And within

799
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:54,080
maybe six weeks, we steamed out, we take,

800
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:57,530
we loaded the carrier a
couple months early, put the
squadron, the whole airwing,

801
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:02,550
got on board the carrier and steamed out
towards the north Arabian Gulf to go do

802
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,020
what we call it as Operation
Enduring Freedom. So late 2001,

803
00:45:07,021 --> 00:45:11,180
I think it was maybe November of
2001, we were going to war. Uh,

804
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:15,120
and Afghanistan was where the war was.
You remember at the time that was it.

805
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:17,310
There was nothing else going on.
And we went to Afghanistan.

806
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:21,310
So I did a seven month
cruise on a carrier, um,

807
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:25,620
from November of 2001 I
think we came back April,

808
00:45:25,621 --> 00:45:27,780
may of 2002,
uh,

809
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,590
and did combat operations over
Afghanistan and you know, you know,

810
00:45:31,591 --> 00:45:32,910
a lot more ordinance and a lot busier.

811
00:45:32,911 --> 00:45:35,490
We did a mission at the time
was called Operation Anaconda.

812
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,750
Thinking about Ashley about that,

813
00:45:36,751 --> 00:45:40,380
that was like the largest ground offensive
we had supported since Desert Storm.

814
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:44,610
Um, and when we came back in
April, April or May of [inaudible],

815
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,840
we thought we would sort
of largely won the war.

816
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:52,320
We thought we'd accomplished most of
our mission. We left thinking, Hey,

817
00:45:52,321 --> 00:45:54,390
this thing is winding down.
We're feeling pretty good about it.

818
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,490
And when I got back in May of o two,

819
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:00,510
I kind of distinctly remember like I
just had my war experience, you know,

820
00:46:00,511 --> 00:46:03,510
as a pilot in combat. And, you know,
I'd done Southern Watch, but obviously,

821
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:04,980
you know, nothing like this. And, but I'd,

822
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:08,940
I'd done a combat deployment off a
carrier supported troops on the ground in

823
00:46:08,941 --> 00:46:12,720
Afghanistan, dropping bombs and fallen
off cares. I, I of thought that was it.

824
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,980
I think a lot of us did,
a lot of us did. I know,

825
00:46:16,981 --> 00:46:19,800
I thought that might come back from my
first deployment to Iraq. I was kind of,

826
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:24,570
you know, I'm thankful that I got
to do this deployment and a thought,

827
00:46:24,571 --> 00:46:26,160
they can't go on that much longer.

828
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:30,150
But I mean really quickly after we got
back at it spiraled and I said, oh,

829
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:34,650
this is going to be awhile.
Yeah. Big Time. Um, you know,

830
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:39,540
while I was on that deployment, I had
got an email from top gun saying, hey,

831
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:41,520
why don't you come up here next summer?
I mean instructor.

832
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,770
So I came back in May of that deployment
knowing that my next step was going to

833
00:46:46,771 --> 00:46:50,280
go back up to Fallon.
So I was feeling pretty good about that.

834
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:55,170
I was pretty pumped to know what
was next and um, you know, in that,

835
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:58,070
that period of time we came back,
you know, I'm packing up that summer,

836
00:46:58,110 --> 00:46:58,580
moving out in the,

837
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:03,060
in the fall and already the gears are
starting to turn a for what ended up being

838
00:47:03,061 --> 00:47:05,100
our operation Iraqi
Freedom. You know, it's,

839
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:07,320
the writing is on the wall that this is,
we're not done.

840
00:47:07,321 --> 00:47:10,500
I mean we're really just getting started
and it was several months before that

841
00:47:10,501 --> 00:47:11,011
all kicked off.

842
00:47:11,011 --> 00:47:14,550
I think everybody in the
military certainly knew this
is which way it's going to

843
00:47:14,551 --> 00:47:15,360
happen.

844
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,090
And I think there was some things along
the way that we're supposed to occur,

845
00:47:18,091 --> 00:47:20,790
but we all knew this was
coming. Certainly, you know,

846
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:22,800
when it kicked off in March
of the following year,

847
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,810
it wasn't a big surprise to any of us.

848
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,140
And I was up at Fallon kind of
watching that whole thing roll.

849
00:47:28,141 --> 00:47:31,750
And I realized that that deployment and
I just finished, it was not the end of,

850
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:35,110
you know, what, what we're
doing as a country and tried
to deal with this problem.

851
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:39,570
And, and then you show up at top gun to
be an instructor, which is, you know,

852
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:43,510
you said the going to top gun was
like a masters. And so now it's,

853
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:48,040
it's beyond a doctorate, right? I
mean it's, yeah, we say it's the Phd.

854
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:52,150
I mean in our business, um,
yeah, certainly is a for a
marine or a naval aviator,

855
00:47:52,151 --> 00:47:55,780
a fighter pilot, that's, that's
it. Top gun kind of represents,

856
00:47:55,781 --> 00:47:58,240
that's the school house.
It's the place where you want to be.

857
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,510
And as an instructor you have a,
you have a huge amount of responsibility.

858
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:05,440
It's a bunch of sort of mid, mid career
guys. It's, it's navy lieutenant,

859
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:09,040
it's marine corps captains, maybe a junior
major, a junior lieutenant commander.

860
00:48:09,041 --> 00:48:13,180
But it's run by um,
relatively young guys,

861
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:15,520
guys that have maybe a full deployment
under the belt. And you know,

862
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:18,220
quickly guys were coming in and having
done Afghanistan combat operations,

863
00:48:18,221 --> 00:48:21,070
guys coming haven't gotten
out of Iraq combat operations.

864
00:48:21,071 --> 00:48:25,720
So in the time that I was there from o
to o five the combat experience on the

865
00:48:25,721 --> 00:48:29,650
staff went from basically
none to everybody.

866
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,560
Every single dude had been in combat.

867
00:48:31,561 --> 00:48:35,140
It was coming off a long deployment where
they had done back to back deployments,

868
00:48:35,141 --> 00:48:39,130
Iraq and Afghanistan guys that I knew had
done 10 month deployments to Iraq on a

869
00:48:39,131 --> 00:48:44,020
carrier. I mean really seasoned guys were
just one generation three years prior.

870
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:48,220
Not a single person on the staff
had seen any combat like that.

871
00:48:48,221 --> 00:48:49,960
So exact same thing in the seal teams.

872
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,960
We experienced exact same thing and
went from zero or close to zero combat

873
00:48:55,151 --> 00:48:58,770
experiences that it's an odd guy
that had done little operation here,

874
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:02,680
there to every single guy except
for the new guys, you know,

875
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,150
and then but but your, your learning
curve and when you show back up there,

876
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:10,210
it was just a steep as the first
time. Yeah, without a doubt.

877
00:49:10,211 --> 00:49:14,980
So when you're there as a student and you
don't understand a lot of what's going

878
00:49:14,981 --> 00:49:17,080
on as a student, at least on
the instructor side, you know,

879
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:19,450
they're not trying to keep
anything from me, but you're just,

880
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:22,030
you were so busy just trying
to keep your head above water.

881
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:24,100
You're not spending a lot
of time wondering what the
instructors are doing in

882
00:49:24,101 --> 00:49:28,180
their free time. Um, you know,
you're just prepping for every brief.

883
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,640
The flight may take an hour,

884
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:33,850
but you put in 10 hours of work ahead of
time and you debrief for six hours and

885
00:49:33,851 --> 00:49:37,360
when you're done you need to go start
the next prep process again for you.

886
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,520
So you are just all day,

887
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:43,900
every day thinking about your next
flight and getting ready for that and the

888
00:49:43,901 --> 00:49:44,441
things going on.

889
00:49:44,441 --> 00:49:47,680
So in your learning curve is steep
as a student when you get there.

890
00:49:47,681 --> 00:49:49,930
As an instructor,
and I didn't know this at the time,

891
00:49:49,931 --> 00:49:52,150
you get there when you're
there as an instructor,

892
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:56,620
you have certainly been selected
to a pretty elite group of folks.

893
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:01,600
But you don't teach the student at Tompkin
when you're an instructor. For a year.

894
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,750
They spend an entire year
with you as an instructor.

895
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:06,430
There's only 25 guys on the staff.

896
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,980
And so a third of you basically
if you kind of do the math,

897
00:50:08,981 --> 00:50:11,800
are sequestered for an entire year
just going through what's called,

898
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:14,140
we call it the Iut,
the instructor under training,

899
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:17,770
and they're just teaching you
how to teach students. Um,

900
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:22,540
and in that year you're now flying all
these different training missions with

901
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:26,110
the instructors that are training you
to be an instructor and you're getting

902
00:50:26,111 --> 00:50:30,740
annihilated again. So that whole
continuum of, wow, I'm pretty good.

903
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:34,250
Uh, you were reminded very quickly
and so it takes an entire year. Now,

904
00:50:34,251 --> 00:50:35,410
the good news about that is it,

905
00:50:35,411 --> 00:50:38,180
by the time you're finishing your
initial instructor qualification,

906
00:50:38,181 --> 00:50:39,560
you can go teach students.

907
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:44,180
You have been flying more than you've
ever flown in your entire career. I mean,

908
00:50:44,181 --> 00:50:47,360
I'm fine two, three times a
day, sometimes for a year.

909
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:52,310
And so you're just getting reps and reps
and reps and you have God more reps,

910
00:50:52,311 --> 00:50:55,310
I think anybody in aviation. So when
the time you get your first student,

911
00:50:55,311 --> 00:50:59,390
you sit down, your very first student
brief, your a game has been elevated,

912
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:04,460
you know quite a bit and you're able to
fly with the students and teach them way

913
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:07,910
more effectively. Because when I
finished top gun, I went to Afghanistan,

914
00:51:07,911 --> 00:51:11,630
I didn't do a single air to air mission
for almost a year. I was dropping bombs,

915
00:51:11,631 --> 00:51:14,150
I was doing cast and all
those other types of missions.

916
00:51:14,151 --> 00:51:18,350
So when I got there I was,
I was pretty rusty on those skillsets.

917
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,140
A year of flying with instructors will,
we'll resolve that.

918
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:26,620
Just it just the amount of flying
that you get, you know, introducing,

919
00:51:26,621 --> 00:51:29,690
we call Matt time, but,
but for a normal pilot,

920
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:33,710
you're not even getting a fraction of
that, right? A fraction. Yeah. Not only,

921
00:51:33,711 --> 00:51:35,060
you're not getting a fraction of it.

922
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:40,120
A lot of the time that you're flying is
when you're not at top gun is, you know,

923
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:42,830
sometimes you do an admin flying
just fine tune from different places.

924
00:51:42,831 --> 00:51:45,680
Sometimes you're just prepping for
a very particular mission. You know,

925
00:51:45,681 --> 00:51:47,570
it takes a skill to,
you know,

926
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:50,660
the mission is getting ready to drop bombs
or do arm reconnaissance or different

927
00:51:50,661 --> 00:51:53,810
types of flying.
You don't get to see all of it.

928
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,910
You get to see a pretty
narrow amount at top gun.

929
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:58,580
You get exposed to everything repeatedly.

930
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:02,270
And so that one against one that we
talked about that we call a BFM basic

931
00:52:02,271 --> 00:52:05,390
fighter maneuvers, which is just you
and another guy fighting two airplanes.

932
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:07,730
You do that a ton,
but you,

933
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:12,880
you do all the other things just as
much so you get exposed to the phd.

934
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:16,580
Part of it isn't just the Reps.
I think that's critical,

935
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:20,840
but it's that you get exposed to this
nuance part of aviation that you just

936
00:52:20,841 --> 00:52:24,740
didn't even really know existed. So you,
you get all the science, all the math,

937
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:28,370
all the things that drive us to say this
is why we do the things we do and just

938
00:52:28,371 --> 00:52:32,660
get to practice it over and over. And then
you go back to the science and go, Hey,

939
00:52:32,661 --> 00:52:34,670
I think there's some flaws here
and maybe some differences here.

940
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:37,130
And the guys at top and into
the one writing the manual,

941
00:52:37,131 --> 00:52:38,820
we literally write a manual,

942
00:52:38,821 --> 00:52:43,190
it's four inches thick of all these
different chapters of how to fly the

943
00:52:43,191 --> 00:52:43,550
airplane.

944
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:46,130
Everything from doing a one against
wanting to dropping a bomb to mission

945
00:52:46,131 --> 00:52:47,660
planning.
Top Gun owns that.

946
00:52:47,661 --> 00:52:52,070
And so I was given a chapter in a book
and a lecture that I was responsible for

947
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:55,430
and that the thing that was pretty
amazing for me is when I got there,

948
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,120
the mission set,
that I was responsible for my area,

949
00:52:59,121 --> 00:53:02,240
my subject matter expert area was
surface air threaten counter tactics.

950
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:06,350
So I was the guy as a captain in the
Marine Corps that was responsible for

951
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:07,250
writing the chapter,

952
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,300
teaching the lecture and establishing
our tactics for how to defeat threat

953
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:12,890
surface air missiles and AAA.

954
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,760
And this was from September of 2002 to
march of 2003 that I was the guy that

955
00:53:21,591 --> 00:53:24,650
established the Navy
Marine Corps procedures and
techniques and how we did that

956
00:53:24,651 --> 00:53:29,190
and taught that. So, you know, desert or
I'm sorry, oh I have kicks off, you know,

957
00:53:29,191 --> 00:53:33,000
guys that I'm with had formed with and
train with, are out there on deployments,

958
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:36,240
are writing me letters. Hey, we're seeing
this threat. What should we do here?

959
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,300
You know, buddies of mine
that I, I've been grown up
in aviation. I'm saying, Hey,

960
00:53:39,301 --> 00:53:41,850
this is what we should do. This is how
you should deal with this particular case.

961
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,460
And so their responsibility as an Ip,

962
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:48,720
I think why it's such a phd type program
is that your level responsibility grows.

963
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,940
You have to be more than
just a good pilot. I mean,

964
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:52,290
you can teach anybody to be a good pilot,

965
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,650
but if you can't teach and explain other
guys what they're doing and how to get

966
00:53:55,651 --> 00:53:58,290
better and how to keep themselves alive,
you're kind of useless in combat.

967
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:03,510
So it was a, it was, it was the
best three years of my life, man.

968
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:08,400
It was, it was ridiculous. And we just
flew every day, two or three times a day.

969
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:11,580
I got qualified in the of 16 I got
to fly totally different airplane.

970
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:16,610
So I was dual qualled in [inaudible]
16 as a marine on a navy base at a navy

971
00:54:16,801 --> 00:54:21,600
command after having done two deployments
on carriers. I mean, you cannot,

972
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,660
it'd be like if I said, Jackie, I
need you to do Jujitsu three day,

973
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,900
three times a day, every day
for three years, and you need,

974
00:54:27,901 --> 00:54:30,450
and that's all I need you to do. I don't
need you to do anything else. Yeah, yeah.

975
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:34,890
You know, it's, I've actually done a
backseat ride and [inaudible] at Fallon,

976
00:54:34,891 --> 00:54:35,700
as a matter of fact.

977
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,250
And one of the things that I
think is important to understand,

978
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:39,840
at least from my perspective,

979
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:43,860
one of the things that made it really
cool was when you get an f 18 if you've

980
00:54:43,861 --> 00:54:45,180
never been in one,
most people,

981
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,760
you're not gonna get the chance to
get an Fha and fly with it. Right.

982
00:54:47,761 --> 00:54:49,590
So I'll give a little description
of what I thought it was.

983
00:54:49,591 --> 00:54:53,680
One of the coolest parts about it is that
if you look at the structure of an fat

984
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,290
tha the,

985
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,940
the pod that you sit in the cockpit is
really far forward and the wings and the

986
00:54:59,941 --> 00:55:03,540
engines are stuff are behind you and
it looks that way when you look at it.

987
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:06,480
But when you get in it you,
those,

988
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:11,540
those wings are so far behind you that
you feel like you're in a superhero pot.

989
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:15,060
You need to turn,
you need to turn hard.

990
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:19,650
You can't just look back to see the wings
and it's a glass canopy that surrounds

991
00:55:19,651 --> 00:55:24,651
you so you feel like you're just in a
little pod that is moving at whatever,

992
00:55:25,201 --> 00:55:29,640
800 miles an hour and it's,
it's a, it's a crazy feeling.

993
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:31,810
It's a crazy feeling
and you can cause your,

994
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,510
it's deceiving because you just feel
like you're in this little space pod

995
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:39,330
somehow.
Star wars powering through the year,

996
00:55:39,331 --> 00:55:41,270
you don't realize that behind you is,
you know,

997
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:46,280
tons of metal and machinery that's making
this happen and the g forces and all

998
00:55:46,771 --> 00:55:51,510
that stuff. It's a, it's, it's, it's a
very cool, very cool thing to experience.

999
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:55,380
For me, I thought, oh yeah, that was
awesome. I didn't think to myself, man,

1000
00:55:55,381 --> 00:55:58,530
I should have been a pilot. I there's
some, there's some, I know you,

1001
00:55:58,531 --> 00:56:01,500
we were talking about it yesterday.
For you,

1002
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:06,060
the connection between man and machine
is a really cool thing that you enjoy.

1003
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:10,990
For me, I don't like it. I don't
like to rely on a machine. Yeah.

1004
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:14,520
I don't even, even getting in Bradleys
and stuff and Ramadi and always think, ah,

1005
00:56:14,521 --> 00:56:14,821
you know,

1006
00:56:14,821 --> 00:56:18,000
I mean I always was apprehensive about
a big machine that I had to rely on.

1007
00:56:18,001 --> 00:56:22,680
I'd want to rely on me and what I could
do and that's why I had that little

1008
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:25,780
disconnect. I'll always, I
still have it today, you know,

1009
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,510
that's why I'm waiting for the robot
war cause I want, I'm on a fight,

1010
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:33,220
those things. So I just have a
little disconnect with the machines.

1011
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,990
But I can see where people that are,
have that type of mindset.

1012
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:40,590
It's just, you know, it's
just a complete equalizers.

1013
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:43,960
You were telling me last night,
you just like is it's a stock car race.

1014
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:48,990
It's you in the same plane as me
and who is better is going to win,

1015
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:53,920
period. That's it. There's really
no excuses you can make. Yeah,

1016
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:55,850
that's one of my favorite
things is always been to,

1017
00:56:55,851 --> 00:56:59,080
one of my favorite things about flying
fighters is that it's, it's an equalizer.

1018
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:04,030
You don't get, you don't bring any
advantage to that airplane. Now,

1019
00:57:04,031 --> 00:57:06,790
if we're going to train something, you
and me, there's guys that are bigger,

1020
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:09,100
the guys that are better heart rate,
they got whatever.

1021
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:13,580
There's a whole bunch of ways that
maybe you can bring an advantage. Uh,

1022
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,400
you lose all that.

1023
00:57:15,401 --> 00:57:17,740
They've been you strap on that airplane
because you're only going to go as fast

1024
00:57:17,741 --> 00:57:20,290
as the airplane goes. You don't want to
pull as many Jesus the airplane Poles.

1025
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:24,310
That's what you get now. You get a lot
of all that stuff. I mean it's awesome,

1026
00:57:24,311 --> 00:57:29,311
but your success or your failure is 100%
about how well you interact with that

1027
00:57:30,131 --> 00:57:34,390
machine and compared to that other guy and
if you lose, you're not. Wow. My engine.

1028
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:36,550
No. Well, I didn't have negative.

1029
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:39,220
You lost because you were
worse than me today period.

1030
00:57:39,221 --> 00:57:41,710
And and like you're going to, we're
going to find reasons why, you know,

1031
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:46,390
we record every flight, we record our
radars, we record our information,

1032
00:57:46,391 --> 00:57:50,170
our display so we can go back and dissect
and what you end up being able to do

1033
00:57:50,171 --> 00:57:54,730
as an instructor is right there. That's
why you lost this decision you made here.

1034
00:57:54,731 --> 00:57:55,511
This move.
You went,

1035
00:57:55,511 --> 00:57:58,180
you went this direction or we went up
or down and you decided to go at this

1036
00:57:58,181 --> 00:57:58,930
speed or whatnot.

1037
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:03,910
You can dissect every single flight and
the great instructors are the ones that

1038
00:58:03,911 --> 00:58:04,744
can tell you,

1039
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:09,820
this is why I did this to
you in 45 seconds because
here you made a decision and

1040
00:58:09,821 --> 00:58:11,590
it took me this long to capitalize it.

1041
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:15,820
But right now is where I took advantage
of a mistake that you made and you

1042
00:58:15,821 --> 00:58:17,510
freeze that may say,
can you put on a TV?

1043
00:58:17,511 --> 00:58:20,730
And they see it and they look at it and
that Burns into their brain and then

1044
00:58:20,731 --> 00:58:24,190
make that mistake over and over and over
again until eventually they don't make

1045
00:58:24,191 --> 00:58:26,560
that mistake. And then you start to
make your money as an instructor.

1046
00:58:26,561 --> 00:58:28,840
But being in an airplane,

1047
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:34,840
I brought every bit of capability that
airplane had and I'd never had it.

1048
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:38,830
There's no deal. You don't
start at a disadvantage. Um,
and if you beat somebody,

1049
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:41,200
they have nobody to look at.
No excuse,

1050
00:58:41,201 --> 00:58:43,570
no nothing to blame except
for their own performance.

1051
00:58:43,571 --> 00:58:47,950
And I loved that and I will always
love that about being a fighter pilot.

1052
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:51,880
Um, and then when you're finding enough
16, now you have a different air points.

1053
00:58:51,881 --> 00:58:55,600
So hey, wonder points faster than the
other one. Airplane actually turns better.

1054
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:59,230
And so now instead of it just
being two totally equal platforms,

1055
00:58:59,231 --> 00:59:02,140
it's one has particular strengths or
weaknesses that are different than the

1056
00:59:02,141 --> 00:59:02,920
other ones.

1057
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:06,220
So you better be really good
about avoiding his strengths
and getting, you know,

1058
00:59:06,221 --> 00:59:10,420
and plan to his weaknesses and vice
versa. And if you lose, guess what?

1059
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,040
It's still your fault.

1060
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:16,240
100% because instead of you
having two similar airplanes,

1061
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:20,230
you couldn't identify what he was able
to do better than you and his regime that

1062
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,520
he has. You know, you're stronger
than me. Fine then I'm going to do,

1063
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:25,250
I'm going to try to be more agile than
you. Uh, you know, you're quicker than me.

1064
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,870
Okay, well I'm going to
maybe try to outpower you.

1065
00:59:26,871 --> 00:59:31,430
Those type of things and those games that
you play kind of back and forth, you,

1066
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:34,550
there is no question at the end of a
flight at top gun that you're fighting

1067
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:37,730
another dude who won. Nobody comes back.
Like, I wonder how I did on that one.

1068
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,820
It's all very evident if you're looking
over your shoulder and the guy is

1069
00:59:40,821 --> 00:59:42,710
telling me that he's gunning
you with his airplane,

1070
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,110
you don't go back to the debrief
and think, I wonder how that,

1071
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:49,040
I wonder how this is going to play out.
So it's all right there laid out.

1072
00:59:49,041 --> 00:59:51,680
The cars are always on the table.
There's a reason for everything.

1073
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,060
Why you succeeded in why you failed.

1074
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:57,800
And I just thrived in that environment
because you couldn't hide from anything.

1075
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:02,030
Everybody saw everything. It was all right
there. Who good student, a really good,

1076
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:07,031
talented student coming up to top gun
has what percentage chance of winning.

1077
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:10,400
So if, if the best,
let's say hypothetically,

1078
01:00:10,401 --> 01:00:14,540
the best student that I ever saw that
came to talk and as a student from a

1079
01:00:14,541 --> 01:00:15,140
squadron,

1080
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:19,950
the best student that ever came to top
gun to fight a qualified TACO instructor

1081
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,430
stands at 0% chance of winning.

1082
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:27,050
The best student at top
gun has zero chance.

1083
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:31,180
I could fall asleep in an airplane as
an Ip and a student is not going to beat

1084
01:00:31,181 --> 01:00:35,090
me. There is just such a huge, and it
doesn't even mean that we're better.

1085
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:38,980
I don't mean to imply that we were better
pilots, but you just, you at time. Yep.

1086
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:42,410
It's just time. You are just,
it's not, it's, and it's,

1087
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:45,020
and I don't even mean that critical.
It's just not even close.

1088
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:48,660
And nor would they expect it, you
know? I mean, some students may,

1089
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:50,720
every now and then a student kind of
thinks he's going to do some good work.

1090
01:00:50,721 --> 01:00:52,040
You know, hey, watch this, I'm awesome,

1091
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:55,460
but most guys show up realizing
that that disparity, I, you know,

1092
01:00:55,461 --> 01:00:57,050
I understood that when I
got there as a student,

1093
01:00:57,051 --> 01:00:59,690
like these guys are just in a different
world and that you want to get to that

1094
01:00:59,691 --> 01:01:00,524
world.

1095
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:05,210
But you know as an Ip
you if I's instructor,

1096
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:06,573
instructor pilot,
yeah.

1097
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:10,850
If I flew my best jet on day
one against the best student,

1098
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:16,490
it would be over so fast that he almost
wouldn't even learn as much as he should.

1099
01:01:16,491 --> 01:01:17,324
So you,

1100
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:21,470
you still fly your best airplane but
you make sure that there is a learning

1101
01:01:21,471 --> 01:01:24,040
process there. If you want to just
annihilate somebody at top gun, isn't it?

1102
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:24,893
You can do that.

1103
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:30,560
The students that come there
even on their last day aren't,

1104
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:34,970
aren't on your same level. They just
aren't. They've gotten a lot better.

1105
01:01:34,971 --> 01:01:35,960
The learning curve is steep,

1106
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,600
but when you're in your third
year as an IP at top gun,

1107
01:01:38,601 --> 01:01:42,560
you have just had so many reps, you know
so many laps doing the exact same thing.

1108
01:01:42,561 --> 01:01:46,610
You've seen everything that, it's almost
like we talked about this yesterday.

1109
01:01:46,611 --> 01:01:48,560
It's almost like things are
happening in slow motion for you,

1110
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:51,230
like you're in the Matrix and that guy
is just working as hard as he possibly

1111
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:55,130
can and doing his thing and you're just
kinda sitting there kind of watching it

1112
01:01:55,131 --> 01:01:56,570
at like one third speed.

1113
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:59,980
So your ability to decide and do something
to him or something to that airport

1114
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:00,823
or make a decision,

1115
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:05,360
you're just operating at a faster pace
than him and that reaction is just

1116
01:02:05,361 --> 01:02:06,320
impossible to keep up with.

1117
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:09,090
I can't wait until you start training
in Jujitsu because you're just going to,

1118
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:14,270
the analogies are just everywhere and
that's one thing I say in Jujitsu.

1119
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:16,730
You can see the future,
you can actually see the future.

1120
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:19,800
When you're training Jujitsu, it's on
someone that doesn't know as much as you,

1121
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:23,670
you know what is going to happen.
You know what they are going to do.

1122
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:27,690
Just like when you're in the cockpit and
you do something and you know what that

1123
01:02:27,691 --> 01:02:30,710
person, you know what they're going to
do. You just know it totally. And in,

1124
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:33,330
don't forget to. As a,
as a, as an instructor,

1125
01:02:33,331 --> 01:02:35,370
you've been on the receiving
end of that for years as well.

1126
01:02:35,371 --> 01:02:38,360
So you understand kind of both
sides of that coin and you know,

1127
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:39,890
you fight with someone and
you'll thank yourself like,

1128
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:43,170
oh I can't believe you just did that.
And then you know,

1129
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:47,040
three turns later is when you get to
take advantage of that because you know,

1130
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:50,310
some time we'll have to play out for his
mistake to really reveal itself. Like,

1131
01:02:50,311 --> 01:02:52,110
man, I can't, I can't
believe you just did that.

1132
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,090
This is going to cost you over time.

1133
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:57,300
And you can go back on the tape
like I said and said, hey, you know,

1134
01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:00,780
you're worried about what happened at
the end, run behind you. But what really,

1135
01:03:00,781 --> 01:03:05,781
what let me do that was 30 seconds
ago you did this and when this was the

1136
01:03:05,851 --> 01:03:09,470
environment or the circumstances and you
see that stuff and that's when you're

1137
01:03:09,471 --> 01:03:12,270
talking about seeing the future. I mean,
if you really want to be a jerk about it,

1138
01:03:12,271 --> 01:03:14,190
you know, if guys are
your buddies, you know,

1139
01:03:14,191 --> 01:03:16,920
I'll get on the radio like a buddy of
mine off the students that came through,

1140
01:03:16,921 --> 01:03:19,590
but you guys are my squash. And I'm like,
oh, that's going to hurt. And I was like,

1141
01:03:19,591 --> 01:03:21,370
what? What am I stand by? You know,

1142
01:03:21,371 --> 01:03:24,210
and 30 seconds later and
you'll be gun and the guy, um,

1143
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:28,710
because you see the mistakes that they
make and you know how that's gonna play

1144
01:03:28,711 --> 01:03:33,060
out. So you are on your own playing
field there as a, as an instructor.

1145
01:03:33,061 --> 01:03:36,090
And like I said, man, it's not
about being better or worse,

1146
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:41,250
it's just the time and you get so much
of the time there and you get exposed to

1147
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:44,310
all the,
the why you get the why at top gun.

1148
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:49,350
We teach the why a lot,
but when you're writing the manual,

1149
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:50,850
when you're doing that and you're,

1150
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,450
you have all the testing equipment
available and you're running a thousand

1151
01:03:54,451 --> 01:03:56,790
computer generated reps to
see what the results are,

1152
01:03:57,210 --> 01:04:01,850
the level of what you know about the why
is just so much more. So you just, you,

1153
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:03,880
there's a whole world
available to you to and,

1154
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:09,030
and the guys at top to want to be there
though the most that the ips are killing

1155
01:04:09,151 --> 01:04:10,380
to get to a place like that.

1156
01:04:10,381 --> 01:04:13,070
So there's not a lot of slackers
they're not allowed to do,

1157
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:16,380
just trying to motivate or kind of prod
along like, hey buddy, let's get going.

1158
01:04:16,381 --> 01:04:20,730
You know, dudes are getting after it from
startup to shut down every single day.

1159
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:22,800
And so you're also getting pulled along
cause you want to keep up with your

1160
01:04:22,801 --> 01:04:27,630
peers. You know, you don't want to be the
worst top gun instructor there. You know,

1161
01:04:27,631 --> 01:04:28,860
every time you think you've made it,

1162
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:32,400
you realize all you did was just getting
a more selective pool and your goal is

1163
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:33,840
the same as to be the
best that you can be.

1164
01:04:33,841 --> 01:04:36,040
And hopefully the best you can be is
one of the best guys there. You know,

1165
01:04:36,041 --> 01:04:39,810
you'd want to be last to top gun cause
then you're just last and I'm going to be

1166
01:04:39,811 --> 01:04:42,450
last in anything who does. And so
that, that's a real kind of a type,

1167
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:46,440
a real aggressive group of dudes and
um, they pull you and, and you, you,

1168
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:49,170
you got to keep up. And
sometimes you know, a couple
of guys here and there don't,

1169
01:04:49,171 --> 01:04:52,470
but for the most part the selection
process works pretty well.

1170
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:56,690
You know what score, just to bring
this back for a second too, you know,

1171
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,340
talking about leadership and
interacting with other people,

1172
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:04,400
this same exact thing happens when you
start to pay attention to the tactics,

1173
01:05:05,671 --> 01:05:08,820
techniques,
procedures of leadership.

1174
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:12,150
You start to see the moves that
people are making. You know,

1175
01:05:12,151 --> 01:05:15,510
you start to see the moves that your
subordinate is making because his ego's

1176
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:18,210
flaring up or because he's getting,
um,

1177
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:21,820
taking too much ownership of something
that he doesn't want to let go and he's

1178
01:05:21,821 --> 01:05:23,380
getting emotional about it.
Or do you start seeing,

1179
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:28,120
you start seeing the same type
of things at one third speed.

1180
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:31,210
And you know that that was great
for me when I was running the,

1181
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:35,620
the west coast seal team training.
I saw we, we take a platoon,

1182
01:05:35,621 --> 01:05:39,130
we had these scenarios and
we put opportune through.

1183
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,520
We'd put another platoon through,
we'd put another platoon through it,

1184
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:44,980
we put another platoon through it. We
just over to the same scenario guy here,

1185
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:48,340
good shooter over here, personal on
this hilltop hostage in this room.

1186
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:50,770
We'd put all these guys
through the same scenario.

1187
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,480
And so as soon as you'd approach,

1188
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:55,360
as soon as he'd watch them
approach and you say, oh,

1189
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:57,580
the platoon commanders too far in the
rear and this is what's going to happen,

1190
01:05:57,581 --> 01:05:59,350
he's not going to see what's coming
up front up. Yep. There it is.

1191
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:01,180
And so you just know
what's going to happen.

1192
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,250
And it's the same thing when you start
dealing with their personalities.

1193
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:05,980
You get a guy with a big ego that comes
in and he wants to run everything his

1194
01:06:05,981 --> 01:06:07,600
way and he thinks he's gonna
be able to control everything.

1195
01:06:07,601 --> 01:06:10,270
And you're looking at, but he's not gonna
be Ale to do this. So you can end up,

1196
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:13,870
and I see that in the business world
obviously now to where you get the same

1197
01:06:13,871 --> 01:06:18,730
exact problems of a guy
that's too emotional about
his plan or has too big of an

1198
01:06:18,731 --> 01:06:19,690
ego about something.

1199
01:06:19,691 --> 01:06:22,570
Or He's not passing the word well enough
or there [inaudible] he's trying to

1200
01:06:22,571 --> 01:06:23,980
control everyone and
not using decentralized.

1201
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:28,240
It's so obvious because you have the reps,

1202
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,800
we have the reps now in this,
in this arena to be,

1203
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:37,510
to look at a situation and say, okay,
let me watch this. Oh, oh, okay,

1204
01:06:37,511 --> 01:06:39,820
I see what's about to happen. Here's
what's going on and we can break it down.

1205
01:06:39,821 --> 01:06:41,620
So it's the same thing across the board.

1206
01:06:41,621 --> 01:06:46,621
You get that level of just experience
and repetitions and repetitions and now

1207
01:06:47,501 --> 01:06:50,770
you can kind of see the future and you
can predict what's going to happen.

1208
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:52,540
And then the good thing
is in the business world,

1209
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:54,790
when you can predict what's
going to happen, you can stop it.

1210
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,720
You can get the people on the right track,

1211
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:59,330
pull him back in and get them arranged.
Well,

1212
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:02,000
I think the thing that a lot of people
don't realize it because sometimes I

1213
01:07:02,001 --> 01:07:03,650
think it's just different in the military.

1214
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:07,940
The reasons why people are successful in
the military and the reasons why people

1215
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:12,710
fail are exactly the same as why you
succeed in business and why you succeed as

1216
01:07:12,711 --> 01:07:15,500
a person or why you failed.
Now look, I know, you know,

1217
01:07:15,501 --> 01:07:16,520
being in an airplane is different.

1218
01:07:16,521 --> 01:07:18,620
I get that the environment might be
a little bit different being combat,

1219
01:07:18,621 --> 01:07:22,070
certainly. So the setting changes in all
these things, the setting is different,

1220
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:26,960
but the reasons are exactly the same. And
so to dispel whatever myths, you know,

1221
01:07:26,961 --> 01:07:28,040
it's different in the military.

1222
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:32,270
It's identical in the military that no
doubt it comes out in an airplane or it

1223
01:07:32,271 --> 01:07:33,830
comes out on a ship or whatever.

1224
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:36,920
It comes out in downtown Ramadi mean
the setting. Yeah, it's different.

1225
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,350
But what's going on? It's
identical. Um, and when you get to,

1226
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:46,250
when you get to be in a place where you
get to devote 100% of your time to that

1227
01:07:46,251 --> 01:07:51,230
and you're not distracted by just the
distracts of military bureaucracy and life

1228
01:07:51,231 --> 01:07:55,010
of training schedules, and did
everybody do their, uh, you know,

1229
01:07:55,011 --> 01:07:58,400
there are annual survey when you're
away from that and you're as living in a

1230
01:07:58,401 --> 01:08:01,970
world or just being tactical and doing
nothing but learning about how to be the

1231
01:08:01,971 --> 01:08:05,000
best pallet you can be in
the best teacher. Everything,

1232
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:08,180
not just being a fighter pilot.
Everything in the world slows down,

1233
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:13,100
everything slows down. Uh, and I think
it just gives you a perspective on life.

1234
01:08:13,101 --> 01:08:16,490
That top gun,
I carry those lessons.

1235
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:17,211
I mean,

1236
01:08:17,211 --> 01:08:20,600
obviously I carry that with
me in everything that I do
and I will forever. Right?

1237
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:22,730
You know,
what was honed at a place like that.

1238
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:25,670
And in some ways in the military it's
just a luxury because it's just not that

1239
01:08:25,671 --> 01:08:27,110
common to,
for someone to say,

1240
01:08:27,111 --> 01:08:29,660
for three years she was going to
do nothing but this like, dude,

1241
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:31,280
are you kidding me?
So,

1242
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:36,290
so speaking of decision making and
good and or bad decision making,

1243
01:08:36,291 --> 01:08:38,960
so you're living the dream, living
the dream. You're up in Fallon,

1244
01:08:38,961 --> 01:08:43,340
you actually have a house up in
the mountains, you're skin fly in,

1245
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:45,580
everything's good. And, and,

1246
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:49,880
and then somehow you make a decision
that's a little bit off the track a little

1247
01:08:49,881 --> 01:08:54,560
bit. What was that all about? I don't know
why she talking about, so yeah, I am a,

1248
01:08:54,561 --> 01:08:57,260
I'm in my third year at top gun at 2005,

1249
01:08:57,261 --> 01:09:01,700
I was selected to be the training officer.
So I'm running top gun as the senior,

1250
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:06,320
uh, Ip there, which is
just, it's awesome. It's a,

1251
01:09:06,321 --> 01:09:08,600
it is literally the, as a
marine, it's a dream job.

1252
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:10,940
You could not ask for anything better.
Uh,

1253
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:14,780
I was dating what ended
up becoming my wife.

1254
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:17,310
So my wife Whitney at the time were
dating, so he lives out there way,

1255
01:09:17,311 --> 01:09:21,500
had a place in Tahoe, drove a
corvette. Mike was pretty good man.

1256
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:26,270
And, um, I'm actually coming up
on my end to service obligation.

1257
01:09:26,271 --> 01:09:29,090
I can leave the Marine
Corps, uh, in 2005. And I,

1258
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:34,010
I sort of sold my relationship
to Whitney on that idea. Like,

1259
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:36,020
Hey,
come put up with this living and towel,

1260
01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:38,100
but I'm going to get out of the
Marine Corps and you don't want,

1261
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,310
don't worry about this, none of
that. This is all, it's all come,

1262
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:42,270
don't even worry about that.
And deployments war, it's over.

1263
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:44,510
You don't need to worry about that.
Uh,

1264
01:09:44,511 --> 01:09:49,010
and so I think I oversold that to her a
little bit. Got Her to move out to Tahoe.

1265
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:54,790
And so there was just a part of me that
didn't feel done with the Marine Corps.

1266
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,530
And ironically in this,

1267
01:09:59,710 --> 01:10:03,620
this amazing experience that I had built
up in my mind since I was 16 years old,

1268
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:08,070
I'm now a top gun instructor. I joined
the Marine Corps knowing cause as a,

1269
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:09,590
the [inaudible] was his big influence.

1270
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,840
I'm going to leave the Marine
Corps at top gun instructor,

1271
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:16,841
but I had spent four years a flying fat
teen's off carriers were basically in

1272
01:10:18,141 --> 01:10:20,150
the, in the navy for the,
for all intensive purposes.

1273
01:10:20,151 --> 01:10:21,320
And I was a marine in the marine squad,

1274
01:10:21,321 --> 01:10:25,790
but we deployed with navy carriers and
we and I spent three years and fallen on

1275
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:30,620
a navy base with a Navy Command is one
of three pilots on the staff at top gun.

1276
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:35,480
And there was just a part of me
that I knew I was going to be done.

1277
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:38,330
I was ready to leave the Marine Corp
but I wanted to leave the Marine Corps

1278
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,690
having fulfilled,
I think that part of being a Marine,

1279
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:46,400
oh real marine is kinda
how I felt. And so, um,

1280
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,540
again, uh, I had kind of
contemplating what I was going to do.

1281
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:53,710
You talk to somebody called your monitor,
he's the guy that gives you orders, hey,

1282
01:10:53,711 --> 01:10:54,950
this is what's next in your career.

1283
01:10:54,951 --> 01:10:57,830
This is where you're going to go for
how long we think you should do this

1284
01:10:57,831 --> 01:11:00,590
because it's helpful for whatever the
kind of explains it to you as a guy that

1285
01:11:00,591 --> 01:11:03,110
basically is responsible
for your career progression.

1286
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:06,620
And I was kind of going back and forth.
What do I do? Do I stay in, do I get out?

1287
01:11:06,621 --> 01:11:10,820
You know, I kind of was struggling
with that decision and he's like, look,

1288
01:11:10,821 --> 01:11:14,040
we're going to, you as a top
instructor, you've got a lot of skill,

1289
01:11:14,041 --> 01:11:17,550
we get a lot of experience and they want
you to use that and bring it back to

1290
01:11:17,551 --> 01:11:22,500
the Marine Corps and go to a squadron and
teach these guys. So he gave me orders.

1291
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,000
He says,
your order is going to be to go to Japan,

1292
01:11:24,001 --> 01:11:27,620
you're going to fly if [inaudible]
back to the regular fleet squadron and,

1293
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,210
and you'll go from there.
And I even,

1294
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,280
I think I even got to the point
where I had orders given to me.

1295
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:36,470
Would you have been like a squadron
commander or like an operations officer?

1296
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:40,200
A maintenance officer? I was too junior
and I'd only been in, it was like 10 year,

1297
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:42,000
11 year mark.
So I'm kind of up at what's called,

1298
01:11:42,001 --> 01:11:44,850
we call it a department head ramen or
run a major department in a squadron.

1299
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:48,930
It was operations or maintenance or
kind of the two big ones. And um,

1300
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:55,440
I, it just, it just didn't,
it's not what I want it to
do. Um, I hadn't, like I said,

1301
01:11:55,441 --> 01:11:56,910
some longterm plans and doing other stuff.

1302
01:11:56,911 --> 01:12:00,510
I was thinking long term I was going to
get out and go do something else and so

1303
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:03,380
I called the Monitor. I said,
hey, I want to do a fact tour.

1304
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:07,260
A FAC is that forward air controllers
like you'd just described earlier on the

1305
01:12:07,261 --> 01:12:10,980
podcast and we had this a little list on
the Internet that was called a hot fill

1306
01:12:10,981 --> 01:12:14,130
list whose basic all the jobs that
nobody wanted and if you called it was a

1307
01:12:14,131 --> 01:12:16,260
first come first serve and you
call it volunteer for anything,

1308
01:12:16,261 --> 01:12:17,580
you are automatically going to get it.

1309
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:21,300
And because it was just a list of jobs
that they couldn't like force on guys for

1310
01:12:21,301 --> 01:12:22,920
whatever reason I'm playing to
explaining it all that well.

1311
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:25,560
But the bottom line is the hot
fill bill. It is, you call you,

1312
01:12:25,561 --> 01:12:29,030
it's yours for any reason.
And I'm like, hey man,

1313
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,190
I see there's a hot fill to be afforded
air controller in Japan because as we

1314
01:12:32,191 --> 01:12:34,620
were going to go to Japan,
we kind of cross that bridge of okay,

1315
01:12:34,621 --> 01:12:36,810
we're going to move overseas.
We didn't have any kids with Whitney.

1316
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:41,130
This was with Whitney. She's a little bit
not super cool with it, but we found a,

1317
01:12:41,131 --> 01:12:45,360
we'll go to Japan will fly. It will be,
it'll be fine. And he's like, you're not,

1318
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:47,640
you're not going to be a
forward air controller in Japan.

1319
01:12:47,641 --> 01:12:49,170
You're going to go fly
and whatnot. I said, dude,

1320
01:12:49,171 --> 01:12:52,530
it's right there in black and white man.
It says Hotville I'm your guy.

1321
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:58,140
And he was like, okay. Yeah, I mean he and
so he gave me these orders and I wanted,

1322
01:12:58,530 --> 01:13:01,650
I wanted to be a fact because I wanted
to leave the marine corps having

1323
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:04,320
fulfilled all the parts
about being a marine.

1324
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:06,930
And in my mind it's funny cause
it's like we're opposite on that.

1325
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:10,110
The real challenge of the thing
I didn't really want to do,

1326
01:13:10,111 --> 01:13:13,980
but I knew I should was getting out of
the airplane and doing something really

1327
01:13:13,981 --> 01:13:14,814
hard on the ground.

1328
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:19,810
Like my natural state in the Marine Corps
is in an airplane and for some people

1329
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:21,630
they're miserable. I don't
want to do it. For me that was,

1330
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:25,950
so to do that was to be a forward
air controller was, and it's,

1331
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:27,630
it's strange to hear myself say it.

1332
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:29,820
I didn't want to go be a
forward air controller,

1333
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:32,100
but I knew I needed to go do that.
There's no,

1334
01:13:32,101 --> 01:13:35,580
I needed to leave the Marine Corp
and say, yeah, I did that too.

1335
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:39,810
And it was just a matter
I think of fulfillment of
kind of an exclamation point

1336
01:13:39,811 --> 01:13:41,350
on a career that I
always kind of fantasize.

1337
01:13:41,351 --> 01:13:42,600
And as I learned more
about the marine corps,

1338
01:13:42,610 --> 01:13:45,780
there was more to it than just being a
pilot. Right. So I just wanted that. So,

1339
01:13:45,781 --> 01:13:48,960
so in your mind, were you thinking
forward air controller in Japan met,

1340
01:13:48,970 --> 01:13:51,330
you're going to go over there, you
know, have a little team of marines.

1341
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:56,080
You'd go out to the different
training ranges, call for
some bombs, all good. You,

1342
01:13:56,081 --> 01:13:59,320
you know, go home at night, be
with your wife, might even go,

1343
01:13:59,321 --> 01:14:03,690
I'm in Japan just in just a nice
little sort of like a long vacation,

1344
01:14:03,790 --> 01:14:06,180
working a little bit of time on the
ground. I get to go to the field.

1345
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:09,060
I spend the night in the woods, you're
smelling something like that, you know,

1346
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:13,030
it really cool camping and they pay for
it. Yeah. So yeah, that's what it was.

1347
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:15,820
I was going to go to Japan.
There's a bunch of really cool,

1348
01:14:15,821 --> 01:14:17,740
it was going to be an oak and how
actually so not mainland Japan.

1349
01:14:17,741 --> 01:14:21,050
Okinawa has got great scuba diving
and it's Kinda neat and you know,

1350
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:25,300
I could bring my wife with me.
It was gonna be a lot of fun and you can,

1351
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:28,090
I can train. I was going to teach guys
how to use airplanes to drop bombs.

1352
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:30,670
I knew how to do that.
I was going to be a really cool thing.

1353
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:35,500
So I get these orders and my
wife and I moved out to Japan.

1354
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:37,760
We got there and uh,
to Okinawa,

1355
01:14:37,761 --> 01:14:40,330
a place called camp pants and a little
base up there in the middle of the island.

1356
01:14:40,331 --> 01:14:42,790
And I'm there probably,

1357
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:49,780
dude, I'm probably there a week and my
boss, the brigade platoon commanders like,

1358
01:14:49,781 --> 01:14:53,980
Hey your, we're going to send a brigade
platoon, which is probably 50 guys,

1359
01:14:53,981 --> 01:14:54,401
I'm guessing,

1360
01:14:54,401 --> 01:14:58,660
I'm guessing at the numbers to Camp
Lajune because of that angle go.

1361
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:02,440
Just came back from seven months in
Iraq and they need to go right back and

1362
01:15:02,441 --> 01:15:06,940
turned very quick turnaround or they
don't have enough qualified guys. And so,

1363
01:15:06,941 --> 01:15:09,310
I mean, I'm there a week and I'm
coming home until Whitney like, hey,

1364
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:11,373
here's the deal.

1365
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:15,640
They need guys to go out to Laguna to
do this deployment to Iraq and I'm going

1366
01:15:15,641 --> 01:15:19,870
to be one of those guys. So we were there
instead of a year we were there for,

1367
01:15:19,871 --> 01:15:22,180
maybe she's like,
is there snorkeling

1368
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:26,980
because you were telling
me about scuba diving.

1369
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:31,780
So we crammed a year's worth of stuff
and about six weeks, because we had,

1370
01:15:31,781 --> 01:15:35,620
so it was probably maybe early November,
uh,

1371
01:15:35,621 --> 01:15:37,660
when the word kind of came down and we
knew that we had till the end of the

1372
01:15:37,661 --> 01:15:41,120
calendar year.
So we shoved a year's worth of living in,

1373
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:44,320
in Japan in about six weeks.
And when we did Korea,

1374
01:15:44,321 --> 01:15:47,800
we did Thailand who did mainland in Tokyo.
We did got her dad called,

1375
01:15:47,801 --> 01:15:52,000
I mean we did it all, only December
22nd or whatever it was, you know,

1376
01:15:52,001 --> 01:15:56,710
we flew home and I went straight to the
lagoon from there to start training with

1377
01:15:56,711 --> 01:15:58,210
second Anglico,
uh,

1378
01:15:58,211 --> 01:16:01,630
which was the team that had just come
back from Iraq after their seven month

1379
01:16:01,631 --> 01:16:03,420
deployment on a very quick turn,

1380
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:04,870
there are probably four
months into their turnaround.

1381
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,190
So just real quick for people
that don't know what Anglico is,

1382
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:14,040
the Anglico Anglico stands for
air naval gunfire liaison company.

1383
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:19,060
And really what it is is it's a group
of, it's a, it's a group of small teams,

1384
01:16:19,061 --> 01:16:22,240
four or five man teams called fire power
control teams. And what those teams,

1385
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:25,720
we're all supposed to be able
to do is control airplanes,

1386
01:16:25,721 --> 01:16:29,680
tell airplanes what to do with their
bombs. Uh, we could control artillery.

1387
01:16:29,681 --> 01:16:33,340
So how to fire artillery ordinance and
even we didn't do it there and Iraq,

1388
01:16:33,341 --> 01:16:35,980
but we could use naval gunfire.
So guns off ships,

1389
01:16:35,981 --> 01:16:38,980
we were training all three of those skill
sets and the whole point of an angle

1390
01:16:38,981 --> 01:16:43,660
go and a place like Iraq is,
it's, you had different units.

1391
01:16:43,661 --> 01:16:45,760
He had no navy units, army
units, Marine Corps units,

1392
01:16:45,761 --> 01:16:49,420
and as an angle go your liaison. So that's
what the l and angle go is. So I could,

1393
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:52,300
I was trained to go to an army
unit and know how army does,

1394
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:53,860
people may not know this,

1395
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:56,200
all of the servers is actually
do the same job differently.

1396
01:16:56,590 --> 01:16:59,530
So the army and the Marine Corps will
get the same mission and have a totally

1397
01:16:59,531 --> 01:17:01,780
different way of doing it cause their
doctrine or their training is different.

1398
01:17:01,781 --> 01:17:05,050
Now it's similar but there's a bunch of
pretty critical differences in there.

1399
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:09,290
And so what we're trying to do is we had
all marine airplanes in where we were

1400
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:12,800
in Iraq and all army land forces and so
the army doesn't have any training in

1401
01:17:12,801 --> 01:17:13,470
how to use Marine Corps.

1402
01:17:13,470 --> 01:17:17,630
Airpoints Marine Corp does have a lot
of training to use army ground forces.

1403
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:19,250
So when those two people connect,
there's,

1404
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:21,830
there's a problem with how
they communicate. And what
they want from each other.

1405
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:26,810
Insert Anglico. We're the liaison between
the army ground units and in this case,

1406
01:17:26,811 --> 01:17:28,250
the Marine Corps air units.

1407
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:32,090
So my job was to control marine airplanes
to support the army on the ground.

1408
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:34,190
And that was all over Iraq.

1409
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:38,420
And what the Anglico team would take this
whole group and break it into maybe 25,

1410
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:43,540
four man teams and when all of the
country to go do this same mission with a

1411
01:17:44,061 --> 01:17:45,170
whole bunch of different units.

1412
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,450
And so that was our mission
as a forward air controller.

1413
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:50,690
And I was qualified as a forward air
controller because I had flown airplanes,

1414
01:17:50,710 --> 01:17:52,540
drop bombs and combat,
understood how fat is.

1415
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:54,050
We're supposed to support ground maneuver.

1416
01:17:54,051 --> 01:17:56,180
And I went to school for air controllers.
Cool.

1417
01:17:56,181 --> 01:18:00,630
So let's go to Japan will be fun or
pretend to do that for a year. Um,

1418
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:03,020
and then we end up in Campbell,

1419
01:18:03,021 --> 01:18:06,200
the June training to go to Iraq.

1420
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:10,580
And now it's your first time
kind of doing grunt work. Right?

1421
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:12,950
So last time I had held a rifle,

1422
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:17,990
shot a rifle and worn a pair of
combat boots was the basic school.

1423
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:23,580
So I had, um, you know, I
was, I got my air slot at,

1424
01:18:23,581 --> 01:18:26,750
at TBS. That was a big day for me. Uh,
you know, I'd done six months of that.

1425
01:18:26,751 --> 01:18:27,950
I've had that check in the block.

1426
01:18:27,951 --> 01:18:30,650
I was feeling pretty good
about that and I had never,

1427
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:33,260
I don't think I put on my
Kamia my camouflage uniform.

1428
01:18:33,261 --> 01:18:35,870
I think I wear a flight suit.
Honestly.

1429
01:18:35,871 --> 01:18:39,800
I think everyday for seven years I
could probably count on one hand,

1430
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:41,930
well even longer than that,
I wasn't even counting flight school.

1431
01:18:41,931 --> 01:18:46,520
I could probably count on one hand the
number of days that I didn't wear a

1432
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:49,970
flight suit from the time that I selected
to go to flight school to the time

1433
01:18:49,971 --> 01:18:54,800
that I ended up at Anglico days.
I mean, so this was a foreign,

1434
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:56,870
now I had,
I was a marine,

1435
01:18:57,020 --> 01:19:01,750
I went through the basic school was all
back there somewhere. Um, but you know,

1436
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:04,910
I think there is this, and I've
mentioned this, I think to you,

1437
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:08,510
I think it's a sort of this habit
of self sabotage. Like, well,

1438
01:19:08,511 --> 01:19:11,660
I can't leave the Marine Corp.
That being a, being a real marine.

1439
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:15,350
So I'm going to literally sabotaging
myself by volunteering for a job that I

1440
01:19:15,351 --> 01:19:18,080
don't know if I really want to do,
but now I'm stuck doing it.

1441
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:21,830
So I'm going to have to do that. So I
won't ever have to say I didn't do that.

1442
01:19:22,430 --> 01:19:26,750
So this kind of cycle of
break promises to my wife, uh,

1443
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:29,330
volunteering for stuff I didn't really
want to do but knew that I should.

1444
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:32,420
And next thing you know, it all blew up
in my face cause I, let's go to Japan.

1445
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:33,943
Japan's awesome,

1446
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:38,300
good Sushi and great experience there
and it's gonna be awesome and I will be a

1447
01:19:38,301 --> 01:19:40,010
fact and I can for the rest of my life,
say,

1448
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:44,420
well was a royal marine that was a
fact and I did all that. And you know,

1449
01:19:44,421 --> 01:19:47,060
it's January and Campbell
shuffle look. Yeah, there's four.

1450
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:52,810
So yeah, make no mistake. I mean,
I, I did that, I volunteered,

1451
01:19:52,811 --> 01:19:57,690
but I did not at the time when I was
trading in my flying orders for these Faq

1452
01:19:57,691 --> 01:20:02,420
orders.
I didn't expect to be in Ramadi but as,

1453
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:06,790
hey, we need to send a brigade platoon
to uh, Campbell's unit prep those guys.

1454
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:09,510
Of course. Yep. I'm going, I
mean I'm not going to not go.

1455
01:20:09,511 --> 01:20:10,830
That's what we need to do.
We're going to go do that.

1456
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:14,820
When I got to Campbell as you and I
ended up being the senior just by rank,

1457
01:20:14,821 --> 01:20:16,820
the senior f a forward air
controller in the unit,

1458
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:21,180
I was kind of a mid level major,
um, you know, come from top gun.

1459
01:20:21,181 --> 01:20:23,580
I came straight from talking to that
and I was experienced guy and the

1460
01:20:23,581 --> 01:20:24,570
commanding officer,
no joke.

1461
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:28,620
I can picture the day walks in one day
and he hands me a piece of paper and it's

1462
01:20:28,621 --> 01:20:30,780
got like 26 lines on it.
One for every team.

1463
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:35,730
And on the other sheet was all the
locations that we were going to go to and

1464
01:20:35,731 --> 01:20:37,200
he's like,
fill out where all the teams are going.

1465
01:20:37,201 --> 01:20:39,990
Cause we've got to cover these
15 different locations, you know,

1466
01:20:39,991 --> 01:20:43,200
one to two teams per location and just
write the number of the team on there and

1467
01:20:43,201 --> 01:20:45,840
get this back to me by close of business.
Like Roger that sir, I take care of it.

1468
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:47,963
And

1469
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:51,360
again, my wife loves the story
and I didn't tell her at the time,

1470
01:20:51,361 --> 01:20:55,710
but my best friend who I grew up
with was in Ramadi at the time.

1471
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:56,640
He was in third battalion,

1472
01:20:56,641 --> 01:21:00,870
seventh Marines who we replaced when we
got out there or we did a turnover with.

1473
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:02,533
And

1474
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:05,400
that's where the war was. Man. I mean in,

1475
01:21:05,401 --> 01:21:09,240
in late 2005 and early 2006
the world was in Ramadi.

1476
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:13,530
And so I took the pen,
I wrote lightening six and so six one six,

1477
01:21:13,531 --> 01:21:15,030
two and six three we're all going Ramadi.

1478
01:21:15,031 --> 01:21:17,760
And I handed it off to ever filled
it out, gave to the CEO. And so,

1479
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:20,003
mmm.

1480
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:23,740
If you're going to go do something
you don't necessarily want to do,

1481
01:21:23,741 --> 01:21:25,150
but you're going to go do it,
you might as well do it.

1482
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:27,610
And that's where the war was.

1483
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:30,280
I could have gone to a whole host of
other places where there's not much going

1484
01:21:30,281 --> 01:21:32,080
on.
It would have been relatively chill.

1485
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:35,290
I would've gotten that check in the
block for sure. I would have said, yeah,

1486
01:21:35,291 --> 01:21:39,460
I went to here or there and Nope, no hit
on the guys who were different places.

1487
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:43,120
It just, it was just more going on
there. Um, and if I wasn't gonna go,

1488
01:21:43,121 --> 01:21:44,320
then somebody else is going to go do that.

1489
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:48,110
Was Neil Neil was telling you what was
up. He said, hey, it's on big time. No,

1490
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:51,470
he and I were tight and
we talked as regular as we
could, as much as we can say.

1491
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:53,020
Was He telling you like,
Oh yeah,

1492
01:21:53,021 --> 01:21:55,570
I was putting rounds over shooting
yesterday and you said, well,

1493
01:21:55,571 --> 01:21:59,500
what were you shooting out? And
he's like, people, yeah, I was just,

1494
01:21:59,501 --> 01:22:02,420
it was such a foreign thing to me as
a pilot. Certainly coming from top,

1495
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:03,520
this is my best friend too.

1496
01:22:03,610 --> 01:22:06,400
And our whole life we both wanted
to be a marine pilots and we, we,

1497
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:10,090
we never were in the same unit together.
We just couldn't get aligned with that.

1498
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:13,150
It never occurred to me when we were
kids dreaming about being a Marine Corps

1499
01:22:13,151 --> 01:22:16,720
fighter pilots at the only time we'd
ever served together was in Ramadi as

1500
01:22:16,721 --> 01:22:19,180
forward air controllers. I,
he'll listen to this podcast,

1501
01:22:19,181 --> 01:22:20,560
he'll get a good chuckle out of this.
But,

1502
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:23,680
so he was there for the seven months
prior. So I think the something, you know,

1503
01:22:23,681 --> 01:22:28,150
maybe June or July of that year when
I was getting ready to get orders,

1504
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:32,260
he was on his factor and he was
just a battalion back in three,

1505
01:22:32,261 --> 01:22:36,250
seven Oh p two nine three will be herea
oppa just doing the deed, man. I mean,

1506
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:40,150
getting after. Yeah,
big time and struggling.

1507
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:43,030
We know there's a lot going on there.
And when he would tell me these stories,

1508
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:46,810
even someone who had been a marine
for that long, he's like, yeah,

1509
01:22:46,811 --> 01:22:50,110
we're in a firefight. And I'm like, are
you shooting a rifle? Is like, yeah man,

1510
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:53,670
I get what it's like the people that are
shooting at me. It just, it, it, it's,

1511
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:56,740
you're disconnected and you have this,

1512
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,540
you don't have the sense
of what that means.

1513
01:22:58,541 --> 01:23:01,990
And so even as I was processing what he
was saying and trying to understand and

1514
01:23:01,991 --> 01:23:04,960
then saying, this is where the,
this is what I'm going to go do,

1515
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:08,200
kind of volunteering to go do that.
I'll be honest with you,

1516
01:23:08,201 --> 01:23:12,700
there's still a part in retrospect that
didn't really quite fully grasp what

1517
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:16,480
that meant. I don't know how anybody
on the first deployment to a place,

1518
01:23:16,481 --> 01:23:20,320
like Ramadi goes into that. You know, I
dabbled aviation. You're like you said,

1519
01:23:20,321 --> 01:23:23,120
I'm up in the sky. I mean,
it's relatively safe. Uh,

1520
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:25,510
and I'm sure even the first
appointment you did, there's just,

1521
01:23:25,570 --> 01:23:28,420
there's an element of just not
being able to fully understand it.

1522
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:31,900
And that didn't even become clear to me
until right when we're getting ready to

1523
01:23:31,901 --> 01:23:35,280
leave from Adi and the new units coming
in and I was explaining what they're

1524
01:23:35,281 --> 01:23:37,390
meant to get into.
That's when it really hit me.

1525
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:39,910
And I just remind myself a year earlier,
I'm like,

1526
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,610
I'm that dude that really doesn't know
what the hell is about to happen to him

1527
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:46,780
and what's about to go on.
But it was like I said, man,

1528
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:49,960
I don't even want it to make it
sound like that big of a deal.

1529
01:23:49,961 --> 01:23:52,190
But I volunteer for a fact to her.

1530
01:23:52,630 --> 01:23:55,510
They need to guys to go to London to
go to Iraq. That's where reminders,

1531
01:23:55,511 --> 01:23:58,060
where the fight was my best friend
who was there. I'm going to Ramadi.

1532
01:23:58,420 --> 01:24:00,790
And that was about it. It was just,
that's where I thought I should do.

1533
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:05,320
So I went to [inaudible] and now
you're leading marines too. Yeah.

1534
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:09,400
And yes. So I, I,

1535
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:14,040
I explained just a minute ago about
those things that make you successful and

1536
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:16,510
things that,
that lead to failure are identical.

1537
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:19,690
They are the exact same things in an
airplane or the same on the ground,

1538
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:24,040
but the environment is different.
It is different.

1539
01:24:24,041 --> 01:24:28,840
There's no way around it. And I also
would say to that, and for good reason,

1540
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:30,940
I think the ground marines,
you know,

1541
01:24:30,941 --> 01:24:32,380
I worked with a lot of
infantry and artillery.

1542
01:24:32,710 --> 01:24:36,160
Most of Anglico was made up of artillery
and some infantry not, and you know,

1543
01:24:36,161 --> 01:24:37,660
obviously there's pilots
that are controllers.

1544
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:42,700
There's a decent bit of skepticism
of pilots coming in to lead these,

1545
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:46,900
these teams. And I think for good reason,
you know, because a lot of these guys,

1546
01:24:46,901 --> 01:24:48,370
when I talked about combat experience,

1547
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:52,030
they're on their third fourth deployment
to Iraq. Totally man. You're coming in.

1548
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:54,130
Yep, they're on there.
They've already done,

1549
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:58,360
you're wearing your top gun patch on
your shoulder and your kidneys. Well,

1550
01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:01,210
what's worse is I'm not wearing my
top gun patch, I'm wearing my cammies.

1551
01:25:01,211 --> 01:25:04,810
And they're like, have you ever wash those
cameras? I'm like, as a matter of fact,

1552
01:25:04,811 --> 01:25:06,880
I haven't, they're fresh, you know,

1553
01:25:06,881 --> 01:25:10,120
brand new and they're
wearing their cammies from,

1554
01:25:10,150 --> 01:25:11,830
they did the march up to Baghdad.

1555
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:13,840
They went home for four months
in second wrap back around.

1556
01:25:13,841 --> 01:25:16,060
And did Oyu have two guys
that did full allusion?

1557
01:25:16,061 --> 01:25:18,820
They're back and they're on their
third appointment in three years.

1558
01:25:18,850 --> 01:25:22,000
And they're legit deployments.
And you know, Dave Burke,

1559
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:24,750
Mr Top gun shows up and is like, hey,
where's this brigade platoon? You know,

1560
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:28,270
where's my salt team? You know?
And I think that skepticism of

1561
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:33,190
for good reason is who is this guy?
And that's a real,

1562
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:36,610
that was a real leadership challenge
for me is to apply those things,

1563
01:25:36,611 --> 01:25:38,650
things that I knew or they were effective,

1564
01:25:39,070 --> 01:25:41,410
but in an environment that I'm
totally out of my comfort zone, man.

1565
01:25:41,411 --> 01:25:46,411
I'm totally out of my comfort zone and I
have to apply a skillset of things that

1566
01:25:46,991 --> 01:25:49,570
I just haven't,
I haven't shot a rifle since 1994.

1567
01:25:50,170 --> 01:25:51,970
I got to the basic school in October 94.

1568
01:25:51,971 --> 01:25:53,500
The first thing you do
is go to the rifle range.

1569
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:58,210
There's the last time I squeeze the
trigger on a rifle was October of 1994 and

1570
01:25:58,211 --> 01:26:02,020
here it is is, you know, January
of 2006 prepping to go to Ramadi.

1571
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:07,190
And I've got a site in my m four,
so they should be skeptical a little bit.

1572
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:09,230
And, um, it was a challenge for me,

1573
01:26:09,231 --> 01:26:12,560
a real leadership challenge of to be
successful in a place that I'm not

1574
01:26:12,561 --> 01:26:13,730
comfortable with.
To be honest with you.

1575
01:26:14,310 --> 01:26:17,030
If you told me I was going
to lead a squadron in combat,

1576
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:21,770
I'd feel pretty comfortable doing that.
I know it'd be a challenge. It'd be hard,

1577
01:26:21,771 --> 01:26:25,470
but I wouldn't feel like I don't know
about this. I would be all over it.

1578
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:29,940
I don't mean to say easy, but right in
my wheelhouse, not, not true for that.

1579
01:26:29,941 --> 01:26:34,460
And so, um, I worked hard to try to
be successful in that. And you know,

1580
01:26:34,461 --> 01:26:37,040
you gotta get your Marines
to buy off on your program,

1581
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:40,580
you know that because you're going to
go downtown with those guys, you know?

1582
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:44,300
And every relationship with anyone of
those guys was different as you know,

1583
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:47,600
when you've got to build
those relationships and
demonstrate that, you know,

1584
01:26:47,601 --> 01:26:49,960
this is gonna work. And then, you know,

1585
01:26:49,970 --> 01:26:53,870
just talk a little bit about your people
have heard about what to you bruiser

1586
01:26:53,871 --> 01:26:57,830
was doing over in Ramadi and
we'll get to how we interacted.

1587
01:26:57,831 --> 01:27:00,770
But overall, oh, you guys
doing, when you first got there,

1588
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:03,290
you just kind of jumped into it.

1589
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:08,060
We can feed as they say we did man.
Um,

1590
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:09,560
so I get there.

1591
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:14,030
I've got assault team that stands for
supporting arms liaison team. It really,

1592
01:27:14,031 --> 01:27:17,180
what it meant was three of
those little Forman teams, uh,

1593
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:20,810
grouped together in a one 13 man team
cause we had an additional corpsman,

1594
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:22,550
little, uh, medic with us.

1595
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:27,950
So I had three of those teams that I was
responsible for and I kind of knew what

1596
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:29,840
I expected was going to happen.

1597
01:27:29,841 --> 01:27:32,210
I got there that I would be
in what's called the Toc,

1598
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:34,010
the tactical operations center,
which was,

1599
01:27:34,770 --> 01:27:39,110
I'd kind of run things from the desk
and it's farm out my teams and units to

1600
01:27:39,111 --> 01:27:40,520
support the guys that needed our help,

1601
01:27:40,521 --> 01:27:42,170
these army units or we're
going to go do missions.

1602
01:27:42,230 --> 01:27:45,200
They needed someone to help them
control the air. I had those teams,

1603
01:27:45,201 --> 01:27:46,250
I would give them those teams.

1604
01:27:46,850 --> 01:27:51,850
Well it took basically no time to get
there and realize that the demand signal

1605
01:27:52,251 --> 01:27:56,270
for our support was higher than
we could have ever responded to.

1606
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:59,810
They needed 20 of our teams,
not three.

1607
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:03,590
And so that idea that I
would kind of be a coc guy,

1608
01:28:03,591 --> 01:28:07,550
a top guy was over in the first day
because as I get there and we're going to

1609
01:28:07,551 --> 01:28:09,890
the turnover with the other Anglico
team getting ready to leave,

1610
01:28:10,190 --> 01:28:12,350
he's introducing me to all the
people he had been working with.

1611
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:16,330
And it's like 15 different teams,
you know,

1612
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:20,420
they're not running operations
with like three battalions,

1613
01:28:20,450 --> 01:28:23,270
it's 40 squats,
you know,

1614
01:28:23,271 --> 01:28:27,980
and these guys are going out in 1213 man
teams and they all need you. Yup. So,

1615
01:28:28,010 --> 01:28:30,020
and there's operations I've been,
just so everyone knows,

1616
01:28:30,021 --> 01:28:33,730
there's 5,600 people in the one one
80 or you showed up with two, two,

1617
01:28:33,740 --> 01:28:38,720
two to 6,000 people or
whatever. And there's operations
going on all over Ramadi,

1618
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:40,460
every single micros,
people patrolling.

1619
01:28:40,461 --> 01:28:42,350
There's people getting in
firefights every single night.

1620
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:43,670
There's constant gunfire.

1621
01:28:43,970 --> 01:28:47,030
And so there's no way with three
teams you're going to cover all that.

1622
01:28:47,031 --> 01:28:51,590
You can't do it. Yeah. And that was sort
of the immediate awareness for me is

1623
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:56,960
not only was I not going to
be able to support everything,

1624
01:28:56,961 --> 01:28:59,120
I know how to prioritize and tell folks,
hey,

1625
01:28:59,121 --> 01:29:02,340
we can do this and not that
I can you here or there.

1626
01:29:02,341 --> 01:29:06,510
And so very quickly it was a matter of
how am I going to break down my team and

1627
01:29:06,511 --> 01:29:08,910
support these guys.
Um,

1628
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:13,290
I did have an advantage
that I was as an fat pilot.

1629
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:14,610
That was the primary aircraft,

1630
01:29:14,611 --> 01:29:17,220
Faa teens in Harrods or the primary
aircraft that was doing the support.

1631
01:29:17,221 --> 01:29:22,080
And I knew those airplanes really well
and I was able to very quickly when I saw

1632
01:29:22,081 --> 01:29:22,980
what the army,
hey,

1633
01:29:22,981 --> 01:29:26,250
we're doing this patrol today and we're
going to take our humvees from the camp

1634
01:29:26,251 --> 01:29:27,810
Remati to go to this location.

1635
01:29:28,140 --> 01:29:30,360
And it would be really
difficult just to get there.

1636
01:29:30,361 --> 01:29:33,690
Just navigating at night in your Humvees
on the night vision goggles and the

1637
01:29:33,691 --> 01:29:35,970
roads can be kind of confusing and
you know what it's like down there.

1638
01:29:35,971 --> 01:29:39,900
And some days you're operating in
downtown Ramadi and it's straight up urban

1639
01:29:39,901 --> 01:29:44,670
combat, like just buildings and five
miles away. You can be in a place,

1640
01:29:44,671 --> 01:29:48,620
we call it Mike, Charlie one that
it looks like Vietnam. I mean it's,

1641
01:29:48,621 --> 01:29:51,820
it's the contrast if for
being so close together,

1642
01:29:51,821 --> 01:29:54,270
it was so incredible how
different those places were.

1643
01:29:54,271 --> 01:29:57,600
And so every environment was different.
I was able to understand how,

1644
01:29:57,601 --> 01:30:00,480
what airplanes could do well and
not well in those environments.

1645
01:30:00,481 --> 01:30:03,900
And so as they asked for support, I'm
like, Hey, I can't really do that,

1646
01:30:03,901 --> 01:30:05,340
but what I can do is this,

1647
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:07,920
and maybe this would be more helpful
for you and I can very quickly build a

1648
01:30:07,921 --> 01:30:09,480
relationship with the army,

1649
01:30:09,481 --> 01:30:13,050
which is really who you needed to
be the best support for the marines.

1650
01:30:13,050 --> 01:30:14,970
They were going to get on board.
We're good. We had a relationship.

1651
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:19,260
I wasn't worried about my
marines and US building our team.

1652
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:22,230
What I was worried about was us as a team,

1653
01:30:22,231 --> 01:30:26,550
being effective for the folks that were
supporting and showing that we could do

1654
01:30:26,551 --> 01:30:29,690
good work for those guys. And we
took a very different approach. Uh,

1655
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:32,940
I immediately broke our team into three
separate teams. Six one, six, two and six.

1656
01:30:32,941 --> 01:30:35,760
Three I actually sent the six three team,

1657
01:30:35,761 --> 01:30:38,790
a guy named Alan to
another base blue diamond.

1658
01:30:38,791 --> 01:30:41,640
You remember that base right across the
river because there was a company based

1659
01:30:41,641 --> 01:30:44,190
out of blue diamond that we're
doing operations independently.

1660
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:47,000
They never had any ANGLICO support,
so I do, do you gotta go move?

1661
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:51,070
They literally moved there and lived
with those guys and then my other teams,

1662
01:30:51,071 --> 01:30:54,870
six one or six to Adam and I just,

1663
01:30:54,930 --> 01:30:59,670
we took a whiteboard and all the
requests for support and we just started

1664
01:30:59,671 --> 01:31:03,270
plugging in her names in and so it was
just, I had five guys. He had four.

1665
01:31:03,271 --> 01:31:06,150
He had his own Humvee. I had
my own Humvee. We had all
the weapons, all the radios,

1666
01:31:06,151 --> 01:31:10,080
and just started to just go do operations.
Two to eight.

1667
01:31:10,081 --> 01:31:12,450
We'll do everything for just a little
vehicle patrol where they're just do a

1668
01:31:12,451 --> 01:31:14,640
president patrol there,
two Humvees driving around the city.

1669
01:31:14,641 --> 01:31:16,800
We would just jump in on that
and just bring a third truck,

1670
01:31:16,801 --> 01:31:18,450
which was a ton of
firepower and awareness.

1671
01:31:18,930 --> 01:31:22,380
Sometimes we're just doing foot patrols
and we would just go walk around and do

1672
01:31:22,381 --> 01:31:26,700
move into contact or do room
clearing, stuff like that. Jocko, man,

1673
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:29,190
I found myself way,

1674
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,860
way out of my comfort zone very early.

1675
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:36,861
I think my second mission there was a
raid where I was ended up like clearing a

1676
01:31:39,361 --> 01:31:39,751
room.

1677
01:31:39,751 --> 01:31:44,640
I was in a stack of dudes clearing
a room while I was trying to talk to

1678
01:31:44,641 --> 01:31:49,641
airplanes overhead of were and it was
just a basically a manpower shortage.

1679
01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:54,360
It's like, yeah, you can get in. Yeah, go.
You and these two guys go clean the room.

1680
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:58,340
I don't mean Roger that, you know, um, and
I was a senior or mid grade majors are,

1681
01:31:58,350 --> 01:32:00,700
I was always kind one of the senior guys,
but I wasn't in charge of this.

1682
01:32:00,701 --> 01:32:03,400
So I'll be working for a first lieutenant,
which was perfectly fine.

1683
01:32:03,401 --> 01:32:05,830
It was his platoon. He was doing this
mission. He knew what he was doing.

1684
01:32:06,190 --> 01:32:09,070
I was there to support as best
as I could that image of like,

1685
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:11,080
y'all just get up on the roof and
control air. It'll be awesome.

1686
01:32:11,170 --> 01:32:15,280
What do you need me to blow up?
Negative. I mean it was, hey,

1687
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:17,740
get in line and start getting after it.
And I think that,

1688
01:32:17,770 --> 01:32:19,060
I remember that second mission,

1689
01:32:20,030 --> 01:32:23,220
we're with the two to eight and the
lieutenant was, I think he was like, uh,

1690
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:25,540
I think he worked at
home depot. No, Jessica.

1691
01:32:25,541 --> 01:32:27,370
Cause there was a national guard
unit and national guardian.

1692
01:32:27,410 --> 01:32:30,850
These dudes were awesome. He's been
there for probably 10 or 11 months.

1693
01:32:30,851 --> 01:32:32,080
By the time I got there,
maybe even longer,

1694
01:32:32,081 --> 01:32:37,060
they'd been there almost a year hardened
dudes that had lost a lot of guys and

1695
01:32:37,061 --> 01:32:37,900
sacrifice a ton.

1696
01:32:37,901 --> 01:32:40,480
But I was learning everything I could
from them because they were veterans and I

1697
01:32:40,481 --> 01:32:43,180
was brand new. I was supposed
to bring this great capability,

1698
01:32:43,181 --> 01:32:46,150
but the reality was I was just soaking
up from them as much as I could.

1699
01:32:47,290 --> 01:32:50,320
And I'm clearing a room with this guy,
you know,

1700
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:57,010
so the phrase of what am I doing
here? Oh, uh, went through my head.

1701
01:32:57,190 --> 01:33:00,470
I'll watt a while. I was there
and it was just Kinda, it.

1702
01:33:00,510 --> 01:33:03,520
Ramadi was a type of place that the
deal was, is that when you got there,

1703
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:08,660
it was just a bullet train and you
just jumped on the train or you had to,

1704
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:11,800
you couldn't slow things down
and you certainly couldn't
ask. There's other guys,

1705
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:14,620
hey, can we, can we dial it back a
little bit? We need to get up to speed.

1706
01:33:15,250 --> 01:33:18,280
They were just doing their thing and if
you are going to be anything other than

1707
01:33:18,281 --> 01:33:20,620
a hindrance that you need
to get on board immediately.

1708
01:33:21,130 --> 01:33:24,210
And so that's what we
did as best we could. Um,

1709
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:28,450
and I have a lot to thank for the guys
at [inaudible] because no matter how hard

1710
01:33:28,451 --> 01:33:31,600
we tried those first couple
of times, we're, we're just
getting up to speed. We're,

1711
01:33:31,870 --> 01:33:34,370
we're not, uh, you know,
bringing our a game yet we're,

1712
01:33:34,371 --> 01:33:35,800
we're trying to figure out
what's going on around us.

1713
01:33:35,801 --> 01:33:38,800
And there's no doubt that without
those guys, their leadership,

1714
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:41,290
their willingness to kind of bring
us on board and get us up to speed,

1715
01:33:41,890 --> 01:33:46,570
that played a big part. We got up to
speed quickly, but they, one I'm sure,

1716
01:33:46,571 --> 01:33:47,740
you know,
we were struggling to kill us.

1717
01:33:47,740 --> 01:33:52,120
Like we were talking about with flying
and Jujitsu and fighting everything else.

1718
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:55,660
You show up there and things are going,
they're not slowed down a third,

1719
01:33:55,690 --> 01:33:58,810
they're going five times faster
and you're just seeing, you know,

1720
01:33:58,811 --> 01:34:00,250
you're getting told to clear a room.

1721
01:34:00,251 --> 01:34:02,860
That's the only thing in the world you
can see is now this room and you're not

1722
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:04,840
aware of all this other
stuff that's going on.

1723
01:34:04,841 --> 01:34:07,180
And it definitely takes
some ops to get your,

1724
01:34:07,510 --> 01:34:10,930
get your senses about you of what's
happening. Yeah. And the ops were,

1725
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:13,420
there were so many different kinds
of operations. Like I said, you know,

1726
01:34:13,421 --> 01:34:16,300
you'd go from doing just um, you know, uh,

1727
01:34:16,301 --> 01:34:21,070
three Humvee presence patrol in
downtown Ramadi is not cool. It's not,

1728
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,070
it's just you're just waiting
for something to go wrong.

1729
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:27,820
Whether it's getting lit up, you know, in
a firefight, RPGs getting shot. I mean,

1730
01:34:27,821 --> 01:34:31,150
you are literally just driving around
waiting for somebody to do something to

1731
01:34:31,151 --> 01:34:34,510
you. You know, these presence patrols
and then you go right from that too.

1732
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:38,420
You get some intelligence that somebody
needed to grab was in a, you know,

1733
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:41,260
a house somewhere in a totally different
environment and you'd be off doing a

1734
01:34:41,261 --> 01:34:44,740
raid. We help stand up the QRF.
You've talked about that in the past,

1735
01:34:44,741 --> 01:34:48,550
that quick reaction force
where you literally just
waited right outside the gate

1736
01:34:48,551 --> 01:34:52,570
of the main base for somebody to call
for help. Okay, something's gone wrong.

1737
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,460
It's here.
Come help us.

1738
01:34:54,490 --> 01:34:58,010
And so we just started doing
all these missions and I,

1739
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:02,330
I just was on board with
all of them and they very,

1740
01:35:02,350 --> 01:35:06,030
they were very different from day to day.
And you got to call for fire to do,

1741
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:10,910
you legit. We did. And we, we,
between me, I did a lot and my team's,

1742
01:35:10,911 --> 01:35:11,744
we,

1743
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:16,680
I controlled the release of every single
piece of ordinance in the Marine Corps.

1744
01:35:16,681 --> 01:35:20,840
Hammetry uh, Marine Corps inventory.
So every piece of ordinance that the,

1745
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:24,250
the airport, the Hornets and Harriers
dropped and everything from the hood,

1746
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:28,160
he was in the cobras and artillery. We
called artillery as well. They had a,

1747
01:35:28,190 --> 01:35:29,023
you know,

1748
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:33,050
a field artillery battalion out there
that we did controls from as Anglico I did

1749
01:35:33,051 --> 01:35:37,820
myself. So you know that store,
you know what you get to TBS,

1750
01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:40,070
there's an old saying in the Marine Corps,
we all subscribe to it.

1751
01:35:40,190 --> 01:35:43,610
Every marine is a rifleman and
we are a top gun instructor.

1752
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:48,170
That could not be further from the truth
because the last thing you are as a top

1753
01:35:48,171 --> 01:35:51,620
gun as the training officer at top
gun skiing in Lake Tahoe on a Saturday

1754
01:35:51,621 --> 01:35:56,240
afternoon is a rifleman. But
I will, I will say this, uh,
for the Marine Corps. Yeah,

1755
01:35:56,241 --> 01:36:00,230
I'm biased. I'm a little parochial to
the Marine Corps dude. It's all in there.

1756
01:36:00,670 --> 01:36:04,580
The ocs, TBS, all that exposure, all
that doctrine, everything that you learn,

1757
01:36:04,581 --> 01:36:08,790
it's there now. It took a while to dig
down and find it and those same things.

1758
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:11,150
When I went to ocs and I was the
skinniest guy there and I was scared,

1759
01:36:11,151 --> 01:36:13,790
I couldn't get through it. I'm like,
wait a second, bigger, tougher,

1760
01:36:13,791 --> 01:36:18,050
stronger dudes are doing this or not
doing this. And I am, it's all in there.

1761
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:21,620
And so I just had to figure out how to
tap that stuff again and bring it back up

1762
01:36:21,621 --> 01:36:24,560
and just go do it.
So

1763
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:30,440
great decision near I am in Ramadi getting
after it. And then you guys showed up.

1764
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:31,833
Yeah,

1765
01:36:32,210 --> 01:36:36,260
there was one story you were telling me
that you were calling to fire up and mc

1766
01:36:36,261 --> 01:36:41,060
one and it was your buddy.
Oh yeah. Yeah. We are doing,

1767
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:45,470
um, we're doing what's called movement to
contact my favorite mission as a pilot.

1768
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,900
Nothing better than movement
to contact and a movement,

1769
01:36:47,901 --> 01:36:50,400
conduct mission as you literally, you
drive your Humvees, take all your,

1770
01:36:50,401 --> 01:36:53,750
your folks out and you set up a staging
area in the north side of this, uh,

1771
01:36:54,830 --> 01:36:55,730
this big areas,

1772
01:36:55,731 --> 01:36:59,960
big kind of wooded dirt has like little
ravines and trees and stuff like that.

1773
01:36:59,961 --> 01:37:03,620
And we would just, we would walk
a patrol, I mean you'll have 10,

1774
01:37:03,621 --> 01:37:07,490
15 guys or just go from north to south
and the mission was called move into

1775
01:37:07,491 --> 01:37:10,100
contact.
So you walked until you got in contact,

1776
01:37:10,101 --> 01:37:13,880
which meant you got into a firefight.
And I remember, not the same day,

1777
01:37:13,881 --> 01:37:16,490
but my first day going there, I think
it was Bravo company at two to eight.

1778
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:17,900
I could be wrong,
but I'm pretty sure it was.

1779
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:21,680
And I met the platoon commander for the
first time and I kind of get out of my

1780
01:37:21,681 --> 01:37:23,810
Humvee. I walk up, I'm, I'm looking
for the pertinent commander,

1781
01:37:23,811 --> 01:37:24,860
I'm there as a supporting asset.

1782
01:37:24,861 --> 01:37:27,320
I'm a helpful guy cause I bring
airplanes is going to be good for them.

1783
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:30,740
And he walks up and he's got
a shotgun hanging on his,

1784
01:37:30,860 --> 01:37:35,420
on his kit and you know, I was
a brand new guy, but I, you
know, I was, I'm like, hey,

1785
01:37:35,930 --> 01:37:39,230
hey, what's with the shotgun? You know,
I have a rifle and he's got a rifle.

1786
01:37:39,231 --> 01:37:40,390
He goes, hey, demands with,

1787
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:42,560
I found that this is the best
weapon for these type of missions.

1788
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:47,660
And it turns out he actually was
right on that patrol. Like, dude,

1789
01:37:47,661 --> 01:37:49,880
what am I doing here, man has, you
know, I want to go do a foot patrol,

1790
01:37:49,881 --> 01:37:53,810
the guy with a shotgun. Um,
so I knew that I was in,

1791
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:58,770
there's a lot in store for that. Um,
and we would do these patrols, these,

1792
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:02,340
these move into contacts and you'd end up
in a building. And my job as a fac was,

1793
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:05,040
hey, get out in the building, get
up on top of the roof right away.

1794
01:38:05,370 --> 01:38:09,120
And I would do Overwatch,
you know, similar, different
assets. I had airplanes,

1795
01:38:09,121 --> 01:38:11,370
I had radios, seals, or
do Overwatch all the time.

1796
01:38:11,371 --> 01:38:13,890
And it's just a matter of cover and moves.
I would get up on the roof and go, hey,

1797
01:38:13,891 --> 01:38:16,020
this is what I see. This is
what the airplane sees. Okay.

1798
01:38:16,021 --> 01:38:17,700
You guys jumped to that next building.

1799
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,310
Sometimes the next building
would be 20 yards away,

1800
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:22,380
sometimes it be 200 yards away.
So you were,

1801
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:25,170
you would just do these bounding
movements, building to building.

1802
01:38:25,171 --> 01:38:26,820
And then when they get
to the next building,

1803
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,560
my other guy would be up in the roof.
He said,

1804
01:38:28,561 --> 01:38:32,940
you're going to run down and
go to the next building. Um,

1805
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:39,320
and so we get into this building and as
soon as I get up on top of the roof of

1806
01:38:39,481 --> 01:38:41,430
the building,
so if you can picture it,

1807
01:38:41,431 --> 01:38:42,750
half of us are in the
roof of the building,

1808
01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:45,680
half of the other guys are trying
to move to the other building.

1809
01:38:45,681 --> 01:38:48,960
So they're out in the open and from that
other building as I get up on the roof

1810
01:38:48,961 --> 01:38:53,130
that I looked up and the first thing
that happens is like three RPGs hit the

1811
01:38:53,131 --> 01:38:55,080
building that I'm in
directly underneath me,

1812
01:38:55,130 --> 01:38:58,200
probably probably miss our
team by like 15 feet below us.

1813
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:01,620
So above their heads and below us.
That's the first thing that happens.

1814
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:03,780
And there was a vehicle,

1815
01:39:03,781 --> 01:39:08,010
like a truck and I was a car is like just
some car in between on a let kind of a

1816
01:39:08,011 --> 01:39:12,240
dirt road behind some trees where this
fire came from and we had airplanes

1817
01:39:12,241 --> 01:39:16,290
overhead. It was too fat and
ds. I remember it, um, from
a, uh, an east coast, uh,

1818
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:20,430
Squadron. And, um, you know,
at TBS they teach you, hey,

1819
01:39:20,431 --> 01:39:22,040
every marine is a rifleman and they still,

1820
01:39:22,090 --> 01:39:25,770
they tell you these stories is that one
day you're going to be in a position

1821
01:39:25,771 --> 01:39:29,610
where you're going to be in a firefight
and there's going to be an airplane

1822
01:39:29,611 --> 01:39:32,490
overhead and it's going to be a buddy of
yours from TBS going to your old buddy

1823
01:39:32,491 --> 01:39:34,230
and you're going to be like, hey, Jocko,

1824
01:39:34,231 --> 01:39:37,320
which Dave helped me out and Dave's gonna
roll in on his white horse and come up

1825
01:39:37,321 --> 01:39:38,940
with his horn it and
blast these things out.

1826
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:41,100
And your infantry buddy's
going to thank you.

1827
01:39:41,101 --> 01:39:46,101
One day I'm going to write on Ron was
that I was on the ground and the guy

1828
01:39:47,821 --> 01:39:50,120
flying the airplane was one of my
closest friends, a guy named, uh,

1829
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:51,900
Bu Friedman was the
opposite of the squash.

1830
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:56,370
And I just left and no joke.
I'm like,

1831
01:39:57,430 --> 01:39:59,670
Hey, weren't, we're were UN
troops in contact. You know,

1832
01:39:59,671 --> 01:40:03,870
we're taking fire from wherever.
And on the radio he says, hey chip,

1833
01:40:03,871 --> 01:40:04,710
it's Bu what do you knew?

1834
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:08,070
And it took me right back to TBS and one
the problem was I was supposed to be in

1835
01:40:08,071 --> 01:40:12,240
an airplane when that happened.
And I'm like, I said, uh,

1836
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:16,590
I said south to north
call wings level and, and,

1837
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:19,560
and that's what happened.
And I got four passes from these fat ins,

1838
01:40:19,561 --> 01:40:22,470
did these strafing runs on this car.
And I remember looking at the, uh,

1839
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:26,550
the army guys with us under
the first lieutenant and I
looked at him, I go, dude,

1840
01:40:26,551 --> 01:40:30,330
we're going to be fine. That's like
super cool. Like very chill. Hey,

1841
01:40:30,331 --> 01:40:31,740
this just happened.
I see what's going on.

1842
01:40:31,770 --> 01:40:35,760
There's Hornets overhead had saw
everything. What do you need? I need this.

1843
01:40:35,850 --> 01:40:40,770
We're in the next call is wings level.
Hey, you're cleared hot and you know,

1844
01:40:40,771 --> 01:40:42,070
the hair on my arms standing
up telling the story.

1845
01:40:42,071 --> 01:40:45,090
It's just one of those stories
where the Marine Corps,

1846
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:47,250
for whatever insane reason,

1847
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:50,690
we'll take fat and pallets and train
them millions of dollars in 10 years of,

1848
01:40:50,730 --> 01:40:54,040
of training them and they'll stick
them on the ground. And it's for

1849
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:59,040
that exact reason that that exact event
was I could bring an asset that the army

1850
01:40:59,471 --> 01:41:02,410
would never have an environment that
they would never be able to use.

1851
01:41:03,130 --> 01:41:07,360
And through two buddies just talking
point English to each other on the radio,

1852
01:41:08,050 --> 01:41:11,070
make it happen in like that.
And um,

1853
01:41:12,790 --> 01:41:14,590
I was supposed to be
in that airplane Jocko,

1854
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:17,680
that's how it was supposed to work out.
But in that particular day, a man, it was,

1855
01:41:17,681 --> 01:41:19,870
the roles were reversed, but
it was, it was an awesome,

1856
01:41:20,110 --> 01:41:22,900
it was kind of a culmination of a lot
of things like that. The Marine Corps,

1857
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:26,500
it's a legit, that thing they
breed in us. It's a real thing. Uh,

1858
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:28,020
and it was pretty satisfying
to be honest with you.

1859
01:41:28,210 --> 01:41:32,800
We see that core burn in the ground
and then eventually, I don't know,

1860
01:41:32,801 --> 01:41:37,540
maybe a month or so goes by and we show
up. And who's the first, who did you meet?

1861
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:42,070
First Life? Yup. Lafe uh,
was the first guy that I met.

1862
01:41:42,580 --> 01:41:46,510
Um, actually Lafe and Tony. All
right. Show up together. Um,

1863
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:48,790
so we had seen you guys,
you know,

1864
01:41:48,940 --> 01:41:52,420
W W we had turn over and we were
just kind of getting up to speed.

1865
01:41:52,421 --> 01:41:55,190
We've probably been there maybe a month
or so before you guys had, so you know,

1866
01:41:55,191 --> 01:41:58,270
a quick learning curve ward just
kind of getting comfortable, uh,

1867
01:41:58,271 --> 01:42:00,940
with what's going on. And we also,
there's a new brigade platoon coming in,

1868
01:42:00,970 --> 01:42:05,730
I'm sorry, a new um, uh, uh,
armored division coming into,

1869
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:07,870
we know that the unit that were there,
the two to eight,

1870
01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:09,130
that brigade combat team is leaving.

1871
01:42:09,131 --> 01:42:13,570
We knew new brigade combat team is
coming in and we were actually in just a

1872
01:42:13,571 --> 01:42:14,650
relatively short period of time.

1873
01:42:14,651 --> 01:42:16,930
We're kind of the continuity because
all the old guys are leaving.

1874
01:42:16,931 --> 01:42:18,280
We Ha we had the overlap.

1875
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:21,220
So we had to kind of a prominent role
with the new battalion and the new

1876
01:42:21,221 --> 01:42:24,730
battalion commander. He's retired now. Um,

1877
01:42:24,910 --> 01:42:29,230
awesome dude from a one three, seven arm,
a guy named Tedesco. Just an awesome,

1878
01:42:29,231 --> 01:42:31,440
awesome. Just an awesome
dude. Awesome. Um,

1879
01:42:31,510 --> 01:42:35,200
he had been there as part of its turnover,
had come out a couple of months prior,

1880
01:42:35,860 --> 01:42:40,390
maybe a month prior. And saw us and we
had, my favorite thing about Tabasco is,

1881
01:42:40,810 --> 01:42:42,710
like I said, awesome guy. We,

1882
01:42:42,780 --> 01:42:45,490
we were getting ready to do
a big operation with them.

1883
01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:47,900
I think it was the first time we were
pushing them to south central Ramadi and

1884
01:42:47,940 --> 01:42:50,680
we were in his briefing
and he's quoting pat,

1885
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:56,470
but he's quoting pattern the movie. He's
just kidding. After I was like, yes,

1886
01:42:56,590 --> 01:42:57,490
yes.
Thank you.

1887
01:42:57,700 --> 01:43:01,360
Thank you for bringing me here this day
that he was awesome and he had seen me,

1888
01:43:01,390 --> 01:43:04,980
he just so happened when he was doing
his initial turnover before the, the,

1889
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:09,700
the battalion came out. I had
done, I controlled, uh, uh, um,

1890
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:13,780
a release. I controlled a hell
fire and blew up a car. Uh,

1891
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:16,950
and he got to see it and it was kind of a
cool thing as he come, he was like, who,

1892
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:20,160
you know who these guys, right? I'm
in the middle of doing a real control.

1893
01:43:20,180 --> 01:43:22,630
Happened to be in the COC that day.
Blow up a car.

1894
01:43:22,631 --> 01:43:25,210
It's all in the video would get this
big TV screens that show the whole thing

1895
01:43:25,211 --> 01:43:28,630
and this card detonates and cool
pictures and everything. And he,

1896
01:43:28,690 --> 01:43:30,100
he comes over to me after we're done,

1897
01:43:30,101 --> 01:43:32,590
I'm kind of sitting there and he's a
lieutenant colonel and the major in Sir.

1898
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:35,890
And he's like, can you do that when
we get here? I'm like, absolutely man.

1899
01:43:35,891 --> 01:43:37,870
He's like,
we're going to get along great.

1900
01:43:38,230 --> 01:43:41,200
That was my initial rate interact
with him. So it was awesome.

1901
01:43:41,201 --> 01:43:42,520
And so we knew when they were coming back,

1902
01:43:42,521 --> 01:43:44,860
we had already just to
virtue of that experience,

1903
01:43:44,861 --> 01:43:47,470
built in pretty good inroads with them
and we're going to do some good work.

1904
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:52,040
He was also the type of guy, but there's
this whole brigade team came in that's

1905
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:54,740
5,000 guys, but his battalion,
that group of, you know,

1906
01:43:54,741 --> 01:43:58,070
several hundred was really the core group
that I initially did most of my work

1907
01:43:58,071 --> 01:44:01,730
with. And his approach was, if you
can help us, you're on the team. Yeah.

1908
01:44:02,980 --> 01:44:07,130
There, um, same exact attitude he had with
us. Yeah. For sure. For all the enablers.

1909
01:44:07,131 --> 01:44:10,430
So, uh, they were called the bandits
and they had a little band at Penn.

1910
01:44:10,510 --> 01:44:14,560
I had kind of a skull and crossbones kind
of thing. You are, if you, you were a,

1911
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:18,470
I was a bandit Tisher just totally onboard
the team and he treated us like his

1912
01:44:18,471 --> 01:44:23,450
own guys and that was awesome.
And so, um, all the enablers,

1913
01:44:23,451 --> 01:44:26,750
we had military, we had working dogs,
we had explosive ordinance disposal,

1914
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:28,070
we had Anglico folks.

1915
01:44:28,071 --> 01:44:31,370
We have the seals in all these different
groups from different places that none

1916
01:44:31,371 --> 01:44:33,440
of them were assigned to him.
But his approach was,

1917
01:44:33,441 --> 01:44:36,920
if you can help my soldiers out, you're
on your abandoned, you're on the team.

1918
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:39,350
And everyone was like, right
on, let's do this. Cause that's,

1919
01:44:39,450 --> 01:44:41,930
you needed to work with them anyway,
you might as well make the best of it.

1920
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:47,360
We started to do a couple of missions
and every one of those missions was your

1921
01:44:47,361 --> 01:44:51,400
teams and my teams. Uh, and
I would say probably in the
first week or so, you know,

1922
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:53,810
I'm guessing a little bit of dates,
but relatively quick.

1923
01:44:53,811 --> 01:44:57,620
And the first couple of missions
we are doing the similar things.

1924
01:44:57,650 --> 01:45:00,860
We're bringing support and Overwatch
and helping these guys do their job,

1925
01:45:00,861 --> 01:45:02,750
which is the exact same thing
you guys were doing, you know,

1926
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:07,270
totally different ways. But ultimately
we're supporting these guys. I'm in my,

1927
01:45:07,390 --> 01:45:09,650
my little building there one day,
whatever,

1928
01:45:09,651 --> 01:45:13,400
just sitting around prepping for
something and in walks Lafe and Tony,

1929
01:45:14,450 --> 01:45:17,000
you know, he joined, they drove over from
your base, which is kind of, you know,

1930
01:45:17,001 --> 01:45:19,220
a little bit of a haul around the, around
that are driving. And he goes, hey man,

1931
01:45:19,940 --> 01:45:23,330
um,
loved to work in the morning.

1932
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:26,030
We find a way that we can work together
and some of these missions and we got

1933
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:30,710
this big mission coming up. You want to
come down and, and brief with us. Well,

1934
01:45:30,711 --> 01:45:34,700
yeah, absolutely. I'd love to go
brief with the seals. It'd be awesome.

1935
01:45:34,701 --> 01:45:36,350
I thought it would just be the
kind of cool one time thing.

1936
01:45:36,351 --> 01:45:40,100
I get to see how seals do
business. Um, and that was it.

1937
01:45:40,101 --> 01:45:43,260
That was his introduction had life.
And Tony, I'll be really candid. I,

1938
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:44,510
I'd like to think I would have done that.

1939
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:47,840
I doubt I would've gone to chark based
and knocked on your door and said,

1940
01:45:47,841 --> 01:45:50,030
hey Lafe Jukka let's
do some work together.

1941
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:54,590
He made that initial contact and him and
Tony were definitely equal opportunity

1942
01:45:54,591 --> 01:45:58,250
employers. We at the same thing
as, you know, Colonel Tabasco.

1943
01:45:58,250 --> 01:46:01,880
If we thought someone could do something
to help us out or we could compliment

1944
01:46:01,881 --> 01:46:05,090
each other in any way, man,
we were knocking on doors
to try and make that happen.

1945
01:46:05,091 --> 01:46:09,440
For sure. Yeah. And that was
his approach. Um, I didn't,

1946
01:46:09,580 --> 01:46:12,890
I had never done any work on the ground.
I didn't know much about the seals.

1947
01:46:12,891 --> 01:46:14,390
I'll be very blunt.

1948
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:18,380
I had my own opinion of what I
assumed you guys would be like.

1949
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:21,080
And it was probably something
out of the movies I expected,

1950
01:46:21,081 --> 01:46:25,040
like long beards and do just running
around doing their own thing. Uh,

1951
01:46:25,041 --> 01:46:28,100
and so I was actually a little surprised
that that life came and asked to do

1952
01:46:28,101 --> 01:46:31,850
some work with us. And so I, I went
to that first night and mission, uh,

1953
01:46:32,010 --> 01:46:34,340
that first brief,
I don't want to say I was skeptical,

1954
01:46:34,341 --> 01:46:36,380
but I was certainly interested in what,

1955
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:39,500
because my fear was that you guys
are going to go do your own thing.

1956
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:42,080
And my guys were kind of just
either not be able to keep up,

1957
01:46:42,081 --> 01:46:45,230
not know what you're doing and not fit
in very well and be able to help out and

1958
01:46:45,231 --> 01:46:48,340
just kind of put ourselves at risk.
And

1959
01:46:49,990 --> 01:46:51,690
look, I'll, I'll say this very bluntly,

1960
01:46:52,410 --> 01:46:55,980
I have a very high bar when you leave
top gun on what to expect from a mission

1961
01:46:55,981 --> 01:46:58,020
brief and mission execution
and mission debrief.

1962
01:46:58,021 --> 01:46:59,130
Cause that's what we're all about.

1963
01:46:59,190 --> 01:47:02,370
And I was pretty sure that there's no
chance that you're going to do anything

1964
01:47:02,371 --> 01:47:03,204
anywhere near that.

1965
01:47:03,690 --> 01:47:08,690
And I was shocked and kind of overwhelmed
at how professional your organization,

1966
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:12,600
your team was.

1967
01:47:12,601 --> 01:47:15,390
And that was the biggest thing for me
was what are these guys going to be like?

1968
01:47:15,391 --> 01:47:17,700
I just sort of pictured
a kind of a pickup game.

1969
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,360
It was go there and just kill some bad
guys and come on back and high five each

1970
01:47:21,361 --> 01:47:25,620
other. And Dude, it was one of the most
professional organized mission briefs.

1971
01:47:25,650 --> 01:47:27,090
I totally understood what your plan was.

1972
01:47:27,091 --> 01:47:28,950
I knew exactly where I was going
to fit in. We went and did it.

1973
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:31,860
And then you guys debriefed
after we came back after this.

1974
01:47:31,861 --> 01:47:34,650
It was a relative uninvent nothing really
happened that night. And in terms of,

1975
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:36,400
in the grand scheme of things that we saw,

1976
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:38,730
we were there and then you debriefed it,

1977
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:41,750
you guys came back and you mission
debrief dudes were there kind of clean and

1978
01:47:41,751 --> 01:47:44,280
weapons and tea and going through
and analyzing what happened.

1979
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:48,810
And that was it man. I was
totally on board. I was, I was,

1980
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:53,150
I was sold at that. We could work
together like pretty effectively. Um,

1981
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:54,330
and that was kind of the beginning.

1982
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:57,570
It just sort of started out of the blue
and you guys came down and asked to do

1983
01:47:57,571 --> 01:48:01,290
some good work and, and we did.
You've done a lot of work and it did.

1984
01:48:01,890 --> 01:48:06,140
Your team did a lot of work with us
cause we, we started to think cause,

1985
01:48:06,170 --> 01:48:08,520
cause for our, from our perspective,
and I know, you know, there's one,

1986
01:48:08,570 --> 01:48:12,120
a junior officer out there who's now
probably a lieutenant commander or maybe

1987
01:48:12,121 --> 01:48:14,250
even a commander at this point.
But at that time, you know,

1988
01:48:14,251 --> 01:48:16,720
he was on his first appointment
and he was a [inaudible].

1989
01:48:16,810 --> 01:48:20,640
What we call in the seal teams are air
controllers are called the Jay Tac.

1990
01:48:21,150 --> 01:48:24,930
And so here he is and some of those
missions, instead of being a seal,

1991
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:28,180
he's been a j tech. So he's one
of those guys that looked over it,

1992
01:48:28,190 --> 01:48:29,490
you guys and said,
hey wait a second,

1993
01:48:29,491 --> 01:48:33,600
can you take this radio for me and do
that thing so I can go do my frogman stuff

1994
01:48:33,601 --> 01:48:38,160
over here. And that ad and
plus, again, to be blunt,

1995
01:48:38,820 --> 01:48:42,900
you guys could do it a lot better than we
could, period. You know, we, we, you know,

1996
01:48:42,901 --> 01:48:46,560
you were an f 18 pilot for crying
out loud and we had a new guy,

1997
01:48:46,561 --> 01:48:49,260
junior officer on the radio
trying to call for fire.

1998
01:48:49,261 --> 01:48:54,060
You guys were just imminently better
qualified to do it. And so yeah,

1999
01:48:54,061 --> 01:48:55,260
we looked at it as if,

2000
01:48:55,290 --> 01:48:58,920
okay we that gives us one more shooter
and it gives us a whole new level of

2001
01:48:58,921 --> 01:48:59,670
expertise.

2002
01:48:59,670 --> 01:49:03,600
Now of course there's Jay tax and the
seal teams that they are a lot more

2003
01:49:03,601 --> 01:49:05,610
experience and they're
awesome and of course,

2004
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:10,470
but in our group to bring you guys was
just a huge level up for us to get a lot

2005
01:49:10,471 --> 01:49:15,471
better and give us more people to
maneuver as seals on assaults are on

2006
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:17,970
Overwatch's or whatever.

2007
01:49:17,971 --> 01:49:22,410
So it turned out to be a real
good little little relationship.

2008
01:49:22,411 --> 01:49:26,940
You've got to go in there.
It was a classic when, when
when a, when a seal says,

2009
01:49:27,150 --> 01:49:31,020
Hey, would you control the air so
I can go shoot people, you know?

2010
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:31,920
And that means I'm no,

2011
01:49:31,950 --> 01:49:34,380
I don't have to clear that room and be
in a position where I might have to do

2012
01:49:34,381 --> 01:49:38,250
something like that. I'm all over it and
I, yeah, I know who you're talking about.

2013
01:49:38,610 --> 01:49:40,170
We had,
he and I had a great relationship,

2014
01:49:40,171 --> 01:49:44,110
someone that I really loved working
with who wanted to go be a frog man.

2015
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:47,940
Like you said, I want it to go
control of her plants and uh,

2016
01:49:48,490 --> 01:49:52,300
we found a way to make that
stuff work now. It was,

2017
01:49:53,230 --> 01:49:55,570
it was a big deal for me
though, man. T two for Mike,

2018
01:49:55,750 --> 01:50:00,670
for me and my guys to work with you guys
because you've said this on the podcast

2019
01:50:01,330 --> 01:50:04,450
and I know,
I know how organizations can,

2020
01:50:04,570 --> 01:50:07,210
we're not necessarily parochial
that we don't trust other people,

2021
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:11,650
but we get really comfortable how we do
business and to just bring in another

2022
01:50:11,651 --> 01:50:14,860
group of dudes. I think this also speaks
volumes to desk and all those guys.

2023
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:18,760
You're going to just, you want to make
sure those guys can keep up, you know,

2024
01:50:18,761 --> 01:50:23,710
and everybody knows that you guys are
legit man. And to keep up, you get,

2025
01:50:23,711 --> 01:50:24,460
you'd have to keep up,

2026
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:26,530
you're gonna have to carry your own
weight and you're gonna have to make it

2027
01:50:26,531 --> 01:50:28,090
happen.
You're gonna have to provide something.

2028
01:50:28,091 --> 01:50:30,640
Cause at the minute you become
a drain on the, on the team.

2029
01:50:31,510 --> 01:50:33,400
You know you're going
to get cut loose and we,

2030
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:37,030
we couldn't afford to be a drain on you
and we couldn't afford to have other

2031
01:50:37,031 --> 01:50:40,630
people be a drain on us.
So I think there's a lot of
kind of at the beginning of,

2032
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:43,360
there isn't a lot of reasons
why it wouldn't have worked.

2033
01:50:43,390 --> 01:50:46,810
There's a whole bunch of reasons why it
wouldn't have worked and the only reason

2034
01:50:46,811 --> 01:50:49,360
it didn't work is it everybody was
committed to building a relationship to

2035
01:50:49,361 --> 01:50:53,470
support the battalion. That was it. We
all have the same end state in mind.

2036
01:50:53,471 --> 01:50:56,830
It wasn't about what can the seals do
to be seals and be great at it was what

2037
01:50:56,831 --> 01:50:59,530
can we do to support those guys? What's
the whole thing I was opening up with?

2038
01:50:59,531 --> 01:51:01,000
That's sort of where that came from.

2039
01:51:01,001 --> 01:51:04,750
It's just this attitude that
everybody there was on the same team,

2040
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:09,880
straight up on the same team.
And so then that turned into big missions,

2041
01:51:10,170 --> 01:51:14,110
big missions pushing into Ramadi,
putting in the combat outpost, you know,

2042
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:17,800
night after night, day
after day, doing those,

2043
01:51:17,830 --> 01:51:21,490
those big operations and
that relationship just got,

2044
01:51:22,450 --> 01:51:27,190
just got stronger and stronger. You
know, late Lafe obviously with you and,

2045
01:51:27,730 --> 01:51:30,760
and just turned into something really,

2046
01:51:32,620 --> 01:51:36,670
not just not just cool but man
affective. Yeah, effective.

2047
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:41,880
It was, I mean, in that
deployment I kept a long journal.

2048
01:51:41,881 --> 01:51:45,820
Like I took a lot of notes
on my experience there and
I've gone back and we read

2049
01:51:45,821 --> 01:51:50,080
it a few times and I'm somewhat
recently throughout that whole thing.

2050
01:51:50,410 --> 01:51:52,000
One of the common themes is how

2051
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:55,450
there'll be Lafe and I did this today,

2052
01:51:55,451 --> 01:52:00,340
our t we did stuff with you all the time
and it kind of became in that middle,

2053
01:52:00,341 --> 01:52:02,680
that kind of June, July, August.

2054
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:07,750
I mean that was all we were really doing
because we were so busy and they're,

2055
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:11,030
the big op was kicking off and we were
starting to get into downtown, but,

2056
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:13,510
you know, I guess we'd never been
all these clearings, all that stuff.

2057
01:52:13,511 --> 01:52:18,190
And so the need for us to support the
army in the need for you to support the

2058
01:52:18,191 --> 01:52:19,024
army again,

2059
01:52:19,270 --> 01:52:22,060
we could've had 10 times as many of folks
and we probably still could have done

2060
01:52:22,061 --> 01:52:26,850
more work. Um, everything in that journal
is just about what we're doing together.

2061
01:52:27,010 --> 01:52:30,580
I think at the time I just kind of lost
track of it cause we were just everyday

2062
01:52:30,581 --> 01:52:32,710
get up and go do something.
I mean there was no down days,

2063
01:52:32,711 --> 01:52:34,810
there was hardly ever any time
when we weren't doing anything.

2064
01:52:35,290 --> 01:52:40,210
And it was almost always with
you guys. Um, and it was a
huge highlight for me, uh,

2065
01:52:40,460 --> 01:52:41,293
to,
to,

2066
01:52:42,910 --> 01:52:47,910
to be with a group of guys that were so
on board with just making things happen.

2067
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:54,280
You guys had an incredible knack of this
is in the way or this process keeps it,

2068
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:55,610
yeah,
we got that sorted out.

2069
01:52:56,330 --> 01:53:00,290
Hey I need to get Airpoints oh well you
have to do this and this. No, no, no.

2070
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:01,610
We get,
we get this sorted out.

2071
01:53:01,690 --> 01:53:06,010
So you guys had kind of had cornered the
market on what do you need? We'll make,

2072
01:53:06,030 --> 01:53:08,920
we'll get it, we'll make
it happen. And for me, um,

2073
01:53:09,050 --> 01:53:11,570
to be able to get that asset
sort of delivered that I could,

2074
01:53:12,170 --> 01:53:14,750
and you did all the work to get it,
but I can control the hell out of it.

2075
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:18,290
Right on man. I didn't have to do any of
the work to explain why I needed this.

2076
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:21,260
Cause you guys did all that work
and you had a valid reason for it.

2077
01:53:21,261 --> 01:53:24,260
They would have laughed at me if I said
I wanted an ac one 30 gunship like who

2078
01:53:24,261 --> 01:53:25,094
are you?

2079
01:53:25,330 --> 01:53:29,120
I'm Dave Burke man and I'm like negative
Leif and Jocko need and they see what

2080
01:53:29,150 --> 01:53:32,360
30 gun ship. Not every time, you
know, obviously it was a thin acid,

2081
01:53:32,361 --> 01:53:34,040
but when nothing showed up
overhead and then you get,

2082
01:53:34,070 --> 01:53:36,770
the guy we're talking about is like, you
want to control this? I'm like, yes I do.

2083
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:40,070
I want to control this thing.
So there's a lot of mutual benefit there.

2084
01:53:40,071 --> 01:53:44,150
And I think what we also proved as I
think for the battalion of the brigade,

2085
01:53:44,270 --> 01:53:48,000
they figured out that we were really
helpful in helping those guys accomplish

2086
01:53:48,001 --> 01:53:50,270
what they wanted to accomplish.
And that was just,

2087
01:53:50,271 --> 01:53:53,120
I'm not putting very good
words to it right now, but
as obviously rule rewarding.

2088
01:53:53,121 --> 01:53:56,450
And it was the highlight of that
deployment is our ability to work together

2089
01:53:57,530 --> 01:53:58,311
through,
like I said,

2090
01:53:58,311 --> 01:54:01,080
there's a whole laundry list of reasons
why we shouldn't be able to do this a

2091
01:54:01,081 --> 01:54:03,500
bunch. You didn't work for me.
I did not rank you your guy.

2092
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:06,950
There's just a whole bunch
of institutional roadblocks
that we could just stay

2093
01:54:06,951 --> 01:54:10,040
in our own corners and our own thing and
you and I could have never met and that

2094
01:54:10,041 --> 01:54:13,670
wouldn't have really been
all that uncommon. It would
have just been ops normal.

2095
01:54:14,340 --> 01:54:17,380
Um, and work out man. Yeah,

2096
01:54:18,010 --> 01:54:21,860
a lot of awesome highlights
on that deployment.

2097
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:26,480
And obviously some of the worst
days of our lives are over there.

2098
01:54:29,750 --> 01:54:30,830
June 20th.

2099
01:54:34,890 --> 01:54:39,500
Talk to me about that. Yeah, man. Um,

2100
01:54:39,890 --> 01:54:42,700
so obviously I know we're
going to talk about this. Um,

2101
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:47,480
so we had been there quite a bit and I
remember kind of the shock when we first

2102
01:54:47,481 --> 01:54:51,440
got there talking to the two to eight.
First Day I'm there,

2103
01:54:51,770 --> 01:54:55,760
I go to Alpha Company and they've got
a memorial outside of their compound of

2104
01:54:55,761 --> 01:54:58,070
all the soldiers that have been killed.
I can picture it.

2105
01:54:58,071 --> 01:55:01,040
It's just kind of like a names
are on a little placard in,

2106
01:55:01,041 --> 01:55:06,041
it's kind of a tall little pyramid looking
thing with the names on there and you

2107
01:55:06,291 --> 01:55:09,560
see it, you understand it. Hey,
people have died here. You get it.

2108
01:55:09,590 --> 01:55:13,910
It's not hard to, to understand
that those things have happened,

2109
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:17,060
but there's this a level of disconnect.
When you first get there, you're like, oh,

2110
01:55:17,061 --> 01:55:21,050
people are dying, but you don't, you
haven't seen it. And then, you know,

2111
01:55:21,051 --> 01:55:21,620
very quickly,

2112
01:55:21,620 --> 01:55:25,610
I think probably my second mission out
there was a kind of a QRF from a vehicle

2113
01:55:25,611 --> 01:55:27,660
id. So basically, uh, um,

2114
01:55:28,060 --> 01:55:32,300
in a surgeon with a bunch of bombs in his
vehicles got on between American Combo

2115
01:55:32,301 --> 01:55:36,200
and blew himself up. So I see
my first dead body, you know,

2116
01:55:36,201 --> 01:55:40,700
I see this real combat people are dying
here. It was an enemy wasn't the same.

2117
01:55:42,050 --> 01:55:45,540
And then, you know, March, April, May,

2118
01:55:46,590 --> 01:55:48,500
we started taking, I
mean, not start a week,

2119
01:55:48,510 --> 01:55:51,480
continue to take casualties and I'm
starting to go to memorials and we're

2120
01:55:51,481 --> 01:55:55,500
starting to see guys that we knew and
worked with and were friends with and

2121
01:55:55,501 --> 01:55:56,880
built relationships with.
And they're, they're,

2122
01:55:57,060 --> 01:55:59,310
they're getting killed or
really greatly wounded.

2123
01:56:00,210 --> 01:56:02,850
And those memorials started to become
every couple of days we're going to a

2124
01:56:02,851 --> 01:56:06,000
memorial.
And that sort of weighs on you.

2125
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:08,460
I've thought about this a lot
and how it affected me, you know,

2126
01:56:08,461 --> 01:56:10,860
was a pilot being out of my comfort
zone in this environment and,

2127
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:13,530
and what that was like.

2128
01:56:15,620 --> 01:56:15,780
Okay.

2129
01:56:15,780 --> 01:56:19,050
But without trying to
diminish any of that loss,

2130
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:25,340
there's a, there's a disconnect when it's
not your person when it's not your guy.

2131
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:30,890
And on June 20th so Chris Leon,
who was my radio operator,

2132
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:35,000
we are in a building that we had been
in, let me back up. I was not there.

2133
01:56:35,420 --> 01:56:38,180
I had left that building that morning.
Gone back to the COC.

2134
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:41,660
Adam's team with Chris had replaced us
and we're basically just going back and

2135
01:56:41,661 --> 01:56:42,800
forth operations in this,

2136
01:56:43,070 --> 01:56:46,040
this combat outposts cause it gave us
a really good view of the north part of

2137
01:56:46,041 --> 01:56:49,610
the city. And we had to be
there basically 24, seven and,

2138
01:56:49,670 --> 01:56:54,440
and Chris and Adam team had gone back
out there and they were supposed to go

2139
01:56:54,441 --> 01:56:57,020
from like 12 to four,
something like that on what it was.

2140
01:56:57,021 --> 01:56:58,640
We gave them like a six
hour shift or something.

2141
01:56:58,641 --> 01:57:02,510
And then we're going to kind of figure
out if we replace her start over,

2142
01:57:02,511 --> 01:57:05,960
we had just sort of send them out there
and we're going to come back in a little

2143
01:57:05,961 --> 01:57:10,340
bit and I got a call on the radio
from the battalion saying, Hey,

2144
01:57:10,341 --> 01:57:12,590
can you extend your Anglico
team out here for four hours?

2145
01:57:12,590 --> 01:57:15,800
We're going to go do another movement
to do some clearing again, Roger that,

2146
01:57:15,801 --> 01:57:19,820
Hey Adam, can you guys stay up for an a
couple another couple of hours, you know,

2147
01:57:19,821 --> 01:57:22,180
support, we're going to get Jay or
whatnot, you know, standard answer. Yeah.

2148
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:25,760
Roger that no problem.
And in during that time

2149
01:57:27,980 --> 01:57:31,510
it was not uncommon to take
fire. And from that, in that oop.

2150
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,740
And there were some sniper fire.

2151
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:38,800
And the first shot, uh,
there was a younger marine,

2152
01:57:38,810 --> 01:57:43,310
lance corporal who was up there and Chris
ran up from the other side and kind of

2153
01:57:43,311 --> 01:57:46,580
put, put him down, you know, say, hey,
why don't you get down and take cover, go,

2154
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:51,750
go over to the other side of the building.
And Chris got up to start to, he was a,

2155
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:55,110
he was doing his observation to
try to figure out what's going on.

2156
01:57:55,150 --> 01:58:00,150
And Chris was shot by a sniper
and I get a call can have very,

2157
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:04,140
very closely after that
from Adam. You know, I'm,

2158
01:58:04,141 --> 01:58:07,580
I'm kind of manning the radios all the
time anyway. And even in our home base,

2159
01:58:07,581 --> 01:58:11,210
they're like, where we had a radio right
there. So I was never really not there.

2160
01:58:11,211 --> 01:58:15,620
I was just on the radio and said, hey,
core have been hit. We're on our way back.

2161
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:16,753
And that was about it.

2162
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:19,370
So I didn't have any real good
sense of anything that was going on.

2163
01:58:21,230 --> 01:58:26,030
And I'm a little panic
sets in like, okay. Um,

2164
01:58:26,330 --> 01:58:28,100
and I don't want to press
for too much information.

2165
01:58:28,580 --> 01:58:33,170
I get a call from Alpha company who had
w who manned all the observation posts

2166
01:58:33,171 --> 01:58:36,140
between where he was and where
we were that they were clearing,

2167
01:58:36,141 --> 01:58:37,040
make sure the roads were clear,

2168
01:58:37,041 --> 01:58:39,770
they're using their tanks and Bradleys
so they could pick them up and bring a

2169
01:58:39,771 --> 01:58:42,220
straight shot.
Cause that was a pretty dangerous road.

2170
01:58:42,670 --> 01:58:44,560
You guys had to look out
for ids and stuff like that.

2171
01:58:44,561 --> 01:58:48,220
And so everybody's kind of picking
up the pace to clear out that road.

2172
01:58:48,221 --> 01:58:52,260
And he's coming back and I get
a call, hey, he's breathing. Uh,

2173
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:56,560
we're heading straight to Charlie
med. And I'm like, all right. Okay.

2174
01:58:57,090 --> 01:59:01,150
I kind of had this sense of
this is going to be okay. Um,

2175
01:59:02,890 --> 01:59:05,350
Charlie Med is this
medical facility on the,

2176
01:59:05,370 --> 01:59:08,440
the camp that we were stationed at there
and there's literally a hundred yards

2177
01:59:08,441 --> 01:59:13,060
from where I slept and I just ran down
to Charlie med, uh, to meet the Humvee.

2178
01:59:13,061 --> 01:59:14,990
I was there and I, I'm
sorry, it wasn't a hobby.

2179
01:59:14,991 --> 01:59:19,770
It was a Bradley Bradley Fighting
Vehicle broadly pulls up myself and my,

2180
01:59:19,820 --> 01:59:22,790
my corpsman doc are there, the, the,

2181
01:59:22,890 --> 01:59:26,140
the Bradley has a door on the back of
the amount of that comes down like a ramp

2182
01:59:27,130 --> 01:59:30,550
and the ramp comes down.
He's on a stretcher. Dot.

2183
01:59:30,551 --> 01:59:32,470
Goes up to get the front
piece of the stretcher.

2184
01:59:32,471 --> 01:59:36,550
I'm at the bottom and he comes down
carrying the stretcher and Chris is laying

2185
01:59:36,551 --> 01:59:40,120
on the stretcher and I, he went
right by me. I looked at him,

2186
01:59:40,121 --> 01:59:44,530
I knew immediately that he was
gone. Just, I mean it was gone.

2187
01:59:44,860 --> 01:59:47,440
It was, I could see the entrance wound
at the whole thing was all kind of there.

2188
01:59:47,441 --> 01:59:50,200
They had stabilized and they've done
their best to kind of manage the what,

2189
01:59:50,210 --> 01:59:53,890
but there was no question that the
outcome had already played itself out and

2190
01:59:54,310 --> 01:59:57,960
Chris was gone. They take them
in to the medical facility. Um,

2191
01:59:58,150 --> 02:00:01,570
which I'd been in and you've been in a
dozen times for a whole host of different

2192
02:00:01,571 --> 02:00:04,780
reasons, but it always
been somebody else. I mean,

2193
02:00:04,781 --> 02:00:06,700
I may have known that person
and been close to that person,

2194
02:00:06,701 --> 02:00:11,140
but it was always somebody else.
And doc goes in with him,

2195
02:00:11,141 --> 02:00:14,560
he's carrying the stretcher and he comes
out and probably Juncos play 10 seconds

2196
02:00:14,620 --> 02:00:18,640
and he just comes out with a head shaking.
And I knew I wasn't holding my breath,

2197
02:00:19,390 --> 02:00:21,460
I knew,
but he kinda came out and,

2198
02:00:21,461 --> 02:00:25,120
and just sort of I guess confirmed
if that's the word I'm looking for.

2199
02:00:25,121 --> 02:00:28,330
Just sort of made it official that,

2200
02:00:28,420 --> 02:00:32,290
that Chris had been killed.
And um,

2201
02:00:33,910 --> 02:00:38,350
it sort of initiated just a very
strange kind of very sequence of events.

2202
02:00:38,351 --> 02:00:39,340
So I,

2203
02:00:40,060 --> 02:00:42,730
I knew Adam and the rest of team we're
trying to get back and they're going to

2204
02:00:42,731 --> 02:00:45,580
have a slower road back cause they're
not going to get the support and it just

2205
02:00:45,581 --> 02:00:48,730
going to take a little more time to get
to get their gear and all the things go

2206
02:00:48,731 --> 02:00:52,000
along with that. Chris just got loaded
in a Humvee and racing back in a Bradley.

2207
02:00:52,410 --> 02:00:54,670
They're kind of load up their Humvees
and as it's going to take some time.

2208
02:00:54,671 --> 02:00:57,640
And I know like I need to
get back to the vehicle,

2209
02:00:57,910 --> 02:01:01,570
we park our trucks cause I want to
meet them there. And I walked back,

2210
02:01:01,571 --> 02:01:04,670
like I said, was maybe a hundred
yards from my hooch to Charlie Mann.

2211
02:01:04,671 --> 02:01:07,420
And I get about halfway there
and had this thought that,

2212
02:01:08,740 --> 02:01:12,100
that I maybe didn't confirm
that Chris was killed.

2213
02:01:13,090 --> 02:01:16,090
And so I actually walked
all the way back to go find,

2214
02:01:16,150 --> 02:01:18,220
there's a senior medical officer,
we call it on the snow.

2215
02:01:18,221 --> 02:01:21,370
Really awesome guy that dealt
with all the casualties there,

2216
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:24,700
who I knew because I had done control.
I'd controlled helicopter,

2217
02:01:24,701 --> 02:01:27,880
castle vacs and wounded folks. I've
been there a lot. We did, we gave blood.

2218
02:01:27,881 --> 02:01:29,920
I mean we were in that
facility all the time.

2219
02:01:32,260 --> 02:01:37,060
And I, if I don't know why I
needed to do it, but I was,

2220
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:41,240
I on my, I just, I had to
talk to him that hey is,

2221
02:01:41,370 --> 02:01:45,950
is corporately on as busy as he
killed. And he was like, yeah,

2222
02:01:46,040 --> 02:01:48,500
I'm sorry man. You know, it was
kind of an odd conversation.

2223
02:01:48,501 --> 02:01:50,240
I could tell the why he
was looking at me like,

2224
02:01:50,241 --> 02:01:51,350
why are you asking me this question?

2225
02:01:51,351 --> 02:01:54,530
Like it just was one of those
things that I was in sort of,

2226
02:01:54,531 --> 02:01:57,080
I think it just a stage of disbelief
that as I walked back and I was going to

2227
02:01:57,081 --> 02:01:59,780
deliver the news,
I had sort of told myself like,

2228
02:01:59,810 --> 02:02:03,230
I can't tell them in case what if I'm
wrong because I never really went through

2229
02:02:03,231 --> 02:02:07,970
that. I saw him, I saw doc, but
there are no words were exchanged.

2230
02:02:07,971 --> 02:02:08,291
And I have,

2231
02:02:08,291 --> 02:02:11,660
that's a very odd like walking back
and forth a couple of times and kind of

2232
02:02:12,620 --> 02:02:17,150
sorting it out. And then, you know, my job
was, next thing I had to do is that Adam,

2233
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:19,970
I watched the trucks pull up,
they all get out, you know,

2234
02:02:19,971 --> 02:02:22,740
four guys and everybody else had heard,
you know,

2235
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:24,110
all the angle go teams that were there.

2236
02:02:24,111 --> 02:02:27,290
And we shared a facility with EOD
and working Belize. Everybody,

2237
02:02:27,291 --> 02:02:32,240
you know the word, what's past
was something had happened and I,

2238
02:02:33,170 --> 02:02:37,110
you know, hey, on core dead, um,

2239
02:02:38,030 --> 02:02:39,950
you know,
w we do something called,

2240
02:02:39,951 --> 02:02:43,490
I think it's called a hero flight and a
hero flights going to be at like 1600.

2241
02:02:43,491 --> 02:02:46,720
I got the information in like 10 minutes.
The,

2242
02:02:46,721 --> 02:02:50,150
the process of them
bringing in a casualty,

2243
02:02:50,540 --> 02:02:54,990
that casualty not surviving and then
move in. They had the thing wired. Um,

2244
02:02:55,010 --> 02:02:58,940
and I'd seen it done a bunch of times,
but it just, it was Chris, it was my guy.

2245
02:02:58,941 --> 02:03:01,880
He was a guy that I just knew differently
than everybody else and I just saw him

2246
02:03:01,881 --> 02:03:04,220
differently when we entered our trucks.

2247
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:07,460
He was the back left and I was the front
right. And our trucks are always parked,

2248
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:10,010
backed into their spots so
they're always side by side.

2249
02:03:10,160 --> 02:03:14,960
So the back left of his truck enter door
and the right front of my truck door,

2250
02:03:15,140 --> 02:03:18,460
we always had to fight space
for each other. You know,

2251
02:03:18,980 --> 02:03:22,070
Chris was standard perfect marina.
Like he could be 90% of the way through.

2252
02:03:22,071 --> 02:03:24,200
If he saw me walking up, you'd get out
of the way, close the door to let me.

2253
02:03:24,201 --> 02:03:26,430
And I'm like, oh, come on dude.
Like just here's a great marine.

2254
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:31,190
Just I walked past that kid without
even really talking to him, you know,

2255
02:03:31,191 --> 02:03:34,850
a thousand times, just every single
day, a couple of times a day. And,

2256
02:03:36,020 --> 02:03:38,860
um,
it,

2257
02:03:38,900 --> 02:03:42,350
it demystifies as a,
as a marine,

2258
02:03:44,090 --> 02:03:46,130
you just live a slightly bit for me.

2259
02:03:46,131 --> 02:03:51,131
I shouldn't say you how it felt for me
as I just felt with all that was going on

2260
02:03:51,621 --> 02:03:54,710
and all the destruction and the death
and the violence and all the things that

2261
02:03:54,711 --> 02:03:56,270
I'd sort of become
accustomed to at that point.

2262
02:03:56,780 --> 02:04:01,780
There's just an aspect of it that's just
a tiny bit insulated in your life to a

2263
02:04:01,881 --> 02:04:05,750
really small degree, but it's enough
to just keep you sort of preserved.

2264
02:04:06,980 --> 02:04:10,910
And
when Chris was killed,

2265
02:04:10,911 --> 02:04:12,440
it just sort of expose that.

2266
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:17,500
It broke down one of my last
little boundary of I'm okay here,

2267
02:04:18,081 --> 02:04:21,530
cause I can do this because
I'm going to get through this,

2268
02:04:21,531 --> 02:04:25,540
I'm going to go home and
everything's gonna be okay. Um,

2269
02:04:25,970 --> 02:04:28,460
and that hurt a lot.

2270
02:04:29,300 --> 02:04:34,300
That hurt in ways that I did not
understand how it was going to hurt.

2271
02:04:34,941 --> 02:04:38,580
I just didn't, I just didn't know
what that was going to be like.

2272
02:04:39,870 --> 02:04:43,880
And the, the, the, all of those next steps
and you, I know you know this cause you,

2273
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:44,873
you saw it,

2274
02:04:45,720 --> 02:04:50,400
he's on a helicopter and he's gone flying
away and that 46 and what feels like

2275
02:04:50,401 --> 02:04:55,020
about a minute, it's hours, an hour
even rehearse the movement onto the,

2276
02:04:55,400 --> 02:04:56,540
to carry him onto the hell.

2277
02:04:57,540 --> 02:05:01,800
But you go from Chris's city is on his
way into watching the helicopter fly away

2278
02:05:01,801 --> 02:05:02,411
and it feels like it's,

2279
02:05:02,411 --> 02:05:06,300
it takes about that long and then you're
just sort of left and you walk back.

2280
02:05:06,510 --> 02:05:09,750
You literally walk away from the medical
facility where the helicopter just

2281
02:05:09,751 --> 02:05:12,450
takes off and you walk back a hundred
yards and you just go back to your room.

2282
02:05:13,770 --> 02:05:18,300
Only Chris has gone and it's like
that whole deployment kind of re,

2283
02:05:18,390 --> 02:05:19,650
I don't know what the right word is,

2284
02:05:19,651 --> 02:05:23,190
is like I had to start the deployment
again because all the things that I was

2285
02:05:23,191 --> 02:05:25,380
dealing with and all things and
I was managing and leading as,

2286
02:05:25,420 --> 02:05:28,710
as the leader would know,
whatever you want it to say was my job.

2287
02:05:29,580 --> 02:05:33,070
It all just sort of change in
terms of what I thought really

2288
02:05:36,720 --> 02:05:38,490
the guys that I was working with,

2289
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:41,940
everything was different now because
it was their brother that was gone,

2290
02:05:41,941 --> 02:05:43,170
not somebody else.

2291
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:47,250
And it just sort of changed the calculus
and it really redefined the rest of

2292
02:05:47,251 --> 02:05:49,380
that deployment. And I'll
be really, really blunt.

2293
02:05:50,670 --> 02:05:55,670
It was hard for me to not fold and
there was a lot of instinct of like,

2294
02:05:57,050 --> 02:05:59,250
I did not want to do this anymore.
I do not want to be here.

2295
02:05:59,251 --> 02:06:01,830
This is more than I had bargained for.
And this,

2296
02:06:02,160 --> 02:06:05,460
we can laugh about volunteering
and being a marine, you know,

2297
02:06:06,510 --> 02:06:09,600
it was a little more than I
bargained for. And Look, man,

2298
02:06:10,350 --> 02:06:14,250
we had done some crazy stuff at that
point and I'd seen some bad things happen.

2299
02:06:14,251 --> 02:06:18,120
I was a participant in some
bad things and I had was okay,

2300
02:06:18,121 --> 02:06:22,470
I was doing okay and I was going to be
okay with that. And this one just sort of,

2301
02:06:23,730 --> 02:06:28,320
I just, I struggled with it a little
bit. So it was a tough day man.

2302
02:06:31,510 --> 02:06:36,130
Yeah, it obviously, you know,
for, for us it was, you know,

2303
02:06:36,490 --> 02:06:40,750
what, a month and a half later on
August 2nd when when mark got killed.

2304
02:06:40,930 --> 02:06:43,900
And you know,
I think that's one of the things that,

2305
02:06:44,680 --> 02:06:49,420
that we felt, you know, that little bit
of insulation that you're talking about.

2306
02:06:50,740 --> 02:06:54,310
We felt that we felt,
I will say,

2307
02:06:54,490 --> 02:06:58,330
I would say actually more
insulated because, you know,

2308
02:06:58,331 --> 02:07:01,270
my guys were out there
taking massive risks,

2309
02:07:01,450 --> 02:07:06,450
getting in crazy gunfights getting after
it to a degree that no one had ever

2310
02:07:06,851 --> 02:07:09,400
thought they would.
And we were doing all right.

2311
02:07:09,401 --> 02:07:12,280
We had a couple guys get wounded here
and there, but they were okay. And,

2312
02:07:12,290 --> 02:07:15,010
and honestly, that guy's
getting wounded, you know,

2313
02:07:15,011 --> 02:07:18,760
if it's not a devastating
moment, I mean, it had, you know,

2314
02:07:18,761 --> 02:07:22,120
one of my guys got wounded early on and
he almost lost his leg. But guess what?

2315
02:07:22,121 --> 02:07:26,350
He didn't, and that, that didn't make
us feel more vulnerable in my mind.

2316
02:07:26,440 --> 02:07:30,950
It made us feel stronger and like,
hey, we might get wounded, but what?

2317
02:07:30,970 --> 02:07:34,170
We're going to be good. And so
yeah, when mark got killed and,

2318
02:07:34,171 --> 02:07:35,950
and especially mark was,
you know,

2319
02:07:35,951 --> 02:07:40,951
such a gregarious and such a guy's so
full of life that you don't think he can

2320
02:07:41,951 --> 02:07:44,080
be killed.
You don't think it can be killed.

2321
02:07:44,980 --> 02:07:49,300
And same thing, you know, that
insulation was just completely shattered.

2322
02:07:49,301 --> 02:07:52,660
And I think what was also,
it was, it was recognizable,

2323
02:07:53,110 --> 02:07:56,200
it was recognizable to me,
was that

2324
02:07:58,780 --> 02:08:03,670
other people outside of task me to
bruiser, they thought the same thing.

2325
02:08:03,700 --> 02:08:08,200
They thought, hey, the seals are
here, they're gonna, they're gonna,

2326
02:08:08,740 --> 02:08:10,210
they're gonna push through this.
They're gonna,

2327
02:08:10,390 --> 02:08:14,740
they're gonna win and there nothing's
going to happen to them. And we saw it,

2328
02:08:14,760 --> 02:08:19,330
you know, at the memorial service you
could see in guys faces that they were,

2329
02:08:20,500 --> 02:08:25,500
they were also do their
installation about us was,

2330
02:08:25,690 --> 02:08:28,120
was kind of shattered tune
and then it turns into, damn,

2331
02:08:28,121 --> 02:08:31,900
if the seals can get killed,
where am I at?

2332
02:08:32,700 --> 02:08:35,120
And I think that was another
thing that, that really, you know,

2333
02:08:35,170 --> 02:08:38,020
that was another thing that really
just made market and killed such a,

2334
02:08:38,740 --> 02:08:40,240
such an impact to all of us

2335
02:08:41,620 --> 02:08:43,550
there, there, there's no doubt of that.

2336
02:08:43,580 --> 02:08:45,560
What you just said is
exactly how it played out.

2337
02:08:45,980 --> 02:08:49,360
You were the first guy to talk to me when,

2338
02:08:49,420 --> 02:08:51,620
when Chris has helicopter flies away,

2339
02:08:51,870 --> 02:08:55,430
it's literally like dusty and you know
the helicopters loud and it kicks up dust

2340
02:08:55,431 --> 02:08:59,600
there and it was dark. It was
nighttime. And you came up to me,

2341
02:09:00,170 --> 02:09:01,550
and I don't remember the exact words,

2342
02:09:01,551 --> 02:09:04,220
but we were just turning around and
walking back and you said something like,

2343
02:09:05,600 --> 02:09:08,450
we're going to get after this guys and
we're going to go find the snipers that

2344
02:09:08,451 --> 02:09:11,240
are doing something to those awards.
And it was basically like,

2345
02:09:11,720 --> 02:09:16,660
we're gonna take care of this. And I
remember feeling really comforted by that.

2346
02:09:16,661 --> 02:09:20,630
Like, yeah man, yeah, go
do that. That's awesome.

2347
02:09:20,990 --> 02:09:22,400
And feeling good about that,

2348
02:09:22,880 --> 02:09:26,570
that we weren't helpless and we're just
gonna suck it up and deal with this.

2349
02:09:26,660 --> 02:09:30,650
Just this terrible loss that we're
going to get something from this.

2350
02:09:30,651 --> 02:09:34,340
We're going to go find some guys and go
get after it and we're going to go kill

2351
02:09:34,341 --> 02:09:36,870
these guys. Yes, you got
and you guys were going to,

2352
02:09:36,920 --> 02:09:40,250
you guys are gonna make that happen.
And I remember feeling,

2353
02:09:40,730 --> 02:09:44,600
I remember how that felt and look,
June 20th to August 2nd,

2354
02:09:44,601 --> 02:09:47,990
just like everything else was a blur
man. It was like, it was like the,

2355
02:09:48,020 --> 02:09:51,860
it might as well just been the next day
because things happened so fast there.

2356
02:09:52,280 --> 02:09:57,260
And I was, you know, I wasn't on the
patrol, uh, on the, on August 2nd,

2357
02:09:57,261 --> 02:09:59,630
but I was on the radio.
There's a guy running the air.

2358
02:09:59,631 --> 02:10:01,880
I was doing all the same stuff.
We always did that, you know,

2359
02:10:01,881 --> 02:10:05,630
and I was back in the coc
with you working that mission,

2360
02:10:05,631 --> 02:10:08,180
all that stuff that happened.
And before you know it,

2361
02:10:08,240 --> 02:10:13,220
we're watching the helicopter
fly away. Um, you know, or

2362
02:10:14,750 --> 02:10:17,460
he's gone, you know, and you're,
and you're seeing the, the, the,

2363
02:10:17,540 --> 02:10:18,590
the aftermath of that.

2364
02:10:18,591 --> 02:10:21,740
And I actually went back last night to
look at my journal entry for that day

2365
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:25,340
because I ended up running down to
Charlie met again because that's where

2366
02:10:25,430 --> 02:10:27,660
everybody came in. And I remember
seeing life there. You know,

2367
02:10:27,700 --> 02:10:30,650
life was a guy who worked with a ton
and there he is, he's got a wound.

2368
02:10:30,651 --> 02:10:32,440
I'm looking at it, I'm over it. I'm
standing over his right shoulder,

2369
02:10:32,450 --> 02:10:34,420
that kind of shirt there.
They're there,

2370
02:10:35,830 --> 02:10:40,700
they're attending delay who was life
was a larger than life, you know,

2371
02:10:40,701 --> 02:10:43,820
for a guy like me who always
kind of felt a little bit like,

2372
02:10:43,821 --> 02:10:46,730
what the hell am I doing here, man? What
the hell am I doing with the seals? Like,

2373
02:10:46,731 --> 02:10:49,190
this isn't sane.
These guys are just,

2374
02:10:49,910 --> 02:10:51,950
they're just larger than life.

2375
02:10:51,980 --> 02:10:56,330
And to see the exposure of of that it it,

2376
02:10:56,480 --> 02:11:00,470
it bothered me and I knew I
had the feeling of, holy cow,

2377
02:11:00,500 --> 02:11:01,970
if this can happen to these guys,

2378
02:11:02,930 --> 02:11:05,780
you know it can happen to any of
us and it's not a good feeling.

2379
02:11:05,781 --> 02:11:08,380
And when you saw the guys from the team
who were, it was just, it was just free.

2380
02:11:08,381 --> 02:11:11,240
It was scrambling and it
was just that sense of,

2381
02:11:11,241 --> 02:11:12,990
and I don't want to make it
sound like there wasn't a pinup.

2382
02:11:12,991 --> 02:11:15,380
He's panicking or freaking out.
It was not like that,

2383
02:11:15,950 --> 02:11:18,860
but it was just a tiny bit chaotic,

2384
02:11:18,890 --> 02:11:21,050
if that makes sense on a small degree.

2385
02:11:21,051 --> 02:11:26,051
But enough when you were so used to
just being completely not like that,

2386
02:11:27,290 --> 02:11:32,090
that feeling like when Chris loss
was what I felt was like, Oh man,

2387
02:11:32,091 --> 02:11:35,780
I'm not really in control any of this.
I am not in control.

2388
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:37,280
All that stuff that I've told myself,

2389
02:11:37,281 --> 02:11:41,840
all that comfort and confidence and
we're getting better and I'm going to be

2390
02:11:41,841 --> 02:11:45,170
more effective and do more good
work until this thing is over.

2391
02:11:46,280 --> 02:11:50,960
It was like no negative. That could
be you. That could happen today.

2392
02:11:51,620 --> 02:11:55,940
And then,
and between Chris and mark,

2393
02:11:56,270 --> 02:12:00,110
the army suffered a horned,
God bless.

2394
02:12:00,120 --> 02:12:03,350
We don't go to memorials like every
couple of days people were getting killed

2395
02:12:03,380 --> 02:12:07,160
all the time at every
one of those eroded that,

2396
02:12:07,400 --> 02:12:10,760
that confidence a little bit. And then
when it happened to mark and Lafe,

2397
02:12:11,420 --> 02:12:15,620
that was hard to see that. Um, and it,

2398
02:12:15,680 --> 02:12:20,270
that was the feeling that I
had. I was like, um, yeah,

2399
02:12:21,190 --> 02:12:22,023
yeah,

2400
02:12:23,540 --> 02:12:27,830
maybe I'm just lucky, you know, maybe,
and maybe this whole thing is just luck.

2401
02:12:28,360 --> 02:12:30,080
Um,
now look,

2402
02:12:32,810 --> 02:12:36,680
we, we regrouped. I mean, June 20th,

2403
02:12:36,681 --> 02:12:39,600
it was a bad day. You know,
we did all the things we do,

2404
02:12:39,601 --> 02:12:43,480
the more oil we paid our are, we honored
him the right way. You guys came out.

2405
02:12:43,490 --> 02:12:48,080
We did it the right way and we
acknowledged, uh, Chris, um,

2406
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:52,190
but if you kind of think of what's going
on in Ramadi in the middle of June, man,

2407
02:12:52,191 --> 02:12:55,490
there was no taking a knee. There was
no like, let's hold off for a second,

2408
02:12:55,491 --> 02:12:58,460
catch our breath, the bullet train, which
is running. And as a matter of fact,

2409
02:12:58,461 --> 02:13:00,360
it was just going to, it was actually
just going to get a ton worse.

2410
02:13:00,361 --> 02:13:04,850
So you remember July and August were
just, they were insane. They were insane.

2411
02:13:04,851 --> 02:13:08,300
So we, we lost Chris really at
the big ramp up. Right. You know,

2412
02:13:08,301 --> 02:13:11,390
we had done a big movement in earlier in
June and we were really starting to lay

2413
02:13:11,391 --> 02:13:15,860
into the city. But the real, you
know, the crazy j block, you know,

2414
02:13:15,861 --> 02:13:19,280
that kind of stuff, that stuff
was all out in front of us. Um,

2415
02:13:20,060 --> 02:13:21,530
and so for me it was,
you know,

2416
02:13:21,531 --> 02:13:24,140
my entire career I've done a whole bunch
of really great stuff on my career.

2417
02:13:24,260 --> 02:13:25,093
Nothing has even,

2418
02:13:25,460 --> 02:13:29,690
nothing is even is any more talking
about what anything else in my career has

2419
02:13:29,691 --> 02:13:33,450
meant compared to that deployment.
And then that day, I mean,

2420
02:13:33,451 --> 02:13:37,080
it's just light years
different. Um, and it was like,

2421
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:38,833
hmm,

2422
02:13:39,390 --> 02:13:41,460
you got to get up and go do it the
very next day. And it's a four.

2423
02:13:41,461 --> 02:13:42,840
I remember going that first patrol,

2424
02:13:42,841 --> 02:13:47,430
that first mission and trying to
is that feeling of, okay, yeah,

2425
02:13:47,431 --> 02:13:50,340
it's different. And you got,
I think you've got one or
two ways to go with that.

2426
02:13:50,341 --> 02:13:52,980
It's either going to get inside your
head and kind of mess with you and break

2427
02:13:52,981 --> 02:13:56,760
you a little bit, and I could feel
that happening or you just, you just,

2428
02:13:57,870 --> 02:14:02,370
you just don't, you just shut
it down and just go do it. Um,

2429
02:14:02,760 --> 02:14:06,210
and I found how to compartmentalize.
You know, I'd come back,

2430
02:14:06,211 --> 02:14:08,790
I'd have moments when I was back on
my hooch up on the roof by myself.

2431
02:14:08,791 --> 02:14:12,440
I have my moments, man. No, I don't
want anybody to think that I didn't. Uh,

2432
02:14:12,570 --> 02:14:15,180
I had plenty of those moments. As
a matter of fact, I, I still do.

2433
02:14:15,270 --> 02:14:17,190
To be honest with you,
I still have my moments.

2434
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:19,350
I go visit Chris and
Arlington on his birthday.

2435
02:14:19,380 --> 02:14:22,230
I go visit Chris in the day he was killed.
I go to go visit Chris Memorial Day.

2436
02:14:22,740 --> 02:14:26,670
His mom comes out, I see cat.
She and I are very close.

2437
02:14:27,500 --> 02:14:30,660
Um, I have my moments without a doubt. Um,

2438
02:14:30,780 --> 02:14:34,980
but the rest of the three months
in Ramadi that it was just not,

2439
02:14:35,340 --> 02:14:39,930
there wasn't a ton of time to do that. So
I guess I kinda just saved it maybe, uh,

2440
02:14:39,950 --> 02:14:44,190
for, for when I came back and it
was their minute. It's not good.

2441
02:14:45,240 --> 02:14:49,410
But um, yeah man. So

2442
02:14:50,670 --> 02:14:54,120
then you do come back and I
mean obviously like you said,

2443
02:14:55,080 --> 02:14:59,460
it ramped up, it ramped up all
the time and the guys were just,

2444
02:15:00,300 --> 02:15:02,700
you know, everybody, Larry, I'm
not just talking about our guys.

2445
02:15:02,701 --> 02:15:07,490
I'm talking about everybody. It ramped
up hardcore. It got hotter outside the,

2446
02:15:07,491 --> 02:15:12,150
the, the combat got more intense,
the enemy started fighting harder.

2447
02:15:12,210 --> 02:15:15,000
They got more squared away.
And

2448
02:15:17,720 --> 02:15:18,553
like you said,

2449
02:15:18,680 --> 02:15:23,680
you and the rest of the guys there
did the mission day after day,

2450
02:15:25,470 --> 02:15:26,340
night after night,

2451
02:15:26,790 --> 02:15:31,020
and then one day you fly home.

2452
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:32,673
Yup.

2453
02:15:34,170 --> 02:15:39,170
And how was that transition
for you getting back to yeah,

2454
02:15:40,040 --> 02:15:43,700
the states. Uh, interesting.

2455
02:15:44,190 --> 02:15:45,950
It was an interesting transition.
So

2456
02:15:47,630 --> 02:15:52,450
from the time that I left Ramadi, so you
would pack up our stuff. We left for,

2457
02:15:52,580 --> 02:15:57,350
I think we went to Kuwait for a day or
two. Went to Le Jeune, went to Japan,

2458
02:15:57,440 --> 02:16:01,010
cause I had a checkout at both places.
Jack,

2459
02:16:01,011 --> 02:16:05,040
I think it was six days on the calendar
from the day I left for the today I did

2460
02:16:05,100 --> 02:16:08,150
the day I landed on a plane in San Diego.
Um,

2461
02:16:08,720 --> 02:16:11,000
which at the time was all I wanted.
I was the,

2462
02:16:11,150 --> 02:16:14,750
and I've been fairly good about this
throughout my career is when I want things

2463
02:16:14,751 --> 02:16:19,190
to happen administrative, we, I can
make those things happen by him getting,

2464
02:16:19,220 --> 02:16:22,760
if I catch one that there's a flight
from Japan to San Diego and I can get on

2465
02:16:22,761 --> 02:16:24,480
that flight,
I'm going to get on that flight.

2466
02:16:24,481 --> 02:16:26,910
And even with my CEO is yell at me like,
how did you get out of here so fast?

2467
02:16:26,910 --> 02:16:29,910
And like I have this thing in the guy and
the paper I got to go and I'm out. Um,

2468
02:16:30,280 --> 02:16:31,780
I wanted to get out quickly.
Uh,

2469
02:16:31,781 --> 02:16:36,280
so I found myself in San Diego
executing my next orders,

2470
02:16:36,281 --> 02:16:38,000
which the Marine Corps had said,
you go to [inaudible],

2471
02:16:38,001 --> 02:16:39,700
you do the it factor
and go to do the factor,

2472
02:16:39,730 --> 02:16:42,730
you're going to go back to San Diego
from there, which will be your,

2473
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:43,711
your next set of orders.

2474
02:16:43,711 --> 02:16:47,050
So I knew while I was in Iraq
that San Diego was in my future.

2475
02:16:47,051 --> 02:16:48,190
My wife had already moved down there.

2476
02:16:48,460 --> 02:16:50,710
I told you she was living
with my best friend Neil,

2477
02:16:50,711 --> 02:16:55,660
who was on that factor before me. So I
go in Ramadi, his battalion comes home,

2478
02:16:55,661 --> 02:16:59,980
we show up. My wife and my best friend
are living together in San Diego. Uh,

2479
02:17:00,130 --> 02:17:04,930
which was really good for her because
he was able to kind of keep her aware of

2480
02:17:04,931 --> 02:17:05,501
what's going on,

2481
02:17:05,501 --> 02:17:09,700
but knew exactly how to explain it in a
way that wasn't going to freak her out.

2482
02:17:10,240 --> 02:17:13,390
And he also, to be honest with, you
know, how to downplay, I would call, hey,

2483
02:17:13,391 --> 02:17:14,920
we're doing this. No big
deal. I mean, I didn't,

2484
02:17:15,790 --> 02:17:18,070
I wasn't telling them half of what
the hell was going on. I, we can't,

2485
02:17:18,130 --> 02:17:19,270
you're not going to share those stories.

2486
02:17:19,271 --> 02:17:21,310
So he was a really great resource for her.

2487
02:17:21,790 --> 02:17:24,790
I paid very little time worrying about it,
to be honest with you.

2488
02:17:24,791 --> 02:17:28,580
I was comfortable that, that she
had a good support structure, um,

2489
02:17:28,720 --> 02:17:32,740
which she really didn't.
We, we got married, uh,

2490
02:17:32,830 --> 02:17:35,030
I deployed for months later to Ramadi.
She,

2491
02:17:35,031 --> 02:17:37,780
she started dating a dude who was driving
a corvette and living in Tokyo as a

2492
02:17:37,781 --> 02:17:40,690
top gun instructor and informants
after we got married, I was in Ramadi,

2493
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:44,560
so there was no like easing.

2494
02:17:45,100 --> 02:17:49,420
So I knew there was just, I didn't
know at the time I didn't think of it,

2495
02:17:49,421 --> 02:17:52,660
but it was obvious that looking back
that she was just thrown into an

2496
02:17:52,661 --> 02:17:57,520
environment that she was
totally unprepared for that
forget about just me being

2497
02:17:57,521 --> 02:17:59,800
gone. But just the fact that I was
in Ramadi, it's all over the news.

2498
02:17:59,801 --> 02:18:00,491
Everybody who was going on,

2499
02:18:00,491 --> 02:18:02,710
I think one of my marines is killed
in a lot of crazy stuff going on.

2500
02:18:02,711 --> 02:18:03,221
And next thing you know,

2501
02:18:03,221 --> 02:18:08,221
I'm home September 20th I'm back in
San Diego like 365 days to the day.

2502
02:18:10,480 --> 02:18:13,660
I'm home and I checked
into an Fatz squash.

2503
02:18:13,661 --> 02:18:17,450
And like the day after I got home before
October 1st I was back anyone Fatz

2504
02:18:17,470 --> 02:18:21,820
squash and San Diego, which is insane. Um,

2505
02:18:23,320 --> 02:18:28,210
and I, to be really
blunt, I was, you know,

2506
02:18:28,211 --> 02:18:32,570
all those guys in Angola went back to
Anglico and Campbell are zoon in camp, uh,

2507
02:18:32,690 --> 02:18:36,940
Hanson and, and Japan. I was like, wait,
later Bros, you know, like no longer buys,

2508
02:18:36,941 --> 02:18:39,850
you know, high five great
deployment. Uh, you know, I'm out.

2509
02:18:40,060 --> 02:18:44,170
I was just on to other things and I kind
of extricated myself. It's, you know,

2510
02:18:44,171 --> 02:18:46,210
I followed the rules to do whatever's
supposed to do and before I know it,

2511
02:18:46,211 --> 02:18:48,700
I'm back there.
And I honestly,

2512
02:18:48,701 --> 02:18:52,820
I think also kind of kicking myself like
that was the be the best thing for me.

2513
02:18:52,821 --> 02:18:53,770
Let's,
let's get home.

2514
02:18:54,100 --> 02:18:59,020
I knew something was amiss because
on the drive home from the airport,

2515
02:18:59,021 --> 02:19:03,070
I fly to San Diego international
just down the road. My wife and my,

2516
02:19:03,220 --> 02:19:05,170
my mom who lives in San Diego,

2517
02:19:05,171 --> 02:19:06,670
both of them saying it came to
pick him up from the airport.

2518
02:19:06,671 --> 02:19:07,960
You've already met my mom.
Great Lady.

2519
02:19:08,350 --> 02:19:10,600
My wife and my mom picked
me up from the airport.

2520
02:19:10,630 --> 02:19:12,400
I got pictures of them meeting
me there and get in the car,

2521
02:19:12,401 --> 02:19:17,401
drive from San Diego International to
our house in Pacific beach and as repoing

2522
02:19:18,670 --> 02:19:22,180
like onto Chels Sydney up to the house.

2523
02:19:24,150 --> 02:19:28,520
Um, I like screamed at him and told him
to stop talking or something like that.

2524
02:19:28,940 --> 02:19:31,430
I said something like, I don't even
know. I don't know what it was,

2525
02:19:31,431 --> 02:19:35,970
but I think I just remember sitting in
the passenger seat and some the gears are

2526
02:19:35,971 --> 02:19:39,230
just start, I'm in a truck or a car,
whatever. I don't know what it was,

2527
02:19:39,231 --> 02:19:42,050
but something's going on in. And I think
just the pressure is building and um,

2528
02:19:42,250 --> 02:19:44,600
and I have no sense of what's going on.
No alet for it.

2529
02:19:44,810 --> 02:19:49,810
And they're like having a perfectly normal
adult conversation that might've been

2530
02:19:49,940 --> 02:19:53,780
an octave above what I was willing
to accept or tolerate maybe.

2531
02:19:54,200 --> 02:19:57,710
And I completely freaked out on my
wife and my mom went and seen in a year

2532
02:19:59,300 --> 02:20:02,450
and you know, they were like,
oh, sorry, you know, they
were super cool, no pushback.

2533
02:20:02,510 --> 02:20:06,300
And I was, it was an indicator
like, yeah, you're right.

2534
02:20:06,460 --> 02:20:10,010
You recognize that immediately.
You're like, Oh God, Yep. Immediately.

2535
02:20:10,310 --> 02:20:14,810
And it was that combination
recognition of that's not good.

2536
02:20:15,500 --> 02:20:17,150
And clearly I have,

2537
02:20:17,510 --> 02:20:20,810
I have things I need to deal with that
I wasn't quite aware of. So a new,

2538
02:20:21,140 --> 02:20:23,900
no question right away.
And I think, you know,

2539
02:20:23,901 --> 02:20:26,800
think about this a lot
with other marines and,

2540
02:20:26,801 --> 02:20:29,480
and the things he experienced in combat.
And you've talked about PTSD a lot. Look

2541
02:20:30,980 --> 02:20:32,210
as a subject you'd spend hours on.

2542
02:20:32,211 --> 02:20:34,070
The bottom line is everybody
deals with things differently.

2543
02:20:34,190 --> 02:20:36,230
It doesn't mean you're
broken or messed [inaudible].

2544
02:20:36,380 --> 02:20:39,020
It just means you have some processes
you got to go through and you gotta deal

2545
02:20:39,021 --> 02:20:40,580
with.
And we all deal with it differently.

2546
02:20:41,480 --> 02:20:46,160
I had maybe talked myself into how
it's 33 as a fairly experienced guy.

2547
02:20:46,161 --> 02:20:51,161
I was surrounded by very young marines
who maybe in my mind didn't have maybe

2548
02:20:51,861 --> 02:20:54,280
the emotional, uh, maturity,

2549
02:20:54,290 --> 02:20:57,740
maybe the life skills to maybe manage
some of these same chaotic things.

2550
02:20:57,741 --> 02:20:59,990
You know, guys that saw
Chris gets shot, you know,

2551
02:21:00,620 --> 02:21:02,420
I may be kind of built
myself up a little bit.

2552
02:21:02,421 --> 02:21:06,650
I was a little better equipped and I was
better equipped in my mind and I was,

2553
02:21:06,710 --> 02:21:10,490
I in a matter of 45 minutes
from the airport to the house,

2554
02:21:10,550 --> 02:21:13,850
I'm flying off the handle
on something. So, um,

2555
02:21:15,320 --> 02:21:17,630
it just all it was, man, it was,

2556
02:21:17,660 --> 02:21:21,530
it was those two things like that's not
good and this is gonna probably happen

2557
02:21:21,531 --> 02:21:23,660
again. I'm going to need to, I'm
going to do to think about this.

2558
02:21:24,080 --> 02:21:27,710
I can't pretend like I'm not going
to just have some sort of residual,

2559
02:21:27,711 --> 02:21:28,970
you can't leave Ramadi,

2560
02:21:29,110 --> 02:21:31,870
be in San Diego six days later and
not bring some baggage home with you.

2561
02:21:31,871 --> 02:21:34,670
And I was bringing some baggage home.
Um,

2562
02:21:35,750 --> 02:21:39,510
and there were some baggage
there a little bit. Uh,

2563
02:21:40,370 --> 02:21:44,770
so that transition was, was it started?
Is there anything that like the,

2564
02:21:44,850 --> 02:21:47,300
anything that helped you? Yeah, Dude.

2565
02:21:47,301 --> 02:21:50,270
I'll tell you what helped the most is my
best friend who had been in Ramadi and

2566
02:21:50,450 --> 02:21:55,130
endured all of that loss.
Look our story. You know, the,

2567
02:21:55,260 --> 02:21:57,020
the guys that we replaced,
the guys that replaced us,

2568
02:21:57,021 --> 02:22:01,270
it's a very similar story a lot.
They understand that, you know,

2569
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:03,390
I think having an outlet,
having one other dude,

2570
02:22:03,391 --> 02:22:06,290
and it happened to be my best
friend, super 14. So it was,

2571
02:22:06,860 --> 02:22:10,250
you want to talk about just hitting the
Jackpot on being the best equipped to

2572
02:22:10,251 --> 02:22:13,420
sort of just deal in power through
it and accept what's going on and,

2573
02:22:13,460 --> 02:22:15,470
and embrace it and all of those
things that go along with it.

2574
02:22:15,770 --> 02:22:18,050
I had an outlet man.
I had my best friend who knew,

2575
02:22:18,080 --> 02:22:22,100
I mean he knew every place we were. I
mean it wasn't even like, oh he was here.

2576
02:22:22,290 --> 02:22:26,730
It was the same place. Cause Ramande not
that big. It's just not that big man.

2577
02:22:26,790 --> 02:22:29,820
And so he say, I was on the corner of
sunset and Michigan. He's like, yeah,

2578
02:22:29,830 --> 02:22:33,450
been there a hundred times. Yeah. Um, and,

2579
02:22:34,230 --> 02:22:38,250
and he was struggling a bit to, you
know, again, it's all relative. I mean,

2580
02:22:38,251 --> 02:22:41,220
were handled relatively okay.
You know,

2581
02:22:41,221 --> 02:22:43,080
I'm going back to kind of
dealing in a normal life and,

2582
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:46,620
but the moments when you get those little
spikes and those is what kind of comes

2583
02:22:46,621 --> 02:22:49,860
up and get you those little spikes.
Those are unperceived kind of reactions.

2584
02:22:50,340 --> 02:22:53,190
He could see that in me and I could see
that in him and we actually been real.

2585
02:22:53,191 --> 02:22:57,390
We're really good for each other.
When I see him kind of get a little shaky,

2586
02:22:57,391 --> 02:22:58,770
a little break, like I'm not, you know,

2587
02:22:58,771 --> 02:23:01,290
he's not digging his environment a
little bit or he'd see that in me.

2588
02:23:01,590 --> 02:23:05,640
You had that other person that kind
of bring you back to helping you,

2589
02:23:05,790 --> 02:23:09,810
helping you to deal with that, which
is good. The flip side of that,

2590
02:23:09,811 --> 02:23:11,970
while it was really helpful
for him to be there,

2591
02:23:13,170 --> 02:23:17,340
I think it was really tough on Whitney
because she was not my outlet for that.

2592
02:23:17,490 --> 02:23:20,490
I wasn't kind of got cut out
totally and not at, I didn't,

2593
02:23:20,670 --> 02:23:23,520
certainly not by design. I'm not like
doing this calculation of I don't want my,

2594
02:23:24,300 --> 02:23:27,210
she just not, I'm not going to use
her as a resource, you know, for that.

2595
02:23:27,211 --> 02:23:28,200
And to be honest with you too,

2596
02:23:28,201 --> 02:23:31,230
there's also a little part of me know
what the corner of Michigan and sunset is

2597
02:23:31,231 --> 02:23:35,610
like. So totally man. And I'll,
I'll be really candid, you know,

2598
02:23:37,110 --> 02:23:40,920
I think I would have been almost
embarrassed is maybe not the right word,

2599
02:23:40,921 --> 02:23:45,090
but I wasn't, I don't know if I
wanted her to see that pirate party,

2600
02:23:45,300 --> 02:23:46,050
you know what I mean?
Like,

2601
02:23:46,050 --> 02:23:49,380
and they check out this ridiculous amount
of vulnerability that I have right now

2602
02:23:49,410 --> 02:23:52,350
that I'm going to carry with me for God
knows how long that's going to come up

2603
02:23:52,351 --> 02:23:55,410
out of nowhere and you're going to have
to just deal with it. So there was a,

2604
02:23:56,280 --> 02:23:59,490
I think the thing that bothered me the
most and was part of just kind of getting

2605
02:23:59,491 --> 02:24:03,780
back to day to day life was it,
I would get when things didn't go well,

2606
02:24:03,781 --> 02:24:06,600
when I had my moments, my reaction
was just I just get pissed off.

2607
02:24:06,870 --> 02:24:10,810
It was that feeling of I have
this like some event, what happen?

2608
02:24:10,820 --> 02:24:14,460
Something stupid would catch my attention
and kind of heighten my, you know,

2609
02:24:14,461 --> 02:24:17,490
my response.
And because it happened,

2610
02:24:18,060 --> 02:24:21,360
I'd be in order to myself that I let it
let it bother me and that'd be pissed

2611
02:24:21,361 --> 02:24:23,640
off at myself because I let it bother me.
You know what I mean?

2612
02:24:23,641 --> 02:24:27,540
Like this ridiculous cycle of, I
told you the story the other day, um,

2613
02:24:28,290 --> 02:24:29,140
my wife and I shoot,

2614
02:24:29,160 --> 02:24:32,850
I guarantee she remembers
the store or walking across
the street downtown. No, no.

2615
02:24:33,060 --> 02:24:35,220
By the beach I think.
And A,

2616
02:24:35,221 --> 02:24:39,310
an auto body shop is running the air
drill to pull some tires off of can route,

2617
02:24:39,360 --> 02:24:42,810
you know that, that kind of
sound. And as we're walking,

2618
02:24:43,530 --> 02:24:46,950
I think my left arm is over her,
her shoulder were walking like this.

2619
02:24:47,220 --> 02:24:50,430
I hear that sound and my first reaction
is I pushed her down to the ground.

2620
02:24:51,150 --> 02:24:55,260
And in the time that it takes
to do that and catch that,

2621
02:24:55,261 --> 02:24:59,370
it's happening is maybe a
third of a second. You know
what I mean? So I hear it,

2622
02:24:59,400 --> 02:25:03,240
I do the eye, I'm reacting
and pushing her to the ground.

2623
02:25:03,270 --> 02:25:08,010
I'm kind of getting on top of her to
do, look what a two, oh, that's the car.

2624
02:25:08,100 --> 02:25:09,060
It's not a thing.

2625
02:25:09,300 --> 02:25:11,850
There's no reason for you to do
this is about a third of a second.

2626
02:25:11,880 --> 02:25:15,060
And what bothered me the most
about it is that I did it.

2627
02:25:15,120 --> 02:25:18,270
Not that I felt like that is that I
reacted to it and I was like embarrassed,

2628
02:25:18,300 --> 02:25:22,650
like what's wrong with me to go through
that? And she's like, what the, you know,

2629
02:25:23,170 --> 02:25:26,120
and um, I, it sounded like, you know,

2630
02:25:26,150 --> 02:25:28,770
kind of going through the whole
thing and I think just the, the,

2631
02:25:28,950 --> 02:25:32,950
the fact that I had responses pissed me
off and I would just kind of, honestly,

2632
02:25:33,250 --> 02:25:35,140
I have a temper about it and that was,

2633
02:25:35,410 --> 02:25:38,140
she got to see me just get pissed
off at stuff for no real good reason,

2634
02:25:38,141 --> 02:25:42,730
which you never really get
pissed off. Like, I mean,

2635
02:25:42,940 --> 02:25:45,150
I have tempers, a pet,
just stuff that just did,

2636
02:25:45,490 --> 02:25:48,130
I would get mad about stuff that
just didn't make sense. I mean,

2637
02:25:48,610 --> 02:25:52,090
I have a temper about things that when I
get my computer pisses me off just like

2638
02:25:52,091 --> 02:25:55,660
it pisses you off man. And that's
totally normal. Right. I would get,

2639
02:25:55,780 --> 02:25:58,930
I would have reactions to stuff that
just, there was no way for her to say, oh,

2640
02:25:58,931 --> 02:26:02,620
that makes sense. I understand. It
would just be this totally odd ball.

2641
02:26:03,640 --> 02:26:05,340
Somebody would say something wrong.
Just,

2642
02:26:05,380 --> 02:26:08,380
it would just trigger in ways that she
would look at me and kind of be like,

2643
02:26:08,381 --> 02:26:12,100
who are you? She knew all my flaws. She
knows everything right in along with me.

2644
02:26:12,340 --> 02:26:14,110
And all of a sudden now I'm
doing all this other stuff.

2645
02:26:14,120 --> 02:26:16,780
Put another little thing in
the, yes, add that to the mix.

2646
02:26:16,781 --> 02:26:21,010
So I got my wife who we get
married, I leave, I go on
this deployment, I come back,

2647
02:26:21,011 --> 02:26:25,510
I'm home for maybe seven months before
I deployed again in that seven months,

2648
02:26:26,050 --> 02:26:29,530
you know, welcome to marriage
to Dave Burke. You know,

2649
02:26:29,531 --> 02:26:33,310
that involves a year long deployment,
seven months in Iraq, you know,

2650
02:26:34,240 --> 02:26:36,100
God only knows what the Hell I
was. You know, I'm back to work.

2651
02:26:36,101 --> 02:26:38,470
So I'm back at a squadron as the Xo,
you know,

2652
02:26:38,471 --> 02:26:42,160
working ridiculous XO hours in a
fighter squadron prepping up to go on a

2653
02:26:42,161 --> 02:26:42,994
deployment.

2654
02:26:43,220 --> 02:26:47,830
I voluntarily extend my
time to make the deployment,

2655
02:26:48,250 --> 02:26:51,190
which is exactly what you should do
at the beginning of your marriage is

2656
02:26:51,191 --> 02:26:54,970
volunteer to extend on a deployment.
I got accepted into Grad school,

2657
02:26:54,971 --> 02:26:56,140
I was going to go to Dartmouth,

2658
02:26:56,680 --> 02:26:59,290
I was getting out of the Marine
Corps is going to go to get my Mba.

2659
02:27:00,190 --> 02:27:04,590
And I remember the conversation of Hey,
I'm going to extend.

2660
02:27:04,620 --> 02:27:06,400
It asked me to extend and you know,

2661
02:27:06,700 --> 02:27:09,760
explaining why I was going to do what I
was going to do. And she was like, why?

2662
02:27:09,820 --> 02:27:13,150
Why would you do that? And
I said, so I can deploy.

2663
02:27:14,050 --> 02:27:17,920
And you hear those words like God,
I just say that to my wife. Like,

2664
02:27:19,420 --> 02:27:23,180
which is so I cannot be with you so I
can be apart from you so I can hang out

2665
02:27:23,181 --> 02:27:26,350
with the boys and go do that. You know
what I mean? Not Retired from the marines.

2666
02:27:26,510 --> 02:27:29,200
Get Out of the Marine Corps so I can
not do all these other things that I not

2667
02:27:29,201 --> 02:27:32,140
set up this future that I told you
all about and sold you on it. Totally.

2668
02:27:32,740 --> 02:27:36,820
So to say that my wife and,
and everybody's got those stories,

2669
02:27:37,390 --> 02:27:40,300
the laundry list of reasons why she
should have just sort of cut bait and be

2670
02:27:40,301 --> 02:27:41,080
like,
no,

2671
02:27:41,080 --> 02:27:45,400
this is not happening is a lot longer
than the list of reasons why she shouldn't

2672
02:27:45,401 --> 02:27:45,970
have.

2673
02:27:45,970 --> 02:27:50,740
And props were good where she is
here and my marriage with her,

2674
02:27:50,980 --> 02:27:53,860
uh, you know, for all the ups and downs,
it goes long as everybody's marriage.

2675
02:27:54,100 --> 02:27:57,850
The one thing I don't worry about,
even even when we're at our worst,

2676
02:27:57,910 --> 02:28:00,910
at our absolute worst, which
are worst, is whatever it is,

2677
02:28:00,911 --> 02:28:03,160
we have our worst moments
at our absolute worst.

2678
02:28:03,670 --> 02:28:06,520
I don't have a shred and we
have a brain cell of thought of,

2679
02:28:06,880 --> 02:28:09,300
I wonder if our marriages are going to
survive this. You know, this throw down,

2680
02:28:09,330 --> 02:28:11,110
we're having over,
God knows what you know.

2681
02:28:11,200 --> 02:28:14,170
So we kind of went through
the fire there and she,

2682
02:28:15,640 --> 02:28:18,880
she got forged. Yeah, big
time. She's a stud. Uh,

2683
02:28:18,910 --> 02:28:22,610
she deserves mad props for going through
that because I'm not really sure why

2684
02:28:22,611 --> 02:28:26,390
she did, to be honest with
you. She said, no, I can't.

2685
02:28:26,391 --> 02:28:28,190
I can't come up with
any good reasons either.

2686
02:28:29,570 --> 02:28:32,990
She had a lot of options on the table.
I'm not sure. Uh, yeah, so it was,

2687
02:28:33,530 --> 02:28:37,070
that transition was tough man.
So now you're in another squadron.

2688
02:28:37,110 --> 02:28:39,670
You go on deployment again,
which is another one.

2689
02:28:39,671 --> 02:28:41,720
What are you doing on that deployment?
Just more so.

2690
02:28:41,721 --> 02:28:44,370
I'm back in FAA squash and
I'm the Xo and the opposite.

2691
02:28:44,400 --> 02:28:46,820
I actually did both jobs on this
deployment and we just go to Japan.

2692
02:28:46,821 --> 02:28:48,380
It's a Westpac,
so western Pacific.

2693
02:28:48,381 --> 02:28:53,120
We're back in CUNY and a and
Okinawa just doing exercises,

2694
02:28:53,390 --> 02:28:55,730
exercises or training, that kind
of stuff. Get done with that.

2695
02:28:55,940 --> 02:28:58,250
And so now maybe it's time to
get out of the Marine Corps.

2696
02:28:58,280 --> 02:29:00,950
Before I left and that deployment,
I had told my commander,

2697
02:29:00,951 --> 02:29:03,410
the the group commander and the squadron
commander, Hey, this isn't for me.

2698
02:29:03,411 --> 02:29:05,060
I'm hanging it up.
It's been awesome.

2699
02:29:05,061 --> 02:29:08,210
I happily to extend for this deployment
that they needed me to go on.

2700
02:29:08,211 --> 02:29:11,780
It was great experience. I got to train
a bunch of young guys. Life was good,

2701
02:29:12,050 --> 02:29:14,600
but they knew before I left that I was
going to be out of the Marine Corps.

2702
02:29:14,960 --> 02:29:17,390
At the end of that I differed
at Dartmouth for a year,

2703
02:29:17,540 --> 02:29:20,150
paid my nonrefundable deposit,
which I have never gotten back.

2704
02:29:20,580 --> 02:29:23,840
It wasn't why they call it not fundable.
Absolutely.

2705
02:29:25,130 --> 02:29:27,350
My point is I wasn't kicking
around the idea of getting out.

2706
02:29:27,650 --> 02:29:31,430
I was in full execution. We had looked
at houses like we are in execution.

2707
02:29:31,431 --> 02:29:36,431
This was merely a detour to get to that
end state and what I'm due back from

2708
02:29:36,951 --> 02:29:41,480
that deployment in January,
I think it is of the following year and

2709
02:29:43,430 --> 02:29:45,830
it turns out that the
Marine Corps wants to uh,

2710
02:29:45,900 --> 02:29:48,290
extend a guy to go fly f 20 twos for the,

2711
02:29:48,370 --> 02:29:53,370
with the air force for three years and
they're accepting applications for the f

2712
02:29:53,451 --> 02:29:57,110
22 raptor exchange, which had never been
happened before. Never happened since.

2713
02:29:57,111 --> 02:30:01,640
It was a onetime thing and the
guy got it, they picked, you know,

2714
02:30:01,641 --> 02:30:05,150
it was going to go to non deploying
in Nellis and fly the have 22 raptor.

2715
02:30:06,830 --> 02:30:07,880
I should probably apply.

2716
02:30:07,881 --> 02:30:11,330
I guess it just seems like a reasonable
thing to do because then if they say no,

2717
02:30:11,331 --> 02:30:15,170
then we'll just go get my
MBA. It's all good. Um,

2718
02:30:15,560 --> 02:30:18,680
and Lo and behold, uh,
at the end of December,

2719
02:30:18,681 --> 02:30:22,070
I get the word that I got picked
up for this raptor exchange. Um,

2720
02:30:23,150 --> 02:30:26,890
and I, you know, I remember calling
Whitney, I'm like, hey babe,

2721
02:30:29,570 --> 02:30:34,220
totally. She knows what's up. And I
did the standard Dave Burke oversell.

2722
02:30:34,290 --> 02:30:38,180
Hey, no deploying. We're
going to go to, you know, it's
all, here's all the goodness.

2723
02:30:38,181 --> 02:30:41,930
There's no downside, you know, and
she's like, shut up. You know, she's a,

2724
02:30:41,980 --> 02:30:43,970
and she was good with it and
you know, it was a, it was,

2725
02:30:45,260 --> 02:30:48,050
it was just another one of those
things. Like, I can't say no to this.

2726
02:30:48,051 --> 02:30:50,960
This is just something that doesn't
happen and you just don't get to,

2727
02:30:50,990 --> 02:30:51,890
nobody gets a fly.

2728
02:30:51,891 --> 02:30:55,960
They have 22 in the Marine Corps because
the merger was a plan of 20 twos,

2729
02:30:56,030 --> 02:30:58,640
same thing I said when I've left sixteens
and top gun and all this sort of stuff.

2730
02:30:58,640 --> 02:31:03,410
So it was just another thing that I just
couldn't believe was happening and I

2731
02:31:03,411 --> 02:31:06,800
couldn't leave the Marine Corps saying I
walked away from that. I just couldn't.

2732
02:31:06,950 --> 02:31:11,860
And she was totally on board and came
home and didn't get back my nonrefundable

2733
02:31:11,870 --> 02:31:16,870
deposit and a move to Vegas and started
flying the have 22 raptor three years up

2734
02:31:17,421 --> 02:31:20,640
there. And then at some
point that role was oh yeah.

2735
02:31:21,150 --> 02:31:24,870
And that rolls into the f three,
five at some point. So I, I'm fine.

2736
02:31:24,871 --> 02:31:29,040
[inaudible] um, how many people
were flying the f 22 at this point?

2737
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,370
So we probably had,

2738
02:31:32,880 --> 02:31:35,130
I knew at the time what number I was,

2739
02:31:35,131 --> 02:31:39,240
I think I might've been in the
hundreds something, you know,

2740
02:31:39,241 --> 02:31:43,170
we had two squadrons that
were stood up and you know,

2741
02:31:43,171 --> 02:31:43,951
and it was starting to pick up,

2742
02:31:43,951 --> 02:31:47,580
the pace was early 2008 so the raptor
was just starting to get its legs

2743
02:31:47,581 --> 02:31:50,370
underneath it. We started building more
and it was starting to become a thing.

2744
02:31:50,640 --> 02:31:52,260
And the Marine Corps had this
idea that they're going to,

2745
02:31:52,470 --> 02:31:55,020
they're going to build this new stealth
airplane called the f 35 and they are

2746
02:31:55,021 --> 02:31:55,854
going to get it.

2747
02:31:56,010 --> 02:32:00,060
And they wanted someone to go to the
air force to learn all the airplanes are

2748
02:32:00,061 --> 02:32:01,050
really similar.
There's a goal,

2749
02:32:01,230 --> 02:32:04,710
steal all their experience and all the
pain that they've gone through to stand

2750
02:32:04,711 --> 02:32:07,230
up this thing and then you're going
to bring it back to the Marine Corps.

2751
02:32:07,231 --> 02:32:10,860
So the deal was this f 22 Gig was,
it was really high probability.

2752
02:32:10,861 --> 02:32:13,470
I was gonna go right from the of 22
to the of 35 and command the first

2753
02:32:13,500 --> 02:32:17,850
operational squadron. And Lo and behold,
man, that's exactly what happened.

2754
02:32:17,910 --> 02:32:18,750
We went to Tyndall,

2755
02:32:18,751 --> 02:32:23,640
we lived in Tyndall for three months
when I went through training and that was

2756
02:32:23,641 --> 02:32:24,940
awesome.
We're living on the beach in,

2757
02:32:24,941 --> 02:32:27,600
in Florida for three months to get
trained in the raptor when we move out to

2758
02:32:27,601 --> 02:32:32,160
Vegas. Um, lived there for three
plus years, started a family too.

2759
02:32:32,161 --> 02:32:36,900
My first two kids were born in Las Vegas.
We're, we're killing it, man. I mean,

2760
02:32:36,901 --> 02:32:39,600
it was awesome.
And as I'm getting ready to leave Vegas,

2761
02:32:40,320 --> 02:32:44,760
I get selected to command the first
operational. There was a guy there before,

2762
02:32:44,761 --> 02:32:47,370
they didn't have airplanes, they had a
guy, there was another CEO before me,

2763
02:32:47,371 --> 02:32:51,570
but I was going to go out there and
accept and start flying the first f 35 of

2764
02:32:51,571 --> 02:32:54,510
the Marine Corps. I show up and this poor
guy was selected to do the same thing,

2765
02:32:54,540 --> 02:32:57,960
you know, two years prior.
Great Dude. But he, you know,

2766
02:32:57,961 --> 02:33:01,170
we'd stayed in touch and I were always
in contact and helping them stand up with

2767
02:33:01,171 --> 02:33:04,230
everything. And, and I get
there, Jocko, I'm there,

2768
02:33:04,260 --> 02:33:08,790
I think two days and the first airplane
showed up and I'm like, what's the,

2769
02:33:09,780 --> 02:33:11,560
what's the big deal?
He spent two years in,

2770
02:33:11,590 --> 02:33:15,180
see a single airplane working
all this paperwork, grinding,

2771
02:33:15,181 --> 02:33:17,730
doing all this administrative stuff
to prep. He gets no airplanes.

2772
02:33:17,731 --> 02:33:19,230
You show up two days later,
boom.

2773
02:33:19,350 --> 02:33:22,150
Do the amount of work that him and
his guys went through to stand up the

2774
02:33:22,151 --> 02:33:25,440
squadron. And I literally showed
up at to work in the next day.

2775
02:33:25,441 --> 02:33:29,130
The first airplane landed. Yeah. That's
my new nickname for you. You're like,

2776
02:33:29,550 --> 02:33:31,230
this really isn't that hard,
van, what's the big deal?

2777
02:33:31,650 --> 02:33:36,420
And he and I did a turnover and
he left and sort of flying up 35.

2778
02:33:37,190 --> 02:33:42,150
Um, and you know, that's a whole part of
my career. We could spend hours on that.

2779
02:33:42,151 --> 02:33:44,430
But I flew the raptor,

2780
02:33:44,431 --> 02:33:47,760
which was an amazing airplane and I flew
the up 35 which was amazing airplane

2781
02:33:47,761 --> 02:33:51,480
and I, and I got to totally
be relevant in aviation.

2782
02:33:52,050 --> 02:33:55,680
I had sort of exhausted. I did all
the things I wanted to do in a hornet.

2783
02:33:55,770 --> 02:33:58,560
I love that airplane. I did top can,
I kind of had reached all the things,

2784
02:33:58,590 --> 02:34:02,100
and we talked about this too,
when when you leave top gun,

2785
02:34:03,090 --> 02:34:05,370
you're never going to
be that good ever again.

2786
02:34:05,460 --> 02:34:09,900
So it was just a matter of how slow you
can make the process of getting worse.

2787
02:34:09,930 --> 02:34:14,580
It's just how can you slow it down to
be as good as you can knowing that you

2788
02:34:14,581 --> 02:34:17,010
will never be as good as you
were there because you're,

2789
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:20,620
you're never going to get the reps again
ever. You're just never going to get it.

2790
02:34:20,860 --> 02:34:23,680
And so it's just a matter of kind
of slowing down that process.

2791
02:34:23,681 --> 02:34:24,910
And at some point in your mind,
like,

2792
02:34:24,940 --> 02:34:28,210
I don't want to be in this business
if I'm not at the top of my game.

2793
02:34:29,950 --> 02:34:33,860
When I flew the of 22 I didn't
have a job. I didn't, I wasn't,

2794
02:34:34,240 --> 02:34:35,470
I wasn't the opposite of a squadron,

2795
02:34:35,471 --> 02:34:37,870
which is what I just showed up and
I just show up and flew the plane.

2796
02:34:37,871 --> 02:34:40,630
I had some leadership responsibility
in, in the organization, showed up,

2797
02:34:40,690 --> 02:34:44,890
grab the keys from someone, take
it out, run it into the ground,

2798
02:34:44,891 --> 02:34:46,960
write a little report and be like,
bring your bag again.

2799
02:34:46,990 --> 02:34:50,050
The keys back to the maintenance guys
and yeah, hey, this thing's broken.

2800
02:34:50,330 --> 02:34:54,550
Give me another one. Um, it was
your deal day. It was awesome. Yeah.

2801
02:34:54,551 --> 02:34:58,340
So I did that totally
great for my marriage.

2802
02:34:58,580 --> 02:35:01,480
I was able to combine all these
professional interests with great,

2803
02:35:01,720 --> 02:35:04,390
which you don't get to do in the Marine
Corps when there's a war going on.

2804
02:35:04,810 --> 02:35:07,800
You just don't get to do that.
And here I am and do.

2805
02:35:07,840 --> 02:35:10,960
I had no more friends in the
Marine Corp Man. Nobody liked me.

2806
02:35:11,410 --> 02:35:14,980
They're all doing back to back to back
deployments and airplanes are breaking

2807
02:35:14,981 --> 02:35:18,940
and um, I'm living in Vegas, fly on
the rafter. All my bros were like,

2808
02:35:18,941 --> 02:35:22,870
we're done with you, man. We've got
nothing for you. So, you know, I was just,

2809
02:35:23,020 --> 02:35:27,930
I almost felt guilty. I did not feel
guilty, but it almost did. Almost did a,

2810
02:35:27,950 --> 02:35:30,770
and then I go out to, and we moved
to Destin, Florida, you know, or,

2811
02:35:30,780 --> 02:35:33,850
or Fort Walton beach and we'll live in
Knightsville and this awesome house in

2812
02:35:33,851 --> 02:35:34,541
this great community.

2813
02:35:34,541 --> 02:35:39,190
And I was the first pilot to ever fly
the F 35 be operationally in the world.

2814
02:35:39,610 --> 02:35:44,350
Like ridiculous. I did that for like
two and a half years and it was awesome.

2815
02:35:44,650 --> 02:35:48,530
And then you, what
brought you up to DC? Um,

2816
02:35:49,060 --> 02:35:50,680
so what rob got to DC.
So I was,

2817
02:35:51,250 --> 02:35:53,940
I was so sure that I was going to leave
the Marine Corps after that command tour

2818
02:35:53,941 --> 02:35:57,100
or they have 35 that I reapplied to.
Dartmouth got back in again.

2819
02:35:57,480 --> 02:36:01,300
It got accepted to, do you have to give
him another deposit? Um, no, I was,

2820
02:36:01,330 --> 02:36:04,510
I was smart enough not to pay the
deposit because there's a tiny little

2821
02:36:04,511 --> 02:36:07,340
possibility that wasn't gonna
work out. Anyway, I did get
into Dartmouth again. It,

2822
02:36:07,350 --> 02:36:09,940
it's like, Babe, I'm going to go to get
my Mba. I've always wanted to get my MBA.

2823
02:36:10,780 --> 02:36:11,740
And um,

2824
02:36:12,550 --> 02:36:17,550
I got selected for an academic fellowship
where it basically got to go to Grad

2825
02:36:18,761 --> 02:36:19,810
School for a year.

2826
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:22,630
I went to and said they sent me the Johns
Hopkins University to get my masters

2827
02:36:23,590 --> 02:36:26,740
and I basically went to DC and
it was a civilian for a year.

2828
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:31,150
Between those two things is
another terrible deal. It's like,

2829
02:36:31,240 --> 02:36:31,721
can the Marine Corps,

2830
02:36:31,721 --> 02:36:35,500
I'd like to pay you to go be a fulltime
student at Johns Hopkins, which,

2831
02:36:35,590 --> 02:36:37,390
which they did.
Um,

2832
02:36:37,450 --> 02:36:42,010
so we moved up to DC and I went to Johns
Hopkins and got my masters and then the

2833
02:36:42,011 --> 02:36:45,520
next thing they offered
you is to go back and yeah.

2834
02:36:45,520 --> 02:36:50,520
So from there the payback of that
good deal was to go to the Pentagon,

2835
02:36:50,980 --> 02:36:53,410
which was totally reasonable thing.
I post command,

2836
02:36:53,411 --> 02:36:54,700
I had been to school and you know,

2837
02:36:54,900 --> 02:36:58,540
it's certainly couldn't complain about
how tough my life was in the Marine Corps

2838
02:36:58,541 --> 02:37:01,650
since, you know, the last eight
years or whatever. It was a,

2839
02:37:01,660 --> 02:37:05,100
and I just went basically did a desk
job in the Pentagon, uh, and uh,

2840
02:37:05,130 --> 02:37:07,950
worked for and the Joint Staff and the
chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff and

2841
02:37:07,951 --> 02:37:11,230
just working some project. It wasn't all
that exciting. It was, I learned a bunch,

2842
02:37:11,231 --> 02:37:15,100
but it was just kind of a kind of a
mad job. I was, you know, very nine,

2843
02:37:15,170 --> 02:37:18,380
five strict hours. Don't take
work home. We know blackberry,

2844
02:37:18,381 --> 02:37:22,880
no real responsibility. Pretty
chill life. Life was pretty good.

2845
02:37:23,120 --> 02:37:27,170
Um, I selected, I picked up
colonel while I was there. Um,

2846
02:37:27,860 --> 02:37:32,090
the end of 2015,
I was selected for colonel and uh,

2847
02:37:32,120 --> 02:37:33,380
in the summer of 2016,

2848
02:37:33,381 --> 02:37:38,381
I selected for command again as a
colonel this time to command and have 35

2849
02:37:38,391 --> 02:37:39,224
squadron.

2850
02:37:40,300 --> 02:37:42,250
Um,
but

2851
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:44,150
I didn't want to do that.

2852
02:37:45,050 --> 02:37:47,810
I don't know how this is going to come
across to the people listening and what a

2853
02:37:47,811 --> 02:37:49,280
terrible dealer was.
The marine corps acid,

2854
02:37:49,281 --> 02:37:53,070
would it be a curl and go flap 35
is again, and I'm not, I'm not,

2855
02:37:53,720 --> 02:37:57,170
I don't want this to come across
it. I was complaining, but what I,

2856
02:37:58,400 --> 02:38:02,480
the one thing that I, and all those great
deals in, dude, they were great deals.

2857
02:38:02,660 --> 02:38:07,110
The thing that I was missing the most
was that I always kind of felt like I had

2858
02:38:07,111 --> 02:38:10,160
a one foot in one foot out.
They were these non deploying jobs,

2859
02:38:10,161 --> 02:38:13,850
the air force exchange. Um, the,

2860
02:38:13,851 --> 02:38:17,870
the FPT five job was kind of standing up
a squadron and we weren't prepping for

2861
02:38:18,080 --> 02:38:19,760
anything and I loved it,

2862
02:38:19,761 --> 02:38:23,840
but I could feel sort of
underneath the surface,

2863
02:38:26,760 --> 02:38:30,330
like a lack of investment.
I could tell I just wasn't,

2864
02:38:30,780 --> 02:38:33,960
I didn't have to be a hundred set
pot committed because there was no,

2865
02:38:33,961 --> 02:38:36,220
we're going to go to deploy,
we're going to go to,

2866
02:38:36,660 --> 02:38:38,220
there was no thing that
was going to happen.

2867
02:38:38,280 --> 02:38:40,440
And I think one of the healthiest
things about being in the Marine Corps,

2868
02:38:40,441 --> 02:38:41,940
you're always prepping for something.
Yeah.

2869
02:38:42,390 --> 02:38:44,760
So even in the crappy stuff you
don't want to do, you know, hey,

2870
02:38:44,761 --> 02:38:49,761
we got to do this because the end state
is this and I was missing that and it

2871
02:38:49,831 --> 02:38:53,070
sort of over time started to erode a
little bit that I did is I was catching

2872
02:38:53,071 --> 02:38:57,460
myself. I know in the we'll slack in
the line, to be honest with you, I,

2873
02:38:57,940 --> 02:39:02,050
to be really blunt, I didn't have to
bring my a game every day. I just didn't,

2874
02:39:02,110 --> 02:39:05,680
I could do the things that I was doing
so in an airplane because there was just

2875
02:39:05,681 --> 02:39:08,830
an element that there was no
outcome to what I was preparing for.

2876
02:39:09,550 --> 02:39:11,200
And I started to kind
of find other interests.

2877
02:39:11,201 --> 02:39:14,350
Like school became
really interesting to me.

2878
02:39:14,560 --> 02:39:16,900
I did that year and so I
continued my education,

2879
02:39:16,901 --> 02:39:20,290
Johns Hopkins and started working towards
my Mba because I needed something or

2880
02:39:20,291 --> 02:39:21,550
wanted something else.

2881
02:39:22,360 --> 02:39:26,710
And once you kind of catch in your mind
that the Marine Corps and what they're

2882
02:39:26,711 --> 02:39:27,580
asking you to do.

2883
02:39:27,581 --> 02:39:29,740
I was going to go back to a training
squash and I wanted to go to be an

2884
02:39:29,741 --> 02:39:32,300
operational commander with
operational units that are praying,

2885
02:39:32,350 --> 02:39:34,090
preparing to go something.
I wasn't going to get to do that.

2886
02:39:34,090 --> 02:39:37,900
I was going to go back to a training
environment. I caught myself

2887
02:39:39,610 --> 02:39:44,260
losing the thing that was
the most passionate about
the marine corps and seeing

2888
02:39:44,261 --> 02:39:45,880
it's more of like, okay, three years here,

2889
02:39:45,881 --> 02:39:47,770
this will get me to this retirement
and this amount of money,

2890
02:39:47,771 --> 02:39:52,300
and it was just starting to become a
little too professional and not enough

2891
02:39:52,330 --> 02:39:54,760
about a passion. And I don't
mean to say I was going to need,

2892
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:56,460
needed to feel like a 21 year old again.
I I,

2893
02:39:56,520 --> 02:40:00,140
you don't need to recreate it like that.
But my wife actually sat me down.

2894
02:40:00,170 --> 02:40:02,230
We were talking and she just kind
of looked at me and he's like, dude,

2895
02:40:03,820 --> 02:40:06,910
you're not going to be happy doing this.
It was really clear to her,

2896
02:40:06,911 --> 02:40:08,590
I think even more clear
than it was for me.

2897
02:40:08,950 --> 02:40:13,560
It's hard to come across as ungrateful,
but I

2898
02:40:15,030 --> 02:40:15,640
okay,

2899
02:40:15,640 --> 02:40:16,120
I could,

2900
02:40:16,120 --> 02:40:18,820
I was not going to be good at that job
because there was something that was

2901
02:40:18,821 --> 02:40:22,300
missing. It was something that I didn't,
there was nothing that I about it,

2902
02:40:22,301 --> 02:40:27,040
that it made me feel passionate about
doing it. So no joke, man. Last year,

2903
02:40:27,070 --> 02:40:31,340
August, I basically told
her I declined command,

2904
02:40:31,670 --> 02:40:33,980
I declined promotion and to put them
for retirement all the same day.

2905
02:40:35,300 --> 02:40:39,110
And that was a big move,
man. It's a big move.

2906
02:40:39,410 --> 02:40:44,370
That created a little splash out
there in the world. Maybe. Uh,

2907
02:40:44,570 --> 02:40:48,110
it was, it didn't, it surprised everybody.

2908
02:40:48,111 --> 02:40:50,300
But my wife obviously
she was totally got it.

2909
02:40:50,301 --> 02:40:53,150
I knew it was the right thing
and my closest buddies, I
mean I talked to my Bros,

2910
02:40:53,160 --> 02:40:56,060
my tight, my Bros, those
guys understood. But yeah,

2911
02:40:56,061 --> 02:41:01,061
it was a big move and I was turning
down what by whole by all rights was a

2912
02:41:01,221 --> 02:41:04,300
really good, great deal. Another
great deal. Doubt about it. But,

2913
02:41:04,660 --> 02:41:09,660
and then at some point you show up at a
different kind of event in Virginia with

2914
02:41:12,620 --> 02:41:17,240
Lafe and I working with a company
for our company Ashkelon Front,

2915
02:41:17,330 --> 02:41:20,630
we're doing a leadership
training for a company.

2916
02:41:21,170 --> 02:41:24,320
And you decided to come down
and check it out. Lay said,

2917
02:41:24,321 --> 02:41:29,170
come on down and check this out. See
what you think of this. Yeah. So life.

2918
02:41:29,580 --> 02:41:32,990
Talk to me a couple of years ago and when
I was leaving that f 35 dropped before

2919
02:41:32,991 --> 02:41:36,470
I went up to DC and he's like, Hey
man, Jack and I are doing this thing.

2920
02:41:36,471 --> 02:41:40,910
It's going to be awesome. Um, we'd love
to talk to you about it. And I'm like,

2921
02:41:40,911 --> 02:41:43,310
Hey man,
I'm all in on this other gig.

2922
02:41:43,370 --> 02:41:47,690
I'm going to school and go to the Marine
Corps. And we stayed in touch. I mean,

2923
02:41:47,691 --> 02:41:50,440
life was a buddy. I mean, he's
a guy that that I appreciate it.

2924
02:41:50,490 --> 02:41:53,150
You have the Times that we reconnected
here and there and I certainly

2925
02:41:53,151 --> 02:41:55,520
appreciated the call, but it just
really wasn't in the calculator.

2926
02:41:55,560 --> 02:42:00,380
I wasn't really, I wasn't there.
So when I told him like, hey man,

2927
02:42:00,381 --> 02:42:05,000
I dropped my letter, uh, I'm
getting out. Um, and like I said,

2928
02:42:05,001 --> 02:42:08,240
life isn't always the easiest guy to get
ahold of right away to talk sometimes.

2929
02:42:08,241 --> 02:42:11,600
He's, he's got a lot on his
plate as a busy guy. And he
texted, he texted me back,

2930
02:42:11,610 --> 02:42:14,150
right then I'm on the bus
leaving the Pentagon is a, Hey,

2931
02:42:14,151 --> 02:42:18,740
do you have time to talk right now? Yeah,
I knew. So he calls me and we talked for,

2932
02:42:18,741 --> 02:42:22,760
I mean, probably a solid 45 minutes
to an hour. And he's like, Hey,

2933
02:42:22,820 --> 02:42:26,450
jack and I are going to be up in
Vienna here in a couple of weeks.

2934
02:42:26,451 --> 02:42:31,070
Why don't you come out for
the day? I'm like, okay. Right
on. And He, and he gave me,

2935
02:42:31,130 --> 02:42:34,100
you know, I like, I was following
you guys and I knew it was going on.

2936
02:42:34,101 --> 02:42:35,810
I was seeing what you're doing
and things were blown up.

2937
02:42:35,811 --> 02:42:37,080
I was certainly bragging on my,

2938
02:42:37,100 --> 02:42:40,760
my buddy's Leif and Jocko to anybody
that will listen to me about it. Um,

2939
02:42:40,940 --> 02:42:43,090
and I watched you, you
know, you and laugh,

2940
02:42:43,100 --> 02:42:46,940
give this presentation up there
in Vienna to this group. And um,

2941
02:42:49,060 --> 02:42:52,560
dude
you were,

2942
02:42:52,840 --> 02:42:56,020
it was awesome man who were sitting with
a smile on your face when we, you know,

2943
02:42:56,040 --> 02:43:00,010
we got done and that first
day and we sat down with you,

2944
02:43:00,130 --> 02:43:04,630
you were in big town. You're
like I am in, I want to do this,

2945
02:43:04,780 --> 02:43:08,800
this is all you were. You were pumped.
And then I think that was, you know,

2946
02:43:08,920 --> 02:43:12,070
and then, and then actually
we did, I brought you up and

2947
02:43:12,070 --> 02:43:16,690
we did an event with another company
and that you're now involved with for a

2948
02:43:16,691 --> 02:43:21,670
long term and, and even then, you know,
cause then cause then for us, you know,

2949
02:43:21,671 --> 02:43:24,280
I wanted to see what you are going to
do and see how you are going to do it.

2950
02:43:24,281 --> 02:43:26,950
And Man, I was like, I don't know,

2951
02:43:26,951 --> 02:43:30,730
you gave your first two
paragraphs of talking, you know,

2952
02:43:30,731 --> 02:43:34,750
your first two minutes of, of explaining
something. I was like okay cool, I'm good.

2953
02:43:35,230 --> 02:43:39,940
And I was, you know, just everything that
we talk about all the time, you know,

2954
02:43:39,941 --> 02:43:44,941
that's in the book and
hearing you describe things
from the book but with your

2955
02:43:45,550 --> 02:43:50,470
view on it and your angle and
it's, it's, it's refreshing to me.

2956
02:43:50,530 --> 02:43:52,630
And also I'm just, I mean
I'm even learning, right?

2957
02:43:52,631 --> 02:43:56,410
So I'm hearing a different angle and
like I talk about with, with everything,

2958
02:43:56,411 --> 02:43:57,700
it was like we just talked about with,

2959
02:43:57,910 --> 02:44:01,030
with flying at top gun or like it
isn't Jujitsu where like it isn't the

2960
02:44:01,031 --> 02:44:01,690
battlefield,

2961
02:44:01,690 --> 02:44:04,050
the more different angles you can see
something from the better you're going to

2962
02:44:04,060 --> 02:44:07,510
get at it. And so here I am listening to
you going, Oh, there's another angle. Yup,

2963
02:44:07,570 --> 02:44:11,920
here we go. So that was awesome.
And it was also the first time,

2964
02:44:12,520 --> 02:44:14,750
you know, with Jp, same
thing, you know, I,

2965
02:44:14,751 --> 02:44:17,920
I I listened to Jay but it's like the
first time JP who came with me and he was

2966
02:44:17,921 --> 02:44:19,990
just sitting in the back like
what you did the first time,

2967
02:44:19,991 --> 02:44:22,620
he would sit in the back and I say,
man, come, come up. You know when,

2968
02:44:22,621 --> 02:44:27,010
when I do this Q and a answer some
questions and you know, I'm thinking, Hey,

2969
02:44:27,011 --> 02:44:30,550
if something goes sideways I'll just
be able to cover for him. No big deal.

2970
02:44:30,880 --> 02:44:34,080
You know, somebody asks a question and
JP kind of gives me a look like, Hey,

2971
02:44:34,110 --> 02:44:36,460
well I'll answer this.
And I was like, okay,

2972
02:44:36,461 --> 02:44:40,660
you don't go ahead and I'll just cover
for you. She just gives an awesome answer.

2973
02:44:40,661 --> 02:44:43,420
I'm like, okay, I'll sit down now. And
it's the same thing with you. I was like,

2974
02:44:43,710 --> 02:44:46,180
you know, you're thinking, okay,
where's he going to go with this?

2975
02:44:46,181 --> 02:44:48,760
Where this is a tough question or
whatever and boom, here you go. You know,

2976
02:44:48,761 --> 02:44:50,520
fire for a fact. Um, and,

2977
02:44:50,710 --> 02:44:55,630
and both those two events happened
really close together for me and for me,

2978
02:44:55,631 --> 02:44:58,420
it was in,
I call actually called leaf,

2979
02:44:58,690 --> 02:45:03,370
I think it was the next day or is it
might've been that evening. And I said,

2980
02:45:03,480 --> 02:45:05,890
hey, you know, we're good to go.

2981
02:45:05,920 --> 02:45:10,920
Like we are not going to have to do all
of this ourselves because Dave and JP

2982
02:45:11,230 --> 02:45:16,060
can do this. They get it. They can,
they can do it in, which was, you know,

2983
02:45:16,061 --> 02:45:19,750
everybody in their own, I don't want
to think it's arrogance, but it's,

2984
02:45:19,900 --> 02:45:24,430
it's just you don't see it. And so
you kind of think, how is Indian,

2985
02:45:24,431 --> 02:45:26,050
you know what it's like when
you're in command to something.

2986
02:45:26,051 --> 02:45:27,850
That's one of the really hard
things to do is let go. You know,

2987
02:45:27,851 --> 02:45:29,500
and life's talked about this all the time.
You know,

2988
02:45:29,830 --> 02:45:33,610
when I'd be watching him rollout on
out the gate for his first mission,

2989
02:45:33,611 --> 02:45:35,680
I done all kinds of missions like that.

2990
02:45:35,681 --> 02:45:38,800
And here he's going out to this first
one that he's in charge of and you're

2991
02:45:38,801 --> 02:45:40,990
thinking, man, I should just go, I
want to go. I don't want to go in.

2992
02:45:41,170 --> 02:45:42,003
And then you know,

2993
02:45:42,010 --> 02:45:45,520
two hours it comes back and you're like
high five [inaudible] then you go, cool.

2994
02:45:45,550 --> 02:45:49,090
I don't have to be the guy that goes
every time. And so when, when I saw you,

2995
02:45:49,091 --> 02:45:52,510
when I saw JP and I was like, this
is awesome. I called life and said,

2996
02:45:52,720 --> 02:45:56,950
we are going to be good to go
on other guys. They can do this.

2997
02:45:56,951 --> 02:45:58,180
They can bring the same message,

2998
02:45:58,181 --> 02:46:01,900
they can bring the same passion and power
and knowledge. And that was very, very,

2999
02:46:02,350 --> 02:46:04,090
you know,
refreshing to me.

3000
02:46:04,360 --> 02:46:08,860
And bottom line is the experiences are
the same. I mean they're not exactly the,

3001
02:46:09,590 --> 02:46:10,400
but

3002
02:46:10,400 --> 02:46:12,410
the experience in Ramadi is the same.

3003
02:46:12,650 --> 02:46:16,580
And then the experience that we had
throughout our military career and now you

3004
02:46:16,581 --> 02:46:19,310
get to see what it's like interacting
with businesses and you see all those

3005
02:46:19,311 --> 02:46:22,010
similarities. So that was
uh, that was a big day.

3006
02:46:22,011 --> 02:46:24,560
And so in case I haven't
made this clear yet,

3007
02:46:24,590 --> 02:46:29,590
Dave now is with us part of the echelon
front team and doing what we do,

3008
02:46:30,950 --> 02:46:35,700
helping businesses with their
leadership in their companies.

3009
02:46:35,780 --> 02:46:40,540
So it's awesome. It's awesome having you
on. It's huge for me. I told you I left,

3010
02:46:40,550 --> 02:46:42,010
you know, I left the
Marine Corps. I'm like, ah,

3011
02:46:42,320 --> 02:46:43,700
there's something missing and I can't,

3012
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:45,740
I can't stay in marine cause
there's something missing.

3013
02:46:45,860 --> 02:46:50,330
Well you leave the Marine Corps like how
in the hell am I going to recreate that

3014
02:46:50,331 --> 02:46:53,060
thing that I'm looking for?
Not In the military.

3015
02:46:53,061 --> 02:46:56,450
It's all I know is that's the place.
And that was my biggest,

3016
02:46:56,810 --> 02:47:01,730
my biggest fear was I'm just going
to go like go to work, you know,

3017
02:47:01,810 --> 02:47:03,060
go do some thing that,

3018
02:47:03,770 --> 02:47:08,450
so I was worried like I
got to find something and
that's part of the reason why

3019
02:47:08,451 --> 02:47:11,990
that first Gig with you guys in the back.
I was like, holy cow manner. You've,

3020
02:47:12,260 --> 02:47:16,160
you've got to be kidding me.
It's all those things you just discussed.

3021
02:47:16,190 --> 02:47:16,791
All those things.

3022
02:47:16,791 --> 02:47:21,791
I spent my whole life living and
breathing and learning and then it's what

3023
02:47:22,071 --> 02:47:26,030
people like Lavan Jocko from where we're
going, we're going to do this together.

3024
02:47:26,060 --> 02:47:29,330
Yeah, so good deal, Dave.

3025
02:47:30,380 --> 02:47:31,940
Are you kidding me dude?

3026
02:47:33,150 --> 02:47:37,910
I wasn't on monster.com searching for
employment opportunities. Lave called me.

3027
02:47:37,911 --> 02:47:42,410
He said, come to Vienna. I'm
like, oh, okay. My head was
a million miles away, man.

3028
02:47:42,470 --> 02:47:45,740
I'm just working through paperwork to
drop my letter out to leave the marine

3029
02:47:45,741 --> 02:47:49,670
corps like very hastily with
no, no plan B. There was no,

3030
02:47:49,671 --> 02:47:51,860
I'm leaving to do this.
You can ask. He like,

3031
02:47:51,861 --> 02:47:56,360
there was zero conversation about what
I'm going to do and I came back from that.

3032
02:47:56,361 --> 02:47:59,570
I'm like a,
here's the plan.

3033
02:48:00,830 --> 02:48:05,780
And it duty was instantaneous for me.
It was instantaneous.

3034
02:48:05,810 --> 02:48:08,870
And then to be able to share that
message and believe it and have all those

3035
02:48:08,871 --> 02:48:13,040
feelings and in a, in a totally
different way and Dork with you guys.

3036
02:48:14,280 --> 02:48:18,380
Yeah. And it's cool too because you
get that kind of a, for you top gun.

3037
02:48:18,381 --> 02:48:21,200
For me working in the training
command where it's like,

3038
02:48:21,201 --> 02:48:24,920
oh look at what I already talked
about you, you have this experience.

3039
02:48:24,921 --> 02:48:27,290
And when I was getting out I was saying,
what am I going to do with this thing?

3040
02:48:27,291 --> 02:48:29,480
What am I going to do? But I got all
this knowledge and I thought, okay,

3041
02:48:29,481 --> 02:48:33,140
well I guess I'll put it in a cruise box
over here, lock it up and it'll, it'll,

3042
02:48:33,440 --> 02:48:36,200
it'll fade away and turn into dust.

3043
02:48:36,590 --> 02:48:39,590
But when you realize that you can
take what you learned and you can,

3044
02:48:39,800 --> 02:48:42,470
you can apply it to all these,
you know,

3045
02:48:42,471 --> 02:48:46,220
civilian civilians and civilian companies,
it's pretty,

3046
02:48:46,280 --> 02:48:49,510
it's a pretty damn good feeling
to have and to be out, go,

3047
02:48:49,580 --> 02:48:51,740
go out and do it on a regular basis.

3048
02:48:52,010 --> 02:48:55,250
And one of the best things about it
is you get to see the improvement.

3049
02:48:55,251 --> 02:48:58,310
You get to see teens.
And again,

3050
02:49:00,260 --> 02:49:03,080
it's kind of like when you show up and
you see the leadership issues you're

3051
02:49:03,081 --> 02:49:06,740
having, it's like you're seeing,
you know what the future is,

3052
02:49:06,770 --> 02:49:08,100
you know how to fix it and

3053
02:49:08,100 --> 02:49:09,600
you just go,
this is going to be fun.

3054
02:49:09,601 --> 02:49:13,050
And you get to see these people grow
and learn and improve and get better.

3055
02:49:13,051 --> 02:49:15,480
And if there are already good,
you get to see them become awesome.

3056
02:49:15,481 --> 02:49:16,440
If they're not doing great,

3057
02:49:16,441 --> 02:49:19,140
you get to see them improve their
position and then move in that direction.

3058
02:49:19,141 --> 02:49:23,100
So it's definitely rewarding from that
aspect. I know you've already seen that.

3059
02:49:23,310 --> 02:49:24,280
Yeah,
without a doubt.

3060
02:49:24,530 --> 02:49:27,420
You know that book and the lessons and
you talk to me about the title of the

3061
02:49:27,421 --> 02:49:30,510
book is how US Navy Seals lead and win.
You know,

3062
02:49:30,560 --> 02:49:34,440
I'm top my life is what I learned
from top gun in the Marine Corps.

3063
02:49:34,980 --> 02:49:38,850
It just so happens, like we
said, it's exactly the same.

3064
02:49:38,910 --> 02:49:42,750
I have my own long list of my personal
experiences with those things,

3065
02:49:43,440 --> 02:49:47,250
but I was telling you the day
like the concepts, it's identical.

3066
02:49:47,760 --> 02:49:50,140
And so there's no like big leap in my,
my God,

3067
02:49:50,160 --> 02:49:54,120
how am I going to get there from how my
name brace? This is, oh yeah. Oh my God.

3068
02:49:54,121 --> 02:49:57,060
That's exactly what I've been doing for
the last 23 years. Only my stories, this,

3069
02:49:57,061 --> 02:50:00,900
this and this and this is my view of
that. So, uh, again man, it was just,

3070
02:50:00,960 --> 02:50:05,880
it was so easy to just see it and
go, this is, this is legit. I am,

3071
02:50:06,470 --> 02:50:10,440
I'm all, I want to, I want
it right now. Hey, slow down.
Like, no, 100%. I don't want,

3072
02:50:10,500 --> 02:50:13,810
I don't want to go look for, well
this is still happening, right? Yeah,

3073
02:50:14,170 --> 02:50:17,250
it's happening. So try not to oversell
it, sell it a little bit, but it was,

3074
02:50:17,340 --> 02:50:22,110
I was all in five minutes in a day one.
It's been been awesome so far.

3075
02:50:22,111 --> 02:50:24,720

3084
02:50:59,870 --> 02:51:02,630
He's going to do a little
presentation cause you know what,

3085
02:51:02,710 --> 02:51:03,800
but he's going to do a presentation.

3086
02:51:03,801 --> 02:51:05,840
He's going to PR you can
do about the Ooda loop.

3087
02:51:08,820 --> 02:51:12,660
That's an a lot of questions about
the Ooda loop is to do it. President,

3088
02:51:12,661 --> 02:51:16,170
he's going to do a presentation about
the Ooda loop. It's going to be 14 hours.

3089
02:51:17,620 --> 02:51:20,640
Uh, no. He's going to talk, you
know, he's going to talk about his.

3090
02:51:21,440 --> 02:51:22,273
MMM.

3091
02:51:23,250 --> 02:51:25,590
His perspective on a lot of
this stuff and Ooda loop.

3092
02:51:25,770 --> 02:51:29,310
A lot of times people ask me about the
Hulu because I do talk about it and I've

3093
02:51:29,311 --> 02:51:31,350
said, I said a few, you know,
a month ago or something.

3094
02:51:31,351 --> 02:51:32,970
Somebody asked me about and I
said, you know what, I'm going to,

3095
02:51:33,030 --> 02:51:34,140
I'm going to bring you a professional,

3096
02:51:34,260 --> 02:51:39,210
a professional with that specific
information. So Dave, we'll be talking.

3097
02:51:39,240 --> 02:51:40,590
Obviously life is going to be there.

3098
02:51:41,130 --> 02:51:44,400
Jp is going to be there clearly as well.

3099
02:51:44,510 --> 02:51:48,690
Jp is going to be doing a
little presentation as well
from his perspective on

3100
02:51:48,691 --> 02:51:53,190
some things. Echo Charles, you know,
Echo Charles is going to be there.

3101
02:51:54,330 --> 02:51:56,220
Will he be doing a presentation?

3102
02:51:59,130 --> 02:52:02,610
I don't know. Time will tell. I
don't know what he would present on.

3103
02:52:02,940 --> 02:52:06,280
Maybe just present on
bring all the intensity.

3104
02:52:06,281 --> 02:52:11,050
Need to do a presentation on cruising.
Yeah, balance things out a little bit.

3105
02:52:11,060 --> 02:52:15,260
Back to throw a little, balance it at
that dichotomy right there and yeah,

3106
02:52:15,510 --> 02:52:19,570
so monster May 4th and fifth,
New York City Marriott,

3107
02:52:20,080 --> 02:52:23,050
Grand Marquis.
It's an event about leadership.

3108
02:52:23,380 --> 02:52:27,940
It's tools for Lucia leadership.
It's about understanding,

3109
02:52:28,960 --> 02:52:33,310
understanding leadership and getting those
reps in and hearing all the different

3110
02:52:33,311 --> 02:52:37,750
angles. That's what makes you good at
it. Of course it's live. Of course.

3111
02:52:37,751 --> 02:52:39,100
There's no backstage,

3112
02:52:39,250 --> 02:52:44,250
there's no diva green room
that will be hiding in saying,

3113
02:52:44,921 --> 02:52:48,190
bring me some green m and m's for my
next set. No, that's not happening.

3114
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:53,440
We won't be hiding is going to be all
of us together. We'll be learning,

3115
02:52:54,010 --> 02:52:57,910
becoming better leaders.
We will see you there.

3116
02:52:57,910 --> 02:53:02,050
Now as far as this podcast goes,
Echo Charles,

3117
02:53:02,620 --> 02:53:07,620
maybe you could present us at this time
with some information on if anybody does

3118
02:53:07,931 --> 02:53:11,350
want to support this podcast,
how they could do a small presentation,

3119
02:53:11,590 --> 02:53:14,110
small presentation. Who is
that with? The green m and M's.

3120
02:53:14,560 --> 02:53:16,750
That thing you said with the
agreement, that was somebody, right?

3121
02:53:16,760 --> 02:53:18,640
Still going to be rough.
It's David Lee Roth,

3122
02:53:18,700 --> 02:53:22,630
and I actually know the story behind this.
There's a reason why he did that.

3123
02:53:23,290 --> 02:53:26,680
They would have a, it's called
a, I forget what it's called,

3124
02:53:26,860 --> 02:53:30,430
but when you go to somewhere,
oh, it's called a rider, right?

3125
02:53:30,431 --> 02:53:32,770
So you get a contract and the
contract comes with a rider and says,

3126
02:53:32,771 --> 02:53:33,970
this is the things that we need.

3127
02:53:34,300 --> 02:53:38,950
So what David Lee Roth from van
Halen would do is he would say, Hey,

3128
02:53:39,550 --> 02:53:40,510
I want,
you know,

3129
02:53:40,570 --> 02:53:45,570
seven bowls of m and m's with no brown
m and m's in them or green or whatever.

3130
02:53:46,660 --> 02:53:49,690
I think it was brown, but
he'd say, no brown m and M's.

3131
02:53:50,650 --> 02:53:52,980
And this sounds like a ridiculous
request, right? I mean, who would,

3132
02:53:52,990 --> 02:53:55,450
who would possibly want
that? Blah, blah, blah. Well,

3133
02:53:55,630 --> 02:53:59,980
David Lee Roth did it for a reason. Why
do you think he did it? Can you guess? No.

3134
02:54:00,100 --> 02:54:03,610
Can you guess? Because check it
out. Think of how simple this is.

3135
02:54:03,611 --> 02:54:04,900
He's doing a concert one night.

3136
02:54:04,901 --> 02:54:07,840
He's doing a concert to light later
to concert three nights after that.

3137
02:54:07,841 --> 02:54:10,900
So he's on the road hitting these concert
venues and there's all this stuff that

3138
02:54:10,901 --> 02:54:14,830
has to be set up and all the stuff that
lights and sound and soundboards and

3139
02:54:14,831 --> 02:54:18,580
special effects and ramps and all this
stuff's gotta be set up and it's gotta be

3140
02:54:18,581 --> 02:54:19,414
set up right.

3141
02:54:20,230 --> 02:54:25,230
When he would show up if the seven bowls
of m and m's were laid out and there's

3142
02:54:25,631 --> 02:54:26,620
no brown m and m's in him,

3143
02:54:27,130 --> 02:54:30,250
he wouldn't have to go and inspect
everything cause he knew that they were

3144
02:54:30,251 --> 02:54:31,084
paying attention

3145
02:54:32,470 --> 02:54:35,770
and if he got there
and it wasn't that way,

3146
02:54:35,920 --> 02:54:38,530
he knew that these people had an
issue with attention to detail.

3147
02:54:38,560 --> 02:54:41,860
And so now he had to be a go and
scrutinize and make sure everything was in

3148
02:54:41,861 --> 02:54:45,710
place the way it was supposed to be.
Little lesson learned from David Lee Roth,

3149
02:54:45,930 --> 02:54:50,800
a little test test test m
and m's. Teth. Interesting.

3150
02:54:52,270 --> 02:54:57,190
And by the way, that story that I just
told, that may be a 100% urban myth,

3151
02:54:57,700 --> 02:55:02,200
but I know I heard it from somebody
I thought, I think it's true.

3152
02:55:02,680 --> 02:55:03,830
I'm sure somebody,
I'm sure

3153
02:55:04,010 --> 02:55:06,110
our listeners will tell us
where that can be referenced.

3154
02:55:06,800 --> 02:55:09,920
For some reason I thought it was somebody
else and that's just how they were,

3155
02:55:10,520 --> 02:55:15,320
or their OCD or something like that.
I don't know. But either way. Hey,

3156
02:55:15,321 --> 02:55:19,520
you're, so you think about like, um,

3157
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:25,000
the reason you were such an important
asset given your skill set as a forward

3158
02:55:26,181 --> 02:55:27,050
air controller,

3159
02:55:27,080 --> 02:55:31,040
that's what it's called is
because essentially you have
all this expertise while

3160
02:55:31,041 --> 02:55:35,990
you're in the air and you can bring
all that brain and eyes to the ground.

3161
02:55:36,290 --> 02:55:40,660
Yeah. That's why you're better than
your will. Yeah, I mean, absolutely.

3162
02:55:41,750 --> 02:55:44,420
I didn't really pick up on that until
kind of later. I was like, Dang,

3163
02:55:44,421 --> 02:55:48,050
that's pretty advanced.
If you think about any,

3164
02:55:48,620 --> 02:55:50,750
any aspect,
I mean it's like if you,

3165
02:55:50,970 --> 02:55:53,700
that's why in the corner of a
mixed martial arts match, oh,

3166
02:55:53,710 --> 02:55:56,780
oftentimes there'll be a striking coach,
right?

3167
02:55:56,781 --> 02:55:59,970
There'll be a Jujitsu coach and
they'll be a wrestling coach. You know,

3168
02:55:59,971 --> 02:56:02,570
that they'll have those specific guys
in there and sometimes they'll bring a

3169
02:56:02,571 --> 02:56:05,760
specific guy in to corner.
Like,

3170
02:56:05,810 --> 02:56:09,950
like Dean Dean has been brought in to
corner guys that are going against a

3171
02:56:09,951 --> 02:56:13,460
specific Jujitsu person because they want
to get a little bit of that expertise.

3172
02:56:13,700 --> 02:56:18,380
Same fundamental concept here. Okay. Hey,

3173
02:56:18,381 --> 02:56:22,760
when we started this podcast, I needed
somebody that knew how to press record.

3174
02:56:25,570 --> 02:56:26,720
Thethe same thing,

3175
02:56:26,750 --> 02:56:31,750
identical all those years of pressing
record and then stop and then record

3176
02:56:32,421 --> 02:56:35,870
again.
I'm kind of like good deal echo in a way.

3177
02:56:36,540 --> 02:56:40,490
Same thing and doing the same thing as
Dave really when it comes down to it.

3178
02:56:41,090 --> 02:56:43,990
Speaking of doing good things,

3179
02:56:46,930 --> 02:56:50,130
so that was a big like breath.

3180
02:56:50,131 --> 02:56:54,370
I'd you better say so back for right
now. Actually, I'm not gonna say a lot.

3181
02:56:56,090 --> 02:56:59,410
I felt like I really went deep
into the Krill oil analogy.

3182
02:56:59,800 --> 02:57:04,030
The nightclub Omega threes don't do
that. Yeah. You know the love of God.

3183
02:57:04,031 --> 02:57:08,260
I feel like the mess.
That was a good analogy.

3184
02:57:08,261 --> 02:57:11,260
That was a perfect analogy. She was
excellent. In fact, it was so good.

3185
02:57:11,261 --> 02:57:13,930
I wouldn't touch it. You get what I'm
saying? That's exactly what I'm saying.

3186
02:57:13,931 --> 02:57:16,330
You know that there's too
much of a good thing anyway.

3187
02:57:16,331 --> 02:57:19,750
If you didn't know what Krill oil is,
it's a little like what shrimp things,

3188
02:57:20,650 --> 02:57:24,670
baby shrimp. You extract the oil and
it's getting as good for your joints,

3189
02:57:24,680 --> 02:57:26,980
the Omega threes and that
they're good for returns. Anyway.

3190
02:57:27,850 --> 02:57:31,750
In regards to supplementation,
which I'm down for now. By the way,

3191
02:57:31,870 --> 02:57:34,900
I mean supplement person,
not all supplements,

3192
02:57:35,860 --> 02:57:40,690
just the key ones, joint, uh, maintenance,
whatnot. Anyway, get them from on it.

3193
02:57:40,691 --> 02:57:43,030
That's the best ones.
Everyone knows that factually.

3194
02:57:43,150 --> 02:57:46,930
So if you want a 10% discount on that,

3195
02:57:46,931 --> 02:57:48,250
good on it.com/delco

3196
02:57:50,700 --> 02:57:52,980
I want to talk about the
sodium in the water situation.

3197
02:57:54,420 --> 02:57:58,020
I got a feeling we're just going
to hear it over here. Yeah. So,

3198
02:57:59,520 --> 02:58:02,040
so while Dave and I are
talking the podcast,

3199
02:58:02,041 --> 02:58:06,300
are you just over here just dreaming
up just where you're going with this.

3200
02:58:06,570 --> 02:58:10,680
When you say Echo, how can you
support, I'm thinking, Dang,

3201
02:58:10,681 --> 02:58:14,760
you day's been controlling all this
stuff and going to the top going,

3202
02:58:14,761 --> 02:58:18,460
you've been doing your stuff
and I'm watching like sodium
in the lake videos you

3203
02:58:18,461 --> 02:58:22,320
ever, do you ever watch those? What
you have to do what I'm doing? Yeah. So

3204
02:58:26,710 --> 02:58:31,290
anyway, the more I watched those, the
better analogy I realize it is, you know,

3205
02:58:31,320 --> 02:58:32,820
with the Amazon Click through things.

3206
02:58:32,821 --> 02:58:36,930
So people want to support the spot gas
in easy way. Click through the website,

3207
02:58:36,931 --> 02:58:41,490
Jocko, podcast.com this little support
tab, click on it. Do Your Amazon shopping.

3208
02:58:42,420 --> 02:58:46,500
Some people are smart when they do this.
Clever,

3209
02:58:46,501 --> 02:58:49,380
they figured out which I met,
I think I mentioned or I,

3210
02:58:49,460 --> 02:58:53,040
I know I mentioned it long time ago,
but what they do is they click on it.

3211
02:58:53,040 --> 02:58:57,680
Then they save that URL
into their bookmarks. Some
people were smart like that.

3212
02:58:57,780 --> 02:59:01,020
Yeah. Like this says
Amazon, so on the right,

3213
02:59:01,050 --> 02:59:04,920
on my bookmarks bar just as Amazon
and that's what I did, right.

3214
02:59:05,610 --> 02:59:10,090
I did that. Yeah. Oh, hey man,
that's a smart thing to do. Porch.

3215
02:59:10,590 --> 02:59:13,230
Yeah. Good way to sport before
you do your Amazon shopping.

3219
02:59:26,490 --> 02:59:27,540
If you're in the videos,

3220
02:59:27,541 --> 02:59:32,541
you liked the video version of this
podcast or little excerpts that all put on

3221
02:59:34,291 --> 02:59:34,471
there.

3222
02:59:34,471 --> 02:59:37,560
If you don't want to watch necessarily
the whole podcast at any given moment,

3223
02:59:38,040 --> 02:59:42,780
little excerpt, you can take some
value from that. Also, sharable,

3224
02:59:42,990 --> 02:59:47,040
sharable. Yeah. Yeah. You don't
want to share with your buddy, hey,

3225
02:59:47,041 --> 02:59:50,360
I heard you've got this situation
going on. Just watch this two hour,

3226
02:59:50,400 --> 02:59:54,510
48 minute podcast. And I'm
like, no, people don't have
that kind of patience. No.

3227
02:59:54,520 --> 02:59:59,070
And for a lot of the time, the time
before they're going to work that day,

3228
02:59:59,160 --> 03:00:01,560
you know, they can listen to
four or five minutes, not there.

3229
03:00:01,561 --> 03:00:06,090
Like I got this guy that's really,
you know,

3230
03:00:06,210 --> 03:00:10,770
treat me bad at work. What should I
do? Cool. Is what you do. Ignore it.

3231
03:00:10,771 --> 03:00:15,010
Outperform next. Exactly. Yeah.

3232
03:00:15,600 --> 03:00:20,070
As opposed to hey, listen to this episode
number, whatever it is, two hours,

3233
03:00:20,250 --> 03:00:24,660
19 hours and do it. It's not
doable. It's not realistic.

3234
03:00:25,110 --> 03:00:29,640
Also, Jack was a store. It's called
chocolate store. Uh, we got a new design.

3235
03:00:29,670 --> 03:00:34,640
That's all I'm going to say about it. Um,
so yeah, going there. Jocko store.com. Um,

3236
03:00:34,680 --> 03:00:38,040
that's a, you know, a new new me, a new
shirt. New Tee shirt. Tee Shirt. Yeah.

3237
03:00:38,220 --> 03:00:42,870
A new tee shirt is out at this
time. It is currently, yeah. Dang.

3238
03:00:43,680 --> 03:00:47,210
This was kind of like a bullshit
of crowd get after it yet.

3239
03:00:50,010 --> 03:00:51,150
This is like a crowd.

3240
03:00:51,480 --> 03:00:55,050
I wouldn't consider it crowdsourced idea,

3241
03:00:55,110 --> 03:00:58,620
but you know how crowd demanded.
Yeah. You know, I was like,

3242
03:00:58,621 --> 03:01:01,240
hey that put this on the shirt.
Put this on a shirt and make sense.

3243
03:01:01,241 --> 03:01:01,811
Make sense though.

3244
03:01:01,811 --> 03:01:06,460
We're kind of extrapolated all the ideas
that I thought were good master move

3245
03:01:06,461 --> 03:01:11,050
over the ideas that I heard from you you
thought were good and boom there it is.

3246
03:01:11,110 --> 03:01:15,770
New Design up currently legit. Yup. Jocko.

3247
03:01:15,771 --> 03:01:20,550
store.com. Anyway, there's
some school stuff. Good for uh,

3248
03:01:21,040 --> 03:01:26,040
there's stuff for women and
rash guards there stuff.

3249
03:01:26,600 --> 03:01:29,410
Rash guards. No, I that was
the interruption of thought.

3250
03:01:29,760 --> 03:01:34,120
So like a rash guards. We have the new
registrar for brainy after this one. Yeah,

3251
03:01:34,130 --> 03:01:35,720
no, no, it's okay. Good.

3252
03:01:36,340 --> 03:01:39,640
You know how you think like five things
at once and they're all like jockeying

3253
03:01:39,641 --> 03:01:42,400
to see which ones are going to come
through and that's what happened there.

3254
03:01:43,410 --> 03:01:47,350
The rash guard a thought came in in one.
Anyway,

3255
03:01:47,440 --> 03:01:52,330
I think I'm going to put in new rash guard
one, um, design out as well. But anyway,

3256
03:01:52,331 --> 03:01:56,830
rash guards, if you want 19%
improvement in performance,

3257
03:01:57,760 --> 03:02:02,380
all aspects of performance,
all yeah, that's mental,
physical, emotional as well.

3258
03:02:03,550 --> 03:02:05,920
Double blind tested by the way.
Yeah.

3259
03:02:05,980 --> 03:02:10,900
I think like quadruple blind and
not blame testing all that stuff.

3260
03:02:10,960 --> 03:02:12,010
Psychological warfare.

3261
03:02:12,040 --> 03:02:17,040
If you're having weakness in maintaining
unmitigated daily discipline in all

3262
03:02:19,481 --> 03:02:24,400
things,
listen to psychological warfare.

3263
03:02:24,730 --> 03:02:25,240
Yeah.

3264
03:02:25,240 --> 03:02:29,530
I got, I just got interviewed the other
day and it was, uh, the guy, you know,

3265
03:02:29,531 --> 03:02:32,640
he sent me up to this question, you
know, hey, what do you do when you're,

3266
03:02:32,730 --> 03:02:36,130
you're in a situation where you've got,
you know,

3267
03:02:36,190 --> 03:02:38,080
you want to go to the gym or you're,

3268
03:02:38,081 --> 03:02:41,170
you're supposed to do some hard task for
work or you're trying to do something

3269
03:02:41,171 --> 03:02:43,790
to improve yourself and
you don't want that.

3270
03:02:43,960 --> 03:02:47,710
That mindset comes in where you just,
you just don't want to do it. You know?

3271
03:02:47,740 --> 03:02:49,600
What should you think
people should do then?

3272
03:02:49,860 --> 03:02:54,330
Yeah. And I said, do it anyway. Right.

3273
03:02:55,470 --> 03:02:56,030
And then it was all

3274
03:02:56,030 --> 03:02:59,030
quiet because he thinks I'm going
to give this big explanation,

3275
03:02:59,150 --> 03:03:03,530
but there is no big explanation.
The explanation is, oh,
this stuff is hard. Yeah.

3276
03:03:03,770 --> 03:03:05,600
I can't make that thing easier for you.

3277
03:03:05,810 --> 03:03:10,490
I cannot make 20 rep squats any
easier for you. I can't do it.

3278
03:03:10,880 --> 03:03:14,840
They're going to be hard. In fact,
they're going to suck and I can't make,

3279
03:03:14,841 --> 03:03:16,340
nothing I can do is going
to make it easier for you.

3280
03:03:16,370 --> 03:03:19,970
You know what you have to do to
do it anyways. It's kind of like

3281
03:03:21,670 --> 03:03:22,870
I told this to jade,

3282
03:03:22,890 --> 03:03:27,890
that exact situation where that thing
that you just said where it's even if you

3283
03:03:28,391 --> 03:03:31,480
don't feel like doing it, you still
want to do it and all this stuff. So,

3284
03:03:31,481 --> 03:03:34,600
but your body is like, oh, it's
kind of running on auto like okay,

3285
03:03:34,630 --> 03:03:36,190
compare it to like a video camera,
right?

3286
03:03:36,550 --> 03:03:39,250
Where you put the settings
on auto and it'll,

3287
03:03:39,610 --> 03:03:43,270
it'll adjust with how it's feeling and
that's how it's going to handle any

3288
03:03:43,271 --> 03:03:46,750
situation. The light kind of goes
down. It kind of adjust how it feels.

3289
03:03:46,751 --> 03:03:49,060
You know that to deal with this situation.

3290
03:03:49,330 --> 03:03:53,620
So if you're running on auto and you
don't feel like dealing head on with this

3291
03:03:53,621 --> 03:03:56,050
workout, these squats, you'd
going to maneuver around.

3292
03:03:56,051 --> 03:03:57,980
It just kind of automatically
know you've got to turn it

3293
03:03:57,980 --> 03:04:01,730
to manual. Manual can be like, I don't
care if they're heart squats, easy squats.

3294
03:04:01,840 --> 03:04:04,820
What I want to do and this is
what we're doing. Yes, exactly.

3295
03:04:04,821 --> 03:04:08,230
So it's like a manual mind control.
Just control your own mind. Yeah,

3296
03:04:08,260 --> 03:04:09,093
he's talking about that.

3297
03:04:09,170 --> 03:04:12,470
Don't do it on like the automatic
because your body wants to rest. Really.

3298
03:04:12,471 --> 03:04:17,120
It wants to rest week. Your buddy wants
to rest every single day. Actually.

3299
03:04:17,150 --> 03:04:21,770
You got to turn it from model to man
and you can get information like this in

3300
03:04:21,771 --> 03:04:26,450
psychological warfare,
iTunes, the artist's name,

3301
03:04:27,230 --> 03:04:31,190
Jocko, Jocko Willink, the artist.
I never thought that I would be,

3302
03:04:31,191 --> 03:04:35,660
I thought you had to paint something or
sculpt something to be an artist. Yeah,

3303
03:04:35,720 --> 03:04:38,930
I fought that.
I think now I put something on iTunes.

3304
03:04:38,960 --> 03:04:42,990
Then they just have no urine artists now
that

3305
03:04:44,740 --> 03:04:47,950
they're really stretching the words on
that. But yeah, man, if you're, you know,

3306
03:04:47,960 --> 03:04:50,570
if you're slipping on the Diet,

3307
03:04:50,960 --> 03:04:53,390
waking up in the morning
and you want to hit snooze,

3308
03:04:53,960 --> 03:04:57,620
maybe Postville at my workout
and you want,

3309
03:04:58,280 --> 03:05:03,050
how should I say, like a spot to switch
the dial from automatic to manual.

3310
03:05:03,830 --> 03:05:07,740
That's what it is. So search psychological
warfare on iTunes, Jocko Willink,

3311
03:05:08,710 --> 03:05:11,750
get after it. It's a war on
weakness. Yeah, big time.

3312
03:05:12,530 --> 03:05:14,780
You know when you're clicking
through Amazon, by the way,

3313
03:05:14,781 --> 03:05:19,781
you can get and Jocko white tea
there on Amazon and you know

3314
03:05:22,460 --> 03:05:26,390
when you get it, I'm just gonna
say this, when you get it,

3315
03:05:27,080 --> 03:05:28,070
you will see,

3316
03:05:29,240 --> 03:05:33,710
and I'm going to give you one word just
to kind of what to what to anticipate.

3317
03:05:35,260 --> 03:05:38,410
Just just think about this dead lift.
That's what you're going to be.

3318
03:05:38,420 --> 03:05:41,060
That's what's going to come to come
to mind with the Jocko white tea.

3319
03:05:41,180 --> 03:05:44,270
It's going to be going up a lot.
So, and that's, by the way, again,

3320
03:05:44,630 --> 03:05:49,070
quadruple blind double testing
that you're going to bring your,

3321
03:05:49,350 --> 03:05:51,050
you know, minimum. What's the lightest?

3322
03:05:51,051 --> 03:05:55,730
I think the minimum that you're going
to get dead lifting is eight thousand

3323
03:05:55,730 --> 03:05:57,140
eight thousand pounds upon,
so get on that.

3324
03:05:57,560 --> 03:06:02,060
You can also preorder way the warrior
kid, it comes out May 2nd. By the way,

3325
03:06:02,061 --> 03:06:07,061
it just came out on iTunes as one of the
most anticipated books of the spring.

3326
03:06:10,070 --> 03:06:12,230
Oh Dang it got listed right.

3327
03:06:12,830 --> 03:06:15,590
How do you imagine that right kid's book.

3328
03:06:15,740 --> 03:06:19,340
Now all of a sudden we're talking
most anticipated book of the spring,

3329
03:06:19,341 --> 03:06:22,370
which means people are waiting for it and
they've ordered it. So if you want it,

3330
03:06:23,210 --> 03:06:23,870
order it now.

3331
03:06:23,870 --> 03:06:28,580
Now I'm going to tell you there's some
people that are not looking forward to

3332
03:06:28,581 --> 03:06:31,850
this book coming out. They
are not anticipating. You
know who those people are?

3333
03:06:31,910 --> 03:06:35,120
Beliefs. Oh yeah. Bullies
aren't looking forward to it.

3334
03:06:35,210 --> 03:06:39,560
I'll tell you who else isn't. Looking
forward to this, coming out. Donut makers,

3335
03:06:40,340 --> 03:06:44,240
people that make donuts, you
know the Gig is up. Weakness.

3336
03:06:44,800 --> 03:06:48,850
You know weaknesses like a creature,
like a unique creature. Yeah.

3337
03:06:50,090 --> 03:06:51,380
He's not looking forward to this book.

3338
03:06:51,380 --> 03:06:53,060
Come out because all of
those things are going down.

3339
03:06:53,180 --> 03:06:54,410
All those things are trembling.

3340
03:06:54,870 --> 03:06:58,740
Make those things tremble harder.

3341
03:06:58,950 --> 03:07:03,930
Order way. The warrior kid for
your kid, for your neighbor's kid,

3342
03:07:04,230 --> 03:07:06,930
and for yourself,
you will dig it.

3343
03:07:08,700 --> 03:07:11,760
Also, discipline equals
freedom. The field manual,

3344
03:07:12,090 --> 03:07:16,260
it's coming out in October 17th I
know it seems like a long time away,

3345
03:07:16,261 --> 03:07:21,030
but I'm telling you, you should preorder
it now. Why? Because when you preorder it,

3346
03:07:21,060 --> 03:07:23,640
you will then know that it is coming

3347
03:07:26,190 --> 03:07:28,350
and when you know it is coming,

3348
03:07:28,500 --> 03:07:33,500
you will begin to prepare for it mentally
and physically for this book to arrive

3349
03:07:33,751 --> 03:07:34,501
on your doorstep.

3350
03:07:34,501 --> 03:07:39,501
You want to be ready mentally and
physically because when you get this book,

3351
03:07:40,350 --> 03:07:42,630
you will have to do certain things,

3352
03:07:42,750 --> 03:07:46,350
namely get after it. Yeah, that one.

3353
03:07:47,340 --> 03:07:50,430
Extreme ownership. Of course the
book, you can get it right now.

3354
03:07:50,431 --> 03:07:55,410
You don't have to wait at all, not just
for you, but for your team, your spouse,

3355
03:07:55,470 --> 03:07:59,550
your boss, your babysitter,
your mother in law.

3356
03:07:59,790 --> 03:08:03,930
You know she needs a copy of that.
She needs it. It takes ownership.

3357
03:08:03,931 --> 03:08:07,830
So grabbing a copy, just be gentle with
it. You don't have to throw it at her,

3358
03:08:07,831 --> 03:08:10,170
but maybe just place it on her desk.

3359
03:08:10,980 --> 03:08:15,980
So she can read it because the more people
you get in the game and start taking

3360
03:08:16,831 --> 03:08:21,060
ownership of things, the better your
life's going to be straight up. Now,

3361
03:08:22,380 --> 03:08:25,800
if that isn't enough of us,

3362
03:08:26,700 --> 03:08:28,260
you can find us

3363
03:08:29,850 --> 03:08:33,960
active on the interwebs,
Twitter,

3364
03:08:34,710 --> 03:08:36,000
Instagram and if you on it,

3365
03:08:36,030 --> 03:08:39,090
look at that Facebook [inaudible]
we gonna be there as well.

3366
03:08:39,240 --> 03:08:42,540
Dave is at David Burke.

3367
03:08:43,020 --> 03:08:48,020
Echo is at echocharles
and I am at Jocko Willink.

3368
03:08:49,770 --> 03:08:53,760
Echo. Charles, any closing words? Uh,

3369
03:08:53,761 --> 03:08:56,850
I feel like we should talk about the
movie top gun a little bit, right?

3370
03:08:57,030 --> 03:09:01,290
No one question on quit. And you know
how like when you watch top gun right in,

3371
03:09:01,291 --> 03:09:04,200
of course maverick, that's your
guy or goose. That's your guy.

3372
03:09:05,070 --> 03:09:07,960
Did you like iceman
cause he was pretty dope.

3373
03:09:10,050 --> 03:09:14,250
I'm talking about right. Absolutely.
Who doesn't like guys man, boom. See?

3374
03:09:14,610 --> 03:09:19,530
Absolutely. There it is. Yup. Simple
as that. That's your one question.

3375
03:09:19,531 --> 03:09:23,040
Real fun question yet or did you ever
buzz the tower? You know what I'm saying?

3376
03:09:23,130 --> 03:09:25,260
That never happened is that fake.

3377
03:09:25,860 --> 03:09:27,660
You can't really do that
and I can't really do that.

3378
03:09:28,170 --> 03:09:30,780
You can be in a ton of trouble as
they say. You can do anything once.

3379
03:09:31,320 --> 03:09:33,840
You can do that once and then
what you're out. You're out.

3380
03:09:34,730 --> 03:09:39,210
But not if you're maverick.
Awesome.

3381
03:09:39,840 --> 03:09:43,380
Dave men, obviously. Thanks Tom
for coming on. And you got me.

3382
03:09:43,570 --> 03:09:46,130
You got any closing remarks and
I'm sure we'll do this again.

3383
03:09:46,131 --> 03:09:47,040
And when you listen to this,

3384
03:09:47,041 --> 03:09:49,650
you'll think of a bunch of stuff
that we should have said on this one,

3385
03:09:49,651 --> 03:09:54,190
but anything else you want to wrap it up
with for today? Yeah, man. First thanks.

3386
03:09:54,190 --> 03:09:56,980
This was awesome. Uh, I've been thinking
about this for a couple of weeks now.

3387
03:09:56,981 --> 03:09:59,800
We've been talking about it and I was
super fired up to be here and this was,

3388
03:10:00,130 --> 03:10:03,070
this was awesome. Um, you know,

3389
03:10:03,071 --> 03:10:06,520
we were talking about it just briefly and
I mentioned it, you know, my, my wife,

3390
03:10:06,521 --> 03:10:09,610
obviously I talked about the
things that they went through.

3391
03:10:11,900 --> 03:10:14,260
So my wife and my mom,
he lives, or my family.

3392
03:10:14,280 --> 03:10:17,360
Those are folks that have
endured to whatever degree
that when you were removed,

3393
03:10:17,361 --> 03:10:19,400
I think when you're on deployment
and you do this stuff, it's hard,

3394
03:10:19,401 --> 03:10:22,910
but it's actually in some ways harder
for the people that you leave behind

3395
03:10:22,911 --> 03:10:25,770
because they don't know what's going on.
They're just waiting and wondering and,

3396
03:10:25,790 --> 03:10:27,980
and dealing with it and they're
kind of holding their breath.

3397
03:10:28,670 --> 03:10:32,330
I remember a story that Whitney
told me when I was deployed,

3398
03:10:32,690 --> 03:10:33,830
I didn't think about any of this stuff.

3399
03:10:33,890 --> 03:10:37,250
I'm a buddy in Neil's that come
to the house. He was gone and, uh,

3400
03:10:38,120 --> 03:10:40,910
he couldn't get in the house and he,
he was knocking on the window,

3401
03:10:40,911 --> 03:10:44,810
which was by the front of the House
and kind of ringing the doorbell.

3402
03:10:44,900 --> 03:10:46,250
And it was late at night,

3403
03:10:46,280 --> 03:10:49,760
like not a time that somebody should
be at the door and she didn't want to

3404
03:10:49,761 --> 03:10:51,890
answer the door.
And she's telling me this stuff.

3405
03:10:51,980 --> 03:10:54,140
You don't think about that stuff
until you get back in here.

3406
03:10:54,141 --> 03:10:57,440
The stories cause you don't really think
about what your family's going through

3407
03:10:57,470 --> 03:10:58,790
because you're busy and
you're doing your thing,

3408
03:10:59,720 --> 03:11:03,230
and she talked about the thing that she
hated the most was people knocking on

3409
03:11:03,231 --> 03:11:07,070
the door because she was always just
sort of a tiny bit paranoid that it was

3410
03:11:07,100 --> 03:11:10,310
going to be somebody coming
to tell her about me.

3411
03:11:12,420 --> 03:11:14,690
You know Chris, Chris's mom, Kathy Leon,

3412
03:11:14,700 --> 03:11:18,770
who's someone I don't even have the
words to describe how much I love her and

3413
03:11:18,771 --> 03:11:21,950
admire her and it's not
just about her loss.

3414
03:11:21,951 --> 03:11:25,070
She obviously she had to answer
that call. Well, you know,

3415
03:11:25,071 --> 03:11:29,900
she had to take that call on June 20th,
2006 she took that phone call,

3416
03:11:29,901 --> 03:11:34,901
but that woman has endured the loss of a
marine who sacrificed herself on behalf

3417
03:11:35,871 --> 03:11:38,240
of the entire country and my relationship,

3418
03:11:38,250 --> 03:11:40,370
the irony of all this is that I would not,

3419
03:11:41,120 --> 03:11:43,280
I would not have a
relationship with Kathy.

3420
03:11:43,640 --> 03:11:48,200
It Chris wasn't killed and I would give
anything to take that day back and bring

3421
03:11:48,380 --> 03:11:53,360
him home. I would trade any of it, but
the goodness that comes out of that,

3422
03:11:53,361 --> 03:11:54,340
there's always,

3423
03:11:54,740 --> 03:11:59,420
there was always some goodness if you
look forward hard enough that comes out of

3424
03:11:59,421 --> 03:12:02,780
all this stuff on and the loss
and the things that you sacrifice.

3425
03:12:02,870 --> 03:12:07,850
And I know Cathy has certainly
is listening in and I
never anticipated having a

3426
03:12:07,851 --> 03:12:11,600
relationship with, with someone like
that based on those circumstances.

3427
03:12:11,601 --> 03:12:14,770
But my relationship with
her is really important. Uh,

3428
03:12:14,771 --> 03:12:17,540
and what she has done for the
country is really important.

3429
03:12:17,541 --> 03:12:20,150
And if you look hard enough
in the worst situations,

3430
03:12:20,151 --> 03:12:21,500
you find something that's good.

3431
03:12:22,220 --> 03:12:24,380
And my relationship with her is
really good and I would really,

3432
03:12:24,560 --> 03:12:27,770
it would be wrong for me to go through
this whole Todd cast and talking to all

3433
03:12:27,771 --> 03:12:32,150
those things to without
acknowledging that goodness with her.

3434
03:12:32,151 --> 03:12:33,440
So I wanted to mention that.

3435
03:12:36,220 --> 03:12:37,600
Well Dave,

3436
03:12:38,800 --> 03:12:42,430
obviously thanks for,
thanks for coming on.

3437
03:12:42,431 --> 03:12:46,360
I know we've been talking about this for
a while and it's great to have you on

3438
03:12:46,430 --> 03:12:46,611
it.

3439
03:12:46,611 --> 03:12:51,611
Thanks for sharing your story with

3440
03:12:52,010 --> 03:12:56,760
us. The story of you, but marine

3441
03:12:58,860 --> 03:13:01,620
fighter pilot a forward air controller

3442
03:13:03,240 --> 03:13:06,210
but also a son.
A brother,

3443
03:13:08,260 --> 03:13:12,100
my father,
a person,

3444
03:13:14,410 --> 03:13:19,360
and yeah,
thanks for sharing the story

3445
03:13:21,170 --> 03:13:25,250
of Corporal Chris Leon.
A marine,

3446
03:13:25,670 --> 03:13:26,503
no doubt

3447
03:13:30,950 --> 03:13:33,550
a hero without question,

3448
03:13:36,810 --> 03:13:41,260
but
let us remember.

3449
03:13:41,261 --> 03:13:44,560
Let us always remember that these men,

3450
03:13:47,750 --> 03:13:52,070
these men we call warriors,
these men,

3451
03:13:52,071 --> 03:13:55,040
we call soldiers.
These men we call marines.

3452
03:13:55,670 --> 03:13:58,070
These men we call heroes,

3453
03:14:01,620 --> 03:14:06,520
but us never forget
that they're people,

3454
03:14:10,220 --> 03:14:11,750
sons and daughters,

3455
03:14:12,200 --> 03:14:15,980
husbands and wives and
brothers and sisters.

3456
03:14:16,280 --> 03:14:17,113
Okay,

3457
03:14:19,650 --> 03:14:22,220
let us not forget that they're there.

3458
03:14:22,230 --> 03:14:27,230
Not only courageous and vigilant and
bold and aggressive and inspiring,

3459
03:14:32,960 --> 03:14:34,520
but they're also funny

3460
03:14:36,130 --> 03:14:39,970
and outrageous and flawed like any of us,

3461
03:14:43,480 --> 03:14:44,560
and that they're loving

3462
03:14:48,400 --> 03:14:49,233
Ben loved,

3463
03:14:53,310 --> 03:14:54,190
and that there are people,

3464
03:14:56,510 --> 03:14:59,270
people who left behind people.

3465
03:15:03,380 --> 03:15:08,110
Then those that are left behind.
Never Forget.

3466
03:15:11,240 --> 03:15:14,810
Bye. Chris Leones mom, Kathy Leon

3467
03:15:16,820 --> 03:15:19,130
who wrote,
but no

3468
03:15:20,960 --> 03:15:24,530
on his memorial page back in 2008

3469
03:15:28,240 --> 03:15:30,370
and she said,
hi baby.

3470
03:15:32,450 --> 03:15:35,270
Another difficult day to
face without you here.

3471
03:15:38,590 --> 03:15:43,590
I never thought that Memorial
Day would be in memory of you.

3472
03:15:45,910 --> 03:15:48,700
My dear, sweet, beautiful sun.

3473
03:15:52,730 --> 03:15:57,560
It's been one year,
11 months and five days,

3474
03:15:59,910 --> 03:16:04,800
so close to two years.
Then I cannot bear the thought.

3475
03:16:09,570 --> 03:16:14,570
We honor you by flying the flag every
day and we will place you are American

3476
03:16:16,231 --> 03:16:19,740
heroes tribute banner
for all to see tomorrow.

3477
03:16:24,370 --> 03:16:27,130
Of course,
we will cry more tears

3478
03:16:28,930 --> 03:16:33,310
and maybe find a smile
or laugh as we remember.

3479
03:16:33,370 --> 03:16:36,700
Your deep voice,
great smile,

3480
03:16:38,130 --> 03:16:42,120
joking, sense of humor and
the love you show to us.

3481
03:16:48,500 --> 03:16:53,210
Our hearts are forever
empty and broken without you

3482
03:16:57,690 --> 03:17:01,080
miss you so much and love you more.

3483
03:17:03,820 --> 03:17:08,170
All our love
mom and dad,

3484
03:17:22,090 --> 03:17:22,923
remember?

3485
03:17:23,600 --> 03:17:24,433
Yeah,

3486
03:17:26,670 --> 03:17:29,850
remember Major Henry l Rod.

3487
03:17:33,150 --> 03:17:36,030
Remember Corporal Christopher Leon.

3488
03:17:39,970 --> 03:17:42,970
Remember those like them who have fallen.

3489
03:17:47,240 --> 03:17:52,130
Remember them as warriors.
Remember them as heroes,

3490
03:17:57,340 --> 03:17:58,240
but always,

3491
03:18:01,250 --> 03:18:03,380
always remembered them

3492
03:18:06,740 --> 03:18:07,573
as people

3493
03:18:14,270 --> 03:18:15,103
remember them.

3494
03:18:22,470 --> 03:18:23,460
Until next time,

3495
03:18:24,930 --> 03:18:28,320

3496
