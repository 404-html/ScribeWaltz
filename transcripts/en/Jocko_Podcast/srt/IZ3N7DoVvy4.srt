00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,960
This is Jocko podcast number
23 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,170
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo, good evening.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,393
Better

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,880
and faster and stronger
and smarter and wiser.

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,710
Always trying to get a little
bit of all those things

6
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,260
and we try and get wiser. That's
one of those things. That's wisdom,

7
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:41,780
which technically wisdom
comes from experience.

8
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,280
So how do you Garner experience you?

9
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,010
You can't just make yourself live
longer in a shorter period of time. No,

10
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:52,940
it doesn't work that way.

11
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,280
So what do we do to garner wisdom?

12
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,530
We look to the past.
You got to know your past,

13
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:05,970
you've got to know history.

14
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:14,070
And as I tell my son on
a pretty regular basis,

15
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,930
history revolves around war.

16
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,020
And in many ways history is war

17
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,160
and war.

18
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:28,853
Yeah,

19
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,360
is a human endeavor.

20
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,000
The worst of human endeavors.
Some.

21
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,640
But it is a human endeavor nonetheless.

22
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,330
And because it is a human endeavor,

23
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,900
it therefore reflects human nature.

24
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,880
And that's why we can learn so
much from the history of war,

25
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,130
not just about war itself,

26
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,330
but about man and about human nature.

27
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:05,200
And the same goes for principles of war.

28
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,140
The principles of war can be applied
to life, can be applied to business,

29
00:02:11,141 --> 00:02:15,970
can be applied to relationships,
can be applied to every human endeavor.

30
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,700
And so with that in mind,

31
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,480
that full spectrum of application,

32
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,810
let's take a look at the oldest
book about the principles of war

33
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,290
written in 500 BC over 2,500 years ago.

34
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,340
A book whose principles still apply today,

35
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,500
some sues the art of War Sun Sue said

36
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,270
the art of war is a
importance to the state.

37
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,850
It is a matter of life and death.

38
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,210
A road either to safety or to ruin.

39
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:13,590
Hence it is a subject of inquiry
which can or no account be neglected.

40
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,100
You gotta study war

41
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,281
and like I said,

42
00:03:22,281 --> 00:03:27,281
it is really about life in conflict
and friction in relationships and human

43
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:33,950
interaction. You're going to see all
of that when you start looking at the,

44
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,420
at the art of war

45
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,430
and he restarts talking about trying
to figure out who's going to win in a

46
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:43,264
situation

47
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,940
when seeking to determine the
military conditions. Let them be made.

48
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,420
The basis of,
of a comparison in this wise,

49
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,320
which of the two generals has most
ability on which side is discipline most

50
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,850
rigorously enforced?
Which army is stronger?

51
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,890
On which side?

52
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:13,950
Our officers and men most highly
trained in which army is there.

53
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,760
The greater constancy in
both reward and punishment.

54
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,690
Okay.

55
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,730
That's something you talked about Echo
Charles, and we're talking about kids.

56
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,530
You talked about how it's important
for the punishment to be constant and

57
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:37,100
consistent.
Yes.

58
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,450
Now what's interesting here, and this
is something we've talked about before,

59
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,920
and you know what?
I'm gonna say that a lot today.

60
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,640
This is something we've
talked about before because
when you start talking about

61
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:48,700
military strategy,
it runs through the ages.

62
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:53,140
There's threads that run through the
ages, and this is one of them. He says,

63
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,690
while heating the profit of my council,

64
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,650
avail yourself also have any helpful
circumstances over and beyond the ordinary

65
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:05,044
rules.

66
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:06,690
Okay?

67
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:10,200
According as circumstances are favorable,
one,

68
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:12,720
you should modify ones plans,

69
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,520
so don't get dead set on something.
Don't get locked into a plan.

70
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,670
You gotta be open to change it.

71
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,593
Yeah.

72
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,100
Continuing all warfare
is based on deception.

73
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,190
Hence,
when able to attack,

74
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,360
we must seem unable when using our forces.

75
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,780
We must seem inactive.
When we are near.

76
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,800
We must make the enemy believe
we are away when far away.

77
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,920
We must make him believe we are near
hold out baits to entice the enemy fame

78
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,340
disorder and crush him.

79
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,860
Now this is something that applies it
absolutely directly to Jujitsu. Obviously,

80
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,840
you know, uh Oh. Oh you, you think
you're going to get my arm? Boom.

81
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:07,220
I just, I just swept
you and got on top. Oh,

82
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:09,920
I'm really panicking. This situation.
Oh, guess what? I just got deep.

83
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:13,050
Half guard came out in the back and
now I'm going to choke you. Hmm.

84
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:16,863
Okay.

85
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,500
Back to the book. If he
is secured, all points,

86
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:24,420
be prepared for him if he is
superior and strength, evade him.

87
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,110
If your opponent is of Kolarik temper,
seek to irritate him.

88
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,400
Pretend to be weak,
that he may grow arrogant

89
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,580
so well. This is something people
don't think about. The fact that hey,

90
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:45,581
if your opponent has superior strength
of atum and obviously that's something

91
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,640
that we also heard from Mau,
the same,

92
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:52,970
that was the same gorilla strategy. If
your opponent strong, you avoid him,

93
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,000
and here he's saying if they've, if
they're losing their temper a little bit,

94
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,000
go ahead and irritate
them. Help that along. You

95
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:05,360
pretend to be weak so that your
opponent grows arrogant and thinks,

96
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,470
doesn't have to worry about you.

97
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,563
Hmm.

98
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,330
Continuing.
If he is taking his ease,

99
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,040
give him no rest. If his forces
are United, separate them.

100
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,180
Attack him where he's unprepared.
Appear where you are not expected.

101
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:27,470
These military devices leading to
victory must not be divulged beforehand.

102
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,740
It's,
it's,

103
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,880
it's strange that this is the oldest
book and this thread runs throughout

104
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:38,120
history and yet people
interacting with each other.

105
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,450
We'll constantly decide that
there's going to go toe to toe.

106
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,240
You're going to argue with me. Cool. I'm
just going to go toe to toe with you.

107
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

108
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:51,170
This is an intellectual approach
and I think that's, but you know,

109
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,460
if you're not detached,

110
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,560
it's harder to jump on that
intellectual methodology. Yes.

111
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,281
With you.

112
00:07:58,281 --> 00:08:03,281
If you come at me with your argument
head on or you accuse me or you're trying

113
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,170
to tighten me up on something,
you're just being super direct with me.

114
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,213
It's your diet.

115
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,950
I might get offended and then what I'm
going to do when I go right back at you,

116
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,990
right? Instead of maneuvering
on you, right? So like, yeah,

117
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,830
if someone's super,
super smart or super calculated,

118
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,920
they're way more likely to
to sign on to this type of,

119
00:08:21,921 --> 00:08:24,260
so as you started losing
your temper with someone,

120
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,900
think about what Echo Charles just said.

121
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,720
That means you're not being very smart
and you're not being very calculated

122
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:33,320
means you're making a mistake. You know
means there's a better route to go,

123
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,303
you know?

124
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,443
Okay,

125
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,430
now continuing.

126
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:43,490
Now the general who wins a battle makes
many calculations in his temple air.

127
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:45,660
The battle is fought.

128
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,670
The general who loses a battle makes
but few calculations beforehand.

129
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,030
So you got to plan and it's free.

130
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,060
It's interesting you the word calculate
calculative and he just used the same

131
00:08:59,101 --> 00:08:59,934
word,

132
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,543
okay?

133
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,550
Now,
this is something that I've talked about

134
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,670
to fight and conquer and all your
battles is not supreme excellence.

135
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:11,520
Okay?

136
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,450
I'll say that again.

137
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,570
To fight and conquer in all your
battles is not supreme excellence.

138
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:23,630
Supreme Excellence consists in breaking
the enemy's resistance without fighting,

139
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,230
and I always take that one step further.

140
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,410
I always take the point that the enemy
doesn't even know that there was a fight,

141
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,210
right? Right. They didn't
even know what was happening.

142
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,360
They thought they were having dinner and
going to sleep, but they just got beat,

143
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,730
and that's especially true when you're in,

144
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,230
you're part of a team and
you're trying to win some.

145
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:45,300
Are you trying to push your idea through?
You're trying to,

146
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,180
trying to convince people of something.

147
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,570
The best way to convince them is when
you didn't go toe to toe with them.

148
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,900
They came to the conclusion themselves.
At least they think they did, right?

149
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:00,210
You fought them without fighting them.
Thus,

150
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:04,620
the highest form of general ship
is to block the enemy's plans.

151
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,400
The next best is to prevent
the junction of enemy forces.

152
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,540
The next in order is to
attack the enemy's army.

153
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,750
In the field and the worst policy
of all is to besieged walled cities.

154
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,450
The rule is not to besiege wall
cities if it can possibly be avoided.

155
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,163
Yeah.

156
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,800
Now,
this is another thing,

157
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,180
and I've said this on this podcast before,

158
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,810
which is if someone is super dug in on a
position or why are you going to attack

159
00:10:38,811 --> 00:10:39,644
them?

160
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,960
If you have this belief that you're just
dug in on and I'm trying to maneuver

161
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,120
around it, why am I going to
attack that position? You've got,

162
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,580
you know more about it.
You've studied it.

163
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,820
You've been in this argument 47
times in the last three weeks,

164
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,170
so how am I going to come up against
you when you've got that well fortified

165
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,900
position? Yeah. The answer is I'm not.
It's not going to work out good for me.

166
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,253
Yeah.

167
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,320
Therefore, the skillful leader subdues
the enemy's troops without any fighting.

168
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,550
He captures their cities
without laying any siege.

169
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:18,010
He overthrows their kingdom without
lengthy operations in the field.

170
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,070
That's the goal. That
is the goal. You had.

171
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:24,640
Just something else about martial arts.

172
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,880
I think like when you get someone
that really knows how to fight,

173
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:33,040
most of the time you don't have to fight.
Yup. Most of the time you can tell,

174
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,270
people can tell that you know
how to fight. Like for instance,

175
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:40,990
when they get in your face and you smile
at them and you go, oh, let's do this.

176
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,240
Then they realize this is not a good idea.
Yeah.

177
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,330
Little projection of power

178
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,900
going on here.

179
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,350
Thus we may that there are five
essential oils for victory.

180
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,410
He will win. Who knows when to
fight and when not to fight.

181
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:09,660
This is sort of like when we were doing
Napoleon and and just about everything

182
00:12:09,661 --> 00:12:13,080
in the book, you can just
stop and think about and it's,

183
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,840
and it's also sorta like Jujitsu
in that what you've learned,

184
00:12:15,841 --> 00:12:18,510
it's once you hear it,
it seems super obvious,

185
00:12:18,511 --> 00:12:20,570
but why aren't you thinking
about all the time? Right.

186
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:24,030
And why do you make stupid
mistakes that portray that rule?

187
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,860
Yeah. Cause it's not front
of your mind, right? Yeah.

188
00:12:28,861 --> 00:12:30,270
It's like I said,
the two.

189
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:35,940
When you're emotionally charged,
it's you just handle things way different,

190
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:41,640
which it's kind of ironic in a way because
that's what makes this so effective

191
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,540
when people normally handle
themselves in that emotional way. Yes,

192
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,850
and that's what Vander
yourself in this way.

193
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,710
That's the very thing
that makes it effective.

194
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,190
Yeah.
The underlying theme to this,

195
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,830
the which hasn't been said,

196
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,170
I mean he doesn't address
this the way I addressed it,

197
00:12:57,171 --> 00:12:59,030
the way I talk about it in our book,

198
00:12:59,031 --> 00:13:00,470
the way we talked about
on the podcast is the,

199
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,420
the idea that you're talking about,

200
00:13:02,421 --> 00:13:05,960
which is the idea of detaching and not
beat emotional so that you can do things

201
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,480
so that you can make good decisions.
Yeah.

202
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,600
Next he will win.

203
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:16,190
Who knows how to handle both
superior and inferior forces.

204
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:22,780
He will win whose army is animated by
the same spirit throughout all ranks.

205
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:25,900
Okay,

206
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,520
so if you're in a leadership position at,

207
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:30,880
you got part of your team on board
with the program, not good enough.

208
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,810
You've got to get the whole
team on board with the program.

209
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,070
That's who's going to win.

210
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,240
Okay.

211
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,980
He will win. Who prepared
himself, prepared himself,

212
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,070
waits to take the enemy unprepared.

213
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:51,590
I'm just going to wait until you're not
ready. Why would I square up? You know,

214
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,800
why would I do that? If you're ready
to fight me, I'm not going to go.

215
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,920
Let's just wait till
you're not expecting it.

216
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,290
Yeah.
Along with that emotional

217
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,400
kind of state that some
people are in where they,

218
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:09,580
where they don't exercise these types
of strategies along with the emotional

219
00:14:10,011 --> 00:14:14,060
state is the ego to stickle state.
You know, the guy who was like, Hey,

220
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,840
I'm just going to stand toe to toe. And
you're like, all right. That's tough.

221
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,310
That's, that's, you know, that might,

222
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:24,590
it might make for a show in a
fighting MMA situation in it.

223
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,030
But as far as the strategy to win,
that's again,

224
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,320
it's cool for the show. But as far
as winning, actually winning, um,

225
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,120
it might not be the best. We'll just
say that. Yeah, I would agree with you.

226
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,420
Yeah.

227
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,360
Number five,
he will win.

228
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:48,130
Who has military capacity and is not
interfered with by the sovereign.

229
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:49,920
Okay.

230
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,640
Victory lies in the, of those
five points. So that means you,

231
00:14:53,641 --> 00:14:58,370
you can't get micromanaged.
If you're being micromanaged
by the, by higher powers,

232
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,870
you're going to have problems.

233
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,840
And here's the classic classic
saying that everyone's heard.

234
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,900
Hence the saying,
if you know the enemy and know yourself,

235
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:15,320
you need not fear the
result of a hundred battles.

236
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,390
If you know yourself, but not the
enemy, for every victory gained,

237
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,910
you will off also suffer a defeat.

238
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,230
If you know neither
the enemy nor yourself,

239
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,320
you will succumb in every battle.

240
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,290
So you got to know yourself and that's
the one that you know, that's, that's you,

241
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:43,280
that's your team. That's you.
That's why you got to learn.

242
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:45,050
That's why you've got to study.
That's why you got to train.

243
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,720
That's why you got to test yourself too.

244
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,900
It's why you got to put pressure on
yourself because you don't know yourself

245
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,780
unless you put yourself into
those situations. Yup. Physically,

246
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,030
mentally stress.

247
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,760
That's what you want to go into
so that you know yourself. Yeah.

248
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,870
When we used to send CEO Paul,
when we sent the opportunities over seas,

249
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,490
they know what their limitations are.

250
00:16:04,491 --> 00:16:08,540
They been tested hard
individually and as a unit. Yeah.

251
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:14,750
Going on son Sue said, and this is
actually that's a quote from the book,

252
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:18,080
so I guess he must've wrote that
because this is a allegedly a literal

253
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:22,970
translation of the of of Sun Tzu and so
he starts off his statements with Sun.

254
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:23,804
Sue said

255
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:30,610
the good fighters of old put first put
themselves beyond the possibility of

256
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:35,651
defeat and then waited for an opportunity
of defeating the enemy to secure

257
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:39,950
ourselves against a feat
lies in our own hands,

258
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,690
but the opportunity of defeating the
enemy is provided by the enemy himself.

259
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,280
So he's going to talk about that more
and it is laced throughout this book that

260
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,990
you got to focus on your game.

261
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,200
You got to focus on your what you can do
in the situation now worried about them

262
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:59,060
but like what can I do to be prepared,

263
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,510
put myself beyond the
possibility of defeat.

264
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:10,880
Hence the skillful fighter puts himself
into a position which makes defeat

265
00:17:10,881 --> 00:17:15,881
impossible and does not miss the moment
for defeating the enemy going on,

266
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,440
son Sue said

267
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:24,960
the control of a large force is the same
in principle as the control of a few

268
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:31,180
men. It is merely a question
of dividing up their numbers.

269
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:38,140
Now when I wrote about that and Lafe
and I talk about that all the time,

270
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,880
that's decentralized command,

271
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:45,500
dividing up the numbers and
having subordinate leadership,

272
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:50,040
running the teams and having sub more
did leadership inside teams running

273
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,290
smaller teams.
That's all it is.

274
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,290
The principle of control is the same.

275
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:01,560
Now we get into a little bit of
direct versus indirect. Again,

276
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:03,960
a topic that I talk about all the time

277
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,950
in all fighting the direct method
bay may be used for joining battle,

278
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,090
but indirect methods will be
needed in order to secure victory.

279
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:21,380
Indirect tactics efficiently applied
are inexhaustible as heaven and earth on

280
00:18:23,131 --> 00:18:27,930
ending as the flow of rivers and
streams like the sun and moon.

281
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,801
They end,

282
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:33,801
but to begin a new like the four seasons
they pass but to return once more.

283
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,770
So he's talking about how when you
get to indirect hacks, there's there,

284
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,270
there are infinite numbers, infinite
numbers of ways to approach things.

285
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:49,270
There are not more than five musical
notes yet. The combination of these. Note,

286
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,230
these five give rise to more
melodies than can ever be heard.

287
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,430
There are not more than five
primary colors yet in combination.

288
00:18:57,431 --> 00:18:59,830
They produce more huge
than can ever be seen.

289
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:05,350
There are not more than five cardinal
tastes yet combinations of them yield

290
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,280
flavors,

291
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,600
more flavors than can
ever be tasted in battle.

292
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,660
There are not more than
two methods of attack.

293
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,880
The direct and indirect,

294
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:21,490
yet these two in combination give rise
to an endless series of maneuvers.

295
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:26,350
The direct and indirect lead
on to each other intern.

296
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,110
It is like a moving circle.

297
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:34,260
You never come to an end who can exhaust
the possibilities of their combination.

298
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,313
Yeah,

299
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,130
he went a little,
he would descriptive right there.

300
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:46,370
He was obviously convinced as I am to
that even though there's basic maneuvers,

301
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,330
the the way that you
apply them is limitless

302
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,260
and that's one of the things
that makes leadership hard.

303
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,930
Cause when you're dealing with
people, I mean there's, there's,

304
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:01,440
there's a certain number of types of
personalities you got to deal with,

305
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,670
but then those personalities are all
mixed together in a way that you have to

306
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,460
react to them and treat
them a certain way and

307
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,310
how the two are the same and then you
have to deal with how they interact with

308
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:15,300
each other as well.

309
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:20,040
And then not to mention the fact that
they may or may not change as individual

310
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:24,600
as the day goes on. As the day
goes on, they start getting hungry,

311
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:26,820
they start getting
angry. Yeah, right. Well,

312
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,210
well maybe they just watched a romantic
comedy and they're feeling a little

313
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:33,440
different. Let's hope that's
not the case or whatever.

314
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,140
I Dunno why I think romantic.
All right.

315
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,320
Back to Sun Su Sun sue said,

316
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,600
whoever is in the first,

317
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:46,380
in the field and awaits the coming of
the enemy will be fresh for the fight.

318
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,980
Whoever second in

319
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,180
the field and has to hasten to
the battle will arrive exhausted.

320
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,200
Therefore, the clever combatant
imposes his will on the enemy,

321
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,980
but does not allow the enemy's
will to be imposed on him.

322
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,610
Hear that all the time in MMA. Who's
going to impose their will on this fight?

323
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,833
Hmm.

324
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,600
By holding out advantages to him,

325
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:13,310
he can cause the enemy to approach of
his own accord. That's Bait, right?

326
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:18,410
Or by inflicting damage, he can make it
impossible for the enemy to draw near.

327
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,630
If the enemy is taking his ease,
meaning if the enemy's trying to rest,

328
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:28,670
he can harass him. If well
supplied, he can starve them out.

329
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,360
If quietly and camped,
he can force him to move.

330
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,230
So all these are just little things
to basically annoy the enemy, right?

331
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,420
Throw him off his game,
throw him off of his game.

332
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:43,990
Appear at points which the enemy must
hasten to defend march swiftly to places

333
00:21:44,691 --> 00:21:46,460
where you are not expected.

334
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,190
Okay.

335
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,800
And Army May march great
distances without distress.

336
00:21:50,801 --> 00:21:53,230
If he marches through country
where the enemy is not,

337
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,290
you can be sure of it's of
succeeding in your attacks.

338
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,440
If you attack places
which are not defended,

339
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:07,450
totally obvious, right? You can
be sure of succeeding in your tax.

340
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,340
If you attack places
which are not defended.

341
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,860
And this is something that
we do in Jujitsu, you know,
you're attacking the NAC,

342
00:22:14,861 --> 00:22:17,350
you're attacking the NAC,
they're protecting the neck
there. Protect the neck,

343
00:22:17,351 --> 00:22:20,550
boom arm or you're going for Camille,
you're going to freaking mirror,

344
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,150
you're going for Canberra. Boom. Straight
arm mock other arm. Yeah. Big One is you,

345
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,190
when you fake a submission to go
for a guard pass or something,

346
00:22:30,191 --> 00:22:33,940
that's not a submission, you know?
Yeah. Cause it, it throws your mind off.

347
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,040
Like Greg does it really well where he'll
go for that guillotine and you're like,

348
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:43,060
oh he's going for a submission. So your
mind, it's one thing to be like, okay,

349
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:48,150
I see he's going from my neck and
then get my arm could be exposed.

350
00:22:48,251 --> 00:22:49,870
It's, that's one thing
because you're thinking, okay,

351
00:22:49,871 --> 00:22:52,780
this submission to this next
submission, but if it's, you know,

352
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:54,670
if they're going for something
completely different,

353
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:58,570
different aspect of the game,
it throws you off even more.

354
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,060
He's got me with that like three
times in a row before. Yeah.

355
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:05,230
That's basically going to even further
to the flank. Yeah. Yang, some, you know,

356
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,890
you're expecting this,
somebody to shoot you with a machine gun.

357
00:23:08,891 --> 00:23:12,250
They start lobbing mortars at you.
Yeah. You weren't ready for that at all.

358
00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:15,920
Or they start like taking
your guys' hostage it in the,

359
00:23:15,921 --> 00:23:17,980
went back through the back door
or something like that. You know?

360
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,360
Completely different.
Yeah.

361
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,210
You can ensure the safety of your defense
if you hold only positions that cannot

362
00:23:25,211 --> 00:23:27,610
be attacked. How obvious is that? Yeah.

363
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:32,260
Let's just get in positions where we
can't be attacked and then we will defend

364
00:23:32,261 --> 00:23:33,094
them very easily.

365
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,093
Okay.

366
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:41,300
The spot where we intend to
fight must not be made known for.

367
00:23:41,311 --> 00:23:44,880
Then the enemy will have to prepare
against a possible attack at several

368
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,830
different points,

369
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:50,930
and his forces being thus
distributed in many directions.

370
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:54,830
The numbers we shall have to face at
any given point will be proportionately,

371
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:55,664
phew.

372
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,250
So you don't want to let the enemy know
where you're gonna attack him because

373
00:23:58,251 --> 00:23:59,690
then he can defend that specific area.

374
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,610
Whereas if he has to
defend all of his areas,

375
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,970
he's got less people defending
where you're going to attack.

376
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:09,790
We did that really well in World
War II, the d day, you know they,

377
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,770
the Germans did not know. They were
suspect where we were going to attack,

378
00:24:12,771 --> 00:24:14,090
but they didn't know it was Normandy,

379
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,710
so they had a lot of defenses strewed
about and other areas and costume.

380
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,693
Okay.

381
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,640
Now here we go with how we
deal with what the enemy does.

382
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,970
Four should the enemy's
strength in his van,

383
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:34,010
which van is like the division at the
front. It's the front of your troops van.

384
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,330
That's why they like the term fan.
Guard is like your front front guard.

385
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,110
Four should the enemy strengthen his van?

386
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,770
He will weakened his rear
should he strengthened his rear,

387
00:24:45,771 --> 00:24:49,670
he will weaken his van. Should
he strengthened his left?
He will. Weaken is right.

388
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:52,340
Should he strengthened his right?
He will weakened his left.

389
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,640
If he sends reinforcements everywhere,

390
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,730
he will be everywhere week

391
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:03,840
and that's what you know. Again,
going into Jujitsu when someone is,

392
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:08,250
when you feel in passing and they're
locking you and they're thinking about a

393
00:25:08,251 --> 00:25:09,350
knee lock and [inaudible],

394
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:12,000
they got all those things going on at
the same time and you're just trying to

395
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:15,540
spread your defenses then then when they
do one of those three you're in trouble

396
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,460
and I always explained to people,
you know when you, it's easy,

397
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,200
it's pretty easy for anybody.

398
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:25,080
If you tell me how I'm going to try and
straighten out your arm and that's my

399
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:28,230
whole focus is to stop you for straighten
my arm. It's you know, I can do it.

400
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,780
I can do it pretty well.
I'm well defended on that area.

401
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:34,620
There is no opening somewhere else. Right
and the same thing with guard passing.

402
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,900
If I'm trying to pass
your guard all tight,

403
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,920
low and heavy and you're just
defending, defending, defending,

404
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,400
that means there's an opening somewhere
else probably far away from you. Yeah,

405
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,760
super common one with guard passing
is you know, you smashed to the,

406
00:25:47,761 --> 00:25:49,440
you know one side, right? You're smashing,

407
00:25:49,441 --> 00:25:52,740
smashing to one site and then you hop
your hip though to the other site wide

408
00:25:52,741 --> 00:25:54,420
open all the time.
And the harder you smashed,

409
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:59,160
the more wide open that far side is. Yeah,
that's a common one. Yeah. It's just a,

410
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,650
it's just a distraction.
And then a flank,

411
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,170
son Sue's been doing it for 2,500 years.
Ang.

412
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:13,140
All right. Do not repeat the
tactics would you have gained?

413
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:14,430
Okay,

414
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:18,920
you're on victory. Do not repeat the
tactics which have gained you won victory,

415
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:24,110
but let your methods be regulated by
the infinite variety of circumstances.

416
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,540
Okay.

417
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:30,540
Military tactics are like unto water for
water in its natural course runs away

418
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:36,280
from high places and hastens downward.
So in war,

419
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,570
the way to avoid what is strong
is to strike what is weak.

420
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,150
Now, this is something that we
definitely got raised within seal teams.

421
00:26:47,151 --> 00:26:50,930
You don't use the same methodology over
and over and over again and development

422
00:26:50,931 --> 00:26:54,380
pattern. You don't do it no matter
how minor you change things up,

423
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:58,700
you change things up. And that's something
that any good military unit does.

424
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:03,140
It's something that any, anybody
that's uh, being, uh, threatened.

425
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:07,370
You know, if your life is in danger,
you don't set a pattern on what you do,

426
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,510
you change it up.

427
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,653
Hmm.

428
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:15,400
Water shapes its course according
to the ground over which it flows.

429
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:21,810
The soldier works out his victory in
relation to the Foa whom he is facing,

430
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:27,670
therefore,
just as water retains no constant shape.

431
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,110
So when warfare,
there are no constant conditions.

432
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,320
You got to have an open mind.

433
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,430
You can't get trapped
inside your own tactics.

434
00:27:41,431 --> 00:27:43,800
You can't get trapped
inside your own game.

435
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:47,190
And I see this with businesses we work
with, with companies that we work with,

436
00:27:47,191 --> 00:27:51,450
where they have got their thing that
they've done and they've been successful

437
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,190
for six years running,

438
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:58,290
and then all of a sudden something
changes and they're trying to run the same

439
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:03,150
methodology without ever stepping back
and saying, wait a second. We did well.

440
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:06,600
We had a 12% growth average
for the past six years,

441
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:11,310
and all of a sudden we're
down 22%. What happened? Well,

442
00:28:11,311 --> 00:28:16,220
let's just do what we did before again
and again. That's what, that's what,

443
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:19,170
how people spiral into a bankruptcy.
Why?

444
00:28:19,171 --> 00:28:21,690
Because the conditions change,

445
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:25,800
the conditions change field and they
don't look and say, oh, the enemy adapted,

446
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:28,020
the competitor's adapted.
You know,

447
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,600
we can look at some of these
businesses that have gone on. I mean,

448
00:28:30,601 --> 00:28:35,420
the music industry has
changed dramatically. No cds.

449
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:39,750
I mean, imagine if you owned a CD
production warehouse somewhere. I mean,

450
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:44,250
you wouldn't [inaudible] cds. Yeah.
Tower records. Classic example. Yeah.

451
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:48,300
Yeah. And, and back to the
[inaudible] doing the same

452
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:53,160
thing over and over again. Like, you know,
if you succeed with this one, you know,

453
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,040
method, it's like salespeople,
salespeople, they really
low. A lot of them,

454
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,130
they really look at sales as
this kind of war. You know,

455
00:29:01,131 --> 00:29:02,660
it's me get someone makes the sale.

456
00:29:02,661 --> 00:29:05,810
Either you sell them your product or they
sell you why they can't buy whatever.

457
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:11,110
Um, when you see as a
consumer, when you see the low,

458
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:14,300
especially from sales people directly,
when you see the same

459
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:20,060
language over and over, after a while you
like, I see exactly what you're doing.

460
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,380
I see what you're doing.
You know how they ask you.

461
00:29:21,381 --> 00:29:25,310
They'll ask you a question that if you
say no to you look dumb or something like

462
00:29:25,311 --> 00:29:29,850
that. Yeah. So I dunno if they say
yes 15 times in a row and then yeah,

463
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:32,020
they'd be like, oh obviously
right. And you're like, I can't,

464
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,280
you kind of feel like you can't say no,
but after a while you're like,

465
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:37,010
I see what you're doing.
You know, so let me work.

466
00:29:37,011 --> 00:29:40,160
Cause then they probably teach them
that, you know? So if it's like, oh yeah,

467
00:29:40,161 --> 00:29:41,800
that works. That's,
that works. That works.

468
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:46,960
But yeah, it was starting to get hip
to it. Stuff won't work anymore. Not,

469
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:49,260
it's definitely not gonna work on
that cove, Charles. No, no, no.

470
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:52,990
I see what you're doing. I see
what you guys are doing. All right.

471
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,360
And this is just restating the same thing.

472
00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:00,630
He who can modify his tactics in relation
to his opponent and thereby succeed in

473
00:30:00,641 --> 00:30:04,600
winning may be called
a heaven born captain.

474
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:10,680
So if you can look at what your opponent's
doing, and this is something that,

475
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,940
again, I see companies do it.
I see Jujitsu players do it.

476
00:30:14,941 --> 00:30:17,820
They have that one thing that they're
used to and then someone's really good at

477
00:30:17,821 --> 00:30:20,520
defending that one thing and they just
keep going against to keep going against,

478
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:24,570
to keep going against it and keep
running into that brick wall and it's not

479
00:30:24,571 --> 00:30:27,720
going to get you where you want
to be. Yeah, it's problematic.

480
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:33,750
Here we go from Sun Su, a soldier
spirit, his keenest in the morning.

481
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:39,770
By noon day it has begun to flag and
in the evening his mind is bent only on

482
00:30:41,071 --> 00:30:44,070
returning to camp.
A clever,

483
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:49,340
a clever general therefore avoids an
army when it's spirit is keen but attacks

484
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,880
when is sluggish and in
Thai inclined to return.

485
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,080
This is the art of studying moods.

486
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:04,020
I liked that. The Art of studying
moods. This is about knowing people.

487
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:05,581
Yeah.

488
00:31:05,581 --> 00:31:09,660
That kind of like the guy in Jujitsu
class who shows up 15 minutes before the

489
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:12,240
class ends when everyone's
been rolling. Yeah. Yeah.

490
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:16,650
He's getting everyone on
there and sluggish, threatened
to go back to camp like,

491
00:31:16,651 --> 00:31:18,870
hey guys,
want to roll off fresh?

492
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:20,863
Yeah.

493
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,640
It is a military axiom not to advance
uphill against the enemy nor to oppose him

494
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,020
when he comes downhill.

495
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,150
Do not pursue an enemy
who simulates flight.

496
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,380
Do not attack soldiers
whose temper is keen.

497
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,490
Do not swallow a bait
offered by the enemy.

498
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:49,330
Do not interfere with an army
that's returning home as a good one.

499
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,930
They're going, they're running.
Let them run. Let them go home.

500
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,700
They're going to fight hard to get home,
right?

501
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,770
They got visions of their
family and their head.

502
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:03,500
When you surround an army,
leave an outlet free.

503
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:07,700
Do not press a desperate photo too hard,

504
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,950
and this is something you
see psychologically a lot.
You know with an argument,

505
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:18,250
you got a couple of executives and maybe
the senior executive has a plan and no

506
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:21,530
one likes the plan.
Well,

507
00:32:21,531 --> 00:32:24,800
you just don't want to box him in and
prove them wrong in front of everybody,

508
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:28,280
right? You don't want to do
that. You want to be crafty.

509
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,080
We want to get yourself sued together.

510
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,280
You want to leave them a little opening
where he can say, you know what?

511
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:35,870
After reconsidering,

512
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,250
I've decided I want to go with this
other way because figured out that

513
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,670
blah, blah, blah. I
give them an out. Yeah.

514
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:48,070
What you don't want to do is make him
stick to this bad plan because his ego is

515
00:32:49,131 --> 00:32:50,140
making them stick there.

516
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:52,973
Yeah.

517
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,570
Recognize,

518
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,053
okay.

519
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:04,320
Do not linger in dangerously
isolated positions

520
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,720
when you're doing Jujitsu.
Don't,

521
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:13,200
when someone gets across side,
you scramble, you go crazy.

522
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,310
Don't let him settle there.

523
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,300
When somebody is trying to get that
Kogi color up underneath your head and

524
00:33:18,301 --> 00:33:21,960
they're going to have you trapped.
Don't let them get there. Don't,

525
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:26,550
don't linger in dangerously
isolated positions. Move. Yeah.

526
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:31,980
Yeah. It's W it's, it gets so complex
with this and in Jujitsu worked.

527
00:33:31,981 --> 00:33:34,980
So just get considered what, just what
you said, because this is kind of,

528
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,620
it kind of overflows into the another
part that you just talked about.

529
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:41,670
So let's say the example of the guy
passing your guard into your site control.

530
00:33:41,671 --> 00:33:46,380
Right. During his pass you said
don't let him settle. Exactly. So,

531
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:49,500
but when he, let's say whatever, you
lose the fight for whatever reason,

532
00:33:49,501 --> 00:33:50,550
any does settle.

533
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,650
Now you're faced with a situation
where if he settled on you hard,

534
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:56,191
where he's,

535
00:33:56,191 --> 00:34:00,120
you can tell he's putting strength into
holding that position and you then you

536
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,910
try to scramble, you're going against,
you're going full speed, you know,

537
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:07,950
toe to toe like Oh, he said not to do. So
at that point you got a change strategy.

538
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,490
If you had, had already lost that battle,
you and he settled and he's putting his,

539
00:34:11,491 --> 00:34:13,710
his energy into holding you,

540
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:19,050
now you got to play another
tactic that he said, let him,

541
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,230
you know, you got to relax a little bit.
And so he starts relaxing a little bit.

542
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,890
You know what I mean? It's like that's
a common thing that's like, you know,

543
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,540
a pretty well known strategy,
I would say. When you,

544
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:29,760
when you get advanced and you do too,
but it's crazy how he just lays it out.

545
00:34:29,761 --> 00:34:33,990
And that's the perfect
exact exact example. Yeah.

546
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:38,160
All in one little one little move,
one little movement.

547
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,630
And actually he continues on that.
Same,

548
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:47,870
on that same thread in
hemmed in situations.

549
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:52,500
In other words, when you're surrounded
in your, you're under the bad situation,

550
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:57,180
you must resort to stratagem and
stratagem doesn't really mean strategy.

551
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,980
It means like tricks or deceptions.
So you've,

552
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,280
you've given up, you've, you've,
you've given up your position.

553
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:09,090
The person is dominating you now and
exactly what you're saying is correct.

554
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,520
When someone has got you in that position,

555
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:16,680
either in an argument or a plan or a
situation that you're in a relationship,

556
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:21,200
they've got you locked down,
stop fighting. Yup. You,

557
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:26,250
it's not going to work. You're, they've
got you. If you continue to struggle,

558
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:27,270
you just going to wear yourself out.

559
00:35:27,271 --> 00:35:31,830
You're going to worsen the scenario
stop and now you have to start thinking

560
00:35:31,831 --> 00:35:34,310
about a trick to get out of there.
So I'm kind of a better tactic,

561
00:35:34,311 --> 00:35:37,890
some kind of a deception,
something to get you out of there because

562
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,530
going strength to strength isn't going
to do it. They're in a superior position.

563
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:42,781
You know,

564
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:46,980
sometimes you can tell someone's doing
that if you have them in a situation and

565
00:35:46,981 --> 00:35:50,550
they start actually using this tactic.
Little strict, a little tricks.

566
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:56,100
One that I've been able to recognize
is they do like some ad Hominem fucking

567
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,890
argument. They'll start
attacking something else. Yeah,
yeah, of course. But it's a,

568
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,990
yeah. If you, if you kind of have
a handle on the whole situation,

569
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:07,590
it's real obvious. Yeah.
Yeah. And then he says,

570
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,470
in a desperate position,
you must fight.

571
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:14,670
Now the difference here is now there's a
submission. Hold on you. Yeah. No choice.

572
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,040
You have to fight. You're going to
fight fighter. You're gonna tap. Yeah.

573
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:22,790
So you get that situation where it's gone
beyond just their secure and they've,

574
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,110
they've got you in a dominant position,

575
00:36:25,111 --> 00:36:26,940
but now they're actually
going to kill you. Right.

576
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:30,270
You have no choice but to buy
the last level of settling.

577
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,920
Now this is interesting.

578
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,660
There are roads which must
not be followed. Armies,

579
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:41,370
which must not be attacked. Towns
which must not be besieged positions,

580
00:36:41,371 --> 00:36:45,570
which must not be contested
commands of the sovereign,

581
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,940
which must not be obeyed.

582
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,403
Hmm.

583
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:57,050
So it's always interesting to me when
you hear somebody that's a military

584
00:36:57,051 --> 00:37:02,051
mastermind and they're saying that there
are orders from their sovereign that

585
00:37:04,941 --> 00:37:06,860
must not be obeyed.

586
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,633
Hmm.

587
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,060
And I think we've heard that,

588
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:13,210
and this is something that people aren't
familiar with the military or aren't

589
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:16,720
familiar with military history. They think
everyone just follows. Orders, follows,

590
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:19,810
orders, follows orders. But
Napoleon we've heard say it,

591
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,280
Sun who we've heard say it.

592
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:25,480
We've heard these repeated things
where people say, you know what,

593
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,420
that's the wrong order and
I'm not going to do it.

594
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,453
Hmm.

595
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,620
And it's interesting too,

596
00:37:31,621 --> 00:37:35,490
the other dichotomy has all these people
talk about the necessity of discipline

597
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:39,570
and inherit and discipline is
absolutely the following of orders.

598
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:45,240
But as much of as stringent as I
am about discipline, hmm. If I'm,

599
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,870
I want my guys to question my worst, I
want them to say, Hey, wait a second.

600
00:37:48,871 --> 00:37:52,980
Why is Jocko making us do
this? He's, he's wrong.

601
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,080
I don't want them just obeying me blindly.

602
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,543
Hmm.

603
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:00,540
Is You don't want your team obeying
you blindly. You don't want that.

604
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,260
You want them to be
thinking back to the book.

605
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:10,860
The Art of war teaches us to rely not
on the likelihood of the enemy's not

606
00:38:11,441 --> 00:38:15,070
coming,
but on our own readiness to receive him.

607
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,370
Not on the chance of his not attacking,

608
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,720
but rather on the fact that we have
made our position on the salient ball.

609
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,150
So what that is,
again,

610
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:30,190
he's putting the the preponderance of
the outcome, not on what the enemy does,

611
00:38:30,191 --> 00:38:31,330
but on what you do.

612
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,473
Hmm.

613
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:36,130
It's not what happens is not
what happens to in your life.

614
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,910
It's what you do.
It's what's you prepare for.

615
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:44,380
It's your own readiness that's
going to affect the outcome,

616
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:47,020
not the chance of what
the enemy's done done.

617
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,900
It's how have you made your position?

618
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,640
How have you set yourself up? How have
you prepared? How have you trained?

619
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:59,090
How have you worked?
That's where the outcome comes from.

620
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,050
Not what the world does to you,
but what you do to the world.

621
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:09,370
There are five dangerous faults which
may affect a general one recklessness,

622
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:15,650
which leads to the
destruction to cowardice,

623
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,590
which leads to capture.
So those two,

624
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,890
you got one guy that's a
maniac that doesn't care.
He's going to go get after it.

625
00:39:21,891 --> 00:39:25,280
He's going to die.
You've got someone else that's a coward.

626
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:28,460
He's going to get captured.
Three,

627
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:32,780
a hasty temper that can
be provoked by insults.

628
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,290
Dangerous,

629
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:39,970
a delicacy of honor that
is sensitive to shame.

630
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,130
Sort of the same thing.

631
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,540
And then over solicitude for his men,

632
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:51,570
which exposes him to worry and
trouble and oversell a stew.

633
00:39:51,591 --> 00:39:54,790
That's basically you over affectionate.

634
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,340
You care about the men so much

635
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,140
that exposes you to worry and trouble.

636
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
These are the five per setting sins
of a general ruinous to the conquer,

637
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,490
ruinous to the conduct of war.

638
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,630
Some things to watch out for
it. It's interesting, you know,

639
00:40:18,631 --> 00:40:22,080
obviously the one that's,
that's

640
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:29,290
I guess the most controversial to me
is that over solicitude for his men,

641
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:34,190
which exposes him to worry
in trouble because you know,

642
00:40:34,191 --> 00:40:37,490
in the modern military, you know,
he was dealing with conscripts.

643
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,670
So even eat, it's interesting, even
conscripts back then he's saying, hey,

644
00:40:42,671 --> 00:40:44,600
you could get too affectionate
with your conscripts

645
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,880
and now we have brothers
and so you're gonna,

646
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,170
you're gonna care about your guys,

647
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,660
you're going to care about your guys
more than anything else in the world.

648
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:02,560
But what you have to counter
that with is not, hey,

649
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:04,300
I'm not going to care
about them. No, it's,

650
00:41:04,301 --> 00:41:08,450
I'm going to make sure I do everything I
can to keep them safe. Yeah. Yeah. I think

651
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:10,721
like,
you know how in,

652
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:15,721
in a lot of companies they discourage
fraternizing with your coworkers.

653
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:19,180
So I used to work in the nightclub
industry where, you know,

654
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,800
from time to time people would

655
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:25,970
hookup.
So what that can can

656
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,530
result in is, um, you know,

657
00:41:28,531 --> 00:41:33,531
people who are too focused on the
relationship between each versus

658
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:38,750
their job go or, yeah. So
there's a total assumption,

659
00:41:38,751 --> 00:41:41,570
but maybe that's what he's talking
about exactly what he's talking about.

660
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,490
That's exactly what he's talking about.
And,

661
00:41:43,491 --> 00:41:47,570
but if you take that into
the military scenario, it's,

662
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,520
you know,
like I said,

663
00:41:49,521 --> 00:41:52,790
you're going to care about your guys so
much and you have to counter that with

664
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:55,790
the fact that you have
a duty and you have,

665
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:00,820
you have a job and that
everybody on your team,

666
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,150
like we were in the seal teams,
you all know the risk. Yeah. Yeah.

667
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,710
Everybody knows the risk. Everybody
knows that when you go on an operation,

668
00:42:06,711 --> 00:42:10,070
it might be your last operation. You
get hit with an ID, you get shot,

669
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:11,660
you get mortared, you
get blown up. I mean,

670
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:16,870
everybody accepts that risk
and that therefore as a leader,

671
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,860
you know you're not imposing
that risk upon them.

672
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:26,450
They volunteered for that risk and I
think that's what allows a modern military

673
00:42:26,451 --> 00:42:31,160
commander to to say,
Hey, I love these guys,

674
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,100
but they all know what they signed up for.

675
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,450
There's going to be risk here and
we've got a job to do as opposed to,

676
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,970
Hey,
I love these guys.

677
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,670
They don't want to be here and I'm
going to send them to their deaths.

678
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,630
That would not,

679
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:47,980
that would be a different scenario or
harder scenario or you got clothes.

680
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,260
Let's say you know you're, you're
in command of you know, 10 guys,

681
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:56,240
five of those guys are your best friends
and you get too attached in the sense

682
00:42:56,390 --> 00:43:00,830
that you have a mission that you have to
do a dangerous one, but you're like, Hey,

683
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:04,850
I'm not going to send those five guys
because they're going to be at risk.

684
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:08,440
I want to keep them safe, you know,
so I don't want to send them there.

685
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:12,860
The other five guys go rather than the
10. And you know, messes up your whole,

686
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:17,660
your whole job. Which oddly enough,
I always sent like the guys,

687
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:21,050
I love it. Worst
scenario, all my brothers,

688
00:43:21,051 --> 00:43:25,400
they would be lining up and
saying, I'm going, I'm going.
I was fired up. Siva. Yeah.

689
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:26,234
I mean,
you're obviously

690
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:31,980
very specific type of person and you guys
probably are too, I would imagine. Um,

691
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:38,120
but still it, you're still
exercising that discipline between,

692
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:43,490
you know, them potentially going to their
death and that job you guys have to do.

693
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,940
So you're, you're thinking of it in a
smarter way. Know what's interesting,

694
00:43:46,941 --> 00:43:49,460
I just thought of this like if a guy
got in trouble for whatever reason,

695
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:53,720
when we were over on deployment,
whenever I was on deployment combat,

696
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,180
if a guy got in trouble,
you know what their punishment would be.

697
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:00,310
You're not allowed to go on a mission.
I know.

698
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,290
So just so that just tells you what
kind of an attitude. Yeah. You know,

699
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,360
the guys that we're working
with, it's like, oh,

700
00:44:05,361 --> 00:44:07,970
you can't go on these next three missions.
Yeah,

701
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:13,020
guys are angry because they realize
they're letting their buddies down and if

702
00:44:13,521 --> 00:44:16,580
something goes wrong and they're not
there, it's a nightmare. Yeah. And their,

703
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,450
their, their duty, their job is,
is it's part of them. You know,

704
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:23,620
where I was listening to this thing
where he's talking about this,

705
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:26,840
the Amish Amish people. Right. And
they're really into work, you know,

706
00:44:26,841 --> 00:44:30,290
hard work and stuff. So one of the
punishments for the kids would be,

707
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,130
you're not allowed work.
Yeah. It's the same.

708
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,850
It's like saying it's like there.
Yeah. Same thing. Yeah. Meanwhile,

709
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:40,110
my kids, I got a beat them senseless
to get them to do any work.

710
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:44,370
Just kidding.
Just kidding.

711
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,340
But I guarantee they're not working as
hard as some Amish kid out in the field.

712
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:54,400
Yeah. Putting up buildings with the
wood nails that they do. I mean, yeah.

713
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:59,080
It's awesome. Yeah. The work is obviously
part of their identity, you know, so like,

714
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,560
you know,
it's certain things people,

715
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:06,910
let's say quote unquote
normal people might find like,
like exercise for example.

716
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:10,420
Like if, so if let's say you're just an
average person who's like, man, I got to,

717
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:12,070
I'm going to make a new year's resolution.

718
00:45:12,071 --> 00:45:14,020
I'm going to lose some weight or whatever,
I'm going to get a trainer.

719
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,440
It's hard for them. It's worked for them.
Right? So if the trainers like, Hey,

720
00:45:17,441 --> 00:45:21,580
today's rest day, and they'd be like, oh,
sweet. You know, but then you take you,

721
00:45:21,581 --> 00:45:25,300
for example, like how you were
saying your wife is like, hey,

722
00:45:25,301 --> 00:45:28,300
maybe don't go to Jujitsu today.
You're all pissed. Yeah. You know?

723
00:45:28,301 --> 00:45:31,710
So it's the exact opposite. But, so
that's kind of the, the scenario when it,

724
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:33,160
when it's ingrained in you and the,

725
00:45:33,161 --> 00:45:36,670
and it starts to become part of your
identity work or not work. You want to,

726
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,320
you want to get that done.
Yeah.

727
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:43,510
That's interesting how those,
those embedded feelings,

728
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:48,250
yeah. Developing your life.
But what an awesome deal.

729
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,500
Like, if you think about
that, we would actually,

730
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:54,250
if we had to punish our guys would
punish them by saying you can't go on to

731
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:58,320
missions. Perfect. It'd be angry.
Maybe both. It, it'd be let down.

732
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,730
They'd like help everyone get ready
and they'd stand there whenever it was

733
00:46:00,731 --> 00:46:04,660
leaving and learn their lesson
for sure. Heard him. Hold on.

734
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:07,910
All right,

735
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,910
next when the enemy is close
at hand and remains quiet,

736
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,070
he is relying on the natural
strength of his position.

737
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:25,000
This is a good one. So when you,
when you're, when you're in Jujitsu,

738
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:28,270
when someone for instance pulls
guard real quick, you know,

739
00:46:28,271 --> 00:46:32,460
they've got a good guard. You know,
when someone's like all standing up and,

740
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,770
and all upright and reaching for your
color while you're standing, you know,

741
00:46:35,771 --> 00:46:37,510
they got some judo going on.

742
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:42,960
So it's funny how when when
people have a dominant position,

743
00:46:43,001 --> 00:46:44,590
they'll lean towards it.
Yeah.

744
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:50,470
If his place of encampment
is easy of access,

745
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:54,700
he is tendering a bait. Hmm. So if it
looks, if it looks too good to be true,

746
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:57,310
it's too good to be true.
You've got to watch that

747
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:04,060
when there is much running about,
it means that the critical moment has come

748
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:10,950
when some are advancing and
some retreating. It is a lure.

749
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,220
When soldiers stand
leaning on their spears,

750
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,500
they are faint from want to food.

751
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,480
If those who are sent to draw
water begin by drinking themselves.

752
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:24,180
The army is suffering from thirst.

753
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:29,590
If the enemy sees an advantage to
be gained and makes no effort to it,

754
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,050
the soldiers are exhausted.

755
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:37,690
If birds gather on any spot,
it is unoccupied.

756
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,530
If there is disturbance in the camp,
the general's authority is weak.

757
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:49,150
If the banners and flags are
shifted about sedition is afoot.

758
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:50,830
Yeah.

759
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:55,830
When an army feeds it's horses with
grain and kills it's cattle for food and

760
00:47:56,021 --> 00:48:00,010
when the men do not hang their cooking
pots over the campfires showing that they

761
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:01,690
will not return to their tents,

762
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:06,640
you may know that they are
determined to fight to the death.

763
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:13,320
The sight of men whispering together
in small knots and speaking and subdued

764
00:48:14,021 --> 00:48:18,400
tones points to dissatisfaction
amongst the rank and file.

765
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,040
Okay,

766
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,430
now the all those right there.

767
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,640
What I really like about those because
some of them are obviously are a little

768
00:48:25,641 --> 00:48:29,420
bit archaic, you know, people
leaning on their spears, people, uh,

769
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,280
not putting out there cooking pots.

770
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:34,340
Those aren't things that
we're going to see today.

771
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:39,370
But what's so key about this is how
observing how people act can tell you much

772
00:48:39,771 --> 00:48:42,410
more if you're paying attention
to it. Yeah. You know,

773
00:48:42,411 --> 00:48:45,410
you see people talking amongst
themselves and small group,

774
00:48:45,411 --> 00:48:48,130
there's a problem going
on. Yup. You know, the,

775
00:48:48,131 --> 00:48:52,260
those are the kinds of things
that you gotta be aware of as a,

776
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:55,430
especially as a leader when you're
in a leadership position and you,

777
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:59,270
you see and you look and you
watch and you've listened.

778
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:04,040
Cause I see some people, some leaders,
they get isolated from the troops.

779
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:07,190
They get isolated from the situation,
they get isolated from the enemy.

780
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:10,100
They're not reading what's happening.
Mm.

781
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:16,010
So you've got to have this
awareness and the sensitivity,

782
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:20,930
right. It's a sensitivity. It's a sixth
sense of, hey, something's not right here.

783
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,110
And what are you picking that up from?
Yeah.

784
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:26,240
You know when you walk in a room,

785
00:49:26,241 --> 00:49:29,870
everyone's all talking or you see it
from a distance people were talking and

786
00:49:29,871 --> 00:49:32,170
then when you either walk by or
you joined them, they are there.

787
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,460
They happen to be done
talking every single time.

788
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,460
That's not going to be a good side.
They're talking

789
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,540
back to the book.
He,

790
00:49:41,541 --> 00:49:46,541
you exercises no forethought but makes
light of his opponents is sure to be

791
00:49:46,581 --> 00:49:47,600
captured by them.

792
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:49,350
Okay?

793
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:52,980
So when you're saying all,
we'd have nothing to fear
here, we can take these guys,

794
00:49:52,981 --> 00:49:56,340
we can win that contract. We can
beat the opponent, we can win.

795
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,860
That's when you're going to be taken down.

796
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:04,710
If soldiers are punished before
they have grown attached to you,

797
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:09,330
they will not prove submissive.
And unless submissive,

798
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,370
they will be practically useless.

799
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:16,800
If when the soldiers have become attached
to you, punishments are not enforced,

800
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,520
they will still be useless.
Therefore,

801
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:24,990
soldiers must be treated in the
first instance with humanity,

802
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:28,490
but kept under control by
means of iron discipline.

803
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:31,730
This is a certain road to victory.

804
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,890
If in training soldiers commands
are habitually enforced,

805
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,290
the army will be well disciplined.

806
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:47,830
So now you do realize that Sun Su 2,500
years ago was leading humans and if you

807
00:50:50,241 --> 00:50:53,240
came out of the gate before they
knew you and you treated them bad,

808
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:55,310
they were never going to work for you.

809
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,650
They will never going to
submit to what you want to do.

810
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,673
Hmm.

811
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:01,970
And once they were attached to you,

812
00:51:01,971 --> 00:51:05,210
if you had punishments and now you had
built enough respect and then you said

813
00:51:05,211 --> 00:51:07,040
you were going to punish them
for something that they did you,

814
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,650
you set a certain standard
and then you don't hold it,

815
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:14,640
they're going to be equally useless.
Yup. Inconsistent inconsistency.

816
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:18,740
I firmly believe in if,

817
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:23,270
if in training soldiers commands
are habitually in forced,

818
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:25,520
the army will be well disciplined.

819
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:30,290
You got to stay consistent and you got
to remember that you're dealing with

820
00:51:30,291 --> 00:51:31,124
humans.

821
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:33,733
Yeah.

822
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:38,640
When common soldiers are too strong
and their officers are too weak,

823
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,310
the result is insubordination.

824
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:47,780
And this is something that I saw a couple
of times in my career where I had a

825
00:51:48,421 --> 00:51:52,650
guy that worked for me
who was a tough guy.

826
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:56,430
This happened a couple times, just
a bad ass guys. Super tough beast,

827
00:51:57,210 --> 00:52:01,800
hardcore go getter. And
when they work for me, man,

828
00:52:01,801 --> 00:52:06,250
I loved him and they did anything.
I would tell him to go, you know,

829
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:07,470
run through a brick wall.

830
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:09,900
They would start running and they
would run through the brick wall.

831
00:52:09,901 --> 00:52:13,560
They'd figured out they'd get
through that thing super hard.

832
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:15,140
Okay.

833
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:17,980
And then, uh, one guy I like,

834
00:52:17,981 --> 00:52:21,290
I went to another team and he went on
another deployment and got sent home from

835
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:26,060
deployment because he was just too much
to handle. And his support, he didn't,

836
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,490
I talked to him about he goes off,
my officers were weak.

837
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:34,360
He literally said my officers
were week. Okay. And so here is,

838
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:38,900
is like a caged animal that if you don't,

839
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:41,690
if he doesn't know who, but who are the
bosses and he doesn't respect the boss,

840
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:44,600
he's not gonna listen you, he was
the Alpha male. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

841
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,270
And when he was the Alpha Male,
he was doing whatever you want.

842
00:52:47,271 --> 00:52:51,170
It wasn't listening to these people
that were in charge of him. Hmm. Yeah.

843
00:52:51,171 --> 00:52:55,730
What is that like a like a mix of
like he doesn't,

844
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:59,510
I don't know if they look up to him,
but there's a sense of that right?

845
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:02,240
Where a if,
if your leader is,

846
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:06,260
it's just respect you had that kind of
ingrained respect and then not to mention

847
00:53:06,261 --> 00:53:10,000
on top of that you don't fear any real
consequences from him. Cause thing,

848
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:13,760
you know, it's kind of weak. I can take
whatever you can dish out kind of thing.

849
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:18,910
So it's both of those you think? Yeah.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. This one guy that,

850
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:19,910
that this happened with,

851
00:53:19,911 --> 00:53:24,911
I taught him Jujitsu and he was excited
about it in a way that I've never seen

852
00:53:25,651 --> 00:53:26,484
anyone excited,

853
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:32,140
like super happy about knowing
that you could choke people and,

854
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:35,760
and he would get into fights in the
civilian world and come and give me these

855
00:53:35,761 --> 00:53:40,440
full debriefs and ask me for
like pointers and judgment.

856
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,830
And that was,
you know,

857
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:47,040
a warrior that like to fight.
Yeah.

858
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,800
He found out that you could grab
people and then submit them.

859
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:52,350
He was super excited about it.
Like a little kid.

860
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,340
And I always say that that's kind of the,

861
00:53:54,341 --> 00:53:59,341
the risk you run with teaching people
Jujitsu cause it is like I'm going to,

862
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:03,510
it's a super power essentially because
you don't have to learn that much for it

863
00:54:03,511 --> 00:54:06,000
to be effective in this huge way.

864
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:11,010
So you know like kind of like
superman with great power comes great

865
00:54:11,011 --> 00:54:13,260
responsibility. Yeah. Yeah.

866
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:18,450
It goes on to say when the officers are
too strong and the common soldiers two

867
00:54:18,451 --> 00:54:20,790
weeks,
the result is collapse.

868
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:25,920
So when you put the super hardcore
guy over that can't modulate his,

869
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:26,970
his leadership,

870
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:30,840
he can't back off and build people
up before he starts to smash him.

871
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:34,560
You're going to get claps and that's
something you definitely got to look out

872
00:54:34,561 --> 00:54:35,010
for it.
If you,

873
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:37,410
especially if you're a super strong
leader and you come and take over a team

874
00:54:37,411 --> 00:54:39,000
that's been led by somebody that's weak,

875
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:42,540
there's a chance that the players and
the team are weak and now you've got to

876
00:54:42,541 --> 00:54:45,690
come in and you got to build them
up before you let loose your vicious

877
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:48,240
leadership power.
Right?

878
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,960
You can't just come in there with the
Iron Fist and start dropping hammers. No.

879
00:54:51,961 --> 00:54:54,690
You need to say, hey guys, all right,
let's go. Let's build this team up.

880
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:55,980
Then you can,

881
00:54:56,430 --> 00:55:01,430
you can escalate your own force as your
subordinates grow and become powerful

882
00:55:01,741 --> 00:55:06,690
themselves, but you don't want there
to be a huge gap between your power.

883
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,760
Yeah, and theirs because they
won't, they won't develop into it.

884
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:14,790
They'll just be in the shadow.
They won't grow in the shadow.

885
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,390
You got to come down and let some light
get to them and let them grow. Right

886
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:24,510
when the general was
weekend without authority,

887
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:27,810
when his orders are
not clear and distinct,

888
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:33,030
when there are no fixed duties assigned
to officers and men and the ranks are

889
00:55:33,031 --> 00:55:36,120
formed in a Slava and
Lee haphazard manner,

890
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:40,170
the result is other disorganization.

891
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,130
Okay,

892
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:43,963
pretty clear.

893
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:53,410
If fighting is sure to result in victory,
then you must fight.

894
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:56,080
Even though the ruler forbid it.

895
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,650
If fighting will not result in victory,

896
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:03,280
then you must not fight
even at the rulers bidding.

897
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,370
Once again,
disobeying the chain of command.

898
00:56:07,371 --> 00:56:11,990
Sun Sue himself disobeying
the chain of command.

899
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:12,933
Okay.

900
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:16,590
This is a big one.

901
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:22,200
The general who advances without coveting
fame had retreats without fearing

902
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:28,600
who's only thought is to protect his
country and do good service for his

903
00:56:28,601 --> 00:56:32,020
sovereign is the jewel of the kingdom.

904
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:36,700
So that guy that's not
doing this to get famous,

905
00:56:36,701 --> 00:56:40,150
that's not doing this for awards.
It's not doing this to get promoted.

906
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:45,880
It's not being brave to be promoted.
He's doing this to protect the country

907
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:52,200
or to carry out the mission, not
doing it for glory. And furthermore,

908
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:55,910
the same person can retreat
without feeling Micah disgraced.

909
00:56:55,911 --> 00:56:58,140
That means they're gonna protect their
people without going all. We can't.

910
00:56:58,170 --> 00:56:59,130
We can't fall back.

911
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:03,390
This person is the jewel of the kingdom,

912
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:08,940
the jewel of the kingdom, and it's
beautiful. Your work for people like that.

913
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:11,250
You know that what they're trying to
do, what they're trying to do, good.

914
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,300
They're trying to do their mission.

915
00:57:12,301 --> 00:57:14,550
They're trying to do good for the country
that tried to do good for the team.

916
00:57:14,551 --> 00:57:16,680
They're trying to do good for the
business. That's what we're trying to do.

917
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:20,310
They're not trying to get promoted.
They're not trying to get an award.

918
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:23,970
They're not trying to get a good
fitness report or a good evaluation.

919
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:27,360
They're trying to do a good job.
And that's why when people ask me a lot,

920
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:30,360
you know, all, I've got this boss that
wants to get the credit for everything,

921
00:57:30,361 --> 00:57:31,190
give it to them.

922
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:35,780
Yeah. Give it to them. Let them look good.

923
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:40,700
Don't do it for, don't do it for
your glory. Give that glory away.

924
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,580
It feels good to give glory way.
Give it away.

925
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:50,930
I told you he used to work
in the nightclub right back
when I was young and kind

926
00:57:50,931 --> 00:57:54,200
of the protocol would
be to, you know, we'd,

927
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:58,620
we'd work or whatever and the bartenders
would give us tips on like a little

928
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:01,880
sound clips, right? So at the end of
the week you'd be kind of pooled, right.

929
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:05,800
And we'd get some tips at the end of
the week. That's cool. Whatever. And um,

930
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:11,330
so my boss, so it was back when I first
started, my bought the head door guy,

931
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:12,920
right?
He was at the end of the week,

932
00:58:12,921 --> 00:58:16,490
he called his own little meeting
with us and we're like, all right.

933
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:20,090
So he kind of goes over some stuff.
I don't even know what it was and um,

934
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:24,170
and he busted at the end.
He's like, Oh hey guys. Uh,

935
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,670
so yeah, we have tips. So
what I did was, you know, hey,

936
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:31,210
you guys are doing a great
job. So what I did was I, I,

937
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:35,000
I took my tips and I gave it to you
guys and he kind of had this look on his

938
00:58:35,001 --> 00:58:39,230
face looking at us as if he needed us
to be like, wow, that was so great.

939
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:42,980
But you know, when the look is
so transparent, he's like, so

940
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:49,030
I was like this guy, it's like so
disingenuous. You know? Like he,

941
00:58:49,031 --> 00:58:52,880
he wanted the credit and he wanted to
speak like, aw, thank you. Thank you.

942
00:58:52,881 --> 00:58:57,380
You know, it wasn't that much by the way.
This is, you know, it's $14 each if that.

943
00:58:57,381 --> 00:58:59,960
Cause we got to divide it up anyway.
But yeah,

944
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:03,670
that was like is the clear example of
that very thing right there where he's

945
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:08,300
given us the tips. I know
what he did that, yeah. Okay.

946
00:59:08,301 --> 00:59:10,850
You lost 14,
my youngest daughter,

947
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:17,350
she does good deeds for the
sole purpose of increasing

948
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,650
birthday present Christmas present.

949
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:26,060
Does it that kind of go into a different
strategy altogether though? You know,

950
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:30,800
it's pretty, it's pretty cute. And
you see this six year old like Daddy,

951
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:37,070
I decided it would be really great if I
picked up your socks. Right. Wait, they,

952
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:40,910
since my birthday is coming.
Right. But that's a, that's
another tactic. It's like,

953
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:44,980
it's called for a super cool something
like when you do something and then, yeah,

954
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:50,210
yeah, yeah. But what that it's
effective. W uh, uh, heart
accretion is used to do it.

955
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:53,720
They'd be like, you know
what? Hey, hey, um, you know
what? Whatever their messages.

956
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:56,460
And they'd be like, Hey, take this free
gift. And they give you like, I dunno,

957
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,170
a flower or a book or something and
they know that that will leave you,

958
01:00:00,171 --> 01:00:03,620
that the typical person, they'd leave them
with a feeling of Dang. Like I kind of,

959
01:00:03,621 --> 01:00:07,820
Oh, this person, he, he was so nice to
me. I can't just walk off and be a Dick,

960
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,930
you know, so I'll give you
five bucks or dollar. Yeah.

961
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:14,060
Especially when you
recognize they're doing it.

962
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,050
In fact that you do yourself a disservice
to fall for it because they're going

963
01:00:17,051 --> 01:00:20,120
to keep doing it. You know? It's basically
guilting someone in to do something,

964
01:00:20,121 --> 01:00:24,530
but it's called a reciprocal
recipe. I don't know. Something
reciprocal, something.

965
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:27,890
Well, I guess we'll look that up
and figure it out later. Otherwise,

966
01:00:27,891 --> 01:00:32,110
what's called reciprocal something.
Yeah.

967
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:36,080
All right. Now, here we go. This is
speaking to kids. This is awesome.

968
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:42,140
Regard your soldiers as your children
and they will follow you into the deepest

969
01:00:42,141 --> 01:00:42,974
valleys.

970
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:48,580
Look on them as your own beloved sons
and they will stand by you even unto

971
01:00:49,341 --> 01:00:50,174
death.

972
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,120
Completely true statement,
completely true statement.

973
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:03,720
If however,
you are indulgent,

974
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:08,970
been unable to make your
authority felt kind hearted,

975
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:14,090
but unable to enforce your commands and
incapable moreover of quelling disorder,

976
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:20,610
then your soldiers must be
likened to spoil children.

977
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:25,050
They are useless for
any practical purpose.

978
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:34,450
I think that speaks for itself.
If you are so lenient with your troops,

979
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:39,290
when they say indulgent, that's what I
mean to me to like super lenient. Yeah.

980
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:43,390
When you're lenient with your troops,
when you can't make your authority felt,

981
01:01:43,391 --> 01:01:47,740
when you're super kind hearted,
you're unable to enforce your commands,

982
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:52,720
all those things are gonna end up with
a spoiled little kids for troopers and

983
01:01:52,721 --> 01:01:57,460
they're not gonna, they're
gonna be worthless. I got
a little saying about kids,

984
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:02,290
lay it on me. If you had, if you're
helping them, you're hurting them.

985
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:08,860
Think about it. If you're helping
them, you're hurting them. Yeah.

986
01:02:09,070 --> 01:02:12,160
You want me to tie your shoe,
tie yourself because what?

987
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:16,080
That when they tie their
shoes that literally, uh,

988
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:19,860
trains their fine motor skills.

989
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:23,880
If you want them, you know,
if they want a glass of water,

990
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:26,240
go get your own glass of water.
Right?

991
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:30,570
They want help moving
something across the hallway.

992
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:34,200
You move it across the hallway.
If you're helping your kids,

993
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:38,670
you're hurting your kids. Right. And I
could take it one step further and say,

994
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:40,480
if you're hurting your kids,
you're helping kids.

995
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:44,970
I'm not going to do that few far.
Really. I do think about that.

996
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:48,660
When your kids ask you for
something, you got to say, okay,

997
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,330
is this something they can do themselves?
Even if it's a struggle for them,

998
01:02:51,331 --> 01:02:52,420
even if it's a challenge for them.

999
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:57,090
I mean for a while my daughter was late
for school and Oh can you just tie my

1000
01:02:57,091 --> 01:03:01,860
shoes? No, I can't tie your shoes.
You can tie your shoes. Right.

1001
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:05,250
And that's when they work on their fine
motor skills and that's when they learn

1002
01:03:05,251 --> 01:03:09,000
that they can, that they have to get the
skill and they become more self reliant.

1003
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:10,820
Yeah. Yeah. Fully in.

1004
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:15,840
And obviously I'm not going to wage some
kind of semantical battle with you or

1005
01:03:15,841 --> 01:03:18,330
nothing like that, but it depends
on what you mean by help. So that,

1006
01:03:18,331 --> 01:03:21,840
and I talked about this before, where
you have systemic help, indirect help.

1007
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:25,380
So systemic health is exactly what
you're doing. Tie your own shoes.

1008
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:26,370
How about you?

1009
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:31,370
How about I teach you to tie your shoes
or how would I prepare you for this shoe

1010
01:03:31,531 --> 01:03:35,940
tying world that you're about to
embark in? That's systemic health.

1011
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:40,590
That's the real help in my opinion.
Same thing. Like a homeless person.

1012
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:43,740
You give a homeless person a dollar
that's direct health, that doesn't help,

1013
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:45,630
that's hurting them as you would.
So what is that called?

1014
01:03:45,631 --> 01:03:50,040
Direct cal direct to give your children
direct around Systemic Hill you,

1015
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:54,780
your job is to prepare
kids to do everything I do.
That's in a perfect world.

1016
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,730
Everything on their own
by the time they will,

1017
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:00,840
and you actually can prepare a human to
do everything on their own because at

1018
01:04:00,841 --> 01:04:05,010
least you prepare them to face a
challenge. Research how to overcome it,

1019
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:09,210
practice overcoming it and then overcome
it. It's so easy if you teach them,

1020
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:12,180
if you, if you teach them, you know,

1021
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:14,580
you say you can give them a fish
or you can teach them how to fish,

1022
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:17,220
you can teach them to learn
how to fish on their own.

1023
01:04:17,221 --> 01:04:22,110
That's what you really want to do.
Yes. That on a tee shirt. Yeah,

1024
01:04:22,111 --> 01:04:25,920
that's it. That's absolutely correct.
Great. So if you go the more systemic,

1025
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:30,770
you could probably end up breaking it
down into maybe three things and you know,

1026
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:32,040
whatever those things are,

1027
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:34,530
I know they're going to have
something to do with how to think,

1028
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:35,910
how to manage your emotions,

1029
01:04:35,911 --> 01:04:40,110
how to adapt a lot of the real basic
things that are going to in one way or

1030
01:04:40,111 --> 01:04:42,450
another, apply to everything. Yeah,

1031
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:46,950
it's interesting that you go from,
this isn't back in the book.

1032
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:49,940
I went back to the conversation back to
the book then. It's funny how you're,

1033
01:04:49,941 --> 01:04:53,310
you're talking about Sun Tzu or to
war and we're talking about kids,

1034
01:04:53,311 --> 01:04:57,210
we're talking about business,
talking about nightclubs,

1035
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:01,980
talking about Jujitsu. All right,
back to the book. Now for real,

1036
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:08,100
those who are called skillful leaders
of old knew how to drive a wedge between

1037
01:05:08,101 --> 01:05:12,870
the enemy's front and rear to prevent
cooperation between his large and small

1038
01:05:12,871 --> 01:05:16,680
divisions to hinder the good
troops from rescuing the bad,

1039
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:18,130
the officer's from

1040
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:19,360
rallying their men.

1041
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:24,490
So when you are looking at your opponent,
what can you do to split them up?

1042
01:05:24,491 --> 01:05:28,210
What can you do to interfere with
what they're trying to make happen?

1043
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,860
That's a skill set in its own.

1044
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:32,830
So instead of worrying about
attacking you and mourn about,

1045
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:37,210
I'm focused on dispersing you or
splitting you up instead of worrying about

1046
01:05:37,211 --> 01:05:41,470
attacking you, I'm worried about
hindering people from helping you. Hmm.

1047
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:46,570
It's, it's a different way of thinking
about waging a battle. He said,

1048
01:05:46,571 --> 01:05:51,010
if thinking about the battle itself, what
other ways are there to go about this?

1049
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:53,140
Hmm.
More creatively.

1050
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:58,550
Rapidity is the essence of war.

1051
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:01,550
Take advantage of the
armies of the enemies.

1052
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:06,640
Unreadiness make your way by unexpected
routes and attack unguarded spots.

1053
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:13,163
Okay?

1054
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:15,520
Yeah. Here we go. Back to
the human side of things.

1055
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:20,260
Carefully study the wellbeing of
your men and do not overtax them.

1056
01:06:23,610 --> 01:06:26,460
Concentrate your energy
and hoard your strength.

1057
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:32,420
Keep your army continually on the move
and devise unfathomable pat plans.

1058
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:36,330
Now this is interesting.

1059
01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:41,520
Throw your soldiers into positions
whence there is no escape and they will

1060
01:06:41,521 --> 01:06:45,060
prefer to fight.
They will prefer death to flight.

1061
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:46,330
Okay?

1062
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:50,050
Officers and men alike,
we'll put forth their utmost strength

1063
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:55,390
at the critical moment.

1064
01:06:55,720 --> 01:07:00,190
The leader of an army acts like one who
has climbed up a height and then kicks

1065
01:07:00,191 --> 01:07:01,930
away the ladder behind him.

1066
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:03,220
Yeah.

1067
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:07,120
He carries his men deep into hostile
territory before he shows his hand.

1068
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:11,080
He burns his boats and
breaks his cooking pots.

1069
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:16,920
It's a second time we've heard
about those cooking pots,

1070
01:07:16,921 --> 01:07:20,640
obviously that depth and
that meant something back in
the day that meant it's on.

1071
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:23,810
We're not coming back. We're no,
no need for dinner tonight. Right.

1072
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:29,670
But that's an attitude to have. And
it's interesting, you know, this is,

1073
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,980
this is somewhat contradictory,

1074
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,610
some of what the other things that he
said in the book, you know, if, if the,

1075
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:38,580
if the enemy is strong,
fade away.

1076
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:42,060
And now he's saying put your soldiers
in a position where there's no escape.

1077
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,100
So that's contrary. But I, I, I
understand. I think I understand.

1078
01:07:47,101 --> 01:07:50,010
Or the way I translate that
is if you have to put your,

1079
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:54,150
if you have to accomplish something
very challenging and you have no choice,

1080
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:58,980
step into it, step into
it, kick away the ladder,

1081
01:07:59,790 --> 01:08:03,690
break your cooking pots and let the guys
know we're not coming back from this.

1082
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:07,710
We have what?
One choice and that's victory all in

1083
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:14,700
thus or sorry,
without waiting to be marshaled,

1084
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:18,620
the soldiers will be
constantly on the key VA.

1085
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:19,690
Yeah.

1086
01:08:19,690 --> 01:08:22,750
Key Viva, which means, uh, who goes,

1087
01:08:22,751 --> 01:08:26,560
which means on watch key
Viva without waiting.

1088
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:30,160
This is the important part.
Without waiting to be asked.

1089
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:33,310
They will do your will
without restriction.

1090
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:37,600
They will be faithful without
giving orders. They can be trusted.

1091
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:38,650
Okay,

1092
01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:43,650
so then you get the pure decentralized
command where we're without waiting to be

1093
01:08:46,421 --> 01:08:48,370
asked to do something,
they're going to do it.

1094
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:50,200
That's what you want your troopers to do.

1095
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:56,740
They will do. You will without
restrictions, they will be faithful.

1096
01:08:56,741 --> 01:08:58,510
You don't have to hold onto him.
You don't have to give him commands.

1097
01:08:58,511 --> 01:09:00,820
You don't have to give them orders.
They're going to be faithful to you.

1098
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:02,870
Okay.

1099
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:05,840
Without giving orders, they
can be trusted. That's true.

1100
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:08,300
Decentralized command
and that's what you want.

1101
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:11,713
Yeah.

1102
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:15,640
And then to wrap this one up,

1103
01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:23,970
unhappy is the fate of one who tries
to win his battles and succeed in his

1104
01:09:23,971 --> 01:09:28,920
attacks without cultivating
the spirit of enterprise.

1105
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:30,360
Okay.

1106
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:34,210
Meaning we want everyone to think,
hey,

1107
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:37,180
we want everybody be on the same page.

1108
01:09:39,490 --> 01:09:44,200
Move. Not unless you see an
advantage. Use Not your troops,

1109
01:09:44,201 --> 01:09:48,270
unless there is something to be gained.
Fight.

1110
01:09:48,271 --> 01:09:52,110
Not unless the position is critical.
Again,

1111
01:09:52,111 --> 01:09:54,690
that's contrary to what
what I just talked about.

1112
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:57,120
But I think the reason he said that
is because sometimes you have to,

1113
01:09:57,450 --> 01:10:01,080
sometimes you get into decisive situation.
You have to fight, you have to win.

1114
01:10:03,690 --> 01:10:08,690
No ruler should put troops into the
field merely to gratify his own spleen.

1115
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:11,330
Yeah.

1116
01:10:11,330 --> 01:10:13,290
And Spleen.
When he says that,

1117
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:18,620
that used to be where people thought
that the seat of emotion was so your

1118
01:10:21,001 --> 01:10:22,910
emotion came from your spleen.

1119
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:25,510
So He's saying what you've
been saying the whole night.

1120
01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:29,130
No rulership put troops in the field
merely to gratify his own emotions.

1121
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:33,240
And that emotion could be anything,
could be pride. It could be irritation,

1122
01:10:33,241 --> 01:10:34,074
beat anything.

1123
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:40,750
No general should fight a battle
simply out of peak. And that's,

1124
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:44,920
that's pride and ego.

1125
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:52,380
It is to your advantage to make a
forward move, make a forward move

1126
01:10:53,730 --> 01:10:54,563
if not,

1127
01:10:56,130 --> 01:10:57,480
stay where you are.

1128
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:00,650
Such

1129
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:03,710
is the art of war,

1130
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:12,180
obviously so much to be learned
from the past, from the ancients

1131
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:16,200
and also it's so accessible,

1132
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:20,040
but there's so many lessons to be learned.

1133
01:11:20,041 --> 01:11:25,041
Their lessons that if you learn their
mistakes that you don't have to make

1134
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:25,914
yourself.

1135
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:31,770
All you have to do
is open a book.

1136
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,110
Eight, open your mind and you'll be there.

1137
01:11:42,370 --> 01:11:46,300
And I think we get now go to questions
from the interwebs. Let's do it.

1138
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:50,140
But before that,

1139
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:51,613
mm.

1140
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:53,970
Internet stuff up,

1141
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:57,760
go to [inaudible] dot com slash
Jocko and why do you want to do that?

1142
01:11:58,630 --> 01:12:03,430
Get some good stuff. Yeah. Good sell
supplements, shroom tech. If you're,

1143
01:12:03,431 --> 01:12:06,660
um, if you're into high
intensity workouts for, you know,

1144
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:09,500
some prolonged period of time
gives you, gives you that, that,

1145
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:14,380
that boost in that sustenance
as far as output goes. Um,

1146
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:17,230
Alpha brain helps your mind work.

1147
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:22,420
That's the ones that I think we,
that I recommend and the warrior bar,

1148
01:12:22,450 --> 01:12:27,190
Do yourself that favor in life. And I
do the Krill oil, of course, Krill oil.

1149
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:28,960
I went to a meeting this week,

1150
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,590
they had a big old stack of
warrior bars when I went,

1151
01:12:33,430 --> 01:12:38,110
they were in the game,
my boy Zack was in the game down there.

1152
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:43,600
That'll surely enhance the meeting for
sure at warrior who did powered me up.

01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:03,100
Or get some shirts if you
like them, Jocko, store.com

1158
01:13:04,690 --> 01:13:07,340
or a mug coffee mug up before the enemy.
Both.

1159
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:11,320
First Question

1160
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:19,110
Jocko as an overthinker,
you missed some factors.

1161
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:23,700
Anxiety, low confidence, low Iq or Iq,

1162
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:28,030
perfectionism and often a
failure to prioritize. Yeah,

1163
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:31,050
so this is a question from
the last podcast, right?

1164
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:35,430
And this guy just sent me this tweet
and I thought it was a good assessment,

1165
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:40,290
right? Cause I'm not an overthinker
and maybe this guy is, and sorry,

1166
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:44,080
I don't have his Twitter call
sign there, but um, and he,

1167
01:13:44,081 --> 01:13:46,500
maybe he's an overthinker
so he kind of knew about it.

1168
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:50,160
If you don't remember the question,
you know someone that overthinks things,

1169
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:53,130
they get analysis paralysis,
right?

1170
01:13:53,131 --> 01:13:56,370
They just start thinking and thinking and
thinking they're frozen from their own

1171
01:13:56,371 --> 01:13:57,570
thoughts.
Too many thoughts.

1172
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:03,630
And so I thought these were good little
factors here. And it basically, to me,

1173
01:14:03,631 --> 01:14:08,631
it all boils down to actually fear
because if you're thinking then you're not

1174
01:14:09,571 --> 01:14:10,351
taking action.

1175
01:14:10,351 --> 01:14:12,790
And if you're not taking and there's
no consequences and if there's no

1176
01:14:12,791 --> 01:14:16,270
consequences and there's nothing
to be afraid of. So I think that

1177
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:22,580
the overthinking can be
an excuse for actual fear.

1178
01:14:22,610 --> 01:14:26,330
And same thing with like, oh, I'm a
perfectionist. That's also a fear.

1179
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:31,100
It's fear of not being perfect. And then
on top of that, low confidence, well,

1180
01:14:31,101 --> 01:14:35,630
if you have low confidence, guess what?
You're afraid your confidence is low,

1181
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,400
you're not sure yourself.

1182
01:14:37,401 --> 01:14:41,420
So you sit around and think about
doing it instead of actually doing it

1183
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:49,090
and then anxiety. Well, yeah,
anxiety actually is fear.

1184
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:54,790
You're afraid to do something.
And then Iq. Now that might be,

1185
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:59,470
I guess maybe someone has a High Iq
and therefore they're thinking a lot.

1186
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:03,790
And maybe that's not fear, but let me
ask you a question. If you're so smart,

1187
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:06,400
then why aren't you taking the
action and making something happen?

1188
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:09,640
So you've got a big Iq that's no excuse
to sit around and overthink things,

1189
01:15:10,270 --> 01:15:13,660
especially because if you're so smart,

1190
01:15:13,690 --> 01:15:16,480
why can't you come up with a quick
solution to why can't you realize that

1191
01:15:16,481 --> 01:15:19,480
overthinking is actually
causing the problem harm?

1192
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:20,920
It's not moving the problem forward.

1193
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:27,640
So quit thinking so much and take action.

1194
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:33,820
Next question. Okay. He's,

1195
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,410
he's talking about the Tim Ferris,

1196
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:39,030
the video with the extension
of your Tim Ferris. Yeah. Yeah.

1197
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:43,110
You're talking about martial
arts or martial arts. What
are the best martial art?

1198
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:46,420
If you haven't seen that
and you can look it up. Um,

1199
01:15:46,421 --> 01:15:51,421
so he says with respect to the above
mentioned video about your views on real

1200
01:15:52,571 --> 01:15:54,610
martial arts.
I have one quick question.

1201
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,850
You said that you came to your conclusion
based on a sparring match between

1202
01:15:57,851 --> 01:16:02,470
yourself in one of your fellow navy
seals with the match between yourself and

1203
01:16:02,471 --> 01:16:07,471
the traditional martial arts with 20 years
experience of friendly sparring match

1204
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:12,570
typical and training where he was pulling
his punches and strikes and strikes or

1205
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:15,790
was he attacking you with full force?
From my observation,

1206
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:19,210
Jujitsu guys collect some headshots
while going in for a takedown.

1207
01:16:19,630 --> 01:16:21,130
And if a traditional cut,

1208
01:16:21,131 --> 01:16:25,600
a tikka karate practitioner
doesn't hold back with this health,

1209
01:16:25,601 --> 01:16:27,730
some devastating effects in the long run.

1210
01:16:27,731 --> 01:16:30,040
Similar to what pro
football's players experience.

1211
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:34,720
I would love to get your take on this.
Someone who is real world experience.

1212
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:37,570
Okay.
So first of all,

1213
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,860
I didn't come to a conclusion
based on that one event.

1214
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:46,630
I mean that event influenced my
thoughts today, but even right now,

1215
01:16:46,631 --> 01:16:49,840
I don't have a conclusion.
Someone could show me something today.

1216
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:53,350
It's possible that I go, wow, that worked
really well. I never thought of that.

1217
01:16:53,351 --> 01:16:58,090
And that's new dot. Now trumps everything
else. It could happen. Not Likely though.

1218
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:02,710
Uh, my mind is still open, but that's
not like they have seen a lot now.

1219
01:17:02,711 --> 01:17:07,240
And that's particular scenario. He was
usually, he wasn't using a striking,

1220
01:17:07,241 --> 01:17:09,940
aren't a traditional striking her
and he was using the grappling aren't

1221
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:14,810
actually I kido and so he,
he was grappling with me.

1222
01:17:14,811 --> 01:17:16,220
He wasn't throwing punches at me,

1223
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:20,270
but it doesn't matter
because I have sparred and,

1224
01:17:20,271 --> 01:17:25,271
or fought with plenty of people over the
years that we're absolutely trying to

1225
01:17:25,971 --> 01:17:27,710
knock me out,
no doubt about it.

1226
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:32,600
And the fact of the matter
is it doesn't work. Um,

1227
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:38,510
even where this guy above
like for instance, this guy
and the question he says,

1228
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:43,430
if a traditional karate
practitioner doesn't hold back,

1229
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:46,910
it would have the same devastating
effect in the long run.

1230
01:17:46,911 --> 01:17:49,130
Similar to what pro
football players experience.

1231
01:17:50,330 --> 01:17:55,330
That statement actually defeats itself
because if you watch a football game,

1232
01:17:55,970 --> 01:18:00,680
those guys get hit in the head the
hundred times during a football game.

1233
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:04,940
And how often do they get actually
knocked unconscious? Not very often.

1234
01:18:04,941 --> 01:18:09,710
If you multiply whatever 10 players per
side that are actually banging heads

1235
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:14,300
times, however, and he plays,
you know, you're talking
about thousand Mo, you know,

1236
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:19,160
probably more than a thousand head on
head contacts and a football game and

1237
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:22,820
there might be one knockout in a game.
Sometimes there's no knockouts. Yeah,

1238
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:23,773
typically not.

1239
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:28,010
The fact of the matter is a hitting
someone in the head is not a guaranteed

1240
01:18:28,011 --> 01:18:30,920
knock out by any stretch of the
imagination. In fact, it rarely occurs.

1241
01:18:30,921 --> 01:18:35,750
It actually rarely curves in boxing
where two guys are trained to do that.

1242
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:41,920
So it's hard to knock somebody out and
it's the same thing if you watch UFC,

1243
01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:47,300
especially the early UFC. Yes. This was
proven over and over again that yeah,

1244
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:50,180
the dude grapplers going to
take some hits on the way in,

1245
01:18:51,230 --> 01:18:55,440
but they're going to get in and they're
going to take the person down and of,

1246
01:18:55,441 --> 01:18:58,910
of course, do you have a puncher's
chance? Of course you do.

1247
01:18:59,070 --> 01:19:02,710
There is this a very small chance that
when you shoot it on somebody they time

1248
01:19:02,711 --> 01:19:03,021
and knee,

1249
01:19:03,021 --> 01:19:06,440
are they time a punch and it happens to
hit you right in the spot that knocks

1250
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:09,140
you out? It does happen. It
happens in UFC occasionally.

1251
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:13,460
If you look at the number of take downs
to the number of knockouts that happened

1252
01:19:13,461 --> 01:19:17,660
while the take down is going on, it's
not a big number at all. Correct.

1253
01:19:17,690 --> 01:19:21,620
So you don't want to rely on that as
your formation of self defense at all.

1254
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:27,160
Now when things evolved eventually to
where the strikers were wrestlers to and

1255
01:19:27,561 --> 01:19:31,460
you got guys like chuck and you've got
Tito and you got Randy where it wasn't

1256
01:19:31,461 --> 01:19:33,680
their striking that was
preventing the takedown.

1257
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:35,660
It was because they
were bad ass wrestlers.

1258
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:37,220
That's what was stopping to take down.

1259
01:19:37,221 --> 01:19:40,380
It had nothing to do with
the way they punched. Yeah,

1260
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:46,210
so you really can't count on
striking to stop a grappler.

1261
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:51,740
That is not a good plan to say,
Hey,

1262
01:19:51,741 --> 01:19:54,560
I'm going to get so good at striking
that I'm going to stop a grappler that is

1263
01:19:54,561 --> 01:19:57,440
not a good pant plant.
Well you have to do is learn to grapple.

1264
01:19:57,620 --> 01:20:00,300
You have to learn to wrestle,
you have to learn Jujitsu. And,

1265
01:20:00,430 --> 01:20:05,210
and the opposite side of that is you
can't count on grappling to take down a

1266
01:20:05,211 --> 01:20:08,160
striker because you that
might know how to wrestle

1267
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,320
and therefore you need
to know how to strike.

1268
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,480
So it goes back to what
I say all the time.

1269
01:20:12,650 --> 01:20:15,300
You got to know how to graph and
governor not a strike. Right? Yeah.

1270
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,000
And if he's um,
he's talking,

1271
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:22,350
he says a traditional karate practitioner,
traditional.

1272
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:24,640
So,
and I'm assuming the,

1273
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:29,270
the only understanding of traditional
is he doesn't do karate and Jujitsu.

1274
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:31,780
He's not a mixed martial artist.
He just knows karate. So,

1275
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:37,770
yes. And I've taken crowded before
and there was no take down defense.

1276
01:20:37,771 --> 01:20:38,970
There was no takedowns,

1277
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:42,780
there was no functioning in
any capacity on the ground.

1278
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:48,030
And so
yeah,

1279
01:20:48,031 --> 01:20:51,420
and how you say like, okay,
over the longterm, okay,

1280
01:20:51,421 --> 01:20:56,421
you're going to have head trauma and
lasting damage if you take sustained head

1281
01:20:57,121 --> 01:20:59,550
trauma,
repetitive over the years,

1282
01:20:59,551 --> 01:21:03,390
really we're worried about the
next 42 seconds of the fight.

1283
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:04,260
That's about to happen,

1284
01:21:04,261 --> 01:21:07,530
not the next three decades of my life
where you can definitely break down.

1285
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:10,470
Cause I took some head trauma.
Exactly right. So you'd have to get,

1286
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:15,360
let's say that for the example of this
question that your experience with this

1287
01:21:15,361 --> 01:21:15,691
guy,

1288
01:21:15,691 --> 01:21:20,430
he was a karate guy and he was going
full speed and he didn't knock you out.

1289
01:21:20,431 --> 01:21:23,550
We'll just assume that he didn't
knock you up. You'd have to go.

1290
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:24,690
I'm just going to restate that.

1291
01:21:24,691 --> 01:21:29,670
That is a very safe assumption to assume
that the karate guy was not able to

1292
01:21:29,671 --> 01:21:34,030
knock me out, that I was able
to come in, you know, uh,

1293
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:38,280
a stand there. Good. Get it a good
distance. Faking with my hands,

1294
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:41,040
touch his face a couple of times.
He throws a big punch.

1295
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:45,000
I do a double leg take down,
he's on his back. It's game
over. Yeah. And by the way,

1296
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:48,630
go watch any youtube video of,
you know,

1297
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:52,950
Jujitsu versus whatever. Right. And
it's the same outcome every single time.

1298
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:56,310
You know, occasionally there'll be one
with a lot of hits because it's the,

1299
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:59,430
it's the chance knockout or the chance
or something else happened. Yeah.

1300
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:04,700
But 99% of the time it's double
leg take down slam on the ground.

1301
01:22:05,401 --> 01:22:08,840
Game over. Yeah. Sorry.
You can look at uh,

1302
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:13,750
who did Randy coach or a fight that
pro boxer Tony James Toney. Yeah,

1303
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:17,490
I mean it was, it was that exactly.
Here's you a a worldclass boxer.

1304
01:22:17,491 --> 01:22:21,720
A professional boxer. What did Randy
do? God inside took him down. Came over.

1305
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:25,110
Oh why didn't you knock them out?
Cause you can't, right. You can't just,

1306
01:22:25,111 --> 01:22:29,930
you can't just knock people out fully.
And that's not to mention,

1307
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:30,540
and I'm,

1308
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:34,380
I mean I'm going to mention it but that
it is not to mention that especially if

1309
01:22:34,381 --> 01:22:37,940
you,
if you practice the more self defense,

1310
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:40,560
like if it's heavily self
defense oriented Jujitsu,

1311
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:43,680
one of the first things you
learn is distance management.

1312
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:45,000
One of the first things you learn,

1313
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:48,990
it's like you almost can't
get past that element of it.

1314
01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:53,490
So you will take hits. Of course. Maybe
you will take it to the top of your head,

1315
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:54,760
shoulders or whatever.
But yes,

1316
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:59,040
significant strikes to anything to warrant
how it's stated here in the question.

1317
01:22:59,170 --> 01:23:02,160
Um, long term term damage
compared to football players.

1318
01:23:02,370 --> 01:23:06,220
You back to your situation,
you going with this guy,

1319
01:23:06,221 --> 01:23:07,330
let's say he did go full speed,

1320
01:23:07,810 --> 01:23:12,810
you would have to do probably 10 to 15
bouts of that every single day for a long

1321
01:23:14,231 --> 01:23:16,450
time for you to have any sustained damage.

1322
01:23:16,451 --> 01:23:20,460
And then so maybe if this guy is taking
the long term strategic view that you

1323
01:23:20,461 --> 01:23:24,670
should get to continuous bar me and hit
me in the head until I'm 50 years old

1324
01:23:24,690 --> 01:23:28,370
navy elistic disease.
And maybe I'm saying maybe so.

1325
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:32,260
Cause if he's a traditional guy, he
doesn't know how to manage the takedown.

1326
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:36,400
So knowing how to manage the takedown
makes your strikes more effective.

1327
01:23:36,401 --> 01:23:38,650
You don't have that.
Your strikes are not effective.

1328
01:23:38,651 --> 01:23:42,680
So can you take one hit let's say,
let's say you take five hits, right?

1329
01:23:44,050 --> 01:23:46,750
You controlling the fight
as much as Jujitsu does,

1330
01:23:46,810 --> 01:23:50,380
even if you're not that high level versus
the guy who doesn't know Jujitsu way

1331
01:23:50,381 --> 01:23:55,150
outweighs this grossly to the point
that these things are aside from the

1332
01:23:55,151 --> 01:24:00,151
puncher's chance in effective and I think
UFC one two three you know as before

1333
01:24:01,691 --> 01:24:03,970
people start to get hip to
the whole Jujitsu thing,

1334
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,530
but before people knew Jujitsu,

1335
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:08,050
they just knew there are other
stuff that was the testing ground.

1336
01:24:08,051 --> 01:24:10,680
That was the whole reason you'll
see was invented by the way on.

1337
01:24:10,690 --> 01:24:13,220
That's why those first few
of are awesome. Yeah, you,

1338
01:24:13,221 --> 01:24:18,221
you get to see these 250 and no
bare knuckle kick boxer guys strong,

1339
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:18,971
you know,

1340
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:23,050
go in there with real quote unquote
real fighting experience against the way

1341
01:24:23,070 --> 01:24:27,280
smaller grappler Jujitsu
guy and lose and it's act.

1342
01:24:29,050 --> 01:24:33,410
This is to go one step further. If you
watch UFC too. Pat Smith, who's I want,

1343
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:36,090
he was one of my favorite guys by the way
when I was watching. It's a kickboxer.

1344
01:24:36,091 --> 01:24:39,520
He's bad ass guy to 10 solid racking guys,

1345
01:24:39,521 --> 01:24:43,120
makes it to the finals against hoists.
Gracie and hoists.

1346
01:24:43,121 --> 01:24:46,210
Gracie didn't tap him out or he tapped
them out. But now with a submission hold,

1347
01:24:46,211 --> 01:24:47,530
he tapped him due to strikes.

1348
01:24:47,990 --> 01:24:52,480
So grappler pounded out a striker guy.

1349
01:24:52,610 --> 01:24:56,170
I'm not submissions. It was
all punches. It was nowadays,

1350
01:24:56,171 --> 01:24:57,790
no one would ever talk to that now.

1351
01:24:57,820 --> 01:25:01,030
But I'm just saying only because
they know if you don't know,

1352
01:25:01,230 --> 01:25:04,750
you just think your dad. Yeah.
Yeah. One guy, like I said before,

1353
01:25:04,751 --> 01:25:08,860
long I tapped because he was
claustrophobic. He just got
mounted. But nonetheless,

1354
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:11,640
um, yeah, it's,

1355
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:15,730
it's hard to really reconcile
really what this question,

1356
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,070
I don't know if it's implying anything.
Well,

1357
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:21,490
it's definitely implying that this guy
that I was going against was like holding

1358
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:24,460
back. Right. And that might, uh, you
know, pull the different tale if,

1359
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:28,540
but I've been against countless,

1360
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:32,110
literally countless of guys have
sparred against me trying to talk me out

1361
01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:35,770
whether they're traditional
martial artists, whether
they're just countless guys.

1362
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:40,570
Yeah. And it's hard to knock somebody
out. Yeah. And I dunno, I don't know who,

1363
01:25:40,571 --> 01:25:41,890
that's the question.
Of course,

1364
01:25:41,891 --> 01:25:44,470
I'm not going to hate on the
question or nothing like that.

1365
01:25:45,310 --> 01:25:46,570
But speaking from experience,

1366
01:25:46,571 --> 01:25:50,590
this sounds like the exact question that
inexperienced people have. You know,

1367
01:25:50,591 --> 01:25:51,760
people who are,
no,

1368
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:54,820
this is coming most likely from
something that's been heavily involved in

1369
01:25:54,821 --> 01:25:58,060
traditional martial arts
and has been told that, hey,

1370
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:00,880
don't worry about somebody trying to
take you down because if you just hit him

1371
01:26:00,881 --> 01:26:03,920
here and here or they'll fall and you'll
win. That's what I'm talking about.

1372
01:26:03,921 --> 01:26:04,010
That's

1373
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:06,350
not, that's not good. That's sort of
why I put this in here. And you know,

1374
01:26:06,351 --> 01:26:11,150
just to make sure that, um, that
they realize that hey, you shouldn't,

1375
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:14,930
you should actually pay attention to what
else is going on in the world instead

1376
01:26:14,931 --> 01:26:17,900
of staying in like, Hey, just this
one little traditional martial art.

1377
01:26:18,350 --> 01:26:21,410
And it's the same thing with, if you're
just doing Jujitsu and we're going to,

1378
01:26:21,411 --> 01:26:24,620
I got this in here and later, there's
another question about this, but I mean,

1379
01:26:24,710 --> 01:26:29,240
I don't tell people just trained Jujitsu.
I tell him, train, Jujitsu, change,

1380
01:26:29,241 --> 01:26:32,480
wrestling, trained boxing chain,
Moy, Tai, and you know what?

1381
01:26:32,481 --> 01:26:35,120
When you get done with all that and you
have a good base train Krav Maga and

1382
01:26:35,121 --> 01:26:37,370
then you, you know what do
realistic situation, by the way,

1383
01:26:37,371 --> 01:26:39,680
you should learn how to shoot a gun and
by the way, you should be in good shape.

1384
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:43,790
Do everything. Yeah. Yeah. Agreed.

1385
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:46,640
The answer is not the answer.
Yeah.

1386
01:26:48,590 --> 01:26:49,423
Okay.

1387
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:50,333
T shirt.

1388
01:26:53,980 --> 01:26:58,630
Every time we say something like that,
like one answer is not the answer,

1389
01:26:58,690 --> 01:27:02,140
which I must admit, it sounds pretty
cool. Pretty Dope. But we'll get,

1390
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:05,550
everyone's going to say, put
that on a tee shirt. Hey,

1391
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:08,780
then I have to refer to echo to see if
he's going to put it on a tee shirt. Yup.

1392
01:27:09,010 --> 01:27:11,770
We'll see how that works out.
All right. Next question.

1393
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:17,220
Is it better to reveal too much
information or too little information?

1394
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:22,510
Both in personal life and leadership.
Okay,

1395
01:27:22,511 --> 01:27:25,450
so there's two sides to this,

1396
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:29,920
not just the personal and
the business side, but in,

1397
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:34,210
in the business side, there's two pieces
really. There's operational and planning,

1398
01:27:34,211 --> 01:27:36,550
right? So if you've got something
that you're planning for,

1399
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:40,320
whether you're a company and you're
trying to plan a new strategy for the next

1400
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:40,330
quarter,

1401
01:27:40,330 --> 01:27:44,100
the next year or the next company that
you're going to open or the Newco,

1402
01:27:44,190 --> 01:27:47,470
whatever you're going to do,
there's that and you're planning that.

1403
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:51,430
Then I want to, and and in the military,
if you're planning an operation,

1404
01:27:51,431 --> 01:27:53,770
you're putting together a mission
that you're going to go do.

1405
01:27:53,830 --> 01:27:56,890
In both those situations, I give
everyone all the information that I have.

1406
01:27:56,891 --> 01:27:58,510
Absolutely.
I don't.

1407
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:01,990
I let them know everything that I
know so that they can away everything.

1408
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,810
As much as I wait. In fact,
I want them to toil with the,

1409
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:09,990
with the information more than I do so
that I can kind of get a fresher look at

1410
01:28:10,121 --> 01:28:12,250
it when I come in.
So I,

1411
01:28:12,270 --> 01:28:16,990
and I think I do and I did see people
that would hold back information in those

1412
01:28:16,991 --> 01:28:20,980
situations. Leaders that would hold back
information. Why would they do that?

1413
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:26,160
Because they're insecure because
knowledge gives you power and you use that

1414
01:28:26,441 --> 01:28:30,010
knowledge to say you come in and echoes,
got a good plan put together. And I go,

1415
01:28:30,011 --> 01:28:32,980
yeah, but you got to think about this
right here. And you just say, well,

1416
01:28:32,981 --> 01:28:36,670
I didn't know that,
but it gives me a little bit of leverage.

1417
01:28:36,671 --> 01:28:38,890
It gives me a little bit of power.
That's ridiculous.

1418
01:28:38,891 --> 01:28:43,891
So when it comes to planning
and operations and conducting
business and planning

1419
01:28:43,961 --> 01:28:48,220
missions, man, share all the information
you've got in your organization,

1420
01:28:48,221 --> 01:28:51,520
out of the organization.
So everybody has the knowledge.

1421
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,190
That's answer number one.

1422
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:59,700
Then we get to the information
regarding the leadership of humans.

1423
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:01,893
Yeah.

1424
01:29:02,510 --> 01:29:06,450
And of course you hear
words like transparency and
we gotta be honest and you

1425
01:29:06,451 --> 01:29:08,210
can hear those things
getting thrown around and,

1426
01:29:08,270 --> 01:29:10,640
and of course no one's going
to argue with them, right?

1427
01:29:10,670 --> 01:29:13,490
No one's going to argue and say,
hey, you shouldn't be honest.

1428
01:29:14,510 --> 01:29:17,030
No one's going to say you
shouldn't be transparent. Right.

1429
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:23,570
But the fact of the matter is you cannot
always share all the information all

1430
01:29:23,571 --> 01:29:26,360
the time when it comes to leading people.
You can't do it.

1431
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:28,290
Okay.

1432
01:29:28,290 --> 01:29:31,770
And here's the problem of why you can't
do it because people can't always handle

1433
01:29:31,771 --> 01:29:32,850
the truth.
Hmm.

1434
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:34,340
Yeah.

1435
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:39,110
And when you give them the truth, they
might have a bunch of different reactions.

1436
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:43,010
Right? Some of those reactions being anger
and defensiveness. So in other words,

1437
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:44,750
if I tell someone,
hey,

1438
01:29:44,751 --> 01:29:48,410
I'm putting this other person in charge
cause I don't think you're smart enough

1439
01:29:48,411 --> 01:29:52,100
to figure out the solution.
Yeah, that's my true statement.

1440
01:29:52,190 --> 01:29:56,630
I'm going to be honest with you. I don't
think you're smart. What does that do?

1441
01:29:57,230 --> 01:30:01,520
How does that affect the mission? Does
it move us closer to the goal? Are you,

1442
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:05,030
is that person now going to be really
supportive of me and work hard knowing

1443
01:30:05,031 --> 01:30:09,350
that I think they're stupid.
The answers, of course not.

1444
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:11,210
Okay.

1445
01:30:11,210 --> 01:30:15,650
I mean another example is what if you
think that your boss is planned is

1446
01:30:15,651 --> 01:30:20,630
terrible. And so you go in there and
say, Hey, your boss is terrible. Your,

1447
01:30:20,631 --> 01:30:23,810
your plan that you came up with is awful.
Now,

1448
01:30:23,811 --> 01:30:26,900
there might be some bosses that are secure
and their leadership and their secure

1449
01:30:26,901 --> 01:30:30,320
with it and they go, aw man, why do you
think that here? Break it down for me.

1450
01:30:30,620 --> 01:30:33,500
That's cool. But a lot of bosses
are going to be insulted by that.

1451
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:37,040
A lot of bosses, you're going to hurt
their ego and instead of listening to the,

1452
01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:41,510
to the idea that you have,
instead they're going to be angered by it.

1453
01:30:42,950 --> 01:30:44,530
They are going to turn it off,
they're going to turn off,

1454
01:30:44,531 --> 01:30:45,790
their minds are going to be mad at you.

1455
01:30:45,910 --> 01:30:47,560
They're not going to
listen to you anymore.

1456
01:30:47,561 --> 01:30:51,460
Cause the way you came across so
you would have been better off.

1457
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:52,790
Okay.

1458
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:57,500
Not being quote unquote honest and
not sharing all the information,

1459
01:30:57,620 --> 01:31:02,270
you would have been better off slowly
trying to take the plan that he came up

1460
01:31:02,271 --> 01:31:05,200
with and maybe maneuver on
it or maybe say, hey boss,

1461
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:07,160
I don't know if that's gonna work
because of this thing over here.

1462
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:09,020
But you be tactful

1463
01:31:11,510 --> 01:31:14,180
and there's a million examples
we could talk of like that.

1464
01:31:14,630 --> 01:31:18,860
And so when it comes to leading people,
not operations,

1465
01:31:18,861 --> 01:31:22,220
not planning missions, when it comes
to leading people, you need to think,

1466
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:27,680
think about what you're saying, thinking
of how it's going to impact the team.

1467
01:31:27,681 --> 01:31:32,000
Think about how it's gonna impact the
relationships up and down the chain of

1468
01:31:32,001 --> 01:31:34,340
command. Think about how it's
going to impact the mission.

1469
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:37,730
Because if you're a good leader,
anywhere on that,

1470
01:31:38,330 --> 01:31:39,910
anywhere in that chain of command,
if you're a good leader,

1471
01:31:39,930 --> 01:31:41,810
the most important thing you
should be achieving the mission.

1472
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:47,320
So if your honesty is actually creating
adversarial relationships inside your

1473
01:31:48,231 --> 01:31:50,780
team, what good are you doing
moving the mission forward?

1474
01:31:50,810 --> 01:31:52,210
The answer is you're not.
Hmm.

1475
01:31:53,870 --> 01:31:54,410
Okay.

1476
01:31:54,410 --> 01:31:57,620
So I'm not telling you to be dishonest,

1477
01:31:58,550 --> 01:32:00,130
but I'm you to think,

1478
01:32:02,370 --> 01:32:06,670
and it's the same thing
in your personal life.

1479
01:32:06,970 --> 01:32:09,070
You got to think about what you're saying.

1480
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:13,720
You got to think about your wife's
perspective or your husbands perspective,

1481
01:32:13,721 --> 01:32:16,510
where your kid's perspective
or your friend's perspective.

1482
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:18,240
Yeah,

1483
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:22,380
how is what I'm about to say
going to affect them long term.

1484
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:28,810
You gotta be measured. Now you might
give them a little hint of something

1485
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:31,860
and then see how they react.

1486
01:32:31,861 --> 01:32:33,900
And maybe you could be a little
bit more honest with them.

1487
01:32:34,710 --> 01:32:37,830
Maybe you could throw some bait out
there and see if they bite on it,

1488
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:44,420
but you just don't want to jump in or
throw it out to where now you've created

1489
01:32:47,071 --> 01:32:51,990
an adversarial relationship with your
friend, with your spouse, with your kids,

1490
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:57,430
because now they're not listening to
it's even with your kids or you got to be

1491
01:32:57,431 --> 01:33:00,880
totally honest with your kids. Okay.
You know what? Totally. Honestly,

1492
01:33:01,270 --> 01:33:05,860
I don't think you're capable of being
this level of an athlete. Right?

1493
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:10,050
Do they need to hear that when they're
nine years old? Probably not. Mm hmm.

1494
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:19,030
So you just gotta think you gotta think,

1495
01:33:19,031 --> 01:33:24,031
and there's a ways to get that
information across in a tactical way,

1496
01:33:24,430 --> 01:33:28,810
in an indirect way so that it's
still manages to improve the person.

1497
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:32,230
Because I don't want to have echo come up.

1498
01:33:32,231 --> 01:33:35,800
Will you come up with a bunch of
bad ideas? And all I do is say, oh,

1499
01:33:35,801 --> 01:33:37,900
that's a good idea. That's a good
idea. That's good. I didn't train you,

1500
01:33:37,901 --> 01:33:40,990
I didn't improve you. I want to say,
hey, you know what, that's not bad.

1501
01:33:40,991 --> 01:33:44,110
What if we did this? You know what I mean?
And so we move in the right direction.

1502
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:48,610
We still have some mentorship going on,
but it's indirect.

1503
01:33:48,611 --> 01:33:51,130
We still have some coaching going on,

1504
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:55,150
but it's indirect because I don't want
to coach you and you don't want to be

1505
01:33:55,151 --> 01:33:56,140
coached by me.

1506
01:33:58,090 --> 01:34:02,410
Even my son when I like tell
him something in Jujitsu,

1507
01:34:02,590 --> 01:34:06,640
I've been doing Jujitsu for over 20
years with some of the best guys in the

1508
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:10,300
entire world literally. And I'll say, hey,

1509
01:34:10,301 --> 01:34:12,430
thought you need to scoot your hip a
little bit more when you do that move.

1510
01:34:12,670 --> 01:34:13,720
And he'd go, no, you don't

1511
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:20,920
really know actually you do it. What
he'll listen to Jeff. Hey listen to dean.

1512
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:23,780
Actually you won't actually, I've heard
him argue with both Jeff and dean.

1513
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,220
He's navy with their approach.
Yeah.

1514
01:34:27,221 --> 01:34:29,650
Maybe they can give you a little more
indirect. Correct, Doug Man. Yup.

1515
01:34:30,250 --> 01:34:34,780
And that kind of illustrates one
of the many challenges with that.

1516
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:38,530
Um, you know, one of the simple but not
easy things because everyone's different.

1517
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,750
How you saying throw something out
there and see how they respond.

1518
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:43,030
Everyone's going to respond different.
That's the thing.

1519
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:46,960
So it is kind of this feeling out
process. It's, you know, I think that,

1520
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:49,510
and I mentioned this before where,
you know,

1521
01:34:49,511 --> 01:34:53,700
some people they'll be direct but people
don't really like him and then they,

1522
01:34:53,730 --> 01:34:58,070
they dealt kind of doubled down on it and
say, Hey, you know, I, I speak the truth,

1523
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:02,510
you know, and like me for who I am or
whatever. So what you do when you do that,

1524
01:35:02,511 --> 01:35:06,160
when people do that is the
render themselves ineffective in,

1525
01:35:06,290 --> 01:35:09,890
in situations now, no one's leadership.
Exactly right. And guess what?

1526
01:35:09,891 --> 01:35:12,650
No one's who might each of their party,
no one wants to be your friend. You know,

1527
01:35:12,651 --> 01:35:16,220
you may or may not have gotten a divorce
from it and it's all because you check,

1528
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:18,140
essentially you just chose to be a dick.

1529
01:35:18,890 --> 01:35:23,890
We all understand that certain things
are insulting if you're quote unquote to

1530
01:35:25,211 --> 01:35:28,090
on, you know everyone except
you, you know, you're the,

1531
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:32,730
if you look around and no one wants to
be around you, that's a problem. Yeah.

1532
01:35:33,070 --> 01:35:36,930
Newsflash, you're a jerk. Yes. And inch.

1533
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:40,760
And people don't follow jerks.
They really don't. Yeah. Yeah.

1534
01:35:40,761 --> 01:35:45,630
So it's not an isn't it? Honesty is never
an excuse to be a jerk to people. Yeah.

1535
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:47,750
And don't mistake,

1536
01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:52,790
you know how people have this kind of
misconception that speaking your mind is a

1537
01:35:52,791 --> 01:35:57,300
good thing. It's not black and white.
You're totally right. Don't be like, Hey,

1538
01:35:57,301 --> 01:36:00,100
I know that's what's so
crazy about this is like, um,

1539
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:04,880
people I think always have that feeling.
I mean,

1540
01:36:04,881 --> 01:36:08,210
I said it when I was talking, you know,
people say, oh, of course, honesty is,

1541
01:36:08,290 --> 01:36:11,540
you know, the best thing and you gotta
be honest. And I would say that I am,

1542
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:16,880
I am known as a person that is
honest and a straight shooter

1543
01:36:18,590 --> 01:36:22,910
and that's great.
But at the same time,

1544
01:36:22,970 --> 01:36:27,200
like you just said, that doesn't
mean I run around. It insults people.

1545
01:36:27,650 --> 01:36:32,290
It means I'm a tactician. You know
what, it's not honesty. It's tat.

1546
01:36:32,291 --> 01:36:36,530
It's being a tactician because w this is
something that can actually go too far

1547
01:36:36,531 --> 01:36:38,540
as well. Um, if,

1548
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:44,060
if you're constantly always telling
him everyone thing every year,

1549
01:36:44,061 --> 01:36:47,930
all sugarcoated. Well now the no one
respects your opinion either, right?

1550
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:50,000
You just hear him saying, you
know, if I just say, oh, Echo,

1551
01:36:50,001 --> 01:36:53,510
you did a great job with that video.
You did a great job with that video too.

1552
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:56,360
You did great. Well, what if you
were producing junk video, sad exam?

1553
01:36:56,390 --> 01:36:59,630
I need to tell you. Yeah, I
know. It's a rough example. Uh,

1554
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:03,380
I would need to think of something that
you didn't do such high quality point

1555
01:37:03,381 --> 01:37:04,100
take. No, for sure.

1556
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:07,850
I've gotta I've gotta be honest with
you and if all I do is tell you, hey,

1557
01:37:07,851 --> 01:37:10,760
it's great, it's great, it's great, it's
great, it's great, it's great. You know,

1558
01:37:10,761 --> 01:37:14,060
that doesn't help us. What I need to say
is, hey man, that's an awesome video.

1559
01:37:14,150 --> 01:37:16,860
It'd be cool if you captured
this angle too, right?

1560
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:21,560
Or do you think it'd be possible to get
this message across also and you'd say,

1561
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:24,460
Oh, I can do anything. You
see how I just played Eureka?

1562
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:28,180
Then you see what I did that,
yeah. Hey. Yeah, like I'll,

1563
01:37:28,190 --> 01:37:30,960
do you think it's even possible to get
this angle in there and you'd be like,

1564
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:33,470
Oh yeah, I could make it
come across strong. Dang.

1565
01:37:33,471 --> 01:37:35,970
I didn't even know there was a fight.
He didn't just what?

1566
01:37:36,050 --> 01:37:39,080
I just had a little victory
up in here. All right. Yeah,

1567
01:37:39,081 --> 01:37:42,920
so it's not black and white or like
like everything. It's a balance.

1568
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:47,980
It's all balanced sense of dichotomy
psychotomy between telling the truth and

1569
01:37:49,130 --> 01:37:53,790
being tactful.
Next question,

1570
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:56,220
Jocko.
How do you handle

1571
01:37:56,220 --> 01:38:00,210
it? When someone up the chain
of command betrays trust,

1572
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:04,650
like what is this like lying? They lied
to you or this could be, this is a huge,

1573
01:38:04,651 --> 01:38:09,480
this is a huge spectrum of,
I guess for number one you just learned,

1574
01:38:10,710 --> 01:38:13,740
you just learned something
about someone's character. Yeah.

1575
01:38:13,741 --> 01:38:16,860
You now kind of know better
what you're dealing with. Now,

1576
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:19,800
if this is a major situation,

1577
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,260
you might have to immediately confronted
and or go above them and the chain of

1578
01:38:25,261 --> 01:38:26,760
command, I mean, if there's lives at risk,

1579
01:38:27,330 --> 01:38:30,060
if there's something morally
wrong that is happening,

1580
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:33,990
if there's something illegal that's
happening that now you're going to get

1581
01:38:33,991 --> 01:38:36,720
wrapped into, and that's another
decision you got to make.

1582
01:38:36,740 --> 01:38:37,800
If you're not going to be wrapped into it,

1583
01:38:37,801 --> 01:38:40,110
then it's a decision you've got to make.
If you want to ruin this person's life,

1584
01:38:40,390 --> 01:38:43,080
whatever, that's that's a different
decision. That's not this question.

1585
01:38:43,081 --> 01:38:45,630
We'd have to deal with that
in a separate question. Mm.

1586
01:38:46,830 --> 01:38:51,750
Are innocent people being hurt? So if, if
it's something like that, lives at risk,

1587
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:55,500
you know, something morally wrong is
happening, something illegal is happening,

1588
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:57,390
innocent people being hurt,

1589
01:38:57,750 --> 01:39:00,420
then you're probably going to have to
say something or you're going to have to

1590
01:39:00,421 --> 01:39:04,950
say something. Now, I will tell
you this before you say something,

1591
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:09,510
make sure all your ducks in a
row made sure you have evidence.

1592
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:13,020
Don't go off half cocked.
Be Ready.

1593
01:39:13,590 --> 01:39:17,910
Because people that are deceitful
like this, they, they, they prepare,

1594
01:39:18,510 --> 01:39:23,510
they are ready for battle
to protect themselves and
they don't care what happens

1595
01:39:23,581 --> 01:39:26,430
to other people.
So you've got to watch out for that.

1596
01:39:26,431 --> 01:39:30,270
Now if it's something really, if
it's something minor, you know,

1597
01:39:30,271 --> 01:39:32,760
if it's something minor,
then

1598
01:39:33,810 --> 01:39:34,080
okay,

1599
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:37,080
that's something that you logged
down and in the brain, right?

1600
01:39:37,330 --> 01:39:40,410
Something that you logged
down in the brain and

1601
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:42,083
MMM.

1602
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:48,980
But it allows you to see person's
character. And that means, again,

1603
01:39:49,130 --> 01:39:50,720
it's a minor infraction,

1604
01:39:50,750 --> 01:39:53,690
but it also means you got
to watch yourself and you
got to watch them a little

1605
01:39:53,691 --> 01:39:58,550
bit more closely. You gotta be
careful because people like that,

1606
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:02,310
they think they're smarter
than everyone else.

1607
01:40:02,570 --> 01:40:04,450
They think that they're
getting away with why.

1608
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:08,770
So they think they're smarter
than, there's like a little
hint of sociopath. Yeah.

1609
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:12,540
In there that they can
get away with these lies.

1610
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:16,140
And so you got to watch him.
You got to watch him.

1611
01:40:17,860 --> 01:40:18,240
Okay.

1612
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:22,740
Carefully in, in, like I said, it kind
of goes back to that previous question

1613
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:29,300
because you don't want to be a person
that comes across as dishonest yourself.

1614
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:33,570
And if people don't think they
can trust what you're saying,

1615
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:37,110
they're not going to trust you
with other things. So if you know,

1616
01:40:37,111 --> 01:40:40,830
I'm not giving you good
feedback because I'm too nice,

1617
01:40:41,850 --> 01:40:45,000
you're not going to start you, you're
not going to respect my opinion anymore.

1618
01:40:45,090 --> 01:40:49,470
Right. So you know, when you're,

1619
01:40:49,471 --> 01:40:52,020
when you're dealing with someone, if
someone comes to you instead of getting,

1620
01:40:52,021 --> 01:40:55,540
this is honesty versus if
you come to me and say, Hey,

1621
01:40:55,541 --> 01:40:59,430
what do you think of this plant?
I'm not going to say, Hey,

1622
01:40:59,431 --> 01:41:00,450
I think that's a stupid plan.

1623
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:02,120
Okay.

1624
01:41:02,120 --> 01:41:05,870
I might say, I don't know if that's how I
do it. I might try this approach. Right?

1625
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:10,370
You're just going to be diplomatic. If
you, if I'm not going to say to you,

1626
01:41:10,371 --> 01:41:12,320
I don't think you're smart
enough to figure this out.

1627
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:16,740
I have moved you to a different division
cause I don't think you're smart enough

1628
01:41:16,741 --> 01:41:19,980
to solve this problem. I'm not going to
say that. I'm going to say, you know what?

1629
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,830
I need you on this other project over
here that I think you're going to be

1630
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:24,930
really knock this thing out of the park.

1631
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:26,013
Hmm.

1632
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:29,720
Now you're getting to know deep inside.

1633
01:41:31,700 --> 01:41:32,533
Okay.

1634
01:41:32,670 --> 01:41:35,850
But it's called tact and
that's what you have to use.

1635
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:41,550
But back to the honesty or when person
betrays your trust, you've learned,

1636
01:41:41,580 --> 01:41:44,100
you've learned about their character.
If it's a big thing,

1637
01:41:44,310 --> 01:41:46,950
you're going to have to talk about it.
You're gonna have to tell somebody. Yeah.

1638
01:41:48,930 --> 01:41:49,890
It's a little thing.

1639
01:41:51,510 --> 01:41:56,490
You got to watch TV. I think we just
learned that vocabulary tonight.

1640
01:41:56,790 --> 01:41:58,650
Who's their watch?

1641
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:03,620
Hmm. Yeah. The, you know how you
see and you log it in your brain,

1642
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:07,190
right? Logging in your brain that, okay,
they lied about that. Or Oh, I, you know,

1643
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:11,600
I think you should constantly do that.
Right. And I think we all do that anyway.

1644
01:42:11,601 --> 01:42:16,040
That that's really, I think that's
why. And your brain has certain ways,

1645
01:42:16,270 --> 01:42:19,130
um, just the way it's wired,
like first impressions, right.

1646
01:42:19,330 --> 01:42:20,570
That's usually a big thing.

1647
01:42:21,350 --> 01:42:26,350
But really what's really going on isn't
that the first impression is this has

1648
01:42:27,171 --> 01:42:29,780
more weight specifically.
Then you know,

1649
01:42:29,870 --> 01:42:32,090
other other impressions
that you get along the line.

1650
01:42:32,150 --> 01:42:35,660
It's because let's say you don't, let's
say, I don't know that much about you.

1651
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:38,270
I don't know really. This is the first
time I ever met you heard about you,

1652
01:42:38,271 --> 01:42:42,080
whatever your first impression. It's
not that it's so heavy, it's just,

1653
01:42:42,110 --> 01:42:45,680
it's the only impression. So it seems
like everything. If you're a dick to me,

1654
01:42:45,710 --> 01:42:50,000
okay, you're a dick in my mind you're
just a dick. Second Day you're not a Dick,

1655
01:42:50,270 --> 01:42:54,500
you're 50% Dick, which is,
that's still a day, you know?

1656
01:42:54,501 --> 01:42:57,290
Even if you're 20% Dick, you're like,
okay, I like them buddies still the day,

1657
01:42:57,320 --> 01:43:02,090
you know. So again, my point is you're
always logging stuff in your brain.

1658
01:43:02,091 --> 01:43:02,811
What does this person,

1659
01:43:02,811 --> 01:43:06,410
what does this person not when it comes
to someone who betrayed your trust,

1660
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:10,790
this doesn't really count them
out as far as trusting them.

1661
01:43:11,090 --> 01:43:13,130
Cause a lot of times the more
time you spend with them,

1662
01:43:13,131 --> 01:43:16,880
the more experience you have with them,
you start to get a picture of, okay,

1663
01:43:16,881 --> 01:43:20,420
he'll be trained. My trust, in this
case, in this type of situation,

1664
01:43:20,540 --> 01:43:24,890
it's like if you have a friend who he
would literally risk his life to save your

1665
01:43:24,891 --> 01:43:29,120
life, but at the same time
he would probably hook up
with your wife if he had the

1666
01:43:29,121 --> 01:43:31,310
opportunity, you know? So there's
different kinds of things.

1667
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:34,640
So as you gain experience with people,

1668
01:43:35,180 --> 01:43:39,260
therefore risking his own
life, right? Sure. Of course.

1669
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:42,320
But you start to get a
picture of who the person,

1670
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:45,320
and I don't have any friends like that.
Yeah.

1671
01:43:46,490 --> 01:43:47,720
But I do know what you're saying.

1672
01:43:47,870 --> 01:43:51,950
There's people that have different
moral compass and moral and so

1673
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:54,590
you're judging them based
on that, right? Yeah.

1674
01:43:54,591 --> 01:43:58,680
So just be careful not to judge him
based on that. So again, based on,

1675
01:43:59,170 --> 01:44:01,670
we'll see, but that's part
of like this big picture. So,

1676
01:44:01,730 --> 01:44:03,680
cause ultimately you
want to get to the point,

1677
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:08,900
and I've had this experience specifically
in my life before where, you know,

1678
01:44:08,950 --> 01:44:12,170
you want to get to the point
where you trust them. Yeah.

1679
01:44:12,171 --> 01:44:15,920
I trust them to be that person. You know?
I know he's not trustworthy in this,

1680
01:44:15,921 --> 01:44:17,630
but he's just wear this. So I, yeah,

1681
01:44:18,110 --> 01:44:20,480
his role in my life or in
this company or whatever.

1682
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:25,460
I know I trust him to be him, that
therefore I won't give them this task.

1683
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:27,890
You trust that he's going to
have them. Yes, exactly. Right.

1684
01:44:28,060 --> 01:44:31,610
I host the Scorpion to be the Scorpion
stings the frog to be the frog. Yes.

1685
01:44:31,611 --> 01:44:34,910
And that comes with like the experience.
So if someone, you know, like you said,

1686
01:44:34,911 --> 01:44:35,990
if it's a minor thing,

1687
01:44:36,110 --> 01:44:39,500
don't go jumped down his throat or just
jump to this thing. Really just be like,

1688
01:44:39,501 --> 01:44:42,050
okay, you know, deal with it
in your way. But like I said,

1689
01:44:42,051 --> 01:44:46,790
log in in your brain and move forward
what you know and keep your eyes open to

1690
01:44:46,791 --> 01:44:49,430
things that you can trust them above
so you can get that full picture.

1691
01:44:49,431 --> 01:44:51,050
And I hate to say this
and I've said it before,

1692
01:44:51,051 --> 01:44:54,630
I don't have these massively high
expectations of other human beings. Yeah.

1693
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:55,790
I hate to say it,

1694
01:44:56,240 --> 01:45:00,740
but I'm kind of anticipating that
they're telling me half truths. Yeah.

1695
01:45:01,130 --> 01:45:02,900
And Yeah.
Yeah.

1696
01:45:02,910 --> 01:45:07,130
So don't get these high expectations and
expect that people are going to try and

1697
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:09,180
get one over on you.
Yeah.

1698
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:12,980
And then when you do get your core of
people that you know are really truly

1699
01:45:12,981 --> 01:45:16,790
trustworthy, that's awesome. Yeah. That
might be three people in your life. Yeah.

1700
01:45:17,210 --> 01:45:21,470
Yeah. And that's, I would say that
that's, that's fair. You know,

1701
01:45:21,530 --> 01:45:25,130
I think a lot of people are like that
and I think everyone's like that in one

1702
01:45:25,131 --> 01:45:27,110
way or another. You know?
And it's a spectrum.

1703
01:45:27,770 --> 01:45:31,790
But I've been in a situation where
someone say, Hey, do you know this guy?

1704
01:45:31,810 --> 01:45:34,280
He'll be like, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know. There'll be like, yeah,

1705
01:45:34,590 --> 01:45:38,660
you're friends with that guy, isn't
he hard to trust because of like this.

1706
01:45:38,690 --> 01:45:42,890
And I'll say,
I don't find them hard to trust.

1707
01:45:42,891 --> 01:45:44,240
I trust him to be him.

1708
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:47,820
And just exactly how you're saying you
trust the Scorpion to be a scorpion. Yeah.

1709
01:45:47,821 --> 01:45:48,240
You know,

1710
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:52,790
Scorpion can be relied upon for specific
things and straight up can't be relied

1711
01:45:52,791 --> 01:45:54,800
upon for certain other things.
So again,

1712
01:45:54,801 --> 01:45:57,320
if you just keep your
eyes open and you know,

1713
01:45:57,380 --> 01:45:59,690
don't start burning
bridges with the person.

1714
01:45:59,730 --> 01:46:02,270
If it's this small thing
as as time goes on,

1715
01:46:02,271 --> 01:46:06,740
you can start to get a feel of really
who this person is in the entirety and it

1716
01:46:06,741 --> 01:46:11,510
might be beneficial in the
in the situation you're in
with them. No, your people.

1717
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:15,230
I agree.
Next question.

1718
01:46:18,140 --> 01:46:19,310
Here's a strange one.

1719
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:26,620
I have ongoing regret for never joining
the military or police department and

1720
01:46:27,291 --> 01:46:31,670
I'm not yet strong enough to consider
changing careers now for financial

1721
01:46:31,671 --> 01:46:32,504
reasons.

1722
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:36,590
I also don't know how to discuss this
with my wife as we want to make some

1723
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:38,570
additions to the family soon.

1724
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:41,990
I feel unfulfilled in the
single aspect of my life.

1725
01:46:42,410 --> 01:46:46,700
It's a strange feeling considering I have
skyrocketed up the chain in my company

1726
01:46:46,701 --> 01:46:47,534
so quickly,

1727
01:46:48,470 --> 01:46:52,320
so many would do anything
to be where I find myself.

1728
01:46:52,650 --> 01:46:56,460
How do you overcome your face or how do
you overcome or face yourself knowing

1729
01:46:56,461 --> 01:47:01,050
you're holding back from a certain
calling because I really do see it as a

1730
01:47:01,051 --> 01:47:02,700
calling in some form.

1731
01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:07,380
I'm interested to hear from you.

1732
01:47:09,470 --> 01:47:14,120
I think this is pretty easy. Go join
the reserves. Hmm. Go join the reserves.

1733
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:17,120
Go in the army reserves,
go in there.

1734
01:47:17,290 --> 01:47:21,710
Like every branch has some reserves where
you're going to do one weekend a month,

1735
01:47:21,740 --> 01:47:26,210
you have to do bootcamp,
that'll be whatever it's going
to be 10 weeks, 12 weeks,

1736
01:47:26,211 --> 01:47:28,490
14 weeks depending on
which branch you go into.

1737
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:33,290
And then you do one weekend a month and
you do two weeks in the summer. You,

1738
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:36,500
you'll understand what the military
is about. There's actually a chance,

1739
01:47:36,830 --> 01:47:38,600
well first of all, there's a
chance you'd be deployed. I mean,

1740
01:47:38,601 --> 01:47:41,540
when we were in Iraq, you know,
when we deployed to Ramadi,

1741
01:47:41,541 --> 01:47:44,270
my second deployment to Iraq,
the, the unit that was there,

1742
01:47:44,271 --> 01:47:47,360
the two to eight iron soldiers, they
were reserve unit out of Pennsylvania.

1743
01:47:47,690 --> 01:47:50,810
They were awesome and they'd been doing
that for 14 months and they lost a lot

1744
01:47:50,811 --> 01:47:54,530
of guys and they fought hard.
So it's not like this reserve is thing is,

1745
01:47:54,570 --> 01:47:58,280
is is a different class a soldier,

1746
01:47:58,310 --> 01:48:01,100
they're soldiers for real.
They're marines for real.

1747
01:48:01,430 --> 01:48:03,080
Then you may be going on deployment.

1748
01:48:03,890 --> 01:48:08,390
But what's cool about it is most
companies, they will excuse you.

1749
01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:11,970
Basically when you go in the reserves,
they'll excuse you when you have time.

1750
01:48:11,971 --> 01:48:14,030
And in fact, I think it's,
I was never in the reserves,

1751
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:18,350
but I think you're actually protected by
the federal government from being fired

1752
01:48:18,351 --> 01:48:20,060
because you're serving in the reserves.

1753
01:48:20,510 --> 01:48:25,510
So I would definitely go and look into
the reserves because otherwise that

1754
01:48:26,421 --> 01:48:29,270
feeling that you have, I can only
imagine it's never going to go away.

1755
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:30,193
I don't know.

1756
01:48:30,590 --> 01:48:35,120
Because I had that feeling that I wanted
to do in the military when I was four

1757
01:48:35,121 --> 01:48:39,260
years old and I did it as soon
as I turned 18. So I don't,

1758
01:48:39,860 --> 01:48:43,240
you know, I, I, you know what
I regret now, I was like,
I want to still be in. Huh.

1759
01:48:43,340 --> 01:48:47,360
You know? So especially now with
the fighting picking up overseas,

1760
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:52,760
it's uh, you know, that's, that's the
only thing that, that I feel is, damn,

1761
01:48:53,330 --> 01:48:57,830
I want to go back. But if you never did
it at all, that's a grinding feeling.

1762
01:48:57,831 --> 01:49:01,070
So go talk to recruiter, getting
the reserves and you know what else?

1763
01:49:01,340 --> 01:49:05,130
In certain areas there's definitely
volunteer fire departments. Yeah,

1764
01:49:05,140 --> 01:49:08,030
you can volunteer as a fireman and
you can volunteer as a policeman.

1765
01:49:08,270 --> 01:49:10,080
They have certain, uh, I dunno,

1766
01:49:10,090 --> 01:49:12,710
I have no idea what state you're
from asking this question.

1767
01:49:12,711 --> 01:49:15,680
But there's deputies you can get
deputized, you can go through a,

1768
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:20,600
in San Diego they definitely have reserve
cops where you have to go to school,

1769
01:49:20,601 --> 01:49:25,490
you have to go to the police academy
and you become a reserve cop. So,

1770
01:49:26,150 --> 01:49:30,050
and with all that
you want to talk about it with your wife.

1771
01:49:30,050 --> 01:49:32,720
Talk about with your wife, you
know, you say you don't know how to,

1772
01:49:33,050 --> 01:49:35,840
this isn't a situation where you
can be totally honest with her. Hey,

1773
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:38,360
I always wanted to join the military.
I haven't done it.

1774
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:40,220
I feel like it's something
I really want to do.

1775
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:44,970
Here's the options I want to go look
at. What do you think? Now you're,

1776
01:49:45,010 --> 01:49:48,340
you're married, you're married to
a and you're going to have kids.

1777
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:52,540
It's your military service will be
harder on her than it is on you.

1778
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:57,220
So she better be strong, she
better be tough. And you know,

1779
01:49:57,520 --> 01:50:00,010
the military wives out there,
I mean my wife,

1780
01:50:00,011 --> 01:50:04,000
when I was gone and deployment after
deployment, it's, it's not easy.

1781
01:50:04,090 --> 01:50:09,090
I mean luckily she's tough and she raised
kids without me and she took care of

1782
01:50:11,170 --> 01:50:15,970
household without me and she went to the
hospital to visit my wounded guys and

1783
01:50:15,971 --> 01:50:19,870
she went to the funerals of my guys were
getting killed and she had to do that

1784
01:50:19,871 --> 01:50:21,910
while I was gone on deployment.
And I was,

1785
01:50:21,911 --> 01:50:24,070
she was hearing from me once a week maybe.

1786
01:50:25,570 --> 01:50:28,450
So you're gonna put your
family through a lot of stress.

1787
01:50:29,350 --> 01:50:34,300
Now you might stress your family a lot
by always having regret that they held

1788
01:50:34,301 --> 01:50:37,630
you back. That's selfish. But that's true.

1789
01:50:38,770 --> 01:50:42,100
So I would just go look into it,
see what the options are,

1790
01:50:42,101 --> 01:50:45,340
talk about it with your wife.
There are some really good benefits to it.

1791
01:50:45,610 --> 01:50:48,970
And also the final point is
sometimes when you're reservist,

1792
01:50:48,971 --> 01:50:53,110
you can decide that you want to go active
duty. Maybe you love it. Maybe you say,

1793
01:50:53,111 --> 01:50:53,950
yeah,
this was my calling.

1794
01:50:54,190 --> 01:50:57,760
Maybe you're fourth day in boot
camp where you haven't slept.

1795
01:50:57,761 --> 01:51:01,480
You had your head shaved, you're tired,
you're hungry, the food is horrible.

1796
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:04,390
And you say, man, this is what I've
always wanted to do with my life.

1797
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:09,010
And if that happens, there's options
where you can now go active duty and,

1798
01:51:09,011 --> 01:51:12,430
and you can see how your wife dealt with
it while you were gone and she dealt

1799
01:51:12,431 --> 01:51:14,200
with it. Well that's great. Hey,

1800
01:51:14,201 --> 01:51:16,890
let's make a career out of this
and that's a good option. Yeah.

1801
01:51:16,890 --> 01:51:21,350
And to do so there's some, I
think you're, this is, this is,

1802
01:51:21,351 --> 01:51:25,270
this is an easy day, easy, easy
problem to take care of. No factor.

1803
01:51:26,070 --> 01:51:27,850
Interesting.

1804
01:51:29,050 --> 01:51:31,150
Next question Jocko.

1805
01:51:31,151 --> 01:51:35,260
What's your take on sport
Jujitsu versus self defense?

1806
01:51:35,261 --> 01:51:38,130
Jujitsu and can support Transport Jujitsu?

1807
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:40,780
Can it translate onto the street?

1808
01:51:41,110 --> 01:51:44,590
Most schools are geared towards sport.
Yeah.

1809
01:51:44,591 --> 01:51:47,650
So for anyone that's listening
that doesn't do Jujitsu,

1810
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:51,880
both of you that are out there, that
don't do together listening, first of all,

1811
01:51:51,970 --> 01:51:54,700
do Jujitsu. Uh, second of all. So there's,

1812
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:59,760
there's Jujitsu is rooted really in self
defense and like anything that gets put

1813
01:52:03,580 --> 01:52:04,840
into a,

1814
01:52:06,850 --> 01:52:08,980
a closed environment,

1815
01:52:09,580 --> 01:52:12,970
it starts to breed and
become different and mutate.

1816
01:52:13,420 --> 01:52:16,520
And so Jujitsu in a way,
what they called,

1817
01:52:16,530 --> 01:52:21,530
what they now call sport Jujitsu is
Jujitsu that has been in this competition

1818
01:52:22,391 --> 01:52:25,210
environment, in the Jujitsu
sport competition environment.

1819
01:52:25,390 --> 01:52:27,550
So Jujitsu is a sport
as well as self defense.

1820
01:52:27,551 --> 01:52:31,360
It's a sport with points and you can win
on points and they have championships

1821
01:52:31,361 --> 01:52:33,160
and it's very competitive and it's,

1822
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:37,390
it's pretty entertaining to watch
if you know and understand the game.

1823
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:43,150
But since it's in this environment,
this closed environment,

1824
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:46,580
it starts to mutate.
And that's what's happened.

1825
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:50,660
So for instance,
there is maneuvers that you do in,

1826
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:55,780
in Sport Jujitsu that are so
intricate and they're so reliant on,

1827
01:52:59,750 --> 01:53:03,020
for instance, reliant on the
Geeky, that Jujitsu uniform,

1828
01:53:03,021 --> 01:53:05,590
which is a heavy fabric [inaudible].

1829
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:10,310
And you can actually use parts
of the Geeky to choke people.

1830
01:53:10,370 --> 01:53:13,270
And you can use parts of the Geeky to,
uh,

1831
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:17,660
make a person off balance
called a sweep and get on top.

1832
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:21,440
You can literally take the lapel of their
key and put it between their legs and

1833
01:53:21,441 --> 01:53:25,130
wrap it around your leg and then grab
the geeky there and it's gonna and then

1834
01:53:25,131 --> 01:53:27,230
you just swing your hips and is
going to pull them off balance.

1835
01:53:27,230 --> 01:53:29,690
Now this is something you could
literally never do in the street.

1836
01:53:31,550 --> 01:53:35,780
So that's what they're talking about
when they're talking about sport versus

1837
01:53:35,781 --> 01:53:37,820
self defense.
And they have this with other things.

1838
01:53:37,821 --> 01:53:42,821
I mean there's sport shooting
where they do certain and it's,

1839
01:53:43,330 --> 01:53:46,550
it's semi realistic. Just
like Jujitsu, semi realistic.

1840
01:53:46,551 --> 01:53:50,150
When you go in a tournament,
it's somewhat simulates a street fight,

1841
01:53:50,540 --> 01:53:54,560
just like some shooting competitions,
somewhat simulate combat,

1842
01:53:55,130 --> 01:53:58,670
but they're not exact.
And so the question is,

1843
01:53:58,700 --> 01:54:01,100
does the sport translate onto the street?

1844
01:54:02,150 --> 01:54:06,980
And my answer to that
is, first of all, yes,

1845
01:54:06,981 --> 01:54:10,010
it does. Not every move, certainly,

1846
01:54:10,011 --> 01:54:14,720
and there's absolutely moves that you
would do in Jujitsu in a tournament that

1847
01:54:14,721 --> 01:54:16,550
you would never do on the street.

1848
01:54:16,551 --> 01:54:20,810
Now luckily anybody who's good enough to
do those advanced moves in a tournament

1849
01:54:21,770 --> 01:54:24,770
is good enough that in the street,
they're not going to need those moves.

1850
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:29,270
You're not going to need to do a
reverse Alma Plata in the street.

1851
01:54:29,300 --> 01:54:31,850
You're not going to need to do,
um,

1852
01:54:32,660 --> 01:54:36,350
donkey guard in the street.
[inaudible] right?

1853
01:54:36,351 --> 01:54:38,210
You're not going to need to do
bear and Bolo in the street.

1854
01:54:38,211 --> 01:54:39,590
You're just not going to need to do it.

1855
01:54:40,070 --> 01:54:42,530
If you're fighting someone that
that's good, well then guess what?

1856
01:54:42,531 --> 01:54:43,520
I guess you didn't need it,

1857
01:54:43,521 --> 01:54:46,190
but you're not going to come up against
a person in the street that's going to

1858
01:54:46,191 --> 01:54:50,430
have a counter to your bare and Bolo
attack and you don't have a Guianan.

1859
01:54:50,450 --> 01:54:53,120
So that's not going to work. I mean,
there are some Nogi versus that.

1860
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:58,160
The bottom line is if
you're doing Jujitsu, you're
definitely going to do very,

1861
01:54:58,161 --> 01:55:03,050
very well in a street fight.
Now that being said,

1862
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:08,210
that being said,
sometimes you know what you gotta do.

1863
01:55:08,390 --> 01:55:12,590
You gotta train Jujitsu for the street.
You got to, you got to punch each other.

1864
01:55:13,250 --> 01:55:15,110
Occasionally you got to
say, Hey, you know what?

1865
01:55:15,320 --> 01:55:18,440
Let's go live a little bit and we'll
do some, maybe you put gloves on.

1866
01:55:18,441 --> 01:55:19,760
Maybe you put MMA gloves on.

1867
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:24,710
Maybe just use open hands and you smack
each other and you realize like, Oh,

1868
01:55:24,711 --> 01:55:28,130
when I'm on the bottom and the half
guard where I feel super comfortable when

1869
01:55:28,131 --> 01:55:30,050
I'm doing Jujitsu,
if I'm in a real fight,

1870
01:55:30,051 --> 01:55:32,630
I'm going to be getting headbutted or
I'm going to be getting punched in the

1871
01:55:32,631 --> 01:55:37,130
face and that's not good. So what
do I do to get out of this? Um,

1872
01:55:38,270 --> 01:55:42,760
do you know, even in the guard can
be horrible on the bottom. Yeah. Um,

1873
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:44,100
did you don't want to be on the bottom

1874
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:46,140
anyways in a fight. You
don't want to, you don't.

1875
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:49,640
The bottom line is you don't want to
grapple if you don't have to. Yeah.

1876
01:55:50,310 --> 01:55:52,410
You don't want to be in a
street fight in the first place.

1877
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:55,470
The reason you're in a street
place cause you could not avoid it.

1878
01:55:55,471 --> 01:55:59,340
That's why you're in a street fight. You
could not avoid it. You got attacked,

1879
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:03,330
you got taken down to the ground because
even if someone swings at you and you

1880
01:56:03,340 --> 01:56:06,570
can still get away from you, they
haven't grabbed you yet. Runaway. Cool.

1881
01:56:09,090 --> 01:56:13,560
So train Jujitsu with punches. Also
trained boxing, wartime wrestling.

1882
01:56:14,550 --> 01:56:17,010
And also work on some real scenarios.

1883
01:56:18,030 --> 01:56:20,910
Work on the headlock and I've seen this,

1884
01:56:20,911 --> 01:56:25,080
where do you get a a guy that's really
just come into the game and jump straight?

1885
01:56:25,081 --> 01:56:27,570
You know these young kids, they
come into the game, they start,

1886
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:31,560
the first thing they want to
learn is the rubber guard.

1887
01:56:31,650 --> 01:56:33,870
The first thing they want
to learn is the Omoplata.

1888
01:56:33,871 --> 01:56:35,610
The first thing they want to
learn is it bare and Bolo.

1889
01:56:35,611 --> 01:56:37,140
That's like the first
thing they want to learn.

1890
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:41,430
And literally someone will put them in a
headlock and they won't know what to do

1891
01:56:41,790 --> 01:56:42,720
because it's different.

1892
01:56:42,810 --> 01:56:46,080
Just like just like a bear and
Bolo requires to neck technique.

1893
01:56:46,530 --> 01:56:50,310
The headlock escape requires some
technique to get out of that.

1894
01:56:50,700 --> 01:56:52,650
So work on that.
Work on the bear hug,

1895
01:56:52,651 --> 01:56:57,651
work on the the arm grab and the risk
grab and the the the straight arm choke in

1896
01:56:59,071 --> 01:57:00,680
big looping punches that you're gonna see.

1897
01:57:00,690 --> 01:57:03,630
And I'll tell you sometimes dean
will teach a self defense class.

1898
01:57:03,990 --> 01:57:06,810
And when Dean teaches a self defense
class, every time he teaches one,

1899
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:10,770
I learned something. I'm like, man,
that's a good little technique.

1900
01:57:10,771 --> 01:57:15,060
He just showed how to get out of
this, how to get out of that. So

1901
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:20,370
bottom line, yes, you can, it it,

1902
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:26,460
sport Jujitsu for the most part
translates into the street.

1903
01:57:27,180 --> 01:57:32,040
And if you're good enough at Sports
Jujitsu that you're competing at a high

1904
01:57:32,041 --> 01:57:36,720
level, even purple belt in up, you're
not going to need to use any sports.

1905
01:57:36,721 --> 01:57:37,650
Jujitsu moves in the street,

1906
01:57:37,651 --> 01:57:40,120
you're going to be destroying
somewhat in a street fight. Yeah.

1907
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:44,360
If you end up in that situation. Yeah.
The, the, it's a Spec, especially now,

1908
01:57:44,370 --> 01:57:49,220
just like, are you saying the Jujitsu
has evolved and kind of mutated,

1909
01:57:49,240 --> 01:57:51,140
morphed, um, in,

1910
01:57:51,141 --> 01:57:55,860
in the gyms now a petri dish Jujitsu's
that can, a petri dish, it's growing.

1911
01:57:55,890 --> 01:57:57,180
It just grows on its own.

1912
01:57:57,181 --> 01:58:00,930
It turns in this weird fungus and it gets
all different looking and it does look

1913
01:58:00,931 --> 01:58:05,460
different. Yeah. It does look
different than it did. You
know, even like, I remember,

1914
01:58:05,461 --> 01:58:06,900
I remember Dean when I were
talking about the other day,

1915
01:58:06,901 --> 01:58:11,160
we would remember when the
Omoplata came out. Hmm. You know,

1916
01:58:11,190 --> 01:58:15,990
I think it was like 1996 we started
seeing the Oma plot and we, oh man.

1917
01:58:16,260 --> 01:58:19,340
And it looks very fancy.
It looks very,

1918
01:58:19,370 --> 01:58:23,040
it's a fancy looking move and now,
now because of the Internet,

1919
01:58:23,041 --> 01:58:24,000
because so many people are,

1920
01:58:24,030 --> 01:58:27,330
it's exploding how rapidly
it's changing and mutating.

1921
01:58:27,331 --> 01:58:30,270
It's mutating faster now
than it ever has. Yeah, yeah.

1922
01:58:30,271 --> 01:58:34,470
And that's part of the beauty of it
I think in, you know, in most ways,

1923
01:58:35,010 --> 01:58:39,240
um, the, it's a spectrum though,
right? If you went from one side,

1924
01:58:39,241 --> 01:58:42,010
which is just the basic,
the original basic,

1925
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,650
you know, take down mountain
side, Mount Guard, all this,

1926
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:48,550
all the way to worm guard
something that that or,

1927
01:58:48,551 --> 01:58:51,480
or baron bullet for example,
where, so sport, Jujitsu,

1928
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:53,560
if you want to narrow it
down, it's, it's, it's,

1929
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:59,460
if it's something where the moves or
whatever you're doing is dependent on the

1930
01:59:00,101 --> 01:59:03,700
sport elements of it.
So it's dependent that you have a mat,

1931
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:07,990
it's dependent that you have a g
and a belt. So if you do warm guard,

1932
01:59:08,020 --> 01:59:12,970
that's highly dependent on the guy
having a geeky with the lapel out.

1933
01:59:13,220 --> 01:59:15,700
And eventually someone's going to figure
out how to do warm guard without it.

1934
01:59:15,701 --> 01:59:19,160
They'll figure out some variation for
sure. They may have already. Yeah. Yeah.

1935
01:59:19,161 --> 01:59:24,080
So it should Keenan's working
on the pioneer. So, um,

1936
01:59:24,130 --> 01:59:26,510
it's like, you know, just to kind
of put it into define terms, right,

1937
01:59:27,400 --> 01:59:32,400
so self defense I think now is you may
find a gym that's only does sport where

1938
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:40,990
if you came in no experience and then you
know, three, four or five years later,

1939
01:59:41,530 --> 01:59:45,490
your sport Jujitsu might not take
you very far in the street. It's,

1940
01:59:45,610 --> 01:59:48,820
it'd be rare I think. But you could
probably find the school like that.

1941
01:59:48,850 --> 01:59:52,180
I don't know where they are but,
but I think just like what you're saying,

1942
01:59:52,210 --> 01:59:56,440
when you make it to purple belt,
you're the basic Jujitsu.

1943
01:59:56,860 --> 02:00:00,070
We'll win on the street. And
really when, if you go to a school,

1944
02:00:00,071 --> 02:00:03,040
like even though the original Gracie
academy in Torrance, if you go there,

1945
02:00:03,041 --> 02:00:03,560
the self,

1946
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:08,560
the self defense pursuit in Jujitsu
is more of it is it's tactic based.

1947
02:00:10,110 --> 02:00:14,620
Like mentally it's not specific moves.
It's distance management.

1948
02:00:14,650 --> 02:00:19,380
It's where your mindset is in the
guard. Your, your, your pursuit,

1949
02:00:19,420 --> 02:00:24,340
your goal in the guard is way different
than in a, in a tournament or something.

1950
02:00:24,730 --> 02:00:27,400
They won't, they'll say don't even
go for submissions right here.

1951
02:00:27,430 --> 02:00:29,590
It's not your job to do
submissions right here.

1952
02:00:29,620 --> 02:00:32,720
I was going to say that you said is
dependent on the gates to sports you use

1953
02:00:32,721 --> 02:00:34,150
depending on the Guid,
depending on the mat,

1954
02:00:34,151 --> 02:00:37,180
it's also dependent on the rules and
spending it on an opponent that knows

1955
02:00:37,181 --> 02:00:38,420
Jujitsu.
Yes.

1956
02:00:38,590 --> 02:00:40,640
Depended on somebody that knows what
they're doing cause they're going counter

1957
02:00:40,641 --> 02:00:43,630
of what you're doing in order to make
something work. Absolutely right. Yeah.

1958
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:47,150
So the,
if you go back to the self defense,

1959
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:52,800
you're going to be learning basically how
to protect yourself given what Jujitsu

1960
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:54,910
is. That's, that's it. In sport,

1961
02:00:54,940 --> 02:00:57,880
you're going to be learning
how to score points,

1962
02:00:58,270 --> 02:01:01,450
how to control a certain guy
with this specific uniform,

1963
02:01:01,480 --> 02:01:02,830
how to utilize that uniform.

1964
02:01:02,831 --> 02:01:06,040
How do you utilize the mat and that's
another thing that's messed up.

1965
02:01:06,041 --> 02:01:09,820
Like in the IB, Jj, after the
official rules of Jujitsu,

1966
02:01:10,150 --> 02:01:13,000
there's some things that
you're not allowed to do right.

1967
02:01:13,090 --> 02:01:15,340
And that's not good.

1968
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:20,880
They should allow these things in
regards to pursuing self a sport.

1969
02:01:21,160 --> 02:01:23,410
It's a sport really when
it comes down to it. Yeah.

1970
02:01:23,411 --> 02:01:27,460
I guess you can put whatever rules you
want. Yeah, but you shouldn't. Yeah.

1971
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:33,070
Yeah. If you, if you don't mind
the deviation from self defense,

1972
02:01:33,071 --> 02:01:35,530
if you don't mind that, then put
whatever rules you want. But yeah,

1973
02:01:35,531 --> 02:01:39,770
I would say you shouldn't. If you care
about the more rules you in the sport

1974
02:01:40,050 --> 02:01:43,190
gets, the less effective it
becomes. I unfortunately.

1975
02:01:43,270 --> 02:01:47,780
And so they need to stop with the rules.
Yeah. And it's the same thing with judo.

1976
02:01:47,781 --> 02:01:51,080
It's the same thing with wrestling.
I mean wrestling in America, if they,

1977
02:01:51,110 --> 02:01:56,090
if they allowed submission holds
in wrestling in America, you know,

1978
02:01:56,120 --> 02:02:00,200
America would be insane with fighters.
We've done pretty good.

1979
02:02:00,201 --> 02:02:03,080
But can you imagine if every high school
kid that wrestled knew how to do all

1980
02:02:03,081 --> 02:02:06,500
submissions? They'd be nuts. That's the
way it should be. I wish it was that way.

1981
02:02:06,501 --> 02:02:10,460
I wish the world was that way.
It would be a better place.

1982
02:02:11,310 --> 02:02:14,840
But they, what they did is, what they
did is with wrestling, they took,

1983
02:02:15,110 --> 02:02:19,010
they took submission holds out because
they considered it to be dangerous in

1984
02:02:19,011 --> 02:02:22,760
judo is a clock is a classic example
where they remove the double leg.

1985
02:02:22,761 --> 02:02:25,880
Like you can't do a straight
double leg in a tournament anymore.

1986
02:02:25,940 --> 02:02:28,040
You have to set it up.
It has to be off for something else.

1987
02:02:28,041 --> 02:02:31,610
Cause because wrestlers were coming in
and dominating and judo tournament just

1988
02:02:31,611 --> 02:02:34,310
hitting double legs cause cause
they're awesome at Adam. Right.

1989
02:02:34,700 --> 02:02:39,700
And it's the same thing now you see
with with Jujitsu in Ibj JF there,

1990
02:02:41,030 --> 02:02:43,160
you know with the,
with the no heel hooks,

1991
02:02:43,670 --> 02:02:46,360
even at a black belt level you're
not allowed to do, he'll hooks.

1992
02:02:46,361 --> 02:02:47,460
So that completely changed it.

1993
02:02:47,461 --> 02:02:51,680
Some parts of the Games and it doesn't
change and where it was going to make you

1994
02:02:51,681 --> 02:02:55,460
lose in a street fight.
But it definitely puts a stop to the,

1995
02:02:55,700 --> 02:02:58,460
to the growth of the sport
in terms of technique.

1996
02:02:58,730 --> 02:03:03,530
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So exactly
what you were saying, how the sport,

1997
02:03:04,820 --> 02:03:08,140
the rules and stuff, all that
does is, is narrowed down the,

1998
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:13,100
the sport part of it and the more people
who pursue it for sport, not just sport,

1999
02:03:13,101 --> 02:03:16,960
but sport. If pursuing Jiu Jitsu for sport
is part of your game as part of your,

2000
02:03:16,980 --> 02:03:18,050
your goals or whatever,

2001
02:03:18,440 --> 02:03:21,890
and then now the sport has become
this limited thing where you can't,

2002
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:24,770
like there's 20% of moves you can't do,

2003
02:03:24,890 --> 02:03:26,510
you're gonna spend way
less time practicing them.

2004
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:30,620
You'd be way less effective at these
moves that are a part of grappling,

2005
02:03:30,621 --> 02:03:34,700
a huge part of grappling
ultimately. So. So yeah,

2006
02:03:34,790 --> 02:03:37,850
you're still going to have that huge
overlap for sure. If you know mount,

2007
02:03:37,851 --> 02:03:40,850
which is probably the first thing,
you would have your first Jujitsu class,

2008
02:03:40,851 --> 02:03:41,684
you're going to learn mount,

2009
02:03:41,900 --> 02:03:45,800
which is theoretically the most
dominant position you can have.

2010
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:49,310
So you're going to learn mount, take
what to do when the guy flips you over,

2011
02:03:49,311 --> 02:03:51,620
what to do in the guard, how to
function. You know these things.

2012
02:03:51,650 --> 02:03:53,480
That's what's going to
get you by in the street.

2013
02:03:53,630 --> 02:03:58,050
That's what's going to going to make
you effective in an actual fight. Yeah.

2014
02:03:58,520 --> 02:04:02,960
And then, you know, like, like anything,
all these offshoots that grow, you know,

2015
02:04:02,961 --> 02:04:06,140
they, you know, there's some
overlap for sure. But, um, if,

2016
02:04:07,790 --> 02:04:10,400
if you go into a tournament
that's a specific pursuit.

2017
02:04:10,430 --> 02:04:15,260
If you want to defend yourself,
that's a specific pursuit now.

2018
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:16,790
And as time goes on,

2019
02:04:16,791 --> 02:04:21,310
they're going to start to draw out that
there's a lot of overlap right now and

2020
02:04:21,350 --> 02:04:23,240
in the future there'll be less.
Yeah.

2021
02:04:23,250 --> 02:04:27,170
Has the way that they're putting rules
over the sport. Yeah. And, and just,

2022
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:31,700
and the sport in general and
the sport mutating. Yeah.
Yeah. So you know, the sport,

2023
02:04:31,701 --> 02:04:34,670
depending on the,
depending on the fact that there's a mat,

2024
02:04:34,730 --> 02:04:38,520
like if you tried to do a burn Bolo in
the street with on the road or something,

2025
02:04:38,521 --> 02:04:41,670
it's just the way that
you spin on the mat. Yeah.

2026
02:04:41,700 --> 02:04:42,840
There's too much friction on the street.

2027
02:04:42,841 --> 02:04:45,520
It'd be definitely one that
would make it hard. Yes, you can.

2028
02:04:45,540 --> 02:04:47,280
The grass would make it hard.
Yeah.

2029
02:04:47,700 --> 02:04:51,090
I haven't tried to bear them Bolo on the
street. Go get a fight. Pick a fight.

2030
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:55,320
Yeah, but both are good. I think it's fun.

2031
02:04:55,590 --> 02:04:59,340
You can't help but really
like, cause because when you
go to Jujitsu you're like,

2032
02:04:59,341 --> 02:05:03,120
hey, this is basically a fight. Yeah.
We can train full speed and be safe.

2033
02:05:03,150 --> 02:05:05,970
It's a fight. That's what makes
it so fun because when you win,

2034
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,370
the payoff is so good on the
inside and when you lose,

2035
02:05:08,371 --> 02:05:12,090
it's like you still get that detriment.
That's still, you still have that feeling.

2036
02:05:12,091 --> 02:05:15,540
But at the end of the day, you know you
lived, you're not enemies with the guy,

2037
02:05:15,541 --> 02:05:17,700
you're not injured, nothing
like that. So it makes it this,

2038
02:05:17,701 --> 02:05:19,590
this wind when the whole time.
Right.

2039
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:24,060
And when you see a cool move like warm
guard when like you're controlling one

2040
02:05:24,061 --> 02:05:27,660
guy with your weird foot that face this
way in one hand and the guy can't even

2041
02:05:27,661 --> 02:05:30,530
stand up. Yeah. That's
all fun. Yeah. It's like,

2042
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:33,120
oh I have this super power and
wielding, you know, in the Mat.

2043
02:05:33,160 --> 02:05:35,730
He can't help it pursue those fun
thing. Bear and bull though. You get,

2044
02:05:35,731 --> 02:05:38,160
it's like you're a break
dancer doing some cool stuff.

2045
02:05:38,161 --> 02:05:39,900
Meanwhile you're dominating the guy.
While you're dead,

2046
02:05:40,260 --> 02:05:44,130
you can't help but do that stuff. It's so
fun, you know? Yeah. So you can't, I mean,

2047
02:05:44,190 --> 02:05:46,700
I don't think you can really
hate him. The sport. No, I don't.

2048
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:50,910
I don't hate on a sport. Yeah, no, no, no,
no, no. I'm saying good, but some people,

2049
02:05:50,911 --> 02:05:54,190
do you know how even just the
question cut, not that the,

2050
02:05:54,320 --> 02:05:56,040
the person who asked this
question thinks this,

2051
02:05:56,041 --> 02:05:59,520
but it implies that there is a
little bit of a climate of, Oh yeah,

2052
02:05:59,700 --> 02:06:03,480
I got a receipt. If you don't like the
bear and Bolo, learn to defend against it.

2053
02:06:03,630 --> 02:06:06,600
No. Yeah. You know what I mean?
Sure. If you don't like Robert Gard,

2054
02:06:06,601 --> 02:06:09,300
cool learning to defend against
it. Yup. That's my opinion.

2055
02:06:09,330 --> 02:06:13,470
Because if it's working
then credit. Yup. Yup.

2056
02:06:13,590 --> 02:06:18,070
You either effective or ineffective.
My brother Leif Babin said,

2057
02:06:22,570 --> 02:06:26,970
yeah, let's do one more.
One more. Okay. Jocko,

2058
02:06:26,971 --> 02:06:31,560
a lot of your advice applies to leading
yourself, not just leading others.

2059
02:06:32,220 --> 02:06:35,280
Self-Help quote unquote is a loaded word.

2060
02:06:35,310 --> 02:06:37,380
So let's say self management.

2061
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:43,050
What is the one change readers should
make today to start improving themselves

2062
02:06:43,230 --> 02:06:44,280
and their situation?

2063
02:06:46,240 --> 02:06:48,190
I don't really like those words.

2064
02:06:48,850 --> 02:06:52,140
Self help or self management
or self improvement.

2065
02:06:54,220 --> 02:06:58,900
I don't really like what those words
have come to mean these days because

2066
02:06:58,901 --> 02:07:02,470
there's a lot of people out there
that are constantly trying to improve

2067
02:07:02,471 --> 02:07:06,610
themselves by looking for the one change,

2068
02:07:07,750 --> 02:07:09,400
the one change,
right?

2069
02:07:09,401 --> 02:07:13,150
The one change in their life that's
gonna make their dreams come true

2070
02:07:15,420 --> 02:07:18,780
and even worse. On top of that,
there's a lot of people out there,

2071
02:07:18,781 --> 02:07:23,781
a lot of self help gurus
and these hyperactive
motivational speakers and these

2072
02:07:25,321 --> 02:07:30,321
other self appointed modern Zen Yoga
warriors that they're trying to sell.

2073
02:07:31,260 --> 02:07:36,160
The one thing they're trying to sell
the nine steps are the enlightened path

2074
02:07:36,161 --> 02:07:41,161
that's going to allow you to unlock all
of your human potential and fulfill the

2075
02:07:41,501 --> 02:07:46,000
dreams so you can live the life that
you've, you've always wanted to live.

2076
02:07:49,140 --> 02:07:53,160
Now I'm no guru,
Hey,

2077
02:07:53,170 --> 02:07:56,030
and I definitely don't claim to be,
I'm just a man.

2078
02:07:58,010 --> 02:07:59,870
But I will tell you this,

2079
02:08:00,020 --> 02:08:05,020
it isn't one thing and it isn't 10
things and it isn't a hundred things.

2080
02:08:05,950 --> 02:08:10,720
It isn't a quick path and
there are no shortcuts

2081
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:13,730
in meditation,

2082
02:08:13,850 --> 02:08:18,850
won't get you there and neither will a
miracle drug or an organic supplement or

2083
02:08:19,161 --> 02:08:20,610
some super food.

2084
02:08:22,250 --> 02:08:22,950
Yeah.

2085
02:08:22,950 --> 02:08:27,950
Getting better isn't a hack or a trick
or a one change that you need to make.

2086
02:08:30,610 --> 02:08:31,350
Okay.

2087
02:08:31,350 --> 02:08:35,400
Getting better is a campaign.
It's a campaign.

2088
02:08:35,401 --> 02:08:39,030
It's a daily, a weekly.
It's an hour leaf fight.

2089
02:08:40,310 --> 02:08:40,950
Yeah.

2090
02:08:40,950 --> 02:08:45,900
An incessant fight that
doesn't stop against weakness
and against temptation and

2091
02:08:45,901 --> 02:08:48,600
against laziness. It's a
campaign. A discipline.

2092
02:08:49,690 --> 02:08:50,090
Okay.

2093
02:08:50,090 --> 02:08:52,820
The campaign of hard work and dedication.

2094
02:08:52,940 --> 02:08:57,590
It's waking up early and going to bed
late and grinding out every second in

2095
02:08:57,591 --> 02:09:01,070
between every single day.

2096
02:09:04,330 --> 02:09:06,850
So you want to get better.

2097
02:09:07,730 --> 02:09:08,180
Yeah.

2098
02:09:08,180 --> 02:09:12,650
You want to self improve.
Stop looking for a shortcut

2099
02:09:14,250 --> 02:09:17,730
and go find your alarm clock.
Find your discipline.

2100
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:19,230
Yeah.

2101
02:09:19,230 --> 02:09:23,880
And flank your guts and your
passion and your drive and find it.

2102
02:09:23,890 --> 02:09:28,850
You will.
And then,

2103
02:09:31,060 --> 02:09:35,810
then you will find
your freedom.

2104
02:09:39,640 --> 02:09:42,880
And I think that's all
I've got for tonight. So

2105
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:49,600
I'll you troopers out there,
out on the front lines,

2106
02:09:49,720 --> 02:09:54,720
fighting against evil or fighting against
crime or fighting against fires or

2107
02:09:55,331 --> 02:09:57,010
fighting to make things happen,

2108
02:09:59,960 --> 02:10:00,381
fighting.

2109
02:10:00,381 --> 02:10:05,090
They get ahead and make something out of
this little bit of time that we've got.

2110
02:10:07,470 --> 02:10:09,840
Thanks for joining us in the fight.

2111
02:10:11,720 --> 02:10:13,560
And if you want to keep
the conversation going,

2112
02:10:13,710 --> 02:10:18,710
you can find us on the interwebs at Jocko
Willink and echo is at Echo Charles.

2113
02:10:22,120 --> 02:10:22,390
Okay.

2114
02:10:22,390 --> 02:10:24,910
And if you want to support the podcast,

2115
02:10:25,950 --> 02:10:28,510
Echo's going to tell you
how there's a few ways,

2116
02:10:30,460 --> 02:10:34,070
easiest way, my opinion before
you do your Amazon shopping.

2117
02:10:34,520 --> 02:10:39,110
When you shop on amazon.com go to Jocko
podcast.com and then we have an Amazon

2118
02:10:39,111 --> 02:10:42,350
link there. You Click on there
and um, then you do shopping,

2119
02:10:43,190 --> 02:10:46,850
whether you buy a book or or whatever
or some batteries, some duck tape.

2120
02:10:48,170 --> 02:10:53,170
Also there is a Jocko store where you can
get shirts or coffee mugs or stickers.

2121
02:10:56,090 --> 02:10:59,630
You can support us by doing that
if you like the shirts. If not,

2122
02:10:59,631 --> 02:11:04,430
then obviously not. Um, and then, um,
if you want to take some supplements,

2123
02:11:04,460 --> 02:11:07,340
I recommend the good ones,
the ones that actually work,

2124
02:11:09,160 --> 02:11:13,220
and those are made by on it.
So if you go to on it.com/jocko,

2125
02:11:13,340 --> 02:11:16,190
you can get 10% off all supplements.

2126
02:11:17,660 --> 02:11:22,550
You can also support the podcast by
listening to it, by downloading it,

2127
02:11:22,640 --> 02:11:27,440
by subscribing to it, and by reviewing
it or wherever you listen to it.

2128
02:11:27,500 --> 02:11:31,430
Get on there and put a review on there.
Tell people what you think.

2129
02:11:32,690 --> 02:11:37,400
You can also get a book called extreme
ownership that was written by myself and

2130
02:11:37,401 --> 02:11:38,810
my brother Leif Babin.

2131
02:11:39,920 --> 02:11:44,060
And you can get it on digital hardcover.

2132
02:11:44,750 --> 02:11:49,730
You can get it on audio, which is
actually read by Leif Babin and myself.

2133
02:11:51,670 --> 02:11:53,800
And when you get done

2134
02:11:55,330 --> 02:11:59,200
supporting the podcast and
supporting the cause here,

2135
02:12:00,820 --> 02:12:04,600
go out there and do something
to support yourself,

2136
02:12:06,370 --> 02:12:08,560
to make yourself better.

2137
02:12:10,330 --> 02:12:13,990
Get out there into the world

2138
02:12:15,790 --> 02:12:16,660
and get after it.

2139
02:12:19,090 --> 02:12:23,470
And so until next time,
this is Jocko and echo

2140
02:12:25,120 --> 02:12:25,540
out.
