00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,610
This is Jocko podcast number
62 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,180
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,840
The smallest detail taken from an actual
incident in war is more instructive for

4
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:24,300
me, a soldier than all the peers
and Germany's in the world.

5
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,240
They speak no doubt for the
heads of states and armies,

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,670
but they never show me what I wish
to know. A battalion, a company,

7
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:36,690
a squad.
