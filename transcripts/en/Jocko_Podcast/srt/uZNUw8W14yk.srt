1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:06,020
This is Jocko podcast number
one 61 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,170
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:12,973
Okay.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,370
I do the wrong.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,630
And first begin to brawl the
secret mischiefs that I said,

6
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:25,500
a brooch I lay unto the
grievous charge of others,

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,930
Clarence,
whom I indeed have cast in darkness.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,920
I do bu weep to many simple goals,

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,160
namely to Derby Hustings Buckingham and
tell them tis the queen and her allies

10
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:46,830
that stirred the king against the Duke.
My brother

11
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:54,610
now they believe it and with all
wet me to be revenged on rivers,

12
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,590
Dorset Gray.

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,120
But then I sigh and with a
piece of scripture tell them
that God bids us do good

14
00:01:08,091 --> 00:01:09,020
for evil.

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,140
And thus I close my naked villainy with
odd old end stolen out of holy writ and

16
00:01:20,741 --> 00:01:25,741
seen a saint when most I play the devil.

17
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:36,070
And that right there is a
few lines from the play,

18
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,510
Richard,
the third written by

19
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,490
good old William Shakespeare,

20
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,270
the Bard and

21
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,890
clearly Richard.
The third is uh,

22
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,530
made out in this play to be an evil
like a hundred percent evil political

23
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,790
maneuverer.
That's what he's made out to be.

24
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:11,150
Sort of the ultimate archetype
of the Mac of Alien Machiavellian

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,233
leader.

26
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,970
And there's people that say what
and it's, it's actually, it's see,

27
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:25,320
certainly seems that Shakespeare
intentionally wrote him that way.

28
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:26,101
And there's a bunch of things,

29
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:29,960
I guess at some point we'll go over the
whole play of Richard the third, but

30
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,333
okay,

31
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,860
let's take a look at the lines that debt,
you know,

32
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:36,750
cause because Machiavellian what we've,

33
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,780
what we think of it when we hear it now
is we think that it means someone that

34
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:47,820
is just completely devious and completely
dishonest and completely deceitful in

35
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:50,040
their quest for power. Yeah. Right.

36
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:53,880
That's what people think of when
they think of Machiavellian. And

37
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,500
definitely I think Richard,

38
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:02,170
the third is made to be and
was written to be sort of the,

39
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,340
the quintessential
machiavellian character.

40
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,170
Let's look at these lines a
little bit. Um, because as I said,

41
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:14,380
when we did Henry the
fifth on podcast number 15,

42
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:18,970
you're not gunna know exactly what
Shakespeare is talking about because he's

43
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:22,420
writing in an almost in another language.
So not quite,

44
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,400
you can still understand it.
It doesn't take much.

45
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:27,580
But there's some things going on in there.
So it starts off,

46
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,010
I do the wrong and first begin to brawl.

47
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,040
So was he saying there I am the one
that is doing something that is wrong.

48
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,680
I'm the one that's starting the fights.
Yeah, that's what's going on here.

49
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:43,450
I'm starting to fights and then he says
the secret mischiefs that I set a brooch,

50
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,960
I lay unto the grievous charge of others.

51
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:51,990
So these bad behaviors
that he's undertaking that
he's secretly undertaking,

52
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,480
he is blaming them on other people.

53
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,620
He then goes on to say Clarence,

54
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,520
whom I indeed have cast in darkness and
you wouldn't quite understand this but

55
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,730
unless you read it,
but his brother clearance,

56
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,030
he put his brother Clarence into prison

57
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,720
and then he says,
I do blue weep to many simple goals.

58
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,700
So he in front of other people,

59
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,510
he cries and bemoans
that Oh poor clearance.

60
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,580
But he thinks these people are fools,
namely Derby, hustings and Buckingham,

61
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:28,750
which is what he says in the next line.

62
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:30,970
And then he says that he
tells those same people,

63
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,400
he tells those people that it's the
queen and her allies. And tell them,

64
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,200
tis the queen and her allies. He's,
he's saying like, look, this is,

65
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,880
this isn't about me. It's about the queen.
She's the one that's doing all this.

66
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,490
She's the one that stir
the king against the Duke,

67
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:51,760
my brother. So it's not, it's
not my fault. It's the queen.

68
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,880
And then he says, now they
believe it in with all whipped me,

69
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,530
meaning they believe it. And then
they're egging him on like you need.

70
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:03,640
You can't let that stand. Imagine
that. And then you pick it out,

71
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,330
twist it right there.
Like you're setting this up.

72
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,890
But then you've got these people actually
egging you to take vengeance on the

73
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:14,850
situation,
which is what they're egging him on to do.

74
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,300
Back to the book to be revenged on rivers,
Dorset Gray.

75
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,700
But then, but then here's where, here's
where it takes a little, a little switch.

76
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:28,830
But then I sigh and with
a piece of scripture,

77
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,290
so he's going to say, ah, and then
he's going to quote the Bible.

78
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,233
He says,

79
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,310
he tells them that God bids us
do good for evil. You know, hey,

80
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:45,460
the Bible says we should do good instead
of evil. That's what's going on here.

81
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,590
And then he says,
and thus I clothed my naked villainy.

82
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,120
That's a good line. You kind of be
Shakespeare, right? That one right clove,

83
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:59,330
my naked villainy.
This is how I dress up.

84
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:01,220
My evil plans

85
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,590
with odd old ends stolen out of holy writ.

86
00:06:07,591 --> 00:06:10,080
So He dresses up as naked villain,

87
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:15,081
he covers his evil plans with little
parts of scripture from the Bible.

88
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,940
Then he closes it and seem a
saint when most I play the devil.

89
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,500
So like I said,
that's,

90
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,100
that's Richard the third and things don't
really work out that well in the play

91
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:37,690
for Richard the third and they don't want,

92
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,970
they didn't work out for
him in real life either.

93
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:44,350
He was actually hacked to death,

94
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,500
which we generally consider
to be a bad ending.

95
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:51,760
He was hacked to death at the end of the
battle of Bosworth after he fell off of

96
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:56,110
his horse. Legit. And there's a famous
line, which I'm sure everyone's heard,

97
00:06:56,111 --> 00:07:00,340
a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse,
which is he, he, he was losing everything.

98
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:04,900
Cause it, he fell off his horse
and needed one. And like I said,

99
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:07,780
perhaps at some point we'll,
we'll cover the whole play.

100
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,870
But today what I wanted to dig into a
little bit is this term of Machiavellian.

101
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,340
And we covered his art of war book,

102
00:07:18,341 --> 00:07:21,130
which I had an interesting,
um,

103
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,150
I think it was a youtube comment cause I
said, you know, art of war, Machiavelli,

104
00:07:25,151 --> 00:07:29,320
Niccolo Machiavelli and someone's like
a top was written by Sun Su Idiot.

105
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,280
And then some trooper
came on and was like,

106
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,990
actually he's not talking
about that argue for,

107
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,110
he covered that one here and covered
this. Oh and this, by the way,

108
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:40,810
there's a bunch of different art awards
and here's one of them that was indeed

109
00:07:40,811 --> 00:07:44,200
written by Machiavelli.
So we covered that.

110
00:07:44,201 --> 00:07:47,890
But that's not really a
Machiavelli's most famous work.

111
00:07:47,891 --> 00:07:51,040
His most famous work is this book,
which we mentioned there, the prince

112
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,840
and the prince was thought to
have been written around a 15,

113
00:07:55,841 --> 00:08:00,841
13 not really widely published until
1532 which was five years after

114
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,150
Machiavelli's death.
And it's,

115
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:09,180
it's basically the fore runner
of kind of leadership bunks,

116
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:10,571
right,

117
00:08:10,571 --> 00:08:15,571
is the fore runner of self improvement
books and it's telling leaders how to

118
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:22,690
lead their principalities and it,
and one thing, and I don't dive too,

119
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,740
I don't dive too many of these.
We're not going to cover too many things,

120
00:08:26,741 --> 00:08:28,210
but it gives real world instruction.

121
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:30,430
So it's kind of like extreme ownership
of the dichotomy of leadership.

122
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,830
It gives real situations that happen.

123
00:08:32,831 --> 00:08:35,290
It gives the principal and then it's like
here's a situation where this actually

124
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,710
unfolded this way.
So it's,

125
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:41,711
it's a very thorough in that respect and
it's considered to be one of the first

126
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:48,340
works of modern political philosophy

127
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,010
and it,
this is the thing,

128
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,040
it has the reputation of advising people
to do whatever it takes to gain and

129
00:08:58,261 --> 00:09:03,180
hold power. That's sort of the, that's
when you hear, and in fact the word,

130
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:07,170
like I said, the word has really negative
connotations. When someone says, oh,

131
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:10,430
that guy's, I'm back of alien leader. You
don't think, oh that's, that's cool. No,

132
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,440
you think, oh, he's under handed and he's
going to stab people in the back to get,

133
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,950
get where he wants. And there's
definitely some parts and we'll get to it,

134
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,370
but the,
it's not that,

135
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,940
and the approach is much more
balanced than people than people.

136
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:29,490
Then he has the then then
people generally consider,

137
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:34,200
it's just a much more balanced perspective
and like anything that talks about

138
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:37,440
leadership and human nature,
we can learn from it.

139
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,560
So let's go to the book.

140
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:44,340
The prince by Machiavelli starts off here.

141
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,540
Those who strive to this is, this is
an interesting, he's doing a little,

142
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:52,830
he does some salesy stuff in here too.
There's a couple of times where I have to,

143
00:09:52,831 --> 00:09:54,570
I had to call it, I'm going
to call him out, all of them,

144
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:57,090
but he does some Staley's
salesy type stuff in here.

145
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,950
So here's how he starts it off.

146
00:09:58,951 --> 00:10:02,040
Those who strive to obtain the good
graces of a prince are accustomed to come

147
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:06,240
before him with such things as they hold
most precious on which they see him to

148
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:10,350
take. Most delight whence
one often sees horses, arms,

149
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:12,150
cloth of gold,
precious stones.

150
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:15,420
And similar ornaments presented to
princes worthy of their greatness.

151
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:18,090
So are we saying, hey, if you want to get
good, you know, good graces with a prince,

152
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,150
you bring him stuff,
horses and gold and whatever.

153
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,670
Then he says, desiring therefore to
present myself to your magnificent,

154
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:29,250
with some testimony of
my devotion towards you.

155
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:34,610
I have not found among my possessions
anything which I hold more deer than or

156
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:40,191
value so much as the knowledge of the
actions of great men acquired by long

157
00:10:41,491 --> 00:10:46,320
experience in contemporary affairs
and to continual study of antiquity,

158
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:51,410
which having reflected upon and which
having a reflected upon it with great and

159
00:10:51,841 --> 00:10:52,920
prolonged diligence,

160
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:57,921
I now send digested into a little
volume to your magnificence.

161
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:03,150
That's pretty, that's pretty cool. He
says, look, I, I could give you gold,

162
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,670
but that's not really what's
valuable to me. What I will do,

163
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:08,070
the most valuable thing I can give
you is the knowledge that I have,

164
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,030
the knowledge that I've had from
studying and living through these things.

165
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:13,830
And he continues.

166
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,720
And although I may consider
this work unworthy of your
countenance, nevertheless,

167
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,930
I trust much to you're a benign city,

168
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,300
that it may be acceptable.

169
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,280
Seeing that it is not possible for me
to make a better gift than to offer you

170
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:32,670
the opportunity under of
understanding in the shortest time.

171
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,850
All that I have learnt in so many years
and with so many troubles and dangers,

172
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,030
which work I have not embellished
with swelling or magnificent words,

173
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:44,130
nor stuffed with rounded periods.

174
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,930
So he comes out of the gate,
right?

175
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,570
He's pretty arrogant dude.
These saying, listen,

176
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,850
you are so lucky that I went through all
this stuff and I'm just gonna give it

177
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:57,430
to you. I'm going to give you
this little nice little volume,

178
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:02,560
very plainly written, which is almost like
an excuse, right? Like there's no, no,

179
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:05,830
there's no fancy words here. I'm just
giving it to you straight. You know,

180
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,440
I am no Shakespeare while
Shakespeare wasn't even around yet,

181
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,970
but he's saying it's very plainly
written and then he goes into it.

182
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:17,110
So I think that's a pretty salesy
opening. But Hey, good, good on him.

183
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,190
He's trying to make it happen.

184
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,520
He starts off talking about
the difficulties that it
occur in a new principality

185
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:24,790
and principalities.
You used that word.

186
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,620
That's the what the
what the book is about.

187
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,390
It's when you take over land from people.
Um,

188
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,950
here we go.
Cool.

189
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,830
Although one may be very strong in armed
forces, yet in entering a province,

190
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:42,700
one has always need of the
goodwill of the natives.

191
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,940
That's a great statement and
you think about that statement.

192
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:50,380
Think about it from a
military perspective.

193
00:12:50,381 --> 00:12:51,760
Think about it from a
business perspective,

194
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:56,560
and this is something that
the u s military should
always pay attention to. Hey,

195
00:12:56,561 --> 00:12:59,020
you can be strong in your
armed forces can be strong,

196
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,320
but you need the goodwill of the natives.

197
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:08,800
Boom. There you go. Let's think about,
let's remember that one in the world.

198
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,040
You, you and we, we know
we do our best to do that.

199
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,590
America does its best to do that, but
we don't always do a good job. Hmm.

200
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,140
And then the other thing
is, when you think about it
from a business perspective,

201
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:23,110
when you get an acquisition taking place,
like it's cool,

202
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:25,510
you go in there and you've got all
the money to buy some little company,

203
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,660
but if they all hate you,
nay.

204
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,040
If you don't have the goodwill of
the people that you just bought,

205
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,250
you're going to have some issues. I
promise you you're gonna have some issues.

206
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,143
Yeah.

207
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,423
Okay.

208
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,140
Next up,
those dominions,

209
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,200
which when acquired are added to an
ancient state by him who acquires them are

210
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:47,710
either of the same country and language
or they are not. So he's saying, look,

211
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,850
when you take someone over there,

212
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:52,780
either with the same language
or they don't have the same
language when they are,

213
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:53,860
it is easier to hold them,

214
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,490
especially when they have not been
accustomed to self government.

215
00:13:57,491 --> 00:13:59,950
So if you take someone over and they
speak your language and they've, you know,

216
00:13:59,951 --> 00:14:03,220
you took them over from someone
else that was controlling them,

217
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,400
there'll be okay with that because
they're not used to controlling themselves

218
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:08,800
anyways.
And then he goes on.

219
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,580
But when states acquired in
a country differing language,

220
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,290
customs or laws,

221
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:19,330
there are difficulties and good fortune
and great energy are needed to hold them.

222
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:24,540
And one of the greatest and most real
helps would be that he who has acquired

223
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:29,740
them should go reside there.
So if they don't speak your language,

224
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:31,210
if it's different culture,
guess what?

225
00:14:31,211 --> 00:14:32,860
You got to go there and
you got to stay there.

226
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,130
Otherwise it's going to be a problem.

227
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,680
So they're going to move there to
so they can gain more understanding,

228
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,440
gain more understanding and learn
the language and stuff like that.

229
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,570
And also be there because you've gotta,

230
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,080
you gotta be able to pay attention to when
rebellion is going to form against it.

231
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,060
If you're not,
and they speak a different language,

232
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,250
they have a different culture
and you're not in the game blind.

233
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,430
So has some issues. Yeah,
you're going to get blindsided.

234
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:04,160
So you've got to go in there, got to get
deep. You got to occupy that territory.

235
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,273
Hmm.

236
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,850
Continuing on men,
odd either to be well treated or crushed.

237
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,110
We read that one again.

238
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:19,510
Men ought either B to be well treated
or crushed because they can avenge

239
00:15:19,511 --> 00:15:24,300
themselves of lighter
injuries of more serious ones.

240
00:15:24,301 --> 00:15:25,860
They cannot,
therefore,

241
00:15:25,861 --> 00:15:29,130
the injury that is to be done to
a man ought to be of such kind.

242
00:15:29,131 --> 00:15:33,150
That one does not stand
in fear of revenge.

243
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,500
So there's kind of classic
Mackey of alien fought.

244
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,080
If you're going to hurt someone,

245
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,760
just completely annihilate them
to the best of your ability.

246
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,690
Don't give them the ability to
come back at you again. Yeah.

247
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,170
And then on the other hand, treat
them super good. Right. So the Tia,

248
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:58,110
treat her, treat them good,
or you crush them. Yeah.

249
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,143
It's,

250
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,880
it's, it's a, it's a good statement,
right? Yeah. And it takes,

251
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,760
this is something that it
takes, uh, uh, you know,

252
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:11,640
the will to completely destroy someone.

253
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,650
It takes a lot of gall, right. You have
to have the stomach to be able to do that.

254
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,140
Yeah. And a lot of people don't
have the stomach to do that.

255
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,990
So that's why I would say in most cases
it's better to treat people well and

256
00:16:24,991 --> 00:16:27,360
have them come on board. And he
had actually, he says that too,

257
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,670
but we'll get there.
And back to the book,

258
00:16:29,671 --> 00:16:34,380
in maintaining armed men
there in place of colonies,

259
00:16:34,381 --> 00:16:39,180
one spends much more having
to consume on the garrison,

260
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:42,960
all of the income from the state so that
the whole acquisition turns into a loss

261
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,590
and many more are exasperated
because the whole state is injured.

262
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:47,941
That's what he's saying.

263
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:50,730
So when you do have to go in and you'd
have to smash it and you have to keep

264
00:16:50,731 --> 00:16:53,850
people there to keep smashing, guess
what? You're spending all this money,

265
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:59,450
you're investing all these people and
it's so hard to keep it under control that

266
00:17:00,691 --> 00:17:04,620
it's not even worth it made the
acquisition turns into a loss.

267
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:09,360
So from a, from a business
perspective, you go into a company,

268
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:13,020
you buy them, but then they're rebellious.
So you've got to fire everyone.

269
00:17:13,021 --> 00:17:15,150
They've got to bring people in and
retrain them and you've got to retake

270
00:17:15,151 --> 00:17:15,530
territory.

271
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:19,710
You lost customers because you cause you
didn't support during that time and so

272
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:23,010
you invest all this money and guess
what your acquisition ends up becoming a

273
00:17:23,011 --> 00:17:23,844
loss.

274
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,180
Whereas if you had a good relationship
with these people and you went in there

275
00:17:27,181 --> 00:17:27,331
and you,

276
00:17:27,331 --> 00:17:29,730
they were able to kind of come on board
with your culture and the way you were

277
00:17:29,731 --> 00:17:32,210
doing things, all of a sudden you
move into a good scenario. Yeah,

278
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,560
keep it in. Keep, keep it. Okay.

279
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,360
Friendly.
If you can

280
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:44,540
back to the book what all
prudent Prince's ought to do,

281
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:50,020
who have to regard not only
present troubles but also
future for which they must

282
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:55,701
prepare with every energy because when
foreseen it is easy to remedy them,

283
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,940
but if you wait until they approach the
medicine is no longer in time because

284
00:18:02,941 --> 00:18:05,220
the maladies become incurable.

285
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,030
There some good stuff in this
book and this is one of them.

286
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,390
This is kind of obvious,
but hey,

287
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,450
you need to look to the future
and when there's a problem coming,

288
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,230
cut it off early. The earlier you solve
the problem, the easier it's going to be.

289
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,560
He continues for,
it happens in this,

290
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,460
as the physicians say it
happens in hectic fever.

291
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,660
Then in the beginning of the
malady it is easy to cure,

292
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:35,010
but difficult to detect.
But in the course of time,

293
00:18:35,011 --> 00:18:38,010
not having been either detected
or treating an in the beginning,

294
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,270
it becomes easy to detect,
but difficult to cure.

295
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,400
It's like getting caught in our mock,
right? If you see it coming, it's easy.

296
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,400
You just move your shoulder, you move your
hips a little bit, whatever you're out.

297
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:53,550
Yeah.
The further it goes down that path,

298
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,290
the worse the situation gets.
Yes, and it's the same thing also,

299
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,380
you know when I've talked about
having hard conversations with people,

300
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,750
the earlier you have
that hard conversation,

301
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,350
the easier the hard conversation is
to have. The longer you let it go.

302
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,180
Not only is it a harder conversation,

303
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:12,180
but it's a conversation that's going
to disrupt and cause more problems.

304
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,390
It's going to interfere with
our relationship. If, if I'm,

305
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,770
if I have to have a hard
conversation with you,

306
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:19,110
are really are our relationship
and isn't getting better, right?

307
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:24,210
It's getting worse. So the ease, the
earlier you could solve these problems,

308
00:19:24,211 --> 00:19:26,490
the better off you're going to be.
It continues this,

309
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,520
it happens in affairs of state for when
the evils that arise have been foreseen,

310
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:37,170
which it is only given to a wise man
to see. They can be quickly redressed,

311
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,890
but when through not having been foreseen,

312
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:45,030
they have been permitted to grow in
a way that everyone can see them.

313
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,010
There is no longer a remedy.

314
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,370
Keep your ears to the ground so you've
got to hear what's coming. Therefore,

315
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,400
the Romans for seeing troubles dealt
with them at once and even to avoid a war

316
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,020
would not let them come to a head for,

317
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:03,630
they knew that war is not to be avoided,

318
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,260
but is only to be put off
to the advantage of others.

319
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,250
So every time you delay in
getting that problem solved,

320
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:14,850
you're not helping yourself. Hmm.
That's a good way to think about that.

321
00:20:14,851 --> 00:20:16,830
I haven't really thought about
that way before. You know, I,

322
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,380
I talk about the hard conversations have
earlier. They're going to be easier.

323
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:23,550
The only,
if you're putting those those wars off,

324
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,900
you're only helping the other person.

325
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,540
You're always putting yourself
in a worse situation. Okay.

326
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:31,500
So the other person meaning the enemy.
Yeah. Yeah. You're only helping the enemy.

327
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,063
Hm.

328
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,750
So attack those problems. Look, well, I
think the first thing is pay attention,

329
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,111
right?

330
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:43,170
You've got to pay attention to these
problems that could be arising hard to

331
00:20:43,171 --> 00:20:45,840
detect,
hard to you and yeah,

332
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,820
and then I like he says it when everyone
can see them, it's too late. Yeah.

333
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,080
So you gotta be gathering intelligence.
You gotta be paying attention

334
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:59,920
back to the book because one can easily
entered there by gaining over some

335
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:04,921
barren of the kingdom for one always
finds malcontents and such as desire a

336
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:08,440
change. So he's talking about
when you're taking someone,

337
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:11,640
when you're taking over like a kingdom,
you,

338
00:21:11,641 --> 00:21:15,340
you can always find some people in the
kingdom that are of not happy with the

339
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:19,510
situation. Like you can go into a company
and you can say, it seems like your,

340
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,420
the way your processes work
is a real hard on you guys.

341
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,040
It seems like they're not really in vet.

342
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,650
You can always find some people
that are mad inside of a kingdom.

343
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,820
That's what he's saying. He's saying
to find them. Yeah, he, well, he,

344
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,930
here's what he goes on.

345
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:36,550
He says such men for the reasons given
can open the way into a state and render

346
00:21:36,551 --> 00:21:41,350
victory easy.
But if you wish to hold it afterwards,

347
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,900
you meet with infinite difficulties,

348
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,830
both from those you have assisted
and those you have crushed.

349
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,060
Nor is it enough for you
to have exterminated the
family of the prints because

350
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:56,740
the Lord's that remain make themselves
the heads of fresh movements against you.

351
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,120
And as you are unable to either
satisfy or exterminate them,

352
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:04,690
the state is lost whenever the
time brings the opportunity.

353
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,020
What you're dealing with there,
if you're entering,

354
00:22:08,021 --> 00:22:10,780
if you find some people that are disloyal
inside of a company and then you go

355
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:14,380
and become friends with them and then
you go in and take the company over,

356
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,380
there is a chance. And what he's
saying is like that disloyalty is,

357
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:24,340
is a trait and they're going
to be disloyal to you. So
you need to, and you can't,

358
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:29,030
you can't crush them.
You can't exterminate them because the,

359
00:22:29,031 --> 00:22:34,031
you've developed a relationship with
them and at the same time you can't trust

360
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:38,710
them.
So be careful with that.

361
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:41,771
Back to the book,

362
00:22:41,771 --> 00:22:46,120
whenever those states which have been
oc had been acquired as stated above,

363
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:49,810
have been accustomed to live under
their own laws and in freedom,

364
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,070
there are three courses for
those who wished to hold them.

365
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:57,400
So obviously I'm skipping
big chunks of the book, but

366
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:03,670
what he's talking about is when you've
taken over somewhere that is used to

367
00:23:03,671 --> 00:23:07,810
having their own laws and used to living
in freedom, there's three different,

368
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:12,870
three different methods or approaches you
can take if you want to hang onto him.

369
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,110
Here we go.
The first is to ruin them.

370
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,110
The next is to reside there in person.

371
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,510
The third is to permit them
to live under their own laws,

372
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:32,980
drawing attribute and establishing
within it an oligarchy which will keep it

373
00:23:32,981 --> 00:23:37,360
friendly to you. Very clever, very clever,

374
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,510
very smart too. And I see the, again,

375
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:44,230
I keep going back to business
a lot because when you,

376
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,090
when you're dealing with a company
that acquires other companies,

377
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,520
like this is very real. If you've
got a company, let's say you acquire,

378
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,600
if you acquire part of,

379
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:57,750
let's say you acquire part of a
company that's been run by some, uh,

380
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,530
senior company,
like a parent company,

381
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,590
they're not used to making
their own decisions. So when
you come in and say, Hey,

382
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:05,330
now we're not going to help you
out and we're gonna, you know,

383
00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:08,870
you're going to be kind of going along
with us. Now you're under our command.

384
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,840
If they're used to being commanded,
they're like, okay, new boss,

385
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:15,140
but we will deal with it. But
if they're, if they've been,

386
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,840
if they were their own company,
they were,

387
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,300
they were on their own and they were
doing whatever they wanted and they were

388
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:23,570
living in total freedom and now you come
in and see you and now you got start

389
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:26,760
listening to my rules. Yeah.
It's going to be a problem. Yes.

390
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,600
I don't agree with the fact
that you have to crush them.

391
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,660
I would prefer that you go in
and form a relationship with him.

392
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,910
But what he's saying is,
look, if you go in there,

393
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,470
so let's Say I took over echoes company
and you are used to freedom and I was

394
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:42,740
just like, hey echo, here's what's going
on. Hey, here's some broad guidance,

395
00:24:42,741 --> 00:24:45,920
but I really like what you're doing.
Keep doing it, man. Keep doing it.

396
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,581
And then you know,

397
00:24:46,581 --> 00:24:48,380
here's what you're gonna pay me
because I'm giving you some support.

398
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,010
And you'd be like, okay.
Now what I will say,

399
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:56,960
which he doesn't go into is over time
I can start to get, first of all,

400
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:59,660
build a relationship with you.
Once I build a relationship with you,

401
00:24:59,661 --> 00:25:00,770
then I can start saying, hey, echo,

402
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:03,350
have you thought about doing this a little
bit different over here and hey, echo,

403
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,580
what do you about this? And Hey, echo,

404
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:07,430
this other company that we own does
it this way and it's really efficient.

405
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,200
Would you consider maybe seeing how that
would work inside your, with your team?

406
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,520
Yeah. And so I would slowly move, but
for me to come in and say, okay, Aca,

407
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:21,020
we just closed the deal. Here's the
new yes, that's when you go, hey,

408
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,100
you go to your troops and see,

409
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:24,710
I don't know if this was a good call
and I don't know what these guys think.

410
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,560
They know everything. And now listen,
we got a rebellion on our hands.

411
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,340
So now I might have to crush it.
My credit,

412
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:36,350
the whole idea of crushing seems pretty
old school. Yeah, yeah. Well, and,

413
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:39,830
and as he said,
when once you crush something,

414
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,370
well then you've got to invest all
kinds of things in it too. Like, Hey,

415
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,150
so let's say, let's say I bought
your company and then you, you know,

416
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,940
you rebelled against me, so I fired you.
Well now I've got to bring someone on.

417
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,510
I've got to find someone that understands
your business and the intricacies of

418
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:54,500
your business. And guess what?
That's not easy. And it, guess what?

419
00:25:54,501 --> 00:25:57,080
Now I've got to invest all this time
and myself and I've got to bring some,

420
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,830
some contractors in there to help out.
Um, next thing you know, I'm upside down.

421
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,700
Whereas if I had just done a
good deal with you and you know,

422
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:08,180
kind of let you run things for awhile
and let build a relationship so that you

423
00:26:08,181 --> 00:26:12,260
actually would want to listen
to me, that's different.
That's better. Yeah. So yes,

424
00:26:12,261 --> 00:26:17,220
the idea of crushing people,
generally it's your, it's,

425
00:26:17,221 --> 00:26:22,100
it's not the preferred method. It's not
ideal. Generally. Sometimes is required.

426
00:26:22,101 --> 00:26:25,700
Yes. Sometimes people need to get
destroyed. That's, that's the way it is.

427
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:29,680
And when that's the way, cool.
That's a lock and load destroyed.

428
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,140
Did you used to watch football
or do you watch football?

429
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:37,420
I don't watch much football. Ronnie
Lott is, he's old school. Yes I do.

430
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:42,590
A lot. Is 40 niners packaged then? I
Dunno if this is true, but it's a rumor.

431
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,980
I Dunno.
This is what I heard when I was

432
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,240
young, where he would like, he broke
his finger, pinky or I don't know,

433
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:52,050
one of his fingers. He broke it. And you
know, he's trying to, you know, play,

434
00:26:52,051 --> 00:26:53,590
you gotta play as a
professional football player,

435
00:26:53,591 --> 00:26:55,660
so you can't just be out because
of your finger. So he play,

436
00:26:55,661 --> 00:27:00,000
you tape it up and it kept just getting
jammed up so he just cut it off.

437
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,540
So it's kind of one of those deals,
you know where you know,

438
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:07,740
yeah get rid of the finger but you don't
have a finger. But if the thing is like,

439
00:27:07,741 --> 00:27:11,610
you know, jamming you up too much by
being there, then you got to crush it.

440
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,370
I heard a story,
similar story about village

441
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:21,030
village Ismail do you know crazy
Jujitsu player. Great Jujitsu player.

442
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,310
But he had crazy a cauliflower ears.
Yeah.

443
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,600
They just look like to bring to the half
tennis half baseball's on either side

444
00:27:30,121 --> 00:27:30,954
of his head.

445
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,770
And I heard a story about him that he
was just asking the doctor just caught

446
00:27:34,771 --> 00:27:37,920
them off, cut off, cut them off,
just get rid of them. No use.

447
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,310
All they do is causing me problems.
Just get rid of them. Yeah.

448
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,770
So is that considered a
hardcore kind of yeah,

449
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:49,440
cause I'm sure that, well then again I
guess it depends on the problems, right?

450
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:53,340
I mean cause that's, what are
your ears do for you? And I guess,

451
00:27:53,341 --> 00:27:56,780
I guess they catch some sound
and bring it into your ears. Yes.

452
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:01,970
But if you're not hunting right and you
don't necessarily need to hear super

453
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:04,471
well,
and by the way,

454
00:28:04,471 --> 00:28:07,650
once you have calling photos and it
starts going into your ear a little bit,

455
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:12,030
that's not good either for your, for your
hearing. So his hearing might improve.

456
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:14,990
Just get rid of those things. Yeah.
I guess it depends how bad is coming.

457
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,490
You know what I'm saying? I didn't know
what you're saying. Yeah. You know,

458
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:24,060
cutting off your years, it's a lot
more that goes into that then a finger,

459
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:27,570
I think, because you know, I don't know.
I mean on a social level, you know,

460
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:30,840
you get a guy who was, his ears cut off
on purpose, by the way. It's kind of like,

461
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,580
okay,
let's say you're a girl and you're like,

462
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:37,260
Hey mom, dad, boyfriend.

463
00:28:37,261 --> 00:28:41,090
Have you never thought about like when if
you've read a cauliflower ear? No. Okay.

464
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,700
Sometimes when you get cauliflower ear
and it's preventing you from trading,

465
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,670
there's, there's no doubt that the
thought goes through your mind like,

466
00:28:47,671 --> 00:28:50,520
you know what? Hey, I'm
in the game. You know,

467
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:53,850
these things aren't doing me much good.
Let me just get rid of these. Yes,

468
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:58,710
I could see how that could be, I guess,
but sorry man, I can't get there.

469
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:03,750
Not with the ears. Maybe the fingers. I
dig the fingers for sure. So you can't,

470
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,930
there's certain things you can't do if
you lose your fingers. I he play guitar.

471
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:09,180
Yeah. You're going to be a
problem in gym. So I keep,

472
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:14,070
I keep the fingers more than the ears.
The choice.

473
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,310
Here's your fingers. I don't
mind. You know what, you're,

474
00:29:18,311 --> 00:29:23,070
you're more sensitive to your appearance
I think than I am aesthetically

475
00:29:23,071 --> 00:29:27,730
conscious. Yeah, I would agree
with that, sir. Yes, I think so.

476
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,200
So you get your ears. I'm
keeping my fingers. Yes.

477
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,970
Like a hammer on that gift box deal.

478
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:39,870
Well that went off the rails a little bit.
All right.

479
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:40,950
Going back to the,

480
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:46,860
a wise man ought always to follow the
paths beaten by great men and to imitate

481
00:29:47,771 --> 00:29:52,420
those who have been supreme so that
if his ability to does not equal,

482
00:29:52,421 --> 00:29:55,330
there's at least it will savor of it.

483
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:00,940
Let him act like the clever archers who,
this is a good little statement,

484
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,680
let him act like the clever archers
who designed to hit the mark,

485
00:30:05,681 --> 00:30:07,900
which yet appears too far distant.

486
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:13,140
And knowing the limits to
which the strength of their
bow attains tank take aim

487
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,370
much higher than the mark.

488
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,510
Not to reach them by their strengths
or Arrow to so great a height,

489
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,840
but to be able to with the aid of so
high and aim hit the mark they which they

490
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:31,360
wish to reach. That's a very clever
way of putting it. Yeah. Hey look,

491
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,340
if I don't think I can hit this mark,

492
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,420
I'm just going to aim a little bit higher
and then even though I might not reach

493
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:40,450
the highest mark, I'll at
least hit the mark. I was,

494
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,780
I'll get where I want to
be and yeah. Yeah. Fully.

495
00:30:43,781 --> 00:30:47,530
That's a good way to go
through life. Yeah. There's
a lot of that. I mean that's,

496
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,050
you know, that's a tactic, technique,

497
00:30:50,051 --> 00:30:54,190
whatever and like a lot of things like
negotiation and they say they'd do the

498
00:30:54,191 --> 00:30:58,000
same thing. Right. Okay. I
want to get, you know, I don't
know, you go job interview,

499
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:58,810
whatever.

500
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:02,620
I want to make 100,000 so I'm going
to ask for like one 20 he's going to

501
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:07,000
negotiate it down and I get my hundred.
No, that's true. Where this thing,

502
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:11,860
I think sometimes people get this
out of hand is it'll be like a sales

503
00:31:11,861 --> 00:31:16,030
organization and they'll say,
you know, they want to bring in,

504
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:21,280
they want to do $5 million worth of
sales in the next month. And so they say,

505
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,200
okay guys,
this is what we're gonna do 10 million.

506
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,270
And they set an unrealistic goal.

507
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:28,150
When you set an unrealistic
goal that's not achievable.

508
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,730
It's basically a meaningless goal.
So you have to,

509
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:34,790
you have to aim a little bit high,
but it's gotta be realistic. Yeah.

510
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,520
Yeah.
I would think you knew,

511
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:40,720
I'm just going off how I felt
right there when you said that, uh,

512
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:44,890
if someone sets an unrealistic goal,
especially for you, that includes you,

513
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,813
you know,

514
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:50,620
where like the failure of reaching
that goal is kind of partly or failure.

515
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,810
I think you'd kind of decrease
my enthusiasm for those deals to,

516
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,920
that's why people need to be very
careful in how they set their goals,

517
00:31:59,921 --> 00:32:03,010
that they set them high
enough that it, it, it,

518
00:32:03,011 --> 00:32:07,060
you try and get to it and maybe you don't
quite get there because let's face it,

519
00:32:07,061 --> 00:32:08,740
if you set a goal and
you just easily make it,

520
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,840
you should have set your goal
a little bit higher. You know,

521
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,740
if you set a goal and is not even
close, no one even tries. Yeah.

522
00:32:15,741 --> 00:32:20,470
So you've got to set a realistic goal.
Yeah. Yeah. It was not going to work well.

523
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:21,280
Yeah.

524
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,900
And like people will be
like salt especially at work
when people start setting

525
00:32:25,901 --> 00:32:30,010
goals all crazy like crazy. That's
what I was talking to me. Yeah.

526
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,960
Well I was just watching the movie
major league. Remember that on the old,

527
00:32:34,961 --> 00:32:37,690
the first one I tried to remember
what it was about and they were like,

528
00:32:37,691 --> 00:32:40,000
baseball is this where they,

529
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:43,790
the owner was trying to like
sell the team or something.

530
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:48,740
But for her to do that they had to like
lose a games or something like that.

531
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,000
And if they didn't lose in,

532
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:53,220
she would just replace the players with
other players who would lose, you know,

533
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,950
kind of thing.
So it was a,

534
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:58,640
so everyone knows all down about
it in the garbage truck. Well,

535
00:32:58,641 --> 00:33:01,910
there's only one thing to do when the
whole thing, you know, like that, right,

536
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:06,770
which is, I dig it. Right.
Um, but at like a regular job,

537
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,530
well,
it was for the movie to obviously,

538
00:33:08,531 --> 00:33:12,770
so you've got to tap in
inspirational storyline. But
anyway, at your job, you know,

539
00:33:12,771 --> 00:33:16,280
let's say there's numbers week
and then it's like, okay, Dang,

540
00:33:16,281 --> 00:33:19,340
you're making me meet these crazy numbers.
And they're unrealistic.

541
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:23,060
They're above a normal good goal.
They're way above. So it's like, okay,

542
00:33:23,061 --> 00:33:25,970
what does this mean now? Now like probably
get, can't spend time with my family.

543
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,301
Okay,

544
00:33:26,301 --> 00:33:29,840
now you're going to freaking dryness
into the ground working and do all this

545
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:33,980
stuff or whatever. Going against my
interests, you know, as a human being.

546
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,400
So I'm gonna feel junk about that. I'm
not going to like that. No, no one does.

547
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,061
That's my point.

548
00:33:38,061 --> 00:33:41,700
Does even no one likes in the
business world and no one liked it.

549
00:33:41,701 --> 00:33:44,870
It made your leisure either
as well. That was, you know,

550
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,840
they did like it. Check.
All right, moving on.

551
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:54,430
Now as the fact of becoming a prince
from private station presupposes either

552
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:59,150
ability or fortunate and he uses the f
word fortunate lot to mean like pretty

553
00:33:59,151 --> 00:33:59,984
much luck.

554
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:06,070
It is clear that one or the other of
these things will mitigate in some degree

555
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:08,750
many difficulties.
Nevertheless,

556
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:13,280
he was relied least on fortune
is established the strongest.

557
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:17,150
Make sense? So when you, when you're in a
leadership position, if you've got there,

558
00:34:17,151 --> 00:34:17,990
cause you're lucky,

559
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:21,500
it's going to be harder for you to
maintain a good position as a leader.

560
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,040
You've got there because of
your skill and what does it,

561
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:26,240
what's the other thing he says?
Because your ability, if you get there,

562
00:34:26,241 --> 00:34:28,970
cause your ability, people are
gonna respect you more. It just,

563
00:34:28,971 --> 00:34:30,410
you just got there by luck.

564
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:37,190
Those who buy valorous ways become
princes acquire a principality with

565
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,460
difficulty,
but they keep it with ease.

566
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,890
The difficulties they have in acquiring
it rise in part from the new rules.

567
00:34:45,891 --> 00:34:47,210
And method methods,

568
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:51,020
which they are forced to introduce
to establish their government and its

569
00:34:51,021 --> 00:34:51,830
security.

570
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:55,730
So when you have a hard time getting
into power and you do it by boldness,

571
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:56,690
once you're there,

572
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:59,510
it's going to be easier for you to do
it because you had to make all these

573
00:34:59,511 --> 00:35:03,890
maneuvers. You're to figure things
out in order to get their continuing,

574
00:35:03,891 --> 00:35:07,070
and it ought to be remembered that
there is nothing more difficult.

575
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,550
This is a good one. There is nothing
more difficult to take in hand,

576
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:15,670
more perilous to conduct or more uncertain
in its success than to take the lead

577
00:35:16,431 --> 00:35:19,430
in the introduction of
a new order of things.

578
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,900
So there's nothing harder than trying
to come in and introduce a new order of

579
00:35:23,901 --> 00:35:26,030
things. Nothing harder than
that. And here's the reasons,

580
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,940
because the innovator has for enemies,

581
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:34,510
all those who have done well under the
old conditions and Luke warm defenders in

582
00:35:36,231 --> 00:35:39,270
those who may do well under the new.

583
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,400
So you got people that are
entrenched that like, hey man,

584
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:43,080
we've been doing this for 20 years.
I'm not changing it.

585
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,290
And he got someone else saying, well
it could work better. That's like,

586
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:50,760
it's not a good comparison. It's
not a, it's not a fair fight. Yeah.

587
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:53,960
Cause those people that are already
know it works. They know it works. Yeah.

588
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,960
You got someone that I think the new
thing will work. It's a mismatch.

589
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,751
Continuing on.

590
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:05,751
This coolness arises partly from fear
of the opponents who have the laws on

591
00:36:05,971 --> 00:36:10,971
their side and partly from the incredulous
incredulous of men who do not readily

592
00:36:13,621 --> 00:36:18,621
believe in new things until they
have had long experience of them.

593
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,800
So you got people that have been
doing this forever. Like I just said,

594
00:36:22,801 --> 00:36:25,850
you've got someone that's hasn't really
figured out if there's new things going

595
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,320
to work and it's just a mismatch.
So

596
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:31,530
they're skeptical.

597
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,873
Okay.

598
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:40,900
Continuing those who solely by good
fortune become princes from being private

599
00:36:41,271 --> 00:36:46,271
citizens have little trouble in rising
but much trouble in keeping a top.

600
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:51,710
They have not had any d any difficulties
on the way up because they fly.

601
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:55,610
But they have many, when they reached
the summit, this is a good one.

602
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:01,340
The people that kind of get lucky and
ended up in a, in a senior position,

603
00:37:01,341 --> 00:37:04,700
in a leadership position, they got lucky.
And so there's no trouble getting there.

604
00:37:04,701 --> 00:37:07,100
They got lucky. They flew there. Yeah.

605
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,670
But then he says they have trouble when
they reached the summit. Continue on.

606
00:37:10,671 --> 00:37:15,190
Such are those to whom some state is
given either for money or by favor of him,

607
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,940
of Him who bestows it.
So

608
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:20,621
you know,

609
00:37:20,621 --> 00:37:25,240
you see this going through buds actually
there's some people that were like

610
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:30,270
incredible athletes and they never failed
anything before in their life and all

611
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:34,200
of a sudden they show up and they start
failing things and it breaks them. Yeah.

612
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,580
Or they're great athletes
going through buds.

613
00:37:36,581 --> 00:37:40,120
And it's because if you're a great
athlete, will and buds is kind of easy.

614
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:41,710
And then you show up at a seal team.

615
00:37:41,711 --> 00:37:44,800
Things aren't easy because it's not just
athletics in the seal teams and it's

616
00:37:44,801 --> 00:37:47,650
not an athletic game. And the
Sealer, as a matter of fact,

617
00:37:47,651 --> 00:37:49,630
I was just talking about
this the other day,

618
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,280
the athletic capability of,

619
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,400
of a seal or have a special
operations. It's like, sure,

620
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:58,570
you get some great athletes in there,

621
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:03,520
but you put on a rucksack and Hump,
you know,

622
00:38:03,521 --> 00:38:07,680
10 kilometers, that's not
an athletically gifted. You,

623
00:38:07,681 --> 00:38:12,230
you as an athletic, there's not
an athletic skill test. Yeah.

624
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:16,360
You know, it's, it's not like, yeah,
you gotta be in good shape for sure.

625
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:21,930
But whether this guy played college
football and this guy didn't,

626
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,980
where you put on that rucksack and start
start humping, you can't tell who's who.

627
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,870
Yeah. You know, occasionally you
might be able to, you got to you,

628
00:38:30,871 --> 00:38:33,190
you can make some assumptions that
the have to get the a football player,

629
00:38:33,191 --> 00:38:33,371
you know,

630
00:38:33,371 --> 00:38:38,290
he's an athletic person but
it's not an athletic game.

631
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,830
Yeah. The uh, the same
with like shooting. Okay.

632
00:38:41,831 --> 00:38:43,780
You get someone that's got
great hand eye coordination,

633
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,290
they're probably going to be a pretty
good shot. Not necessarily though.

634
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:51,000
I knew some guys that were great
athletes weren't good shots. Yeah.

635
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,850
And vice versa. Newsome guys that were
great athletes and they were great shots.

636
00:38:54,851 --> 00:38:58,510
They'd great hand eye coordination.
So it's not really,

637
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,430
there's not really this
athletic challenge.

638
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:05,490
So my point is you get someone that's
sales through buds because they're a great

639
00:39:05,831 --> 00:39:09,340
athlete cause cause buds is more of
an athletic pursuit. I mean it's like,

640
00:39:09,341 --> 00:39:12,460
okay you gotta run, you got to do pull,
you got to do the opposite course.

641
00:39:12,461 --> 00:39:15,100
There's more athleticism
involved in getting through buds.

642
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:18,040
Once you get through buds then it's like,

643
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:22,960
oh you have to think and you have to
gut through hard things a while you're

644
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:25,720
thinking. So there's some
guys that I went through with,

645
00:39:25,721 --> 00:39:27,520
it got a little tripped up
when they got to the teams,

646
00:39:27,521 --> 00:39:30,160
even though they did not have
a hard time at all with buds,

647
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:35,680
they got to the teams, they get
tripped up on things because they just,

648
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:39,970
they just kind of gotten their own way.
You know? Unfortunately. Good, good guys,

649
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:41,890
hard guys.
But you just think man,

650
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:47,010
just you need to think a little bit
more dealing with certain mental anguish

651
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:53,090
while you do other things.
Dealing with it. Yeah,

652
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,720
you got to make decisions
when you're tired,

653
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,760
you got to stay awake when you're tired.
You got to, yeah, like all those things.

654
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:03,250
Oh there's stress going on. And
you're freaking out. Well, guess what?

655
00:40:03,251 --> 00:40:06,130
You still got to decide that you've got
to make something happen and you've got

656
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:10,480
to go do it. Yeah. Where it's
easy to just go curl up in a ball,

657
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,350
take a nap. Yeah. Yeah.

658
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,770
Continuing such and he's talking about
these people that were kind of given luck

659
00:40:20,771 --> 00:40:22,250
or or bought their way into the position.

660
00:40:22,251 --> 00:40:26,230
Such stand simply elevated upon the
goodwill and the fortune of him who has

661
00:40:26,231 --> 00:40:31,231
elevated them to most
inconsistent and unstable things.

662
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:36,820
Neither have they the knowledge requisite
for the position because unless they

663
00:40:36,821 --> 00:40:39,880
are men of great worth and ability
does not reasonable to expect that they

664
00:40:39,881 --> 00:40:42,940
should know how to command.
Having always lived in private condition.

665
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,410
So you get somebody
that gets thrown into a,

666
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:47,230
to a leadership position and they haven't
done anything to earn their position

667
00:40:47,231 --> 00:40:49,610
here. They're going to be an experience
going to be hard for him. Yeah.

668
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:53,890
Same thing with the, I mean you
maybe see it now, maybe you don't,

669
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,660
but are injured you to where you know the,
you know,

670
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:59,110
a young guy or whatever,

671
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:04,070
he'll, he'll, or he'll have a certain
body type or audit or whatever.

672
00:41:04,071 --> 00:41:08,600
He'll develop like this certain move
that'll be kind of new to everyone.

673
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:12,770
Like no one's ever seen these,
this system or this new move or whatever.

674
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:17,950
And they'll get guys get guys in and
win tournaments and start winning

675
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:21,410
tournaments and the instructor's
like, Dang, this guy's
killing these tournaments.

676
00:41:21,411 --> 00:41:24,110
Hey, let's give him his blue belt,
Brown belt. You know, all the way up.

677
00:41:24,111 --> 00:41:25,190
He gets his like brown belt,

678
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:30,191
black belt because he wins tournament
more so then because of like his whole

679
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:34,010
rounded skill set and knowledge.
So kind of makes

680
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,470
sense. Right? I mean shoot,
if a man, if he's willing,

681
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,550
if he's tapping everyone out
in the tournament in, you
know, all the lower belts,

682
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:45,310
of course we can get you to spell it.
Makes Sense. But later on, you know,

683
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,920
as time goes on and one of
the things it's like, okay,

684
00:41:48,921 --> 00:41:51,830
they'll just figure out the move,
figured out that the answer to that move,

685
00:41:51,831 --> 00:41:54,520
what else is left?
Nothing crazy.

686
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,990
That if you know the move,
like isn't it crazy and you first of all,

687
00:41:58,991 --> 00:42:01,580
but if you don't how to defend something,
you can stop. If you don't know it,

688
00:42:01,581 --> 00:42:05,740
you get tapped. If you know it, you can
get out. Yes. That's so crazy. Yeah. And,

689
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,070
and what's really crazy
is that's the way life is.

690
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:11,480
That's the way leadership is.

691
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,970
Like when I talked to companies and I'll
be talking to some leader and I'm like,

692
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:17,150
Hey, here's what you need to say
in a situation like this. And it's,

693
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:21,020
it's like they can now escape
this position that they're
in. Yes. Cause they can,

694
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:26,180
oh, oh yeah, here's what you
should say. Yeah. And they say, ah,

695
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:30,290
you can see it. Look in their eyes.
And then they'll call me and say, dude,

696
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:35,620
I did that team turned
around and said, oh yeah.

697
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:38,240
Big shocker man.
There's moves that you can make.

698
00:42:38,241 --> 00:42:42,440
There's tactical maneuvers that you can
make and if you know them, you will,

699
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:47,060
you'll escape the position. If you don't
know them, you'll get destroyed. Yeah.

700
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,131
And so to,

701
00:42:48,131 --> 00:42:50,960
to where you're going with
this is sometimes somebody
develops something where

702
00:42:50,961 --> 00:42:55,040
they get really good at something and
as soon as soon as some people know it's

703
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:56,040
coming,
you know,

704
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:58,730
they can just stop it and then all of
a sudden they start losing tournaments.

705
00:42:58,731 --> 00:42:59,511
They get to purple belt,

706
00:42:59,511 --> 00:43:02,220
they start losing journalists because
of how I was going to say, see,

707
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,010
it's unrealistic in my opinion,

708
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:09,320
that someone would be really good at a
move and go all the way to black belt

709
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:12,860
based on that move. That's not realistic.
Yeah. They'll get somebody will,

710
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,130
people will figure it out and they'll
have to round out their game before they

711
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:20,750
get brown belt. Black belt. You were
getting a little crazy there. Yeah, no,

712
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,960
for the example. But there is this
one, and I don't know the girl's name,

713
00:43:23,961 --> 00:43:28,730
but it was um, it was, I dunno, like I
was saying, but she was a brown belt,

714
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:32,400
but she had been a brown belt. Like
she, it took her like two years or so.

715
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:37,150
It's something super fast to get to
Brown. We get to brown belt because of, I,

716
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:40,610
if I'm not mistaken, she would do
like a reverse triangle all the time.

717
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:44,760
Maybe a regular triangle. I'm not
sure. And then um, I dunno then I think

718
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:48,020
I could be getting the names wrong,

719
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,370
but I think it was penny Thomas and she
ended up fighting for Bennie Thompson.

720
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:55,430
Bennie Thompson beat her and you
know, you know, the new hotness,

721
00:43:55,431 --> 00:43:57,680
the new girl coming up or whatever.
And um,

722
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:02,710
I think it was Joel who mentioned like
this exact thing that he's talking about

723
00:44:03,771 --> 00:44:08,120
where it's like, yeah, like to be a real
brown belt and compete at the top level,

724
00:44:08,121 --> 00:44:11,900
you got to have a well rounded
game essentially. You know,
because you can't just,

725
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:13,460
you can't just like what you said,

726
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:17,420
like you make it up the Brown and black
for a reason. Brown and black belt.

727
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:20,350
You can't just do it with one move
cause that's not what a brown belt.

728
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:23,330
And that's when you get
someone that's really good.

729
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,970
They know about all the
different moves. You know, it's,

730
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:29,720
it always surprises me dean will be able
to answer a question about moves that

731
00:44:29,721 --> 00:44:33,380
he doesn't actually do in
a normal basis. Yeah, yeah.

732
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,730
He knows exactly how to do it.
He knows how to defend it.

733
00:44:35,731 --> 00:44:40,020
He knows how to set it up, but he doesn't
actually do that move and, and that's,

734
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,390
that's how good you got to be.
The other weird thing is you get,

735
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,400
you catch someone like dean in
a position that's totally new,

736
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:50,311
you know,

737
00:44:50,311 --> 00:44:53,910
just some random and he actually knows
like a thing to do to get out of it,

738
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:58,890
you know, and you think, how
do you, how do you know that,

739
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:01,740
you know, some weird like leg
ride position. He's like, Oh,

740
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:04,860
if you turn your knee outward and then
you pinch your ankles, you'll, you'll,

741
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,470
it'll make them adjust lead.

742
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:08,670
You can come up on the arm and you
can get out and you're like, wait,

743
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:10,980
how do you know that?
I've never been in this position.

744
00:45:10,981 --> 00:45:13,530
I've been doing Jujitsu for 25 years and
I've never been this position before.

745
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:18,360
And now you're telling me that this is
just you, you know this and he probably,

746
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,490
some of these positions
he's probably never been in.

747
00:45:20,491 --> 00:45:25,350
It's like codes like writing code where
if you kind of know the certain like

748
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:29,460
general rules to things, you
can start figuring it out,
figuring it out. You know,

749
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:32,490
like, and someone like Dean who was
like, that's optional, Dude. No,

750
00:45:32,491 --> 00:45:33,360
but that's a thing.

751
00:45:33,361 --> 00:45:35,940
There's a difference between what I'm
talking about because what I'm talking

752
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:39,990
about is he actually knows
specifically, he's not like, hey,

753
00:45:39,991 --> 00:45:44,460
here's what would work based on the
general rules of grappling. It's like, no,

754
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,660
here's what you do in
this specific situation.

755
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:53,680
That is weird. Yeah. But that's
just completely well rounded. Yeah.

756
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,440
That's just completely well rounded.

757
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:59,190
You're saying at some point he has had
that experience with that move. Yes.

758
00:45:59,191 --> 00:46:03,000
He's done it some way or
another and he said, oh,

759
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:07,080
or he's done a much narrower approach
of what you're talking about. Like he,

760
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:09,960
he's not, maybe not that exact thing,
but it's so close to it. He's like,

761
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,680
here's what happens. Here's
what's going on. Yeah. Yeah.

762
00:46:13,681 --> 00:46:17,460
Similar but not the same. Like he goes
beyond just having the principles.

763
00:46:17,461 --> 00:46:22,461
It's like principals coupled
with experience coupled
with knowledge and dean's

764
00:46:23,101 --> 00:46:25,290
mind for that is,
it's really,

765
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:29,610
it's crazy uncanny with that as far as
like kids' knowledge and what he can sort

766
00:46:29,611 --> 00:46:30,391
of figure it out or whatever.

767
00:46:30,391 --> 00:46:34,800
It's almost like while you're
doing what you do during the day,

768
00:46:34,801 --> 00:46:36,630
he's like in a room
just thinking about it.

769
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:40,380
You would think you will think that you
would think that he's sitting around

770
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,020
with like four screens,

771
00:46:43,021 --> 00:46:47,040
like youtube screens and he's watching
different things at once and then he has

772
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:49,440
some sort of like weird, uh, uh,

773
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,880
control where he can view different
angles and comprehend them. But no,

774
00:46:53,881 --> 00:46:57,700
he has a weird, because I
know he doesn't do that. Yeah.

775
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:02,700
He used to do it though,
but he has a weird, um,

776
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:06,480
he, he's got his mind. It's just
made to do that. His mind is just,

777
00:47:06,481 --> 00:47:11,481
has a greater understanding of it than
a normal person and even an abnormal

778
00:47:12,361 --> 00:47:16,290
person. Yeah. But yeah, that makes
sense. Like, you know, if you're,

779
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:20,520
if you're thorough or thoroughly trained
or have a lot of experience and you've

780
00:47:20,521 --> 00:47:22,530
been through the pitfalls
ups, downs, you know,

781
00:47:22,531 --> 00:47:27,120
you kinda that that light is kind of on
for you. But if you just sorta lock out,

782
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:27,751
well yeah.
You know,

783
00:47:27,751 --> 00:47:31,660
we work with companies who work with like
startup companies where it's not that

784
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:36,490
the people haven't scrapped to
get where they are, but you know,

785
00:47:36,491 --> 00:47:40,750
you get funded and you got 12 people on
your team and then all of a sudden you

786
00:47:40,751 --> 00:47:44,410
get a massive funding and you're expecting
to roll into production of something

787
00:47:44,411 --> 00:47:47,470
and,
and you look up and you got 180 people,

788
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:51,520
you don't have any experience as a
leader and you're expected to lead.

789
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:52,870
And that's,
you know,

790
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,980
a situation that echelon
front gets involved in because
the investors will come

791
00:47:56,981 --> 00:47:59,140
and say, hey look, we got these guys
over here. They're awesome guys.

792
00:47:59,141 --> 00:48:02,320
They're working hard. Guess what?
They got propelled in this position.

793
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:06,370
They're awesome at their job. They don't
know how to lead yet. Can you help them?

794
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,770
Yes. That's what we do Roland,
and make it happen. Make sense?

795
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,690
You can't expect someone to know how
to lead if they've never been in a

796
00:48:13,691 --> 00:48:17,050
leadership position before. Can
some people pull it off? Yes.

797
00:48:17,051 --> 00:48:19,720
It's not a big number though.
It's not a big number.

798
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,670
Continuing. Ooh, this is a good one.

799
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,000
He who has not first laid his foundations
may be able with great ability to lay

800
00:48:31,631 --> 00:48:33,010
them afterwards,

801
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:38,430
but they will be laid with trouble to
the architect and danger to the building.

802
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:42,790
So lay a good foundation.
This is another,

803
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,980
another thing that's important
when it comes to Jujitsu,

804
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:49,750
don't be learning the Gogo Blada day four,
but they're just so fun.

805
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:54,700
I know people want to learn that Gogo
Plata and they don't know how to do a

806
00:48:54,701 --> 00:48:58,570
straight arm lock. Yeah, that's a
problem. And that's why though, right?

807
00:48:58,571 --> 00:48:59,740
I mean even like this,

808
00:48:59,741 --> 00:49:03,230
that's why like people won't focus
on the foundation because it's like,

809
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:07,640
that part's not as like fun short
term payoff types of Richard area.

810
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,380
It's more fun. It's go, go,
go. Plata is more fun. Whoa,
look at that. It looks fancy.

811
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:14,410
It looks cool. It's like,
um, I think it was dean with,

812
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,730
he was teaching a class and
he was teaching them how
to fall or something like

813
00:49:18,731 --> 00:49:21,380
that. Not for a long time, just
a little bit. And then, uh,

814
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:24,780
he was teaching like a
position and whatever. This
is actually a while ago. Uh,

815
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,490
and then towards the end he was like,
all right. All right. All right. Nope.

816
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:32,860
The kind of like no one said
anything like, Hey, when
are we going to learn blah,

817
00:49:32,861 --> 00:49:33,970
blah, blah. And no one said anything.

818
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:38,230
He but dean said it as
if people were saying,

819
00:49:38,231 --> 00:49:41,560
well when are we gonna learn something
fun kind of thing. So Tina was like,

820
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:45,010
all right, all right, I'll
teach you a submission. You
kind of like, cause he knew,

821
00:49:45,011 --> 00:49:48,700
he knows like the submission hold
is the fun part to learn in Jujitsu.

822
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:53,470
I mean as far as the spectrum,
when you start yes. When you
start. Yeah, yeah. Fully,

823
00:49:53,471 --> 00:49:55,390
fully. Cause you just,
you know, you think,

824
00:49:55,391 --> 00:49:59,170
oh I don't understand why it's good
for me to lay this way on some other or

825
00:49:59,171 --> 00:50:01,940
shrimp across the room.
Like what the heck is that?

826
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:05,090
That's laying a good foundation.
That's what that is.

827
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:09,430
Otherwise you've got to do it in.
It's going to be hard to do.

828
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:12,280
The same thing with businesses.
When you start a business,

829
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:16,240
start it with a good foundation so you
don't have to go back in there afterwards

830
00:50:16,241 --> 00:50:21,010
and perform surgery on something that's
already been constructed. All right,

831
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:26,040
now this is Mackey of alien
in a pretty serious way.

832
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,100
The name of this one is

833
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,080
called, or this is, I would say this
is kind of what stems some of you,

834
00:50:31,081 --> 00:50:36,081
the reputation concerning those who have
obtained a principality by wickedness,

835
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:38,600
but,
and I say this establishes,

836
00:50:38,601 --> 00:50:41,120
but this actually goes
against sort of that standard

837
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:46,400
machiavellian attitude.

838
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:52,850
So here we go.
This is one of the historical

839
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:58,040
examples that he gives that I'm
actually gonna read because it's pretty,

840
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,910
pretty cool.
A gaff Achilles.

841
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:05,720
The Sicilian became king of Syracuse,
not only from a private,

842
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:11,480
but from a low, an abject position.
This man, the son of a potter,

843
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:15,500
through all the changes in his
fortunes always led an infamous life.

844
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:20,300
Nevertheless, he accompanied his infamous
with so much ability of mind and body,

845
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:24,260
having devoted himself to
the military profession.

846
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:29,380
He rose through the ranks to be prayed
or of Syracuse being established in that

847
00:51:29,691 --> 00:51:34,691
position and having deliberately resolved
to make himself prince and to seize by

848
00:51:34,821 --> 00:51:37,280
violence without obligation to others,

849
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,340
that which had been
conceited to him by a cent.

850
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:44,870
He came to an understanding
for this purpose with the,

851
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:47,420
with Ama car,
the car theny Jin,

852
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,810
who with his army was fighting in Sicily.

853
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:57,010
One morning he assembled the people and
the Senate of Syracuse as if he had to

854
00:51:57,081 --> 00:52:02,081
discuss with them things relating to
the republic and at a given signal,

855
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:07,970
the soldiers killed all the senators and
the richest of the people, these dead.

856
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,320
He seized and held the Princeton of
that city without any civil commotion.

857
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:15,260
And although he was twice
routed by the Carthaginians,

858
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,690
he ultimately and ultimately besieged.

859
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:20,660
Yet not only was he
able to defend his city,

860
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:24,530
but leaving part of his men
for its defense with others,

861
00:52:24,531 --> 00:52:29,450
he attacked Africa and in a short
time raised the siege of Syracuse.

862
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:32,060
The Carthaginians reduced
to extreme necessity.

863
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:37,061
We're compelled to come to terms with a
golf Achilles and leaving Sicily to him

864
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:41,090
had to be content with
the possession of Africa.

865
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:45,150
So this guy is,

866
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:50,270
is just gets after it and destroys people
and kills people in order to get into

867
00:52:51,441 --> 00:52:55,610
a good position. Now, you might think that
Machiavelli would say, hey, that's great.

868
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,250
Here's what it actually
says back to the book.

869
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:03,670
Yet it cannot be called talent to slay
fellow citizens to deceive friends,

870
00:53:04,041 --> 00:53:06,980
to be without faith, without
mercy, without religion.

871
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:10,880
Such methods may gain empire,
but not glory.

872
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:12,470
Still.

873
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:17,090
If the courage of a gothic please in
entering into the end and extricated

874
00:53:17,091 --> 00:53:20,990
himself from the dangers be considered
together with his greatness of mind in

875
00:53:20,991 --> 00:53:24,410
enduring and overcoming hardships,
it can not be seen. Why?

876
00:53:24,411 --> 00:53:28,920
He should be less esteemed than the
most notable captain. Oh, there he is,

877
00:53:28,921 --> 00:53:32,460
giving him more credit,
but then he goes back again.

878
00:53:32,461 --> 00:53:37,170
Nevertheless has barbarous, cruelty and
inhumanity with infinite wickedness.

879
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:41,160
Do not permit him to be celebrated
among the most excellent men.

880
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:43,380
What he had treated can,
what do you achieved?

881
00:53:43,381 --> 00:53:47,220
CanNot be attributed to
either fortune or genius.

882
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:49,953
Yeah.

883
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:54,200
So, and I'll go one step further
because this is what I think.

884
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:59,490
I think that when you behave in that
manner, it'll come back to you. Yeah.

885
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:00,730
It'll come back to you tonight.

886
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:03,920
I'm not saying there's going to
come back to the karmic way, dude.

887
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:06,290
That's not what I'm saying.
I'm saying when you,

888
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:09,860
when you inflict damage on people,
they remember it.

889
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:15,250
And there will be a time in some point
when they will have the opportunity to be

890
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:20,420
rain down. Vengeance upon you. Yeah.
So if you act that way, you're gonna,

891
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,410
you're gonna get yours.

892
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:26,150
And so if you treat people with respect
and you treat people as you would like

893
00:54:26,151 --> 00:54:29,240
to be treated,
then it's fine.

894
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:31,220
And when the opportunity
arises for them to cross you,

895
00:54:31,221 --> 00:54:34,010
they'll remember how you treated them and
you treat them well and they say, okay,

896
00:54:34,011 --> 00:54:35,600
you know what?
We're going to give this guy a pass.

897
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,880
But when you screw people over,
they're going to screw you back. Yeah.

898
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,330
At some point.
Yeah.

899
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:47,760
Continuing on. It has to be
remarked that in seizing a state,

900
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:51,660
the usurper ought to examine
closely all those injuries,

901
00:54:51,661 --> 00:54:56,370
which it is necessary for him to inflict
and do them all at one stroke so as to

902
00:54:56,371 --> 00:55:00,390
not have to repeat them daily.
And thus by not unsettling men,

903
00:55:00,391 --> 00:55:05,391
he will be able to reassure them
and win them to himself by benefits.

904
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:10,380
This is a good one. If you're
gonna, if you got to cause damage,

905
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:13,530
rip the bandaid off.
That's what he's saying it all at once.

906
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,660
So if you're going into a
business and you're like, okay,

907
00:55:15,661 --> 00:55:16,980
we're going to have to
eliminate some people.

908
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:22,050
Don't eliminate two guys today and then
two guys in a week and then three days,

909
00:55:22,051 --> 00:55:25,950
three guys in a month, and then three
people in two weeks in and you just,

910
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:28,710
everyone now everyone's walking around,
they're scared of getting destroyed,

911
00:55:28,711 --> 00:55:33,420
they're scared of getting
fired. They don't trust you.
You go in, you go, okay, hey,

912
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:36,780
here's, sorry. Hey, there's some changes.
There's some reductions we've got to make.

913
00:55:36,781 --> 00:55:40,050
Here it is. There's 28 people.
They're going away. What's left?

914
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:42,440
We're going to go forward.
Or when you conquer. Yeah.

915
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:49,400
He who does otherwise either from Tim
[inaudible] or evil advice is always

916
00:55:50,791 --> 00:55:55,780
compelled to keep the knife in his hand.
Right.

917
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,830
Neither can he rely on his subjects,

918
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:04,040
nor can they attach themselves to him
owing to their continued and repeated

919
00:56:04,081 --> 00:56:08,210
wrongs. So you keep stabbing people
every once in a while. Every two,

920
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:11,720
three days I cut someone's head off.
Yeah. These guys are just, you know,

921
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:12,061
first of all,

922
00:56:12,061 --> 00:56:14,580
I got to walk around with a knife all
the time and they're thinking, oh,

923
00:56:14,581 --> 00:56:15,960
I see what he's all about.
Yeah.

924
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:22,970
Continuing for injuries ought
to be done all at one time.

925
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,330
That being tasted less,

926
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:30,390
they offend less benefits ought to be
given little by little so that the flavors

927
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:34,660
of them may last longer.
Oh,

928
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:38,050
so you don't go and give everyone a
yearly bonus at the beginning of the year.

929
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:41,170
Hey, here's all this money.
No. You Go, hey look,

930
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:45,340
there's a good quarter or good month
last month. Coddle something for you.

931
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:50,360
Yup. That tastes last long. If it does,

932
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:56,050
uh, I recommend that with children, by the
way. Okay, good to know what I'm saying.

933
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,150
Yes. You don't give them the
big reward, you make them.

934
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:03,340
You got to earn it to get it. Earn it.
Yeah. Keep it going. Keep it going. Yeah.

935
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:07,100
Continuing and above all things,

936
00:57:07,101 --> 00:57:12,101
a print art to live amongst his people
in such a way that no unexpected

937
00:57:12,291 --> 00:57:13,250
circumstances,

938
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:17,600
whether of good or evil
shall make him change.

939
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:19,750
Okay.

940
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:23,320
Because if the necessity for
this comes in troubled times,

941
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:28,620
you are too late for harsh measures
and mild ones will not help you for,

942
00:57:29,471 --> 00:57:34,210
they will be considered as forced
from you and no one will be under any

943
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:38,110
obligation to you for them.
So what are you saying?

944
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:40,370
There's stay balanced.
So if you,

945
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:43,990
if things are going well in your
company and you're like, Hey,

946
00:57:43,991 --> 00:57:48,100
bonuses all around and then all
of a sudden things get lean.

947
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:52,300
I knew I a no more bonuses or
the other hand is like, oh,

948
00:57:52,301 --> 00:57:55,060
things are going rough and like we're
not giving anyone anything. Hmm.

949
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:57,670
What you need to do is stay
balanced. Hey, here's the budget.

950
00:57:57,671 --> 00:58:00,040
Here's our projected budget.
Here's what we're going to give out.

951
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:03,310
Here's what we're planning to give out.
It may vary a little bit on, you know,

952
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:06,640
up or down from there depending on the
market and depending on how we're doing

953
00:58:06,641 --> 00:58:10,120
it, depending on what the future
look like, you want to be balanced.

954
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:15,050
Don't go hardcore in one
extreme or the other. Yeah.

955
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,133
Okay.

956
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:23,510
Next
we're a leading citizen,

957
00:58:23,511 --> 00:58:28,250
becomes the prince of his country, not by
wickedness or any intolerable violence,

958
00:58:28,251 --> 00:58:30,590
but by the favor of his fellow citizens.

959
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:33,680
This may be called a civil principality,

960
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:38,630
nor is genius or fortune
altogether necessary to attain it,

961
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:40,430
but rather a happy shrewdness.

962
00:58:40,431 --> 00:58:44,300
And this seems to be the
most positive thing that he,
this happy shoot. It's like,

963
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:48,140
oh, you're making good
decisions, shrewd decisions.

964
00:58:48,141 --> 00:58:50,360
And that's how you come into power
and people aren't happy with it.

965
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:55,700
Like that seems like the best possible
way to take over a cool according to this

966
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:03,070
continuing one, cannot buy fair
dealing and without injury to others.

967
00:59:03,071 --> 00:59:04,490
Satisfy the nobles.

968
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:09,050
But if you can satisfy the people for
their object as more righteous than that

969
00:59:09,051 --> 00:59:09,771
of the nobles,

970
00:59:09,771 --> 00:59:14,330
the latter wishing to oppress and the
former only desire not to be oppressed.

971
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,560
So who's more important? The nobles
or the people. The people, yeah,

972
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:23,740
that's not very machiavellian or
it's not the tradition machiavellian.

973
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,550
Thank you.
Consideration.

974
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:32,060
It is to be added also that a prince can
never secure himself against a hostile

975
00:59:32,061 --> 00:59:34,520
people because of there being too many.

976
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:38,210
Whilst from Noble's he can secure
himself as they are few in number

977
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:42,140
make a connection with
your people continuing.

978
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,340
The worst that a prince may expect from
a hostile people is to be abandoned by

979
00:59:46,341 --> 00:59:51,080
them but from hostile nobles he has not
only to fear abandonment but also that

980
00:59:51,081 --> 00:59:54,670
they will rise against him for they
being in these affairs more far.

981
00:59:54,671 --> 00:59:59,480
Seeing in a student always come forward
in a time to save themselves and to

982
00:59:59,481 --> 01:00:04,481
obtain favors from him whom they expect
to prevail and he goes on about these

983
01:00:05,031 --> 01:00:09,080
nobles a little bit more. Nobles ought
to be looked at mainly in two ways.

984
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:14,770
They either shape their course in such
a way as binds them entirely to your

985
01:00:15,441 --> 01:00:17,820
fortune or they don't.
So there's two D,

986
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:19,490
Two different kinds of
people you'll have with you.

987
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:23,080
People that just get on
board or don't they get off?

988
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:25,100
They get on board or they don't.

989
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:32,450
And then he says when for
their own ambitious ends,

990
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,980
they shun binding themselves.

991
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:40,460
It is a token that they are giving more
thought to themselves than to you and to

992
01:00:40,681 --> 01:00:45,360
prince ought to guard against such
and to fear them as if they were open

993
01:00:45,361 --> 01:00:46,350
enemies.

994
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:51,990
Because in adversity they
will always help to ruin you.

995
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:01,820
Someone that's not on board,
someone that's looking out for themselves,

996
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:05,940
someone that's looking out for
themselves and not looking out for you.

997
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:07,530
It's a problem.
Real problem.

998
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:10,830
It's an you treat them like
an open enemy or view them.

999
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,870
Fear them as if they're are an open enemy.

1000
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:14,183
Yeah.

1001
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:17,440
And then he continues.

1002
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:22,420
But one who in opposition to the people
becomes a prince by the favor of nobles

1003
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:27,450
ought above everything seek to
win the people over to himself.

1004
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:31,150
And this he may easily do if he
takes them under his protection

1005
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:32,900
because men,

1006
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:37,790
when they receive good from him of whom
they were expecting evil are more bound,

1007
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:40,190
are bound more closely
than to their benefactor.

1008
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:44,120
Thus people quickly become more
devoted to him. So, well, he, again,

1009
01:01:44,121 --> 01:01:48,620
he's all about connecting with the troops,
connecting with the troops.

1010
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:51,830
And if they think you're going to treat
them like crap and then you treat them

1011
01:01:51,831 --> 01:01:55,760
well, they're like doubly
devoted to you. It feels better.

1012
01:01:55,761 --> 01:02:00,140
That's the expectation thing. See,
and I can explain that to you too,

1013
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:03,980
with the, with comfort, you
know, like, you know, you can,

1014
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,230
if you're in bed

1015
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:08,403
and then

1016
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:09,620
you know, you hear, I don't know,

1017
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:13,490
chicken outside or something or like a
chain saw like a block away or something,

1018
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,300
you're like,
ah,

1019
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:18,680
I can't relax with that noise or
whatever because you expect to be real

1020
01:02:18,681 --> 01:02:19,980
comfortable,
your bed kind

1021
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:20,730
of thing.

1022
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:25,730
But you go land some chair or sit
on a chair in and it's surprisingly

1023
01:02:26,251 --> 01:02:28,500
comfortable bra,
you'll fall asleep real quick.

1024
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:34,440
So it's Kinda the same deal with the
people though. Mackey Villian naps,

1025
01:02:34,441 --> 01:02:38,520
Bro. That's what I'm talking about. Just
saying when you, when you get all, yeah,

1026
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,410
like, oh, this guy's going
to be a Dick, you know,

1027
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:44,230
and then even then you can look just
on a normal social level, you know, oh,

1028
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:48,330
he's going to be dating. And you meet him
up like, uh, like, you know, movie stars,

1029
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:51,150
right? Let's say they always play
a bad guy or something like that.

1030
01:02:51,151 --> 01:02:54,030
And this goes both ways
too. Um, and you know,

1031
01:02:54,031 --> 01:02:56,400
you meet the movie star in person
and they're all nice, you know,

1032
01:02:56,401 --> 01:02:57,750
but you see them playing the bad guy.

1033
01:02:57,751 --> 01:03:00,990
So you have this weird subconscious
expectation that you just love that guy or

1034
01:03:00,991 --> 01:03:01,824
whatever

1035
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:05,070
they play there. That's how they
are. Yeah. It's like subconscious.

1036
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:08,850
What do you think that those people
that play a bad guy all the time when in

1037
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:12,060
real life they feel like everyone
views me like I'm a jerk,

1038
01:03:12,061 --> 01:03:15,370
so I'm going to be super
nice. Maybe. Maybe. But

1039
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:16,530
actually,
you know what?

1040
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:21,560
I actually hear more about the opposite
where it's like it's the good guy,

1041
01:03:21,961 --> 01:03:22,681
you know,
he's all,

1042
01:03:22,681 --> 01:03:26,220
he's playing the good guy or maybe on
some show or something like that guy's a

1043
01:03:26,221 --> 01:03:28,590
jerk. Yeah. You know, you meet
them in real life. He's not like

1044
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:31,900
that anyway. Same deal. Yeah.

1045
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:35,050
Expectations mean a lot is
what you're getting at. Yup.

1046
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:39,130
Including leadership perspective
and napping perspective. Yes.

1047
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:42,820
And meeting movie stars or
whatever. Yes. Here we go.

1048
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:47,560
A prince who can command
and is a man of courage.

1049
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:49,220
Undismayed an advert in,

1050
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:54,240
in adversity who does not fail in other
qualifications and who by his resolution

1051
01:03:54,671 --> 01:03:59,671
and energy keeps the whole
people encourage such a one
we'll never find himself

1052
01:04:01,271 --> 01:04:06,271
deceived in them and it will be shown
that he has laid his foundations well.

1053
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,220
Again,

1054
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:14,220
this is not what people think Mackey
Machiavelli was talking about.

1055
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,250
It's not what they think he's saying.
Build relationship. Be Strong.

1056
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:19,780
Give to your people.

1057
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:28,870
Continuing a wise prince ought to adopt
such a course that his citizens will

1058
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:33,930
always in every sort and
kind of circumstance have
need of the state and have

1059
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:37,870
him and then he will always find them
faithful. Oh, that one's a little bit.

1060
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:41,200
That one's a little bit, hey mom, you
know you need, you need me here. Yeah.

1061
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:45,080
That one's a little bit
machiavellian tradition. Mack. Yeah.

1062
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:52,230
Continuing whoever shall fortify his
town and shall have managed the other

1063
01:04:54,881 --> 01:04:59,881
concerns of his subjects well and to be
often repeated will never be attacked

1064
01:05:01,661 --> 01:05:05,740
without. Great caution for men
are always adverse to enterprises,

1065
01:05:05,741 --> 01:05:10,000
were difficulties can be seen and it
will be seen not to be an easy thing to

1066
01:05:10,001 --> 01:05:14,680
attack. One Who has his town
well fortified and is not
hated by his people. Again,

1067
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:20,710
try build relationships with your people.
That's what he's saying.

1068
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:27,780
A Prince who has a strong city and has
not made himself odious will not be

1069
01:05:28,121 --> 01:05:30,670
attacked or if anyone should attack,

1070
01:05:30,671 --> 01:05:33,490
he will only be driven off with disgrace.

1071
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,010
So same thing like if you've got a good,

1072
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,620
if your people support you so you can
get attacked and you're going to drive

1073
01:05:38,621 --> 01:05:41,290
that person off,
that attacks you drive off in disgrace.

1074
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:50,670
Quick one here that the arms with which
a prince defenses state are either his

1075
01:05:51,161 --> 01:05:55,480
own or they are mercenaries,
auxiliaries or mixed.

1076
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:58,900
And we says auxiliaries. He's talking
about how if you have an ally,

1077
01:05:58,901 --> 01:06:03,760
you can use their troops, right? So if
you and I are allies and I'm like, Hey,

1078
01:06:03,761 --> 01:06:05,890
echo and be an attack over here,
you can send me some troops.

1079
01:06:05,891 --> 01:06:07,270
Those are my exhilarate troops.

1080
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:10,990
Mercenaries and auxiliaries
are useless and dangerous.

1081
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,690
And if one holds a state
based on these arms,

1082
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:18,490
he will stand neither for from north
safe for they are disunited ambitious,

1083
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:21,370
ambitious and without discipline.

1084
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,710
Unfaithful Valeant before friends,

1085
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:28,740
cowardly before enemies they have neither
the fear of God nor fidelity to men

1086
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:34,350
and destruction is deferred only so long
as the attack is foreign piece one is

1087
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:37,480
robbed by them and in war by the enemy.

1088
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:42,880
The fact is they have no other attraction
or reason for keeping the field than a

1089
01:06:42,881 --> 01:06:47,110
trifle of a stipend, which
is not sufficient to make
them willing to die for you.

1090
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:48,430
They are already enough.

1091
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:53,020
They are ready enough to be your
soldiers whilst you do not make war.

1092
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:57,910
But if war comes they take
themselves off or run from the Pho.

1093
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:02,230
Yeah,

1094
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:07,230
I ain't got a friend that does like
high level security and they were going,

1095
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:13,560
he was going through like a high level
briefing plan if in in like a serious

1096
01:07:14,681 --> 01:07:19,681
disaster scenario with a high paying
client and he was basically head

1097
01:07:22,301 --> 01:07:25,270
incorporated into the plan,
his own family.

1098
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:30,970
So okay. Echoes the High Plan Con Client.
You come to me and say, Hey, I want,

1099
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:31,863
if there's a,

1100
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:36,100
if there's a tr a complete catastrophe,

1101
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:40,060
we're talking chem, bio,
breakout, Zombie apocalypse,

1102
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:43,360
what's the plan? And he
goes, okay, here's the plan.

1103
01:07:43,361 --> 01:07:46,750
He came up with a plan and he put,
I said, okay, echo, here's the plan.

1104
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:49,480
Here's what's going to happen.
Here's where my family is going to be.

1105
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:52,090
And the guy's like, what do you
mean? You're like, Whoa, your family,

1106
01:07:52,091 --> 01:07:55,630
I'm not worried about your family. The
security guys, security guys said, Hey,

1107
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,960
I'm not you guys started guys.
Yes I will be bringing my family.

1108
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:02,200
And the guy's like, wait, why am, why
are you bringing your family? He says,

1109
01:08:02,201 --> 01:08:03,490
cause if I'm not bringing my family,

1110
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:07,960
I'm not going to be there to help
you survive. And the guy says, okay,

1111
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:12,490
fair enough, right? Yes. Hey,
we've got a bunker to go to.

1112
01:08:12,491 --> 01:08:16,430
I'll get you to the bunker, but I'm not
going to get, I'm not to leave my family.

1113
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:20,510
And then you think I'm going to defend
your bunker when my family's out with the

1114
01:08:20,511 --> 01:08:21,620
zombies.
No.

1115
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:26,120
The best thing you could possibly do
is let me bring my family in the bunker

1116
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:30,620
because then I will die before I give up
the bunker. If it's just you, I love you.

1117
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:34,160
I appreciate your giving me money, but
I'm going to take care of my family first.

1118
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:37,430
Yeah. So think about that. It's
a squared away plan, right? Yeah.

1119
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,110
You actually embed yourself inside my
family and you're going to be safe. Yeah.

1120
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:44,540
I'll use some of your money to,
to prepare for the situation,

1121
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:48,130
but then we'll be ready. Yeah.
We're all one team now. Yeah,

1122
01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:55,160
so that turns someone from
a mercenary into, you know,
it's just part of the team.

1123
01:08:57,970 --> 01:08:58,791
Continuing on.

1124
01:08:58,791 --> 01:09:03,110
The mercenary captains are either
capable men or they are not.

1125
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:04,130
If they are,

1126
01:09:04,131 --> 01:09:07,670
you cannot trust them because they
always aspire to their own greatness.

1127
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:12,290
Either by oppressing you who
are their master or others.

1128
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:16,700
Contrary to your intentions.
But if the captain is not skillful,

1129
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,940
you are ruined. The
usual way. Don't. Yeah,

1130
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:24,290
just the usual way of being ruined.
You know what that is?

1131
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,900
That means you just get hacked to death
on the battlefield. That's what it means.

1132
01:09:26,901 --> 01:09:31,010
Yeah. Lose, lose with the mercenaries.
Mercenaries. A loose, loose scenario.

1133
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:36,060
Yeah. Continuing a print
ought to have no. Ah,

1134
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:38,940
let's get in the zone for this one.
Uh,

1135
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:44,690
a prince ought to have no other aim or
fought nor select anything else for his

1136
01:09:45,831 --> 01:09:49,880
study.
Then war and its rules and discipline.

1137
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:51,630
Okay.

1138
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:56,630
For this is the soul art that belongs
to him who rules and it is of such force

1139
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:02,880
that it not only upholds
those who are born princes,

1140
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:07,710
but it often enables men to rise
from a private station to that rank.

1141
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:10,640
And on the contrary,

1142
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:15,970
it is seen that when princes have
thought more of ease then of arms,

1143
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:19,010
they have lost their states.

1144
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:25,540
And the first cause of you're
losing it is to neglect this art.

1145
01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:32,330
And what enables you to acquire a
state is to be the master of the art.

1146
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:38,200
So there you go.
That's general rules for everyone.

1147
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:42,730
Study nothing but war didn't
discipline. Yes. Cool.

1148
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:47,440
Yeah.
Yes it is.

1149
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:48,790
It is interesting,
isn't it?

1150
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:51,243
Okay,

1151
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:51,450
me,

1152
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:56,450
you don't have to go back that far to
where did the way things are going to be

1153
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:59,920
is settled by war a hundred percent and
you could still say that's true today.

1154
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:03,160
I mean, when diplomacy fails, you go
to war. Yeah. That's the way it works.

1155
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:06,310
You and I can have a conversation
if that conversation fails,

1156
01:11:06,311 --> 01:11:09,440
what's gonna Happen?
Accreted disagree. No,

1157
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:15,450
I'm not agreeing to that turns into
a scrap, so I better study. Yeah.

1158
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:17,280
Now,
if,

1159
01:11:17,610 --> 01:11:21,510
if one of us knows that the other one
is going to win on the field of battle,

1160
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:25,120
that's going to make that person a
little bit more apt to agree, right? Yes.

1161
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:29,820
You know what I mean? Yeah. Or agree
to disagree, which ever, no. Well,

1162
01:11:29,821 --> 01:11:33,990
the one person might have to agree
otherwise they're getting choked.

1163
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:40,890
All right,
so now he talks about how how you

1164
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:47,540
continuing on a prince who
does not understand the art
of war over and above the

1165
01:11:48,421 --> 01:11:52,980
other misfortunes already mentioned,
cannot be respected by his soldiers,

1166
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:56,310
nor can he rely on them.
He ought never,

1167
01:11:56,311 --> 01:12:01,170
therefore to have his thoughts,
this to have out of his thoughts,

1168
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:04,200
this subject of war and in peace,

1169
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:08,400
he should addict himself
more to its exercise.

1170
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,270
Then in war,
this he can do in two ways.

1171
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,800
The one by action nearby by study.

1172
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:18,830
So he's saying that in peace time you
can actually addict yourself more to

1173
01:12:19,981 --> 01:12:23,580
exercising war then you can and war
itself. So when it's time to prepare,

1174
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:28,080
you prepare even when no one will not
war going on. That's when you get ready.

1175
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:31,620
You don't wait until you're
getting attacked to start training.

1176
01:12:31,621 --> 01:12:35,940
Jiujitsu you start now. Yeah. I've had
that argument with people that said it.

1177
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:39,060
Well, the thing is it takes really
tall, long time to get good at Jujitsu.

1178
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,870
When are you going to be
attacked? Well, I don't know.

1179
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:44,880
If you get a attack tomorrow,
that's a bummer,

1180
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:46,360
but you're probably not
going to get attacked. To me,

1181
01:12:46,690 --> 01:12:49,320
you're getting attacked in six months.
You might get attacked in a year.

1182
01:12:49,321 --> 01:12:52,740
You might get attacked in four years.
Yeah, you can be really good by that time.

1183
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:58,230
Yeah. Yeah. There was an article,
I think you even came across it,

1184
01:12:58,330 --> 01:13:03,330
you might even have commented on it
online and in the article it was like some

1185
01:13:04,591 --> 01:13:09,180
things that you shouldn't focus on or
whatever as a man or something like this.

1186
01:13:09,570 --> 01:13:14,010
And uh, I thought it was a fake
article and I still think, I mean,

1187
01:13:14,011 --> 01:13:16,170
I don't know if it was real or not,
but whatever.

1188
01:13:16,171 --> 01:13:21,150
Let's just say it was real and it was
like fighting said that's the most wrong

1189
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:23,340
thing of her. And I
actually agree that, oh,

1190
01:13:23,341 --> 01:13:26,950
I actually think that this is so high up.
I kind of agree that this,

1191
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:30,030
with this statement, like you should focus
on this as being really high in your,

1192
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:34,860
in your focus in life. And it really
comes down to a safety thing really.

1193
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:38,850
And look, yeah, it definitely comes
down to a safe thing. I'm not,

1194
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:43,490
I'm not saying like, Hey, just
studied Jujitsu, just study MMA. I,

1195
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:44,910
I'm not saying that right,

1196
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:48,060
because those shouldn't be your primary
interest unless you're a fighter. Right.

1197
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:51,030
And there's some people
that are so into whatever,

1198
01:13:51,031 --> 01:13:53,220
they get sown digit Jujitsu that
the rest of their life falls apart.

1199
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:57,090
I'm not recommending that. Right. Want
you to have a good, well balanced life,

1200
01:13:57,390 --> 01:14:01,750
but if you make Jujitsu a part of
it, it's going to be better. Yes,

1201
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:04,290
it's going to be better.
It's going to adapt to everything else.

1202
01:14:04,291 --> 01:14:07,350
It's going to teach you about
other things. Yeah. Yeah.

1203
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:11,070
And that's not to mention you can fight
a few on, not to mention Peter to,

1204
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,300
he's like a,

1205
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:16,840
he mentioned something about what was it,
it was something to do with golf.

1206
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:18,610
Like basically he was saying,

1207
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:23,170
you have to put all this effort in
and it's too frustrating. And I said,

1208
01:14:23,171 --> 01:14:27,040
wait till you tried to Jitsu and
then someone else said and he said,

1209
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:29,090
that's why I'm not doing it.
Or something like that. Yeah.

1210
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:33,850
Well he said something along those lines
and then I said something like, oh no,

1211
01:14:33,851 --> 01:14:35,560
someone else chimed in.
Hey Golf.

1212
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:38,950
It doesn't teach you
anything like golf has what?

1213
01:14:38,951 --> 01:14:43,660
Transferable skills to life does golf
have? Hey, I'm not hating on golf.

1214
01:14:43,661 --> 01:14:47,560
If you like golf, cool. More power
to you as far as I'm concerned, but

1215
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:54,060
you're not going to be able to take the
skills of a putt and bring them to now.

1216
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:58,270
Okay, well let's, let's reach here.
I guess you will, cause you know,

1217
01:14:58,271 --> 01:15:00,730
you're gonna be able to relax. You're
going to learn how to get to mental focus.

1218
01:15:00,731 --> 01:15:03,850
So that's good. Yeah. Good. In
that perspective we'll give credit,

1219
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:09,070
but direct transferable physical
techniques,

1220
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:13,620
very limited. Limited. Especially when
you start comparing them to g to, yeah,

1221
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:16,240
golf can give you some
of the same things that,

1222
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,910
that like when I talk about shooting,
like when you get good at shooting,

1223
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:21,100
it gives golf can give you some
of those same things cause you're,

1224
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:22,390
you're under pressure,
you've got to focus,

1225
01:15:22,391 --> 01:15:24,460
you've got to put the last
shot out of your mind.

1226
01:15:24,461 --> 01:15:25,780
You've got to focus on
what you're actually doing.

1227
01:15:25,781 --> 01:15:28,210
You can't worry about the next shock
cause there's a lot of things that it can

1228
01:15:28,211 --> 01:15:32,200
help there. There's some motor
skills, some sports stuff for sure.

1229
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:38,010
But I cut you off. What were you saying?
What was the thing? But I don't know.

1230
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:42,740
I was, I was super hyped on whatever I
was about to say the article. Oh yeah.

1231
01:15:42,890 --> 01:15:45,340
So it was like fighting, you
shouldn't, you know, fight or whatever.

1232
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:49,900
And what made it even worse?
A lot worse is the explanation as to why.

1233
01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:53,080
What was the reason why,
if I remember correctly,

1234
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:55,750
it was because you shouldn't be fighting.
That's why

1235
01:15:57,350 --> 01:16:00,190
you only play it if you lose
your temper, you know, like, no,

1236
01:16:00,191 --> 01:16:04,000
you should own it in a nutshell you
say because you shouldn't be fighting,

1237
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:07,060
so you shouldn't focus on, on, on
learning how to fight or whatever. Here's,

1238
01:16:07,061 --> 01:16:11,380
here's the, the ultimate dichotomy
in this situation. The more,

1239
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:14,350
the better you can fight, the less you're
going to have to find. Exactly right.

1240
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:18,310
And most of us, in fact, I would,

1241
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:22,690
I'm almost tempted to say all of us,
everybody who is a trained fighter,

1242
01:16:22,691 --> 01:16:26,200
unless you're talking about competition,
you don't train to fight.

1243
01:16:26,201 --> 01:16:29,490
So you can go get into fights with meat.
No, that's not the way, the reason.

1244
01:16:29,530 --> 01:16:32,230
Not even like a little bit of the region.
Okay.

1245
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,500
I can't think of anyone

1246
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:40,840
that I've known in training Jujitsu
that their goal is like, Hey,

1247
01:16:40,841 --> 01:16:43,450
I'm doing this so I can go,
uh,

1248
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:48,190
antagonize people and actually
get in to get myself into fights.

1249
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:50,500
There's no one that you're right.
There's no change. I haven't, I mean,

1250
01:16:50,501 --> 01:16:55,501
I'm sure there's a couple complete
jerks somewhere out there that have done

1251
01:16:55,781 --> 01:16:59,050
that, but I haven't done any yet. And
even thinking about that, it'd be like,

1252
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:03,610
that'd be weird seeing, I'm going to be
different when someone's like a bouncer.

1253
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:06,010
Right? Oh, you were a bouncer.
Right. And it's like, oh,

1254
01:17:06,011 --> 01:17:08,860
I want to know how to handle
myself if I get into a fight. Yeah.

1255
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:14,140
But you'd rather just be polite
to people until it was be polite.

1256
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:19,170
Right. Until then. Be Nice until
it's time to not be nice. Yeah.

1257
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:21,860
That's what I'm talking about the
way we used to do it right there.

1258
01:17:23,570 --> 01:17:27,830
Exactly right. Even then, by no means,

1259
01:17:27,831 --> 01:17:31,820
it's literally the opposite direction.
It's not so I know how to go fight guys.

1260
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:36,920
You know? It's more so you know
what to do in the event of a fight.

1261
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:41,060
Now, I will say this, I have to
look at this from a perspective.

1262
01:17:41,150 --> 01:17:44,720
When I was younger,
like before I joined the military,

1263
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:51,160
there was times when we were getting in
fights just to get into fights and if

1264
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:55,940
Jujitsu would have been a thing,
I probably would have been doing it.

1265
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:01,540
Ah, I was just young and stupid. So were
all my friends. Right. So here and here's,

1266
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:06,710
here's kind of the, I call it a dichotomy,
but I think it's more like, uh, sure.

1267
01:18:06,711 --> 01:18:08,840
I'll call it a dichotomy.
It's like a catch 22,

1268
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:13,310
so like when you don't know how to fight,
like before you take Jujitsu. Oh yeah.

1269
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:14,150
Um,
same,

1270
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:18,320
same boat where it's like getting in
a fight seems more appealing when you

1271
01:18:18,321 --> 01:18:21,350
learned you do too. And here's the proof.
By the way, when you learned you to,

1272
01:18:21,351 --> 01:18:23,180
you don't really want
to do it maybe at first,

1273
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:27,380
maybe at first your white
belt or whatever. Sure. But
think about this blue belt,

1274
01:18:27,381 --> 01:18:29,690
purple belt, Brown belt,
that, and this goes up and up.

1275
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:33,110
The more you advanced get your black belt,

1276
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:37,870
you've been a black belt for like what,
1314 years or something like this one.

1277
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,650
A brand new white belt comes in.

1278
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:44,270
Do you want to roll with him or you want
to roll with Andy? Andy, why Andy's good.

1279
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:46,170
Exactly right.
So you want to,

1280
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:50,990
you don't want to go test your skills
against some guy weird on the street.

1281
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:56,060
You know you want to go practice and
learn and prove that you're like good with

1282
01:18:56,120 --> 01:19:00,580
other good people. You know other
people who are trained. So it's like it,

1283
01:19:00,590 --> 01:19:05,480
it makes no sense that want to get where
you're going with that is when you're

1284
01:19:05,481 --> 01:19:06,710
good or no.

1285
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:10,580
Like let's say Amen to go learn how
to fight the your first Jujitsu class.

1286
01:19:10,581 --> 01:19:12,710
You're like, okay, I'm not going to get
any fights. You know what I'm saying?

1287
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:18,640
Which is I think a very realistic thing
and I think if I was a 15 year olds old

1288
01:19:18,831 --> 01:19:22,520
again and Jujitsu exist and I was like
all, I'm going to go learn how to fight.

1289
01:19:22,730 --> 01:19:25,220
I would have gone in there one class and
I'd be like, I'm not getting any fights.

1290
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:26,181
This stuff,

1291
01:19:26,181 --> 01:19:28,870
cause you never know who knows this
stuff because you're going to judge glass

1292
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:32,300
and you get choked out by someone that
is half years or maybe three quarters

1293
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:37,220
your size. Yeah. That's a scary thing.
Sunstar looking around going, wait,

1294
01:19:37,221 --> 01:19:40,970
who knows this? I'm not. Your
confidence goes way down when you,

1295
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:45,350
well let's put your yeah,
I guess is your coffee.

1296
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:48,590
It's yeah, it's absolutely
true. And I was in the, Oh man,

1297
01:19:48,591 --> 01:19:51,650
I felt that it was overwhelmed
because I was in like, like you said,

1298
01:19:51,651 --> 01:19:56,030
I was a bouncer. So even at like
when you get your blue belt,

1299
01:19:56,031 --> 01:19:59,060
it's like that's when you're kind of
the most fiery, I think in certain ways.

1300
01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:03,080
And so I'm looking around and I'm
like, yeah, you know, I could do this.

1301
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,500
I could take that guy. He's bigger, but
I could take them like I know I can.

1302
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:10,080
But then you're like, wait, what up bro?
What? Y'All don't know who that guy is,

1303
01:20:10,090 --> 01:20:11,620
you know, kind of be one wrestler, Bro.

1304
01:20:11,621 --> 01:20:15,930
What if you caught yourself or you found
yourself in a rear naked choke in a

1305
01:20:15,931 --> 01:20:20,130
real fight, bro, you're, you're
kind of done man. You'd be in big,

1306
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:25,230
big trouble for that. Yeah.
So when you think about that
and you're like, man, yeah,

1307
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:26,130
just like are you said,
Bro,

1308
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:29,550
I'm not getting any into any fights
there is that this goes even further.

1309
01:20:29,551 --> 01:20:33,360
So this article that you're talking about
that said you shouldn't learn how to

1310
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:36,990
fight because you shouldn't be fighting.
Yeah. Shitting, get into fight the actual,

1311
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:38,640
if you feel the urge to fight,

1312
01:20:38,641 --> 01:20:41,540
the best thing you can do to quell that
urge to go learn how to fight. Yeah.

1313
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:46,110
I think he said the best thing
is to go learn meditation. No,

1314
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,710
Sam Harris, where are you at? We're
not, that's not going to help us.

1315
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:51,780
I'm not against meditation,
but as a,

1316
01:20:51,781 --> 01:20:55,640
as a replacement for learning how to
fight and negative. Sorry man. And,

1317
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:59,070
and you know what?
I've had Tim Ferris and Peter,

1318
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:03,740
and I don't know if we talk about this
with Sam yet, that they think they,

1319
01:21:03,770 --> 01:21:04,380
they,

1320
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:09,380
they impose meditation onto my
Jujitsu for me right there like that.

1321
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:11,910
Is there like,
hey joc would,

1322
01:21:11,911 --> 01:21:16,650
the things that people are trying to
get from meditation is what you get when

1323
01:21:16,651 --> 01:21:20,220
you go and you do Jujitsu. Yeah.
Like your mind gets emptied,

1324
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:25,400
your focused but not focused. There's all
these things and I'm sure I'm, you know,

1325
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:28,200
people that are in the meditation will
say, no, you're missing it and I'm fine.

1326
01:21:28,230 --> 01:21:29,640
That's fine. I know I am. Whatever.

1327
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,500
But what I'm saying is there are
some similarities. There has to be,

1328
01:21:34,501 --> 01:21:38,470
because Tim and Sam all,
you know, they both did.

1329
01:21:38,471 --> 01:21:42,540
You just do and do meditation and
there's crossover there somewhere.

1330
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:44,730
Tim for sure has told
me that. Tim, for sure,

1331
01:21:44,731 --> 01:21:47,040
it's taught me that even
like weightlifting, you know,

1332
01:21:47,041 --> 01:21:51,870
even when you're trying to do a movement,
right? You're trying to do a snatch,

1333
01:21:51,871 --> 01:21:55,710
you're trying to do some movement that
you have to focus on that puts you,

1334
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:58,530
I mean, you know what it's like when
you go to Jujitsu, you come home,

1335
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:03,060
you feel so good, but you don't feel
good because of the physical workout.

1336
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:05,880
You feel good because your
brain got emptied. You know?

1337
01:22:05,881 --> 01:22:10,530
And I think that's part of what
meditation is. I don't know, but yeah.

1338
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:16,410
Well, yeah, I would think so too.
Yet. It's like an overlap. Yeah.

1339
01:22:17,050 --> 01:22:21,780
There's a bunch of overlap there. So
just sum this up. Learn how to fight,

1340
01:22:21,910 --> 01:22:25,680
right. Learn not to bake bread. Don't
listen to that Weirdo article, man.

1341
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,780
The thing is that there's a good chance
that it was like a one of those parody,

1342
01:22:28,781 --> 01:22:32,580
whatever. I, I forget what even it was on.

1343
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:38,160
Yeah, but it wasn't on like
a parody website. I don't,

1344
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:42,180
I didn't recognize it as a parody rep
website, but I don't remember the website,

1345
01:22:42,210 --> 01:22:45,960
to be honest with you. I just saw
these weird things. To me it was,

1346
01:22:46,410 --> 01:22:51,210
it was the kind of where all of the items
on his little list or like we're wrong.

1347
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:54,900
Fighting was just the one that I felt
song as a mouth and it was just wrong.

1348
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,230
This is joke,
joke,

1349
01:23:00,890 --> 01:23:05,320
joke. Okay. So as I was
wrapping up that one,

1350
01:23:05,321 --> 01:23:06,100
he says that

1351
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:08,140
that you can study war,
you can ask yourself,

1352
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:13,030
it's exercise yourself in war two
different ways. He says one by action,

1353
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:17,740
the other by study. Here we go. Here's
the action part. As regards action,

1354
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:23,400
he ought above all things to keep his
men well organized and drilled to follow

1355
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:25,990
incessantly.
The chase,

1356
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:31,170
which is like hunting and patrolling
by which he accustomed his body to

1357
01:23:31,481 --> 01:23:36,481
hardships and learn something of the
nature of the localities and gets to find

1358
01:23:37,151 --> 01:23:40,060
out how the mountains rise,
how the valley's open out,

1359
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:45,090
how the planes lie to end to understand
the nature of rivers and marshes and in

1360
01:23:46,001 --> 01:23:51,001
all of this to take the greatest care
which knowledge is useful in two ways.

1361
01:23:51,281 --> 01:23:52,000
Firstly,

1362
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,410
he learns to know his country and is
better able to undertake its defense

1363
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:00,340
afterwards by means of knowledge
and observation of that locality.

1364
01:24:00,341 --> 01:24:04,330
He understands the ease.
Any AC understands with ease,

1365
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:09,070
any other which it may be necessary
for him to study hereafter because the

1366
01:24:09,071 --> 01:24:09,700
hills,

1367
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:14,700
valleys and planes and rivers and marshes
that are for instance in Tuscany have

1368
01:24:14,771 --> 01:24:16,900
a certain resemblance to
those of other countries.

1369
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:19,990
So that with the knowledge
of the aspect of one country,

1370
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:23,050
one can easily arrive at
a knowledge of others.

1371
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:28,570
And the prince that lacks this skill,
the essential which is desirable,

1372
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:31,030
that a captain should possess for a,

1373
01:24:31,031 --> 01:24:35,470
teaches him to surprises enemy to select
quarters to lead armies to array the

1374
01:24:35,471 --> 01:24:39,160
battle to besiege towns to his advantage.

1375
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:40,920
Yeah.

1376
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:44,370
So boom, go out train. Yeah,

1377
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:49,020
train incessantly,
train incessantly,

1378
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:53,820
get out there. That's what
you have to do. And now,

1379
01:24:53,821 --> 01:24:55,850
so that's the action part
and the other part, now here,

1380
01:24:55,890 --> 01:25:00,150
now we get to the study part
to exercise the intellect.

1381
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:05,180
The prince should read histories and study
the actions of illustrious men to see

1382
01:25:07,831 --> 01:25:12,831
how they have borne themselves in war
to examine the cause of their victories

1383
01:25:12,991 --> 01:25:16,980
and defeat so as to avoid the
ladder and imitate the former.

1384
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:18,920
Oh Wow.

1385
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:24,360
Listen to this podcast. This is
what we're saying. Yeah. Read.

1386
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:29,690
If you don't got time to read, press
play. Boom. Yeah. Get some. All right.

1387
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:31,910
I wish I had this podcast.
Yeah.

1388
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:36,020
I wish I had this podcast to listen to
when I was 17 years old when I was 19

1389
01:25:36,021 --> 01:25:36,471
years old,

1390
01:25:36,471 --> 01:25:41,080
when I was 23 years old when I was 33
years old when I was 37 years old. Yeah.

1391
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:44,990
Are you kidding me?
Yeah.

1392
01:25:44,991 --> 01:25:49,880
That practice part is, it seems like,
oh yeah, that makes sense. You know,

1393
01:25:49,881 --> 01:25:53,150
but I think that, I'm not sure
if you've read the whole thing,

1394
01:25:53,151 --> 01:25:55,580
but it seems kind of even understated.

1395
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:59,960
Cause like even when you study
something, right, you're like, okay,

1396
01:25:59,961 --> 01:26:03,380
I know what to do. Part seems to
understated the study part or the action.

1397
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:04,160
The action part.

1398
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,560
Yeah.
He says incessantly.

1399
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:09,270
He says Dick to yourself
to exercise before.

1400
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:13,220
I don't know if that's understated or
not. I didn't read it. Well, none at all.

1401
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:16,730
Yeah, maybe you know, maybe
it was just me. Maybe.

1402
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:21,240
I think it's just so important that that
should be the whole book. I Dunno. Okay.

1403
01:26:21,410 --> 01:26:24,770
Whatever. But either way. Either
way then regardless of how,

1404
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:27,020
but training is so important
to you is what you're saying.

1405
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:32,080
I think that actually doing it is
because without it you just lose.

1406
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:33,860
I think you lose more than half.

1407
01:26:33,861 --> 01:26:37,640
If you consider study action and
you don't do the action part,

1408
01:26:37,641 --> 01:26:40,580
I think action is more than half
where it feels like it anyway.

1409
01:26:40,581 --> 01:26:43,130
Because like if you,
let's say you haven't done,

1410
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:45,470
did you to school in a long
time or eight or anything,

1411
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:48,650
you are correct when it comes to sports,

1412
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:53,680
but he's talking about actual going to
war and you can't take a nation to war.

1413
01:26:54,110 --> 01:26:55,580
You can't even take a platoon to war.

1414
01:26:55,581 --> 01:26:58,550
You can't take a company to war
without going to war. So yes,

1415
01:26:58,551 --> 01:27:00,410
you can do the training
exercises in the field,

1416
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:05,560
but there is absolutely a massive benefit
to studying what has happened in the

1417
01:27:07,881 --> 01:27:09,920
past. And I'll tell you from
a leadership perspective,

1418
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:13,550
like if I was a business person,
I'd be reading about business business,

1419
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:18,650
not so much business leadership
books that this is how to lead,

1420
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:23,180
but this is what happened
in this situation.

1421
01:27:23,390 --> 01:27:28,390
And the perfect example for me of that
from the war perspective is about face by

1422
01:27:28,521 --> 01:27:31,070
Hackworth.
That book is not a leadership book,

1423
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:34,940
but when you read it from a
leadership through a leadership lens,

1424
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:38,030
it's all about leadership.
It's all about leadership.

1425
01:27:38,330 --> 01:27:42,350
And so you can take books that are
about business, not about like, hey,

1426
01:27:42,351 --> 01:27:47,330
this is a leadership instructional manual,
but hey, this is what happened in this.

1427
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:51,680
As this company fell apart or this like
you study those books, read those books.

1428
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:54,870
Then it gives you a little bit more
of an advantage. But in both fees,

1429
01:27:54,890 --> 01:27:58,340
what you really should be looking
for is the dynamics of human nature.

1430
01:27:58,341 --> 01:28:00,350
And you can figure out
like, okay, when people,

1431
01:28:00,351 --> 01:28:03,080
when this happened inside this company
or this happened in this battle,

1432
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:07,250
people act this way. People acted that way
and now I understand them better. Yeah.

1433
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:10,160
If you're seeing it for the first time,
just like we talked earlier about,

1434
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,950
if you see, if you know an
our lock is coming, if you,

1435
01:28:12,970 --> 01:28:15,680
if you know how to defend an arm
lock or you know what's coming,

1436
01:28:15,681 --> 01:28:17,300
you at least know to pull your elbow in,
right?

1437
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:22,220
If you read a book that explains what
happened in a battle or in a business

1438
01:28:22,221 --> 01:28:25,640
scenario and you go, okay, here's what
happened right here, I recognize it.

1439
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:26,451
Maybe not exactly,

1440
01:28:26,451 --> 01:28:29,420
but it's close enough and I can expect
this response from the enemy or from the

1441
01:28:29,421 --> 01:28:30,800
competitor or from my people.

1442
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:35,100
I can make an adjustment and
at least not blind. Yeah,

1443
01:28:35,370 --> 01:28:39,290
and that's kind of the part I was
talking about. Where were the, yeah,

1444
01:28:39,291 --> 01:28:41,810
that's right. And I think
that's right. Even the, the,

1445
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:47,450
the inverse where it's like,
okay, you can, let's say
you study this, I know this,

1446
01:28:47,451 --> 01:28:49,610
you know,
I know that this is how it works,

1447
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:54,530
but you've never been in the situation
to recognize how it feels, you know, in,

1448
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:57,260
in, uh, you know, so like
training for war or whatever.

1449
01:28:57,261 --> 01:28:59,810
Like let's say in your guys' case where,
how you would always,

1450
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:02,040
you say you try your
best to make the training

1451
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:05,370
as realistic as possible.
So that's the actual action kind of stuff.

1452
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:08,250
Even just something as simple
as roll roll plate, you know,

1453
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:10,410
where it's like you're trying to simulate,

1454
01:29:10,411 --> 01:29:14,370
you're trying to introduce the action
part of it more so than Jay, it's study.

1455
01:29:14,430 --> 01:29:18,990
Sure. Got It. You know, so yeah. So when
you find yourself in the real situations,

1456
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:22,500
I'll give you a case in point.
You can read extreme ownership.

1457
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:24,630
You can read the dichotomy of leadership.

1458
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:29,810
I'll have someone that's read and
read and studied both those books,

1459
01:29:30,121 --> 01:29:34,590
listen to every podcast and
roll in and be like, Hey,

1460
01:29:34,591 --> 01:29:37,200
let's role play this right here.
Yeah. And be like, you know,

1461
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:39,960
put them in a scenario where,
where the right answer would be to say,

1462
01:29:39,961 --> 01:29:42,810
hey like that's my fault, here's what I'm
gonna do. Crew. And they'll, they'll say,

1463
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:47,010
well the team needs to do this and
you just think yourself so you're,

1464
01:29:47,011 --> 01:29:47,940
you are correct.

1465
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:53,000
You have to put people in the action as
much as you can because the observation

1466
01:29:55,620 --> 01:30:00,620
of a situation is not as effective a
learning tool as the being involved in the

1467
01:30:03,621 --> 01:30:07,770
situation. Yeah. I do actually agree
with you. Yeah. Cause just like in yours,

1468
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:10,500
in that scenario you just kind of painted,
it's usually,

1469
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:15,530
well I would imagine you could tell me
is it because their feelings almost kind

1470
01:30:15,941 --> 01:30:20,180
of blocked their knowledge at that
point in a way. Yes. Yes. Yeah.

1471
01:30:20,181 --> 01:30:21,630
So if you're in the situation,

1472
01:30:21,631 --> 01:30:25,020
you are now kind of familiar with the
feelings that come along with and for

1473
01:30:25,021 --> 01:30:27,970
instance, you have to learn how
to detach. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Too.

1474
01:30:27,971 --> 01:30:30,340
If you don't know how to detach
and I throw something at you,

1475
01:30:30,341 --> 01:30:32,280
you don't know how you'd detach cause
you know what the right answer is,

1476
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:37,110
but you don't do it. You can't do it.
You don't do it. So that's, that's an,

1477
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:41,490
that's a problem. So yes, put yourself,
put people, put your team, put yourself,

1478
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:46,680
not just study it. Okay, here's
the, here's the, here's what you do.

1479
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:47,700
You study it.

1480
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:52,760
And then from the study you try and
formulate a simulation that you can put

1481
01:30:52,981 --> 01:30:56,130
yourself into. There you go. There's
the answer. Here's the answer.

1482
01:30:57,570 --> 01:30:59,010
Last little section about this.

1483
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:04,530
A wise prince ought never in
peaceful times stand idle,

1484
01:31:04,770 --> 01:31:09,770
but increases resources with industry
in such a way that they may be available

1485
01:31:10,711 --> 01:31:14,400
to him in adversity so
that if fortune chances,

1486
01:31:14,401 --> 01:31:18,300
it may find him prepared
to resist her blows,

1487
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:22,770
he's really into in the peace time,

1488
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:26,130
you work harder and know what
I'm going to agree with them.

1489
01:31:29,010 --> 01:31:29,580
Next.

1490
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:34,580
Every prince ought to desire to be
considered Clement and not cruel.

1491
01:31:37,170 --> 01:31:41,670
That's, again, this is
not tradition Machiavelli,

1492
01:31:42,570 --> 01:31:46,350
but then he says, nevertheless, he ought
to take care not to misuse this clemency.

1493
01:31:46,351 --> 01:31:51,300
So show mercy, but don't get
crazy beat. There's a dichotomy.

1494
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:52,770
Don't get crazy with the mercy.

1495
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:56,190
Does the economy be very merciful
but don't be overly merciful?

1496
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:59,710
You got to be balanced. Can
be a softy. Softy, a prince,

1497
01:31:59,711 --> 01:32:04,240
so long as he keeps his subject United
in loyal not to mind the reproach of

1498
01:32:04,241 --> 01:32:08,620
cruelty because with a few examples,
so he's an hey, you should,

1499
01:32:08,650 --> 01:32:13,150
if you're considered cruel
sometimes that's okay. This is,

1500
01:32:13,330 --> 01:32:18,190
this is tradition
because with a few examples,

1501
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:21,970
he will be more and more soulful
than those who threw too much.

1502
01:32:21,971 --> 01:32:26,971
Mercy allowed disorders to arise from
which follow murders or robberies for

1503
01:32:28,601 --> 01:32:31,540
these are want to injure the whole people.

1504
01:32:31,690 --> 01:32:36,420
Whilst those executions which originate
with the prince, offend the individual.

1505
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:40,360
So every once in a while if somebody
gets out of line, you got to,

1506
01:32:40,361 --> 01:32:41,194
you got to kill him,

1507
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:46,360
he got to execute and that is actually
going to keep the people more under

1508
01:32:46,541 --> 01:32:49,930
control more so they'll
discipline gives you more freedom,

1509
01:32:50,370 --> 01:32:52,090
a little discipline and
freedom there on that one.

1510
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:56,860
I think that's the old making eggs, an
example. Sure. It's making an example,

1511
01:32:56,890 --> 01:32:59,350
but what he's saying is, hey, the
example and the hurts one person.

1512
01:33:01,470 --> 01:33:02,303
Well that's cool.

1513
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:08,380
Here's the famous section when I'll read
a pretty big chunk of it. Upon this,

1514
01:33:08,381 --> 01:33:13,381
a question arises whether it be better
to be loved than feared or feared than

1515
01:33:14,231 --> 01:33:18,190
loved. It may be answered that
one should wish to be both,

1516
01:33:19,930 --> 01:33:22,960
but because it is difficult
to unite them in one person,

1517
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:27,460
it is much safer to be feared than
loved when of the two either must be

1518
01:33:27,461 --> 01:33:28,294
dispensed with.

1519
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:31,600
So he's saying the best thing you
could do is balanced her dichotomy.

1520
01:33:32,530 --> 01:33:37,530
That's the best thing to do because this
is to be asserted in general of men,

1521
01:33:37,630 --> 01:33:42,040
that they are ungrateful,
fickle, false, cowardly,

1522
01:33:42,070 --> 01:33:46,510
covetous. And as long as you succeed, they
are yours entirely. So he's saying, look,

1523
01:33:46,511 --> 01:33:49,330
people are kind of dastardly,
but as long as you're doing good,

1524
01:33:49,331 --> 01:33:52,630
as long as you're successful, you're,
you'll be fine. But, and then he says,

1525
01:33:52,631 --> 01:33:53,920
when you're,
when you're being successful,

1526
01:33:53,921 --> 01:33:57,310
he says they will offer you their
blood, property, life, and children,

1527
01:33:57,640 --> 01:34:01,480
as is said above,
when the need is far distant.

1528
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:05,740
So as long as I'm doing good, goes like,
hey, yeah, I'll be there for you bro.

1529
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:11,800
But when and approaches they turn
against you and that prince who relying

1530
01:34:11,801 --> 01:34:16,420
entirely on their promises has neglected
other precautions is ruined because

1531
01:34:16,421 --> 01:34:19,180
friendship,
this is a big critical,

1532
01:34:19,770 --> 01:34:24,770
a differentiation because friendships
that are obtained by payments and not by

1533
01:34:26,351 --> 01:34:28,990
greatness or nobility of
mind may indeed be earned,

1534
01:34:29,170 --> 01:34:33,190
but they are not secured and in time
of need, they cannot be relied upon.

1535
01:34:33,490 --> 01:34:37,870
And men have less scruple and offending
one who is beloved and one who's feared

1536
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:40,990
for love is preserved by
the link of obligation,

1537
01:34:41,110 --> 01:34:44,470
which owing to the basis of man is
broken at every opportunity for their

1538
01:34:44,471 --> 01:34:49,150
advantage. But fear preserves, you buy a
dread of punishment, which never fails.

1539
01:34:49,570 --> 01:34:54,570
So I think one of the differences
he's talking about that when I,

1540
01:34:55,180 --> 01:34:59,770
when I give you money, when I treat
you well, when I, you know, Eh, em,

1541
01:34:59,810 --> 01:35:03,860
em, generous to you. You love
me. But that's, that's different.

1542
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:07,880
That's different.
That's not like a respectful though.

1543
01:35:07,990 --> 01:35:08,823
Yeah.

1544
01:35:10,970 --> 01:35:13,520
But then, and then he says
this as well. Nevertheless,

1545
01:35:13,521 --> 01:35:18,230
a prince ought to inspire fear in
such a way if he does not win love.

1546
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:19,670
He avoids hatred

1547
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:25,640
because he can endure very well
being feared. Whilst he is not hated,

1548
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:30,170
which will always be as long as he
abstains from the property of his citizens

1549
01:35:30,171 --> 01:35:34,670
and subjects from their
weapon. So he said, look,

1550
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:38,570
you can't just run rough shot over
people and take the women and take their

1551
01:35:38,571 --> 01:35:39,240
property.

1552
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:40,073
Hm.

1553
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:45,440
But when it is necessary for him to
proceed against the life of someone,

1554
01:35:45,530 --> 01:35:50,450
he must do it on proper
justification and for manifest cause.

1555
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:51,470
But above all things,

1556
01:35:51,471 --> 01:35:54,650
he must keep his hands off the property
of others because men more quickly

1557
01:35:54,651 --> 01:35:58,160
forget the death of their father,
the loss of their patrimony.

1558
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:01,760
Cheap.
So yeah.

1559
01:36:01,850 --> 01:36:05,240
Firm but fair then he's seen
be firm but fair. Yeah. Yeah.

1560
01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:09,290
Overly from east saint from
when you have to be. Yeah.

1561
01:36:09,860 --> 01:36:14,390
But fair is just as important.
It's a dichotomy that you have to balance.

1562
01:36:14,391 --> 01:36:17,450
That's what he's saying.
He just didn't write it as cleverly.

1563
01:36:20,910 --> 01:36:21,743
Uh,

1564
01:36:21,950 --> 01:36:26,060
when a prince with his army and under
and has under his control a multitude of

1565
01:36:26,061 --> 01:36:26,511
soldiers,

1566
01:36:26,511 --> 01:36:30,710
then it is quite necessary for him to
disregard the reputation of cruelty again.

1567
01:36:30,711 --> 01:36:32,290
So he again, he's saying,
well, you gotta be cool.

1568
01:36:32,291 --> 01:36:35,320
You've got to be cool for without it.
He would never hold his army,

1569
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:40,330
United or dispose to its duties among
the wonderful deeds Hannibal of Hannibal.

1570
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:45,290
This one is a numerated that having led
an enormous army composed of various

1571
01:36:45,291 --> 01:36:47,870
races of men to fight in foreign lands.

1572
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:52,460
No dissensions arose either
among them or against the prince,

1573
01:36:52,670 --> 01:36:55,790
whether in his bad or in his good fortune.

1574
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:59,990
This arose from nothing else
than is inhuman cruelty,

1575
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:02,120
which with boundless,

1576
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:07,160
which with his boundless Fowler made him
very revered and terrible in the sight

1577
01:37:07,161 --> 01:37:10,520
of his soldiers. Revered and
terrible. There is a dichotomy.

1578
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:14,990
He was revered and terrible,
but without that cruelty,

1579
01:37:14,991 --> 01:37:18,020
his virtues were not sufficient
to produce this effect.

1580
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,980
Returning to the question
of being feared or loved,

1581
01:37:21,981 --> 01:37:26,810
I've come to the conclusion that men
loving according to their own will and

1582
01:37:26,811 --> 01:37:28,490
fearing according to that of a prince,

1583
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:33,200
a wise print should establish himself
on that which is in his own control and

1584
01:37:33,201 --> 01:37:34,250
not in that of others.

1585
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:39,340
He must endeavor only to
avoid hatred as is noted,

1586
01:37:40,910 --> 01:37:42,710
so be balanced

1587
01:37:44,210 --> 01:37:47,340
and he said over and over again
before this that you know,

1588
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:49,970
having the connection with the
people and if the people are loyal,

1589
01:37:49,971 --> 01:37:51,590
like that's the most important thing.

1590
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:54,410
If they hate you or if they don't like
you or if they're just afraid to you,

1591
01:37:54,411 --> 01:37:55,244
they don't have that,

1592
01:37:55,510 --> 01:37:57,750
then you think about it when you're
afraid of somebody and you have the chance

1593
01:37:57,751 --> 01:38:02,670
to to rise up and smash them down.
You don't want to live live in fear.

1594
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,830
No, you do. So

1595
01:38:07,890 --> 01:38:09,300
next section,

1596
01:38:09,301 --> 01:38:13,860
everyone admits how praiseworthy it is
in a prince to keep faith and to live

1597
01:38:13,861 --> 01:38:16,230
with integrity and not with Kraft.

1598
01:38:16,231 --> 01:38:20,010
And he used that word craft
meaning like guile and sort of,

1599
01:38:20,970 --> 01:38:22,440
yeah.
Nevertheless,

1600
01:38:22,441 --> 01:38:26,370
our experience has been that those princes
who have done great things have had

1601
01:38:26,371 --> 01:38:31,260
good faith of little account and have
known how to circumvent the intellect of

1602
01:38:31,261 --> 01:38:32,700
men by craft.

1603
01:38:33,210 --> 01:38:36,690
And if in the end overcome
those who relied on their work.

1604
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:42,600
You must know there are two ways of
contesting one by law, the other by force,

1605
01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:45,570
the first Methodist proper demand,
the second to beasts,

1606
01:38:45,870 --> 01:38:48,990
but because the first is
frequently not sufficient,

1607
01:38:48,991 --> 01:38:52,080
it is necessary to have
recourse to the second.

1608
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:54,413
So look,

1609
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:56,900
we want to do things that are a nice way,

1610
01:38:56,930 --> 01:38:59,660
but if we have to got
to get a little savage,

1611
01:39:01,130 --> 01:39:05,000
there is therefore it is necessary for
a prince to understand how to avail

1612
01:39:05,001 --> 01:39:08,930
himself of the beast and the
man. Again, this is a dichotomy.

1613
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:14,320
You got to know that sometimes you got
to get Chris get nuts and sometimes you

1614
01:39:14,571 --> 01:39:15,880
got to not.
Yeah,

1615
01:39:18,110 --> 01:39:22,820
it is necessary for prince know how to
make use of both natures and that one

1616
01:39:22,821 --> 01:39:25,250
without the other is
not as durable a prince.

1617
01:39:25,251 --> 01:39:30,140
Therefore being compelled knowingly to
adopt the beast ought to choose the Fox

1618
01:39:30,141 --> 01:39:34,310
and the lion because the lion cannot
defend himself against snares and the Fox

1619
01:39:34,311 --> 01:39:37,730
can not defend himself against wolves.
Therefore,

1620
01:39:37,820 --> 01:39:41,630
it is necessary to be a fox to discover
the snares and Elian to terrify the

1621
01:39:41,631 --> 01:39:42,464
wolves.

1622
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:46,940
Those who rely simply on the lie and
do not understand what they are about.

1623
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:49,133
Yeah,

1624
01:39:49,340 --> 01:39:54,340
he who has known best how to employ
the Fox has succeeded the best.

1625
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:58,760
No, there you go. You know,
can't just be the brick brute.

1626
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:00,620
You've got to have a little bit of that,

1627
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:07,100
but it is necessary to know of this is it,
this is where you get,

1628
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:09,980
this is going traditional
machiavellian attitude.

1629
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:15,070
It is necessary to know how well
to know well how to disguise this

1630
01:40:15,171 --> 01:40:20,060
characteristic and to be a great pretender
and dissembler and men are so simple

1631
01:40:20,270 --> 01:40:24,590
and so subject to present necessities
that he who seeks to deceive will always

1632
01:40:24,591 --> 01:40:26,540
find someone who will allow
himself to be deceived.

1633
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:29,660
There's a sucker born every minute.
So he's saying you got to act these ways,

1634
01:40:29,661 --> 01:40:33,770
but you've got to cover it up, which is
going back to Richard the third, Hey,

1635
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:36,290
I'm going to cover this stuff and make
it up. Make it look like I'm a saint,

1636
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:41,780
but really I'm the devil. A
prince, especially a new one,

1637
01:40:41,781 --> 01:40:46,781
cannot observe all those things for which
men are esteemed being often forced in

1638
01:40:47,331 --> 01:40:51,620
order to maintain the state, to act
contrary to fidelity, friendship,

1639
01:40:51,650 --> 01:40:54,040
humanity, and religion. So he's saying,

1640
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:57,640
look, those are the, those are the nice
ways to act, but sometimes you can't.

1641
01:40:57,670 --> 01:41:00,250
You can't keep it. Yeah. Therefore,

1642
01:41:00,251 --> 01:41:04,270
it is necessary for him to have a mind
ready to turn itself accordingly as the

1643
01:41:04,271 --> 01:41:08,560
winds in variations of fortune's
force it yet, as I've said above,

1644
01:41:08,561 --> 01:41:13,060
do not deserve diverge from the
good if he can avoid doing so.

1645
01:41:13,210 --> 01:41:17,680
But if compelled then to know
how to set it about, so, hey,

1646
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,270
if you can,
you gotta be,

1647
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:22,900
you maintain your fidelity and friendship
and humanity and religion if you can.

1648
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:26,170
If you can't, you gotta know how
to get after it the other way.

1649
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:30,940
That's what he's saying. And again,
my personal belief is if you do that,

1650
01:41:31,090 --> 01:41:33,900
it's going to come back. It's going
to come back. And I'm not again,

1651
01:41:33,910 --> 01:41:37,570
like I'm not talking about a spiritual
Karma that's going to come back.

1652
01:41:37,571 --> 01:41:41,230
I'm talking about real life. We'll
come back and you screw someone over,

1653
01:41:41,530 --> 01:41:44,590
their time will come.
When you screw enough people over,

1654
01:41:44,950 --> 01:41:49,510
everyone's time is going to come.
Yeah. And that, I mean doesn't,

1655
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:52,840
maybe I got it wrong,
but so Jordan Peterson for example,

1656
01:41:52,841 --> 01:41:54,100
he'll talk about this too,
right?

1657
01:41:54,101 --> 01:41:57,790
Like where you have to be a good person
with the capability of being a bad

1658
01:41:57,791 --> 01:42:02,530
person. That's optimum. The optimum
thing is, hey you, you can get, you can,

1659
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,800
you can bring the funder if you have too,
but you shouldn't,

1660
01:42:05,801 --> 01:42:08,890
you shouldn't have to.
This is not quite that.

1661
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:11,320
This is saying sometimes you got
to do some underhanded stuff.

1662
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:12,251
That's what he's saying.

1663
01:42:12,251 --> 01:42:16,050
He's saying sometimes you've got to do
some underhanded stuff and I'll tell you

1664
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:18,190
back in these days,
I mean,

1665
01:42:18,191 --> 01:42:21,070
think about how much more
communication there is today.

1666
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:23,410
You do something that's out aligned.

1667
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:28,800
Everyone's going to know it was not going
to take them very long to know it yet.

1668
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:32,590
Weird men, like when you see, you know,
some people they're just sorta like that,

1669
01:42:32,820 --> 01:42:34,260
you know and know,
you know,

1670
01:42:34,290 --> 01:42:38,530
it's almost like they can't see very far
ahead of themselves or something like

1671
01:42:38,531 --> 01:42:40,840
that. Like they'll like,
oh yeah, yeah, yeah,

1672
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:43,870
they're just shortsighted and they just
screw this guy over and screwed that

1673
01:42:43,871 --> 01:42:45,370
person over.
And next thing you know,

1674
01:42:45,371 --> 01:42:47,590
they look up and they wonder
why they didn't get hired.

1675
01:42:47,591 --> 01:42:49,270
Or they wonder why they
didn't get the contract.

1676
01:42:49,271 --> 01:42:52,000
Or they wonder why they
didn't get promoted. It's
like, oh, guess what you did?

1677
01:42:53,170 --> 01:42:57,790
And it's so, it's almost like a thought,
like, well shoot, I didn't like,

1678
01:42:57,791 --> 01:43:01,690
I didn't screw you over you like, why
are you acting like this kind of thing?

1679
01:43:01,691 --> 01:43:05,170
Or why are you treating me like
this? Like I'm some, uh, you know,

1680
01:43:05,350 --> 01:43:09,620
Fox or clever, what craft
person or whatever. Um,

1681
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:12,730
but meanwhile everyone's seen what you're
doing now just because you didn't do

1682
01:43:12,731 --> 01:43:15,160
it to me. No, Bro. We know what
kind of person. One of the,

1683
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:20,400
one of the hardest things for some
people is they think that they're a fox.

1684
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:28,800
They think that they can get
one over on you and, and,

1685
01:43:28,870 --> 01:43:32,140
and they just, they just, it's
so obvious. Like you said,

1686
01:43:32,141 --> 01:43:36,700
it's so obvious you're looking at them
going, hey man, everyone, not just me.

1687
01:43:37,330 --> 01:43:39,520
Everyone can see. And you
know what, sometimes people,

1688
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:43,120
not everyone can see what
they're doing and if you're,

1689
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:45,850
and they think they're getting away
with something and you're looking at him

1690
01:43:45,851 --> 01:43:50,530
going, man, I can see right through what
you're doing. Why are you doing this?

1691
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:54,260
Yeah. Cause I can see exactly
what you're doing. Yeah.

1692
01:43:54,740 --> 01:43:56,660
And the fact that you're doing it and I,

1693
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:00,680
I you don't think I can see that
you're doing it. It proves two things.

1694
01:44:00,681 --> 01:44:05,630
Number one, you don't think I'm very
smart and number two, you're underhanded.

1695
01:44:06,290 --> 01:44:10,730
Neither one of those is going to work
out for you because this is not my first

1696
01:44:10,731 --> 01:44:15,140
Rodeo and I'm watching what you're doing
and this is going to come back in a

1697
01:44:15,141 --> 01:44:19,310
very hard way on you don't do that.
Don't do that.

1698
01:44:19,550 --> 01:44:24,230
There's varying levels of that too.
Like he can be like real devious stuff,

1699
01:44:24,260 --> 01:44:27,230
you know? It can be that, but it can be
like Ooh, no harmful things to and the,

1700
01:44:27,310 --> 01:44:30,710
and the point there is semi harm.
You meant to say harmless.

1701
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:34,340
A semi harmless things. Yeah. Some are
homeless, homeless things, but there's,

1702
01:44:34,650 --> 01:44:38,410
but also sometimes, and I always try
and get people to pay attention. This,

1703
01:44:38,780 --> 01:44:42,440
if you're under handed with me,
if you try and sneak one by me,

1704
01:44:42,770 --> 01:44:47,060
it's a trust violation. That's
a problem. That's a problem.

1705
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:47,871
And you know what,

1706
01:44:47,871 --> 01:44:52,130
I'm not going to confront you but
I know you and it's even worse.

1707
01:44:52,910 --> 01:44:55,400
It would be better off for you if
I just came and said, hey, echo,

1708
01:44:55,640 --> 01:44:59,630
you know you tried to slide this one under
on the expense account and you bought,

1709
01:44:59,690 --> 01:45:00,411
you know,
whatever.

1710
01:45:00,411 --> 01:45:05,411
You took your family out for dinner on
the company credit card and I saw that

1711
01:45:06,501 --> 01:45:09,950
and you shouldn't do that.
That would be better than me.

1712
01:45:10,030 --> 01:45:12,630
You mean it'd be better for you?
Yeah.

1713
01:45:12,850 --> 01:45:17,300
Forget a little plants than me not saying
anything and just noting it and now

1714
01:45:17,301 --> 01:45:18,530
I'm tracking you.
Yeah,

1715
01:45:18,531 --> 01:45:22,730
because it's like all my knowledge of
that kind of gives me a foot to stand on

1716
01:45:22,731 --> 01:45:25,400
so I can kind of maneuver so
it can continue to maneuver.

1717
01:45:25,401 --> 01:45:29,150
I didn't say anything and I
won't say anything. I'll let you,

1718
01:45:29,210 --> 01:45:33,800
I'll let you continue to
reveal your dark arts.

1719
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:38,390
My cards. Yes. Reveal your reveal,
your nature, your nature's cheating,

1720
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:42,200
your nature's stealing from me.
You're all looking at me like,

1721
01:45:42,590 --> 01:45:45,530
like I actually did that. I'm trying to
think. Shoot. Did I do that right now?

1722
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:53,900
But I'm just saying think about it,
but the point of what you're saying,

1723
01:45:53,901 --> 01:45:58,160
like whenever we all this year on
this discombobulated right now,

1724
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:03,500
going through that expense report in
your head, boy, when people can see you,

1725
01:46:03,620 --> 01:46:05,450
but they can't see themselves,
you know,

1726
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:09,650
even with like small stuff,
big stuff,

1727
01:46:09,651 --> 01:46:13,880
small stuff and one can see what
you're doing. My point is though,

1728
01:46:13,881 --> 01:46:14,750
not every not,

1729
01:46:14,780 --> 01:46:19,780
it's not always that everyone can see
sometimes not everyone can see and that

1730
01:46:19,791 --> 01:46:24,791
actually encourages a person to continue
their little crafty ways that they

1731
01:46:25,281 --> 01:46:28,010
think they're so good at.
And it's so,

1732
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:33,710
when I see that happening,
it's just so disappointing.

1733
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:38,420
It's so disappointing because you're not
even in a situation where you're with

1734
01:46:38,421 --> 01:46:43,340
me because like, oh, I bet you know, I
brought you into my house. Basically.

1735
01:46:43,341 --> 01:46:45,260
If someone's going to be able to
do that to me, they're in my house.

1736
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:47,960
If you're in my house and
you're trying to, you know,

1737
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:53,430
steal some milk from the drawer when I'm
not looking sure. Without permission.

1738
01:46:53,431 --> 01:46:56,760
Yeah. Yeah. Like you're trying to
sneak that thing in your bag. You can,

1739
01:46:56,761 --> 01:46:59,360
if you would ask me, you'd
had, you'd had a case in milk,

1740
01:46:59,910 --> 01:47:02,220
but you didn't ask what you thought is,
I'm going to try and get this.

1741
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:06,710
That's a whole different
way things shake out. Yeah.

1742
01:47:07,290 --> 01:47:09,770
And I'm not even gonna say
anything to you. He's gonna live,

1743
01:47:09,790 --> 01:47:13,470
I'm not gonna say anything to you.
You can have that milk, that milk.

1744
01:47:13,471 --> 01:47:16,840
It was worth it because now
I know your nature. Yup.

1745
01:47:17,070 --> 01:47:20,900
So the torment is kind of not
punish snow, but okay. So no,

1746
01:47:20,910 --> 01:47:23,100
there won't be any
punishment. Right. But, but,

1747
01:47:23,310 --> 01:47:26,160
but in a year you're going
to look up and be like, Hey,

1748
01:47:26,161 --> 01:47:28,260
I know that we got this opportunity.
I'm saying, Oh yeah, yeah,

1749
01:47:28,261 --> 01:47:30,600
I took the opportunity.
Unfortunately I don't have room for you.

1750
01:47:30,740 --> 01:47:34,320
And the opportunity, there
you go. That's what happens.

1751
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:38,920
But when you're surprised when I say
people can do to you and say, well,

1752
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:46,200
you know what they say harmless ways or
semi harmless ways, of course, the teeny,

1753
01:47:46,201 --> 01:47:49,110
teeny, tiny things. And we said this
before, like name dropping, right?

1754
01:47:50,090 --> 01:47:52,530
And that goes a, that's
not, it doesn't go into dvs.

1755
01:47:52,531 --> 01:47:56,190
That's not necessarily a devious a
crafty thing or nothing like that,

1756
01:47:56,191 --> 01:48:01,191
but I'm just saying the concept of someone
doing something where we all see what

1757
01:48:02,011 --> 01:48:04,650
you're doing kind of thing, you know? So
he name drop someone and it's like, well,

1758
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:05,550
most was part of the story,

1759
01:48:05,551 --> 01:48:07,950
but it's like probably we all see what
you're doing right there, you know?

1760
01:48:08,430 --> 01:48:11,760
But it's,
I think it's hard for us sometimes.

1761
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:15,690
Like I just named dropped a
Sam Harrison, Tim Ferris. No,

1762
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:18,330
it didn't feel like you
did, you know? Then again,

1763
01:48:18,331 --> 01:48:22,110
you did say their first and last name,
so that's kind of a symptom. No names.

1764
01:48:22,111 --> 01:48:24,420
I think the opposite. If I would
have said, oh well, you know,

1765
01:48:24,421 --> 01:48:28,890
I was talking to Tim week, me and
Sam were having a quick conversation.

1766
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:31,550
That's true. Yeah. I think you told me
that before too. And you're right. Yeah,

1767
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:36,300
it seems more, I guess it
depends, but yes. Yes Tim.

1768
01:48:36,990 --> 01:48:39,600
And then you're hoping in the back
of your mind that asked him who,

1769
01:48:39,601 --> 01:48:43,950
so you get to say, oh, just Tim
Ferriss, you no big deal. So maybe,

1770
01:48:43,951 --> 01:48:46,170
but the point is people
see what you're doing,

1771
01:48:46,470 --> 01:48:51,150
but sometimes it's hard for us to see
that they can see that, you know? Yes,

1772
01:48:51,210 --> 01:48:53,550
they're unaware.
So you get to stop and it's a sad thing.

1773
01:48:54,660 --> 01:48:58,410
Assume that people can see what you're
doing. There's a good lesson for the day.

1774
01:48:58,830 --> 01:49:02,450
Assume that the little maneuvers
that you think are all clandestine,

1775
01:49:02,700 --> 01:49:05,730
assume that people can actually see,

1776
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:08,700
assume that people are a little
bit smarter than you think.

1777
01:49:08,701 --> 01:49:11,690
Assume that you're maybe not as
smart as you think you are. Yeah,

1778
01:49:11,970 --> 01:49:14,850
because there's little crafty moves
that you think are fooling people.

1779
01:49:15,030 --> 01:49:17,730
They don't,
and they reveal you.

1780
01:49:17,850 --> 01:49:22,850
Your nature as being underhanded and
people don't like underhanded people,

1781
01:49:23,010 --> 01:49:27,750
especially me. Well, you
should. It's a common thing.

1782
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:31,680
Yeah. Jack. All right, moving on

1783
01:49:34,230 --> 01:49:37,440
for this reason. Again, we're talking
about how sometimes you have to,

1784
01:49:37,830 --> 01:49:42,810
you have to violate, you
have to, according to this,

1785
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:45,360
sometimes people have to
act a little underhanded.

1786
01:49:45,390 --> 01:49:47,980
You have to act devious or whatever.
And here's what he says about that.

1787
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,840
For this reason to prince
ought to take care of that.

1788
01:49:49,841 --> 01:49:54,460
He never lets anything slip from his
lips that does not replete with the above

1789
01:49:54,461 --> 01:49:59,461
named five qualities that he may
appear to him who sees and hears him

1790
01:50:00,250 --> 01:50:04,150
altogether. Merciful,
Faithful, humane, upright,

1791
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:08,710
and religious. So again, this is Richard
the third and there's a whole backstory.

1792
01:50:08,711 --> 01:50:11,560
I'll give them Richard the third on
why Shakespeare wrote it that way,

1793
01:50:11,770 --> 01:50:16,060
but he definitely wrote it that way
and it clearly from that opening,

1794
01:50:16,330 --> 01:50:18,730
he's literally doing what
it says in this book.

1795
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:23,170
Men judge generally more by
the eye then by the hand,

1796
01:50:23,171 --> 01:50:25,570
because it belongs to
everybody to see you,

1797
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:28,870
to few to come to touch with you.

1798
01:50:29,410 --> 01:50:32,980
Everyone sees what you appear to be.
Few really know what you are.

1799
01:50:32,981 --> 01:50:36,100
And those few do not dare oppose
themselves to the opinion of many.

1800
01:50:37,060 --> 01:50:39,250
So how you look is how
you're going to be judged.

1801
01:50:40,750 --> 01:50:45,010
The prince must consider how to avoid
those things which will make him hated or

1802
01:50:45,011 --> 01:50:49,780
contemptible. This is not
traditional machiavellian thought.

1803
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:54,940
It makes him contemptible to be
considered fickle, frivolous, a feminine,

1804
01:50:55,060 --> 01:51:00,060
mean spirited irresolute from all of
which a print should guard himself as from

1805
01:51:00,761 --> 01:51:05,440
a rock. And he should endeavor
to show his actions, greatness,

1806
01:51:05,470 --> 01:51:08,530
or showing his actions, greatness,
courage, gravity, and fortitude.

1807
01:51:08,830 --> 01:51:11,050
And in his private
dealings with his subjects,

1808
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:15,550
let him show that his judgments are
irrevocable and maintain himself in such

1809
01:51:15,551 --> 01:51:20,230
reputation that no one can hope
either to deceive or get around him.

1810
01:51:22,060 --> 01:51:22,930
Good advice.

1811
01:51:24,070 --> 01:51:28,870
And I guess one of my points is
everything that's, so check this out.

1812
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:33,700
Everything that we're saying about
how people can see what you're doing,

1813
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:38,980
he's recommending that you act this way,
but no one will know.

1814
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:41,590
And you just have to pretend like
you're actually a good person.

1815
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:45,040
And what we're both saying is that doesn't
work. And I agree that doesn't work.

1816
01:51:45,090 --> 01:51:48,130
Yeah. So the idea that you're
going to be all behind the scenes,

1817
01:51:48,131 --> 01:51:50,740
you're going to be, you're going
to be all crafty behind the scenes,

1818
01:51:50,741 --> 01:51:51,760
and no one's going to catch you.

1819
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:56,920
And you're just going to act
with greatness and courage
and act with gravity and

1820
01:51:56,921 --> 01:51:59,290
fortitude. And that's how you're gonna
Act, but you're not really not that way.

1821
01:51:59,410 --> 01:52:04,410
My point is that it doesn't work because
people can see through it and they will

1822
01:52:04,811 --> 01:52:06,850
see through it and they might not
see through it today or tomorrow,

1823
01:52:06,851 --> 01:52:09,610
but they'll see through it in a week
or two weeks or a month or a year.

1824
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:12,370
And then you're going to be,
you're going to be undone.

1825
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:14,853
That's a good word.

1826
01:52:17,470 --> 01:52:21,280
A prince ought to rec and conspiracies
of little account when his people hold

1827
01:52:21,281 --> 01:52:25,660
him in esteem. But when it's hostile
to him and bears hatred toward him,

1828
01:52:25,870 --> 01:52:29,020
he ought to have fear.
He ought to fear everything and everybody.

1829
01:52:29,110 --> 01:52:32,320
So if you're people support you,
don't worry about conspiracies.

1830
01:52:32,440 --> 01:52:35,170
If your people are hostile towards you,
you better be.

1831
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:39,970
You better take note and well ordered.

1832
01:52:39,971 --> 01:52:42,020
States and wise princes have ever,

1833
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:46,400
I've taken every care to drive the
nobles to desperation and keep the people

1834
01:52:46,401 --> 01:52:50,650
satisfied and contented for this is
one of the most important objects, uh,

1835
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:53,870
prince can have, is to keep
people, keep your troops,

1836
01:52:54,860 --> 01:52:56,300
keep the people in the game.

1837
01:52:58,490 --> 01:53:02,150
There was never a new prince who is
disarmed his subjects rather when he has

1838
01:53:02,151 --> 01:53:06,650
found them disarmed, he's always
armed them because by arming them,

1839
01:53:07,010 --> 01:53:08,660
those arms become yours.

1840
01:53:08,780 --> 01:53:12,890
Those men who were distrusted become
faithful and those who are faithful are

1841
01:53:12,891 --> 01:53:17,810
kept. So, and your subjects become
Ed Harris. Now I think we're,

1842
01:53:17,811 --> 01:53:22,460
this really plays into from a leadership
perspective is when you get, when you,

1843
01:53:22,490 --> 01:53:25,310
when you are in a leadership
position and you empower people,

1844
01:53:25,730 --> 01:53:30,000
you give them power, it builds faith
that builds trust, it builds it and,

1845
01:53:30,010 --> 01:53:34,050
and the power that they,
that you give to them becomes yours.

1846
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:39,620
We, the more powerful you
make your subordinates, the
more powerful you become.

1847
01:53:39,830 --> 01:53:40,400
Yeah.

1848
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:43,160
If you have the ego that you can put
in checks so that you don't mind giving

1849
01:53:43,161 --> 01:53:45,950
some of that power away because
it'll come back to you 10 fold.

1850
01:53:47,630 --> 01:53:51,020
And here's what happens on the other end
of spectrum when you disarmed them at

1851
01:53:51,021 --> 01:53:51,351
once,

1852
01:53:51,351 --> 01:53:55,370
you offend them by showing that you
distrust them either for cowardice or for

1853
01:53:55,371 --> 01:53:59,420
want of loyalty. And either of these
opinions breeds hatred against you,

1854
01:53:59,930 --> 01:54:01,730
and because you cannot remain on armed,

1855
01:54:01,731 --> 01:54:03,920
it follows that you turned to mercenaries,

1856
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:06,620
which are a character which aren't
of a character already shown.

1857
01:54:08,090 --> 01:54:11,300
So once again,
if I take your power from you,

1858
01:54:12,890 --> 01:54:17,570
then that's offensive.
Yeah. So be careful. Give,

1859
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:20,000
try and give people power.
Don't take it away from them.

1860
01:54:21,140 --> 01:54:26,140
It takes a high level of lead security
and confidence with your own leadership

1861
01:54:27,561 --> 01:54:30,340
that you can give it away.
The more you're more confident you are,

1862
01:54:30,370 --> 01:54:31,310
the more you can give it away.

1863
01:54:31,490 --> 01:54:35,030
The more paranoid you think people
are going to be better than you.

1864
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:38,210
The harder it is. Give it away. The
worst leader you are, the worst leader.

1865
01:54:38,211 --> 01:54:40,730
You become the worst situation,
the less power you have.

1866
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:42,320
Just trying to hold it off for yourself.

1867
01:54:42,660 --> 01:54:43,493
Hmm.

1868
01:54:47,290 --> 01:54:52,290
Continuing the best possible fortress
is not to be hated by the people,

1869
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:57,230
not traditional machiavellian fought.

1870
01:54:58,510 --> 01:55:01,750
The best possible fortress is
not to be hated by the people.

1871
01:55:03,010 --> 01:55:03,620
Okay.

1872
01:55:03,620 --> 01:55:06,380
Yeah, it seems like a good
start. It's a great start

1873
01:55:08,060 --> 01:55:10,820
because although you may
hold the fortress yet,

1874
01:55:10,821 --> 01:55:14,080
they will not save you if the people
hate you. The fortress isn't gonna.

1875
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:17,930
If people hate you, the fortress isn't
gonna help. Don't even bother. Oh,

1876
01:55:17,931 --> 01:55:22,130
you built up a great fortress. Cool. We're
gonna go. We're gonna seed you. Yeah.

1877
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:24,440
Cause we ain't no water,
no food.

1878
01:55:25,450 --> 01:55:28,760
Huck and fire over the walls continuing.

1879
01:55:28,790 --> 01:55:33,790
Nothing makes a prince so much esteemed
as great enterprises and setting a fine

1880
01:55:36,020 --> 01:55:40,080
example.
Set a good example,

1881
01:55:41,610 --> 01:55:45,600
not traditional
machiavellian. Ooh, good one.

1882
01:55:45,601 --> 01:55:49,650
The choice of servants is of no little
importance to a prince and they are good

1883
01:55:49,651 --> 01:55:54,651
or not according to the discrimination
of the prince and the first opinion which

1884
01:55:55,021 --> 01:56:00,021
one forms of a prince and
of his understanding is by
observing the men he has

1885
01:56:01,291 --> 01:56:04,230
around him.
And when they are capable and faithful,

1886
01:56:04,290 --> 01:56:08,400
he may always be considered wise because
he has known how to recognize the

1887
01:56:08,401 --> 01:56:11,640
capable and to keep them faithful.
But when they are otherwise,

1888
01:56:11,641 --> 01:56:16,470
one cannot form a good opinion of him
for the prime error which he made wasn't

1889
01:56:16,471 --> 01:56:18,630
choosing them. So people, your team,

1890
01:56:18,780 --> 01:56:21,900
people look at you and they judge
you by what your team is like.

1891
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:27,570
And if you surround yourself with people
that are incompetent and incapable,

1892
01:56:28,230 --> 01:56:31,380
that's what people are going to think you.
So use caution.

1893
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:35,000
Next when you see the servant,
uh,

1894
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:41,060
when you see the servant thinking more
of his own interests then of yours and

1895
01:56:41,431 --> 01:56:45,240
seeking inwardly his own
profit and everything,

1896
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:47,670
such a man will never make a good servant,

1897
01:56:47,790 --> 01:56:52,790
nor will you ever be able to trust him
because he who has the state of another

1898
01:56:53,431 --> 01:56:55,920
in his hands ought never think of himself,

1899
01:56:56,130 --> 01:57:01,130
but always have his prints and never pay
any attention to matters in which the

1900
01:57:01,171 --> 01:57:06,150
prince is not concerned. So if you got
someone that's thinking of themselves,

1901
01:57:06,180 --> 01:57:08,550
you cannot trust them.
Yeah.

1902
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:13,860
On the other hand,
to keep his servant honest,

1903
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:17,940
the prince ought to study him,
honoring him, enriching him,

1904
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:21,990
doing him kindness,
sharing with him the honors and cares.

1905
01:57:22,110 --> 01:57:24,930
And at the same time,
let him see that he cannot stand alone.

1906
01:57:25,820 --> 01:57:30,060
So that many honors may not make
him desire more many riches,

1907
01:57:30,061 --> 01:57:34,950
making wish for more. And that many
cares may make him dread chances,

1908
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:39,300
so what's the best way to have loyalty
with someone get treat them really,

1909
01:57:39,301 --> 01:57:41,730
really well. You enrich them. You on rum,

1910
01:57:42,180 --> 01:57:47,180
you share the honors that you get with
that person and then he throw it has to

1911
01:57:48,001 --> 01:57:51,030
throw in a little dig which is you got
to make sure they understand that they're

1912
01:57:51,031 --> 01:57:52,410
not going to get that by themselves.

1913
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:57,420
He always throws a little dig in there a
little bit. He distrust people, you know,

1914
01:57:57,421 --> 01:58:00,530
he says it a bunch of times.
People are scoundrels basically.

1915
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:07,710
Oh important section.
How flatterers should be avoided.

1916
01:58:07,711 --> 01:58:11,340
I did not wish to leave out an important
branch of this subject for it is danger

1917
01:58:11,370 --> 01:58:16,370
for it is a danger from which princes
are with difficulty preserved unless they

1918
01:58:16,501 --> 01:58:19,860
are carefully, unless they are
careful and discriminating.

1919
01:58:20,190 --> 01:58:25,190
It is that of flatterers of those of
whom courts are full because men are so

1920
01:58:26,550 --> 01:58:31,550
self complacent in their own affairs and
in a way so deceived in them that they

1921
01:58:32,461 --> 01:58:35,700
are preserved with difficulty from
the past and if they wish to defend

1922
01:58:35,701 --> 01:58:36,241
themselves,

1923
01:58:36,241 --> 01:58:41,200
they run the danger of falling into
contempt because there is no other way of

1924
01:58:41,201 --> 01:58:46,180
guarding oneself from flatterers except
letting men understand that to tell you

1925
01:58:46,181 --> 01:58:47,770
the truth does not offend you.

1926
01:58:50,460 --> 01:58:52,560
You gotta make sure people understand
that. If you tell me the truth,

1927
01:58:52,561 --> 01:58:56,820
I'm not going to be offended.
But when everyone may tell you the truth,

1928
01:58:56,940 --> 01:58:59,500
respect for you,
a Bates,

1929
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:02,880
then he throws him the little
slumped and little counter, right?

1930
01:59:02,940 --> 01:59:06,480
He doesn't want people talking smack to
him, but he wants me to tell the truth.

1931
01:59:06,990 --> 01:59:07,421
Therefore,

1932
01:59:07,421 --> 01:59:12,240
a wise prince ought to hold a third course
by choosing the wise men in the state

1933
01:59:12,241 --> 01:59:16,140
and giving them only the liberty of
speaking the truth to him and then only of

1934
01:59:16,141 --> 01:59:19,140
those things which he
inquires and have none others.

1935
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:22,280
So you can talk the truth
as long as I ask you before,

1936
01:59:23,640 --> 01:59:26,580
but he ought to question them upon
everything. But even though I say, Hey,

1937
01:59:26,581 --> 01:59:29,010
well you only to echo, you only
tell me the truth when I asked you,

1938
01:59:29,011 --> 01:59:32,640
but I'm going to ask you everything and
listen to their opinions and afterwards

1939
01:59:32,641 --> 01:59:36,870
for form his own conclusions with these
counselors separately and collectively,

1940
01:59:36,871 --> 01:59:40,080
he ought to carry himself in such a way
that each of them should know that the

1941
01:59:40,081 --> 01:59:43,740
more freely he shall speak,
the more he shall be preferred.

1942
01:59:44,970 --> 01:59:47,340
The more you tell me the truth,
the more I'm going to like it.

1943
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:49,440
The Mormon alike you outside of the east,

1944
01:59:49,441 --> 01:59:54,441
he should listen to no one pursue the
thing resolved on and be steadfast in his

1945
01:59:54,991 --> 01:59:55,824
resolutions.

1946
01:59:56,940 --> 02:00:01,940
He who does not otherwise is either
overthrown by flatterers are so often

1947
02:00:02,460 --> 02:00:07,110
changed by varying his opinions
that he falls into contempt.

1948
02:00:10,740 --> 02:00:13,930
He continues on to this thought, a prince
therefore on always to take counsel,

1949
02:00:13,931 --> 02:00:16,240
but only when he wishes
and not when others wish.

1950
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:20,110
He ought to rather discourage everyone
from offering advice unless he asks it.

1951
02:00:20,111 --> 02:00:25,111
But however he ought to be a constant
inquirer and afterwards a patient listener

1952
02:00:26,230 --> 02:00:31,230
concerning the things which
he has inquired also on
learning that anyone or on

1953
02:00:32,321 --> 02:00:35,380
any consideration has
not told him the truth.

1954
02:00:35,530 --> 02:00:38,590
He should let his hangar is anger be felt.

1955
02:00:41,630 --> 02:00:45,050
And if there is someone who thinks that
a prince who conveys an impression of

1956
02:00:45,051 --> 02:00:50,051
his wisdom is not through his own ability
but through good advisors that he has

1957
02:00:50,481 --> 02:00:52,130
around him beyond doubt,

1958
02:00:52,430 --> 02:00:56,840
they are deceived because this
is an axiom which never fails,

1959
02:00:56,960 --> 02:01:00,410
that a prince who is not wise
himself will never take good advice.

1960
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:04,880
So if you look at someone and say,
Oh oh that that CEO is doing a good job,

1961
02:01:04,881 --> 02:01:07,850
but that's because he's got these
guys with them, that's actually wrong.

1962
02:01:08,120 --> 02:01:09,830
The CEO's got that good
personal with them,

1963
02:01:09,860 --> 02:01:13,580
those good people brought them in and
then listens to them. They get credit.

1964
02:01:13,820 --> 02:01:18,740
He gives him credit for that. And you know
what's funny? That's good salesmanship.

1965
02:01:18,741 --> 02:01:19,520
Listen to this.

1966
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:24,470
Therefore it must be inferred that good
councils whatsoever they come are born.

1967
02:01:24,471 --> 02:01:28,880
Of the wisdom of the prince and not the
wisdom of the prints from good counsel.

1968
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:31,940
So he's saying, if you're listening
to what I'm saying right now,

1969
02:01:31,970 --> 02:01:33,080
that makes you good.

1970
02:01:34,100 --> 02:01:37,430
If you listen to this book or you listen
to the words I'm saying and you obey

1971
02:01:37,431 --> 02:01:40,250
him, that makes you great. It
you're not giving credit to me.

1972
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:42,500
You're great if you do. Yeah. What?

1973
02:01:42,501 --> 02:01:47,170
Like you're smart because you're so smart
to listen to the good stuff that you

1974
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:52,220
taking this advice proves that
you're brilliant you. It's like, Hey,

1975
02:01:52,221 --> 02:01:54,770
if you read this book,
it proves that you're smart.

1976
02:01:55,770 --> 02:01:58,170
Just the only a smart
person would be this book.

1977
02:01:59,030 --> 02:02:02,150
Smart person would take the advice of
someone else. That's how smart you are.

1978
02:02:02,900 --> 02:02:07,630
That's like good salesmanship of the book.
Do not let,

1979
02:02:08,090 --> 02:02:11,900
do not let her prints is accused fortune
for the loss of the principalities

1980
02:02:11,901 --> 02:02:16,130
after so many years. Possession. Okay, so
he's saying don't let, don't blame luck.

1981
02:02:16,250 --> 02:02:19,760
Don't blame bad luck when
you lose your principality.

1982
02:02:20,680 --> 02:02:21,760
Don't blame bad luck,

1983
02:02:22,120 --> 02:02:27,120
but rather their own slaw off because
in quiet times they never thought there

1984
02:02:28,421 --> 02:02:29,500
could be a change.

1985
02:02:29,590 --> 02:02:33,910
It is a common defect in man not to make
any provision in the calm against the

1986
02:02:33,911 --> 02:02:36,610
tempest. So it's common that people,
when things aren't going bad,

1987
02:02:36,611 --> 02:02:39,910
they just kicked back the cruise cruise,

1988
02:02:40,420 --> 02:02:43,390
they crews and instead of working

1989
02:02:45,160 --> 02:02:48,010
and when afterwards the bad times came,

1990
02:02:48,130 --> 02:02:51,010
they fought of flight and
not of defending themselves.

1991
02:02:51,011 --> 02:02:55,090
And they hope that the people disgusted
with the insolence of the conquerors.

1992
02:02:55,180 --> 02:02:58,510
Conquerors would recall them. That's a
good plan. Hey, if I get run over run,

1993
02:02:58,511 --> 02:03:02,080
I'll just hope that the conquerors are
so bad that the people rebel and bring me

1994
02:03:02,081 --> 02:03:02,914
back.

1995
02:03:05,260 --> 02:03:08,830
And here he talks about what fortunate
again, he uses fortune like luck.

1996
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:12,490
What fortune can effect in human
affairs and how to withstand her.

1997
02:03:16,070 --> 02:03:17,750
I will hold it to be true.

1998
02:03:17,751 --> 02:03:21,710
That fortune is the arbiter of
about one half of our actions,

1999
02:03:22,610 --> 02:03:27,230
but that she still leaves us to direct
the other half, perhaps a little less.

2000
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:32,240
So he's saying, look, luck has
50% 50% that's a big number.

2001
02:03:32,510 --> 02:03:35,860
Yeah, and you might go, well, if it's
50% man, why even try? Well that's,

2002
02:03:35,870 --> 02:03:38,540
it leaves you 50% in control.
That's actually a lot.

2003
02:03:40,460 --> 02:03:44,450
He goes on, I compare her and he's hers,
yet he's talking about is fortunate.

2004
02:03:44,451 --> 02:03:46,490
I compare her to one
of those raging rivers,

2005
02:03:46,730 --> 02:03:51,730
which when the F in flood overflows the
planes sweeping away trees and buildings

2006
02:03:52,340 --> 02:03:54,860
bearing away the soil from place to place.

2007
02:03:55,010 --> 02:04:00,010
Everything flies before it all yield to
it's violence without being able in any

2008
02:04:00,561 --> 02:04:01,610
way to withstand it.

2009
02:04:02,660 --> 02:04:07,280
And yet though it's nature be such,
it does not follow.

2010
02:04:07,281 --> 02:04:09,950
Therefore,
that man,

2011
02:04:10,010 --> 02:04:15,010
when the weather becomes fair shall not
make provision both with the fences and

2012
02:04:16,491 --> 02:04:19,490
barriers in such a
manner that rising again,

2013
02:04:19,730 --> 02:04:24,730
the waters may pass away by canal and
they're forced be neither so unrestrained

2014
02:04:25,130 --> 02:04:29,420
nor so dangerous. So floods are
real bad and they'll wipe you out.

2015
02:04:29,421 --> 02:04:32,330
But when there's no flood and you can
build walls, you can build barriers,

2016
02:04:32,331 --> 02:04:36,170
you can build canals,
and then you can control that,

2017
02:04:36,290 --> 02:04:41,010
that danger,
that flood continuing on.

2018
02:04:41,011 --> 02:04:45,000
So what happens with fortune,
who shows her power,

2019
02:04:45,120 --> 02:04:50,120
where valor has not prepared to resist
her and thither she turns her forces

2020
02:04:51,931 --> 02:04:56,580
where she knows that barriers and defenses
have not been raised to constrainer.

2021
02:04:56,700 --> 02:05:00,780
So that bad luck, if you don't work
that bad luck's coming at you. Yeah.

2022
02:05:01,320 --> 02:05:02,280
It's common at you.

2023
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:05,330
Kind of like the weather, right?
Remember like how you were saying yes.

2024
02:05:05,331 --> 02:05:09,430
Like it kind of like extreme ownership
almost situation where it's not Kinda,

2025
02:05:09,450 --> 02:05:12,890
it is a straight up, straight
up. Yeah. Like yeah. You know,

2026
02:05:13,220 --> 02:05:18,050
but let's say I put a TV outside
right outside, it'd be cool.

2027
02:05:18,350 --> 02:05:20,060
Um, you know, it doesn't
really rain much here,

2028
02:05:20,061 --> 02:05:23,900
so I don't really need to put on a cover
every day, you know, kind of thing.

2029
02:05:23,960 --> 02:05:27,590
And then sure enough, the one day
out of the year it rains on your TV,

2030
02:05:27,740 --> 02:05:31,820
no more TV scene was saying, but if
you would have prepared properly. Yeah.

2031
02:05:31,880 --> 02:05:34,760
Even though it's sunny, you just
keep the cover on anyway, you know,

2032
02:05:34,761 --> 02:05:39,670
just in case it rains. Good one.
Yeah. Yeah. That's, you know,

2033
02:05:40,160 --> 02:05:42,260
to me that was the perfect example.
You know,

2034
02:05:42,310 --> 02:05:45,290
I think there's a majority of people
will find that. Perfect example,

2035
02:05:47,130 --> 02:05:51,380
one last, last little thing to close
this out and he goes into some, um,

2036
02:05:51,870 --> 02:05:56,870
some more kind of historical
documentation and examples,

2037
02:05:58,830 --> 02:06:02,460
but this was a good one. So I just
wanted to close it out with this.

2038
02:06:02,461 --> 02:06:07,461
A prince may be seen happy today and
ruined tomorrow without having shown any

2039
02:06:09,361 --> 02:06:11,790
change of disposition or character.

2040
02:06:13,750 --> 02:06:15,760
And what that's saying is normal face,

2041
02:06:16,750 --> 02:06:20,290
you just need to keep like regardless,
things are going great,

2042
02:06:20,291 --> 02:06:23,550
things are going bad, guess what?
We're sticking with normal. No,

2043
02:06:23,980 --> 02:06:25,330
that's how we're sticking.
Hmm.

2044
02:06:26,950 --> 02:06:30,490
And that wraps up the book
again a ton to think about.

2045
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:33,110
A ton that does.
There's,

2046
02:06:33,190 --> 02:06:37,320
there's definitely parts of it that
match kind of the traditional Mackey and

2047
02:06:37,330 --> 02:06:39,640
valley machiavellian.

2048
02:06:41,530 --> 02:06:42,363
Okay.

2049
02:06:42,440 --> 02:06:46,880
Common perception. And there's
plenty of it that goes against it.

2050
02:06:47,690 --> 02:06:52,690
And I believe the right answer is balance
and it's more balanced than people

2051
02:06:53,571 --> 02:06:58,280
think it is. Yeah. But speaking of,

2052
02:06:58,400 --> 02:06:58,760
you know,

2053
02:06:58,760 --> 02:07:03,760
bolstering up our defenses against
the whims of fortune or misfortune,

2054
02:07:05,540 --> 02:07:08,870
you know, do you have any maybe
suggestions on how we could

2055
02:07:09,670 --> 02:07:14,170
sure bolster and prepare for that a yeah.
Yeah,

2056
02:07:14,171 --> 02:07:18,730
a few ways. Uh, well, back to the
book real quick in, so let's say,

2057
02:07:18,731 --> 02:07:23,160
to sort of sum up what,
what is a way to sum up

2058
02:07:24,350 --> 02:07:28,160
Macchia Vallian ways? Well,
like I said, the, the,

2059
02:07:28,670 --> 02:07:33,260
the traditional understanding and
meaning of the word Machiavellian is a

2060
02:07:33,261 --> 02:07:37,660
negative. It means, hey, this person's
under handed. They're going to deceive.

2061
02:07:37,661 --> 02:07:40,570
They're not going to care what kind of
destruction they leave in their path.

2062
02:07:40,990 --> 02:07:44,050
That's what people think of it.
Like I said, if, if you say, hey,

2063
02:07:44,051 --> 02:07:47,290
this person's a machiavellian
leader. Everyone thinks, okay,

2064
02:07:47,291 --> 02:07:48,700
they're going to be merciless.

2065
02:07:48,730 --> 02:07:50,740
They're going to just run
rough shot over everyone.

2066
02:07:50,741 --> 02:07:54,580
They don't care who they step on to
get to rise to power. That's the truth.

2067
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:57,070
That's the truth.
That's what the word actually means.

2068
02:07:57,310 --> 02:08:00,460
But we just gave example after example.

2069
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:06,000
It's not that cut and dry
and he definitely introduces
many dichotomies to to

2070
02:08:08,621 --> 02:08:12,370
that idea that you're just going to do
whatever it takes to get to the top.

2071
02:08:12,720 --> 02:08:17,720
He talks a lot about these other more
moderate and important things that you

2072
02:08:18,371 --> 02:08:20,800
need to do as a leader to get,

2073
02:08:20,801 --> 02:08:24,370
not only to get in a position to
but to stay in position. So being,

2074
02:08:24,430 --> 02:08:26,020
having good relationships
with your people,

2075
02:08:26,021 --> 02:08:27,550
making sure they understand
where you're coming from.

2076
02:08:27,551 --> 02:08:30,610
Like these things are not
considered when you hear the word,

2077
02:08:30,611 --> 02:08:33,280
when you don't know any better and you
just take the word for what the word has

2078
02:08:33,281 --> 02:08:37,240
become, demean what the word means.
Now machiavellian is like, Hey,

2079
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:39,700
I will stop at nothing to rise to the top.

2080
02:08:40,660 --> 02:08:45,520
And that's one of the reasons why I wanted
to cover this, because even with that,

2081
02:08:45,521 --> 02:08:49,510
even though he definitely leans in that
direction and he, he, what he's saying is,

2082
02:08:49,511 --> 02:08:50,344
look,
sometimes you gotta,

2083
02:08:50,350 --> 02:08:53,370
sometimes you gotta stab or somebody in
the back occasionally and then you've

2084
02:08:53,371 --> 02:08:55,750
got to cover it up to the best of
your ability. That's what he says.

2085
02:08:56,350 --> 02:09:00,220
I don't believe that. I believe in, when
you stab someone in the back, that person,

2086
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:03,400
they may die, but they got a, they
got a friend, they got a brother,

2087
02:09:03,401 --> 02:09:05,290
they got someone else.
I got someone else's you don't know,

2088
02:09:05,291 --> 02:09:08,470
you don't recognize and at some point
they're going to come and get you.

2089
02:09:09,550 --> 02:09:14,410
So you have to, you know, you have
to try and balance these dichotomies.

2090
02:09:14,411 --> 02:09:15,580
You have to try and,

2091
02:09:15,581 --> 02:09:18,670
and that's not even balancing a dichotomy
that's just straight up like, hey,

2092
02:09:18,820 --> 02:09:21,430
you got to take,
you've got to treat people,

2093
02:09:22,890 --> 02:09:26,560
you got to respect people and you've
got to not always look out for your own

2094
02:09:26,561 --> 02:09:29,530
good.
And what I will tell you and what I know,

2095
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:32,920
the more you look out for your own good,
and this is where,

2096
02:09:32,950 --> 02:09:34,450
this is probably the biggest dichotomy,

2097
02:09:34,510 --> 02:09:36,550
dichotomy with this
machiavellian attitude.

2098
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:41,080
The more you look out for your own good,
the worst off you're going to be.

2099
02:09:41,950 --> 02:09:44,740
And the more you look out for the good
of others and the more you look out for

2100
02:09:44,741 --> 02:09:46,750
your team and the more you
put the mission and your,

2101
02:09:46,810 --> 02:09:50,590
and your people ahead of yourself, the
better off you'll end up in the long run.

2102
02:09:50,770 --> 02:09:55,770
So that's in complete contrast to what
the Makaveli and the common thought about

2103
02:09:56,831 --> 02:10:01,060
being machiavellian. And I, and I will
tell you, when I work with companies,

2104
02:10:01,210 --> 02:10:03,250
the leaders that put their
people ahead of them,

2105
02:10:03,251 --> 02:10:06,670
the leaders that put there that put
the mission ahead of themselves,

2106
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:09,040
they're always respected.
They're always,

2107
02:10:10,300 --> 02:10:13,570
they're always loved by the troops.

2108
02:10:13,870 --> 02:10:18,010
They always have support of the troops
and they always go forward and do a good

2109
02:10:18,011 --> 02:10:22,210
job. The people that screw the
people over, screw the team over,

2110
02:10:22,330 --> 02:10:24,880
put themselves ahead,
their egos, those people,

2111
02:10:24,970 --> 02:10:29,650
those leaders never end up
doing well in the long run.

2112
02:10:29,680 --> 02:10:31,750
Sometimes you can do some
short term stuff, right? Hey,

2113
02:10:31,751 --> 02:10:33,890
I'm going to screw echo over them to
get promoted because I'm going to,

2114
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:36,300
you know, fill out a report
that he didn't, you know,

2115
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:39,920
the government to rat him out on this
thing. Okay, cool. I rat you out.

2116
02:10:39,980 --> 02:10:43,100
But what I don't realize is that you
have another friend that's with us.

2117
02:10:43,350 --> 02:10:45,450
That's that you'd, that's your peer. Yeah.

2118
02:10:45,650 --> 02:10:49,850
And now he's watching me and there's
going to be competency for him to rat me

2119
02:10:49,851 --> 02:10:53,840
out cause I miss something
or I didn't do something.

2120
02:10:54,470 --> 02:10:57,470
So if you form good relationships,

2121
02:10:57,680 --> 02:11:02,680
if you put your team and your mission
and you put others above yourself,

2122
02:11:02,930 --> 02:11:06,590
you're going to end up in a much better
position than you will stabbing people

2123
02:11:06,591 --> 02:11:10,730
in the back and stepping on people to try
and rise to the top. And not only that,

2124
02:11:10,731 --> 02:11:14,540
when you get to the top,
you will be much more comfortable,

2125
02:11:14,541 --> 02:11:16,310
not only when you look
yourself in the mirror,

2126
02:11:16,730 --> 02:11:21,320
but also when you get to the top and you
know that the people below you in the

2127
02:11:21,321 --> 02:11:25,160
chain of command actually want you there
and actually will do anything to defend

2128
02:11:25,161 --> 02:11:26,090
your position up there.

2129
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:29,570
That's a lot more comfortable than having
to constantly look behind your back

2130
02:11:29,571 --> 02:11:34,400
and see who's sneaking up behind you.
So do the right thing for the right thing.

2131
02:11:34,850 --> 02:11:37,610
Be Good leader. Yeah, keyword is good.

2132
02:11:38,030 --> 02:11:40,040
So kind of in a way it
kind of goes along well.

2133
02:11:40,070 --> 02:11:44,350
Really does go along with kind
of what you say were like,

2134
02:11:45,060 --> 02:11:45,831
so okay,

2135
02:11:45,831 --> 02:11:50,600
machiavellian way traditionally whatever
could be put simply maybe over simply

2136
02:11:50,601 --> 02:11:54,500
but simply, you know, looking
out for yourself. Totally.
You know, kind of thing.

2137
02:11:54,560 --> 02:11:59,560
Look out from what you say and what he
ends up saying is the best way to look

2138
02:11:59,781 --> 02:12:02,180
out for yourself to look up for the piece.

2139
02:12:02,630 --> 02:12:06,170
Always talking about the people and
people don't get the people. So man,

2140
02:12:06,171 --> 02:12:08,030
it's kind of brings it
full circle in a way.

2141
02:12:08,060 --> 02:12:12,140
It does bring it full circle and the
full circle answer is take care of your

2142
02:12:12,141 --> 02:12:14,810
people, take care of your team,
look out for other people.

2143
02:12:14,810 --> 02:12:18,830
Don't put yourself first. Yeah. If you do
that, you're going to end up, you might,

2144
02:12:18,831 --> 02:12:21,020
like I said,
you might end up stepping up for a moment,

2145
02:12:21,170 --> 02:12:24,380
but in the long run things
aren't going to go your way.

2146
02:12:24,410 --> 02:12:25,760
And even when you are on the top,

2147
02:12:25,761 --> 02:12:28,430
you're going to be waiting
to get stabbed in the back.

2148
02:12:29,450 --> 02:12:31,400
Not Fun always in.
The more,

2149
02:12:31,430 --> 02:12:35,260
more I think of a new kind of turned me
on to the whole idea of the long game.

2150
02:12:36,290 --> 02:12:39,890
The more I kind of opened my
eyes to like look at things.

2151
02:12:39,950 --> 02:12:44,090
It kind of seems like playing the
short game isn't the smart game.

2152
02:12:44,210 --> 02:12:46,880
It's totally ignorant.
Yeah. The short game.

2153
02:12:46,881 --> 02:12:51,440
So when you figure it and you can see
it to where it's so obvious when people

2154
02:12:51,441 --> 02:12:55,610
are playing the short game.
We, yeah. With everything.
With everything. Yeah. In fact,

2155
02:12:55,880 --> 02:13:00,590
if you identify any one of your failures
or the failures of others, whatever,

2156
02:13:00,591 --> 02:13:04,190
but try your own.
If you identify any one of them,

2157
02:13:05,040 --> 02:13:09,690
you'll probably trace it down to your
playing the short game in regards to that.

2158
02:13:09,720 --> 02:13:13,700
Many times you're overweight or whatever
you're playing the short game as far as

2159
02:13:13,701 --> 02:13:14,690
like what you eat,

2160
02:13:14,691 --> 02:13:17,060
what you're doing physically or
whatever you playing short during.

2161
02:13:17,061 --> 02:13:21,020
You can go to the short term payoff
rather than the big long term. Big. Yeah.

2162
02:13:21,290 --> 02:13:25,340
So if you can maintain that in your mind,
I think play the long game,

2163
02:13:25,670 --> 02:13:28,100
he'd be doing some good stuff.
Yeah. My opinion, it's a,

2164
02:13:28,101 --> 02:13:32,520
it's a weird dichotomy that if you really
want to do well yourself and the best

2165
02:13:32,521 --> 02:13:34,900
thing you can do is take care of,
you know,

2166
02:13:35,020 --> 02:13:38,310
you're being someone who's not yourself.
Yeah, exactly. It's a dichotomy,

2167
02:13:38,490 --> 02:13:40,860
but it's the reality. It's, it's a,

2168
02:13:40,870 --> 02:13:43,410
it's a nice little blessing that
you get at the end of the day for,

2169
02:13:43,530 --> 02:13:45,780
for trying to take care of people.
They'll take care of you,

2170
02:13:46,130 --> 02:13:50,220
you take care of people, they'll take
care of you. Then to go one step further,

2171
02:13:50,310 --> 02:13:54,420
if you take care of yourself and give
yourself the capability of the Kate,

2172
02:13:54,450 --> 02:13:58,260
take care of more people seem to saying
so. It's like this never ending. Well,

2173
02:13:58,261 --> 02:14:00,570
if you take care of, if you
looked at this, this is the, no,

2174
02:14:00,571 --> 02:14:02,340
this is the opposite of what I just said.

2175
02:14:02,580 --> 02:14:07,470
The opposite of what I just said is if
you take care of yourself as the primary

2176
02:14:07,690 --> 02:14:07,950
right,

2177
02:14:07,950 --> 02:14:11,040
you will end up being in a worse position
than if you try and take care of other

2178
02:14:11,041 --> 02:14:14,520
people. Yeah. That's the,
that's the reality. So if I'm,

2179
02:14:14,580 --> 02:14:16,170
if I'm always looking out for me,
if I,

2180
02:14:16,200 --> 02:14:20,010
if I act in the traditional
machiavellian way,

2181
02:14:20,610 --> 02:14:25,110
sure I might get a head right now I might
step on am I get a short term win here

2182
02:14:25,111 --> 02:14:29,670
and their longterm I will not be
in a better position long term.

2183
02:14:29,671 --> 02:14:32,600
I will be in a worse position.
Yeah. That's the way it is. Yeah.

2184
02:14:32,610 --> 02:14:35,970
I was thinking more, you know, the
oxygen mask in the plane, you know,

2185
02:14:35,971 --> 02:14:38,010
put it on yourself before your
kids kind of thing. But you know,

2186
02:14:38,190 --> 02:14:40,230
it's a tall thing,
nevermind.

2187
02:14:41,340 --> 02:14:43,590
But every once in a while,

2188
02:14:43,950 --> 02:14:47,880
every once in a while you can find
something that has both a short term and a

2189
02:14:47,881 --> 02:14:50,850
long term payoff.
Jujitsu is one of those things.

2190
02:14:52,170 --> 02:14:52,470
Okay.

2191
02:14:52,470 --> 02:14:54,900
Short term,
longterm indeed big time.

2192
02:14:58,020 --> 02:15:03,000
Are there sacrifices? Why wouldn't you
take Jujitsu? And I'm not saying like,

2193
02:15:03,060 --> 02:15:05,080
Oh you know you, I'm just
saying what are, what are.

2194
02:15:05,081 --> 02:15:08,850
So in general I don't have time,
number one. Number two, there's all,

2195
02:15:08,900 --> 02:15:10,950
then we want you,
once you get past that one,

2196
02:15:11,160 --> 02:15:16,160
it's just a whole array of
reasons I might get hurt.

2197
02:15:16,830 --> 02:15:20,430
I don't like,
I feel claustrophobic,

2198
02:15:20,431 --> 02:15:23,670
which by the way is an even more reason
to do it because you should be trying to

2199
02:15:23,671 --> 02:15:28,290
overcome that. Um, what, what other
yeah, she uses general intimidation,

2200
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:33,900
intimidation or whatever. Yeah.
I don't try something new.

2201
02:15:33,930 --> 02:15:37,120
That's kind of like a big thing.
Scary. Yeah. It's scary. I'm scared.

2202
02:15:38,130 --> 02:15:41,580
Need to read Mikey and the
dragons, but go ahead. Nonetheless,

2203
02:15:41,670 --> 02:15:46,560
if when we see fit to start Jujitsu,

2204
02:15:46,590 --> 02:15:50,790
if we haven't started already,
you're going to need a g and a rash card.

2205
02:15:52,870 --> 02:15:56,170
Maybe some other stuff. No. G and
a rash guard. Perfect. Yeah. Yeah.

2206
02:15:56,180 --> 02:15:58,690
The school and then, yeah, the academy or,

2207
02:15:58,691 --> 02:16:03,560
or at least some mats and a friend
or at least a friend at these.

2208
02:16:03,580 --> 02:16:06,130
Okay. Okay. Yeah. Better
than nothing for sure.

2209
02:16:06,250 --> 02:16:11,030
But when you get the g and people, yes.
People still ask what kind of, Gee,

2210
02:16:11,031 --> 02:16:15,550
should I get? Just started. What
kind of origin? G from origin,

2211
02:16:15,880 --> 02:16:20,230
origin, main.com. This is where you
can browse as many Giza as you want.

2212
02:16:20,590 --> 02:16:24,910
Get more than one. Um,
best keys. Factually.

2213
02:16:24,911 --> 02:16:29,911
The best keys made in America
from beginning to made in America.

2214
02:16:30,250 --> 02:16:35,050
Getting to the end of the whole process
designed by people that do Jujitsu.

2215
02:16:35,330 --> 02:16:37,810
Yup.
Not by a random person that doesn't train,

2216
02:16:38,410 --> 02:16:42,340
not by a person that looked an
Ikea Yogi and said, oh yeah,

2217
02:16:42,341 --> 02:16:46,570
well that's no Ughi. That's
a person that says, oh shit,

2218
02:16:46,660 --> 02:16:50,840
I do Jujitsu daily and I need
to make the best possibility.

2219
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:53,920
I compete in Jujitsu and I'm going
to make the best possible gay.

2220
02:16:54,250 --> 02:16:56,960
That's where you get there. That's
where you get the origin. Geetha boom.

2221
02:16:56,980 --> 02:17:01,030
There you go. You're welcome. And then
we're going to make it in America. Yeah.

2222
02:17:01,960 --> 02:17:03,730
I wish I knew that
before I bought my first,

2223
02:17:03,940 --> 02:17:08,770
my first Gig I bought from the academy.
Did I buy it from the get it? Yeah.

2224
02:17:08,830 --> 02:17:12,110
How about it from the Academy
of the boxing club? Yeah.

2225
02:17:12,580 --> 02:17:15,310
It was the worst guy ever had ever.
And here's the thing,

2226
02:17:15,370 --> 02:17:19,090
and that's what these are
like. Yes, no, I didn't know.

2227
02:17:19,091 --> 02:17:22,540
So then I bought like I went
and I saw one from a guy,

2228
02:17:22,541 --> 02:17:25,840
a guy had one on and I was like, oh,
that looks cool. The logo look school.

2229
02:17:25,841 --> 02:17:28,710
Even when I felt that, I was like,
Ooh, that looks, feels beefy.

2230
02:17:29,500 --> 02:17:32,770
I went and got mine and it was like it
shrunk a little bit too much and it was

2231
02:17:32,771 --> 02:17:36,680
like it didn't fit that
good. He was like, uh.

2232
02:17:37,150 --> 02:17:41,980
There were some scenarios where it felt
like a straight jacket and which you

2233
02:17:41,981 --> 02:17:43,780
know, it depends on who you are, whatever,

2234
02:17:43,781 --> 02:17:47,800
but it was just so thick and maybe
might've been too small. I don't know.

2235
02:17:47,830 --> 02:17:51,670
But nonetheless, no one pointed me in the
right direction. That's the point. Yes.

2236
02:17:51,671 --> 02:17:54,310
Now you're being told, so
now, now you are telling,

2237
02:17:54,620 --> 02:17:57,520
telling some don't want to
be in a straight jacket. No,

2238
02:17:57,521 --> 02:18:00,940
you don't want to be in a
very comfortable, comfortable,

2239
02:18:00,941 --> 02:18:04,960
which you are highly skilled at assessing.

2240
02:18:04,961 --> 02:18:09,160
Coming from lionizing is big time,
but here's the thing. In Jujitsu,

2241
02:18:09,161 --> 02:18:11,910
if the g is comfortable, that's
a good thing. I mean, hey,

2242
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:14,200
if you're some weirdo savage who's like,
you know what?

2243
02:18:14,201 --> 02:18:18,190
That's going to be part of my training
to put on an uncomfortable gete and

2244
02:18:18,520 --> 02:18:23,200
hardened my mind. There was this whole
fish to train with a wetsuit under.

2245
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:26,560
His gig was for discomfort level.
Dar Tanium.

2246
02:18:26,770 --> 02:18:30,220
He's still a Jujitsu guy is out there.
He was like Higgs Higgs.

2247
02:18:30,221 --> 02:18:34,570
His training partners. Birkin.
Yeah, but he's still out there.

2248
02:18:34,720 --> 02:18:39,370
So is that Kinda like the the guys
who were the restrict oxygen mask?

2249
02:18:39,970 --> 02:18:41,800
Well,
you don't put on a wetsuit very often,

2250
02:18:41,950 --> 02:18:46,060
but ever wetsuits are slightly,
especially this is,

2251
02:18:46,150 --> 02:18:49,840
this is 20 years ago that that this guy
was putting on a wetsuit and training

2252
02:18:50,440 --> 02:18:52,090
and wetsuits have come a long way.

2253
02:18:52,091 --> 02:18:54,610
They're much more comfortable
now and much more pliable,

2254
02:18:55,310 --> 02:19:00,160
but back in the day we would put on a
three millimeter wetsuit. It was, it was,

2255
02:19:00,190 --> 02:19:02,290
it was restricting your mobility.

2256
02:19:02,410 --> 02:19:05,260
So just do that and train and be
hot and sweaty and uncomfortable.

2257
02:19:05,530 --> 02:19:08,770
That's next level.
Put a wetsuit on underneath your origin.

2258
02:19:09,430 --> 02:19:12,970
Want more discomfort. There's your,
there's your answer. Oh, right.

2259
02:19:12,971 --> 02:19:16,600
If you're training for that,
I say 100% don't do that.

2260
02:19:16,780 --> 02:19:19,510
That's what I would recommend. No,
I know you wouldn't recommend that,

2261
02:19:19,600 --> 02:19:22,020
but it is kind of hardcore.
It is hardcore. I,

2262
02:19:22,021 --> 02:19:26,290
there's a certain legitimate level of
respect I have for [inaudible] or doing

2263
02:19:26,291 --> 02:19:30,440
that thing. That's Kinda,
he's out there man in Jujitsu.

2264
02:19:30,470 --> 02:19:35,080
Just strong as hell. Just
wearing a wetsuit. Good. Amen.

2265
02:19:35,690 --> 02:19:39,050
Legit league. There's other
stuff at origin to, yeah,

2266
02:19:39,170 --> 02:19:43,820
like t shirts and sweatshirts and,
and by the way,

2267
02:19:45,290 --> 02:19:49,760
we're going to have jeans. We have
jeans right now while we do well I do,

2268
02:19:49,960 --> 02:19:52,940
cause I, I last time I looked, I
don't know. You don't have a break.

2269
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,520
You will get some soon.
But anyways,

2270
02:19:55,970 --> 02:20:00,620
just like the Biggie is awesome.

2271
02:20:01,850 --> 02:20:05,600
Here's the problem with a g,
you can't wear a geek to the store.

2272
02:20:06,050 --> 02:20:09,560
You can't wear a Geeky to the
restaurant when you can't technically,

2273
02:20:09,770 --> 02:20:14,300
but you wouldn't do that. So, you
know, talking to Pete, I'm like, Pete,

2274
02:20:14,420 --> 02:20:17,330
I love, I love my origin. Geese.

2275
02:20:17,690 --> 02:20:22,370
I will in origin g around the house
maybe a little bit, right? I said, Pete,

2276
02:20:22,670 --> 02:20:26,840
I can't go out. I need, I need, I need
jeans. I need something. And jeans.

2277
02:20:26,841 --> 02:20:29,210
Guess what you can do in jeans.
We're up to the restaurant.

2278
02:20:29,420 --> 02:20:32,990
You can wear them anywhere. You can swing
a hammer. When you're wearing jeans,

2279
02:20:33,050 --> 02:20:34,970
you can pour concrete.
When you're wearing jeans,

2280
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:38,360
you can go to a restaurant when
you're wearing jeans or Jean jeans,

2281
02:20:38,480 --> 02:20:42,710
origin genes coming
very soon.

2282
02:20:43,160 --> 02:20:46,820
We will have them available on the website

2283
02:20:48,410 --> 02:20:51,740
to preorder where I think we're going to
be like a preorder thing just cause we

2284
02:20:51,741 --> 02:20:54,290
want to know how many to make.
But yeah.

2285
02:20:54,460 --> 02:20:57,860
Then we'll just start making them as
fast as we can. So made in America, uh,

2286
02:20:57,920 --> 02:21:02,540
what the denim without compromise,
the buttons.

2287
02:21:02,630 --> 02:21:04,820
American. Wait, what are
those things called that you,

2288
02:21:04,910 --> 02:21:09,290
that you fastened at the top of the
genes buttons. The buttons. They will,

2289
02:21:09,880 --> 02:21:11,450
the bras are made in America.

2290
02:21:11,451 --> 02:21:16,451
Everything's made in America and they're
sewn up in Maine by serious craftsmen.

2291
02:21:17,870 --> 02:21:21,910
Legit crafts, crafts people. Yeah.

2292
02:21:22,640 --> 02:21:25,640
American denim.
Then straight up bringing it back,

2293
02:21:25,670 --> 02:21:30,600
bringing it back or gin main
origin may doll supplements

2294
02:21:34,660 --> 02:21:37,080
because you're on the program right
now. Back on the program. My art,

2295
02:21:37,100 --> 02:21:38,070
like come back in Jujitsu.

2296
02:21:38,180 --> 02:21:41,930
My arm is healed but it's like really
susceptible to tendonitis, you know,

2297
02:21:41,931 --> 02:21:43,780
like this kind of,
especially with a twisting stuff.

2298
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:47,960
I don't know if I'm ready for like any
kind of legitimate d situation. But,

2299
02:21:48,380 --> 02:21:53,150
so after training you get stiff by just
pound joint warfare, Krill oil, whatever.

2300
02:21:53,390 --> 02:21:58,110
Next day I'm like, cool. But the day
after that good to go man. It's like,

2301
02:21:58,570 --> 02:22:02,070
it's amazing nonetheless.
But yes, joint warfare,

2302
02:22:02,210 --> 02:22:06,470
joint warfare is what it is for
your joints. Keeps it together.

2303
02:22:08,120 --> 02:22:12,260
Krill oil, same deal discipline.
Just I've been on the discipline.

2304
02:22:12,360 --> 02:22:15,020
You drew a little bit,
you said to me like,

2305
02:22:15,170 --> 02:22:19,430
cause yesterday I turned kind of and
that Jujitsu and you said you were asking

2306
02:22:19,431 --> 02:22:23,660
me what kind of Jujitsu training feels
best and then you named a couple times a

2307
02:22:23,661 --> 02:22:27,270
couple different types and then one
them you said was like a three scoop of

2308
02:22:27,271 --> 02:22:31,530
discipline day level.
Like the highest level.

2309
02:22:31,531 --> 02:22:33,540
That was the highest
level of good Jujitsu Day.

2310
02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:36,450
It was three scoops of discipline.
Yeah. Which by the way,

2311
02:22:36,451 --> 02:22:39,780
you can get in tropic thunder
flavor now. Yeah, I'm on that.

2312
02:22:39,810 --> 02:22:42,990
We're waiting for a cease and
desist level letter from uh,

2313
02:22:43,710 --> 02:22:47,070
from Jack Black who is in tropic thunder.

2314
02:22:47,190 --> 02:22:50,020
Robert Downey Jr and Robert Downey Jr.
Yeah.

2315
02:22:50,030 --> 02:22:54,930
And bench still stiller.
Well until then,

2316
02:22:55,500 --> 02:22:59,820
until then, we're just going to
make it tropic thunder. It's good.

2317
02:22:59,910 --> 02:23:04,910
I actually liked that flavor very much
and I like the uh,

2318
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:09,330
you know, the cognitive enhancement.
Some star, I'm just do the three.

2319
02:23:09,390 --> 02:23:12,280
I'm going to try the three and back on
the program and do the three Oh three

2320
02:23:12,281 --> 02:23:16,730
scoops of disagree. Scoop two
scoops the other day. It's good.

2321
02:23:16,890 --> 02:23:21,660
Liked it. What day? Paid off
Wednesday. Okay. What about
Sunday? Yeah, Sunday. Sunday.

2322
02:23:21,661 --> 02:23:22,950
So the other day,
Sunday a little bit.

2323
02:23:25,980 --> 02:23:29,970
I sensed a little bit of urgency.

2324
02:23:30,970 --> 02:23:32,790
Yes. He made me move.
I was pretty impressed.

2325
02:23:32,791 --> 02:23:34,800
It's actually the best I can
hope for right now. But Hey,

2326
02:23:34,801 --> 02:23:38,670
we're doing it one step at a time.
You know, we're moving forward. Also,

2327
02:23:38,760 --> 02:23:42,090
if you want some additional
protein in addition to your steak,

2328
02:23:42,210 --> 02:23:45,020
steak or Sushi,
whatever,

2329
02:23:45,350 --> 02:23:49,100
whatever your Gig is,
drink milk,

2330
02:23:49,620 --> 02:23:53,190
drink it every day if you
have to. Okay. I have,

2331
02:23:53,310 --> 02:23:55,600
I have talked about this before,
but I stepped it up. Okay.

2332
02:23:55,620 --> 02:23:59,610
So you can also get warrior kid milk,
which is for kids. It's got, it's,

2333
02:24:00,120 --> 02:24:02,400
it's the best possible
thing you can feed a kid.

2334
02:24:02,760 --> 02:24:07,760
They edited this out when a tie was down
doing the the the week in the life of

2335
02:24:08,401 --> 02:24:09,320
Jocko.
Sure.

2336
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:14,820
I was like I said something
along the lines of, hey,

2337
02:24:14,821 --> 02:24:18,960
when you're feeding your kids,
when you're feeding your kids a soda,

2338
02:24:19,020 --> 02:24:20,250
that's child abuse.

2339
02:24:20,250 --> 02:24:25,250
I was going off but so that's why I
made work at some warrior couldn't walk

2340
02:24:25,440 --> 02:24:30,440
because I have a bunch of kids myself
and it's really hard to get kids to eat

2341
02:24:30,781 --> 02:24:35,100
good food because either you don't have
time to prepare it or you're running

2342
02:24:35,101 --> 02:24:39,760
late or you whatever or so we
made warrior kid mark. Yeah.

2343
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:44,160
Here's the thing, it tastes delicious.
Here's what I did yesterday. My daughter,

2344
02:24:44,670 --> 02:24:48,720
she was making her dessert strawberries.

2345
02:24:49,980 --> 02:24:52,230
I said, here, let me, cause
she usually takes strawberries.

2346
02:24:52,231 --> 02:24:55,560
She puts a whipped cream on it and then
she sprinkles wore your kid mark on the

2347
02:24:55,561 --> 02:24:58,530
top, like a little
dusting. It's really good.

2348
02:24:59,280 --> 02:25:01,230
We had no whip cream
yesterday. So I said, hey,

2349
02:25:01,231 --> 02:25:03,870
we got some heavy whipping
cream and I've done this before,

2350
02:25:03,871 --> 02:25:06,360
but I actually got the tool out.

2351
02:25:06,361 --> 02:25:10,470
The proper mixing tool that spins
real fast. What's it called?

2352
02:25:11,340 --> 02:25:12,420
Well there's a bunch of them,

2353
02:25:12,421 --> 02:25:15,840
but the one that I am familiar with
is called the magic wand. Okay.

2354
02:25:15,841 --> 02:25:18,990
Mine wasn't that or no,
this is like an oil that's electric.

2355
02:25:19,340 --> 02:25:20,550
It wasn't gas powered,

2356
02:25:21,150 --> 02:25:25,300
but it just like the traditional thing
that you saw in the 50s a little two

2357
02:25:25,301 --> 02:25:29,130
little things that spin together
and yeah, like an egg. Okay.

2358
02:25:29,230 --> 02:25:30,610
So I'm sitting there with the egg beater.

2359
02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:35,640
So I put in heavy whipping cream and then
I put two scoops of Strawberry Warrior

2360
02:25:40,120 --> 02:25:44,770
kid milk. Whipped it,
dude. It's ridiculous.

2361
02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:48,880
It's completely ridiculous. And then,
and then put that on strawberry jam.

2362
02:25:48,881 --> 02:25:51,910
It's like a whipped cream. It's
like whip cream, whip cream.

2363
02:25:52,180 --> 02:25:53,980
So this is a whole nother thing.

2364
02:25:54,100 --> 02:25:58,210
This might start a whole nother sort of
cultural revolution in this nation from

2365
02:25:58,211 --> 02:26:02,560
our children when they are eating
warrior kid and whipped milk cream.

2366
02:26:02,890 --> 02:26:07,090
It's amazing. So anyways, give
that a try. Interesting that.

2367
02:26:07,960 --> 02:26:11,550
Yeah, the egg beater. Well
the man, you know what the
magic wand is? It's, it's not,

2368
02:26:11,680 --> 02:26:15,600
it's like maybe from the 80s. It's
like a, it looks like, Oh yeah,

2369
02:26:15,610 --> 02:26:20,280
you just stick it in your drink.
You can make like mail or whatever.

2370
02:26:20,680 --> 02:26:23,620
But from what I understand,
I dunno. Nonetheless,

2371
02:26:24,050 --> 02:26:28,210
it would have been interesting to imagine
you with one of those cause it is kind

2372
02:26:28,211 --> 02:26:30,460
of a dainty apparatus.

2373
02:26:30,490 --> 02:26:35,490
So get some of that and get some of
that milk for your self or your children

2374
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:39,160
both fall on origin main.com.

2375
02:26:39,610 --> 02:26:42,760
Also Jocko has a store,
it's called Jocko store,

2376
02:26:43,290 --> 02:26:44,800
Jocko store.com.

2377
02:26:44,830 --> 02:26:49,330
So this is where he can get more rash
guard rash guards that represent the path

2378
02:26:49,590 --> 02:26:53,260
and put a new rash guard on there.
Kind of obvious ones saying, uh,

2379
02:26:53,380 --> 02:26:57,690
stand by to get some because
it applies to Jujitsu anyway,

2380
02:26:57,820 --> 02:26:58,470
some new stuff.

2381
02:26:58,470 --> 02:27:01,660
I was wearing a rash guard when I was
working out this morning when I was,

2382
02:27:05,020 --> 02:27:09,070
when I do, uh, when I do a lot of
ring work, when I'm using the rings,

2383
02:27:09,490 --> 02:27:11,400
sometimes you know, you get
the chafe going on, right?

2384
02:27:12,190 --> 02:27:17,190
There's the straps on sometimes on this
particular day and I did have a rash

2385
02:27:17,561 --> 02:27:21,220
guard on this morning.
Good. Also t shirts,

2386
02:27:21,460 --> 02:27:23,740
shirts on there represent truckers,

2387
02:27:23,741 --> 02:27:27,550
hats and flex fit by the way or beanies.

2388
02:27:28,720 --> 02:27:33,550
Sure. Check patches on there. I know
we were out of patches. We were,

2389
02:27:33,710 --> 02:27:37,060
oh, okay. Sorry. I should have
done a better job of paying
attention to that. Yeah,

2390
02:27:37,061 --> 02:27:41,100
no, no, no, no. It was my fault
in not enough completely my fault.

2391
02:27:41,260 --> 02:27:43,630
This is what I'm going to do
to rectify or did more patches.

2392
02:27:43,631 --> 02:27:47,200
We got more patches in
at this time.

2393
02:27:47,860 --> 02:27:50,560
Also some women's stuff on there,
some hoodies on there.

2394
02:27:51,160 --> 02:27:56,160
It's basically if you want to represent
the path that you're on that we're on.

2395
02:27:58,900 --> 02:28:00,910
Boom. That's where you
can do it. Clothing wise,

2396
02:28:01,090 --> 02:28:04,600
chocolate store.com that's how I see it.
That's all I see it as a whole.

2397
02:28:04,930 --> 02:28:09,930
That's what it is and
subtle representation of
the path can also be done.

2398
02:28:11,290 --> 02:28:12,123
Yes.

2399
02:28:13,330 --> 02:28:16,390
On that store you can check it out
for yourself and see some subtle

2400
02:28:16,391 --> 02:28:20,440
representation of a, yeah,
deep. How should I say?

2401
02:28:20,460 --> 02:28:23,330
D representation.
You know

2402
02:28:24,890 --> 02:28:29,120
chuck? Yeah. Chocolate Store
Corp Com and Jocko white tea.

2403
02:28:29,750 --> 02:28:30,800
What up with it?

2404
02:28:31,730 --> 02:28:35,150
Tastes delicious is
completely good for you.

2405
02:28:35,870 --> 02:28:39,590
Isn't it weird that people
would make foods that are
not completely good for you?

2406
02:28:39,710 --> 02:28:43,850
But yet most people make foods that
are not completely good for you. Yes.

2407
02:28:43,851 --> 02:28:48,320
Jocko white tea is completely good. Real
well, it goes beyond accidents. Yeah.

2408
02:28:48,590 --> 02:28:50,930
Tastes delicious.
Got a little caffeine.

2409
02:28:50,950 --> 02:28:53,960
A little hitter is not going
to get you crazy. Is Not a,

2410
02:28:54,110 --> 02:28:57,920
it's not an energy drink
that makes you psychopath,

2411
02:28:58,100 --> 02:29:02,270
makes you addicted to
caffeine. No, it's not that.

2412
02:29:02,390 --> 02:29:06,560
It gives you a nice little hitter, a
little caffeine hit her Theo. Yeah.

2413
02:29:07,130 --> 02:29:11,450
Well, yeah. I mean, I wouldn't even
say this. The caffeine is significant.

2414
02:29:11,480 --> 02:29:14,090
It's not nothing. No, it's 60
milligrams. That's, that's,

2415
02:29:14,240 --> 02:29:18,310
that's lower than a cup of coffee.
Two thirds of a cup of coffee. Yeah.

2416
02:29:18,780 --> 02:29:21,590
That's solid. Good. Yeah. You feel it,

2417
02:29:23,210 --> 02:29:27,140
but it's actually good for you. And that's
the thing, going back to, uh, you know,

2418
02:29:27,141 --> 02:29:31,070
the short term, long term or
long game. Short game. Yeah.

2419
02:29:31,100 --> 02:29:34,430
That's the reason people
sell food, drinks, whatever,

2420
02:29:34,431 --> 02:29:38,420
that are not good for you because they're
selling to the short game players.

2421
02:29:38,660 --> 02:29:43,220
Yeah, he's good with all
the the sugars and whatnot.

2422
02:29:43,420 --> 02:29:47,560
Don't get on that path. No, no,

2423
02:29:47,660 --> 02:29:50,150
we're not playing that game anymore.
Jocko white tea.

2424
02:29:50,180 --> 02:29:54,190
You can get it with tea bags or
you can get it with an a can. Yes,

2425
02:29:54,520 --> 02:29:57,230
and I have lots of cans and I just
crack them open and get after it.

2426
02:29:57,650 --> 02:30:01,520
And you see everyone already knows that
you get an 8,000 pound dead lift with

2427
02:30:01,521 --> 02:30:03,860
that.

2432
02:30:16,911 --> 02:30:18,530
You don't know about
the warrior kid podcast.

2433
02:30:18,730 --> 02:30:23,570
The warrior could podcast
is awesome I think.

I think so too.
So check out the warrior kid podcast.

a warrior kit up there, making
soap, building a business,

2437
02:30:34,461 --> 02:30:37,200
creating a brand.
Yup.

2438
02:30:37,670 --> 02:30:41,030
But most of all milking goats and
turn it into something usable.

2439
02:30:41,180 --> 02:30:44,250
That's what I like. Working
hard. They get right? Yeah.

2440
02:30:44,330 --> 02:30:47,210
That's what I'm talking about.
Don't forget about youtube.

2441
02:30:48,050 --> 02:30:53,000
We have a youtube channel.
It's called Jocko podcast.

2442
02:30:53,030 --> 02:30:57,650
Yes, yes. Called Jocko podcast. This
is where echo puts all these videos.

2443
02:30:57,950 --> 02:30:58,880
He puts them on there,

2444
02:30:59,120 --> 02:31:04,120
including these full podcasts and
including excerpts and including enhanced

2445
02:31:05,840 --> 02:31:10,430
excerpts that he goes oh crazy with his
old digital CGI stuff and to make things

2446
02:31:10,431 --> 02:31:14,330
explode. Sure. Sometimes
also psychological warfare.

2447
02:31:14,560 --> 02:31:16,640
He didn't know what that is. I
know. We all know what that is.

2448
02:31:16,641 --> 02:31:18,290
We're waiting for a
psychological warfare too,

2449
02:31:18,291 --> 02:31:21,750
but in the unlikely event that you
don't know what it is, this is what is,

2450
02:31:22,020 --> 02:31:26,400
it's an album with tracks.
Jocko tracks Jocko talking to you,

2451
02:31:26,401 --> 02:31:30,940
telling you, telling us really
how to get past these moments,

2452
02:31:30,941 --> 02:31:35,340
a weakness. Cool. In our
journey on the pole, lifting,

2453
02:31:35,550 --> 02:31:40,140
waking or whatever we got to do.
I gave you let you talk about that.

2454
02:31:40,141 --> 02:31:43,420
Why now and you know what? You don't
want to rely. I figured this out.

2455
02:31:43,800 --> 02:31:46,890
This is why you're like, yeah. He's like,
yeah, that's what it is. Boom. Move on.

2456
02:31:46,891 --> 02:31:51,450
Kind of kind of attitude. You know
why? Why? Because you don't use that.

2457
02:31:51,570 --> 02:31:52,291
You're not going to put,

2458
02:31:52,291 --> 02:31:55,220
you're not going to play the MP
three of yourself telling yourself,

2459
02:31:55,370 --> 02:31:57,480
well I don't know, maybe do,
but I don't think you do.

2460
02:31:57,690 --> 02:32:00,870
You already had that MP3 embedded
in your brain or anything. In fact,

2461
02:32:00,871 --> 02:32:05,170
that's what it is. It's literally what
it is. But I do, so I know that. Yeah.

2462
02:32:05,250 --> 02:32:06,180
You know more than me.

2463
02:32:06,210 --> 02:32:08,940
Cause it's weird because sometimes
I do and it's sort of like,

2464
02:32:10,080 --> 02:32:13,530
it's Sorta like the,
the discipline goes freedom field manual.

2465
02:32:14,040 --> 02:32:17,440
I did write that book, but sometimes
I have to refer to it. Yeah.

2466
02:32:17,790 --> 02:32:21,120
Sometimes I have to refer to it
and I'll tell you what, it's good.

2467
02:32:21,370 --> 02:32:26,370
It's good to be able to refer to something
that actually states in no uncertain

2468
02:32:27,931 --> 02:32:32,880
terms, the direction of the
path and where you need to walk.

2469
02:32:32,950 --> 02:32:36,350
We need to move. It's very, it is very,

2470
02:32:37,140 --> 02:32:42,140
there's a lot of clarity in it and
that's powerful to be able to refer to

2471
02:32:43,171 --> 02:32:47,500
something back like that, you
know? Yeah. So fully. Yeah.

2472
02:32:47,690 --> 02:32:51,630
So psychological warfare, same
thing. When I listened to it,

2473
02:32:52,440 --> 02:32:55,260
it definitely has an impact.
There's no doubt about it.

2474
02:32:55,650 --> 02:32:57,720
When you get psychological
warfare and you click it,

2475
02:32:59,230 --> 02:33:01,980
it's going to get through to you.
It almost like,

2476
02:33:02,040 --> 02:33:04,770
and I'm trying to imagine this
right now, like let's say, okay,

2477
02:33:04,771 --> 02:33:08,550
you know how the night before you might
have this problem might not on and off,

2478
02:33:08,580 --> 02:33:10,410
but the end of the night
before you're like, Hey,

2479
02:33:10,411 --> 02:33:12,570
I know you probably don't actually,
hey,

2480
02:33:12,600 --> 02:33:14,220
this is what I'm going to do
tomorrow I'm going to take care of,

2481
02:33:14,400 --> 02:33:15,150
take care of business.

2482
02:33:15,150 --> 02:33:17,550
I'm gonna work out this at this time
and I'm doing something to do this.

2483
02:33:17,551 --> 02:33:18,810
And then tomorrow comes and you're like,
Dang,

2484
02:33:18,811 --> 02:33:22,590
I'm kind of not in the mood for that. So
I'm just going to, I won't do that today.

2485
02:33:22,591 --> 02:33:23,640
I'll,
I'll skip that.

2486
02:33:24,030 --> 02:33:27,270
I'll opt out of that today cause
I'm not in the mood or whatever.

2487
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:30,360
But what if you,

2488
02:33:30,750 --> 02:33:35,700
if you have like an audio file
of yourself telling you, hey,

2489
02:33:35,790 --> 02:33:39,150
this is why you should do this.
Yeah, it would bring you back.

2490
02:33:39,151 --> 02:33:43,530
I think even if it's yourself
know, huh? Interesting.

2491
02:33:43,980 --> 02:33:47,100
Interesting little phenomena.
Never explored that. Nonetheless.

2492
02:33:47,140 --> 02:33:50,250
Good psychologic warfare.
It's called psychological warfare.

2493
02:33:50,610 --> 02:33:55,200
It's on Amazon. Itunes. Where we
can get the artist is Jocko Willink.

2494
02:33:56,530 --> 02:34:01,530

02:34:08,040 --> 02:34:12,970
don't hesitate in making
psychological warfare to her ass.

2497
02:34:12,990 --> 02:34:15,690
I can play it to myself. Deal. Anyway,

2498
02:34:15,691 --> 02:34:19,750
also near path on the path
we're working out. Boom.

02:34:54,301 --> 02:34:58,620
can get that. You can get where
the warrior kid and Mark's mission.

2508
02:34:58,740 --> 02:35:01,230
Two books teaching kids
how to be on the path.

2509
02:35:02,460 --> 02:35:04,440
You've got discipline equals freedom.
Which I just talked about

2510
02:35:07,080 --> 02:35:10,020
teaching adults how to go on
the path and stay on the path.

2511
02:35:10,590 --> 02:35:13,530
The audio that is on iTunes.
I'm Amazon music, Google play,

2512
02:35:14,940 --> 02:35:15,990
extreme ownership.

2513
02:35:17,250 --> 02:35:20,160
The first book that I wrote
with my brother Leif Babin,

2514
02:35:20,820 --> 02:35:25,470
it's about leadership and that is followed
up by the dichotomy of leadership,

2515
02:35:25,770 --> 02:35:30,770
which actually goes granular on
the nuances of extreme ownership.

2516
02:35:31,680 --> 02:35:36,680
So check that one out and we'll real
quick back to Mikey and the dragons.

2517
02:35:37,620 --> 02:35:40,440
This what's good about this book
and I was talking about life,

2518
02:35:40,950 --> 02:35:42,270
talking with life about it this morning,

2519
02:35:42,470 --> 02:35:47,470
eight applies it to everything for a
kid because kids have to think about it

2520
02:35:48,421 --> 02:35:52,230
when you're a kid, what are you
when you're a kid facing the world,

2521
02:35:52,680 --> 02:35:57,250
everything is hard.
Everything is scary. Yeah.

2522
02:35:57,420 --> 02:36:00,450
And so you have all these fears to
overcome and miking the dragons,

2523
02:36:00,630 --> 02:36:04,410
lace leaf throws that at his son says,
Hey,

2524
02:36:04,970 --> 02:36:09,150
got to face these dragons and fire it
up. You know? And that's what you do.

2525
02:36:09,170 --> 02:36:11,400
You learn these lessons
and it's a life lesson.

2526
02:36:11,820 --> 02:36:16,560
So Mike and the dragons get some
of that. What else? Echelon Front.

2527
02:36:16,890 --> 02:36:17,760
Speaking of life.

2528
02:36:17,820 --> 02:36:21,360
This is our leadership consultancy and
what we do is solve problems through

2529
02:36:21,361 --> 02:36:25,550
leadership. Me, Lafe, Bab and JP to Dave
Burke, Flynn Cochran, Mike [inaudible],

2530
02:36:26,250 --> 02:36:27,083
Mike [inaudible].

2531
02:36:27,930 --> 02:36:32,310
If you're having problems with your team,
with your company,

2532
02:36:32,311 --> 02:36:34,350
with your organization,
with your business,

2533
02:36:35,190 --> 02:36:37,830
and you want to turn
those problems around,

2534
02:36:38,610 --> 02:36:41,220
the problems are leadership problems.
That's what they are.

2535
02:36:42,150 --> 02:36:44,220
Every problem you have
is a leadership problem.

2536
02:36:44,850 --> 02:36:48,750
Go to echelon front.com if you want us to
come and help you solve those problems,

2537
02:36:48,760 --> 02:36:52,470
we solve problems to leadership.
The muster. Speaking of leadership,

2538
02:36:52,530 --> 02:36:57,530
there's a leadership conference event
that we have 2019 May 23rd and 24th

2539
02:36:59,880 --> 02:37:02,850
Chicago,
September 19th and 20th Denver,

2540
02:37:03,210 --> 02:37:06,630
December 4th and fifth Sydney,
Australia.

2541
02:37:07,920 --> 02:37:11,400
Go to extreme ownership.com if you
want to come to one of those events,

2542
02:37:11,460 --> 02:37:15,000
they have all sold out and
these are gonna sell it.

2543
02:37:15,410 --> 02:37:18,200
The last one we did in San Francisco,
they've all sold out,

2544
02:37:18,201 --> 02:37:22,010
but the one we just did in San Francisco,
I had people calling me 10 days out,

2545
02:37:22,011 --> 02:37:23,270
personal friends that were like,
hey,

2546
02:37:23,271 --> 02:37:25,640
just want to bring three people from my
team. And I'm like, oh, that's cool. No,

2547
02:37:25,970 --> 02:37:30,770
you can't come. We have a fire code. We
cannot bring you into the building. Stop.

2548
02:37:30,980 --> 02:37:35,210
Don't, don't come. Because you know, you
know some people just figure you're like,

2549
02:37:35,240 --> 02:37:38,660
oh, you can just squeeze me in
there. I actually can't do that.

2550
02:37:39,890 --> 02:37:42,950
They're all, they all have sold
out. They are all going to sell out.

2551
02:37:42,951 --> 02:37:45,770
So go there and register
as quick as you can.

2552
02:37:46,170 --> 02:37:49,880
Eff Online is live is launched.

2553
02:37:50,540 --> 02:37:51,800
What is that?
I'll tell you what,

2554
02:37:51,801 --> 02:37:56,420
if you can't make it to a muster or you
can't afford to go to the muster or you

2555
02:37:56,421 --> 02:38:01,421
can't afford to bring 12 people from
your team to the muster f online,

2556
02:38:01,670 --> 02:38:03,290
that's what e f online is.

2557
02:38:03,300 --> 02:38:08,300
We the original intent of f online was
to be able to train people without having

2558
02:38:10,191 --> 02:38:13,220
them have to come to the muster.
Give them the same experience,

2559
02:38:13,290 --> 02:38:17,750
give them the same knowledge about having
to come to the muster. So we did it.

2560
02:38:18,440 --> 02:38:23,420
And Eff, online.com
interactive. You get the briefs,

2561
02:38:23,450 --> 02:38:27,980
you get to go through
scenarios. It's, it's powerful.

2562
02:38:27,981 --> 02:38:30,050
It's way more powerful than
I thought it was going to be.

2563
02:38:30,051 --> 02:38:31,070
And I thought it was going to be good,

2564
02:38:31,071 --> 02:38:32,880
but it's better than I thought
it was going to be. Yeah, it's,

2565
02:38:32,990 --> 02:38:36,490
it's interesting too, because I went
through, I went through it, you know,

2566
02:38:36,610 --> 02:38:38,720
it was like, oh yeah, you
know, like cool. This is like,

2567
02:38:38,721 --> 02:38:42,560
just like when we talk about at the muster
or what you guys, what I listened to.

2568
02:38:43,010 --> 02:38:46,940
And then it's cool because at sort of at
the end of, of the sections or whatever,

2569
02:38:46,941 --> 02:38:47,990
there's like a little quiz.

2570
02:38:48,020 --> 02:38:52,310
I think the way the thing came out and
we're continuing to work on it and work,

2571
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:56,550
continue to upload new modules. So
like, oh, and what's, and the other.

2572
02:38:56,800 --> 02:38:58,940
So one of the reasons
that we made it was to,

2573
02:38:59,570 --> 02:39:03,380
was to help people that weren't coming,
that couldn't have come to the roster,

2574
02:39:03,381 --> 02:39:05,390
whether they were overseas and
they couldn't afford it. I didn't,

2575
02:39:05,391 --> 02:39:06,224
couldn't get time off.

2576
02:39:06,710 --> 02:39:11,710
The other major demand signal was we work
with giant companies that have 100,000

2577
02:39:11,931 --> 02:39:16,931
employees and one particular company with
over a hundred thousand employees said

2578
02:39:18,441 --> 02:39:21,290
to me, Hey, well we want you to
train every employee we have.

2579
02:39:21,560 --> 02:39:25,670
And this was two years ago and I didn't
have a good answer for him and I don't

2580
02:39:25,671 --> 02:39:28,430
like having to not having a
good answer. Right? Yeah. Oh,

2581
02:39:28,431 --> 02:39:32,450
you want me to travel globally for the
next six months to all your different

2582
02:39:32,451 --> 02:39:33,650
factories?
And it wasn't six months.

2583
02:39:33,651 --> 02:39:36,680
It was probably gonna take three and
a half months or something like that.

2584
02:39:36,860 --> 02:39:40,820
That's not feasible. Like I can't
just go off the grid everywhere else.

2585
02:39:40,821 --> 02:39:43,790
Not Recording podcasts, be traveling
the world, training people. Right.

2586
02:39:43,791 --> 02:39:48,430
That's not going to happen. So what are
we going to do? You have online? Yeah.

2587
02:39:48,500 --> 02:39:51,200
And so we've got an enterprise with it
to where you can have your whole company

2588
02:39:51,201 --> 02:39:55,340
training and it's awesome. It's awesome.
So good. Get your people in line.

2589
02:39:55,341 --> 02:39:58,580
That's the half online and of course
one last thing. Do you have Overwatch?

2590
02:39:58,640 --> 02:40:03,640
This is us connecting proven lead combat
leaders from special operations and

2591
02:40:04,941 --> 02:40:09,941
from combat aviation and we're bringing
them into companies that need leadership

2592
02:40:12,140 --> 02:40:15,120
in their organization
to get problems solved.

2593
02:40:15,480 --> 02:40:19,740
Go to e f overwatch.com you want
people that know and understand extreme

2594
02:40:19,741 --> 02:40:22,080
ownership,
no one understand the laws of combat.

2595
02:40:22,081 --> 02:40:24,570
No one understand how to balance
that economy of leadership.

2596
02:40:25,260 --> 02:40:29,160
Go to e f overwatch.com whether you're
a person that's trying to hire or a

2597
02:40:29,161 --> 02:40:31,440
person that's trying to get hired,
if you're one of those vets,

2598
02:40:31,880 --> 02:40:36,630
go and sign up there and if you have
anything to communicate with us,

02:40:45,040 --> 02:40:50,040
and on that fee she bookie echo is at
echocharles in I am at Jocko Willink.

2602
02:40:55,570 --> 02:40:56,410
And finally,

2603
02:40:56,411 --> 02:41:01,060
thanks to all of our military personnel
out there for training hard and for

2604
02:41:01,061 --> 02:41:05,950
holding the line as always
against evil around the globe.

2605
02:41:05,951 --> 02:41:10,170
And also thanks to our uniform
personnel here on the home front.

2606
02:41:11,300 --> 02:41:13,640
And that includes police
and law enforcement,

2607
02:41:13,641 --> 02:41:17,060
firefighters and paramedics in the mts
and correctional officers and border

2608
02:41:17,061 --> 02:41:20,680
patrol in all first responders.
Thank you.

2609
02:41:20,690 --> 02:41:23,840
And to everyone else out there,

2610
02:41:26,670 --> 02:41:30,330
like Machiavelli says in his book,

2611
02:41:31,290 --> 02:41:34,270
not the one that you've heard about,
but what he actually says,

2612
02:41:34,271 --> 02:41:37,540
guard yourself from flattery
by demanding the truth,

2613
02:41:37,541 --> 02:41:41,530
especially with truth from yourself and
choose good people to be around you.

2614
02:41:41,531 --> 02:41:46,531
And set a good example by acting with
courage and gravity and fortitude

2615
02:41:50,620 --> 02:41:52,960
and study the art of war.

2616
02:41:54,050 --> 02:41:54,620
Yeah,

2617
02:41:54,620 --> 02:41:59,620
it's rules and it's discipline and keep
your body accustomed to the hardships.

2618
02:42:02,540 --> 02:42:03,120
Yeah.

2619
02:42:03,120 --> 02:42:06,480
And exercise your intellect with reading.

2620
02:42:06,630 --> 02:42:08,760
And last but not least,

2621
02:42:11,760 --> 02:42:13,830
even when the weather is fair.

2622
02:42:15,090 --> 02:42:15,680
Yeah.

2623
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:18,620
In fact,
especially when the weather is fair,

2624
02:42:18,950 --> 02:42:20,930
make provisions.

2625
02:42:21,910 --> 02:42:22,480
Okay.

2626
02:42:22,480 --> 02:42:27,480
Build defenses and barriers and dams
and canals and protection protections

2627
02:42:30,370 --> 02:42:34,420
against the rising waters of misfortune.

2628
02:42:34,570 --> 02:42:36,910
So even when things go wrong,

2629
02:42:39,440 --> 02:42:41,960
you are ready to get out there

2630
02:42:44,460 --> 02:42:48,630
and get after it.
And until next time,

2631
02:42:49,200 --> 02:42:52,770
this is echo and Jocko out.
