1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:06,230
This is Jocko podcast number
94 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,180
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:17,260
The black cloud of smoke exploded silently
outside the open door of the Dakota

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:22,540
obscuring for the moment my view of the
geometrical Dutch landscape deserted,

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,490
but for a few for Lauren cows.
As soon as the sea,

6
00:00:28,491 --> 00:00:29,480
it appeared below us.

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,860
I started to think about the flack and I
knew that everyone else in the aircraft

8
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:35,270
must be worrying as well.

9
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:36,590
Okay.

10
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,170
When we crossed the
east Anglican coastline,

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,130
that slight wave of movement
had flickered down the aircraft.

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,140
As the men check their watches,

13
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,340
calculating the time it would take to
fly over the sea and come within range of

14
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:52,220
the now alerted German antiaircraft guns

15
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,573
below us.

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,470
The air sea rescue launches of the RAF
dotting the water at precise intervals

17
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:04,630
were pleasantly comforting.
The narrow band of beach,

18
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,050
which was the coast of Holland,
had aroused us once again.

19
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,020
As the flooded fields flashed into view,

20
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,430
private Harrison had leaned across to
point out the guns and the ground shooting

21
00:01:15,431 --> 00:01:17,830
up at the massed ranks of our aircraft.

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,440
At the sound of my Batman's voice,
which had been silent for the past hour.

23
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:28,710
The men near to the open
doorway had craned forward
to see what they could while

24
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:33,380
the rest anxious for the first indications
of the enemy had twisted their next

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,740
appear through the small
windows at their backs.

26
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,140
At first I could see nothing

27
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:46,060
and I was stupidly aggravated
that everyone but myself
could spot gun flashes.

28
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,220
Then came that cloud of smoke
producing an odd sense of satisfaction,

29
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,730
a reaction which immediately shamed me.

30
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,800
This was the behavior of
a small boy for all that.

31
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,860
It was satisfying not
to feel scared by it.

32
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,910
Perhaps it was because the
experience was not only novel,

33
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,400
but in some way impersonal.

34
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,160
Looking down the dark tunnel of the
aircraft at the double line of soldiers.

35
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,060
It was a relief to see that all
traces of nervousness at disappeared.

36
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,320
We had been waiting a long time for this.

37
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:34,390
So that is the opening of a
book called men at our Nim

38
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,620
and it was actually sent to me by a guy
by the name of James of federal and the

39
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:47,621
book was originally published under the
pseudonym Tom Angus and it was about

40
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,290
this battle at this place called
[inaudible], which is in Holland.

41
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,380
And in the book, the units that are doing
the fighting, they're not identified,

42
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:01,720
they don't say what units they are.

43
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:06,910
But shortly after the book was published
it became very clear and it was

44
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:11,911
revealed that the author was an
individual named Jeffrey Powell,

45
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,700
a British army officer and that the
unit that the book talks about was the

46
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,700
hundred and 56th parachute
battalion of the British army

47
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,170
who fought against all odds

48
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,780
and really with misfortune after
misfortune for eight days during Operation

49
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,320
Market Garden,
which is a famous world war two operation,

50
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:45,321
a bold and super aggressive plan and
also the largest airborne operation up

51
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,070
until that point.

52
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:55,070
And the goal was to isolate parts of
the German forces and to cut off what's

53
00:04:00,781 --> 00:04:05,340
known as the rare district, which is
like the heart of German industry.

54
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,520
And then open up a route going
from through that whole area,

55
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,480
take control of the roads and the bridges
and be able to punch right into the

56
00:04:15,481 --> 00:04:16,314
heart of Germany.

57
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,660
Over 40,000 airborne troops
took part in the operation,

58
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,200
including America's 82nd airborne
and the 104 first airborne divisions.

59
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,700
But the deepest, the, those that
jump deepest into enemy territory,

60
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,500
we're from the British British
first Airborne Division,

61
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,870
and that included this battalion,

62
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,990
the hundred and 56th parachute battalion.

63
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,010
And if you know anything
about Operation Market Garden,

64
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,610
although it did achieve
some beneficial things,

65
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,960
overall,

66
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,050
the mission was considered a failure
because it didn't actually achieve the

67
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:04,630
objectives that it wanted to achieve.
And as you can imagine,

68
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:09,690
those that were furthest out suffered
some absolutely catastrophic casualties

69
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,480
and people taken prisoner
and people killed in action.

70
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:17,603
Hm.

71
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,080
And, and this is only an eight day.
This is eight days long. So this,

72
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:25,550
this period that we're about to cover
is only eight days long and you're going

73
00:05:25,551 --> 00:05:26,520
to see that it is,

74
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,180
it is vicious and the names
were changed in this book,

75
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,200
but again,
this is an accountant,

76
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,330
an account from one of the company
commanders inside this battalion.

77
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,003
Okay.

78
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,560
So obviously the opening was them flying
over to the English Channel and getting

79
00:05:54,711 --> 00:05:58,880
ready to jump in to Holland. And
here we go. Back to the book,

80
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,830
I braced myself with the open door,

81
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:05,810
the first man in the stick to jump
gripping the fuselage and in case a sudden

82
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:09,440
jerk flung me out too soon,
leaning forward,

83
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:14,390
the wind whipped my face pouring over the
details of the plastic Dutch landscape

84
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:14,990
below.

85
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,610
I could now see one or two
cyclists dotting the otherwise
deserted countryside.

86
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,440
The flicker of the red warning light
near my face told me that there was one

87
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:25,274
minute to go.

88
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,530
Okay.

89
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:31,150
A railway line flashed blow the pattern
of the woods was familiar as the view of

90
00:06:31,151 --> 00:06:33,460
the stable yard from the office window.

91
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,660
The air photographs and the briefing
model of the ground had imprinted the

92
00:06:37,661 --> 00:06:42,130
shapes on my mind.
The pilots were dead on target.

93
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,420
More often than not. In the old
days we had been dropped a stray,

94
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,630
but these yanks always
learned from their mistakes.

95
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,220
I never saw the red light turn to green.
Harrison's hand slapped my shoulder.

96
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,420
I was out of the door.

97
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,850
The slip stream hit me flicking me
sideways and I fell away just catching a

98
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:05,600
glimpse of Harrison in the air above me
and the tail of the aircraft flashing

99
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:08,300
out of sight.
Then I was floating,

100
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,040
suspended gently in midair.
My parachute canopy, hi,

101
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,070
I looked up at the sky, choked with
hundreds of swaying parachutes.

102
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,010
Most of them pattern didn't
green and brown camouflage,

103
00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:27,240
but other others in a galaxy of
colors, red and orange, purple,

104
00:07:27,241 --> 00:07:30,900
blue and yellow,
vivid against the scattered white clouds.

105
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,460
Every moment more aircraft
arrived arrived to disgorge,

106
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:37,320
their car goes into the crowded air.

107
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,340
Then I noticed the humming we were
being shot at from the ground.

108
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,500
There were Boesch on the drop zone.

109
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,160
Something was badly wrong and opposed
landing with the enemy firing as we hung

110
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:53,550
from our parachutes,

111
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,820
parachutes or tried to collect our
weapons before we could gather into a

112
00:07:56,821 --> 00:08:00,720
cohesive force on the ground was something
new for us in the British airborne

113
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:01,554
forces.

114
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,410
Okay.

115
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,880
So as they're coming down,
they're getting shot at,

116
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,920
he uses this term throughout the
book, he calls the German Boesch, B,

117
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:11,840
O, c, h, e,

118
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,100
and where it comes from,

119
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,050
from what I gathered,

120
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:23,390
there's a French word that means
it could mean head like caboshing

121
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,860
or something like that.
And it also can mean cabbage.

122
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,000
And so I guess they're,
they're their slang term,

123
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:37,070
they're derogatory slang term was these
big headed German big cabbage heads and

124
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:41,540
he reduced that down to this term Boesch.
And it's a common one for them to use.

125
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:45,980
They used it a lot in world war one. And
so this is, this is a hangover from that,

126
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:47,300
but you're gonna hear
it throughout the book.

127
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:49,010
That's how he's referring to the Germans.

128
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,490
Back to the book of sharp pain burned.

129
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:56,340
The knuckles of my left hand blood
was seeping from my fingers. A bullet.

130
00:08:56,341 --> 00:08:58,560
Must've hit me,
grazed me anyway,

131
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,580
but now the heath land was rushing up,

132
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,780
raising my hands to lift the webs.
I pulled and then hit the,

133
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,950
and then the ground hit me with an
uncomfortable jar, a bad landing.

134
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,600
I lay in the sunken road listening
to the bullets cracking overhead,

135
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,440
and they're right there. They
get right into the mix. I mean,

136
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:23,760
it's immediately into the mix.

137
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:26,550
Obviously they're getting shot at and
the wig down and then as soon as they hit

138
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:29,670
the ground, it's on back to the
book of Man with bloodstream.

139
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,730
Bloodstains shell dressing
wrapped around his throat,

140
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:36,690
walked around the corner of the
walking towards us just as Pritchard,

141
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:38,250
who's a medic,
finished his work.

142
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,160
Then came a couple of
parties carrying stretchers,

143
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,320
the occupant of one unconscious,

144
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,410
the other with a cigarette
between his gray tight lips.

145
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,600
They were the first stream of wounded
men from a variety of units making their

146
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:53,910
painful way towards the dressing station,

147
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,200
which had been set up in the
woods behind us so far. See,

148
00:09:58,201 --> 00:10:03,060
company had been lucky only for men
were missing and a fifth that turned up

149
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:06,630
late, smiling cheerfully. Despite
a bullet through his bandaged arm.

150
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,070
Another four or five were limping and
hopping about on strained or twisted

151
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,010
ankles,
expressions of disgust in their faces,

152
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,740
victims of the gusty wind
on the droppings zone.

153
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,020
Okay.

154
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:22,200
All of them would have to be left behind.
But then I thought again,

155
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:23,790
calculating the figures once more,

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,710
perhaps we had not been so lucky after
all a 10th of the men who had in plane

157
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:33,140
that morning were already casualties.
It,

158
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,660
it sounded as if all the fighting had
happened on the far side of the droppings

159
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:39,130
zone in the Arnhem jerk direction.

160
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,950
Now the noise of the battle began to ebb.

161
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,010
The enemy posts had probably been overrun.

162
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:50,320
Neither news nor orders had arrived
from battalion headquarters,

163
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:55,150
but I knew better than to obstruct
the radio net with needless questions.

164
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,410
So first of all,
you're rolling into a situation where you,

165
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,190
you're on your insert and you
lose 10% of your men that that's,

166
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,040
that's just where you're starting
to. Now, if I remember correctly,

167
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:12,240
that is the standard kind of figure that
when you're conducting a big airborne

168
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:16,300
operation, like when the army
conducts big airborne operations,

169
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:19,720
that's what they figure they're going
to take for casualties on the drop zone.

170
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,770
Obviously they usually do better than
that, but for worst case scenarios,

171
00:11:23,771 --> 00:11:25,660
that's kind of what they figure
and that's where they're at.

172
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,140
The other thing that I thought
was cool is here he is,

173
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,180
he hasn't heard any word
from the battalion HQ yet,

174
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,160
but he's not going to jump on
the net and saying, hey boss,

175
00:11:33,161 --> 00:11:35,590
what do you want me to do? Hey, what's
going on? Hey, where do want me to be?

176
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:39,300
Because there's other people that are
trying to talk and he's got to just kind

177
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:41,800
of figure things out.
At this point,

178
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,990
now he's talking about his own company,

179
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,130
but here's the report on the net on the
rest of the battalion as he learned,

180
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,460
as he figured itself and as usual.

181
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,660
Obviously I'm not reading the whole book
and I'm skipping through big chunks of

182
00:11:58,661 --> 00:11:59,800
combat situations,

183
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,250
but at this point he figures out
what's going on with the battalion.

184
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:06,700
Going back to the book. Casualties
in the battalion had not been light.

185
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:12,010
Two officers and a hundred men
had failed to arrive among them.

186
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,590
The plane load,
which we had seen shot down

187
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,330
another load had probably been
dropped in the wrong place.

188
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,190
Ian Hampshire was one of the missing
officer's rumor had it that he was dead.

189
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,870
The other was the intelligence
officer whose job Jimmy Gray had.

190
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:33,850
Now combined with his own, Jimmy could
not explain the reason for the delay.

191
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,460
No one seemed to know,

192
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,960
and that's one of the parts that I
didn't go over it in the beginning of the

193
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:45,250
book. As they're flying in, as they're
seeing flack hit and explode around them,

194
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,060
you know,

195
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,620
they see another one of their aircraft
filled with their brothers go down,

196
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,240
no shoots.

197
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,353
Hmm.

198
00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:00,110
Now they start getting some coherent
input from the battalion and,

199
00:13:01,771 --> 00:13:03,870
and here's what they figured out.
Going back to the book,

200
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,810
we would move as had already
been planned in England,

201
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,030
the leading company of the battalion,

202
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,420
we've Leslie Doyle's platoon
number nine in the front,

203
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,200
some 200 yards ahead,
followed by company headquarters.

204
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,870
Then Luke Tyler's eight
platoon. Then Douglas Thompson,
seven platoon at the back.

205
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,740
As I had expected,
the company was ready to move.

206
00:13:25,741 --> 00:13:29,880
By the time orders had been given out,
two minutes.

207
00:13:29,881 --> 00:13:33,060
We're all that was needed for the men
to slide there and trenching tools into

208
00:13:33,061 --> 00:13:35,520
place, pick up their weapons
and sort themselves out.

209
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,220
No one had removed his equipment.

210
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,890
It was a lesson which the
colonel had drummed into us.

211
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,670
No Man must ever remove his equipment
when the enemy is anywhere near,

212
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,090
no matter whether he was digging,
sleeping, or deprecating,

213
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,390
whatever time it may be,
day or night,

214
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,320
a soldier had only to reach for his
weapon to be ready to fight or to march.

215
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,770
Just once this day,
just once each day,

216
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,670
one man in three at a time was allowed
to strips so that he could wash and shave

217
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,100
and shave.
They must.

218
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:06,870
Okay.

219
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:10,410
The last man of nine platoon
was disappearing around
the corner of the sandy

220
00:14:10,411 --> 00:14:14,330
track, which ran parallel with
the railway line to our Nim.

221
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:19,110
When I noticed the colonel standing on
the right next to the shell of a still

222
00:14:19,111 --> 00:14:22,500
smoking glider,
which partly blocked the battalion's path.

223
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:26,700
So there was paratroopers that came in,
but other people came in on gliders,

224
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,980
just big gliders, you know, no engine
that would get towed by other planes.

225
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,800
They're filled with men and they
were just land these gliders in,

226
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:36,660
in big open fields.
Hmm,

227
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,013
okay.

228
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:45,080
Gray was by the kernel side and behind
them crouched to not have radio operators

229
00:14:45,421 --> 00:14:48,300
and orderlies.
It was the same as ever.

230
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,250
The colonel's eyes were still,
but he never missed anything.

231
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:57,910
The unfastened pouch from which a grenade
or brand magazine could slip the slack

232
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,881
Chin Strap,

233
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:03,860
which would fail to hold a running man
steel helmet in place quietly there,

234
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:08,750
colonel would indicate the error to
whichever passing officer NCO was

235
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:12,890
responsible for the man.
Nothing was ever ignored.

236
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:18,650
Safely out of range. The offender would
mumble about the nitpicking old bastard.

237
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:23,330
But the abuse was usually
perfunctory and good natured,

238
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:29,150
all of the new his ways. And by now
they had learned that his fads mattered.

239
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,370
So the colonel's running a tight ship.
That's what he's doing.

240
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,770
He's a highly disciplined
guy and he keeps his,

241
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:41,950
keeps his troops in check and as you
can see they're not offended by that.

242
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,860
Like they, they, they complain about
it a little bit, but they also,

243
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,510
they also know it's the right thing to do.

244
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,820
Here we go back to the book, although
we were moving along our planned route,

245
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:58,010
our role in the battle had been changed
instead of making for the high ground

246
00:15:58,011 --> 00:15:58,970
north of our Nem,

247
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,590
the whole of the brigade was now marching
for the PR for the bridge to relieve

248
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:05,600
the struggling remnants
of the first brigade,

249
00:16:05,601 --> 00:16:08,390
which had been fighting alone
there for more than 24 hours.

250
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,130
One thing was certain, so, so they're,

251
00:16:12,131 --> 00:16:13,340
their mission had changed
a little bit there.

252
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,820
A Bridge and First Brigade was at
this bridge, had taken the bridge,

253
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:21,350
but now they're getting attacked at that
bridge by the Germans and there and now

254
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:26,650
these guys get this brigade gets the
orders to go and help them go and relieve

255
00:16:26,781 --> 00:16:30,530
them. Back to the book. One thing
was certain parachute infantry.

256
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,620
We're not the fast moving hard hitting
troops depicted by the daily press with

257
00:16:35,751 --> 00:16:40,751
no more transport in a battalion and then
for lightly armored carriers and some

258
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:41,660
half dozen jeeps.

259
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,740
Nearly everything needed in battle
either had to be carried on the backs of

260
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:48,050
soldiers or dragged behind them.

261
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,730
There were no trucks just behind the
forward companies loaded with spare

262
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:54,530
ammunition.
Instead,

263
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:59,710
extra bandoliers were strung around necks
and light anti tank mines swung from

264
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:00,950
waist belts.

265
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,060
Success came with surprise
in this sort of fighting,

266
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:09,920
the enemy must be caught unaware and
crushed before they could recover.

267
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,863
Inevitably,

268
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:17,000
we would run short of ammunition if
the Boesch we're allowed the chance of

269
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:18,050
standing and fighting.

270
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:24,310
This weary trudge toward the bridge and
our Nem along the endless tracks was a

271
00:17:24,351 --> 00:17:26,810
crazy way to use airborne troops.

272
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,000
Surprise had been lost long ago
before the operation started.

273
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,510
I doubted the wisdom of dropping
so far from the bridges.

274
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:41,140
Now it was clear that it had
been a mistake, so they're,

275
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,650
they're in a radically
different situation.

276
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,220
Instead of dropping in and holding
some ground, now they're moving.

277
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,490
They have to carry all their gear
with them. It's not a good situation.

278
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:57,300
He's talking about some of the guys are
carrying it as much as a hundred pounds,

279
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:02,700
which is a ton of weight
and now they get,

280
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,190
they get word from the
kernel back to the book.

281
00:18:05,191 --> 00:18:08,400
He was able to confirm that
the first parachute brigade,

282
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:11,580
we're still holding out the bridge where
the casualties had been heavy on both

283
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:12,414
sides.

284
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,860
The Germans having already lost 2000 men,

285
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:19,290
although it was not clear
who had counted them.

286
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:27,370
Now as he gets done with that,
he kind of gives some word,

287
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,010
they're going to start
moving down this track.

288
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:34,390
So he's giving that order to this.
One of his officers,

289
00:18:34,391 --> 00:18:37,780
Doyle and Doyle's normally,
you know,

290
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,940
pretty pretty fired up
about what he's doing.

291
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,340
He's a motivated guy and here we go.
Back to the book,

292
00:18:42,341 --> 00:18:45,490
Doyle was not at all
his in bullying itself.

293
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,800
The task of nine platoon was simple.

294
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:52,600
He and his men had to walk straight down
the track until they ran into the bush

295
00:18:52,601 --> 00:18:53,434
position.

296
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:58,570
Their first warning of the enemy presence
would be the rifle and machine gun

297
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:00,220
fire tearing into them.

298
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:06,190
Still less were the two scouts to be
envied who would be moving out in front of

299
00:19:06,191 --> 00:19:07,300
the rest of the platoon.

300
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:13,620
It was almost inevitable that the first
German rounds would hit one or both of

301
00:19:13,991 --> 00:19:14,530
them,

302
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,850
unless the Germans were cunning enough
to let them pass so as to kill more of

303
00:19:18,851 --> 00:19:19,770
the men behind,

304
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:26,210
but without armor in front to draw the
enemy fire and pinpoint their positions.

305
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,950
There was no other way to advance.

306
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:34,470
I had chosen Doyle to lead the advance
because I was certain that I could rely

307
00:19:34,471 --> 00:19:35,304
on him.

308
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,540
This was the penalty for
being good at one's job.

309
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,810
So there you go.

310
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:48,290
They're actually walking down train
tracks and they know 100% they know 100%

311
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,910
that Germans are waiting for them and
they're going to push down the tracks and

312
00:19:53,911 --> 00:19:56,670
the way they're going to find the Germans
is when the Germans start shooting at

313
00:19:56,671 --> 00:19:57,504
them.

314
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,140
Yeah.

315
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,070
So they proceed down the tracks
and now going back to the book,

316
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,160
the expected happen happened the column
of the night collapse in an explosion of

317
00:20:12,251 --> 00:20:17,251
light and noise from a wide arc in
front of nine platoon streams of white,

318
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:23,230
red and yellow tracer bullets converged
on the stretch of track where the men

319
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,420
must have flung themselves to the ground.

320
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,060
Very lights and parachute flares larger
and brighter than anything carried by us,

321
00:20:31,061 --> 00:20:32,680
swung down towards the earth,

322
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:37,000
lighting the dark country shy
to the shade of gray of a gray.

323
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:41,920
November morning, a house burst into
flames on the other side of the railway.

324
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:46,750
It was too sudden for an accident.
The conflagration must've been planned.

325
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,530
Anything which moved was now visible.

326
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,560
Overall was the noise,

327
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,290
the din of shells and mortars bursting
both behind and ahead merging with the

328
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:04,180
harsh roar of this enemy Spandau light
machine guns and the more sustained

329
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:09,100
drumming of the heavier weapons.
Now I could hear another sound.

330
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,280
It was a slow rat,
a tat tat of nine put tunes,

331
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:16,240
Bren guns and the crack of British
rifles replying to the German fire.

332
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:17,620
Okay.

333
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:22,450
There are a lot of enemy in front of us.
The Germans had men everywhere.

334
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:29,590
So this is like a well planned ambush
scenario and if you think about it,

335
00:21:29,591 --> 00:21:30,070
they had,

336
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:35,070
it sounds like they rigged this house
to light up and and be on fire and now

337
00:21:36,101 --> 00:21:41,020
that's backlighting and silhouetting
all the friendly troops because it just

338
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:43,060
makes you stand out because
it's a fire behind you

339
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,720
on top of that machine gun fire on top
of that mortar shells are hating you.

340
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,690
And here we go back to the book as as

341
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:57,450
okay

342
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,580
as the major here as
the company commander,

343
00:21:59,581 --> 00:22:04,440
Jeffry Powell is his crouched down waiting
as all this is happening out ahead of

344
00:22:04,441 --> 00:22:07,650
him. He's not with that first platoon.
He's behind them a little bit.

345
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,060
And here we go.
Back to the book,

346
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:12,840
I saw a single crouched figure running
up the track behind towards me.

347
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,890
Then I recognize the broad bulk of Barf,
Bartholomew,

348
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,090
Leslie Doyle's platoon sergeant.
This was quick.

349
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:26,010
Leslie had wasted no timing, sending
back news. Only a little out of breath.

350
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,480
Sergeant Bartholomew sank down
by my side and began to speak.

351
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:35,540
His voice is calm and sensible as usual
is leading section would come under fire

352
00:22:35,641 --> 00:22:39,240
at a range of only some 20 or 30 yards.

353
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:44,130
It appeared that the Germans had allowed
the two scouts to pass on molested,

354
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,710
but everyone else in the
front section had been killed.

355
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,210
Okay.

356
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:52,170
There were several other casualties in
the platoon as well, including Mr. Doyle,

357
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,770
who had been hit badly in the Fi,
and it was only semi-conscious.

358
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,770
The survivors were pinned
to the ground by fire,

359
00:22:58,771 --> 00:23:00,870
which was coming from
either side of the track.

360
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,350
This was all wrong with
his platoon commander,

361
00:23:07,351 --> 00:23:11,760
hit Sergeant Bart, follow them,
you, his place was with the platoon.

362
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,420
There were plenty of other people
to carry messages. Not only that,

363
00:23:15,421 --> 00:23:19,620
but Bartholomew could hardly have had
time to verify the disastrous information

364
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:22,470
about the leading section.
It was far too light,

365
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,620
far from likely that every
man in it had been killed.

366
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:32,500
So Bartholomew's nerve had
broken in the first test.

367
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So that's a situation this guy ran and
he comes back and reports in and says,

368
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:43,240
you know, hey, everyone's
dead. And he's, he realizes

369
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,650
he, the company commander
realizes that not true.

370
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,070
Going back to the book, perhaps the
responsibility had been too much for him.

371
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:53,510
Whatever it was.

372
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:58,630
He was certainly scared despite a success
in concealing the fact the sergeant

373
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:02,420
had run away leaving the
platoon to its own devices.

374
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:07,310
I was flabbergasted of all the end pose.

375
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:11,420
I had judged this cool reserved
man to be the most dependable,

376
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,770
a hard taskmaster,
too ruthless to be popular.

377
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:20,480
Sergeant Bartholomew had been an effective
foil to the easy going and friendly

378
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:23,720
Doyle and the two men
had formed a fine team.

379
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,350
It was incredible that
this should have happened

380
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,780
in the light of a flare.
I studied the sergeants face.

381
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,520
There was nothing to be seen.

382
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,350
Bartholomew returned my
glaze with steady eyes.

383
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:44,620
There could be no point in my further
destroying the man's self. Self respect.

384
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,980
It was possible that he might
recover after this first shock.

385
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,370
Has Pride taking charge
to control his fear?

386
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,403
Yeah,

387
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,400
so my rebuke was restrained no more than
a comment that Bartholomew illustrative

388
00:24:57,401 --> 00:25:00,460
sent private Jones back with
the news and not come himself.

389
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:05,720
Then I stood up once again told Robert
who had appeared by my side to take

390
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:08,900
charge and started down the
track toward the forward platoon,

391
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,180
motioning Bart following
meal to accompany me.

392
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:17,300
There was no need to say
anything to Harrison who
automatically rose to his feet.

393
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:20,630
His sten cradled in his
elbow ready to shoot.

394
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:24,290
So interesting leadership dynamic there.

395
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,910
Instead of saying you coward,
you quit, he doesn't do that.

396
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:33,770
Instead he, he really tones it back and
says he should have said Jones instead.

397
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:38,540
He's hoping that this guy will
recover and this is a great line.

398
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:41,840
His pride taking charge
to control his fear,

399
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,780
meaning this guy just has
no pride at this point.

400
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,550
He's trying to keep it together,

401
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,690
but hopefully the cap,
the,

402
00:25:50,691 --> 00:25:54,770
the company commander is
thinking that, okay, this guy,

403
00:25:54,771 --> 00:25:57,680
we'll get it back together hopefully
and we'll be able to utilize them as

404
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,470
opposed to me just dropping
the hammer on him right now.

405
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:04,310
In which case he might just
completely break and be worthless.

406
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,300
And the other thing, and I, I tried to
include as much as I could have this guy,

407
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:13,100
Harrison, that gets mentioned, who's
sort of the the the company commanders,

408
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:17,120
right hand guy, but he's just
always there, always ready,

409
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,490
always stepping up and
making things happen.

410
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,513
Hmm.

411
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,640
Now,
eventually as all that unfolds,

412
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,850
we're going back to the book Nesbitt,
which is one of the guys in that,

413
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,780
in that platoon,

414
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,290
Nesbitt had decided that it was time to
leave and had used the lol to bring back

415
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:41,350
the survivors of the platoon.
Two men were dead.

416
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,690
While nothing was known of the fate,
the two scouts with Nesbitt,

417
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,130
we're five wounded men,

418
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,760
two of whom including his officer were
being carried Leslie and shocking pain

419
00:26:53,461 --> 00:26:56,580
from a shattered fi,
which morphea had done little to help,

420
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,390
had fainted after a few yards
and was still unconscious.

421
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,470
A third of the platoon were casualties.
It was bad,

422
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:07,230
but not as quite as bad as
pictured by Bartholomew.

423
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,820
I could not blame Nesbitt for
withdrawing without permission.

424
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:16,680
Short of ammunition with their officer
wounded and the platoon sergeant

425
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,030
unaccountably missing.

426
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,930
The men had heard nothing of the troops
behind them for the past hour and had

427
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,180
concluded that the battalion
must've pulled back.

428
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:29,560
Nesbitt had seen a lot of war as this DCM.

429
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:34,150
One in Crete testified.
He understood it's muddle.

430
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:37,420
He knew it was rare for a
battle to go as planned.

431
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:43,980
His responsibility was to his men to
rescue them from what seemed to be a mess.

432
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,940
This he had done and his
judgment had been correct.

433
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,360
They were no place to
be caught at daylight,

434
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,130
overlooked on a forward slope and
unencumbered with wounded men.

435
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:01,260
So you see decentralized command in
action right there. Nesbitt doesn't here.

436
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,340
It doesn't know what's going on.
He makes a decision.

437
00:28:03,341 --> 00:28:06,820
I'm getting these guys out of here and
what's good is the company commander

438
00:28:06,821 --> 00:28:10,000
supports, Hey, do he made a good
call? That was the right thing to do.

439
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,193
Hmm.

440
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:18,250
Now at this point,
they're moving backed.

441
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,590
They're moving back after
they've confirmed, you know,

442
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,280
they'd pushed forward trying to find out
where the Germans were and now they're

443
00:28:24,281 --> 00:28:29,281
moving back because they realize that the
Germans are absolutely holding strong.

444
00:28:29,591 --> 00:28:30,670
So they'd had done this push forward.

445
00:28:30,671 --> 00:28:35,671
They've got basically ambushed
and now they'd pulled back after,

446
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:36,701
you know,
like I said,

447
00:28:36,701 --> 00:28:41,701
confirming where the Germans were back
to the book to accomplish this meaning to

448
00:28:42,491 --> 00:28:46,330
accomplish finding out where the Germans
were to accomplish this had cost us

449
00:28:46,331 --> 00:28:49,240
Leslie Doyle and the
absent bar following meal,

450
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:53,380
while two men and Doyle's leading
section were dead and the two scouts were

451
00:28:53,381 --> 00:28:55,750
missing,
probably either killed or made prisoner,

452
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,130
seven other men had been wounded,
including another sergeant.

453
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:05,730
This was a total of 13 casualties with
another nine men lost when we landed with

454
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:11,791
nothing at all accomplished over 20 men
had already been killed or injured and

455
00:29:11,921 --> 00:29:16,390
now the battalion was moving in the
wrong direction back the way we had come.

456
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,613
Okay,

457
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:23,190
and you're going to, you're going to find,
I mean, this is what makes this story so

458
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,450
d so devastating is that it?
You know,

459
00:29:28,451 --> 00:29:32,140
I talk about Murphy's law and things
go wrong. These guys are complete.

460
00:29:32,141 --> 00:29:34,600
It's just Murphy's law
over and over again and

461
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:36,390
okay.

462
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,550
In most of the books that we read on here,

463
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:41,710
there's triumph and there's
a victory at the end.

464
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:46,150
And you can see right now already where
this has headache and we got 20 guys

465
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,350
wounded or killed and instead of moving
forward, we're actually moving backward.

466
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,533
Hmm.

467
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,310
Back to the book. Sooner than expected,
we reached the battalion base.

468
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,530
It had been cited in a rectangular patch
of wood about 20 acres inside line just

469
00:30:02,531 --> 00:30:04,540
north of the railway.

470
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:06,560
Okay.

471
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:11,120
It was 2:30 AM a horrible hour especially.

472
00:30:11,121 --> 00:30:13,820
So if one is tired,
cold and hungry,

473
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,810
thank God it would be starting to
get light and a couple of hours.

474
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,410
What would happen tomorrow?

475
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,920
Something had gone very wrong indeed
by now we should be dug in on the high

476
00:30:27,511 --> 00:30:32,100
ground north of art, him waiting for the
Germans to counter attack the bridges.

477
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:37,020
Instead we were sitting here in the
woods only a few miles from where we had

478
00:30:37,021 --> 00:30:41,340
dropped with strong enemy forces between
ourselves and the city where the men of

479
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:44,130
First Brigade must be
fighting for their lives.

480
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,650
Wherever one turned. There seem to be
German troops and good ones at that.

481
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,700
The men who had stopped us,

482
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:56,020
had not behaved like rear area troops
scrape together to put up some sort of

483
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:59,290
resistance,
but it fought with skill and tenacity.

484
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:05,280
The slit trenches were dug and everyone
except for the double centuries in each

485
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:08,880
section and the officers and
NCOs on duty was sound asleep.

486
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,720
The men hump like dogs,

487
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,980
some curled up with a companion for
warmth lying in their full equipment,

488
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,800
their weapons tied to
their risks by the slings.

489
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:24,040
I should be asleep to
not sitting in worrying,

490
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,720
feeling sorry for myself,

491
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,870
for trying to get some rest and
preparation for the coming day.

492
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:34,400
Stand to would be at zero for 30 hours,

493
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:39,500
half an hour before first light when
everyone would be awake and ready and this

494
00:31:39,501 --> 00:31:42,950
slit weapon poised for
a possible dawn attack.

495
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:52,780
So they're dug in and of course
it's not looking good at this point.

496
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,620
They're going to stand to at zero
four 30 which is pretty common.

497
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:02,600
Going to be up before the sunrise and you
want to be up before the enemy as well.

498
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:03,703
Hmm.

499
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:08,990
Now they get together and get some word.
Here we go back to the book.

500
00:32:08,991 --> 00:32:12,920
It did not take long. He did not take
the colonel long to give us our orders.

501
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:16,430
The brigade was to renew its effort to
reach the bridge and bring relief to the

502
00:32:16,431 --> 00:32:19,910
men still fighting there, so
pretty simple, straightforward goal

503
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,123
and

504
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,220
in order to achieve this goal,

505
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:32,060
they set up to do an attack on this
little section of woods where they think

506
00:32:32,061 --> 00:32:34,190
there's a bunch of Germans in here.
We go back to the book.

507
00:32:34,191 --> 00:32:37,010
The leading sections plunged
into the wood and disappeared.

508
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,920
There were no there at all.

509
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,070
The information from
brigade must've been wrong.

510
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,950
We had attacked and
taken an empty position.

511
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:51,350
Never was there such an anticlimax,
but never was an anticlimax.

512
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,203
More welcome.

513
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:01,290
Now we get a little visit up
on the front lines. Here we go.

514
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:05,550
Back to the book. As the small spare
figure stepped out of the first vehicle,

515
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:09,150
I realized that it was the first time I
had seen the brigadier commander since

516
00:33:09,151 --> 00:33:12,390
we left England.
He was just the same as ever.

517
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,620
Relaxed and smiling.
Battle was nothing new to him.

518
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:21,890
He had been through the worst of the
desert war muddle in no way disconcerted

519
00:33:22,651 --> 00:33:26,430
him, at least not outwardly. It's
interesting. He uses the term,

520
00:33:26,431 --> 00:33:29,970
muddle it. He's talking about
the fog of war. This model,

521
00:33:29,971 --> 00:33:31,440
when you don't really
know what's happening,

522
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:34,830
and he talks about how the veterans are
used to it in a co and and accustomed to

523
00:33:34,831 --> 00:33:38,280
it and they can deal with it,
muddle in no way, disconcerted him,

524
00:33:38,281 --> 00:33:41,730
at least not outwardly.
He seemed to anticipate it.

525
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:45,960
Understanding how judgment and
behavior was impaired by danger.

526
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:47,970
Wherever he went,

527
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:53,210
he inspired confidence with his gentle
eyes and friendly manner for regular

528
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:57,870
cavalry officer. His background was
unusual. He had come to his regimen,

529
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:03,020
not from Sandhurst but from Oxford with
a double first and fluency and a half a

530
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:07,530
dozen languages,
and I love this line right here.

531
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:12,540
He wore his learning light neat
lightly as he did his decorations,

532
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,020
meaning this guy is highly
educated and highly decorated,

533
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:17,040
but you don't even know it.

534
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:22,140
It was rare for soldiers to be aware of
officers more senior than the colonels

535
00:34:22,141 --> 00:34:25,980
who commanded their battalions, but
every man in the brigade would recognize,

536
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,810
could recognize a name to brigadier.

537
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:33,000
The two visitors did not stay long,
but their appearance was a tonic for all.

538
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:38,180
It was a reminder that that there were
able men in charge even though the battle

539
00:34:39,331 --> 00:34:41,790
was developing in a rather odd manner.

540
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,113
Okay.

541
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,830
Now as they,
as he continues in these situation,

542
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,520
back to the book,
suddenly my preoccupation,

543
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,260
my preoccupation with the
problems of others ceased.

544
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:01,240
There was a familiar wine overhead and
I found my self propelled into the half

545
00:35:01,241 --> 00:35:04,690
dug a trench all but on top
of Galbraith and Robert,

546
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,210
the action had been reflex.

547
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,040
I knew that I had made no conscious
decision to jump as I lay there with my

548
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:16,630
second in commands and trenching tool,
carving into a ridge and my left buttock,

549
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,810
the mortar bomb burst about
eight feet to the right,

550
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,410
the scream of the shards
of jagged metal passing.

551
00:35:23,411 --> 00:35:28,390
Just overhead flailed my years as earth
and stones spattered down on top of us.

552
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,040
The stench of high explosive
filled my filled the trench.

553
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:37,800
My face I found was pressed into the
course material of corporal Galbraith's

554
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,130
battle trousers.
Gingerly raising my head,

555
00:35:41,131 --> 00:35:45,270
I peered over the low parapet at
the foot of the tree of a tree,

556
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:50,160
some 15 yards away, lay emotionless
heap, a green and khaki bundle,

557
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,600
which did not stir.

558
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,080
Okay.

559
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,590
Jumping out of the trench, I ran
across and turned over the limp body.

560
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:57,780
Okay.

561
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,620
The head fell back to show the open
staring eyes of Sergeant Hawks,

562
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,890
one of the seven platoon section
commanders, a bright young,

563
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:09,510
a NCO only just promoted who had been
with the battalion since the day it was

564
00:36:09,511 --> 00:36:10,344
raised.

565
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,120
Okay.

566
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:17,070
He was another old friend.
At first I could see no sign of injury,

567
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:21,180
but then I noticed the small hole in
the back of hawks helmet and the thin

568
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:23,580
stream of blood streaking
the back of his neck.

569
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:25,640
Okay.

570
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,110
Lying by hugging side,

571
00:36:27,111 --> 00:36:31,610
I seem to count seven explosions all just
a little further away than the first,

572
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,340
but still close enough
to smell the hot gases.

573
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:39,530
There was a short pause and then as if
it were not an afterthought and eighth

574
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:42,620
bomb struck the branches of the
tree just above us directing.

575
00:36:42,621 --> 00:36:45,290
It's hot metal splinters
down to the trenches below.

576
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:46,550
Okay.

577
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,900
A half strangled it's cry of distress.

578
00:36:48,901 --> 00:36:52,740
Brought my head up just in time to see
Corporal Pritchard clamber out of his

579
00:36:52,741 --> 00:36:55,080
slit and rate your race across the,

580
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:59,010
towards the CRI has half a sack of
medical supplies marked with its red cross

581
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:03,870
dangling from his hand. The pause
lasted no more than a half a minute.

582
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:06,390
Again, the wine again, I ducked.

583
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,960
This was the covering fire
for a counter attack or the,

584
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:14,130
was this the covering fire for a counter
attack or where the Boesch merely

585
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,750
harassing us?
Spitefully

586
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,180
okay.

587
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:20,750
But when I raised my head from Higgins,
from Huggins boots to look around,

588
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,810
I was relieved to see one of
the seven platoon Bren gunners,

589
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,220
his helmet and i's just above the level
of the parapet gazing down the track

590
00:37:28,221 --> 00:37:29,054
towards his front.

591
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,450
Okay.

592
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,430
So the centuries we're
still doing their job.

593
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,590
The fire was not forcing their heads down.
If there,

594
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,240
if this was the covering
fire for an attack,

595
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,940
we would not be caught unawares.

596
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:48,030
So that's the standard procedure right
here for the Germans and really for

597
00:37:48,031 --> 00:37:51,540
anyone it's covered move, right? We
put in big bonds, we put in mortars,

598
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:54,780
we put her on in artillery
and while you're hiding and
while you're ducking down

599
00:37:54,781 --> 00:37:58,950
so you don't get killed,
they maneuver it and then write it right.

600
00:37:58,951 --> 00:38:03,000
When they get so close that they're
in danger of their own artillery,

601
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:07,920
the artillery stops and then they proceed
with the assault. Here we go. The low.

602
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,130
Now there is a law of the law
provided a chance to finish digging.

603
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,460
There was no longer any need to
persuade the pen to dig faster.

604
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,440
The lesson had really been driven home.

605
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,370
We'd been dating for no more than a few
minutes when the sound of firing to the

606
00:38:20,371 --> 00:38:25,230
north slackened, but the noise from
the vehicles in front had increased.

607
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,980
The thought of guns only a few hundred
yards away was punctuated by the

608
00:38:28,981 --> 00:38:33,090
hammering of brands. By the way,
brands, I don't think I've said this,

609
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:37,980
brands are sort of the uh, weapon,
a British machine gun versus the,

610
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,790
the span now,
which is,

611
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:45,060
which is the German machine guns and
they use the Brits and the Americans use

612
00:38:45,371 --> 00:38:49,270
the term spanned out to talk
about basically heavy machine,

613
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,080
heavier machine guns.
But,

614
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:55,050
but that's what they're talking about
when you're talking about spend out.

615
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,210
And then a brand is the Brit machine gun.

616
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:04,370
Both Ford platoons were inaction and I
had placed company headquarters too far

617
00:39:04,981 --> 00:39:07,920
back to be able to see what was happening.

618
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,260
The walkie talkies were silent,

619
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:14,730
also quite worried about the sitting
of the full tune, some 300 yards apart,

620
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:20,030
each isolated in its own corner of the
woods and unable to support the others

621
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,810
against a determined attack.

622
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:27,360
This is so important for
tactical leaders out there.

623
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:31,500
Think about these lessons and these are
lessons that I talk about all the time.

624
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,140
And these are lessons that I used
to have to teach all the time.

625
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:37,380
So you've got your platoons,
they're out there doing something.

626
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,310
You need to be close enough that
you have communications with them.

627
00:39:41,311 --> 00:39:43,050
So that you actually
understands what's happening.

628
00:39:43,051 --> 00:39:44,400
And this is the same
in the business world.

629
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,590
If you put yourself in a
position to where you can't,

630
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:49,410
well you don't understand
what's happening in the field,

631
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,770
then you're not going to be able to help.
You're not gonna be able to support,

632
00:39:52,771 --> 00:39:55,770
you're not going to be able to,
to understand what's happening.

633
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:58,560
So you can make decisions.
Mm. So in this point,

634
00:39:58,561 --> 00:40:03,000
he's positioned himself too far away.
On top of that,

635
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,560
he's positioned his platoons
too far apart from each other.

636
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:12,480
So if you're too far apart from each
other, you can't cover for each other.

637
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:16,740
If you can't cover, you can't move.
And if you can't move, you can't win.

638
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,650
So those are critical points.

639
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,310
Make sure your command
position is close enough,

640
00:40:23,311 --> 00:40:26,360
not so close that you're
getting in the firefight. Note,

641
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,780
not so close that you're pinned down,

642
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,510
but close enough so that you
understand what is happening.

643
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:33,520
And then if you have multiple
elements in the field,

644
00:40:33,521 --> 00:40:37,170
do you get them close enough to each
other that they can support each other?

645
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,103
Always.

646
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,020
He sees a guy running back and here we go.
Back to the book,

647
00:40:46,021 --> 00:40:49,500
it was sergeant prior, one of Nesbitt
section commanders are rather sulky,

648
00:40:49,501 --> 00:40:52,560
man able and well educated,
but with a grudge against authority.

649
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:56,430
And his left lefthand prior
grasp is sten in a grip.

650
00:40:56,431 --> 00:41:00,000
So from that the knuckles showed
blue under the under the sunburn.

651
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:04,590
His right arm from which clothing had
been caught away at the shoulder was

652
00:41:04,591 --> 00:41:09,180
thrust into the front of his smock. The
elbow covered by a blood stain dressing.

653
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,440
His face was white with
shock and taught with pain.

654
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:19,230
A morphine injection was doing little to
alleviate the agony of an elbow smashed

655
00:41:19,231 --> 00:41:20,064
by a bullet.

656
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,170
Okay.

657
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:23,210
The news prior brought was serious.

658
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:28,900
The vehicles which we could here we're
Boesch armor driving backwards and

659
00:41:29,061 --> 00:41:33,950
forward along the road and sweeping the
front of nine paltunes position secure

660
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:38,890
from retaliation. So far, the
armor head only claimed prior,

661
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,270
but sergeant Avondale had been killed
by a mortar fragment as he dashed across

662
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,990
between a couple of trees to
put some question to Nesbitt.

663
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:53,550
This inexhaustible loss of skilled
leaders was serious in our parachute

664
00:41:53,801 --> 00:41:58,300
battalions on like usual infantry units,
section leaders ranked as sergeants,

665
00:41:58,301 --> 00:42:01,870
not corporals.
Nine platoon had now lost,

666
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:06,040
not only it's officer,
but three of its four sergeants as well.

667
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:11,230
Hawks was dead and one of seven platoon
section commanders had failed to appear

668
00:42:11,231 --> 00:42:16,231
at the rendezvous after the drop already
nearly half the sergeants had become

669
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:18,000
casualties.

670
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,300
This is just a nightmare unfolding.

671
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:29,583
Hm.

672
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:36,160
Back to the book. After we'd put the
final touches on our slit trenches,

673
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,270
time was found a scrape,
a shallow grave for sergeant hawks.

674
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:45,070
It was hard to suppress one's revulsion
at touching the body of someone I had

675
00:42:45,071 --> 00:42:48,580
known so well, but just as I
was stealing myself to do so.

676
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:50,200
Huggin step forward,

677
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:54,400
ripped open the dead man's smock and
shirt and slipped one of the two identity

678
00:42:54,401 --> 00:42:57,730
disks over the blood stained head,

679
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:02,950
the sergeant major then unbuckled his
watch and search the pockets for anything

680
00:43:02,951 --> 00:43:07,480
which might be useful.
A Morpheus syringe and a field dressing,

681
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:11,530
a bar of chocolate and a couple of mills
grenades, two packets of cigarettes,

682
00:43:11,531 --> 00:43:15,430
and a box of matches.
A couple of maps and a pocket knife.

683
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:20,800
There was nothing personal except for a
grubby on envelope containing a half a

684
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,800
dozen faded in dog geared snapshots of
the stout smiling girl holding a baby.

685
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:27,520
Okay.

686
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,130
Before buttoning the envelope
into his breast pocket,

687
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,400
hugging slipped the identity
disc between the photographs

688
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,890
I was helping Corporal Pritchard
shoveled the earth back over hawks body,

689
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,850
listening with one ear to hug and sharing
the dead man's ammunition and other

690
00:43:42,851 --> 00:43:45,310
possessions among the members
of the company headquarters.

691
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:49,300
When suddenly I became aware of
Jimmy Gray standing beside me,

692
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:53,500
apparently h just to speak,
but diff diffident at interrupting,

693
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:58,160
telling Pritchard to finish the job.
I rose from my knees.

694
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,590
Glad to be able to put my
mind to something else.

695
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:06,040
When I turned to speak to gray,
I was disturbed by what I saw.

696
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:11,670
The dirt of battle had
exaggerated his usual scruffiness.

697
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:12,700
Okay.

698
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,510
As smart controllers were coated with
mud and dust and his right sleeve was

699
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:20,320
stained from top to bottom with blood,
not his own.

700
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:23,140
As he explained when he
saw my eyes fixed on it,

701
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:28,930
the front of his smock and the battle
dress under neath had been torn by a large

702
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:30,460
fragment of a mortar bomb,

703
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:36,230
which in some miraculous fashion had
failed to even scratch him three inches to

704
00:44:36,331 --> 00:44:39,810
one side and it would have been set
and it would have severed his head,

705
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,680
but it was the eyes above
the pallet on shaven cheeks,

706
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:46,850
which were frightening.

707
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:48,290
Okay?

708
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:51,830
They were empty of life when he spoke.

709
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:56,690
The words are lucid and well chosen has
ever, but the voice lacked expression.

710
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:59,410
The phrases were cold.

711
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:03,910
It was not as if you were describing
events which he had himself witnessed,

712
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:07,360
but something unreal,
something half imagined.

713
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:14,030
B Company at attacked at
zero 800 hours at the start,

714
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:17,540
they're advanced through the woods had
gone like the first attack of the morning,

715
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:21,020
a calm and steady progress against
the seemingly nonexistent enemy.

716
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,360
Then some hundred yards
short of the objective,

717
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:29,140
a swath the fire had cut down the
men of the two leading platoons,

718
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:33,240
the half grown trees and the
sparse undergrowth had neater,

719
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:37,560
neither hidden them nor shielded them
from the interlocking arcs of the enemy

720
00:45:37,561 --> 00:45:40,470
weapons,
which covered every inch of ground.

721
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:46,240
It was just possible that they might
have been able to deal with the machine

722
00:45:46,241 --> 00:45:49,030
guns alone,
but the armor was too much for them.

723
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:53,350
Pumping shells into the men
at near point blank range

724
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,820
gray had seen it all happen.

725
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,240
Okay.

726
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,450
The colonel had tried to stop the attack
as soon as the full strength of the

727
00:46:01,451 --> 00:46:03,550
enemy position had become clear,

728
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:08,260
but by then more than half of the men
of the two leading platoons had been

729
00:46:08,261 --> 00:46:13,120
killed or wounded.
Both sub alternates were dead.

730
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:18,160
The other officers and the
CSM at all been wounded.

731
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:24,780
The colonel had tried to turn the German
flanked by sending a company around to

732
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:26,670
the left,
but there was no flank.

733
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:27,790
Okay.

734
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:32,440
The second attack had been a replica
of the first. It too had collapsed,

735
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:36,070
but not before some 40 more
men were dead or maimed,

736
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:39,460
including two of the
four surviving officers.

737
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,330
Okay.

738
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:46,330
Harry Bates had been terribly wounded
in the stomach and by now was probably

739
00:46:46,401 --> 00:46:47,234
dead.

740
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:52,890
That's great at pulled him behind
some cover his blood soaked to sleeve.

741
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:59,400
This was not the complete story.
There was further bad news.

742
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,810
Not only had our own
attack been shattered,

743
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:07,970
but the other battalion to our north
had hits similar enemy positions and was

744
00:47:07,971 --> 00:47:12,971
making little progress progress in its
efforts to get into our Nemo along the

745
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:17,360
main road
from somewhere or other.

746
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:21,560
The bullshit found enough troops of
quality good enough to smash the brigades,

747
00:47:21,561 --> 00:47:22,880
attempt to reach the city,

748
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:33,280
so we just have a horrible
situation unfolding.

749
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:35,743
Okay.

750
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:42,980
Back to the book from far away in the
distance came the drum of powerful

751
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:44,240
airplane engines.

752
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:49,700
Nesbitt was the first to spot the minute
shapes first circling and then diving

753
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:51,260
out of the sun towards us.

754
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:55,250
The noise changing to a shriek as the
machine swept down towards the wood,

755
00:47:55,700 --> 00:48:00,230
towards the woods from a half a
dozen different directions. Uh,

756
00:48:00,231 --> 00:48:05,231
happy shout of Spitfires rose from the
trenches at lasts some help but arrived

757
00:48:05,711 --> 00:48:06,950
from the outside world.

758
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:11,690
The RAF had arrived to give us
close air support and that's,

759
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:16,870
you know, we've had close air support
save the day many times in, in,

760
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,250
in books that we've talked
about on this podcast.

761
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:25,910
As I gaved up at the doesn't
spit screaming down to
strafe the Boesch positions

762
00:48:25,911 --> 00:48:27,200
on the sloping Ridge head.

763
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:32,300
Nesbitt's voice suddenly roared in my
year shouting to everyone to get their

764
00:48:32,301 --> 00:48:36,980
heads down and hide their
faces as I duct with the rest.

765
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:40,210
I spotted the black crosses on the wings.

766
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:44,420
The aircraft were not ours,
but German measure Schmitz.

767
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:50,630
Our air superiority was so overwhelming
that it never occurred to anyone that

768
00:48:50,631 --> 00:48:52,280
the machines might be hostile.

769
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:58,380
They were not diving onto the
enemy positions, but onto our own.

770
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:05,440
I gazed skywards the measure Schmidt
was so close that I could see the pilots

771
00:49:05,441 --> 00:49:06,274
face.

772
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:11,020
Two rockets detach themselves from the
wings and swooped down to explode seconds

773
00:49:11,021 --> 00:49:14,440
later in the woods where the
survivors of a and B companies,

774
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:18,790
we're settling into their new positions.
As I ducked once more,

775
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:22,810
there was another scream of engines from
behind followed by the sound of a storm

776
00:49:22,811 --> 00:49:27,670
of bullet striking branches on the trees
and the other side two aircraft which

777
00:49:27,671 --> 00:49:28,990
had discharge their rockets.

778
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:33,160
We're now carrying out a second run
strafing with their machine guns.

779
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:37,690
As I squeezed even closer to the earth
at the bottom of this shallow trench,

780
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:42,400
the reverberations of an explosion,
some 50 yards ways pounded my year drums.

781
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:44,080
It was another rocket.

782
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:50,890
Suddenly it ended the aircraft advantaged
as quickly as they had arrived.

783
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:57,540
Wow. Yeah. Cause at this point the, the,

784
00:49:57,541 --> 00:50:02,400
the British and the Americans had almost
total air domination and so everyone

785
00:50:02,401 --> 00:50:03,870
just completely assumed that,

786
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,840
oh thank God here comes some
spitfires to come and save us.

787
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,760
And and they were wrong.

788
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,380
Now the the air,

789
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:20,220
we did have air domination for the most
part and one of the things that they

790
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:24,130
needed as you,
as you heard these airborne troops,

791
00:50:24,131 --> 00:50:26,980
they can only carry so much and
so they're, they're going to need,

792
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:30,260
they need more ammunitions. They
need medical gear, they need food,

793
00:50:30,261 --> 00:50:32,720
they need water.
They need stuff to be dropped to them,

794
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:38,500
and so there was a plan in place for
them to have gear and food and equipment

795
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:45,500
and ammunition dropped to them at these
locations where they were supposed to

796
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:49,070
be, because remember they were supposed
to be making progress this whole time.

797
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:50,450
They're not making progress,

798
00:50:50,451 --> 00:50:54,080
but there are supposed to
be making progress and since
communication is so bad,

799
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:59,090
they can't call back and say,
hey, we're not. We're supposed
to be, we're over here.

800
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,280
Drop the gear on us.

801
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:05,810
But the gear gets dropped in
the pre planned positions,

802
00:51:05,811 --> 00:51:08,360
which of course our enemy positions,

803
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,050
but here's what it sounds like for them,

804
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:16,040
or here's what they're thinking on
the ground. Then to the south of us,

805
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:19,610
I saw the familiar shape of a line of
Dakotas approaching at about a thousand

806
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,680
feet in a minute.
The Sky was crammed with them.

807
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,750
It was the first supply drop about which
we had been told that the briefings,

808
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:31,820
but the drop zone was a couple miles
away over the other side of the hill.

809
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:33,980
Right in the middle of enemy positions.

810
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:35,210
Yeah.

811
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:38,060
By now, of course the division
should have captured the area,

812
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:39,980
but the Boesch still held it.

813
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:45,530
News of the progress of the battle could
not have reached the RAF or the pilots

814
00:51:45,531 --> 00:51:47,870
would have diverted a drop
their supplies elsewhere.

815
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:53,690
Now they can see this happening

816
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:59,390
and the people that are in the plains,

817
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:03,260
they're called the RASC,
the Royal Army Service Corps.

818
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:06,280
They run basically the
supply and the logistics and,

819
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:09,350
and help resupply and drop this equipment.

820
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:11,870
So this is,

821
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:17,150
he's as he's watching all these Dakota's
the Dakotas are these little transport

822
00:52:17,151 --> 00:52:17,421
plans.

823
00:52:17,421 --> 00:52:21,320
It's actually what they had parachuted
out of and now they're watching them drop

824
00:52:21,321 --> 00:52:25,430
this resupply
back to the book among the mass.

825
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,490
A Single Dakota just
overhead caught my attention.

826
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,030
Okay.

827
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:34,770
It had already been hit and flames were
creeping down from the starboard engine

828
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,000
toward the cockpit.

829
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:37,610
Yeah.

830
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:41,520
As it lost height, the khaki clad Ra. See,

831
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:46,250
dispatchers were standing at the
open doorway pushing out the penny,

832
00:52:46,251 --> 00:52:49,130
heirs of supplies.
Those are the bags of supplies.

833
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:50,640
Okay.

834
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:55,350
I could see their faces.
The fire was on their side of the plane.

835
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,020
The wing was burning before their eyes.

836
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,400
The Dakota was now little more
than 300 feet above the ground.

837
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:05,260
If the men at the door jumped.

838
00:53:05,261 --> 00:53:10,180
Now they might just save
themselves in a second or two more.

839
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:14,770
The aircraft would be so low that their
parachutes would not have time to open

840
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:18,820
this.
The men must have known,

841
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:23,000
but they went on with their routine drill,

842
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:27,000
pushing out the panty heirs regardless
of what would happen to them.

843
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,930
Then the starboard wing crumpled.

844
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:34,890
The flaming plane
disappeared behind the trees.

845
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:37,410
The panty are still
falling from the open door.

846
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,990
The Sky was empty.
The last plane had gone

847
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:45,940
cool,

848
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:49,120
but we still stood. Watching the
place where the Dakota had vanished.

849
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:54,340
Mourning the futility of the self
sacrifice we had just witnessed.

850
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:00,920
Right.

851
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,300
Can't even imagine that

852
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,530
guys just continuing to do their job

853
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:12,320
knowing their fate

854
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:16,403
at

855
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:21,950
there. Their senior officers at this
point, and they're in CEO's are,

856
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:26,951
are starting to get hit pretty regular
beach by snipers and so he decides to,

857
00:54:28,781 --> 00:54:30,580
he tells his his guys,
Hey,

858
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:35,740
take your take your rank off your uniform
because I don't want the enemy to know.

859
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:37,150
And he tells us to one of his,

860
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:41,490
one of his leaders name
named Robert and he says,

861
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,240
I watched Robert's slip,

862
00:54:43,241 --> 00:54:46,690
his captain stars off his shoulders
and tucked them away in his pocket.

863
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:52,320
I knew for certain that my second in
command disapproved officers should show

864
00:54:53,321 --> 00:54:57,970
themselves as such. So one
of his guys is thinking, no,

865
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:02,080
we're officers. We need to, we need
to stand out. We need to stand up.

866
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:05,383
Now

867
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,370
I mentioned the American forces,

868
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:12,610
the 82nd and the hundred and
first and the British forces.

869
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:17,700
There was also a Polish parachute brigade
that was coming in on this attack as

870
00:55:19,091 --> 00:55:24,091
well and they were scheduled to come in
a little bit later as reinforcements.

871
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,610
And here we go back to
the back whole book.

872
00:55:27,611 --> 00:55:31,060
Only then did I remember that the
glider born part of the Polish parachute

873
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:35,290
brigade was due to land that afternoon
upon the stretch of enemy upon the

874
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:36,970
stretch of open country below us.

875
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:41,170
At the same time as the parachute
battalions were dropped in the polder land

876
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,940
south of our Nem bridges,

877
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:48,190
the landing zone was already a battlefield
and the wretched polls we're about to

878
00:55:48,191 --> 00:55:52,360
land in the middle of it.
First the gliders hit the ground.

879
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:56,200
It's massive weight tearing up chunks
of stubble as it skidded to a halt

880
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,660
lurching onto one wing.
As it did so,

881
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:02,860
men jumped out and rushed to the rear
end to release the tail unit so that the

882
00:56:02,861 --> 00:56:07,480
vehicles inside could be driven out to
more gliders were not plowing across the

883
00:56:07,481 --> 00:56:07,990
ground.

884
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:11,950
Another exploded in the air and a vast
ball of yellow flame just as it was upon

885
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,120
the point of touching down,

886
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:17,530
mortar bombs were bursting among the
men struggling to release their loads.

887
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:22,650
While streams of chase tracer bisected
the scene into oddly formal patterns,

888
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:28,200
another glider was on fire on the
ground as still more swooped in to land,

889
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:33,490
adding to the chaos. The polls were
now joining in the battle themselves,

890
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:37,450
some firing toward the Germans,
some towards the Kpos B,

891
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:40,510
which is the king's own Scottish borders.
It's a,

892
00:56:40,511 --> 00:56:45,511
it's another British unit and some in
the direction of our other battalion.

893
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:51,100
It must be impossible for the Poles
to distinguish enemy from friend.

894
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:54,550
They probably thought they had
landed in a circle of Boesch units,

895
00:56:54,551 --> 00:56:58,290
all intent upon their destruction.
In a few minutes,

896
00:56:58,291 --> 00:57:01,020
it was all over from the
wrecked and flaming gliders,

897
00:57:01,021 --> 00:57:02,250
which now littered the ground.

898
00:57:02,251 --> 00:57:06,930
Small parties of Poles were making their
escape firing at anything they saw move.

899
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:11,130
Two or three vehicles had been
driven away, but otherwise
they'd failed the drag,

900
00:57:11,131 --> 00:57:13,050
their jeeps and guns from the gliders.

901
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:17,670
The Polish anti tank battery no
longer existed as a fighting unit.

902
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:22,380
It had landed in the middle of a battle
and been destroyed before it could fire

903
00:57:22,381 --> 00:57:26,880
a single shot waste. It
was waste. Once again.

904
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:30,600
Waste like the supply drop.
Nothing seemed to go right.

905
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,880
Uh, not have some eight
polls charged towards us.

906
00:57:34,881 --> 00:57:38,990
Intent on seeking shelter either in the
woods or behind the safety of a railway

907
00:57:38,991 --> 00:57:41,900
embankment,
some 30 yards away.

908
00:57:41,901 --> 00:57:45,260
One man slightly ahead of the others
must have noticed our camouflage steel

909
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:48,110
helmets in the slit trenches
ahead and shouted a warning

910
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:50,421
in a bunch.

911
00:57:50,421 --> 00:57:54,620
They flung themselves into the undergrowth
anticipating what would happen.

912
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:58,310
I yelled to everyone to get their heads
down just as a hail of bullets from the

913
00:57:58,311 --> 00:58:01,670
Poles whistled over our heads,
a few hitting the trench pair of pits,

914
00:58:01,671 --> 00:58:05,690
but most striking the trees well above
our heads as the excited men empty their

915
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:09,350
weapons in our direction.
So long as we kept our heads down,

916
00:58:09,351 --> 00:58:10,910
we were safe from the Polish fire.

917
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:14,900
But the worry was that some of them
might creep closer and start to fling

918
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,860
grenades around. However,
in a couple of minutes,

919
00:58:18,861 --> 00:58:23,750
the firing slackened and then ceased
possibly the polls sense that something

920
00:58:23,751 --> 00:58:25,970
might be wrong when no one retaliated.

921
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:30,650
The comparative silence provided the
opportunity to shout a warning across the

922
00:58:30,651 --> 00:58:33,020
narrow stretch of ground
which separated us.

923
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:37,580
There was no reply and I shouted
once again and faltering English,

924
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:41,580
a voice inquired who we were
firmly.

925
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:46,410
The company sergeant major Huggins told
them, the polls seem to understand.

926
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,810
After a few seconds of
audible consultation,

927
00:58:48,811 --> 00:58:51,180
they rose to their feet and walked across.

928
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:58,120
So you've got to be just a
chaotic situation. The polls land,

929
00:58:58,121 --> 00:59:00,100
they're getting attacked from
all directions and sure enough,

930
00:59:00,101 --> 00:59:05,101
they're shooting at the friendly forces
blue on blue happening once he gets them

931
00:59:05,621 --> 00:59:07,570
settled down,
he's got some people,

932
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:11,560
some of these Polish folks that now
have no leadership. Back to the book,

933
00:59:11,561 --> 00:59:12,490
calling Douglas over.

934
00:59:12,491 --> 00:59:16,450
I told him that he now had a fourth
section in seven platoon and within a few

935
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:19,330
minutes the polls were digging hard
under the tutelage of their corporal.

936
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:23,300
The only comprehensible part of
whose name sounded like Peter.

937
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,540
The digging had hardly started.

938
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:30,530
When a jeep roared down the track and
the direction from the direction of the

939
00:59:30,531 --> 00:59:33,950
battalion headquarters as it breaked
to stop and the cover of the trees,

940
00:59:33,951 --> 00:59:36,860
Jimmy get gray,
jumped out and ran towards us.

941
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:38,990
Gray's news was startling.

942
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:43,370
We were all to withdraw to
Wolf Hasan in 15 minutes time.

943
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:50,030
One could not just stand up
and walk away from an enemy,

944
00:59:50,031 --> 00:59:52,250
right on one's heels in day light.

945
00:59:52,251 --> 00:59:56,750
The only way to withdraw was to move
by bounds with platoons and companies

946
00:59:56,751 --> 01:00:01,040
covering one another back.
Any other plan was madness.

947
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:04,610
Things over in the north must be bad
and deed for the colonel to be rushed in

948
01:00:04,611 --> 01:00:07,340
this way.
But Grey's instructions were unshakeable.

949
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,800
So they're digging in and are
getting ordered. Get out of here,

950
01:00:09,801 --> 01:00:13,310
we're going to leave. And he saying,
okay, that's fine, but guess what?

951
01:00:13,311 --> 01:00:15,860
Even when you leave and you still use
the fundamental principle of cover and

952
01:00:15,861 --> 01:00:17,540
move. Yeah, and that's
what he's wanting to do.

953
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:23,090
So now they're on the retreat
and here we go. Back to the book.

954
01:00:23,091 --> 01:00:27,080
The pace was far too quick.
Some men were all but running to keep up.

955
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:31,400
As I had expected, a little by little
cohesion, we're starting to break down.

956
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,630
Some of the men of the mortar platoon had
overtaken us despite the weight of the

957
01:00:35,631 --> 01:00:37,280
loads and we're mixed in among us.

958
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,910
There were two small groups from another
unit in the middle of seven platoon

959
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:44,600
from somewhere in the front, a
long way off. A Spandau spent sent,

960
01:00:44,601 --> 01:00:46,460
it's bullets flying harmlessly overhead,

961
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:49,040
but men were looking
apprehensive and flinching.

962
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:53,110
We were now under fire from two
different directions. At any minute.

963
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:56,990
The Bush would find the range and
then the slaughter would begin.

964
01:00:57,770 --> 01:00:59,690
It was no longer an orderly retreat.

965
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:03,770
The withdrawal was taking on the nature
of a hoard of men seeking safety.

966
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:08,330
Soon discipline would crack and
everyone would start to run.

967
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,221
What a target.

968
01:01:10,221 --> 01:01:15,221
We must be some 500 men from four to
five different units rapidly coalescing

969
01:01:16,161 --> 01:01:19,760
into a solid moving mass.
Yeah.

970
01:01:19,761 --> 01:01:24,320
This is just a nightmare
and you can imagine it's an
individual thing and you're

971
01:01:24,321 --> 01:01:25,940
going to see some great
leadership examples,

972
01:01:25,941 --> 01:01:30,941
but it's an individual thing because if
you can keep the teams working together,

973
01:01:31,011 --> 01:01:33,950
covering and moving for each other,
that's good.

974
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:35,780
You're going to keep
the enemies heads down.

975
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:39,200
But if w if people in the group
starts saying, you know what,

976
01:01:39,201 --> 01:01:40,770
I'm not going to cover.
I'm going to run. Yeah,

977
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:45,200
and now no one's covering and now you've
got a bunch of people that are moving

978
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:47,360
and no cover and that's when
you're going to get slaughtered.

979
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:51,770
Not only going to get slaughtered by
by people that are shooting at you,

980
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:55,070
but if you're not putting down cover fire,
the enemy maneuvers,

981
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,220
they don't just sit there.
I mean some of them we shooting,

982
01:01:58,221 --> 01:01:58,821
but there'll be shooting,

983
01:01:58,821 --> 01:02:01,370
but other elements of them are going to
move and they're going to be able to cut

984
01:02:01,371 --> 01:02:02,204
you off.

985
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:07,910
They finally do make it back and they get
it. They get a little bit of luck here.

986
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:11,090
Here we go. Back to the book, we
caught our breath in the wood so they,

987
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:11,933
they get to a woods.

988
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:16,100
David's men had disappeared and there
was no sign of the kernel or of the

989
01:02:16,101 --> 01:02:20,130
battalion headquarters. No one had
followed us. We the last across,

990
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,650
but a quick check told me
that only Robert Watson,

991
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:27,180
the CSM and three or four other men were
missing in addition to seven bill toone

992
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:30,240
of the ladder.
There was nothing to be seen in all.

993
01:02:30,241 --> 01:02:32,160
There were still about 50 men with me.

994
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:36,270
Not Counting Peter and his seven poles
still clinging tenaciously to us.

995
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:42,310
Perhaps I should try to get back across
the bullet spattered embankment to find

996
01:02:42,311 --> 01:02:43,750
out what had happened to the others.

997
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:47,060
But the noise of the
battle was getting louder.

998
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:52,580
The Boesch must be closing in the vital
thing must be to rejoin the rest of the

999
01:02:52,581 --> 01:02:56,330
battalion with the 50 men I still
had and not to leave them in loop.

1000
01:02:56,331 --> 01:03:00,770
Tyler's charge while I returned on
what could be a foolhardy errand,

1001
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:06,590
but it was difficult to avoid the
thought that perhaps I was reluctant,

1002
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:09,770
reluctant to climb back over
the top of that embankment.

1003
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:14,060
So he,
he does make it to this woods,

1004
01:03:14,061 --> 01:03:16,730
but he didn't have everybody with
him and he's questioning himself,

1005
01:03:16,790 --> 01:03:20,000
should I go back over
there and risk it or not?

1006
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:23,520
And part of is part of his
rationalizing, you know, I,

1007
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,430
the best thing to do is get back
with the rest of the Italian.

1008
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:28,910
But part of him is saying,
you're rationalizing this and you're just,

1009
01:03:28,911 --> 01:03:33,110
you're just not, you're, you're
being a coward. But he does. He,

1010
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:35,300
he proceeds on with Italian.
He knows he's going to get killed.

1011
01:03:35,301 --> 01:03:39,800
If he goes over that, he can hear the
enemy coming. So back to the book,

1012
01:03:39,801 --> 01:03:44,000
10 minutes later, we found the remnants
of the battalion, half of a company,

1013
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:48,410
the mortars and what was left of the
machine guns were still were missing as

1014
01:03:48,411 --> 01:03:49,850
well as our own seven platoon.

1015
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:54,590
More than one third of the men who had
withdrawn from the woods had failed

1016
01:03:54,591 --> 01:03:59,510
across the railway. We were now down to
no more than a couple of hundred men.

1017
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:03,283
Okay,

1018
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:04,760
so we're going,

1019
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:09,820
we're down to a couple of hundred men
from five or 600 men in the battalion,

1020
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,070
maybe even a little bit more,

1021
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:14,260
maybe there might have been
700 men in the battalion.

1022
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:18,250
They get word once again.

1023
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:21,070
Here's what's going to happen
tomorrow at first light,

1024
01:04:21,071 --> 01:04:25,030
the brigade would move on to booster
beak to join the rest of the division,

1025
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:30,340
but unless ammunition together with air
and artillery support was forthcoming,

1026
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:34,060
the prospects were far from good.
We were,

1027
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:38,380
it seemed not opposed by
a few third line troops.

1028
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:43,750
Elements of three SS Panzer divisions
had been identified in the battle.

1029
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:48,250
The Germans seemed to have moved quickly
or else something had gone wrong with

1030
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:49,150
the intelligence.

1031
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:52,720
It was not surprising that the days
fighting had been so very bitter,

1032
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:55,900
so they're pointing out that they
weren't going against, you know,

1033
01:04:55,901 --> 01:04:59,500
third rate troops. They were going
up against ss Panzer divisions,

1034
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:04,450
the best of the German soldiers.
In talking with

1035
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:09,370
sergeant major bower and Sergeant Nesbitt,

1036
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,220
before I reached Tyler's platoon,

1037
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:14,980
I had done my best to be
as cheerful as possible,

1038
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:18,880
but it was plain that the two [inaudible]
realized that I was making the best of

1039
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:21,910
things. With Luke Tyler. It was different.

1040
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:27,250
I could not insult him by trying
to disguise our straights.

1041
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:31,840
I just told them the facts as I
had received them from the kernel.

1042
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:35,410
Possibly it was a mistake.
Quite suddenly,

1043
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:40,090
the failure of it all oppressed me.
In less than 36 hours,

1044
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,520
two thirds of the battalion had gone,

1045
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:48,400
15 rifle company officers had landed.
Only two were left.

1046
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:52,240
10 for certain had either
been killed or wounded.

1047
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:57,070
The chances of surviving another day.
We're small fatigue and a hunger.

1048
01:05:57,071 --> 01:06:00,550
It drained me.
There was a need to unburden myself.

1049
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:05,680
Luke was junior in my rank, but
equal in years. And in any case,

1050
01:06:05,681 --> 01:06:09,400
it was easier to confide in someone
who was, in many ways a stranger.

1051
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:14,610
Even as I spoke,
I was ashamed of this weakness,

1052
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:18,960
but there was no stopping quietly.

1053
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:24,380
Luke gave me the reassurance I needed the
iron needed to sustain oneself through

1054
01:06:25,201 --> 01:06:27,030
such a day was easily expended.

1055
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:30,270
And I felt that I had
purloined some of Luke share.

1056
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,890
So he, he basically on loads to one
of his guys or to want to another, uh,

1057
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:43,000
another officer below him in rank. But
what I think is interesting about this is

1058
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:47,540
he needed someone to talk to.

1059
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:51,200
He knew he was holding it all inside
and wasn't saying anything and trying to

1060
01:06:51,201 --> 01:06:53,690
look positive. And even he's looking
at his guys as he's telling them,

1061
01:06:53,691 --> 01:06:56,060
don't worry gents, we're going to be okay.
And his guys are looking at him like,

1062
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:59,810
Hey, no, we don't believe
you. And so he has to,

1063
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:03,050
he feels the need to unload on
someone. And that's why, you know,

1064
01:07:03,051 --> 01:07:05,700
I just think from my perspective,
you know,

1065
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:09,800
we always talk about relationships that
you have on your team and for sure in

1066
01:07:09,801 --> 01:07:11,540
your platoon or in your team,

1067
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:15,440
it's really good to have someone that
you can just kind of unload on that,

1068
01:07:15,441 --> 01:07:15,741
you know,

1069
01:07:15,741 --> 01:07:19,790
is professional enough to bolster you up
without getting dragged down into your

1070
01:07:19,791 --> 01:07:24,290
negativity.
And a lot of times I've found if,

1071
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:25,910
if you have someone like that,

1072
01:07:25,911 --> 01:07:28,430
or maybe a couple people like that
and your team that you can talk to,

1073
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:29,533
well guess what?

1074
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:34,760
Sometimes they're going to be bolstering
your attitude and sometimes you're

1075
01:07:34,761 --> 01:07:37,560
going to be bolstering their attitude.
And so you gotta,

1076
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:41,210
you gotta find someone like that that's
in your team that you can say, man,

1077
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:44,660
this is, this is horrible,
this is going wrong. And that
someone's going to go, hey,

1078
01:07:44,661 --> 01:07:47,120
you know what? It's not that bad. We're
going to get through it. And then through,

1079
01:07:47,121 --> 01:07:49,310
or three days later, he might
become to you and saying, Hey,

1080
01:07:49,311 --> 01:07:51,560
this is a horrible situation that I can't
believe this. And you're going to say,

1081
01:07:51,561 --> 01:07:55,760
no man, we're going to be all right. So
I think it's important and that's again,

1082
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:56,960
we're building relationships,

1083
01:07:56,961 --> 01:07:59,390
but that's one of the reasons
we build relationships.

1084
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:07,030
They get into a holdup position.
Back to the book on stand two rounds,

1085
01:08:07,031 --> 01:08:09,760
I found the Polish trenches
empty except for Peter there.

1086
01:08:09,761 --> 01:08:12,240
Corporal crouched grimly behind his brand,

1087
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:17,470
the rest of the party advantaged in the
early hours sensing perhaps a day at

1088
01:08:17,471 --> 01:08:19,490
attach themselves to an unlucky unit.

1089
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:23,280
Peter explained nothing
but as embarrassment.

1090
01:08:23,281 --> 01:08:28,281
It was clear it was both unfair and
pointless to press him for details when

1091
01:08:28,341 --> 01:08:32,480
either pride or sense of duty had kept
him there to fight among strangers.

1092
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:37,400
The fault of what would have happened if
the enemy at attack from this direction

1093
01:08:37,401 --> 01:08:40,700
against the position held by
one solitary man was chilling.

1094
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:47,390
It was a mistake to trust strangers
I had learned yet another lesson.

1095
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:50,420
Rely on only those you knew.

1096
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:58,580
Again, it's interesting how he sometimes
backs off. Instead of pressing w,

1097
01:08:58,610 --> 01:09:01,550
where are your guys? He knows, he's
like, what? What point is that?

1098
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:04,400
Or when Bartholomew was,
was running away,

1099
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:06,890
he didn't press him super hard and
you're going to get to a point,

1100
01:09:06,891 --> 01:09:08,630
there's pointing to here
when he does press people,

1101
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:11,000
but here he's decided
he's not going to do it.

1102
01:09:11,001 --> 01:09:14,830
And the other interesting thing is here
it says, I learned another lesson rely,

1103
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:17,510
you know, not distrust
strangers relying on only those,

1104
01:09:17,511 --> 01:09:22,280
you know what you have to do in those
situations is you have to put someone that

1105
01:09:22,281 --> 01:09:25,970
you do trust in bed them with
these units that you don't know.

1106
01:09:26,690 --> 01:09:28,880
So if you would have taken,
and he gave these,

1107
01:09:28,881 --> 01:09:32,330
he gave that section to one of his
platoon commanders and said, hey,

1108
01:09:32,331 --> 01:09:33,350
you got another section now,

1109
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:38,450
but maybe in bed one more guy or two
more guys in there or split these guys up

1110
01:09:38,451 --> 01:09:41,870
even more. So instead of seven and one
big bulk, you put two or three there,

1111
01:09:41,871 --> 01:09:42,291
two or three,

1112
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:45,050
there are two or three there and now you
split them up a little bit and you can

1113
01:09:45,051 --> 01:09:48,650
have better control over them.
Yeah, it's weird. There's, you know,

1114
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:52,760
there's opportunity to dessert though.
And these guys took the opportunity. Sure.

1115
01:09:56,780 --> 01:10:01,780
Now the fighting rages on and obviously
I have to fast forward through some of

1116
01:10:05,121 --> 01:10:08,780
it and they eventually get
into of little village,

1117
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:11,570
a little small village and they've,
they've taken down,

1118
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:16,600
they've taken some buildings and here we
go there in these buildings back to the

1119
01:10:18,261 --> 01:10:22,970
book, we were in a mess. The Boesch
were on the other side of the valley,

1120
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,370
outnumbered and outgunned us.

1121
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:26,930
Okay.

1122
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:31,220
There was not the slightest
hope of reaching the back
of the breed line this way

1123
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:35,510
and to stay here on this Ford
slope was impossible at this rate,

1124
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:38,990
we would all be dead or wounded soon.

1125
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:40,300
Okay?

1126
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:43,960
Somehow I had to get the survivors
back up the hill, but it was near,

1127
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:48,940
but it was a near in Superbowl problem
with the men scattered down among the

1128
01:10:48,941 --> 01:10:52,660
houses, lawns and shrubberies
shot at every time they moved.

1129
01:10:53,770 --> 01:10:56,950
Someone called from the side of the house.
As I turned and looked private,

1130
01:10:56,951 --> 01:11:01,951
Gregory darted across to throw himself
down beside me under the dirt and two

1131
01:11:03,231 --> 01:11:06,670
days scrub of beard.
His face was grayish white.

1132
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:09,010
He seemed about to vomit

1133
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:15,090
as Gregory stammered out his platoon
commanders. I knew what had happened.

1134
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,580
Lieutenant Tyler was dead.

1135
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:22,140
It must have happened
just after we parted.

1136
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:25,080
Luke had been killed on
the steep garden path,

1137
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:28,830
which led from the house down the
road. He'd, he'd been hit by a sniper,

1138
01:11:29,070 --> 01:11:31,200
killed outright by a
bullet through the heart.

1139
01:11:31,201 --> 01:11:33,840
We did a couple of yards of the
place where Gregory was lying.

1140
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:38,270
Possibly Luke had been careless
because he was still dazed,

1141
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:41,960
but he had to get back to his platoon
and the path was his only route.

1142
01:11:41,961 --> 01:11:46,961
So they had been together and they'd been
hit by a some kind of artillery in the

1143
01:11:47,901 --> 01:11:49,070
house and it rattled them.

1144
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:53,690
And then Luke had gone out to get back
back to his platoon and when he left,

1145
01:11:53,691 --> 01:11:56,510
he got shot by a sniper back to the book.

1146
01:11:56,690 --> 01:12:01,400
This was how officers and ntls were
killed just doing their routine job.

1147
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:06,260
This was why casualties among the leaders
were so high all the time that they

1148
01:12:06,261 --> 01:12:10,790
were moving about checking here,
encouraging their backwards and forwards.

1149
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,340
Now besides myself and
only the quartermaster,

1150
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:20,000
sergeant bower and
Sergeant Weiner were left,

1151
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:24,290
all the rest of the officers and
sergeants and the company had gone.

1152
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:27,180
One problem,
however,

1153
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:30,720
had been solved the remnants of Tyler's
to forward sections had mannered,

1154
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:34,440
managed to extricate themselves
without waiting for orders.

1155
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:36,540
Since last night,

1156
01:12:36,541 --> 01:12:39,150
private Gregory had been in charge
of one of the other sections,

1157
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:44,300
both the ncls having been hit the day
before during that last mortar stock,

1158
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:48,540
a bomb and fallen right on top of the
corporal who's commanding the other

1159
01:12:48,541 --> 01:12:52,290
section, blowing him and his
brand gunner half to pieces.

1160
01:12:53,550 --> 01:12:58,320
Commonsense had told us survivors to quit
and there had been no one to stop them

1161
01:12:58,321 --> 01:12:59,370
except Gregory,

1162
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:02,790
who for the moment was shaken by the
sight of what had happened to his friends

1163
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:06,030
and who in any case lack the
authority to hold them there.

1164
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:10,830
No one else had been hit and scrambled
back and the survivors were now

1165
01:13:10,831 --> 01:13:12,600
sheltering in the house.

1166
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:21,323
Okay,

1167
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:24,730
so they're in these houses and,

1168
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:28,420
and for the first time you're going
to hear the company commander start to

1169
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:32,410
realize he's got people at the
breaking point. Back to the book.

1170
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:35,950
The others were as uneasy
as I was for the first time.

1171
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:39,520
I was unhappy about them until now.

1172
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:42,100
They'd endured the success of disasters,

1173
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:45,070
but the events of the morning
had tried them too far.

1174
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:49,950
It had been yesterday, once
again, yet another failure,

1175
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:53,130
failure against an enemy who
is far too strong for us.

1176
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:58,770
Men we're looking jittery. Some could
be well near their breaking point.

1177
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,960
As I gazed down the slope, trying to
spot some activity among the Bush,

1178
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:07,410
a movement to the right caught
my eye about 20 yards away.

1179
01:14:07,411 --> 01:14:10,530
Two of Kelly's men were
moving diagonally behind me,

1180
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,910
sheltered the far side of the ridge.

1181
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:14,280
Okay,

1182
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,770
these are, these are desert, hers.

1183
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:22,070
My shout made them hesitate and then
stop after two or three more steps for

1184
01:14:22,171 --> 01:14:25,170
getting the enemy,
I stood up and strode down towards them.

1185
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:31,060
No explanation was necessary.
The surly guilt on their faces was enough.

1186
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:36,370
Deliberately choosing words for effect.
I cursed them in language,

1187
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:38,890
rarely used by officers
towards their soldiers.

1188
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:40,280
Okay.

1189
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:44,840
It was enough. The two men turned
back towards their platoon.

1190
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:48,453
Okay.

1191
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:52,420
So like I said, sometimes he or if
they're there, he's dropping the hammer.

1192
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:56,410
These two guys are trying to dessert and
he goes on and drops the hammer on them

1193
01:14:56,411 --> 01:14:59,950
and gets them back with their platoon.
Back to the book. In this mood,

1194
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:02,440
the men would never stand
up to an enemy attack.

1195
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:07,360
Even a mortar stock could break them.
I could see it happening.

1196
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:12,420
First one or two men would slip away like
the two I had just stopped and then a

1197
01:15:12,421 --> 01:15:16,090
rush would follow.
Something drastic had to be done.

1198
01:15:16,870 --> 01:15:20,470
No more than the occasional rifle
bullet was now coming over. In fact,

1199
01:15:20,471 --> 01:15:23,440
no one had been hit since we took
our positions along this rich,

1200
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:27,820
it seems safe enough standing up.

1201
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:32,530
I began to walk along the path
towards the left of our position.

1202
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:36,520
For the first few steps.
I felt wretchedly vulnerable,

1203
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:41,170
but then an odd exoration seized me

1204
01:15:42,730 --> 01:15:46,570
for the first few steps.
I felt wretchedly vulnerable,

1205
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:51,930
but then an odd exhilaration seized
me not too slowly and not too quickly.

1206
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:57,960
I strode deliberately toward the first
group of men grinning down at Lance

1207
01:15:58,360 --> 01:15:58,450
Corporal Williams.

1208
01:15:58,450 --> 01:16:02,440
I made some inept remark about it being
the wrong place for a company. Clark,

1209
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:06,950
if I were to be hit,
it would happen anyway.

1210
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:11,900
Now seem to be as good a time as
ever stopping at each group of men.

1211
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:15,590
I checked their firing positions and
made necessary changes that I was at the

1212
01:16:15,591 --> 01:16:19,610
end of Kelly's line and I started back
conscious that everyone was watching.

1213
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:23,360
There was a burst of machine gun fire,
well wide of us,

1214
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:27,200
but I managed to avoid flinching at it.
Suddenly,

1215
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:30,680
sergeant we whiners
voice harsh with concern,

1216
01:16:30,681 --> 01:16:35,681
was yelling at me to get down demanding
angrily what I was playing at the spell

1217
01:16:36,441 --> 01:16:40,490
broke. I was grateful for the excuse
to lower myself down beside him,

1218
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,140
very relieved that it was over

1219
01:16:43,670 --> 01:16:47,480
the rage and winders face
dissolved into an on a custom grin.

1220
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:52,070
The corny dramatics were over,
but they had served their purpose.

1221
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:55,010
The men had got a grip on themselves.

1222
01:16:55,580 --> 01:16:59,420
So he basically stood
up and walked around and

1223
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:05,240
talked to everyone and made himself
visible and made himself appear to not be

1224
01:17:05,241 --> 01:17:10,241
scared to get the guys heads back in the
day until his sergeant winder yells at

1225
01:17:12,411 --> 01:17:17,150
him and says, hey dude, get down when
these guys, these are like the desert is,

1226
01:17:17,151 --> 01:17:20,420
where did they go so they
can head back towards,

1227
01:17:20,421 --> 01:17:24,770
towards the areas that had been secured.
So as this beach edge, you know,

1228
01:17:24,771 --> 01:17:28,880
we landed d day,
June 6th this is now in September.

1229
01:17:28,881 --> 01:17:31,580
So you know,
coalition forces or or sorry,

1230
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:35,750
allied forces had pushed into France.
So if you could walk back,

1231
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:38,970
you could eventually get too
friendly lines. Yeah. And that's,

1232
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,470
that's what their plan was.
And then what that when you get there,

1233
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:46,130
don't they know, hey you do 30 days, you'd
say, all right. You know, you'd say, Oh,

1234
01:17:46,131 --> 01:17:49,620
I was, I got separated from
my chops when I parachuted in.

1235
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,350
I couldn't find my people or whatever.

1236
01:17:51,351 --> 01:17:55,850
You make up your lie and you deal with
it later with it later because right now

1237
01:17:55,851 --> 01:17:57,090
you're thinking I'm not going to make it

1238
01:17:58,160 --> 01:17:59,930
the crazy,

1239
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:02,750
it was clear why nothing.

1240
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:05,990
We had heard nothing from battalion
headquarters for the past two hours.

1241
01:18:05,991 --> 01:18:07,370
Like everyone else,
the signal,

1242
01:18:07,570 --> 01:18:11,690
the signalers orderlies and clerks had
been fighting for their own survival.

1243
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:15,950
The Germans were all around them and had
been pressing them hard throughout the

1244
01:18:15,950 --> 01:18:19,370
morning so they're not getting any
information about what's happening.

1245
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:24,630
This is, this is interesting.
He goes back to get they,

1246
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:28,130
they ended up with a little extra
ammunition and he goes back to get some

1247
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:29,900
ammunition from the battalion.

1248
01:18:29,901 --> 01:18:32,540
They haven't got it like stage in the
battalion headquarters and and how's he's

1249
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,800
doing this?
He is,

1250
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:39,020
the ammunition was in a jeep
and so he goes to the jeep,

1251
01:18:39,021 --> 01:18:43,760
he finds the jeep and he's with one of
his other guys and they're the regimental

1252
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:48,320
sergeant major is sitting basically on
top of the jeep on top of the ammunition

1253
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:54,500
and he kind of is looking at
the guy, you know, saying,

1254
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:58,460
Hey, I'm here. I'm an all
star. I got paltunes out
there and a company out there,

1255
01:18:58,461 --> 01:19:00,650
I got to get them ammunition
and he doesn't really move.

1256
01:19:00,651 --> 01:19:05,150
He just kind of sits
there. Hmm. And so finally,

1257
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:08,180
uh,
here he was here,

1258
01:19:08,181 --> 01:19:12,260
the regimental Sergeant Major was in
the middle of battle sitting on his arse

1259
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:17,120
and taking his ease while a company
commander hunted for ammunition majors are

1260
01:19:17,121 --> 01:19:21,230
not in the habit of rebuking regimental
sergeant majors, but this was too much.

1261
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:24,560
The tensions of the morning.
It's snapped myself for spray restraint.

1262
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:27,890
And in a couple of succinct sentences,
I told the RS,

1263
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:30,260
the regimental sergeant
major what I thought of him.

1264
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:32,550
Okay.

1265
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:35,340
Then the row,
the regimental sergeant major apologized,

1266
01:19:35,850 --> 01:19:40,680
but he did not move without any trace
of irony or annoyance in his voice.

1267
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:44,430
He quietly explained that he could not
stand up because he had been shot through

1268
01:19:44,431 --> 01:19:45,360
both legs.

1269
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:50,190
I had not noticed the airborne smock
with which someone had covered his

1270
01:19:50,191 --> 01:19:52,710
outstretched and bandaged legs.

1271
01:19:57,210 --> 01:19:57,740
Thanks.
I think

1272
01:19:57,740 --> 01:19:58,820
before you act

1273
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:05,960
now they're on their way. They're
heading finally to this area of Ooh,

1274
01:20:05,961 --> 01:20:09,480
stir beak there on their patrol.
And here we go.

1275
01:20:09,570 --> 01:20:13,590
Back to the book of Spandau opening
up ahead, sent us all to the ground.

1276
01:20:13,591 --> 01:20:17,730
Men diving for cover just a little
too quickly on a moment later,

1277
01:20:17,731 --> 01:20:20,400
a second gun fired on us from the right,
but it was the,

1278
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:24,690
it was the ominous rattle
of the tracked vehicles,

1279
01:20:24,691 --> 01:20:28,500
which chilled the first one than another.

1280
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:31,290
Then two more quite close and in front.

1281
01:20:31,291 --> 01:20:35,100
Their engine clatter rising above the
din of the machine, guns and rifles.

1282
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:40,290
Then some 70 yards away.
I saw the first of the SP guns.

1283
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:45,000
It's stubby weapon traversing slowly
towards us. Sp guns are there.

1284
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:47,580
They're kind of like tanks.
It's, it's self propelled guns.

1285
01:20:47,581 --> 01:20:49,800
They're like artillery
pieces with tracks on them.

1286
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:55,800
The flash from its stout from it's now,
it was one of,

1287
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:59,010
with the explosion of the bursting shell,
just to the right,

1288
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:01,770
a half grown tree shattered
in a jagged splinters,

1289
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:06,480
a second shot following hard on the first
one covered Harrison and me with earth.

1290
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:11,250
We were swamped by the noise.
Every sort of weapons seemed to be firing.

1291
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,570
Grenades were exploding,

1292
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:16,410
but the distinct above the rest was
the clank and the throaty cough of the

1293
01:21:16,411 --> 01:21:19,620
armored guns caught
like this and the open.

1294
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:24,770
We were helpless tanks plowing among
about among us could have been no worse.

1295
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:28,050
There was no way of fighting back.

1296
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:32,430
No one does seem to have even a PR which
is like their Bazooka anti armor weapon

1297
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:35,610
and we could not get close
enough to use the gammon bombs.

1298
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:40,170
The bags of plastic explosive carried
for the for use against armor,

1299
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:41,730
so that's another little,
it's like a big

1300
01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:47,460
bag of explosives that you can put on a,
on a armored vehicle to destroy it.

1301
01:21:47,461 --> 01:21:52,200
They call them gammon bombs. The
men in front, we're moving again.

1302
01:21:52,201 --> 01:21:57,030
I stood up and signaled those behind
to follow. We were doubling now,

1303
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:58,710
but there was still some sort of control.

1304
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:03,540
We were not running away but making
for somewhere where I did not know.

1305
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,650
Then about a hundred yards away,

1306
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:14,280
I caught a glimpse through the
trees have a German half track.

1307
01:22:14,281 --> 01:22:17,460
It stopped and helmeted
shapes jump from its sides.

1308
01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:21,630
How many more of them were there?
This could be the start of another attack,

1309
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:27,060
which could only end it all our will
to fight back was all but broken.

1310
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:30,120
Then I heard the Brig,

1311
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:34,830
the brigadier telling me to clear the
enemy out of the hollow after which the

1312
01:22:34,831 --> 01:22:38,550
survivors of the brigade
would join us there c company,

1313
01:22:38,551 --> 01:22:41,820
it seemed was the last
organized body of troops,

1314
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:46,170
so they're looking at this area,
this open area where there's some enemy,

1315
01:22:46,171 --> 01:22:48,600
but it looks like it's a good position.
Of course,

1316
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:53,190
their will to fight is just about broken
and you hear the brigadier is saying,

1317
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:57,420
Hey, take your company and
clear out that hollow. Go

1318
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:00,510
back to the book for a moment.

1319
01:23:00,511 --> 01:23:04,530
I was so dumbfounded that I hardly heard
the brigadier going on to say that the

1320
01:23:04,531 --> 01:23:07,750
brigade major was dead as well.
Killed about five minutes ago.

1321
01:23:08,510 --> 01:23:10,750
Another friend was gone,
but I hardly listened.

1322
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:15,280
What was the brigadier ordering us to
do and his quiet and determined fashion.

1323
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:19,810
It was absurd. The men were
finished. Only a few minutes ago,

1324
01:23:19,811 --> 01:23:22,450
I had realized that they were
passed defending themselves.

1325
01:23:22,930 --> 01:23:26,320
Now we were being told to
assault that Boesch position.

1326
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:30,910
The brigadiers look was both
quizzical and encouraging.

1327
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:35,800
The confounded man could see
what was passing through my mind.

1328
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:41,230
Then I was away dodging back and through
the bushes towards the men in the ditch.

1329
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:46,380
Even more aware than ever before of the
bullets singing overhead with my back to

1330
01:23:46,601 --> 01:23:48,640
a broad tree which hit
me from the enemy front.

1331
01:23:48,910 --> 01:23:51,040
I looked down at the upturn faces.

1332
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:56,640
There was no point in wasting at
all in wasting time on details.

1333
01:23:58,210 --> 01:24:00,310
The orders I had to give them more,
quite simple,

1334
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:04,150
devoid of any complications such
as who would provide covering fire.

1335
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:06,610
It was time for play,
acting again,

1336
01:24:07,030 --> 01:24:11,200
my naturally loud voice carrying down
the line of men and Bung above the sound

1337
01:24:11,201 --> 01:24:14,200
of battles.
I balled them to follow me.

1338
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:18,580
Adding the comment that is better to be
killed going for the basters than lying

1339
01:24:18,581 --> 01:24:23,390
in that bloody ditch.
No one has a stated.

1340
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:26,240
The men rose to their feet.
At the moment,

1341
01:24:26,241 --> 01:24:29,510
I stepped out into the open from
behind the shelter of the tree.

1342
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:33,800
Glancing to my right. I was exhilarated
by the sight of David Unwin.

1343
01:24:33,801 --> 01:24:38,801
Solid bulk running parallel to me and
half a dozen of his men following David

1344
01:24:39,891 --> 01:24:42,530
shouted something to the effect
that they were coming as well.

1345
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:46,910
And I waved my sten gone and
acknowledgement behind me.

1346
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,440
Sergeant Winder broke into a
scream of rage, harsh and furious.

1347
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:57,130
The yell spread down the line too
heavily laden and too tired to sprint.

1348
01:24:57,410 --> 01:25:00,800
We lumbered forward towards the
enemy and a sort of jog trot.

1349
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:06,850
Now, I was careless of everything.
We did not stand a chance,

1350
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:09,010
but this was the right way to go.

1351
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:14,610
This was the proper way to finish it all.
Nearly hysterical.

1352
01:25:14,611 --> 01:25:18,930
Now with rage and excitement, I heard
my own voice join in the screaming.

1353
01:25:20,190 --> 01:25:21,690
The Germans were shooting at us.

1354
01:25:21,810 --> 01:25:25,380
I could see flashes of their weapons
springing out of the gloom of the trees.

1355
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:28,950
There was no need to look back to
confirm that the line of men was still

1356
01:25:28,951 --> 01:25:31,290
following the noise
told me they were there.

1357
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:35,160
Now the boats were no
more than 50 yards away.

1358
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:38,400
As I brought my sten down to hip level,
depress the trigger.

1359
01:25:38,490 --> 01:25:41,550
They flashed through my mind that it was
the first time I had fired my weapon.

1360
01:25:41,551 --> 01:25:45,390
Since the battle started my
four fingers squeeze the metal,

1361
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,760
nothing happened.
It had jammed.

1362
01:25:48,450 --> 01:25:52,890
Here I was running toward the enemy with
a useless piece of metal in my hands.

1363
01:25:53,910 --> 01:25:54,270
Yeah.

1364
01:25:54,270 --> 01:25:56,610
There were figures moving among the trees.
First,

1365
01:25:56,611 --> 01:26:00,090
a couple than a half dozen dark
shapes were outlined against the green

1366
01:26:00,091 --> 01:26:03,770
background. Men sprinting away,
men disappearing through the trees.

1367
01:26:03,890 --> 01:26:07,490
The boats were running away.
We had done it.

1368
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:13,300
We had driven the enemy out at the point
of bay and that this was the ultimate

1369
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,593
in war.

1370
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:20,120
The site of the savage screaming
parachute is streaming towards them,

1371
01:26:20,121 --> 01:26:21,650
had been too much for the Germans,

1372
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:27,340
even though they had to do nothing
more than keep their heads and shoot

1373
01:26:27,561 --> 01:26:28,394
straight.

1374
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:36,560
Yeah. So there you go. Surrounded, broken.

1375
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:38,300
And I think the key point here,

1376
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:40,330
okay.

1377
01:26:40,330 --> 01:26:44,770
When you're think you're
broken, do something and do
something aggressive. Yeah.

1378
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:48,400
That's, that's The d. This is, this is
a hundred percent default aggressive.

1379
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:51,430
That's what this is. You know what?
We're here. We're being defensive.

1380
01:26:51,431 --> 01:26:54,340
We're hiding in our slit trenches.
Okay. You know what we're going to do?

1381
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:58,360
We're going to attack. We're
going to attack full force. Yeah.

1382
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:02,800
Back to the book. The sight of David
on the right added to my delight,

1383
01:27:03,610 --> 01:27:05,620
shouting to him to hold
the right of the hollow.

1384
01:27:05,621 --> 01:27:08,200
I directed Sergeant
Weiner round to the left.

1385
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:10,240
There was no need to tell anyone to hurry.

1386
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:14,080
They all knew that the Germans would
not delay in mounting a counter attack.

1387
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:19,210
Umone of terror distracted me.
I turned to the wounded German.

1388
01:27:19,390 --> 01:27:23,290
The man's features were contorted
into a rictus of despair.

1389
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:29,820
Above him stood sergeant major Kelly red
eyed and panting his band that raised

1390
01:27:31,361 --> 01:27:35,590
above the soldiers stomach,
but Kelly did not strike.

1391
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:40,450
He was relishing the moment snatching
maximum pleasure from the wounded man's

1392
01:27:40,451 --> 01:27:43,660
anguish before he sliced it
sliced into the soft belly.

1393
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:49,030
As my newly found mouser
knocked the bayonet to one side,

1394
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:54,070
the sergeant major smelled at me in an
unspoken protest at such silly scruples.

1395
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:57,080
Then he seemed to shake himself.

1396
01:27:57,740 --> 01:28:01,700
The blood lust has bad past did.
He came to his senses,

1397
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,830
gathering his men to the
defenses. So again, he could,

1398
01:28:06,831 --> 01:28:11,831
this guy goes from the pure fury
and rage of this incredible bayonet,

1399
01:28:12,130 --> 01:28:12,963
all salt,

1400
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:17,920
and then he immediately just puts his
one of his sergeant majors in check who's

1401
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:21,110
about to, you know, rent
ruthlessly killed this wounded guy.

1402
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:24,520
Very interesting dichotomy there.

1403
01:28:24,610 --> 01:28:25,443
Mm hmm.

1404
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:31,820
Back to the book. Something
had been snatched back from
the disasters of the day.

1405
01:28:32,330 --> 01:28:35,390
The remnants of the brigade headquarters
together with a few stragglers from

1406
01:28:35,391 --> 01:28:37,880
other units had now all arrived in all,

1407
01:28:37,881 --> 01:28:42,830
there seemed to be about 150 men with
a half a dozen officers as well as the

1408
01:28:42,830 --> 01:28:44,720
Brigadier David and myself.
There was Jimmy Gray.

1409
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:48,560
The latter brought news that
the colonel was probably dead,

1410
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:53,030
although he could not be sure as they'd
become separated during a scrimmage with

1411
01:28:53,031 --> 01:28:58,031
an sp gun of the rest of the officers
who had jumped with a battalion captain

1412
01:28:58,881 --> 01:28:59,870
John Simmons.

1413
01:29:00,230 --> 01:29:04,350
The gunner forward observer
was the only left one left.

1414
01:29:09,090 --> 01:29:09,923
Okay.

1415
01:29:12,130 --> 01:29:14,980
Continuing.
After about 15 minutes,

1416
01:29:14,981 --> 01:29:18,580
a lowland shooting suggested that I might
now be able to get round to visit the

1417
01:29:18,581 --> 01:29:22,750
battalion positions.
The battalion for the first time,

1418
01:29:22,751 --> 01:29:27,610
it struck me that I was now in command
of what was left of it, pitiful remnants,

1419
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:28,990
but they are still fighting.

1420
01:29:30,310 --> 01:29:34,540
The brigadier had allotted the south
and west sides of the perimeter to us.

1421
01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:40,350
The first pit held sergeant wiener
with seven or eight men at the bottom.

1422
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:41,980
His eyes shut,

1423
01:29:42,230 --> 01:29:46,420
lay a gray faced and motionless private
Gregory shot through his stomach.

1424
01:29:47,490 --> 01:29:48,110
Okay.

1425
01:29:48,110 --> 01:29:51,580
Corporal Pritchard had bandaged him
up and give them a shot of Morphia,

1426
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:55,730
but because his airborne smock had
been pulled down over his blood stain

1427
01:29:55,731 --> 01:29:57,470
dressing to keep as warm as possible,

1428
01:29:57,471 --> 01:30:02,000
he laid there with no outward sign of
injury looking as a man might do who had

1429
01:30:02,001 --> 01:30:03,380
collapsed with exhaustion.

1430
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:09,130
Gregory's eyes opened when he
saw who was standing over him.

1431
01:30:09,310 --> 01:30:13,120
He asked for the favor.
His voice was quiet.

1432
01:30:13,330 --> 01:30:15,070
His words measured in coherent.

1433
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:19,420
His proposal quite logical out here.

1434
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,180
Without the help of a doctor,

1435
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:26,050
he was going to die in any case and
he could stand the pain no longer

1436
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:29,880
which someone please put
a bullet through his head.

1437
01:30:32,190 --> 01:30:36,960
For the moment my grip tightened
on the Mauser and Gregory State,

1438
01:30:37,170 --> 01:30:39,900
I probably would have been
asking for the same release.

1439
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:44,760
If it did happen, I hope that someone
would have the guts to give it to me.

1440
01:30:46,410 --> 01:30:50,880
Then I caught whiners.
I then he knew that I could not do it.

1441
01:30:52,570 --> 01:30:56,190
The only way to help Gregory was to
give him a further shot of more for Ya.

1442
01:30:56,350 --> 01:30:58,420
Dangerous though it would be to do so.

1443
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:03,550
As I reached for my own ampule
in the breast pocket of my smock,

1444
01:31:03,551 --> 01:31:08,350
I was ashamed by my reluctance.
The reason it was purely selfish,

1445
01:31:08,470 --> 01:31:10,930
sooner or later I might
want to use it on myself.

1446
01:31:10,990 --> 01:31:14,110
Wounded and alone behind a bush
with no one about to help me.

1447
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:17,530
But Sergeant Wiener came to the rescue.

1448
01:31:17,650 --> 01:31:22,650
He had scrounged a couple of supply of
ampules from somewhere or another opening

1449
01:31:23,981 --> 01:31:28,930
the small black tin. He Bared Gregory's
arm and pressed the needle home.

1450
01:31:31,130 --> 01:31:36,130
The words of sympathy and encouragement
sounded pitifully trite as I pressed

1451
01:31:36,141 --> 01:31:40,350
Gregory's shoulder,
nervous of any reproach,

1452
01:31:40,351 --> 01:31:41,400
which I might see.

1453
01:31:42,210 --> 01:31:46,230
I turned and walked away without
looking at the wound and man's face.

1454
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:01,390
My name was being called.

1455
01:32:03,190 --> 01:32:08,050
It was private Jones slithering towards
me down the opposite slope of the hollow.

1456
01:32:08,051 --> 01:32:09,400
Jones told me quickly,

1457
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:14,740
I was major Unwin killed by a sniper
shot through the forehead as he,

1458
01:32:14,741 --> 01:32:16,420
he's peering over the rim of the hollow,

1459
01:32:16,570 --> 01:32:19,390
trying to locate the whereabouts
of a span dough machine gun.

1460
01:32:21,330 --> 01:32:26,160
He died instantly. Jones was adamant.
There was no doubt that he was dead.

1461
01:32:26,820 --> 01:32:28,290
His brains had been blown out.

1462
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:34,050
Jones was urging me to come see his body,
but I could not bring myself to do so.

1463
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:40,830
David could not be dead.
They could not have killed David.

1464
01:32:40,950 --> 01:32:44,940
Everyone else, yes, one after
another, friends had died,

1465
01:32:44,941 --> 01:32:48,690
but I never believed that this
could happen in David. So vast,

1466
01:32:48,810 --> 01:32:52,800
so indestructable the humerus,
gentle David.

1467
01:32:55,630 --> 01:32:57,130
The brigadier was beside me.

1468
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:03,040
He had also heard the
news for nearly two years.

1469
01:33:03,130 --> 01:33:06,790
He had known us both and it was
playing that he understood the anguish,

1470
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,190
but there were other things to think about

1471
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:17,770
as we knew only too well.
The brigadier told us our ammunition.

1472
01:33:17,771 --> 01:33:22,080
It was nearly finished and as
her own fire slackened the enemy,

1473
01:33:22,081 --> 01:33:25,110
snipers were becoming bolder
and more men were being hit.

1474
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:30,630
Soon we would be forced to surrender,
so we had decided to take the initiative.

1475
01:33:31,650 --> 01:33:33,750
We would break out
towards the rooster beak,

1476
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:36,210
charging through the enemy and solid mass,

1477
01:33:36,270 --> 01:33:39,270
trusting our numbers and
impetus to get through.

1478
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:45,980
It was an extraordinary plan for the
second time that day the brigadier was

1479
01:33:46,411 --> 01:33:51,350
ordering us to do what seemed impossible,
but our trust and the brigadier,

1480
01:33:51,351 --> 01:33:54,390
his judgment was now implicit.
It was a gamble,

1481
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:57,270
but one which offered at
least a chance of success

1482
01:33:58,830 --> 01:34:01,890
to stay here would only one end one way.

1483
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:06,300
15 minutes later we were ready.

1484
01:34:07,470 --> 01:34:09,000
It could have been the start of a race.

1485
01:34:09,090 --> 01:34:12,450
The brigadier asked whether we were ready,
then add his shout.

1486
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:16,880
The hundred of us rose to our feet and
exploded in a solid mass over the lip of

1487
01:34:16,881 --> 01:34:21,881
a hollow in front was the brigadier
himself leading the way behind came the

1488
01:34:22,861 --> 01:34:27,300
yelling, screaming men filthy and
bloodstained weapons in their hands,

1489
01:34:27,390 --> 01:34:32,250
band nets, dull and menacing. A
fearful site to anyone in our path.

1490
01:34:33,630 --> 01:34:38,070
The German fire now seem to be coming from
every direction, but I saw no one hit.

1491
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:41,340
We were rushing downhill along us lane,

1492
01:34:41,490 --> 01:34:43,710
a solid human battering ram.

1493
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:50,020
The first wild play pay
slackened the firing stopped.

1494
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:51,543
We had done it.

1495
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:56,500
We were through the enemy and out
of the forest for the second time,

1496
01:34:56,501 --> 01:34:58,880
that day boldness to it saved us

1497
01:35:04,410 --> 01:35:09,090
once again, some default
aggressive activity. And,

1498
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:14,130
and I mean obviously I want to make it
clear that emboldened the both these

1499
01:35:14,131 --> 01:35:18,140
situations, it wasn't, it wasn't, uh,

1500
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:21,950
it wasn't a call of, hey,
there's a, there's a,

1501
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:26,060
there's a objective we want to reach.
Charge it.

1502
01:35:26,350 --> 01:35:27,183
Hmm.

1503
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:32,620
It was, we can either sit here and
do nothing and die or we can attack.

1504
01:35:32,930 --> 01:35:36,370
That's the, that's the big, I don't
want anyone out there thinking, okay,

1505
01:35:36,371 --> 01:35:38,200
I'm just going to,
every time default aggressive,

1506
01:35:38,201 --> 01:35:40,750
I'm going to run and
we're going to attack. No.

1507
01:35:41,290 --> 01:35:45,400
These are situations where the alternative
to attacking is is being defensive,

1508
01:35:45,401 --> 01:35:49,420
laying down and dying and continue to
get picked off and snipers until you get

1509
01:35:49,421 --> 01:35:50,410
overrun.
Yeah.

1510
01:35:52,050 --> 01:35:52,710
Okay.

1511
01:35:52,710 --> 01:35:57,000
Now they meet up with, finally they
meet up with these other British troops.

1512
01:35:59,410 --> 01:36:02,230
Back to the book. Someone was leading
us into a garden of a large house.

1513
01:36:02,231 --> 01:36:04,030
The men dropped to the
ground as they halted,

1514
01:36:04,031 --> 01:36:07,330
conscious that they were now safe with
houses and other British Air British

1515
01:36:07,331 --> 01:36:12,070
troops around them. Others after a
swig from a water bottle, lay supine,

1516
01:36:12,071 --> 01:36:16,000
unconscious. In instance,
sleep. I counted them.

1517
01:36:16,570 --> 01:36:17,403
Jimmy Gray,

1518
01:36:17,530 --> 01:36:22,530
John Simmons and sergeant wine or were
there sergeant major Kelly was missing.

1519
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:24,790
Someone had seen him fall in the rush.

1520
01:36:25,570 --> 01:36:30,570
There were just 49 other men about half
from c company last night there had been

1521
01:36:31,151 --> 01:36:34,690
200 the night before,
500

1522
01:36:42,450 --> 01:36:45,880
now they're in these positions
and

1523
01:36:47,850 --> 01:36:50,700
they're about to get attacked just
below in the garden, but out of sight.

1524
01:36:50,701 --> 01:36:53,910
Another brand opened up. It was Jimmy
Gray Century at the garden gate.

1525
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:59,300
There was a glimpse of a camouflage figure
running through the trees opposite no

1526
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:00,271
more than a hundred yards away,

1527
01:37:00,271 --> 01:37:04,350
diagonally across our front towards the
air landing troops. Then a couple more,

1528
01:37:04,470 --> 01:37:08,550
Jimmy's Bren fired again and one of the
figures pitched forward rolling over,

1529
01:37:08,730 --> 01:37:10,410
carried on by its own momentum.

1530
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:17,400
We would not, we would have to fight
and this is their, they're talking,

1531
01:37:17,401 --> 01:37:21,240
he's talking about the fact that
they're in the houses now in these,

1532
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:25,290
in this village, we would have
to fight from the house itself,

1533
01:37:25,291 --> 01:37:26,760
not from the trenches in the garden.

1534
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,150
It was a sturdy building with
thick solid walls. In any case,

1535
01:37:30,151 --> 01:37:33,630
the garden was too small for the
purpose from these upper windows.

1536
01:37:33,810 --> 01:37:38,730
We would have an extra range
and observation to fire
diagonally down the road in

1537
01:37:38,731 --> 01:37:43,590
front of the houses held by units to
the left and right. 15 minutes later,

1538
01:37:43,770 --> 01:37:46,110
the Trim Dutch house had been wrecked.

1539
01:37:46,830 --> 01:37:50,490
Every pane of glass had been smashed and
every picture and mirror knocked from

1540
01:37:50,491 --> 01:37:54,390
the walls. There was no time to be
careful in the center of each room.

1541
01:37:54,391 --> 01:37:58,320
Barricades been built well back from
the windows out of sight of the boat,

1542
01:37:58,410 --> 01:38:01,740
but cited so that every scrap
of ground outside was covered.

1543
01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:06,120
Sideboards and chest of drawers
stuffed with books or bedding made the

1544
01:38:06,121 --> 01:38:10,500
barricades contents of the furniture
flung in heaps into corners of the rooms.

1545
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:13,500
Mattresses were rolled
down to the basement,

1546
01:38:13,501 --> 01:38:15,810
ready for use if needed by wounded men.

1547
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:19,890
More books crammed into drawers were
blocking those windows not required for

1548
01:38:19,891 --> 01:38:22,200
shooting through.
Fortunately,

1549
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:26,670
the owner of the House possessed to find
library from its content seemed a lose.

1550
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:29,250
A doctor with gray.

1551
01:38:29,251 --> 01:38:33,150
I walked around the house for a final
check before leaving to return to my own

1552
01:38:33,151 --> 01:38:37,350
headquarters at the rear.
Manic vandals might've swept through it.

1553
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:42,000
Some woman's life work ruined in the
time it took to drink a cup of coffee.

1554
01:38:49,670 --> 01:38:53,720
An explosion from above followed by the
clatter of tiles falling from the roof,

1555
01:38:53,721 --> 01:38:55,340
drowned out the noise from the gun.

1556
01:38:55,490 --> 01:38:58,130
Another bomb burst in the
garden just outside the window,

1557
01:38:58,131 --> 01:39:00,500
sending a couple of fragments
whistling into the room.

1558
01:39:00,710 --> 01:39:03,140
Now the Bush were hitting
us with mortars as well.

1559
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:10,590
A bullet splintered of the empty frame
behind me and buried itself in the

1560
01:39:10,591 --> 01:39:15,060
ceiling. A warning that I was far
too close to the back bedroom window.

1561
01:39:15,570 --> 01:39:18,180
There was a sniper behind
us as well as the Spandau.

1562
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:22,500
A quick movement in the garden
of the house caught my eye.

1563
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:26,190
Then two figures in the wrong sort of
camouflage darted from behind a Bush and

1564
01:39:26,191 --> 01:39:29,250
did the shelter of a wall.
They were Boesch, not British,

1565
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:33,990
so now the enemy was indeed all around us.
There was no doubt about it.

1566
01:39:33,991 --> 01:39:38,991
Now John Simmons and his men were in
the houses where they had been left that

1567
01:39:39,210 --> 01:39:42,270
morning. John had made strong
points out of a couple of houses,

1568
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:45,420
smaller but just as robust
as the ones held by gray.

1569
01:39:46,530 --> 01:39:49,200
The two groups had been
working closely together.

1570
01:39:49,290 --> 01:39:53,430
Largely I felt certain because of John's
charm of manner and determination,

1571
01:39:54,150 --> 01:39:56,070
this young Gunnar had done very well.

1572
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:59,700
It hardly seems possible that most
of his men hardly knew him by sight.

1573
01:39:59,701 --> 01:40:02,370
Yesterday.
Today he is welded.

1574
01:40:02,371 --> 01:40:07,260
The survivors of four different companies
have a unit into have another arm into

1575
01:40:07,261 --> 01:40:09,300
a tight knit entity,

1576
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:13,320
well capable of carrying
on the fight all day.

1577
01:40:13,321 --> 01:40:17,490
They'd held from killing and wounding
quite a lot of enemy but losing only one

1578
01:40:17,491 --> 01:40:18,450
man themselves.

1579
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:22,620
A corporal have a company whose hand had
been blown in half by a flying mortar,

1580
01:40:22,621 --> 01:40:26,220
splinter
lined and filthy.

1581
01:40:26,221 --> 01:40:28,470
Though his face was eyes,

1582
01:40:28,471 --> 01:40:32,760
red rimmed and Chin stained
with three days worth of fare,

1583
01:40:32,761 --> 01:40:35,790
fuzzy down.
John still moved briskly.

1584
01:40:35,910 --> 01:40:40,020
Our reminder to all of us that
we could still keep going.

1585
01:40:41,670 --> 01:40:43,920
So he's got guys that
are stepping up big time.

1586
01:40:45,550 --> 01:40:45,760
Okay.

1587
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:49,090
Inside the houses we felt reasonably
safe from the shells and bullets,

1588
01:40:49,091 --> 01:40:52,450
but there was always some cause for the
officers and senior NCO is to move about

1589
01:40:52,451 --> 01:40:54,160
in the open from building to another.

1590
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:58,120
It was the same as it had been in the
woods, the officers and sergeants,

1591
01:40:58,121 --> 01:41:01,330
so this trade or greater chance of
being killed or wounded as their men,

1592
01:41:02,260 --> 01:41:05,950
all the same. It was easier for
an officer with so much to do.

1593
01:41:06,010 --> 01:41:09,490
He had little time to worry
about his own safety also.

1594
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:14,880
He always had to try and act the part
to set an example to the others and

1595
01:41:14,951 --> 01:41:18,310
officer had to exude confidence,
however hard it might be,

1596
01:41:19,210 --> 01:41:22,240
but because he always had to
try to keep a grip on himself,

1597
01:41:22,630 --> 01:41:24,460
it helped him forget the danger.

1598
01:41:28,350 --> 01:41:33,300
Very true. Very true. Got a
lot of things on your mind.

1599
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:41,560
They get a massive bombardment in
these positions that they're in.

1600
01:41:41,930 --> 01:41:45,260
Back to the book of the Germans must
be softening us up in preparation for

1601
01:41:45,261 --> 01:41:48,710
something more serious.
Their ammunition seemed unlimited.

1602
01:41:49,670 --> 01:41:52,940
The bombardment ended quite
suddenly rather as it had started.

1603
01:41:53,030 --> 01:41:57,830
This would be it nudging Williams to get
his head up from behind the barricade.

1604
01:41:57,980 --> 01:41:59,480
I shouted a warning to the others,

1605
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:03,440
Elkins and Bauer in the next room and
the two signalers who had moved up to the

1606
01:42:03,441 --> 01:42:07,690
bedroom at the back. The starter of
the Bren gun caught across the war,

1607
01:42:07,850 --> 01:42:10,670
the words Bauer's rifle fudded next door,

1608
01:42:10,790 --> 01:42:15,790
and then Williams was firing a succession
of bursts from his Bren gun in the

1609
01:42:16,041 --> 01:42:19,580
orchard opposite. Germans were
running through the trees towards us.

1610
01:42:19,670 --> 01:42:20,810
Several dropped.

1611
01:42:21,650 --> 01:42:25,730
This could only be the start of
an attack now from either flank,

1612
01:42:25,910 --> 01:42:29,630
the sound of rifles and machine guns
reached us accompanied by the thought of

1613
01:42:29,631 --> 01:42:33,860
exploding grenades. The attack
was coming in all along our front.

1614
01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:38,810
Some of the Germans among the fruit
trees were firing back a couple of rifle

1615
01:42:38,811 --> 01:42:43,100
bullets, splintered the front of the
wardrobe. Then more gray figures.

1616
01:42:43,101 --> 01:42:45,140
We're lumbering towards
us through the trees.

1617
01:42:45,290 --> 01:42:48,230
Some fell all there's ducked
behind the puny trees.

1618
01:42:49,250 --> 01:42:50,780
They didn't stand a chance.

1619
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:54,530
It was like shooting targets
on the press practice range.

1620
01:42:55,310 --> 01:42:59,300
The Germans and the mortars
had been forced to stop
because their troops were so

1621
01:42:59,301 --> 01:43:02,360
close. It was so, it was,

1622
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:04,640
it was possible to fire slow,

1623
01:43:04,850 --> 01:43:09,140
carefully aimed shots with
little or no distraction.

1624
01:43:10,190 --> 01:43:14,570
The only way out of the orchard was
through the single gap in the high fence,

1625
01:43:14,571 --> 01:43:17,750
but the enemy soldiers never
got within 20 yards of it.

1626
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:24,310
A Tall German officer was standing in
the middle of the drive out in the open,

1627
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:27,710
clear of the trees,
waving his arms to the men behind him.

1628
01:43:29,310 --> 01:43:31,110
No more than 50 yards away.

1629
01:43:31,230 --> 01:43:34,560
Every detail of his face and
uniform was clearly visible.

1630
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:39,660
He was a handsome young man, fair
haired, and smartly turned out

1631
01:43:41,310 --> 01:43:41,790
already.

1632
01:43:41,790 --> 01:43:46,170
He'd been standing there for about five
seconds encouraging his men to advance.

1633
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:49,950
As I leveled my sights
on the German officer,

1634
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:53,030
I knew that I was at someone
who is just about to die.

1635
01:43:54,830 --> 01:43:59,280
It seemed a pity. He was such a
courageous boy, just the sort,

1636
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:04,460
just the sort one would like to
have had as a platoon commander.

1637
01:44:05,910 --> 01:44:09,450
My fingers started to squeeze the trigger,
but it was too late.

1638
01:44:10,140 --> 01:44:13,140
Someone else had fired.
The German fell,

1639
01:44:13,170 --> 01:44:15,300
spread eagled and lay still.

1640
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:18,300
At least he died quickly.

1641
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,940
The death of the young officer
mark the end of the attack.

1642
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:25,833
Now,

1643
01:44:25,900 --> 01:44:30,820
no one moved in the orchard except for
a single wounded man squirming his way

1644
01:44:30,821 --> 01:44:32,110
back through the trees.

1645
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:37,940
So it's interesting when you,

1646
01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:42,740
you take the leader and the leader
goes down and the attacks over. Hmm.

1647
01:44:43,390 --> 01:44:44,600
Now,
uh,

1648
01:44:44,690 --> 01:44:49,390
also it's important to note that although
the leader stood up and encouraged the

1649
01:44:49,391 --> 01:44:53,770
attack by taking that risk of being out
there in front of everyone, in this case,

1650
01:44:53,771 --> 01:44:56,470
it didn't work out well
because he got shot,

1651
01:44:56,471 --> 01:44:58,960
killed and the attack faltered.

1652
01:45:00,130 --> 01:45:03,490
Perhaps if he could have found a little
bit better of a position to do that from

1653
01:45:03,910 --> 01:45:04,330
then,

1654
01:45:04,330 --> 01:45:07,900
then maybe then maybe he would have been
able to encourage his troops and stay

1655
01:45:07,901 --> 01:45:08,460
alive.

1656
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:09,293
Hmm.

1657
01:45:12,070 --> 01:45:12,903
Back to the book.

1658
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:18,000
But we had one no more than a temporary
respites 15 minutes later we could hear

1659
01:45:18,551 --> 01:45:23,050
the unnerving noise once again,
tracks were clattering towards us.

1660
01:45:24,730 --> 01:45:28,030
So I haven't, I don't know why
I haven't talked about this yet,

1661
01:45:28,031 --> 01:45:33,031
but here you have these airborne troops
on the ground and their biggest fear is

1662
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:35,680
tanks.

1663
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:40,680
And you've heard me talk many times
about my love for tanks and how effective

1664
01:45:42,401 --> 01:45:47,401
and awesome they are as tools and as
a weapons and the way that the tankers

1665
01:45:49,241 --> 01:45:51,790
utilize them. They're just,
they're just awesome machines.

1666
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:58,740
But here you have the tables turned
and and the good guys don't have real,

1667
01:46:00,550 --> 01:46:03,070
any effective way of stopping these tanks.

1668
01:46:03,310 --> 01:46:06,280
You can shoot a machine
gun all day long at a,

1669
01:46:06,281 --> 01:46:10,090
at a panzer tank and it's
not going to do a damn thing.

1670
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:14,770
And so it can just, and by the way,
you hide in the building, cool a tank.

1671
01:46:14,771 --> 01:46:17,950
We'll go right through a building.
They go right through buildings.

1672
01:46:18,370 --> 01:46:22,510
They will go right through a building
like it looks like a construction piece of

1673
01:46:22,511 --> 01:46:24,040
heavy equipment.
That's what it looks like.

1674
01:46:24,041 --> 01:46:25,810
It'll go right through a
building like it's nothing.

1675
01:46:26,260 --> 01:46:30,790
So these guys are absolutely
horrified of the tank showing up.

1676
01:46:30,940 --> 01:46:31,870
That's their fear.

1677
01:46:35,020 --> 01:46:37,570
Tram tracks were clattering toward us,

1678
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:42,750
a gun funded and the dark
red house opposite began to
fall apart as round after

1679
01:46:43,301 --> 01:46:44,560
round crashed into it.

1680
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:48,780
Muzzle flashes from the far side of the
orchard revealed the position of the,

1681
01:46:49,470 --> 01:46:53,100
but there was nothing we could do.
At least the men.

1682
01:46:53,101 --> 01:46:57,270
We're not waiting in the house but
slipping one after another out the door,

1683
01:46:57,390 --> 01:47:02,390
back across the road to the
headquarter house on either side.

1684
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:06,780
The guns were firing.
Now it was our turn,

1685
01:47:10,460 --> 01:47:12,340
the the

1686
01:47:12,430 --> 01:47:17,320
tank rex, some of the houses
and then it the tank leaves.

1687
01:47:18,730 --> 01:47:21,010
So here we go. It's, it
was time to strike back.

1688
01:47:21,190 --> 01:47:25,390
The tanks had gone and as yet the Bose
did not appear to have occupied the

1689
01:47:25,391 --> 01:47:29,860
houses lying out there in the rear
gardens overlooked from the windows.

1690
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:34,270
We were vulnerable indeed.
Soon the mortaring would start again,

1691
01:47:34,450 --> 01:47:36,640
then we'd be safe for back
in the ruined buildings.

1692
01:47:38,050 --> 01:47:41,410
As John Simmons listened
to the instructions,

1693
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:44,170
the young captains manor
was as relaxed as ever,

1694
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:47,140
calm and outwardly self confident.

1695
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:50,800
He somehow managed to give the impression
that he was almost enjoying the

1696
01:47:50,801 --> 01:47:51,640
morning's work.

1697
01:47:52,090 --> 01:47:56,740
Possibly he was making
that a point subconsciously
perhaps that are gunner could

1698
01:47:56,741 --> 01:47:58,990
always take charge of 30 infantry men,

1699
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:04,750
but there were undoubtedly immense rose
reserves of strength hidden behind that

1700
01:48:04,751 --> 01:48:06,490
cool exterior.

1701
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:11,710
As he lay behind the bed of half dead
pea plants scanning the houses for any

1702
01:48:11,711 --> 01:48:12,940
sign of German occupants.

1703
01:48:13,180 --> 01:48:17,050
There was no trace of disquiet and his
voice as he discussed his orders to

1704
01:48:17,051 --> 01:48:19,420
counter attack and clear
the street to the enemy.

1705
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:23,450
15 minutes after John had gone,

1706
01:48:23,660 --> 01:48:27,140
I was still in the same
place in the vegetable patch
watching the second hand on

1707
01:48:27,141 --> 01:48:29,210
my watch creep towards
the top of the dial.

1708
01:48:30,770 --> 01:48:32,870
Then graze weapon opened up on the right,

1709
01:48:32,871 --> 01:48:36,440
firing back in the back into
the rooms of the houses,

1710
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:39,890
more in the hope of distracting the enemy.
Then providing covering fire.

1711
01:48:41,330 --> 01:48:45,800
The danger to John's men lay on the
other side, the front of the houses.

1712
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:51,020
Now John's three brand guns
were firing as well on the left.

1713
01:48:52,190 --> 01:48:55,070
The assault party would soon
be moving into the street.

1714
01:48:57,150 --> 01:48:57,983
It came

1715
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:03,790
the sustained rattle of a Spandau Gun,
first one,

1716
01:49:04,110 --> 01:49:05,020
then a second.

1717
01:49:05,770 --> 01:49:06,300
Okay.

1718
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:10,830
After that there was silence
except for one or two rifle shots.

1719
01:49:12,570 --> 01:49:15,720
I waited lying in the vegetable patch,

1720
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:20,430
almost a straw with worry.
Something was badly wrong.

1721
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:22,200
Nothing could be seen from here,

1722
01:49:22,290 --> 01:49:25,650
but I had to resist the temptation of
going to find out for myself what had

1723
01:49:25,651 --> 01:49:29,100
happened. I must avoid getting
involved in the skirmish.

1724
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:32,190
Then Corporal Day,

1725
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:35,970
now John's second in command was running
through the flower beds toward me.

1726
01:49:37,510 --> 01:49:41,490
Days. Face said everything even
before he started to speak.

1727
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:42,990
Okay?

1728
01:49:42,990 --> 01:49:44,100
The attack had failed.

1729
01:49:45,060 --> 01:49:48,850
It had failed the moment John had been
killed out there in the middle of the

1730
01:49:48,851 --> 01:49:52,750
street and 10 yards in front of day
and the rest of the assault party,

1731
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:57,460
John had died in just the same way as
that young German officer this morning

1732
01:49:59,870 --> 01:50:03,380
that had finished it.
The rest of them,

1733
01:50:03,590 --> 01:50:08,390
including day had turned and run,
but in some extraordinary way.

1734
01:50:08,690 --> 01:50:13,650
No one else had been hit
day made no excuse,

1735
01:50:14,130 --> 01:50:15,930
no attempt to excuse himself,

1736
01:50:16,230 --> 01:50:19,830
telling the story factually and not
trying to put a gloss on the incident.

1737
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:25,410
The implication was clear.
They had been asked to do too much.

1738
01:50:29,190 --> 01:50:32,580
So now I had been responsible
for killing John as well.

1739
01:50:33,740 --> 01:50:34,400
Okay.

1740
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:35,630
It had been so simple.

1741
01:50:35,990 --> 01:50:40,010
I issued the orders and then John had
walked out into the middle of that road to

1742
01:50:40,011 --> 01:50:41,810
be shot down by the machine gun.

1743
01:50:45,060 --> 01:50:46,320
I should not have done it right.

1744
01:50:48,330 --> 01:50:50,550
The counter attack should
never have been attempted.

1745
01:50:51,870 --> 01:50:54,810
The men were no longer capable
of making such an effort.

1746
01:50:56,430 --> 01:50:59,940
They could still hang onto their
positions fighting from behind cover,

1747
01:50:59,941 --> 01:51:02,100
but after six days of continuous battle,

1748
01:51:02,250 --> 01:51:05,280
they lack the will to get to
their feet and go for the enemy

1749
01:51:07,330 --> 01:51:08,200
in the woods.

1750
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:12,640
It had just been possible to urge them
forward in one last surge of willpower,

1751
01:51:12,820 --> 01:51:17,820
but since then they didn't dirt
or a further 48 hours of death,

1752
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:23,070
starvation, thirst, and
fatigue, and in the woods,

1753
01:51:23,071 --> 01:51:27,510
it was men from my own company.
Today, it had been different. Today,

1754
01:51:27,511 --> 01:51:28,440
a mixture of men,

1755
01:51:28,590 --> 01:51:33,000
survivors of four different companies
had been left to follow a gunner officer

1756
01:51:33,060 --> 01:51:34,200
whom they hardly knew.

1757
01:51:36,610 --> 01:51:40,960
There was a limit to what soldiers could
be asked to do and I had gone beyond

1758
01:51:40,961 --> 01:51:41,794
those limits

1759
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:47,760
and so John Simmons had died.

1760
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:58,460
Okay.
Okay.

1761
01:52:03,740 --> 01:52:05,090
That's the burden of command.

1762
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:10,153
Yeah.

1763
01:52:10,590 --> 01:52:11,490
Back to the book,

1764
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:16,200
it was impossible to understand why the
Germans were not using their arm or to

1765
01:52:16,201 --> 01:52:20,220
support this infiltration by their
infantry if they had done so,

1766
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:25,140
all resistance would have collapsed long
ago and the tanks would have been on

1767
01:52:25,141 --> 01:52:25,974
the lawns.

1768
01:52:26,790 --> 01:52:27,360
Yeah.

1769
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:29,970
The crushing news at the
brigadier had been badly wounded,

1770
01:52:29,971 --> 01:52:33,480
came through on the telephone just
before the line went dead. Once again,

1771
01:52:34,890 --> 01:52:37,380
the Boesch,
we're now among the houses and gardens,

1772
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:41,550
which the glider pilots had been holding
and gray had reported that he was being

1773
01:52:41,551 --> 01:52:43,950
shot at from two sides at the same time.

1774
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:51,220
The quarter master had also sent word
that the enemy were behind him and that he

1775
01:52:52,031 --> 01:52:55,750
had long ago lost all contact
with the recky on his left.

1776
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:04,113
Okay.

1777
01:53:04,470 --> 01:53:09,470
They are just in a wretched state and he
goes to meet with the colonel in one of

1778
01:53:10,951 --> 01:53:14,700
the buildings. The colonel seemed
to be trying to break something to,

1779
01:53:14,850 --> 01:53:19,770
to us gently and then it came out.
It was hard to believe,

1780
01:53:19,890 --> 01:53:24,890
harder still to understand the division
was to be withdrawn over the Rhine that

1781
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:31,160
night. It was all over. It had been,

1782
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:35,540
it had only been possible to ferry about
250 men of the door sits over the river

1783
01:53:35,541 --> 01:53:39,080
before dawn, a profit lists
addition to the perimeter garrison,

1784
01:53:40,410 --> 01:53:44,250
the second army had overreached itself
and trying to get to us and although the

1785
01:53:44,251 --> 01:53:46,050
troops were pouring northward,

1786
01:53:46,260 --> 01:53:50,100
they lack the strength across the river
and continued the advance into Germany

1787
01:53:51,810 --> 01:53:52,770
already the bush,

1788
01:53:52,771 --> 01:53:56,340
we're hammering from the flanks at
their narrow lines of communication,

1789
01:53:58,860 --> 01:54:01,260
so the operation had failed.

1790
01:54:03,430 --> 01:54:07,730
Everything had been in vain.
It was all a waste.

1791
01:54:10,110 --> 01:54:12,600
Listening to the outline of
what had to be done that night,

1792
01:54:12,601 --> 01:54:14,580
it was hard to concentrate on the details.

1793
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:16,190
Okay.

1794
01:54:16,190 --> 01:54:17,990
The first emotion was grief

1795
01:54:19,530 --> 01:54:21,340
and then other disappointment.

1796
01:54:23,880 --> 01:54:27,570
The battalion had been
destroyed to no purpose

1797
01:54:34,180 --> 01:54:35,013
and that's it.

1798
01:54:35,020 --> 01:54:40,020
They get the order that night to
leave and they come up with a plan.

1799
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,340
They actually follow rope.

1800
01:54:45,490 --> 01:54:48,640
They put rope at night down towards
the river where they're going to get

1801
01:54:48,641 --> 01:54:53,380
extracted and at night they attempt
to follow that rope down there.

1802
01:54:53,381 --> 01:54:57,220
And of course along the way they
lose more men. Men Get separated,

1803
01:54:57,460 --> 01:54:58,600
men don't hang on,

1804
01:54:58,601 --> 01:55:02,230
they get lost and they lose even more
men as they're trying to make it to their

1805
01:55:02,231 --> 01:55:03,430
extraction point.

1806
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:08,440
But he does get end up with a small
group of people at this extraction point.

1807
01:55:08,441 --> 01:55:12,040
There's Canadian boats there to
bring them across the Rhine River.

1808
01:55:13,810 --> 01:55:14,411
Back to the book,

1809
01:55:14,411 --> 01:55:18,580
the Canadians were already pulling the
last men into the boat and I was standing

1810
01:55:18,581 --> 01:55:23,260
with Harrison alone in the river when
I heard the whiners voice harshly

1811
01:55:23,261 --> 01:55:25,450
insisting that no one would be left behind

1812
01:55:27,310 --> 01:55:30,670
the young Cox and needed no further urging
button poured us to be careful as the

1813
01:55:30,671 --> 01:55:32,380
boat was grossly overloaded.

1814
01:55:33,370 --> 01:55:33,680
Okay.

1815
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:37,790
Then Harrison pushed me up over the side
and the two of us flopped down behind

1816
01:55:37,791 --> 01:55:42,680
the and as the engine went into gear and
the boat move towards the mid stream.

1817
01:55:45,210 --> 01:55:48,240
So now they get across the
river, they get dropped off. And,

1818
01:55:48,250 --> 01:55:50,430
and to answer your question earlier,

1819
01:55:50,550 --> 01:55:53,040
once they get dropped off and
they're on the other side of the,

1820
01:55:53,130 --> 01:55:57,180
they're on the western side of the
Rhine River. It's basically secure area.

1821
01:55:57,990 --> 01:56:01,500
Even though it was only, you
know, several hundred yards away,

1822
01:56:01,770 --> 01:56:06,770
it was relatively secure and now what
they have to do is they have to march back

1823
01:56:07,411 --> 01:56:11,400
about five miles to get to
a even more secure base.

1824
01:56:12,810 --> 01:56:15,120
Here we go back to the book
as we reached the track,

1825
01:56:15,330 --> 01:56:19,350
which after a few hundred yards
let us to the road when I stopped,

1826
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:22,260
the men flopped to the ground,
empty and lifeless,

1827
01:56:22,530 --> 01:56:27,530
lacking any wish to go on more parties
of men appeared for the darkness

1828
01:56:28,110 --> 01:56:31,830
shambling in the exhaustion of relief,
all terror ended,

1829
01:56:31,980 --> 01:56:35,040
devoid of the willpower needed
to summon up further effort.

1830
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:40,740
There was only one way to make the two
mile march bearable and old fashioned

1831
01:56:40,741 --> 01:56:44,820
remedy.
I called the Sergeant Weiner to fall.

1832
01:56:44,821 --> 01:56:46,320
The men in threes,

1833
01:56:47,490 --> 01:56:51,360
the discipline bark bounced back to me
as wiener pulled himself to his feet,

1834
01:56:51,361 --> 01:56:52,740
shouting to the men to fall in.

1835
01:56:53,820 --> 01:56:58,170
There was no trace of query or surprise
in whiners voice and the men shuffled to

1836
01:56:58,171 --> 01:57:01,700
their feet.
That's,

1837
01:57:02,360 --> 01:57:04,100
that's your route training right there,

1838
01:57:04,310 --> 01:57:09,290
that you're exhausted after eight days
of continuous combat, you're just done.

1839
01:57:09,770 --> 01:57:11,720
And the sergeant says,
all right,

1840
01:57:11,810 --> 01:57:14,690
on your feet form a column
of threes and you do it.

1841
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:21,170
They're getting close to the end.
I'm now,

1842
01:57:21,171 --> 01:57:24,530
they can see the camp and I hosted them.

1843
01:57:24,980 --> 01:57:28,340
There was only one way to end such
a march. It was pointless perhaps.

1844
01:57:28,341 --> 01:57:32,630
But I decided to make the final gesture,
bringing them to attention.

1845
01:57:32,810 --> 01:57:37,160
I ordered them to slope, arms and
demarche by the left to attention.

1846
01:57:38,390 --> 01:57:41,750
I sensed their appreciation as
there's shoulders went back.

1847
01:57:42,830 --> 01:57:44,870
This was the way they
always returned to camp.

1848
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:50,300
This was the way they always finished.
As they stepped off for the last 50 yards,

1849
01:57:50,660 --> 01:57:52,550
they were even swinging their arms.

1850
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:57,900
So they march back into this camp.
Once they get into this camp,

1851
01:57:57,901 --> 01:58:00,870
they get loaded up into uh,
a vehicle,

1852
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:05,070
a big military transport vehicle that's
going to take them further to the rear

1853
01:58:05,071 --> 01:58:08,630
where they can get some treatment
and they're loaded into that for you.

1854
01:58:08,730 --> 01:58:09,563
Cool

1855
01:58:12,490 --> 01:58:15,850
and here we go. Back to the book, the
canopy of the truck now sheltered us,

1856
01:58:16,180 --> 01:58:18,340
but my shivering became uncontrollable.

1857
01:58:19,510 --> 01:58:23,680
I knew I was becoming light headed and
could hear myself grieving allowed for

1858
01:58:23,681 --> 01:58:25,270
those that we had left behind,

1859
01:58:25,420 --> 01:58:29,020
particularly for those who had been lost
during the withdrawal down the river

1860
01:58:29,021 --> 01:58:32,770
bank.
There was silence in the truck.

1861
01:58:34,150 --> 01:58:39,150
Then I heard as if from a long way off
the voice of Sergeant Weiner clon calm

1862
01:58:39,881 --> 01:58:44,881
and flat saying that none of them would've
got back if it had not been for me.

1863
01:58:46,740 --> 01:58:51,330
It was true to say that I would never
have got back if it hadn't been for them,

1864
01:58:51,480 --> 01:58:55,770
but I shall always be grateful
to Weiner for having said it.

1865
01:58:58,170 --> 01:59:03,170
The next thing I remember was Weiner
and Harrison half carrying me into what

1866
01:59:03,421 --> 01:59:04,560
seemed to be a hospital.

1867
01:59:04,950 --> 01:59:05,783
Yeah,

1868
01:59:06,160 --> 01:59:09,850
someone was stripping off my
clothes and dressing me in pajamas.

1869
01:59:11,470 --> 01:59:13,660
Then I felt the prick
of a needle in my arm.

1870
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:18,513
I was awake.

1871
01:59:20,440 --> 01:59:23,740
The Sun shining into the
windows of the award,

1872
01:59:24,980 --> 01:59:29,330
an orderly brought tea and food on a tray.
I laid between the clean sheets,

1873
01:59:29,450 --> 01:59:33,080
looking at the torn and filthy garments
on the chair by the side of the bed.

1874
01:59:35,030 --> 01:59:36,530
There was nothing wrong with me.
Now

1875
01:59:38,120 --> 01:59:40,700
I saw that my hand was
wrapped in a clean bandage.

1876
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:45,030
When the nursing orderly
came to remove the tray.

1877
01:59:45,270 --> 01:59:48,990
He brought me the message that a soldier
was waiting in the corridor to see me.

1878
01:59:50,700 --> 01:59:52,860
As soon as the orderly left the room,

1879
01:59:52,861 --> 01:59:55,920
I slipped out of bed and put on my
clothes and went out into the corridor

1880
01:59:57,850 --> 01:59:59,290
waiting.
There was Harrison,

1881
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:04,120
a broad smile on his face telling me that
captain gray and Mr Elkins and turned

1882
02:00:04,121 --> 02:00:05,380
up with eight of the missing men.

1883
02:00:06,820 --> 02:00:10,450
Another 20 stragglers had also
arrived from somewhere or another,

1884
02:00:12,370 --> 02:00:16,270
but that was the lot.
That was the battalion

1885
02:00:17,820 --> 02:00:21,060
three officers and 43 soldiers.

1886
02:00:25,030 --> 02:00:28,360
We walked out the door
of the hospital side

1887
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:31,620
side by side,

1888
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:37,090
the week September sun shone
down on the battered buildings.

1889
02:00:39,020 --> 02:00:40,370
I'll way in the distance,

1890
02:00:41,290 --> 02:00:45,620
the dull rumble of the battle
still rolled down from the north

1891
02:00:55,970 --> 02:00:59,870
and
once

1892
02:01:02,620 --> 02:01:05,290
all the men were recovered, and
that's, that's the end of the book.

1893
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:09,580
And when all the men were recovered it,

1894
02:01:09,581 --> 02:01:13,720
and when you look at the actual battalion
of 156 the parish parachute battalion,

1895
02:01:13,721 --> 02:01:17,680
it looked like this. 313 men were
captured. Many of those were wounded.

1896
02:01:18,220 --> 02:01:23,220
There was 98 killed in action and there
was a total of 68 from the battalion

1897
02:01:24,131 --> 02:01:25,870
that made it across the Rhine safely

1898
02:01:28,100 --> 02:01:31,160
and those 68 men,
if they could heal up,

1899
02:01:31,161 --> 02:01:36,161
were then sent to the
other battalions inside.

1900
02:01:36,321 --> 02:01:41,321
The first pair of Rubber Dade and the
hundred and 56th parachute battalion was

1901
02:01:43,941 --> 02:01:48,320
actually disbanded.
It ceased to exist.

1902
02:01:51,430 --> 02:01:56,430
Jeffry Powell went on
to retire from the army,

1903
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:01,800
the British army in 1964 he
retired as a major general.

1904
02:02:02,750 --> 02:02:04,640
He was awarded the military cross,

1905
02:02:04,641 --> 02:02:07,550
which is Britain's third
highest award for valor

1906
02:02:10,420 --> 02:02:15,420
and this is what his citation reads at
Arnhem numb after his commanding officer

1907
02:02:16,661 --> 02:02:17,620
had become a casualty,

1908
02:02:17,621 --> 02:02:21,790
Major Powell took command of the remnants
of the battalion up to this time.

1909
02:02:21,791 --> 02:02:26,230
He conducted himself with the greatest
gallantry for the remaining six days.

1910
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:31,320
He retained control of his unit and also
of the men of other units in the area

1911
02:02:31,631 --> 02:02:33,550
under the most difficult conditions.

1912
02:02:35,440 --> 02:02:39,580
Heavy fire for mortars, artillery and
self propelled guns never stopped,

1913
02:02:39,581 --> 02:02:40,720
is it activity?

1914
02:02:40,840 --> 02:02:45,070
And getting round his section of the
perimeter and encouraging his men to

1915
02:02:45,071 --> 02:02:46,090
greater efforts

1916
02:02:48,030 --> 02:02:52,440
throughout the whole period of the and
m battle. In spite of being wounded,

1917
02:02:53,070 --> 02:02:57,420
this officer showed himself to be a
gallant leader of men and the most capable

1918
02:02:57,421 --> 02:03:01,860
fighter and one whose bravery was a
source of inspiration to the men under his

1919
02:03:01,861 --> 02:03:04,440
command and to all those around him.

1920
02:03:13,700 --> 02:03:18,020
And I think it's pretty clear that
if you will read a book like this,

1921
02:03:20,790 --> 02:03:25,790
General Powell is still a source of
inspiration as are the rest of these

1922
02:03:27,540 --> 02:03:29,430
incredibly brave men.

1923
02:03:30,990 --> 02:03:31,560
Okay.

1924
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:34,920
And also a source of leadership lessons

1925
02:03:37,320 --> 02:03:41,490
of what to do and what not to do.

1926
02:03:41,491 --> 02:03:46,491
And it's also an incredible reminder
of that heavy burden of command.

1927
02:03:53,030 --> 02:03:55,220
And the fact of the matter is,
when you lead,

1928
02:03:56,060 --> 02:03:59,660
you own every decision and every action,

1929
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:03,650
not only of yourself,
but of your men.

1930
02:04:08,300 --> 02:04:12,530
And with that burden,
you owe it to them.

1931
02:04:14,470 --> 02:04:15,303
Yeah.

1932
02:04:15,450 --> 02:04:20,450
To be as well prepared to be as tactically
sound and to be as physically and

1933
02:04:21,481 --> 02:04:24,930
mentally strong as you can possibly be.

1934
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:33,430
And that goes for any leadership
position when you're a leader,

1935
02:04:33,550 --> 02:04:37,060
be as prepared as you possibly can.

1936
02:04:40,620 --> 02:04:45,620
And then you go out and you lead and
you lead with courage and you lead with

1937
02:04:45,751 --> 02:04:48,720
resolution and you lead with boldness,

1938
02:04:54,300 --> 02:04:57,390
boldness like Jeffrey Pal,

1939
02:04:59,350 --> 02:05:02,130
then the officers and the
men of the hundred and 50,

1940
02:05:02,131 --> 02:05:04,680
sixth parachute battalion.

1941
02:05:10,670 --> 02:05:15,640
Pretty amazing book that,
you know,

1942
02:05:15,641 --> 02:05:19,420
like I said,
I got this book six days ago or something,

1943
02:05:19,630 --> 02:05:23,430
somebody just sent it to
me and I gave it the um,

1944
02:05:24,190 --> 02:05:27,310
the little tests when I kind of opened
books up cause people send me a lot of

1945
02:05:27,311 --> 02:05:31,720
books and I gave it the, uh, I gave
it the test. You know, I opened up,

1946
02:05:31,721 --> 02:05:35,350
I read a couple sections and it
immediately, you know, I'll give, I'll,

1947
02:05:35,530 --> 02:05:39,520
I'll open to a book and four
or five different places
to see what it reads like.

1948
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:45,880
And this, you know, within the first page,
the first page that I read, I said, oh,

1949
02:05:46,060 --> 02:05:48,130
we,
it looks like we have a winner here.

1950
02:05:48,190 --> 02:05:52,600
This one's going to be on the
podcast because it's just impactful.

1951
02:05:53,050 --> 02:05:56,800
And the account. Now, the,

1952
02:05:57,430 --> 02:06:02,360
in the back of the book,
he talks about the,

1953
02:06:02,420 --> 02:06:07,120
the individuals, just read some of
them off here. The brigadier was

1954
02:06:09,110 --> 02:06:12,080
General John Hackett.

1955
02:06:12,830 --> 02:06:17,690
The colonel was Dickie Divo
of the Grenadier guards.

1956
02:06:19,130 --> 02:06:23,930
His fellow granted year was sergeant
major, sergeant major dentist,

1957
02:06:23,931 --> 02:06:27,860
Gay, his Batman, the
guy that he talks about,

1958
02:06:27,861 --> 02:06:31,130
Harrison throughout the book,
the guy that's there from
the beginning to the end,

1959
02:06:31,131 --> 02:06:33,610
always by his side.
That was actually a guy named Fred Tracy,

1960
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:38,510
a guy named David [inaudible] went in
the book is the character in the book.

1961
02:06:38,511 --> 02:06:40,550
The real guy was named Michael Page,

1962
02:06:41,870 --> 02:06:46,870
who had been Powells best man and
whose son Jeffery born posthumously had

1963
02:06:48,981 --> 02:06:51,350
another son named Michael

1964
02:06:54,590 --> 02:06:58,400
and Luke Tyler and Sergeant
Wiener and Jones and Johnson,

1965
02:06:58,401 --> 02:07:03,320
as these were all real
people. So, you know,

1966
02:07:03,330 --> 02:07:04,600
this is another guy that uh,

1967
02:07:04,650 --> 02:07:09,470
very similar to major John Glover who
said he had a hard time writing about

1968
02:07:09,471 --> 02:07:12,650
himself in the first person. You
know, I did this and I did that,

1969
02:07:12,651 --> 02:07:14,310
but it's the same thing that Powell said.
You know,

1970
02:07:14,330 --> 02:07:17,240
he had a hard time writing until
he just made it about some other,

1971
02:07:17,390 --> 02:07:21,650
he made some other character in his
hand and vote from that perspective.

1972
02:07:22,370 --> 02:07:27,180
But man, you definitely, this book I,

1973
02:07:27,260 --> 02:07:30,800
like I said, I read, I
don't know, 5% of it.

1974
02:07:31,340 --> 02:07:33,230
It's not a huge book though actually.

1975
02:07:33,410 --> 02:07:36,670
It's only a couple of hundred pages
long and it's a very fast read.

1976
02:07:37,630 --> 02:07:42,580
Did you find it to give you this weird
stressful feeling reading now? Absolutely.

1977
02:07:42,581 --> 02:07:46,660
Like listening to, it's like just
more stress, stress. It is. And I was,

1978
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:51,720
I was debating when to tell you
and when to tell everyone that,

1979
02:07:52,260 --> 02:07:54,970
that this is not a good, that
this isn't a good story, right.

1980
02:07:54,970 --> 02:07:56,260
That this isn't a positive thing.

1981
02:07:57,100 --> 02:08:01,840
And I kinda just, I don't know.
When I actually said that, hey,

1982
02:08:01,841 --> 02:08:05,440
they're not going to win. I mean, I said
that the, the operation market garden was,

1983
02:08:05,441 --> 02:08:08,440
it was a failure, but you know,
what does that really look like?

1984
02:08:08,470 --> 02:08:09,190
You know what I mean?

1985
02:08:09,190 --> 02:08:12,130
Like you don't know what that looks
like until you get reading this book and

1986
02:08:12,131 --> 02:08:14,020
then you start to feel what
it feels like an absolutely.

1987
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:19,510
And when you read the whole book,
man, it is just coming apart.

1988
02:08:19,540 --> 02:08:21,880
It's just little misfortune,
little miss four.

1989
02:08:21,881 --> 02:08:25,450
And they're just coming in and they
don't stop. They just don't stop.

1990
02:08:26,170 --> 02:08:30,670
It's a,
it's a nightmare scenario and yeah,

1991
02:08:30,671 --> 02:08:32,600
and there's tons of great lessons learned.
It's so,

1992
02:08:32,630 --> 02:08:35,510
it's so amazing because I never read
this book before. I just got it. Yeah.

1993
02:08:35,770 --> 02:08:39,760
But it's amazing. Cover move.
Yeah. Decentralized Command.

1994
02:08:40,150 --> 02:08:44,950
Even prioritize and execute.
Even the apart when you're
keeping it simple, right?

1995
02:08:44,980 --> 02:08:48,480
Everything that, that we
learned that, you know,

1996
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:50,230
I should've learned this years ago

1997
02:08:52,780 --> 02:08:57,280
and when I think about, you
know, I was, you, you, you
look back at your life, right?

1998
02:08:57,400 --> 02:09:00,010
And you say to yourself, what could I have
done better? What could I do different?

1999
02:09:00,430 --> 02:09:02,200
And you know,
everyone in the seal teams,

2000
02:09:02,500 --> 02:09:07,030
like basically you get one shot at
each job other than just being uh, uh,

2001
02:09:07,660 --> 02:09:11,170
a shooter and a platoon that you can
do three or four times if you're lucky.

2002
02:09:12,670 --> 02:09:15,670
But then once you get into a
leadership position, you're like,

2003
02:09:15,700 --> 02:09:18,070
you're an assistant platoon commander,
you do that one time,

2004
02:09:18,460 --> 02:09:20,740
then you're a platoon commander,
you do that one time,

2005
02:09:20,860 --> 02:09:23,920
then you're a task unit commander. You
do that one time. Generally some guys,

2006
02:09:23,950 --> 02:09:28,390
sometimes the guys rarely guys do more
than one of those same thing on the

2007
02:09:28,391 --> 02:09:30,850
enlisted side.
Guy Gets to do an uh,

2008
02:09:30,860 --> 02:09:34,630
a leading petty officer does that one
time chief petty officer of a platoon,

2009
02:09:34,780 --> 02:09:36,400
platoon chief does that one time.

2010
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:40,420
Senior chief in charge of a
task unit does that one time.

2011
02:09:40,720 --> 02:09:42,250
You don't get to repeat the jobs.

2012
02:09:42,370 --> 02:09:45,340
And so basically when you're
finally getting good at your job,

2013
02:09:45,880 --> 02:09:49,120
you're done and now you've got to go get
the next job up the chain of command.

2014
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:54,510
So for me it was always, and now looking
back and, and, and even talking to,

2015
02:09:54,670 --> 02:09:56,340
talking to my seal buddies now,
like,

2016
02:09:56,650 --> 02:10:01,650
like how can we prepare them better so
they know what we had to learn during the

2017
02:10:02,861 --> 02:10:04,030
job. It's, it's,

2018
02:10:04,031 --> 02:10:06,850
it's a hard thing to do because it's
because a lot of stuff that you actually

2019
02:10:06,851 --> 02:10:07,990
have to learn from experience.

2020
02:10:08,950 --> 02:10:12,700
And actually we talked about that
at the last muster, which is,

2021
02:10:13,030 --> 02:10:15,190
that was a big part that we talked about.
Your,

2022
02:10:15,220 --> 02:10:17,440
if you're going to get good at something,
you have two choices,

2023
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:21,730
experience or training and
training as a way to condense,

2024
02:10:21,731 --> 02:10:25,580
experience down and distill it.
And that's what was great about when we,

2025
02:10:25,620 --> 02:10:28,530
when I was running training
on the west coast, we,

2026
02:10:28,550 --> 02:10:32,800
we got to really condensed that
experiential, I mean guys went through,

2027
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:34,610
guys went through hellacious

2028
02:10:34,610 --> 02:10:37,100
training and we're,

2029
02:10:37,160 --> 02:10:41,030
we'd provide total chaos for them that
most guys wouldn't experience that kind

2030
02:10:41,031 --> 02:10:43,790
of chaos in their whole
career or in 10 careers.

2031
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:47,150
But they would get it and they
would get pushed super hard.

2032
02:10:47,151 --> 02:10:49,580
So that way when they got out on the
battlefield they were ready for the,

2033
02:10:49,790 --> 02:10:51,050
for the chaos that was out there.

2034
02:10:51,080 --> 02:10:55,550
Cause we trained him and we pushed him
further and harder during training than

2035
02:10:55,551 --> 02:10:59,960
we hoped they would get pestered pushed
on the battlefield. Yeah. It was crazy.

2036
02:10:59,961 --> 02:11:01,160
Even though that covering move,

2037
02:11:01,161 --> 02:11:05,060
even when they're retreating it's like
it showed like how you got to keep that,

2038
02:11:05,350 --> 02:11:07,880
that discipline, that
discipline. It's kind of like,

2039
02:11:07,970 --> 02:11:12,230
you know like in an MMA fight or something
and the guy who starts getting hit on

2040
02:11:12,231 --> 02:11:17,150
the insight and rather than still covering
up a little bit while he goes back,

2041
02:11:17,151 --> 02:11:19,580
he like runs away or turns his
back or something like that.

2042
02:11:20,270 --> 02:11:24,860
You don't turn your back and you're done.
But great book.

2043
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:29,940
I definitely recommend it for your
reading list. Yeah, there was a,

2044
02:11:29,970 --> 02:11:34,550
there was that part in there that the
guy came up to I think reload ammo or

2045
02:11:34,551 --> 02:11:39,551
something and the guy's sitting there
and he's just so he gets like scolded or

2046
02:11:39,741 --> 02:11:44,180
whatever and you know, it turns out these
wounded. Right. Like that's kind of,

2047
02:11:44,420 --> 02:11:47,630
that was an interesting little lesson
there. Like, you just don't know.

2048
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:50,670
You can't just start going off
on. It's totally true. And,

2049
02:11:50,671 --> 02:11:54,410
and I don't know if you remember, somebody
asks us a question one time about,

2050
02:11:55,450 --> 02:11:58,980
you know, how do I, these people that
have had everything given to them and I,

2051
02:11:59,110 --> 02:12:02,660
and I, you know, I've had, I grew up in
a tough neighborhood and it's like, oh,

2052
02:12:02,661 --> 02:12:04,760
you didn't, you actually don't know
what that person's been through.

2053
02:12:04,920 --> 02:12:07,670
And we had that whole discussion.
That's the same thing.

2054
02:12:07,671 --> 02:12:11,090
True on a day to day basis
with every other human being
that you're dealing with.

2055
02:12:11,120 --> 02:12:12,470
You don't know what they're going through.

2056
02:12:12,471 --> 02:12:15,740
You don't know what triumphs and
tragedies they've had in their life.

2057
02:12:15,741 --> 02:12:17,720
You don't know what just
happened to them this morning.

2058
02:12:17,990 --> 02:12:22,820
So the recommended course of action as
you give someone a little bit of slack

2059
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:24,470
when you don't know him,
you know,

2060
02:12:25,190 --> 02:12:29,470
you ever seen that at Seinfeld when he
either goes to talk to that girl, come on.

2061
02:12:29,810 --> 02:12:33,470
It was actually, it was, it was pretty
much this, but just on Seinfeld.

2062
02:12:33,710 --> 02:12:36,170
So he goes to talk to this guy. He's
like, oh, I got to talk to that girl.

2063
02:12:36,171 --> 02:12:40,670
She's hot. Whatever. He goes up to, and
he's like, he's like, hey, hey, hello,

2064
02:12:40,760 --> 02:12:44,660
excuse me. And her back has
kind of turned, you know,
he's like, excuse me, hello?

2065
02:12:44,750 --> 02:12:47,870
Hello? Like getting any starts to get
real mad that she's not listening to him.

2066
02:12:48,740 --> 02:12:52,330
Finally he walks like more close to her
and she kind of starts to turn around

2067
02:12:52,331 --> 02:12:55,460
and he's like, oh, so now
you pay attention. What are
you deaf? And she's like,

2068
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:59,600
Bingo. Like signs to
them. Oh, she is death.

2069
02:12:59,900 --> 02:13:01,960
You know where you got to chill out.
Yeah.

2070
02:13:02,150 --> 02:13:04,550
I'll find out about people for free start.

2071
02:13:05,060 --> 02:13:09,680
They make sure the regimental sergeant
major isn't wounded and both legs before

2072
02:13:09,681 --> 02:13:12,900
you start dressing him
down. I know. Yeah, man,

2073
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:16,550
that's a good thing he put
that in this book. You know?

2074
02:13:16,551 --> 02:13:20,150
That's pretty humble for him to put
this in this book. You know what I mean?

2075
02:13:21,410 --> 02:13:25,820
And that other part where
there were all what?

2076
02:13:25,821 --> 02:13:29,900
Like tired and stuff, right? Or they're
defeated essentially. They were actually,

2077
02:13:29,990 --> 02:13:33,350
you mean when they were broken?
Men. Yeah. And then they,

2078
02:13:33,450 --> 02:13:36,960
and they got up and they just started
charging, getting that default aggressive.

2079
02:13:36,961 --> 02:13:41,310
Yeah. Yeah. The default, the default
aggressive apart. That's like, um,

2080
02:13:41,790 --> 02:13:46,680
like in Hawaii there's big centipedes no,
then they're like,

2081
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:51,260
they're kind of, they're like, no, no,

2082
02:13:51,270 --> 02:13:54,270
they're bigger than like send a
pizza that I've seen here. Okay.

2083
02:13:54,300 --> 02:13:57,030
Give me a figure like six inches,

2084
02:13:57,070 --> 02:14:00,400
12 it's six is like a normal,
big centerpiece.

2085
02:14:00,640 --> 02:14:05,530
Cinches they'll get bigger anyway
there. I mean, compared to you,

2086
02:14:05,610 --> 02:14:08,760
you know that there, there are little
bugs, they're little, right, whatever,

2087
02:14:09,060 --> 02:14:09,900
and you just step on it.

2088
02:14:09,930 --> 02:14:13,530
But like when you start messing
with it and it starts to get nuts,

2089
02:14:13,531 --> 02:14:17,910
it's superintendent,
I don't know.

2090
02:14:17,911 --> 02:14:21,710
But they can chase you out of your room.
You've got chased out of your robot,

2091
02:14:22,550 --> 02:14:23,190
even like a,

2092
02:14:23,190 --> 02:14:26,850
like a wasp or you don't like with these
little things that are way smaller than

2093
02:14:26,851 --> 02:14:29,850
you and they just get nuts and then, and
like, you didn't want to mess with it,

2094
02:14:29,851 --> 02:14:33,930
you know? So Lafe Lafe was over. My house
is a while ago, a couple of years ago.

2095
02:14:33,990 --> 02:14:34,823
And,
uh,

2096
02:14:35,880 --> 02:14:40,680
there was a lizard in my house
like about a nine inch lizard.

2097
02:14:41,250 --> 02:14:46,250
And so my son and Lafe are going
to try and catch this lizard and,

2098
02:14:46,530 --> 02:14:50,820
and they're being weak. They're like,
yeah, exactly. You're like, oh, you know,

2099
02:14:50,850 --> 02:14:53,650
they're like, oh wait, wait, no, grab
it, get a box on it and all that stuff.

2100
02:14:53,910 --> 02:14:57,960
So I come in, Mister tough guy,
you know, I come in, reached, I go,

2101
02:14:57,961 --> 02:15:01,320
just grab that thing.
You will cease reached down.

2102
02:15:01,350 --> 02:15:05,340
I reached down to grab this thing,
this thing turns its head and bytes

2103
02:15:07,130 --> 02:15:10,960
and I screamed like a,
like the Jim Carrey like right.

2104
02:15:11,030 --> 02:15:12,750
Oh yeah.

2105
02:15:12,830 --> 02:15:13,880
Flick my hand.
It was,

2106
02:15:13,881 --> 02:15:18,020
it was absolutely hilarious cause I went
from being a big tough guy to screaming,

2107
02:15:18,370 --> 02:15:18,800
um,

2108
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:19,880
oh,

2109
02:15:20,390 --> 02:15:24,350
having a lizard bit on my
finger Jube blood by the way.

2110
02:15:24,370 --> 02:15:28,580
I drew blood. Yeah. All my thumb. So yeah,

2111
02:15:28,581 --> 02:15:30,980
I was default aggressive, but
it didn't work out. The, the,

2112
02:15:31,030 --> 02:15:34,490
the lizard was more default aggressive
than I was. Yeah. See and the end,

2113
02:15:34,491 --> 02:15:37,670
that is funny. That's a funny story
for a couple of reasons in my opinion.

2114
02:15:37,820 --> 02:15:42,170
But that is the exact same concept
though. You know, where if you would, uh,

2115
02:15:42,200 --> 02:15:45,740
like how you said in the book just kept
your head. You smashed that Lizard,

2116
02:15:46,100 --> 02:15:49,340
all the five one to catch it alive.
I wasn't trying to kill it. Yeah.

2117
02:15:49,370 --> 02:15:52,160
But still I should have been
more aggressive like the
buyer and the bite didn't

2118
02:15:52,161 --> 02:15:56,780
even hurt. Right. Yeah. I just
shocked me. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2119
02:15:57,090 --> 02:16:00,920
I wasn't ready for the, the gnashing
of the teeth getting nuts. Yeah.

2120
02:16:00,921 --> 02:16:04,370
Those lizards, we have a lot of those,
especially when he gets hot. I mean,

2121
02:16:04,371 --> 02:16:07,580
I'm assuming it's the same time there
are these, but here's the thing.

2122
02:16:07,610 --> 02:16:11,030
Growing up on Kauai, there's these things
they call them, we call them chameleons,

2123
02:16:11,031 --> 02:16:14,910
but they're like, uh, no.
Uh, no. Lay a n, m, O, l. E,

2124
02:16:14,911 --> 02:16:19,180
that's he spent spell it. They, they turn
green or brown or whatever and they get,

2125
02:16:19,190 --> 02:16:23,210
they get pretty big and they're super
aggressive. Like when you grab them, oh,

2126
02:16:23,211 --> 02:16:24,400
that's the first lift.

2127
02:16:24,440 --> 02:16:29,340
Red thing comes out of their neck and
they start biting you and you get till

2128
02:16:29,360 --> 02:16:31,960
when you hold them after a while
they start to calm down. Yeah,

2129
02:16:32,170 --> 02:16:34,990
I think they just start to get
sick and stuff. I Dunno. I Dunno.

2130
02:16:35,020 --> 02:16:38,310
But they calmed down. So you can do
this thing where basically a kid, if he,

2131
02:16:38,311 --> 02:16:41,170
if you have the Lizard Ted,
you go like this and he'll go like that.

2132
02:16:41,171 --> 02:16:44,280
He'll try to bite you. So what you do
is when he comes down on it, what ray,

2133
02:16:44,300 --> 02:16:47,650
when you grab him, he's trying to kill
you. But when he calms down after,

2134
02:16:47,651 --> 02:16:50,440
I don't know, three, four minutes,
you do that and he'll kill,

2135
02:16:50,441 --> 02:16:53,740
keep kinda like he'll do less
and less and less. Less and less.

2136
02:16:53,741 --> 02:16:56,950
He'll always do that though,
but it'll just be a lot less aggressive.

2137
02:16:56,980 --> 02:16:59,980
And then if you put your finger in his
mouth, he'll bite you and he won't let go.

2138
02:17:00,340 --> 02:17:03,640
So you got to kind of drag
your finger out and yet it'll,

2139
02:17:03,700 --> 02:17:06,520
it can cause blood or whatever.
But what we do is,

2140
02:17:06,580 --> 02:17:10,690
and you can see pictures of this,
we do that and we'd put it on,

2141
02:17:10,810 --> 02:17:15,130
put the lizard on our ears. So the lizard
would be an earring and hearing yeah,

2142
02:17:15,131 --> 02:17:18,460
biting areas. You'd have two
lizards hanging down. But anyway,

2143
02:17:18,490 --> 02:17:23,380
the point there being
fun if you can keep your,

2144
02:17:23,381 --> 02:17:27,040
yeah, yeah. When you grow up with that
stuff, like those lizards are not scary.

2145
02:17:27,130 --> 02:17:29,080
Even if they're aggressive.
And some of them,

2146
02:17:29,081 --> 02:17:32,080
they get pretty like big and
bulky and they're like, Dang,

2147
02:17:32,081 --> 02:17:36,550
a state has some power to it. This little
lizard, you know. And, but even here I it,

2148
02:17:36,600 --> 02:17:39,160
when I grabbed them, they're like, oh no,

2149
02:17:39,190 --> 02:17:44,140
I wouldn't have screamed like you
explain the experiences with got me,

2150
02:17:44,141 --> 02:17:48,040
dude. It was awful. It
was awful. Well, um,

2151
02:17:49,030 --> 02:17:51,820
being prepared I guess is what we're
talking about, being aggressive.

2152
02:17:51,821 --> 02:17:55,030
Why don't you get default aggressive
with letting anybody know if they want to

2153
02:17:55,031 --> 02:17:57,610
support this podcast and
maybe how they could do it.

2154
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:03,000
Also support Jockos
traumatizing experience with
a lizard and this lizard bite

2155
02:18:03,130 --> 02:18:07,870
his fingers and he was
screaming, who wasn't leaf in
who it was late. And my son.

2156
02:18:07,900 --> 02:18:11,110
Yeah. Did they lose respect
for you that time? Well,

2157
02:18:11,500 --> 02:18:15,730
it's actually funny cause Lafe
always talks about, you know,

2158
02:18:15,731 --> 02:18:19,030
me being calm and that's
why he laughed so hard. We,

2159
02:18:19,220 --> 02:18:21,760
we were driving one time and
we almost got in a car wreck.

2160
02:18:21,761 --> 02:18:24,370
He was driving actually,
and I'll have him tell the story,

2161
02:18:24,371 --> 02:18:28,210
but we hit mud and we hit,
we were out in the desert,

2162
02:18:28,211 --> 02:18:32,800
we're going 65 miles an hour on a
back road back by all these farms.

2163
02:18:33,640 --> 02:18:36,310
And it was two o'clock in the morning,
three o'clock in the morning,

2164
02:18:36,311 --> 02:18:37,144
something like that.

2165
02:18:37,660 --> 02:18:41,020
And normally these roads are completely
dry there in the desert and we're

2166
02:18:41,021 --> 02:18:44,540
hauling and laced drive and I
think he's driving his truck. Okay.

2167
02:18:44,541 --> 02:18:48,580
What's driving this truck we're
hauling and all of a sudden,

2168
02:18:48,670 --> 02:18:49,810
out of nowhere we see,

2169
02:18:49,811 --> 02:18:54,220
we see a big 18 wheeler on the side of
the road on the opposite side of the road.

2170
02:18:54,220 --> 02:18:57,040
But it's a narrow road. Yeah.
Yeah. And as we're hauling,

2171
02:18:57,460 --> 02:19:02,460
all of a sudden we hit a water walker,

2172
02:19:03,210 --> 02:19:06,430
probably a couple inches
deep of water when mud,

2173
02:19:06,640 --> 02:19:08,500
because it's what happened somewhere.

2174
02:19:08,770 --> 02:19:12,670
Irrigation from all this farmland
had broken and there was this flood.

2175
02:19:13,330 --> 02:19:17,140
And so we hit this thing and we're
immediately hydroplaning and,

2176
02:19:17,380 --> 02:19:20,260
and Lafe is from Texas.
Lafe is from Texas.

2177
02:19:20,410 --> 02:19:22,450
So he did not used to driving in the snow.

2178
02:19:22,451 --> 02:19:24,490
I grew up driving in the snow in
New England. You know, you just,

2179
02:19:24,520 --> 02:19:27,500
you just deal with it. Everyone's like
a rally driver up there. Yeah. Yeah.

2180
02:19:27,560 --> 02:19:28,220
That's so sad.

2181
02:19:28,220 --> 02:19:31,310
So and so leaf,
he is not really used to this.

2182
02:19:31,610 --> 02:19:35,960
And he starts to oversteer the car, which
is really, really bad. And you know,

2183
02:19:35,961 --> 02:19:38,420
I'm sitting there and we're
going 65 miles an hour. He, he,

2184
02:19:38,660 --> 02:19:41,090
he's funny when he tells a
story too because he's like, we,

2185
02:19:41,180 --> 02:19:43,960
we thought we were going to
die. He thought he'd exactly,
we were definitely die.

2186
02:19:44,300 --> 02:19:46,340
And I'm sitting there in the
passenger seat and I, and I say,

2187
02:19:47,090 --> 02:19:51,440
don't oversteer don't overstay. No
breaks, no breaks. Alright, you're good.

2188
02:19:51,650 --> 02:19:54,500
Cause that's the other thing, mistake
you can make. If you jam on the brakes,

2189
02:19:54,890 --> 02:19:56,750
you're going to lock it up
and you're going to slide,

2190
02:19:56,780 --> 02:19:59,930
you're going to lose control. So I just
don't understand it. Don't oversteer.

2191
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:02,720
No breaks. No breaks.
Alright, you're good.

2192
02:20:04,160 --> 02:20:07,940
So that was not my reaction when I
got bit on the phone by the Lizard.

2193
02:20:08,870 --> 02:20:10,750
Ah,

2194
02:20:11,210 --> 02:20:12,043
it was hilarious.

2195
02:20:14,170 --> 02:20:18,250
Dang Bro. It's all good.
But Hey man, you know,

2196
02:20:18,310 --> 02:20:22,810
if you want to support this podcast, how
about this? Talk about that possible.

2197
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:27,670
Do it. So one good way and support this
is, well, okay. This is what it is.

2198
02:20:27,671 --> 02:20:32,470
Origin, right? Origin, the brand
origin main.com. That's the website.

2199
02:20:32,471 --> 02:20:36,730
They've got a lot of cool stuff.
One of the cool items, actually,

2200
02:20:36,731 --> 02:20:38,740
there's a bunch are geese for Jujitsu.

2201
02:20:39,400 --> 02:20:44,340
I remember back when kind of won't
be first started this thing that's,

2202
02:20:44,380 --> 02:20:47,620
that would be the main question about
did you too was what kind of gear?

2203
02:20:47,980 --> 02:20:51,010
And I'd be like, Oh yeah, there's
these. And I give them the three.

2204
02:20:51,011 --> 02:20:51,910
The top actually there was,

2205
02:20:51,940 --> 02:20:56,940
there's four of them and it was shortly
after where you recommended this,

2206
02:20:57,340 --> 02:21:00,910
these origin ones. And then when
I went there I was like, oh shoot,

2207
02:21:00,911 --> 02:21:03,100
this is kind of expensive.
I don't know. You know?

2208
02:21:03,340 --> 02:21:05,710
But then I just looked
at the one that was like,

2209
02:21:05,940 --> 02:21:07,320
it was like the first one I saw it,

2210
02:21:07,630 --> 02:21:12,630
but there are many varying prices
of keys and they're all good.

2211
02:21:14,981 --> 02:21:18,700
By the way, I know this because
I asked them nonetheless.

2212
02:21:19,480 --> 02:21:24,480
If you're still wondering what kind of
Geeky to get origin g hundred percent you

2213
02:21:24,881 --> 02:21:29,200
have, um, options, you know, as
far as pricing and stuff like that,

2214
02:21:29,201 --> 02:21:32,770
if you want the deluxe one versus the
more basic one. But they're all dope.

2215
02:21:32,860 --> 02:21:33,940
And here's the thing about them.

2216
02:21:35,380 --> 02:21:39,750
They're all made in America and not in
the sense where they're just kind of

2217
02:21:39,760 --> 02:21:43,630
assembled in America, but so, you know,
the materials are sourced somewhere else.

2218
02:21:44,290 --> 02:21:48,310
The materials are sourced.
Would you call him sourced?

2219
02:21:48,640 --> 02:21:52,630
I guess the raw material
material comes from Tennessee,

2220
02:21:53,020 --> 02:21:56,080
South Carolina, South Carolina,
somewhere here. America.

2221
02:21:56,260 --> 02:21:59,950
I know that mark boom
brought over to Maine.

2222
02:22:00,250 --> 02:22:04,930
Assembled smooth illume. Yeah,

2223
02:22:04,931 --> 02:22:07,780
that's not a verb, right?
Yeah. Woven on a loom,

2224
02:22:08,350 --> 02:22:12,790
boom into this outstanding material.
Moisture, what do you call it?

2225
02:22:12,980 --> 02:22:17,810
[inaudible] right. That's when it
kind of like helps with my sister.

2226
02:22:18,430 --> 02:22:19,630
I didn't know all this,
by the way.

2227
02:22:19,631 --> 02:22:23,560
I'm being educated on it and
there's lots to know by the way. Um,

2228
02:22:23,590 --> 02:22:25,830
and I antimicrobial a big deal

2229
02:22:28,710 --> 02:22:31,650
anyway. Or do you mean.com?
That's where you get school stuff.

2230
02:22:31,651 --> 02:22:35,730
There's other stuff too, like rash guards
and even like clothes, regular clothes,

2231
02:22:35,731 --> 02:22:40,200
athletic wear. It's still anyway,
all made in America. Boom.

2232
02:22:40,380 --> 02:22:45,380
Also for some legitimate
fitness gear on it.com/jocko.

2233
02:22:47,100 --> 02:22:50,760
I just got the, I know I'm
into kettlebells. I know
I said that before. I'm a,

2234
02:22:50,761 --> 02:22:54,350
say it again. What is yours?
What is your heaviest Kettlebell?

2235
02:22:54,630 --> 02:22:58,120
You have 40 kilograms,
right? So 88 dots. Okay.

2236
02:22:59,790 --> 02:23:04,550
Mine's 94, by the way. I have two
of them. Oh, do you only have one?

2237
02:23:04,600 --> 02:23:08,430
I do only have one. I only have
one currently. Alright, well shoot,

2238
02:23:08,431 --> 02:23:11,040
I guess you know, it's clear what I
gotta do. Maybe I'll get another one,

2239
02:23:11,080 --> 02:23:15,960
step it up. But um, shoot, who was
I talking to about it? Oh yeah,

2240
02:23:15,961 --> 02:23:18,340
Morgan, you know Morgan,
right? We were talking,

2241
02:23:18,430 --> 02:23:20,940
we were talking about kettle bells
and some Morgan's feeling strong.

2242
02:23:21,060 --> 02:23:23,970
I told him that yesterday. Yeah.
Not, not just because that's,

2243
02:23:24,690 --> 02:23:28,740
it's kind of an insult in
Jujitsu. Yes. Yeah. Like, Hey,

2244
02:23:28,741 --> 02:23:31,560
you feel really strong city.
Yeah,

2245
02:23:31,730 --> 02:23:34,440
but I made it perfectly clear
yesterday. I was like, Hey,

2246
02:23:34,800 --> 02:23:38,670
you feel Jujitsu strong? I said, it's not,

2247
02:23:38,671 --> 02:23:42,540
I'm not trying to say you
feel strong like, hey, you're
a meat, you're a meathead,

2248
02:23:42,860 --> 02:23:46,980
but you feel strong in a positive way
because, and I said, here's the deal.

2249
02:23:47,190 --> 02:23:51,060
If it was just you being strong than five
years ago when I started training here

2250
02:23:51,061 --> 02:23:52,230
and be like, oh, you feel strong.

2251
02:23:52,260 --> 02:23:53,880
I didn't say it then because
you didn't feel strong.

2252
02:23:53,970 --> 02:23:58,020
You feel strong now that your
juice is getting better and,

2253
02:23:58,110 --> 02:24:00,200
and you're getting more skills.
Yeah.

2254
02:24:00,210 --> 02:24:03,720
I feel like we got to come up with a
different expression or maybe just a

2255
02:24:03,721 --> 02:24:07,560
modified expression because
some people, yeah, like they'll,

2256
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:11,460
people tell me I'm strong or whatever,
and after awhile I was like, wait,

2257
02:24:11,910 --> 02:24:16,140
I felt the same thing that you one
time I told you like you're strong.

2258
02:24:16,470 --> 02:24:17,430
I thought it was kind of,

2259
02:24:17,460 --> 02:24:20,910
maybe subconsciously I thought it was
kind of established that, okay, look,

2260
02:24:20,911 --> 02:24:25,200
you're really good at Jujitsu. You know,
I thought that was kind of a given.

2261
02:24:25,260 --> 02:24:29,990
So if I were to tell you your song, it'd
be kind of like it. I like, Oh yeah.

2262
02:24:30,030 --> 02:24:33,090
I was like, we're like, no, my technique.
You're just like, no, my technique.

2263
02:24:33,091 --> 02:24:36,830
I was like, yeah, no, no. I know that. I
know your technique is outstanding. Yeah.

2264
02:24:36,840 --> 02:24:41,320
Little bit. Not In an angry way or
nothing like that, but actually surprise,

2265
02:24:41,840 --> 02:24:46,120
I wasn't, uh, a little bit more
sarcastic about it. See, okay.

2266
02:24:46,130 --> 02:24:48,780
And which to me, I'm surprised
that it and say, yeah,

2267
02:24:48,781 --> 02:24:51,600
I'm glad I'm so strong that I can just,
you know,

2268
02:24:52,410 --> 02:24:55,590
when people say it and I know people don't
mean it, I know they don't mean that.

2269
02:24:56,370 --> 02:25:00,180
How we take it kind of like you're
strong. It's your, your physical strength,

2270
02:25:00,190 --> 02:25:03,200
not your Jiu Jitsu technique.
That's what we take it as, you know,

2271
02:25:03,420 --> 02:25:06,630
and they're just throwing it in like
how essentially how I did with you.

2272
02:25:06,631 --> 02:25:09,570
It's kind of like, look, you're
better than you did to then me, you,

2273
02:25:09,720 --> 02:25:14,240
you beat me up all the time. But in
addition to that, you're pretty strong. I,

2274
02:25:14,430 --> 02:25:16,740
that's probably what people
were saying most of the time,

2275
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:21,440
but so when people would be like, Dang,
you're strong, your grip, you don't,

2276
02:25:21,530 --> 02:25:23,620
when they say you're strong, I
say yeah, I lift a lot of weights.

2277
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:26,350
So it kind of gives them the
impression kind of like yeah,

2278
02:25:26,351 --> 02:25:30,300
my weightlifting basically beats your
Jujitsu kind of thing and that's a more of

2279
02:25:30,310 --> 02:25:33,880
an insult, you know kind of
thing. But it's a joke really.

2280
02:25:33,970 --> 02:25:38,260
You know nonetheless.
So yes Morgan,

2281
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:43,220
he's strong Jujitsu so he's technique
is strong so that means it's just a

2282
02:25:43,240 --> 02:25:47,680
technique is getting better and it and
it reveals it can deliver the strength in

2283
02:25:47,681 --> 02:25:50,710
the proper way. Yes. Good Job Morgan.

2284
02:25:50,770 --> 02:25:52,810
But we were talking about kettle
bells and he was like, Bro,

2285
02:25:52,811 --> 02:25:53,830
cattle catapults off hard.

2286
02:25:53,950 --> 02:25:57,580
So I started to feel kind of good because
I got this 90 pound one and I was like,

2287
02:25:58,060 --> 02:26:01,360
I lifted it up and you know, okay. You
know that's the one hand boom, clean,

2288
02:26:02,350 --> 02:26:06,250
clean press is their eggs.
If you,

2289
02:26:06,251 --> 02:26:09,340
you should legs to snap it
up there a little bit. Yes.
That is the clean and jerk.

2290
02:26:09,370 --> 02:26:11,350
Okay.
Even one hand if you just do,

2291
02:26:11,740 --> 02:26:15,010
if you don't use any legs and you just
powered up smoothly, that's oppressed.

2292
02:26:15,070 --> 02:26:18,700
Okay. So mine is clean and jerk. I Turkeys
the whole kind of body or whatever.

2293
02:26:19,540 --> 02:26:24,370
So my metcons they do, when
I got the Werewolf ones,

2294
02:26:24,371 --> 02:26:28,660
those are like 62 pounds. I do two
at a time. Boom, boom. Okay. Easy.

2295
02:26:29,230 --> 02:26:30,910
And you'd do reps, you
know, it's a little thing.

2296
02:26:31,060 --> 02:26:36,060
So I got the s the gorilla one's 72 pounds
and I can do that one just as you get

2297
02:26:36,701 --> 02:26:40,450
strong, you know? So I get the 90 pound
one. I'm like, I only got one too.

2298
02:26:40,451 --> 02:26:44,140
So I dunno. Do you think two at one time
is easier because of the balance? Right?

2299
02:26:44,200 --> 02:26:47,290
No, it's not easier. I mean
you using more energy for sure.

2300
02:26:47,320 --> 02:26:51,160
But as far as like doing the
ballot, not easier. Yeah. Okay.

2301
02:26:51,310 --> 02:26:56,140
Well so one is easier doing
one. One is for sure. He's
okay. Good. Well, okay, Gotcha.

2302
02:26:56,380 --> 02:27:01,300
So I got one big foot that's 90 pounds
and I lifted that off. I was like, man,

2303
02:27:01,301 --> 02:27:02,610
I'm not right.

2304
02:27:04,720 --> 02:27:09,370
And so it was like maybe two, three days
later I was like, well, I got to try.

2305
02:27:09,371 --> 02:27:13,090
That's the, you know, I got the 72
pound one, I can do that, you know,

2306
02:27:13,091 --> 02:27:14,230
a bunch of times actually.

2307
02:27:14,380 --> 02:27:18,400
But so I just warmed up a bunch
and just first time I did it,

2308
02:27:18,401 --> 02:27:21,130
like I straight up failed, I couldn't
do it. And I was like, all right,

2309
02:27:21,131 --> 02:27:24,430
all right and I know how it feels now
and all this stuff and then then I can do

2310
02:27:24,431 --> 02:27:27,730
it. Boom. Both your boom.
Yeah. Well that's good. Solid.

2311
02:27:28,840 --> 02:27:32,770
Glad we all know that now. Yup.
Hey God. And that's relevant.

2312
02:27:33,070 --> 02:27:34,180
Just say actually,

2313
02:27:34,900 --> 02:27:38,920
which is actually what makes kettlebells
kind of fun to do is because it does

2314
02:27:38,921 --> 02:27:42,460
require legitimate technique.
Like you can't, like it's hard.

2315
02:27:42,750 --> 02:27:46,420
It's like a dumbbell or
a barbell or a machine.

2316
02:27:46,570 --> 02:27:50,440
If you're doing barbell
snatches, it takes a hell. Yeah.

2317
02:27:50,860 --> 02:27:53,260
And that's really the spectrum,
you know? So if you go,

2318
02:27:53,261 --> 02:27:55,930
like if you're just kettlebell and
then dumb cause dumbbells a straight up

2319
02:27:55,931 --> 02:27:57,580
balanced,
I mean they're not,

2320
02:27:57,670 --> 02:28:00,640
they're not like a PR but they have
a handle both sides of the handle,

2321
02:28:00,700 --> 02:28:02,530
equal amount of weight, you know, boom.

2322
02:28:02,531 --> 02:28:05,380
You just have to balance your body and
then after you get that balance down,

2323
02:28:05,381 --> 02:28:06,550
this pretty easy barbell,

2324
02:28:06,580 --> 02:28:09,580
even less because you don't have
two sides gotta be balanced.

2325
02:28:09,581 --> 02:28:12,310
It's just one long thing and then
two sides of that is balanced.

2326
02:28:12,580 --> 02:28:15,820
Then you go machine, you don't even need
balance. You just need this tank to push.

2327
02:28:15,821 --> 02:28:17,800
So it's that spectrum to the kettle bell.

2328
02:28:18,300 --> 02:28:20,230
It's way on this side of the
spectrum where it kind of,

2329
02:28:20,620 --> 02:28:23,930
there's the game within the game, you
know? That's what makes it more fun.

2330
02:28:24,110 --> 02:28:27,950
I think you see progress in both areas.
Technique and strength.

2331
02:28:30,380 --> 02:28:31,400
Anyway,
we'll leave it at that.

2332
02:28:31,430 --> 02:28:36,430
If you want the cool kettle
bells on it.com/jocko or
jump ropes battle maces the

2333
02:28:39,531 --> 02:28:43,340
weight, do you call them battle
Macy's or just maces yeah,

2334
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:46,760
those are kind of clubs. Yeah. Though
you can get some cool workouts with that.

2335
02:28:46,761 --> 02:28:50,740
And they like your forearms get
I,

2336
02:28:51,370 --> 02:28:54,290
I didn't look into like what exactly,

2337
02:28:54,470 --> 02:28:58,670
you know they're going to improve, but
I know core strength and all this stuff,

2338
02:28:58,671 --> 02:29:03,250
but there's all these little things
they improve to outstanding stuff. Also,

2339
02:29:04,160 --> 02:29:09,160
good way to support if you're going
to get this book men at how do you,

2340
02:29:09,710 --> 02:29:10,590
how do you pronounce it?

2341
02:29:10,600 --> 02:29:15,290
The place him art and Ham or
men aren't him Jeffry Powell.

2342
02:29:15,380 --> 02:29:19,070
That's how I pronounce it anyways. I'm
apologize to anyone that's from Holland.

2343
02:29:19,430 --> 02:29:21,200
Yeah.
And pronounces it a different way.

2344
02:29:21,201 --> 02:29:24,980
I looked at it on youtube and how they
set it and there was like they say, oh,

2345
02:29:25,100 --> 02:29:28,560
how to pronounce Our Name and
there's 14 different ways to say it.

2346
02:29:28,620 --> 02:29:33,050
So I just rolled the dice and pick one
that sounded easiest for me to say.

2347
02:29:33,140 --> 02:29:37,900
So sorry if I'm saying it wrong.
Hey Man. No, all good. Um,

2348
02:29:38,090 --> 02:29:43,090
but if you want to get that book or any
other book that Jack or reviews on the

2349
02:29:45,291 --> 02:29:49,400
website, just go to Jocko
podcast.com on the top menu.

2350
02:29:49,401 --> 02:29:51,920
Then click on books from episodes.

2351
02:29:52,520 --> 02:29:57,520
All the books are listed there by
episode along with the few other things,

2352
02:29:57,951 --> 02:30:01,520
but mainly just the books by episode.
You Click through there, boom,

2353
02:30:01,521 --> 02:30:04,670
takes you to Amazon, get those books
there. That's a good way to support this.

2354
02:30:04,671 --> 02:30:07,910
The Amazon Click through or
if you do any other shopping,

2355
02:30:08,030 --> 02:30:13,030
if you're getting a tripod or a video
camera or duct tape or whatever,

2356
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,820
click through there. Boom. That's a good
way to support. Great Way to support.

2357
02:30:17,690 --> 02:30:21,920
Also a little addition there.
You know how we had the uh,

2358
02:30:21,921 --> 02:30:25,820
website Jocko podcasts to [inaudible]
dot com that's a, there's a long story.

2359
02:30:25,820 --> 02:30:28,580
I think I went into it.
It was like when I was like testing,

2360
02:30:28,760 --> 02:30:30,770
like what website provider,
whatever. I was like,

2361
02:30:30,771 --> 02:30:35,360
let me get this one because what if I'm
attached to it and it's a long story and

2362
02:30:35,361 --> 02:30:40,190
then so we ended up getting
Jocko podcast.com and
they're both kind of there,

2363
02:30:40,191 --> 02:30:43,430
but Jack podcast too was kind of the,
the the primary one.

2364
02:30:44,690 --> 02:30:47,720
It's not the primary one anymore.
Jocko podcast.

2365
02:30:47,820 --> 02:30:51,700
It's Jocko podcast.com okay,
so that's good website.

2366
02:30:51,710 --> 02:30:53,210
And that was actually a trooper.

2367
02:30:53,211 --> 02:30:56,450
That's straight up goddess Jocko
podcast looking out for us cause he,

2368
02:30:56,550 --> 02:30:59,780
and then that's a big deal. So
I'm in New York. Good Dude. Yeah,

2369
02:31:00,110 --> 02:31:05,000
that's a huge deal because um, like
do you have your own name? Yeah.

2370
02:31:05,240 --> 02:31:08,900
Okay. So people will be like,
Oh this guy's blowing off.

2371
02:31:09,140 --> 02:31:10,820
They'll go and they'll
buy the domain name.

2372
02:31:10,821 --> 02:31:13,460
Either hold onto it or immediately
go to you and be like, Hey,

2373
02:31:13,461 --> 02:31:17,300
you want to buy this from me? Yeah,
they hold it hostage. In fact,

2374
02:31:17,301 --> 02:31:21,300
I think there might be like a
legal like defense against it.

2375
02:31:21,301 --> 02:31:22,680
Like if someone gets your name or your,

2376
02:31:22,681 --> 02:31:27,570
your kid's name and your kind of a public
figures, I think, I'm not sure. But yeah,

2377
02:31:27,571 --> 02:31:28,560
that's what people do.
Men,

2378
02:31:28,680 --> 02:31:32,310
they'll or they'll buy a bunch of domain
names that sound cool and they'll be

2379
02:31:32,311 --> 02:31:35,820
like, yeah, you can buy
this from me kind of thing.

2380
02:31:35,850 --> 02:31:38,790
It's super whack when they do it
with like Euro, you know when,

2381
02:31:38,980 --> 02:31:42,970
no, that's your company or your
CEO hat for a long time. They,

2382
02:31:42,971 --> 02:31:46,660
I don't know what they paid for eventually
paid for ufc.com but for a long time

2383
02:31:46,661 --> 02:31:51,280
they were like the ufc.tv and all these
other UFC, but they had to step up.

2384
02:31:51,281 --> 02:31:54,630
I bet you they, I bet somebody made
a lot of money off that one. Yeah.

2385
02:31:55,540 --> 02:31:57,400
Especially the three letters I guess.

2386
02:31:57,401 --> 02:31:59,290
Like if you get the last
letter tomorrow morning,

2387
02:32:00,530 --> 02:32:04,320
crazy town nonetheless. But yeah, Jocko,
podcast.com that's the main website.

2388
02:32:04,330 --> 02:32:09,010
Now if you were going to Jocko podcast
too.com, it's not that anymore.

2389
02:32:09,040 --> 02:32:13,990
Does that sound to you though over? Uh,
it, it does. Did, but while I'm switching,

2390
02:32:13,991 --> 02:32:18,340
I'm doing this thing. It will eventually,
yes. But if you run into that,

2391
02:32:18,341 --> 02:32:23,140
that's why God will have been hitting
me up and rightly so. Thanks for that.

2392
02:32:24,010 --> 02:32:25,690
Um, so yeah, none the
less back to the point.

2393
02:32:25,720 --> 02:32:29,860
If you want to support and by getting
these books go through the website and

2394
02:32:29,861 --> 02:32:33,940
clicked through there, it's a good way
to support small action. Huge reaction.

2395
02:32:34,030 --> 02:32:37,990
Small, huge. That's how it works.
Also, subscribe to the podcast

2396
02:32:40,450 --> 02:32:42,340
iTunes. If you haven't already, stitcher,

2397
02:32:42,400 --> 02:32:47,400
if you don't use I o s I film Google play
any anywhere they where they provide a

2398
02:32:49,301 --> 02:32:53,560
podcast. Boom, we're on
there. So subscribe. That's
a good way. Also Youtube.

2399
02:32:54,730 --> 02:32:58,840
Yes. I put some excerpts on there. More
excerpts. I'm gonna continue to do so.

2400
02:32:58,841 --> 02:33:03,220
Shareable excerpts. Tried to
keep them under four minutes.
That's cool. Right? For

2401
02:33:03,390 --> 02:33:04,890
Yeah.
Might be a little long.

2402
02:33:04,891 --> 02:33:08,670
But I every once in a while you get it
like a good like 10 minute one though for

2403
02:33:08,671 --> 02:33:09,504
sure thing.

2404
02:33:09,630 --> 02:33:14,040
But they're more shit better than to
think about what the video is that you,

2405
02:33:14,190 --> 02:33:17,970
you want to get compression. Three
minutes, four minutes tops. Yeah.

2406
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:21,600
And it depends on the, you should edit
them. Maybe like make them shorter.

2407
02:33:21,890 --> 02:33:24,670
Hmm. Yeah. Yeah.

2408
02:33:24,700 --> 02:33:27,670
I mean if it's appropriate because
sometimes you don't want to,

2409
02:33:28,600 --> 02:33:32,830
sometimes it's just you saying like a
whole thing and it's like okay that's

2410
02:33:32,831 --> 02:33:34,420
solid and sometimes it's you.

2411
02:33:34,421 --> 02:33:38,560
And then my rebuttal to kind of kind
of bolster the point, your point.

2412
02:33:38,680 --> 02:33:43,480
Cause you'll clarify it because I, you
know, and it's all, it's, it makes sense.

2413
02:33:43,810 --> 02:33:47,590
So sometimes if you edit certain things
out and maybe the message isn't there as

2414
02:33:47,591 --> 02:33:50,320
much as maybe it should be. Not
all the time, not all the time,

2415
02:33:50,530 --> 02:33:53,380
but most of the time unless I'll
look into it. How about that?

2416
02:33:55,090 --> 02:33:57,310
Ideally if a video,

2417
02:33:57,880 --> 02:34:02,880
and this goes along with like people's
typical like attention span should be

2418
02:34:04,300 --> 02:34:06,230
what?
Like about a minute and a half.

2419
02:34:06,280 --> 02:34:08,750
I don't know. But my attention span
is getting tested right now. Right.

2420
02:34:11,730 --> 02:34:12,090
Just

2421
02:34:12,090 --> 02:34:14,250
saying we this is important stuff.

2422
02:34:14,251 --> 02:34:19,120
We need to go over this so we can come
to the conclusion on how to conduct

2423
02:34:19,121 --> 02:34:22,960
ourselves in regards to youtube
excerpts and other things.

2424
02:34:23,920 --> 02:34:26,470
Nonetheless, subscribe to
Youtube Channel. It's good.

2425
02:34:26,530 --> 02:34:30,730
We're going to provide
value. How about that? No.

2426
02:34:31,150 --> 02:34:35,980
All if you're into the video version,
cause some people are,

2427
02:34:35,981 --> 02:34:40,390
some people are into more
the video version of the
podcast. Yeah. You know, boom.

2428
02:34:40,391 --> 02:34:45,130
Subscribe if you haven't already.
Youtube also Jocko has a store.

2429
02:34:45,930 --> 02:34:47,050
It's called Jocko store.

2430
02:34:47,110 --> 02:34:49,780
Jacqueline [inaudible] dot com and

on there we've got some cool stuff.
Shirts, mainly some rash guards.

2432
02:34:53,920 --> 02:34:56,620
I just made an order for
hoodies. Thicker, heavier

2433
02:34:58,450 --> 02:35:00,640
fall is coming.
Are we in fall right now?

2434
02:35:00,820 --> 02:35:05,260
The fall was the first day of fall was
like the other day we are in fall. Yeah.

2435
02:35:05,261 --> 02:35:07,660
So we got some, not that we're
doing a whole seasonal thing.

2436
02:35:07,660 --> 02:35:10,660
I'm just saying it's fall now.

2437
02:35:10,690 --> 02:35:13,720
Getting cool eating cooler check.
Got Some hoodies on there.

2438
02:35:13,721 --> 02:35:16,060
I've got some shirts on there.
Got some rash guards on there.

2439
02:35:16,930 --> 02:35:19,810
I think I'm going to do
a warrior kid rash guard.

2440
02:35:20,680 --> 02:35:25,480
I have one but it's not in production yet.

2441
02:35:25,510 --> 02:35:27,970
Yeah. And it's not, I'm going
to change it a little bit,

2442
02:35:27,971 --> 02:35:31,450
some coloring stuff and whatever,
but it is pretty cool. Good,

2443
02:35:31,451 --> 02:35:34,620
good little pre response.
Um,

2444
02:35:34,930 --> 02:35:37,810
also hats on there and
some other cool stuff.

2445
02:35:37,990 --> 02:35:42,790
I'm not saying get something I'm
saying go on there, check it out.

2446
02:35:42,820 --> 02:35:45,520
If you want to support and
you want to get something,

2447
02:35:45,521 --> 02:35:50,460
he thinks something is cool for yourself
or for your, you know, friend, wife,

2448
02:35:50,740 --> 02:35:53,440
girlfriend, neighbor, whoever.

2449
02:35:53,620 --> 02:35:57,520
Didn't get something good way to support
actually a great way to support also

2450
02:35:58,360 --> 02:36:02,350
psychological warfare. Okay.
What psychological warfare
is. If you don't know,

2451
02:36:02,560 --> 02:36:06,220
it's an album
with Jocko tracks.

2452
02:36:06,310 --> 02:36:11,310
So basically if you're on your campaign
against weakness and you have a moment

2453
02:36:13,181 --> 02:36:14,950
of weakness,
this is like a little spot.

2454
02:36:14,951 --> 02:36:19,690
So basically you put on these
audio tracks to let you know,

2455
02:36:19,691 --> 02:36:24,430
hey, pragmatically, don't
skip this workout today. Hey,

2456
02:36:24,460 --> 02:36:26,440
don't slip on this diet today.
Hey,

2457
02:36:26,441 --> 02:36:29,440
your procrastination isn't
working and here's why,

2458
02:36:29,530 --> 02:36:33,940
but it's chocolate telling you.
So it's kind of like more effective,

2459
02:36:34,510 --> 02:36:39,010
way more effective. Hundred percent
success rate in my experience.

2460
02:36:39,011 --> 02:36:39,760
100%

2461
02:36:39,760 --> 02:36:44,200
that's legit. Yeah. A also
Jocko white tea, if you want it,

2462
02:36:44,230 --> 02:36:45,280
you can get that on Amazon.

2463
02:36:45,370 --> 02:36:50,370
It tastes good and it makes you feel
good also on origin main.com you can get

2464
02:36:53,080 --> 02:36:57,250
Jocko Super Krill Krill oil
that will make you feel good.

2465
02:36:57,790 --> 02:37:01,450
And on top of that you can
get Jocko joint warfare,

2466
02:37:01,750 --> 02:37:04,840
which is awesome. What's
in that, by the way?

2467
02:37:04,990 --> 02:37:09,610
It's glucosomine can droid and
those are the main, the main,

2468
02:37:09,611 --> 02:37:13,720
but then we put some additional
things in there. Um, yeah, and it's,

2469
02:37:13,721 --> 02:37:16,110
it's been rocking it.
It's,

2470
02:37:16,180 --> 02:37:21,050
it's awesome. You've got books or I've
got some books if you want to read them.

2471
02:37:21,140 --> 02:37:25,490
One is called way of the warrior kid.
One is called extreme ownership.

2472
02:37:25,760 --> 02:37:27,440
The Warrior kid book is for kids.

2473
02:37:27,920 --> 02:37:30,800
Extreme ownership is for
people in leadership positions
or people that want to

2474
02:37:30,801 --> 02:37:31,670
be in leadership positions.

2475
02:37:32,090 --> 02:37:35,450
There's also a new book coming out called
discipline equals freedom field manual.

2476
02:37:35,451 --> 02:37:40,451
It actually comes out October 17th
and at one point many months ago,

2477
02:37:40,731 --> 02:37:44,450
October 17th seemed like it was a
long ways away, but it's not anymore.

2478
02:37:44,870 --> 02:37:47,000
It's here so you can order that one.

2479
02:37:47,060 --> 02:37:51,470
It is unlike any book that you
have ever seen or read. Also,

2480
02:37:51,471 --> 02:37:54,080
what's interesting about this book is
people keep asking me if it's going to be

2481
02:37:54,081 --> 02:37:58,820
on the audible is not going to be on
audible. Hmm. Instead of being on audible,

2482
02:37:58,900 --> 02:38:01,390
it is going to be on iTunes.
It's going to be on Amazon,

2483
02:38:01,400 --> 02:38:05,450
MP three it's going to be on Google play.

2484
02:38:05,600 --> 02:38:09,290
It's going to be where you
can find MP three tracks.

2485
02:38:09,530 --> 02:38:12,470
There's a reason for this.
If you do it through audible,

2486
02:38:12,500 --> 02:38:17,480
you get this one big long book
and it's in what the book is.

2487
02:38:17,481 --> 02:38:18,470
The way the book is written,

2488
02:38:18,471 --> 02:38:23,270
it's written to be chunked up and you're
going to want to take parts of it and

2489
02:38:23,271 --> 02:38:26,870
play it at certain times more like you
would do with the psychological warfare

2490
02:38:26,871 --> 02:38:30,140
album. So people were asking
for more psychological warfare.

2491
02:38:30,200 --> 02:38:32,300
That's what we're doing.
Discipline equals freedom field manual.

2492
02:38:32,301 --> 02:38:36,200
It's going to be available as an album
that you can buy and then you can do what

2493
02:38:36,201 --> 02:38:38,810
you want with the tracks.
You can make them your alarm ring tone,

2494
02:38:39,080 --> 02:38:43,070
you can listen to them out of order in
any order. You can put them into mixed.

2495
02:38:43,071 --> 02:38:44,450
You can do a lot more stuff with them.

2496
02:38:44,451 --> 02:38:49,451
That's why we're doing it as an album
with tracks instead of as an audible book.

2497
02:38:51,470 --> 02:38:53,810
So you know what we might,
you know,

2498
02:38:53,811 --> 02:38:56,990
people might have a little
challenge finding it or realizing,

2499
02:38:57,140 --> 02:39:00,080
you know when they go on to Amazon
or they go on to Barnes and noble,

2500
02:39:00,081 --> 02:39:03,350
they won't see that it's available.
There'll be looking for the audible.

2501
02:39:03,380 --> 02:39:04,310
Then you won't be able to find it.

2502
02:39:04,380 --> 02:39:07,950
I'm sorry. Yeah, we'll just an audible,
I think that's where they won't,

2503
02:39:08,120 --> 02:39:11,750
you won't find it in the audible
platform, right? Will not be there.

2504
02:39:11,820 --> 02:39:13,860
It'll be on Amazon.
It'll be on Amazon,

2505
02:39:13,861 --> 02:39:18,780
but I don't think it will be linked
in to the same thing where you go, oh,

2506
02:39:18,781 --> 02:39:21,240
here it is. I think it's going to be
hidden and it's gonna be hard to find.

2507
02:39:21,241 --> 02:39:22,470
Kind of like,
it's hard to find on iTunes.

2508
02:39:22,471 --> 02:39:26,040
It's hard to find psychological warfare,
but the question is, do you want to do,

2509
02:39:26,160 --> 02:39:30,300
did I want to do something right or just
do something easy? Yeah, that's true.

2510
02:39:30,301 --> 02:39:32,910
Because the field manual,
like any field manual,

2511
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:34,980
like when you want to go refer to it,

2512
02:39:35,480 --> 02:39:40,410
you don't want to be searching around and
be like, okay, what does that one part?

2513
02:39:40,460 --> 02:39:43,100
You know that deals with this and boom,
you can just go to them.

2514
02:39:43,320 --> 02:39:45,990
You just look for the track
name and either, so like I said,

2515
02:39:46,230 --> 02:39:47,970
we could have done the easy thing and and

2516
02:39:48,200 --> 02:39:51,500
whatever, you know, had everyone just
being able to click on it real easy.

2517
02:39:51,890 --> 02:39:55,040
I apologize, but if you want the right
way then that's what I had to do.

2518
02:39:55,880 --> 02:40:00,170
So that's that book
and then Echelon Front,

2519
02:40:00,500 --> 02:40:05,500
that's the leadership consultant company
that I have with wave Babin with JP to

2520
02:40:06,571 --> 02:40:07,490
know Dave Burke.

2521
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:12,620

2528
02:40:34,451 --> 02:40:39,451
And finally thanks to everyone out there
for making this podcast possible to

2529
02:40:41,711 --> 02:40:43,090
those of you in the military,

2530
02:40:43,120 --> 02:40:48,120
especially those right now on the forward
line of our own troops facing evil

2531
02:40:50,381 --> 02:40:51,214
every day.

2532
02:40:52,240 --> 02:40:57,000
Thank you for providing this freedom
that we enjoy and to the first responders

2533
02:40:57,001 --> 02:40:59,620
and law enforcements in fire and EMS.

2534
02:40:59,650 --> 02:41:04,650
Thank you for taking care of us while
we are here at home and the rest of you

2535
02:41:07,170 --> 02:41:12,170
that are out there that are working and
building and producing and creating and

2536
02:41:15,661 --> 02:41:18,720
leading
keep bleeding.

2537
02:41:20,160 --> 02:41:24,780
Keep stepping up,
keep taking on challenges,

2538
02:41:24,781 --> 02:41:28,590
and keep striving to
do more and to be more,

2539
02:41:28,620 --> 02:41:33,620
keep picking up the pace and keep pushing
harder and no matter what the odds or

2540
02:41:38,111 --> 02:41:39,670
what the probabilities,

2541
02:41:41,620 --> 02:41:43,900
keep getting after it.

2542
02:41:46,080 --> 02:41:50,130
So until next time,
this is echo and Jocko

2543
02:41:51,630 --> 02:41:51,930
out.
