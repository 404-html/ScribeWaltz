1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,890
This is Jocko podcast number
one 58 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,010
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,950
There was blood all over the
floor and smoke in the air.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,520
I heard shots fired outside,

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,840
but I wasn't quite sure who was
shooting or what they were shooting at.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:23,580
Okay.

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,360
I moved down the hallway confirming
that all the rooms had been cleared.

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,810
I soon found the source of the blood.

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,070
I wounded Iraqi civilian on
who my seal hospital corpsman.

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,370
A highly trained combat medic was
working to apply medical care.

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,700
Yeah,

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,440
and that's just a short little
opening from chapter two of the book,

13
00:00:47,441 --> 00:00:51,910
the dichotomy of leadership with a that
I wrote with my brother Leif Babin and

14
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:56,911
in that chapter I go on to explain how
during this operation in Fallujah Iraq,

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,320
we went on to detain multiple
suspected terrorists that night.

16
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,210
And I don't go into much detail about
that and I don't talk about the people

17
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:12,190
that we captured. We
tick, I think we've took,

18
00:01:12,191 --> 00:01:16,480
I think we took about
13 people off target,

19
00:01:16,481 --> 00:01:20,320
military aged males. We were probably
looking for two or three. We weren't,

20
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:23,080
couldn't figure out or
confirm who they were.

21
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,210
So we brought all the military aged
males off target and so we end up at this

22
00:01:28,211 --> 00:01:33,160
detention facility and we're turning
these individuals over and I'm sitting

23
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:36,040
there kind of
just looking at him,

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,380
just sizing him up.

25
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,040
This was one of their earliest
operations I had done in my life.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,790
It was the first big
operation I did in Iraq.

27
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,500
And so I'm sort of curious,
I guess for lack of a better word,

28
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:53,140
and I'm looking at the people
that we had captured. Like I said,

29
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:55,720
I think there's 13 of them
and just looking at them,

30
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,480
looking at their emotions that they were
going through and some of them looks

31
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:03,850
scared, right. In fact, I would say
the majority from just look scared,

32
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,980
just this is not good and this is a bad
situation. And you get that feeling like,

33
00:02:08,981 --> 00:02:13,570
okay, this guy is probably
not bad and will be released.

34
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,080
Some of the guys looked mad, which
is understandable to, you know,

35
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,410
someone comes into your house in the
middle of night and then takes you and you

36
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:24,070
can be mad about that. If you can
overcome the scared part. Right.

37
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,010
And of course these people had
lived under Saddam Hussein,

38
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:28,960
so they'd been through some brutal stuff.

39
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:33,010
And for them to be not afraid
was also an understandable thing.

40
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:36,130
Some of the older gentlemen.
And then

41
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,500
there was one guy though that he looked,

42
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:44,440
he looked different.
The look in his eyes,

43
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,900
it will definitely wasn't scared,
but it wasn't even mad.

44
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:53,200
It was like beyond mad.
It was beyond angry.

45
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:56,560
It was beyond a fanatical look.

46
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,840
The look that he had in his

47
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,080
was evil look like any evil.

48
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,870
We could see evil there and I
never will forget that that face

49
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:17,490
and I would see that type of
face again over the years.

50
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,250
Yeah,
especially in Iraq,

51
00:03:22,251 --> 00:03:27,251
you'd go out and capture someone that
was known for doing horrible things and

52
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,420
you could tell you need grab five
or six people and you'd say, Oh,

53
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,060
let me guess which one is the bad guy.

54
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,720
And usually wasn't very hard to tell.

55
00:03:38,721 --> 00:03:41,630
And then occasionally some of
those bad guys would just look,

56
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,250
they looked completely evil. They look
like sadists, they look like murderers.

57
00:03:46,251 --> 00:03:49,520
They, they had the face of evil.
You could see it in their eyes.

58
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,660
And I was,

59
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,100
yeah,

60
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:00,050
watching a video recently of a,
a young,

61
00:04:00,051 --> 00:04:03,020
beautiful young girl,
blonde hair,

62
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,220
kind of unkempt blonde hair,
a little bit wild,

63
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:13,510
and she had a like a constant persistent
smile sort of shining on her face.

64
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:21,730
She had young little innocent
eyes that were filled with hope.

65
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,040
Okay.

66
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,040
And I watched this video and
she says in the video she says,

67
00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:31,670
my name is Louisa.

68
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:37,230
I'm young lady from Denmark and I have
a burning desire to go out into the

69
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:41,640
Arctic. And she's going on kind
of describing herself. She says,

70
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:44,910
I'm very enthusiastic about the
outdoors and outdoor activities.

71
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,690
I'm studying outdoor life,
Norway for this same reason.

72
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,970
I'm trying to find my dream.

73
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,910
She says to go into the Arctic,

74
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:03,110
but sometimes I take some detours before
I end up where I want in the video.

75
00:05:04,411 --> 00:05:09,411
She's got clips of her in various parts
of the world on beaches and in jungles

76
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:11,970
and she's clearly a traveler.

77
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,181
And then she says,

78
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:19,740
but I'm still working my
way towards the north.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,770
Yeah,

80
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,630
a dream that has been stuck in my head

81
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,810
and I hope,
wish and pray

82
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,620
that I can retrieve my dream,

83
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:39,980
our dream of experiencing the feeling
of kicking a dog sled through the big

84
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:40,843
Arctic

85
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,740
about feeling the ice crystals in my face,

86
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,770
in the view of an
infinite white landscape.

87
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,700
I dream about learning and
experiencing the magnificent,

88
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,310
untamed Arctic.

89
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,800
And the video ends with her picking
up snow in her hands and she blows it

90
00:06:09,841 --> 00:06:13,140
innocently into the camera
lens and she's laughing.

91
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,750
Okay.

92
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,940
And then the video fades,

93
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,650
but she was not able to fulfill her dream.

94
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,220
In fact,
she entered a nightmare

95
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,160
and didn't return

96
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,350
on December 17th,
2018 that girl who made that video,

97
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,120
her name was Louisa Jespersen
and her friend Marin Youland,

98
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,240
another beautiful young lady from Norway.

99
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,520
They were browth brutally,

100
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,020
brutally murdered by a group of

101
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,400
subhuman savages

102
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,590
as they camped beside a
hiking trail in Morocco.

103
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,220
And these despicable in viral people.

104
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,500
And I use that term loosely,
these,

105
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:26,530
these savages that murdered these two
girls actually recorded their disgusting

106
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:30,590
acts and posted them on mine.

107
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,653
Yeah.

108
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,320
They
attack these girls.

109
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:43,680
They saw through their
throats with butcher knives

110
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,230
while they were still alive.

111
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:49,950
Okay.

112
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,060
While they were screaming,

113
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,020
while they were gasping for air,

114
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:59,850
while they were begging for mercy and
while they were eventually gurgling in

115
00:07:59,851 --> 00:08:01,740
their own blood

116
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,380
and then fell silent,

117
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,050
and one of the murderers put his foot
on one of the girls' heads to hold her

118
00:08:16,051 --> 00:08:18,720
neck in place while he finished the job

119
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,510
of decapitating her.

120
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,013
Yeah,

121
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,240
and these sub humans pledged
their allegiance to isis

122
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,840
and shouted,
it's all laws will

123
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:48,240
as they killed these
innocent girls.

124
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:52,803
Okay.

125
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,170
Sick,
depraved

126
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,970
vial
creatures,

127
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,143
evil.

128
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,903
Yeah.

129
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,440
Evil does exist.

130
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,040
Here's a nother example

131
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,913
of evil.

132
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:36,220
I started doing time when I was 11 years
old and have been doing practically

133
00:09:36,231 --> 00:09:40,520
nothing else since then. What
time? I haven't been in jail.

134
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:43,340
I've spent either getting
out or getting in again.

135
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:44,980
Yeah.

136
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,860
I have no desire,
whatever to reform myself.

137
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,280
My only desire is to reform
people who try to reform me,

138
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,950
and I believe the only
way to reform people

139
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,153
is to kill them.

140
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,040
In my lifetime,
I have murdered 21 human beings.

141
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,780
I've committed thousands of
burglaries, robberies, larcenies,

142
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,180
arsons,
and last but not least,

143
00:10:10,181 --> 00:10:14,530
I have committed sodomy on more
than 1000 male human beings.

144
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:21,580
For all of these things, I
am not the least bit, sorry,

145
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,510
I have no conscience,
so that doesn't worry me.

146
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:29,960
Okay.

147
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,900
I don't believe in man,
God nor devil.

148
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,550
I hate the whole damn human race.

149
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,220
Yeah.

150
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,540
Including myself.

151
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:47,570
I prayed upon the week,
the harmless and the unsuspecting.

152
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,840
This lesson I was taught by others

153
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,650
might makes right

154
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,330
Carl Pans Ram number
three one six one four

155
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:13,220
and that is the opening
of a book called Pans.

156
00:11:13,221 --> 00:11:16,220
Ram.
Journal of a murderer.

157
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,310
Yeah,

158
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,170
Carl Pans.
Ram was evil.

159
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,240
He was institutionalized for most of his
life in detention centers and prisons

160
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:34,540
and whatever may have been good about
him at one time or another was eventually

161
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:35,374
suffocated.

162
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,980
And what was left was
pure on mitigated hatred

163
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,730
and malevolence.

164
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,150
And while he was going through
one of his final stance in prison,

165
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:55,600
he made friends with a young
prison by the name of Henry Lesser.

166
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,840
Then Henry lesser seemed like
a very good positive person.

167
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,830
Kind of had the ideal of reform.

168
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,530
Now people could be helped in his mind,

169
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,120
and Henry asked that Pans Ram,
right? The story of his life, which,

170
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,440
which pans ram did.

171
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,070
Yeah.

172
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:25,020
Then the notes were save,
saved and documented,

173
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:30,110
and there was additional information from
various supporting sources surrounding

174
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,520
other details of pans, rams, life,

175
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,660
and all of that was put together
and turned into this book,

176
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,150
which though it is a very difficult read.

177
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,100
Yeah.

178
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,690
It's in my opinion, worth reading
to gather a better understanding of

179
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:57,550
of human nature and specifically
of the capacity for men

180
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:01,910
to commit evil.

181
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,720
So again, most of this that I'm
going to read from the book is

182
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,920
his work, his writing,
Carl pans, rems, writing.

183
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:23,250
And here we go. Back to the
book. I was born June 28th,

184
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,210
1891 on a small farm in
Minnesota. My parents were of
German descent, hardworking,

185
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,380
ignorant,
and poor.

186
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,950
The rest of the family consisted
of five brothers and one sister,

187
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,220
all of whom are dead except three
of us brothers and our sister.

188
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,080
All of my family are as the
average human beings are.

189
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,070
They're honest and hardworking people.
All except myself.

190
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,610
I've been a human animal ever since
I was born. When I was very young,

191
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:56,590
at five or six years of age, I was a
fief and a liar and the older I got,

192
00:13:56,591 --> 00:14:01,550
the meaner I got
as fast as the older boys grew up,

193
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,540
they also pulled out one died.
They, this left me and my sister,

194
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,130
one older brother and my mother.

195
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,323
Okay.

196
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,910
My sister and I were sent to school during
the days and as soon as we came home

197
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:13,511
in the evenings,

198
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:16,720
we were put to work in the fields where
my older brother and my mother were

199
00:14:16,721 --> 00:14:19,510
always at work from daylight
until long after dark.

200
00:14:19,511 --> 00:14:24,390
Sometimes my portion of pay consisted
of plenty of work and a sound,

201
00:14:24,391 --> 00:14:24,791
a beating.

202
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:29,140
Every time I looked cockeyed or done
anything that displeased anyone who is

203
00:14:29,141 --> 00:14:32,800
older and stronger and Cape and able
to catch me and kick me around whenever

204
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:37,630
they felt like it and it seemed to me
and still does now that everything was

205
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:41,600
always right for the one who was the
strongest and every single thing that I'd

206
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,490
done was wrong.

207
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,200
Okay.

208
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:49,060
Everybody said so anyway, but right or
wrong, I used to get plenty of abuse.

209
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,960
Everybody thought it was all
right to deceive me, lie to
me, and kicked me around.

210
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:57,080
Whenever they felt like it,
then they felt like it pretty regular.

211
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:58,870
Yeah.

212
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:02,140
That is the way my life was lived
until I was about 11 years old.

213
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,310
At about that time,

214
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:06,400
I began to suspect that there was
something wrong about the treatment I was

215
00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:11,200
getting from the rest of the human race.
When I was about 11 years old,

216
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:15,190
I began to hear and see that there were
other places in this world besides my

217
00:15:15,191 --> 00:15:16,500
own little corner of it.

218
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,630
I began to realize that there
were other people who live nice,

219
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:24,020
easy lives and were not kicked
around and work to death.

220
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,073
Yeah.

221
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,520
I decided that I wanted to leave
my miserable home before I left.

222
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,940
I looked around and figured that one
of our neighbors who was rich and had a

223
00:15:33,941 --> 00:15:35,470
nice home full of Nice things,

224
00:15:35,471 --> 00:15:38,950
hat he had too much and I had two little
so one night I broke into his home and

225
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:42,490
stole everything to that to my eyes.
Had the most value,

226
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,110
those things where some apples,
some cake and a great big pistol.

227
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,260
Okay.

228
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,960
Eating the apples and cake and
carrying the pistol under my coat.

229
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,770
I walked to the railroad yards where I
caught a freight train going to the West

230
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:57,350
where I intended to be a
cowboy and shoot Indians,

231
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,090
but I must've had my wires crossed
because I missed my connection somewhere.

232
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,030
Instead of going out and seeing the world,
I was caught,

233
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:09,260
brought back home and beaten half to
death and sent to jail from there.

234
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,710
And from there to the Minnesota state
training school at Redwing, Minnesota.

235
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:14,940
Yeah,

236
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,110
right there. And then I began to
learn about man's inhumanity to man.

237
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:27,020
So he's off to a rough start and it was
his father had left him and I didn't

238
00:16:27,061 --> 00:16:30,750
mention that part. Obviously I'm
not reading every part of the book,

239
00:16:30,751 --> 00:16:34,170
but his father left the family
and then it was up to his mom.

240
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,630
Sounds like he had the, uh,
more than his share of the,

241
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,320
the rebellious streak that
I think most kids have.

242
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,010
And then he shows up at this Minnesota,

243
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,130
Minnesota state training
school back to the book.

244
00:16:50,131 --> 00:16:53,340
When I first went to the Minnesota
state trait, the state training school,

245
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,450
I was about 12 years old, lively,
healthy, and very mischievous,

246
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:02,310
innocent and ignorant. The law immediately
proceeded to educate me to be a good,

247
00:17:02,311 --> 00:17:05,520
clean, upright citizen and
a credit to the human race.

248
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,740
They trained me all right in that
training school, during my two years,

249
00:17:10,741 --> 00:17:14,460
I was trained by two different sets of
people to have two different sets of

250
00:17:14,461 --> 00:17:15,294
morals.

251
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:20,300
The good people tried to train me to be
good and the bad people did train me to

252
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:21,134
be bad.

253
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,270
Yeah.

254
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:26,290
The method that the good people used in
training was to beat goodness into me

255
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,530
and all the badness out of me.
They'd done their best,

256
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:32,710
but their best wasn't good enough to
accomplish what they set out to do.

257
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,380
The more they beat me and whipped me,

258
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:39,370
the more I hated them and
they're damn religion.

259
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,680
Oh yes. We had plenty of
church and religion. All right.

260
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,130
I used to be pretty ignorant
and not able to read very well,

261
00:17:48,131 --> 00:17:52,950
so I was always had a hard job learning
my Sunday school lessons for failure to

262
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:57,840
learn these lessons. I was
given a whipping during
the first year I was there.

263
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,650
I used to get a beating every Saturday
night and sometimes three or four more

264
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:05,700
during the week for doing something I
wasn't supposed to do or for not doing

265
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:10,230
something I was supposed to do.
Oh yes. I had plenty of abuse.

266
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,040
They had various methods of punishing us
for doing wrong and for teaching us to

267
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:14,874
do right.

268
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,290
The most popular with them was
to take us to the paint shop,

269
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:23,850
so called because there they used
to paint our bodies black and blue.

270
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,160
Naturally. I now love
Jesus very much, much.

271
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:31,881
Yes.

272
00:18:31,881 --> 00:18:36,770
I love him so damn much that I would
like to crucify him all over again.

273
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:40,803
Yeah.

274
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,110
I was too dumb to learn
anything in school,

275
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:46,380
so they took me out and put me to work
all day washing dishes and waiting on

276
00:18:46,381 --> 00:18:48,840
tables and the officer's
dining room right there.

277
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:53,130
I began to get a little revenge on those
who abused me when I served some food

278
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:56,430
to the some of the officers I
used to urinate in their soup,

279
00:18:56,431 --> 00:19:00,000
coffee or tea and masturbate into their
ice cream or dessert and then stand

280
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:01,920
right beside them and watch them eat it.

281
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,870
They enjoyed it too because they told
me so. I wish they could read this. Now

282
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,190
the next thing I tried to do as poison
that Mr John more by putting rat poison

283
00:19:16,191 --> 00:19:20,180
in his rights, rice
pudding, but they caught me,

284
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,670
beat me,
and put me out of the dining room.

285
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:29,650
About that time I began to try and
figure out some way to punish those who

286
00:19:29,651 --> 00:19:30,484
punished me.

287
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,500
The only thing I could figure out was
to burn down the building in which the

288
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:37,900
paint shop was located.
This I did

289
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,520
okay.

290
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,181
I've got a long,

291
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:44,320
thick piece of heavy cotton string
wrapped it around and around a long round

292
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:49,321
stick and lit what end of it and hit it
in the laundry near some oil soaked rags

293
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:50,921
that night.

294
00:19:50,921 --> 00:19:54,340
The whole place burned down in a cost
of a hundred over a hundred thousand

295
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,173
dollars Nicei

296
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:02,570
some of the boys who were clever than
I finally put me wise to how I should

297
00:20:02,571 --> 00:20:05,090
perform.
If I ever wanted to get out of that joint.

298
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,150
They told me to act like
I was a very good boy.

299
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:12,410
Tell everybody I met how much I love
Jesus and how I wanted to go home and be a

300
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:15,350
good boy.
Go to school and learn to be a preacher.

301
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,660
Okay.

302
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:22,460
I done just as they suggested and I'm
damned if it didn't work out just as slick

303
00:20:22,461 --> 00:20:24,190
as hot grease through a tin horn.

304
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:25,660
Yeah.

305
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,380
I was called in before the parole board
one day and there I told them all the

306
00:20:29,381 --> 00:20:33,670
lies and hot air I could and they
gave me a parole and let me go home.

307
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:36,940
In that way,

308
00:20:36,941 --> 00:20:41,941
I first found out how to use religion
as a cloak of hypocrisy to cover up my

309
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:44,560
rascality.
He's

310
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,453
okay.

311
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:56,100
Rough way to kick things off.
Yeah. But you almost like,

312
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,450
you know, you talk about like evil,
you almost feel it for him though,

313
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,680
are on his side, kind of like, yeah.

314
00:21:03,681 --> 00:21:06,940
It won't just beating you up your whole
life making just grinding into I'm

315
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,330
beating you up. And then
like, yes, you're getting it.

316
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,440
That's how you feel right now.

317
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:15,080
Yeah. Well it's, it's one of
those things that's going to be,

318
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,750
you know,
yeah.

319
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:21,830
You feel sympathetic for
someone and then you as,

320
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,080
as that person moves through
life, first of all, it's,

321
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:29,120
there's other people that had been through
worse things that turn out great and

322
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,670
wonderful human beings.

323
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,350
And there's other people that go through
last that turned out worse. Right.

324
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:41,150
So there's, it's, it's,
uh, I'm no psychologists,

325
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,490
but there's,
there's,

326
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,030
it's one of the things
that's troubling about this

327
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,880
and as you,

328
00:21:49,881 --> 00:21:54,470
as you hear what he goes through
and when he turns into it's,

329
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:59,780
yeah, it's, it's definitely
a challenge. And you know,

330
00:21:59,781 --> 00:22:03,110
at the end of the day in,
in my opinion, like, hey,

331
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:07,010
you're still responsible
for your actions and hey,

332
00:22:07,011 --> 00:22:09,140
we get it that you went
through some hard things

333
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,830
that doesn't give you an excuse
to behave in an immoral way.

334
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:16,723
It just doesn't.

335
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,730
Yeah, it doesn't, I'm sure
that, um, you know, like he,

336
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:25,920
he was saying how he was,
you know, pissing in the soup
and whatnot. I mean, I'm,

337
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,240
I'm assuming those of the people who
were like trying to correct them and you

338
00:22:30,241 --> 00:22:33,300
know, I'm beating him on
staff, the staff of the,

339
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,280
of the school where he
was being trained at.

340
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,640
So I think that's sort of why you're like
kind of feeling for them because it's

341
00:22:41,161 --> 00:22:41,581
like,
oh yeah,

342
00:22:41,581 --> 00:22:44,490
you're getting direct revenge on that
kind of thing and you're of course you're

343
00:22:44,491 --> 00:22:48,030
angry kid. Yeah, of course. What
you went through. But then yeah,

344
00:22:48,031 --> 00:22:51,030
once you start just taking it out like,
oh, let me see an innocent person,

345
00:22:51,031 --> 00:22:53,990
I'm mad at them because their life is,
and then you kill him or something,

346
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,540
then that's when you're going to
start to not feel for them. I'm sure.

347
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,870
I think. Yeah, I think so too. Yeah.

348
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,390
I guess you do get that kind of feeling
like all these guys are beating you up

349
00:23:05,391 --> 00:23:07,610
now you're getting a little revenge.
You could,

350
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,800
you could make a positive
movie about that. Right?

351
00:23:09,801 --> 00:23:12,560
You could make a positive story that
you can spin it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

352
00:23:12,561 --> 00:23:16,070
depending on where it goes from there.
So right now you're,

353
00:23:16,071 --> 00:23:18,830
you're on his side basically

354
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,490
basic and back to the book,
after serving about two years there,

355
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:28,430
I was pronounced by the Parole
Board to be a nice, clean boy.

356
00:23:28,431 --> 00:23:32,110
Have good morals as pure as a lily and
a credit to those in authority in the,

357
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:37,070
in the instruction where I had been sent
to be reformed. Yes, sure. I was reformed.

358
00:23:37,071 --> 00:23:41,420
All right. Damn good. And reform
too. When I got out of there,

359
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:46,100
I knew all about Jesus and the Bible so
much so that I knew it was a lot of hot

360
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:46,934
air.

361
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:47,830
Okay.

362
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,930
But that wasn't all I knew.

363
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,540
I had been taught by Christians
how to be a hypocrite.

364
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:52,690
Okay.

365
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:57,550
And I had learned about stealing,
lying, hating, burning, and killing

366
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,730
from the treatment I received while
there and the lessons I learned from it.

367
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,810
I had fully decided when I left there,
just how I would live my life.

368
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,470
I made up my mind that I would rob burn,
destroy,

369
00:24:10,471 --> 00:24:14,430
and kill everywhere I went and
everybody as long as I lived.

370
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,200
That's the way I was reformed in
the Minnesota state training school.

371
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,700
That's the reason why,

372
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,690
so that's a little bit more that that's,

373
00:24:25,691 --> 00:24:28,870
that's where you have something
in his, in his personality, right.

374
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,733
There's something,

375
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,040
there's plenty of people that went to
this school that didn't go do what he did.

376
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:35,710
He made that stair something snapped.
Yeah.

377
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:41,140
Where he decided that he was just going
to make his life a life of making people

378
00:24:41,141 --> 00:24:41,974
suffer.

379
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,580
Going on back to the book,
I did not want to learn these lessons,

380
00:24:49,581 --> 00:24:54,500
but I found out that it isn't what
one wants in this world. That one gets

381
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:01,760
force and might make. Right. Perhaps
things shouldn't be that way,

382
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:03,080
but that's the way they are.

383
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,860
I learned to look with suspicion
and hatred on everybody.

384
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:07,960
Okay.

385
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,650
As the years went on, that persisted
in my mind. That persisted.

386
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:14,530
That idea persisted in my mind.
Above all others.

387
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:18,160
I figured that if I was strong enough
and clever enough to impose my will on

388
00:25:18,161 --> 00:25:19,420
others,
I was right.

389
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,620
Yeah.

390
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,210
I still believe that to this day.

391
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:25,973
Yeah.

392
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:30,640
So this is just this twisted. Yeah, it's
really, it doesn't take long for him.

393
00:25:30,641 --> 00:25:31,474
They get pretty twisted.

394
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,913
Okay.

395
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:36,570
In like there's a lesson here of
who the lesson that he talks about.

396
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:40,300
If I found out that it isn't in the,
what one wants in a world that one gets,

397
00:25:40,301 --> 00:25:41,860
it's like that's actually
an important lesson.

398
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:46,570
Like you don't always get what you
want, but then taking that to say, Hey,

399
00:25:46,571 --> 00:25:49,900
if I'm strong enough and I
can force my will on things,

400
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,990
then I'll get what I want more often.

401
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,850
Yeah. And the in that he did
say clever enough to, yeah.

402
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,660
Which kind of,
it's weird cause like a real low,

403
00:26:00,661 --> 00:26:03,450
super low level of that
still goes on I think with,

404
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:07,080
with a lot of people there,
no doubt about it. You know,

405
00:26:07,081 --> 00:26:11,580
with justification and you know how
like, you know, you'll, you know, you'll,

406
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:15,840
you'll justify things in your head,
you know, it'd be like, Oh, you know,

407
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,560
when you do something bad, will you
do something, you know, is unfair.

408
00:26:19,561 --> 00:26:22,650
Even that kind of low level stuff,
like it's not hurting no bunch for sure,

409
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,380
but it's like maybe not
fair or something like that.

410
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,040
Then you'd just justify in your head.
And you know,

411
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,820
like some people they're clever.

412
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:34,590
Like they're smart so they can justify
their justifications are way more legit

413
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,280
seeming. Cause they're real smart.
They can just, you know, yeah.

414
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,840
It's kind of like with lawyers, you see
the lawyers doing the movie, you know,

415
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,530
you paint for someone to
be like someone like the,

416
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,360
you kind of take things out of context
and put other things in context and not

417
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:49,650
supposed to be there kind of thing.
And Yeah,

418
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:52,950
you just kind of paint this picture in
your own mind why what you're doing is

419
00:26:52,951 --> 00:26:54,960
right. And of course in other
people's mind too, you know,

420
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:59,400
then you're clever enough, Daniel,
you're justifying it yourself and he's,

421
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:02,990
but he's not even talking about that.
He doesn't need to justify it to himself.

422
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:06,300
He's doing what he's doing to,
to get what he wants.

423
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:12,050
And his use of being clever
isn't to justify to himself
his use of being clever.

424
00:27:12,091 --> 00:27:14,930
It's just to outwit people and
take advantage of them. Yeah.

425
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,260
Be a con man beyond a con man.
And he gets,

426
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:23,200
so he's in and out of prison and he goes
back into prison. He gets out of prison.

427
00:27:23,201 --> 00:27:26,280
He goes back into present here. At this
point, he broke out of prison and he's,

428
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:29,610
he hooks up with a guy named Jimmy Benson.
Back to the book.

429
00:27:29,611 --> 00:27:34,050
He showed me how to work the stickup
racket and how to rob the poor boxes in

430
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:38,910
churches. I in turn taught him how to
set fire to a church after we robbed it.

431
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:44,460
We got very busy on that robbing and
burning or church regular every chance we

432
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:45,294
got.

433
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:46,700
Yeah.

434
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,290
When we got tired of riding a train
because this is their, their uh, you know,

435
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,390
hitching on these trains.
When we got tired of riding on a train,

436
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,250
we used to open up the journal boxes,

437
00:27:55,251 --> 00:27:59,690
take out the greasy waste packing and
throw in some sand or gravel into it.

438
00:27:59,691 --> 00:28:01,550
They wouldn't get far with that car.

439
00:28:01,551 --> 00:28:05,740
So they get done riding a train and
they just destroy it. They, you know,

440
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,560
they ruin the gearboxes.
Just general destruction of everything

441
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,100
continues in and out of prison.

442
00:28:13,101 --> 00:28:18,101
One time he uses drunk and here's a
guy talking about the army and ends up

443
00:28:18,591 --> 00:28:20,690
enlisting in the army.
Back to the book.

444
00:28:20,691 --> 00:28:25,190
I was only in the army a month or two
when I got three years in u s military

445
00:28:25,191 --> 00:28:27,620
prison at Fort Leavenworth,
Kansas.

446
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:32,570
I had the job of swinging 18
pound hammer in the rock quarry.

447
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,620
Most of my bit,

448
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:38,950
my number was 1874 and my
name was Karl Pans Ram there.

449
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:41,030
I done 37 months.

450
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:44,660
I done plenty of work and I had plenty
of punishment and the only good part of

451
00:28:44,661 --> 00:28:46,980
it was that they didn't try
to hammer anymore religion.

452
00:28:46,981 --> 00:28:50,600
And to me at this time of my life,
I was about 20 years old,

453
00:28:50,601 --> 00:28:55,601
six foot tall and weighed about 190
pound of concentrated hell fired man

454
00:28:55,641 --> 00:29:00,590
inspired meanness.
I was strong as two or three average men.

455
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,600
Yeah.

456
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,840
I had to be to be able to withstand
some of the punishments and labor that I

457
00:29:05,841 --> 00:29:09,880
went through during my
three years in the u s um,

458
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,120
military prison.

459
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,430
One of my tasks and punishments while
there was to be shackled to a 50 pound

460
00:29:18,431 --> 00:29:21,010
iron ball for six months.
During that time,

461
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:22,660
I wore the ball and chain day and night,

462
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:26,440
slept with it and work with it on my
work was in the rock quarry and that was

463
00:29:26,441 --> 00:29:27,700
three miles from the prison.

464
00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:31,750
The gang of about 300 convicts and 40
screws used to march out in the morning

465
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:35,170
and back at night. The other men had
to carry nothing except themselves.

466
00:29:35,171 --> 00:29:39,730
But my part was to load my iron ball,
an 18 pound hammer, a pick and shovel,

467
00:29:39,731 --> 00:29:44,440
and a six foot iron crowbar all into a
wheel barrow and march behind the line of

468
00:29:44,441 --> 00:29:48,400
cons out to the Corey and worked there
for eight and a half hours in the hot

469
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:51,070
Kansas son busting big rocks,

470
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:58,300
but all of that treatment did one
good thing for me. The worst food was,

471
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,540
and the harbor,
they worked me the stronger I got,

472
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:07,120
I was going to save the, Oh, so he got
a good workout and you think, yeah,

473
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:10,750
he's six feet tall, 190
pounds back in, what is it,

474
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:12,160
1900 or whatever.

475
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:17,190
He's a yolks dude and he's doing all
this hardcore physical labor and yeah,

476
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:22,900
he's turning into a very scary dude.

477
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,343
Hmm.

478
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:29,150
Back to the book. I was discharged
from prison in 1910 by the way,

479
00:30:29,151 --> 00:30:29,691
can you imagine?

480
00:30:29,691 --> 00:30:33,440
You're in the army for a couple months
and you get put in the Leavenworth for

481
00:30:33,441 --> 00:30:34,490
three years.

482
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,550
I was the spirit of meanness personified.

483
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,390
I had not at this time got
so that I hated myself.

484
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:50,080
I only hated everybody
else before I left there.

485
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:54,700
I Sung on the same old song and gave
him the same line about how I sure love

486
00:30:54,701 --> 00:30:59,650
Jesus and what a nice young man I was
and how much good I it had done me to be

487
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:02,650
sent to that prison.
I don't know if they believe me or not,

488
00:31:02,651 --> 00:31:04,150
but they all said they did anyway.

489
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,050
They all declared that I was pure
as a Lilly and free from sin.

490
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:15,060
Again, there are so a bunch of
traveling, there's a bunch of coffee.

491
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,620
He's a constant criminal and he,

492
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:21,100
there's another thing we realize back
in this day and the reason he named,

493
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,090
he said,
oh,

494
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,990
at this time I was Carl Pans
Ram is because he changes
his name a bunch because

495
00:31:25,991 --> 00:31:30,400
that's what just what you would do back
then if you a criminal and there's no

496
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,730
electronic tracking system, there's
no phone numbers, no cell phone.

497
00:31:33,731 --> 00:31:37,720
There's not even a fault with like phones
and everyone's houses so you can get

498
00:31:37,721 --> 00:31:42,420
away with murder quite literally.
And he does, but he, he,

499
00:31:42,421 --> 00:31:46,650
he's maybe not the best criminal as well
because he gets caught a lot, you know,

500
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,910
for robbing and stealing and part
of it's cause cause he has like a,

501
00:31:48,911 --> 00:31:52,550
doesn't care it,
so he gets put,

502
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,100
he gets arrested at different time.

503
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:59,101
He gets put into a chain gang and he
eventually breaks away from escapes the

504
00:32:01,631 --> 00:32:06,631
chain gang and then he goes
from continuing skipping
trains and ends up with an

505
00:32:07,181 --> 00:32:12,181
Indian guy and they work together as a
little team and they rob a guy and here

506
00:32:13,421 --> 00:32:17,350
we go back to the book of the Indian,
tied him up first he took off his belt,

507
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:20,500
pulled his pants down to below his
knees and tied his legs together.

508
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:24,820
Then he tied his hands behind his back.
Then he tied his hands to his feet,

509
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:25,720
pulled together.

510
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,700
Then he stuffed a sock in his mouth and
tied a handkerchief tied over that and

511
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:35,220
then tied them to a tree. He was in
ready to leave him and walk away.

512
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:36,360
But I wasn't through yet.

513
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:41,360
I figured while I had such a good chances
that I would commit a little sodomy on

514
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:45,390
him.
This I proceeded to do

515
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,080
and he mentioned at one point that he,

516
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:56,110
he hooked up with a girl and got
some kind of vd and then he was like,

517
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,250
oh girls, they're dirty. And so
that's why he goes after guys. Now

518
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:08,740
back to the book at at night,
while I was riding the freight trains,

519
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:14,520
I was always on the lookout for something
to shoot or trying to stick up the

520
00:33:14,561 --> 00:33:16,330
Hobos that I met on the trains.

521
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:20,440
I looked them all over and whenever I
met one who wasn't too rusty looking,

522
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:23,440
I would make him raises
hands and drop his pants.

523
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:28,570
I wasn't very particular either.
I rode them old and young,

524
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,100
tall and short, white and black.
It made no difference to me.

525
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:36,903
Yeah.

526
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:41,650
Some months later I was pinched
at Chinook Montana for burglary.

527
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:48,660
I quick took a plea of guilty and got one
year at the state prison at deer lodge,

528
00:33:48,661 --> 00:33:53,460
Montana. When I got there, I met
my old partner, Jimmy Benson,

529
00:33:53,461 --> 00:33:55,110
who was doing 10 years for robbery.

530
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,790
I stayed there about eight
months in escaped he,

531
00:33:57,791 --> 00:34:00,570
he's also good at escaping escapes
all these things all the time.

532
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,360
A week later I was
arrested in three forks,

533
00:34:03,361 --> 00:34:06,600
Montana for burglary under
the name of Jeff Rhodes.

534
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:10,860
I pleaded guilty and got a year and was
sent back to deer lodge where I was at

535
00:34:10,861 --> 00:34:11,191
once,

536
00:34:11,191 --> 00:34:14,910
brought to court and given one year for
my escape under the name Jeff Davis.

537
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:19,890
Out of these three sentences,
I served 23 months in that prison.

538
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:23,820
There was only work for a few
men and I wasn't one of those.

539
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:27,090
All the cells were for
two men in each cell.

540
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:31,650
Each man could choose his own cell mates
and get a new one anytime he wanted.

541
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:36,780
I used to want a new one pretty regular
at that place and time I got to be an

542
00:34:36,781 --> 00:34:38,220
experienced wolf.

543
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:44,220
I knew more about sodomy than old boy
Oscar Wilde ever thought of knowing.

544
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,700
I would start in the morning with sodomy,
work as hard as,

545
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:52,290
as hard at it as I could all day
and sometimes half the night.

546
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:57,530
I was so busy committing sodomy that I
didn't have time left to serve Jesus as I

547
00:34:58,201 --> 00:35:00,780
had been taught to in
those reforms schools.

548
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,170
He gets out of that prison.

549
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:10,320
As soon as I got to Oregon and gets
put in another prison, I got to,

550
00:35:10,321 --> 00:35:12,780
as soon as I got to Oregon State prison,
I was in more trouble.

551
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:18,030
I swore I would never do the seven
years and defied the warden and all his

552
00:35:18,031 --> 00:35:22,320
officers to make me gets put in
solitary confinement. Here we go.

553
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:25,140
In solitary confinement,
there are coolers and coolers.

554
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,580
Some are bad and some are worse.
None are good. Some are cold and wet,

555
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,840
some are hot and dry.

556
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:35,880
Some you freeze and others you roast and
sweat in all you are hungry and thirsty

557
00:35:35,881 --> 00:35:40,881
and filthy and in some you stay a day
or there's a week and there have been

558
00:35:41,161 --> 00:35:43,380
times when I've been in
the cooler a month or more.

559
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:48,150
Bread and water isn't very nourishing
and neither does it generate clean

560
00:35:48,151 --> 00:35:49,800
thinking in a person's mind.

561
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:54,750
The milk of human kindness generally
curdles and turns into sour under such

562
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:57,630
conditions.
The more cooler you get,

563
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,420
the more heat and hate
there is in your heart.

564
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,710
In every joint I was ever in,

565
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:06,650
there was always some form
of torture that was on tap.

566
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:10,190
I usually got my share
of every kind there was.

567
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:15,550
I've had them all at one time or another
and then he goes on through a bunch of

568
00:36:15,801 --> 00:36:16,634
different

569
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:24,020
torture that they would use on these
prisoners from like straight jacket type

570
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:27,480
things. There's something
called the snorting Pole,

571
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:32,670
which is a post about 12 feet long. You
get basically tied to it. You get whipped

572
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:38,680
back to the book. When the lash begins
to take away, little bits of hide in,

573
00:36:38,681 --> 00:36:43,270
the blood begins to run. Then the soccer
begins to jerk and Yelp and snort.

574
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,190
That's why it's called the snorting pole.

575
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,280
When a man is let down
after being whipped,

576
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:54,120
he has blood on his back
and murder in his heart.

577
00:36:56,090 --> 00:37:00,320
That's, that's all about
the snorting Paul. There's a
bat and the paddle, there's,

578
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:05,360
here's this thing, the restraint
machine, the restraint machine,

579
00:37:05,361 --> 00:37:08,300
bare footed,
standing on a cold damp concrete floor,

580
00:37:08,301 --> 00:37:12,260
backed up to an iron bar door,
hands behind, cuffed to the door,

581
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,190
a large belt under my arms, around
my chest, pulled tight to the door,

582
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,290
standing in that position for four hours,

583
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:20,570
then let down for one hour
to eat my bread and water.

584
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,990
Then four hours more than to bed,
which was a board,

585
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:27,800
no blankets in the morning,
bread and water,

586
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:32,270
and then four hours more and so on for
a stretch of anywhere from five to 14

587
00:37:32,271 --> 00:37:33,920
days.
That was the limit.

588
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:38,780
That's your restraint machine you've ever,
okay.

589
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:42,830
I know you're claustrophobic,
right? Sure. Yeah. I mean you are,

590
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,120
but sometimes I don't.
I don't think I'm claustrophobic,

591
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:50,690
but sometimes I want to
move a limb. Right. You know
what I'm saying? Well, yeah,

592
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,850
and for instance,

593
00:37:52,851 --> 00:37:57,851
you're on a plane and you're all tight
and in economy seat up against the

594
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:03,320
bulkhead and there's
like, it's tight. Yeah.

595
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:07,070
You know that part of the plane
towards the back where the, the, the,

596
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:11,420
the bulkhead kind of curves in. So you're
even losing a little bit more space.

597
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:14,750
Yeah. And you just want
to move. Yeah. You know,

598
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,640
but you can't cause the seatbelt
light just went on. Yes.

599
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:23,960
Now imagine doing four hours like
that for 14 days. Four hours.

600
00:38:23,961 --> 00:38:28,940
Twice a day for 14 days.
Yeah. That's horse shit. Yeah.
That's actually real harsh.

601
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:34,280
So there's like two and t to Sam Club.
Cause claustrophobia usually is like,

602
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,070
you know Lee,

603
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,680
you go in an elevator and you feel
it. That kind of, you know, I don't,

604
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:41,650
I don't have it like that,
but yeah,

605
00:38:41,651 --> 00:38:46,510
maybe I'm a little bit more sensitive to
those kinds of scenarios. Side control,

606
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,420
claustrophobia. Well
you know I used to, yes.

607
00:38:49,421 --> 00:38:54,400
But this is more what it
is to put accurately. Did I
email you? Healed me? Yeah.

608
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:59,590
Actually what it was. So it's like he,
I just got in better shape. That's all.

609
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,630
Cause like it wasn't,

610
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,900
it was the idea that if I'm like tired
and I won't be able to get out of here,

611
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,590
like I'm stuck here forever, I'm going
to die here. That's the feeling you get.

612
00:39:08,591 --> 00:39:11,730
But when I wasn't tired, I'm like, oh
no, I can cruise down here. I just,

613
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:14,320
I don't know.
It just felt like it was better

614
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,300
the last time we rolled.
Didn't you have a little issue down there?

615
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,970
No. Are you sure? Yes.

616
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:25,130
I don't remember having any
issue recently. Probably
like year. It's been years,

617
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,220
but that's the feeling is what
it is. So, but here's the,

618
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,230
when I got an MRI on my arm,
you tap to something the other day.

619
00:39:33,231 --> 00:39:37,010
That's not a tapping offense.
I forget what it was.

620
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:43,040
It was your that that forum
on my throat. Oh, I remember.

621
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,530
It was like I couldn't,

622
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:50,270
it was too like you did it too hard for
me to have time to figure out, okay,

623
00:39:50,271 --> 00:39:53,510
I can turn this way or what a to
relieve the pain. You did it too fast.

624
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,320
I did it with like a little
extra, like a little, yeah.

625
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,460
It wasn't like a striker or
nothing like that. But yeah,

626
00:39:58,461 --> 00:40:01,370
it was like I would've gotten, my
throat would have got injured if I will.

627
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,720
Took more time. Thanks
for that. By the way,

628
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,330
I had a MRI on my, Oh, you're
selling that tube. Yeah.

629
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:14,120
So which is fine if you're
just in a comfortable position.

630
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:18,920
It can be when you open your eyes
and you look how freaking tube is,

631
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,430
like inches in front of your
face and you're in there. Yeah,

632
00:40:22,431 --> 00:40:25,460
I can kind of Jammy all,
but you just close your eyes
and be like, oh, that'll be,

633
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,560
claustrophobia is a big deal in the,

634
00:40:27,561 --> 00:40:32,561
in the seal teams especially cause you
had to lock out of the sub submarine

635
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,660
chambers,
which isn't in the old days,

636
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:40,010
it was a submarine chamber that
wasn't built for seals to lock out of.

637
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,140
It was built for an escape hatch.

638
00:40:42,141 --> 00:40:44,630
If there's an emergency
on the submarine lockout,

639
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,320
you're underwater in a submarine.
Yeah.

640
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,540
And you go into a little chamber and
then once you're in a little chamber,

641
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,770
it fills with water,

642
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,720
equalize to the outside and then the
door opens up and you can swim out.

643
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,660
That's called the lockout chamber. And
we used to do that and uh, there's still,

644
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,381
we still do it,

645
00:41:00,381 --> 00:41:02,960
but like it's a little bit more of a
specialized group that does that now.

646
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:06,670
But it used to just be a general thing
for good for if you were in the day and

647
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:07,623
he would do that.

648
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:13,300
And I mean it can definitely cause
you're in there with equipment as long a

649
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:19,070
while it would take a long time to get
ahold of seal squad out. Like what?

650
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:23,290
Like what's a wild boy? You'd be,
you'd be in that little chamber, uh,

651
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:28,400
for probably 15 minutes at a time.
But here's the thing, you're in there,

652
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:31,820
there's two major situations going on.
Number one, you're not just in there,

653
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:34,100
you're in there with like
one or two other guys. Yeah.

654
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,790
But you're also sitting there with
equipment, so got bags of weapons,

655
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:41,750
waterproof weapons. You actually
have your boats in there and there.

656
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:44,670
So it's all tight and here's,
here's what would really freak out.

657
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:49,400
So the water starts to fill,
it starts to fill up,

658
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,740
and then as it's filling up,

659
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:55,250
it gets to a point where
you got to keep it equal as,

660
00:41:55,251 --> 00:41:57,860
and you're using these
little pressure valves. One,

661
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:01,160
you basically crank a valve that
pushes air into the chamber,

662
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:06,200
and so that pushes the water down.
If you're not good,

663
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,080
then you're going to mess up the pressure.

664
00:42:09,081 --> 00:42:12,290
And it's called losing the bubble cause
there's a bubble of air that you're just

665
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:15,740
sitting there breathing.
If you don't equalize the pressure,

666
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:20,570
well then that bubble of just keeps
going up and then you lose the bubble.

667
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:21,404
The bubble is gone,

668
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:26,300
which I think is where the w that's what
I always thought. Losing the bubble.

669
00:42:26,301 --> 00:42:28,850
And you've heard that term, right?
No. Okay. When someone says, oh,

670
00:42:28,851 --> 00:42:32,390
he's losing the bubble. You've never
heard that before? No. Well, we would say,

671
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:36,050
and I've heard it, I've heard a civilian
say it too, so I'm pretty sure that it's,

672
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,750
yeah, but I think that that's
where it came from. It's like, Oh,

673
00:42:38,751 --> 00:42:39,501
you're losing the bubble.

674
00:42:39,501 --> 00:42:44,501
And I've been in the chamber when someone
lost the bubble and I remember I was

675
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,630
telling the guy, I was like,
Hey, you're losing the bubble,

676
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:50,090
you're losing the bubble. He wasn't
about, and then I'm underwater.

677
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,330
And then you've got to find the,
you've got to find the octopus,

678
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:57,650
which is the regulator of which you have,
you have air tanks just in there,

679
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:58,820
like compressed air tanks,

680
00:42:58,821 --> 00:43:02,780
like scuba tanks that are strapped to
the wall just in case someone loses the

681
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:04,370
bubble.
But did you got to find,

682
00:43:04,371 --> 00:43:06,560
they've got a chem light on a
red cam lights and you just dig,

683
00:43:06,561 --> 00:43:08,960
dig around and go and grab the red cow.
Might you find your thing,

684
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:12,470
you start breathing and you find the
valve and you crank it and then the bubble

685
00:43:12,471 --> 00:43:16,550
comes back. But yeah, you,

686
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,480
if you're claustrophobic in that situation
is going to be problematic. Big. Huge.

687
00:43:20,481 --> 00:43:23,270
Yeah. Cause it's just the expression
on your face at this time.

688
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:26,360
She tells me that you would not, how
big was it? How big is the chambers?

689
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:31,220
It's smaller than the area that
you and I are sitting, right? Yeah.

690
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:35,930
Yeah. So my Mri for my
Bicep, I had to go like this,

691
00:43:35,931 --> 00:43:38,810
like my hand up in the air.
Well you know,

692
00:43:38,811 --> 00:43:41,990
I'm laying down so it's not up in the
air, but like, so you're not laying,

693
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:45,260
laying regular, one hand is up. Okay.

694
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,980
And for 15 minutes in that
little teeny tiny tube,

695
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:53,000
like how you're saying I
could lay on my bed like that.

696
00:43:53,001 --> 00:43:55,770
They sedate you or anything.
You just dealt with it? Yeah.

697
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:59,780
This is how had a few Mris in my time,
but I just relaxed her, went in there,

698
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:03,470
no big deal. I didn't lose the bubble. I
do. No, no, no, no. The thing is I did it.

699
00:44:03,471 --> 00:44:06,660
Well, here's the thing. So this is
what I really admitted to myself. Okay.

700
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,360
I have like a little, um,
sensitivity to it. Um, he's like,

701
00:44:11,361 --> 00:44:14,900
okay, you got to put your arm up cause
it, you know, and you can't move.

702
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,750
So I'm thinking, man, I can just
lay it on my bed like this all day.

703
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:18,970
I'll sleep like that,
you know,

704
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:23,120
but why am I super like
nervous about this?

705
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:26,990
So I go in and he's putting me in and I
feel my heart just started beating real

706
00:44:26,991 --> 00:44:31,500
fast, like full on. I'm
like, oh man. But um,

707
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:36,270
but I mentally push through it like the
kind of, I feel like not even a minute,

708
00:44:36,271 --> 00:44:39,090
but maybe like 30, 45 seconds.
I'm like, ah, you know,

709
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:45,600
watch guys cave diving.
Like what do you mean?

710
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:49,890
No? Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. We're done underwater.
But it's an underwater cave.

711
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:54,180
Yeah. And you're diving that can
get a little tight. Yeah. So, and I,

712
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,850
we um,
I'm quiet.

713
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:01,950
It was a place called the blue room
and it's that, and here's the thing.

714
00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:06,030
So it's basically a cave. You walk up this
mountain maybe like, I don't know, 50,

715
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:11,030
50 yards, maybe up a mountain.
And you go, well, no,

716
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,170
no, the mountain is huge. You just
walked up 50 hours. Then there's a cake.

717
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,640
That's where the cave is and you're going
in the cave and depending on, you know,

718
00:45:17,641 --> 00:45:20,880
how much it rained or whatever, there's
a little lake in the caves. Really cool.

719
00:45:20,881 --> 00:45:24,660
We used to always go at the back of
the cave is a little teeny tiny hole,

720
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,580
teeny tiny pool. If the water's
too high and it covers that whole,

721
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:31,500
it's still a hole, but it's,
you got to go under water.

722
00:45:31,501 --> 00:45:32,820
So at the end of that it basically,

723
00:45:32,821 --> 00:45:35,640
that whole is a hallway that you swim
through. You can't touch the bottom.

724
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:39,090
It's like you swim through this little
hallway and it goes and it curves.

725
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:44,510
This is maybe maybe a 2020
yards day and not 20 that's,

726
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,470
that's you know, maybe
10 in the dark though.

727
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:52,860
And the only light is glowing,

728
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:56,700
bright blue light that the water creates
from the sun that shines in the water

729
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:00,990
and kind of reflects up. It's
really, it's really nice. But yeah,

730
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:04,890
if you have an issue with that,
especially if the other side, what do you,

731
00:46:04,891 --> 00:46:08,520
it's a big room it now that's
another thing. Open to the light.

732
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:13,410
The light from the water
lights up the room. So it's,
it's, yeah, it's really weird.

733
00:46:13,411 --> 00:46:15,780
That's why you kind of go cause
it's really awesome. The thing is,

734
00:46:15,781 --> 00:46:19,920
there's nothing to hold on
to your treading water in
that room. So it's like, oh,

735
00:46:19,921 --> 00:46:23,550
the rum room is deep water. Yeah. You
get in touch. It's a huge lake in there,

736
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:26,460
you know, so you can't touch
the bottom at all. And um,

737
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:30,710
but if the water level is high
enough where that cave or the,

738
00:46:30,711 --> 00:46:35,220
the hallway we'll call it, it's like this,
you know, where you can just barely to,

739
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:38,400
it gets like, oh, this is kind
of nerve wracking for sure.

740
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,010
But sometimes it's real low and
it's cool you just swim through.

741
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,880
But if it's like your first time or you
have a little bit of Claustrophobia in

742
00:46:44,881 --> 00:46:47,850
water like that, you'll,
it'll jam you up for sure.

743
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,660
But I never had a problem with Alan.
It's that,

744
00:46:51,661 --> 00:46:55,830
it's what you said when you
know you can't move. Yeah.

745
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,890
But if you know you can move so you
can just stay there. It's weird.

746
00:46:58,891 --> 00:47:01,120
It's like a psychological
thing, you know? Yeah, no,

747
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,350
but yeah, it's, you know,

748
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:07,530
I get that every once in a while on
the plane to the restraint machine.

749
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:13,170
So I guess that would be really effective
against some people that have a little

750
00:47:14,071 --> 00:47:18,240
claustrophobia or they,
the thing is though,

751
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,140
okay, let's say all of these
methods are bad, right?

752
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:25,860
Let's say all these methods of reform are
bad. I feel good about saying that. Yes.

753
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:30,250
Okay. And then you say, okay, if I
was in that situation, I do everything

754
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:34,780
I could to get out of the scenario where
like okay I got arrested and I got put

755
00:47:34,781 --> 00:47:37,930
in there straight machine and I got the
beat with a paddle and I got all those

756
00:47:37,931 --> 00:47:38,571
things happen.
We get,

757
00:47:38,571 --> 00:47:42,370
so you know what I'm going to do is try
and trying to stay clean a little bit.

758
00:47:42,371 --> 00:47:47,340
Right. Get on, maybe get on a little bit
of a of a path. A better path. Yes sir.

759
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:52,780
It didn't work at all at
all. He didn't care. Yeah.

760
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:55,420
Well it kind of makes
sense that like when,

761
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:59,050
what did he say and went after the
snorting pole or whatever. Like Whoa,

762
00:47:59,051 --> 00:48:03,100
you just fill out the hatred and murder
in your mind. Yeah. That seems like,

763
00:48:03,101 --> 00:48:06,220
cause even the claustrophobia thing
on the, on the, what's that called,

764
00:48:06,221 --> 00:48:10,900
the restraints situation.
Four hours every like every session,

765
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:11,711
all day.
You know,

766
00:48:11,711 --> 00:48:15,700
like after awhile you're like you're
going to get used to that or you're going

767
00:48:15,701 --> 00:48:18,880
to go so nuts that you're just going to
faint or I dunno, something like that.

768
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:22,180
Either way there's a part of your
mind I would think. I don't know.

769
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:24,010
That's just what it feels
like listening to it.

770
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,620
I feel like I would just
be so nuts at the end.

771
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:29,890
Like oh like I wouldn't care
about that restraint thing.

772
00:48:29,891 --> 00:48:33,250
I would just care about like
murdering person or something.

773
00:48:33,251 --> 00:48:36,460
I could see how that could go. Yeah. I
mean I personally wouldn't go that way.

774
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,720
I'll probably try not to go there
anymore, but that's just me. Yeah.

775
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,760
So maybe as a reform or if you cross
the line and you make someone snap,

776
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:49,820
now you're no longer being productive.
This is true with your kids then.

777
00:48:49,821 --> 00:48:51,340
Maybe you haven't experienced this yet,

778
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:56,050
but you can like push your kids
to a point where they don't care.

779
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:58,330
Like yeah,
I'll take this away.

780
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:02,200
I'll take this away and then all of a
sudden they go, I don't care. Take it.

781
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:04,600
They throw their tour. You know
the tours that you're threatening,

782
00:49:04,601 --> 00:49:06,700
they throw it at you.
Take it,

783
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:11,320
remember the breakfast club.
Remember that movie? I do remember,

784
00:49:11,321 --> 00:49:14,890
I remember that Guy John Bender, what it
was Israel, I forget the actor's name,

785
00:49:14,891 --> 00:49:15,724
but anyway,

786
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,420
I'm just trying to play bender is his
name and he's like guys which carry the

787
00:49:19,421 --> 00:49:24,010
bad guy, the bad kid. Okay. And he's
really, and he's like, um, he's like, hey,

788
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:27,640
did Barry Manilow radio or did you
would read very mental. It was wardrobe.

789
00:49:27,641 --> 00:49:31,030
And he's like, I'll give you the answer
to that, uh, next Saturday saying like,

790
00:49:31,031 --> 00:49:34,390
you got another detention,
you're next day. And then,
then he says something else.

791
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:37,530
He goes, then you get another
Saturday. And he's like,
well, I'm free though. Soda.

792
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,440
You know, he did that. He was after,
I was like, I don't care. He's like,

793
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:45,670
and then he's holding up the horn,
two months vendor, I got two months.

794
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:51,130
Those good, a good part there. So
yes, you can't push it too far.

795
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:53,770
And obviously from a
leadership perspective,

796
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,810
we'll just go for a little
leadership perspectives here.

797
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:58,720
There are things you can do to the
people that work for you where they won't

798
00:49:58,721 --> 00:50:03,250
care anymore. Yeah, and
now you, now you're done.

799
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:07,120
You have, you've lost control.
You've lost control over them,

800
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:12,580
so don't do that.
He talks about this electric,

801
00:50:12,581 --> 00:50:15,430
electric shock to they
called the hummingbird first,

802
00:50:15,431 --> 00:50:20,140
an ordinary steel bathtub with in which
four or five inches of ice cold water.

803
00:50:20,141 --> 00:50:23,680
The victim is laid down in
there and chained hand and foot.

804
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:25,750
Then the chief torture enters the scene.

805
00:50:25,751 --> 00:50:28,100
He's dressed in ordinary
clothes and old and

806
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:32,390
has only a rubber slicker and a pair of
rubber gloves on his hands and his hands.

807
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:34,310
He holds a common sponge.

808
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,790
The sponge is connected to
electric battery by wires.

809
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:40,760
The switch is turned on and the
torture advances on the victim.

810
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:45,260
He first begins on the soles of the
feet by gently rubbing the charge sponge

811
00:50:45,261 --> 00:50:49,520
there and then gradually working his way
up to the body and to the head of the

812
00:50:49,521 --> 00:50:53,450
sensations of to the victim or that
there seems to be millions of red hot

813
00:50:53,451 --> 00:50:54,740
needles sticking into them.

814
00:50:55,670 --> 00:51:00,380
The agony is intense two or three minutes
and the victim is ready for the grave

815
00:51:00,381 --> 00:51:01,610
or the madhouse.

816
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,080
Yet there is not a single mark
or bruise on his whole body.

817
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,510
A physician stands beside this is sick.

818
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:13,310
The physician stands beside the victim
and every few seconds feels the pulse and

819
00:51:13,311 --> 00:51:14,210
examines him.

820
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:18,110
When he judges that the victim is
exactly on the verge of madness or death,

821
00:51:18,111 --> 00:51:22,130
he gives the signal to switch off the
current than the victim is thrown into a

822
00:51:22,131 --> 00:51:25,370
cell where he left for
a few days or weeks.

823
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:30,260
Yeah, that's weird. The sponge,

824
00:51:30,261 --> 00:51:35,261
how they put the sponge there
like on lethal weapon one he got,

825
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,600
he got rigs with that mirror
and I remember that's what
it made me think of when

826
00:51:42,021 --> 00:51:45,130
you had the, the sponges and he's in
the shower. I'll tie it up like that.

827
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:48,890
He keeps like hitting him. He hit
him again. Yeah, those sponges.

828
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:53,240
I wonder what that that's about though.
The sponge, it conducts electricity,

829
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:57,110
water,
water conducts the direct mark.

830
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:01,880
It's just hitting you with like
a big shock pillow of shock.

831
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:06,380
Uh, continues on. He gets it,

832
00:52:06,381 --> 00:52:10,910
eventually gets out of that prison and
any actually broke out of that prison.

833
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:15,260
And then he's now he's just
on like full crime mode.

834
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:19,970
I don't even know what goes beyond crime
mode, but just full stealing, raping,

835
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,560
murdering swindling.
He steals enough money.

836
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:28,790
He works on a bunch of different boats
and eventually steels enough money to buy

837
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:29,624
a yacht.

838
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:34,880
So he's bought a yacht and I
don't know how big the yacht was,

839
00:52:34,881 --> 00:52:35,750
but it wasn't small.

840
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:41,720
And here we go back to the look on my
yard. I had quarters for five people,

841
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,220
but I was alone for a while.

842
00:52:43,221 --> 00:52:46,580
Then I figured it would be a good plan
to hire a few sailors to work for me,

843
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,910
get them out on my yacht, get them
drunk, commits sodomy on them,

844
00:52:49,911 --> 00:52:54,620
robbed them and killed them.
This I done every day or two.

845
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,010
I would get plenty of blues,
booze by robbing other yachts there.

846
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:03,110
The Barbara too was one of them. I robbed
her. Does nurse, so others around there.

847
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,840
I was hitting the booze pretty
hard myself at that time.

848
00:53:05,841 --> 00:53:09,470
Every day or two I would go to New York
and hang around 25th street and size up

849
00:53:09,471 --> 00:53:10,220
the sailors.

850
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,280
Whenever I saw a couple of who were
about my size and seem to have money,

851
00:53:13,281 --> 00:53:14,840
I would hire them to work on my yacht.

852
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,630
I would always promise
them big pay and easy work.

853
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:20,420
What they got was something else.

854
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:25,470
I would take them and their clothes and
gear out to my yacht at city island.

855
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:29,280
There we would go and whine and dine and
when we, when they were drunk enough,

856
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:33,300
I would go to bed or they would go to bed.
When they were asleep,

857
00:53:33,301 --> 00:53:37,950
I would get my 45 Colt
automatic army pistol.

858
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:42,370
This I stole from Mr [inaudible]
House and blow their brains out.

859
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:47,800
Then it would take out a rope and tie a
rock on them and put them into my robot.

860
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:48,580
Rowboat,

861
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:52,510
rolled them out in the main channel
about one mile and drop him overboard.

862
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,690
They are there yet 10 of them.

863
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:59,260
I worked at racket for about three weeks.

864
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,060
We eventually gets on another ship,
loses that kind of gets

865
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:12,760
people are suspect. He goes, gets
on a ship to Europe from Europe.

866
00:54:12,761 --> 00:54:17,590
He goes to Africa in Africa.
He buys a girl.

867
00:54:17,591 --> 00:54:19,360
I paid a big price for her.

868
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:25,180
I bought her from her mother and
father for about $8 in American money.

869
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:29,490
The reason I paid such a big price for
hers was because she was a virgin. Yeah,

870
00:54:29,491 --> 00:54:32,920
so she said she was
about 11 or 12 years old.

871
00:54:32,921 --> 00:54:36,670
I took her to my shack the first night
and took her back to her father's and

872
00:54:36,671 --> 00:54:37,091
shack.

873
00:54:37,091 --> 00:54:40,750
The next I demanded my money back because
they had deceived me by saying the

874
00:54:40,751 --> 00:54:43,360
girl was a virgin.
I didn't get my money back,

875
00:54:43,361 --> 00:54:47,860
but they gave me another younger girl.
This girl was about eight years old.

876
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,800
I took her to my shack and
maybe she was a virgin,

877
00:54:50,801 --> 00:54:52,240
but it didn't look like it to me.

878
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:57,070
I took her back and quit looking for
any more virgin. I look for a boy.

879
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:00,730
I found one.
He was our table waiter.

880
00:55:00,731 --> 00:55:05,290
I educated him into the art of sodomy
as practiced by civilized people,

881
00:55:05,291 --> 00:55:10,000
but he was only a savage and didn't
appreciate the benefits of civilization.

882
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:14,380
He told my boss and the boss man
fired me quick, but before he did,

883
00:55:14,381 --> 00:55:19,340
I licked the hell out of them.
The boy,

884
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:23,810
11 or 12 came bombing. Another boy
about 11 or 12 came bumming around.

885
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,330
He was looking for something.
He found it too.

886
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:30,800
I took him out to a gravel pit about a
quarter mile from the main camp of the

887
00:55:30,801 --> 00:55:34,310
sing clear oil company.
I left him there,

888
00:55:34,311 --> 00:55:37,460
but first I committed sodomy
on him and then kill them.

889
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:44,310
His brains were coming out of his ears
when I left him and he will never be any

890
00:55:44,381 --> 00:55:46,330
debtor.
He is still there.

891
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:55,050
He ends up murdering another
six people in Africa on a boat.

892
00:55:55,080 --> 00:56:00,080
He chartered a canoe and then kills
everyone in it and then signs onto a ship

893
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,800
that's heading back to New York.

894
00:56:04,801 --> 00:56:09,540
That was the summer of 1922 he arrives
back in America back to the book in Salem,

895
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:10,231
Massachusetts.

896
00:56:10,231 --> 00:56:14,130
I'm murdered in 11 or 12 year old boy
by beating his brains out with a rock.

897
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:18,480
I tried a little sodomy on him first I
left him laying there with his brains

898
00:56:18,481 --> 00:56:19,680
coming out of his ears.

899
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:25,730
Went down towards New York robbing and
hell raising as I came in January or

900
00:56:27,101 --> 00:56:31,390
February of 1923 I got a job as a watchman
at two 20 Yonkers avenue, Yonkers,

901
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:32,224
New York.

902
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:37,330
While there I met a young boy of 14 or
15 or his name was George and whose home

903
00:56:37,331 --> 00:56:42,250
was in was an is in Yonkers. I started
to teach him the fine art of sodomy,

904
00:56:42,251 --> 00:56:47,170
but he had, but I found he had been
taught about it all and he liked it fine.

905
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:52,500
I kept him with me until I left that
job of night in April of 1923 the kid,

906
00:56:53,981 --> 00:56:57,430
George got scared and I let him go
home to Yonkers. When he got there,

907
00:56:57,431 --> 00:57:00,220
he told the police all he knew about me,
which wasn't much,

908
00:57:00,221 --> 00:57:02,380
but it was enough for the
cops to come looking for me.

909
00:57:02,381 --> 00:57:04,990
They caught me and my yacht at Nyack,

910
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:09,970
they took me boat and all
my plunger to Yonkers jail.

911
00:57:09,971 --> 00:57:14,740
They're charged me with sodomy, burglary,
robbery and trying to break jail there.

912
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:17,740
Yeah,

913
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:19,900
in and out again a few days.
He gets out.

914
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,840
A few days later I went to new
haven where I killed another boy.

915
00:57:22,841 --> 00:57:26,080
I committed a little more sodomy on him
and then tied his belt around his neck

916
00:57:26,081 --> 00:57:26,801
and strangled him,

917
00:57:26,801 --> 00:57:29,980
picked him up where he was when he was
dead and through his body over behind

918
00:57:29,981 --> 00:57:30,814
some bushes.

919
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:38,540
Eventually he does his time.
He gets trial for the, uh,

920
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:41,280
sodomy burglary and robbery,

921
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,690
pleads guilty and immediately
given the limit of the law,

922
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:50,710
five years at once I was sent to sing
sing and then from sing sing he gets sent

923
00:57:52,621 --> 00:57:54,600
to another prison called Dan and Mora,

924
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:58,410
which is a notorious,

925
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:04,530
notorious prison,
says in the book of all the prisons,

926
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:09,540
Dana Maura was the one and only
designed specifically to punish.

927
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:17,270
And so now this gets really interesting
because he's in this really bad prison

928
00:58:17,271 --> 00:58:21,260
does, and there's a description that's
not from him that's just part of the book,

929
00:58:21,261 --> 00:58:22,370
part of the information in the book,

930
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:27,620
talking about Dana Maura
and how bad it is there.

931
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:32,810
And then he's done a whole this heinous,
I mean,

932
00:58:32,811 --> 00:58:37,670
just heinous acts that he should be
killed for it over and over again.

933
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:42,950
And here he is. Um, going back to
the book, I attempted to escape.

934
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:47,960
I failed in my attempt, but in doing so,
I fell about 30 feet to a concrete walk,

935
00:58:47,961 --> 00:58:50,540
breaking both my ankles, both
my legs, fracturing my spine,

936
00:58:50,541 --> 00:58:52,460
and rupturing myself in this condition,

937
00:58:52,461 --> 00:58:55,430
I was carried to the prison hospital where
I leave for five days and was carried

938
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:59,840
out and dumped into a cell without any
medical or surgical attention, whatever.

939
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:04,610
My broken bones were not set, my ankles
and legs were not put into a cast.

940
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:07,130
In fact, nothing was done except
give me a bottle of Lindemann,

941
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:09,050
which I would have done,

942
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,920
which would have done no good if I
had been able to rub it on myself.

943
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:16,430
The doctor never came near me and no one
else was allowed to do anything for me

944
00:59:16,431 --> 00:59:19,730
in that condition. I was left for
eight months. At the end of the time,

945
00:59:19,731 --> 00:59:22,760
the bones had knitted together. I could
stagger around on a pair of crutches,

946
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,600
so it's like he's complaining
about his maltreatment, right?

947
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,660
I got injured and they didn't take
care of me. It's like, hey bro.

948
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:34,250
Yeah,
you don't get any good treatment.

949
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,710
At the end of 14 months of constant agony,

950
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:44,430
I was taken to the hospital where I was
operated on for my rupture and one of my

951
00:59:44,431 --> 00:59:46,950
testicles was cut out five
days after my operation.

952
00:59:46,951 --> 00:59:49,800
I tried to see if my sexual
organs were still in good order.

953
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:53,040
I got caught trying to commit
sodomy on another prisoner for that.

954
00:59:53,041 --> 00:59:56,040
I was thrown out of the hospital and
dumped into a cell where I suffered more

955
00:59:56,041 --> 01:00:00,330
agony for many months, always in pain,
never a civil answer from anyone.

956
01:00:00,331 --> 01:00:03,780
Always a smaller a cursor
allying hypocritical promise,

957
01:00:03,781 --> 01:00:07,550
which was never kept crawling around
like a snake with a broken back seething

958
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:11,070
with hatred and a lust for revenge.
Five years of my life of this kind.

959
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:12,900
Okay.

960
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:16,830
The last two years and four months
confined in isolation with nothing to do

961
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,680
except brood upon what
I thought the wrong,

962
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:22,110
what I fought was the wrongs
that had been done to me,

963
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,050
not allowed to receive letters
or visits from friends.

964
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:28,230
When the prison inspectors came to
investigate conditions and complaints,

965
01:00:28,231 --> 01:00:30,990
they were told I was a degenerate,
that I suffered from delusions,

966
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:32,460
that I was insane.

967
01:00:32,461 --> 01:00:36,180
So they would pay no attention to me
or anything that I or anyone else ever

968
01:00:36,181 --> 01:00:37,014
complained of.

969
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:38,290
Okay.

970
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:41,710
This went on for all of my five
years and the more they misused me,

971
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:44,440
the more I was filled with the
spirit of hatred and revenge.

972
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:48,850
I was so full of hate that there was no
room in me for such feelings as love,

973
01:00:48,851 --> 01:00:53,410
pity, kindness, or honor or
decency. I hated everyone. I saw,

974
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:57,740
uh,
again,

975
01:00:57,830 --> 01:01:02,120
it's a guy that t he only sees the
pain that's been caused to him,

976
01:01:02,121 --> 01:01:05,000
but apparently doesn't see any of the
pain that he's caused. Anybody else?

977
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:09,770
Zero. Empathy, zero.

978
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,800
Then it's sort of,
could it seem,

979
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,430
or could it happen like this
with him where, you know,

980
01:01:16,431 --> 01:01:19,460
when he's young he gets beat down.

981
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:23,260
[inaudible] obviously not
shown much affection. That's,

982
01:01:23,590 --> 01:01:27,110
that's the assumption obviously, but
beat down. So now he has this hatred,

983
01:01:27,111 --> 01:01:30,620
so now he inflicts pain on
quote Unquote Others. Mm. Right.

984
01:01:30,621 --> 01:01:32,300
Because of the hatred he has or whatever.

985
01:01:32,301 --> 01:01:35,000
So it's kind of like him kind
of what getting event for sure.

986
01:01:35,001 --> 01:01:38,750
Lack of a better term. So he gets even
and then he gets punished for that. Right.

987
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:41,810
Obviously because he can't commit
crimes like that. So he gets punished.

988
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:46,530
So now he thinks it's an uneven now, hey,
you know? Yeah. It's just the feeling.

989
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:48,920
He's not like, yes. So now he's like, oh,

990
01:01:48,921 --> 01:01:51,410
now that now me being punished
for what I did by the way,

991
01:01:51,411 --> 01:01:54,650
but me being punished has given me
even more hate. Now I got to, you know,

992
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:56,930
seek vengeance for that.
Then he does it.

993
01:01:56,931 --> 01:02:00,860
Then of course he gets and he just keeps
doing it. So it's like this cycle. Well,

994
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:01,101
the,

995
01:02:01,101 --> 01:02:05,330
there's another cycle here and the cycle
is he's blaming everyone else for the

996
01:02:05,331 --> 01:02:10,280
situation that isn't blaming everyone
and at a certain point, sure,

997
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:10,731
let's,

998
01:02:10,731 --> 01:02:15,470
let's blame that first state penitentiary
that he was in when he was a kid.

999
01:02:15,471 --> 01:02:20,100
The state school let, let's put some
blame on them. Okay. Yeah. But you got

1000
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:24,750
out of that and you had another
opportunity to get on the right path and,

1001
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:28,830
and then you, what do you do? You just
blame, blame, blame, blame, blame.

1002
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,350
And the more you're blaming other people,

1003
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:34,680
do you put yourself into a downward spiral
that he's never going to get out of,

1004
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:39,150
obviously. Yeah, they need,
now he's blaming. He blames
the whole human race. I mean,

1005
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:41,170
let's,
it's,

1006
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:46,270
it's real easy just to sorta s he only
writes about it for three sentences,

1007
01:02:46,441 --> 01:02:47,910
but like, oh, oh,

1008
01:02:47,911 --> 01:02:52,770
in new haven I raped and murdered
an 11 year old boy. Yeah. Like,

1009
01:02:52,771 --> 01:02:56,940
no, you don't get any mercy now. And you
can't blame anyone else for doing that.

1010
01:02:56,941 --> 01:03:00,330
That's no one else's fault you did that.
Yes.

1011
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:03,000
Yeah.
Okay.

1012
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:06,640
But in his mind, the o for shake,
you know how like when you hate,

1013
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:09,740
let's say you flick your friend
on the head joking around, right?

1014
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:11,400
You flip them on the head,
you don't care.

1015
01:03:11,810 --> 01:03:13,970
Then your friends liked to be
interested in friends, like, hey,

1016
01:03:13,971 --> 01:03:15,210
that was kind of heart, you know, so,

1017
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:18,710
so he'd like flicks you an escalation
for a hard and you're like, Hey,

1018
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:22,410
I did flick you on the head that
hard. So you smack them, you know?

1019
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:25,910
And it turns into this big fight and
who's who's, who's to blame, right? Yeah.

1020
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:28,640
Both guys feel like, Hey,
I flick y'all just joking.

1021
01:03:28,641 --> 01:03:30,270
You didn't have to flick me that hard.
The other guy like,

1022
01:03:30,271 --> 01:03:32,510
why'd you flick me in the first
place? You don't kind of thing. So,

1023
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:34,760
and I'm not saying that
that's what happened,

1024
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:37,970
but in his mind that's probably
what it feels like. Oh for sure.

1025
01:03:37,971 --> 01:03:40,040
That's what it feels like for sure.
That's what it feels like.

1026
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:44,060
And we all can feel like that at
one time or another. We think, oh,

1027
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:48,530
it's this person's fault, it's that
person's fault. It's my parents.

1028
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:49,970
It's the school system.

1029
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:53,580
It's the whatever. It's
society. Yeah, right.

1030
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:56,130
It's society.
Yeah.

1031
01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:59,790
It's every other human being like
that's where he's at right now.

1032
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:02,730
He hated everyone I saw.
Yeah. That's where he's at.

1033
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:07,020
It's like he's the victim and he's the
victim and just listened to. I mean,

1034
01:04:07,021 --> 01:04:10,020
it's so clear when he's talking about
all these medical problems that he,

1035
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,930
he's the victim.
He's the victim.

1036
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,830
Whereas if he would've just swapped
his attitude early on and said, okay,

1037
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:20,550
what about what's happening right
now? Even the first, why did he,

1038
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:23,550
why did he get sent to the
state penitentiary or to
the state school system?

1039
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:26,160
Because he stole a gun,
ran away,

1040
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:30,840
but it ripped it ripped off a family of
their stuff. Like, Oh, if you do that,

1041
01:04:30,841 --> 01:04:33,870
you go to prison. But he didn't see that
this is fault. That wasn't his fault.

1042
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:37,530
He did that because he was living
in a bad home. It's like, okay,

1043
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:42,000
at some point you have to take ownership
of what's going on in your world and

1044
01:04:42,001 --> 01:04:46,440
you can't just continually blame
other people. If you do eventually,

1045
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:48,990
you know who's at fault,
everyone in the world, but you.

1046
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,233
Yeah.

1047
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,580
It's true, so let's not get
there. I'll tell you what,

1048
01:04:53,581 --> 01:04:55,920
it was a pretty good transition
for when I joined the navy.

1049
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:59,060
That's one thing that I've talked
about how when I joined the navy tech,

1050
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:00,840
a clean slate,
you know what I mean?

1051
01:05:00,841 --> 01:05:04,230
Like it doesn't matter what you did and
that was a really positive thing for me

1052
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:06,390
because all of a sudden,

1053
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:11,480
and it's a very cause and effect when
you're going through like Navy boot camp

1054
01:05:11,791 --> 01:05:14,850
or any kind of boot camp,
any kind of military indoctrination,

1055
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:18,580
if you don't do what you're supposed
to do, you get punished for it.

1056
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:20,410
If you do what you're supposed to do,

1057
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:25,390
you either a don't get punished at a
minimum or you get some type of reward and

1058
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:28,600
it's all set up that way purposely,
but it's very easy.

1059
01:05:28,601 --> 01:05:33,010
It was very easy for me to comprehend
as an 18 year old kid going, Oh,

1060
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:37,330
if I, if I do this right,
I will be rewarded.

1061
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:41,260
If I do this wrong,
I will be punished.

1062
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,620
This is on me and then what you read.

1063
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:48,660
Then the next thing that they build
on top of that is if I let my team do

1064
01:05:49,781 --> 01:05:52,690
something wrong,
we will all get punished.

1065
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:56,500
If we do things correctly.
We will receive at a minimum,

1066
01:05:56,501 --> 01:05:58,570
no punishment and possibly
some type of reward.

1067
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:03,400
It was very easy for me to assemble
those pieces in my young brain.

1068
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:06,160
And let's face it,
when you're 18 years old,

1069
01:06:06,161 --> 01:06:08,790
I mean my brain wasn't all that develops,
right?

1070
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:13,240
I mean like physiologically speaking,
the Ma,

1071
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:13,841
like what does it,

1072
01:06:13,841 --> 01:06:18,370
the male frontal cortex isn't fully
formed until they're like 25 right?

1073
01:06:18,371 --> 01:06:20,560
Didn't you tell me that?
Yes. Yeah, so there you go.

1074
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:24,970
So there I was 18 and I yet was able
to figure out, okay, wait a second,

1075
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:29,440
if I do this, it's on
me. If I get punished,

1076
01:06:29,441 --> 01:06:33,070
it's my fault. If our team gets
punished and, and again, that's a,

1077
01:06:33,071 --> 01:06:36,040
that's a little jump there to kind of
bring you through that little phase of

1078
01:06:36,041 --> 01:06:39,550
like, okay, we get, now you're
responsible for you. You understand that.

1079
01:06:39,551 --> 01:06:42,190
And once you understand,
that's like, okay, now you're
responsible for your team.

1080
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:46,300
And some people don't make
that transition. Some people,
you know within the team,

1081
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:50,800
oh, it wasn't my fault. He
was Jimmy's fault. Right.

1082
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:55,390
And as you stay in the military
longer or as you go in any workforce,

1083
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:59,500
eventually you realize, okay, if we
don't, if I don't work as a team,

1084
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:03,130
we're all going to get punished.
So I needed help. The team,

1085
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:07,870
he's not learning any of this.
That helped me was awful.

1086
01:07:11,170 --> 01:07:14,740
Back to the book and my whole mind was
bent on figuring out ways to annoy and

1087
01:07:14,741 --> 01:07:18,370
punish my enemies and everybody
was my enemy. I had no friends.

1088
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:21,970
That was the frame of mind I was in when
my five years was up and I was turned

1089
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:23,650
loose to go anywhere I wanted to go.

1090
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,740
My intention was to rob
rape and kill everybody.

1091
01:07:26,741 --> 01:07:29,260
I could anybody and everybody,

1092
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:34,770
and he goes through these long kind
of plans of putting bombs in inside of

1093
01:07:36,611 --> 01:07:41,611
tunnels and and w how to get a gas mask
and he's be used poison gas and he's

1094
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,900
going to steal so much
money and then with this,

1095
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:48,850
with this bunch of money that he was
going to get from robbing all these people

1096
01:07:48,851 --> 01:07:53,710
in in these plot that he has with that,

1097
01:07:53,711 --> 01:07:56,110
he says with unlimited funds in my hands,

1098
01:07:56,111 --> 01:07:59,380
I then intended to steal millions of
dollars and killed millions of people.

1099
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:03,250
This I intended to do by starting
a war between England and the USA.

1100
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:06,040
Sounds fantastic. All right, but
I'm positive he could have done it.

1101
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:08,350
He goes through his whole plot of
how he was going to make that happen.

1102
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:11,620
He was going to bomb a British
ship that was, you know,

1103
01:08:11,621 --> 01:08:15,860
like here peacefully bomb it and
make it look like America did it when

1104
01:08:15,861 --> 01:08:20,120
diplomatic relationship for we're already
strained. That was his plant. Hmm.

1105
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:23,840
That's crazy. I used to spend
all my time for, you're not high.

1106
01:08:23,841 --> 01:08:26,780
Could murder the most people with
the least harm and expense to myself.

1107
01:08:26,781 --> 01:08:31,430
And I finally thought of a way to kill
off the whole town. Men, women, children,

1108
01:08:31,431 --> 01:08:32,810
and even cats and dogs.

1109
01:08:32,811 --> 01:08:36,370
And he goes through another big
plan about using arsenic and,

1110
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:39,530
and dead hogs and put
them in the water swim.

1111
01:08:39,531 --> 01:08:41,720
He goes through like detailed plants,

1112
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:46,163
okay.

1113
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:50,620
Now this was some interesting,

1114
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:55,900
his perception of what it was
like. He's back in jail again. Um,

1115
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:57,700
and I forget what for this time,

1116
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,790
but for all this crap that
he's doing all the time,

1117
01:09:00,791 --> 01:09:05,020
all these crimes he's committing back to
the book of the underworld code is very

1118
01:09:05,021 --> 01:09:09,280
simple. It is never squeal.
Don't be a stool pigeon.

1119
01:09:09,281 --> 01:09:13,840
A rat on informer. All crooks want
everybody else to believe that they are.

1120
01:09:13,841 --> 01:09:15,700
Square cops are the same.

1121
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,850
They all wish everybody else to
think they act from principle.

1122
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:23,830
They are always telling everyone they
meet about how much principal they have.

1123
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:26,140
It is against their
principal to do this or that.

1124
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:30,460
The queer part of it is that they
not only want others to believe this,

1125
01:09:30,490 --> 01:09:32,050
but they believe it themselves.

1126
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:37,680
But the real truth of the matter is
that they deceive themselves and mistake

1127
01:09:37,681 --> 01:09:42,480
policy for principle,
when crooks are square with anyone,

1128
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:47,780
it is because it is for their own interest
to be so it is good policy when it

1129
01:09:50,341 --> 01:09:53,850
ceases to be in their own interest
to square with another one,

1130
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:58,200
then it becomes time to change their
tactics and they aren't slowing doing it

1131
01:09:58,201 --> 01:10:01,230
either. It makes no difference
to them who they snitch on,

1132
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:04,530
no matter if they had been loyal to
each other through a whole lifetime as

1133
01:10:04,531 --> 01:10:05,400
partners and friends,

1134
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:09,990
no matter if they send their friends
to prison or to hell by way of rope or

1135
01:10:09,991 --> 01:10:12,240
chair,
that cuts no ice.

1136
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:16,560
They are looking out for
their own precious skins.

1137
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:26,970
No, this is a guy also that
doesn't trust anybody. So,

1138
01:10:28,110 --> 01:10:31,710
and that's actually what he said.
I mean certainly that's theirs.

1139
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:34,860
You can't say that about it.
You can say that about a lot of people,

1140
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:38,550
but there's all kinds of
criminals that never give up.

1141
01:10:38,850 --> 01:10:42,630
The never, never given him his
names, never rat on anybody else.

1142
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:47,390
And they get the book thrown
at him and they take it back.

1143
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:49,590
The book every child has,
this is interesting.

1144
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:51,930
Every child has some criminal tendencies.

1145
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,860
It is your place to correct those traits
and teach them the right way to live

1146
01:10:56,010 --> 01:11:00,450
while they are young and they're minds
are forming. Then when they do the reach,

1147
01:11:00,451 --> 01:11:05,100
the age of reason and action, it will
be quite natural for them to live clean,

1148
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:08,130
upright, honorable lives. In that way,

1149
01:11:08,131 --> 01:11:11,640
you will stop crime at its
source before it begins

1150
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:17,220
as a child,
a child is very easily led.

1151
01:11:17,221 --> 01:11:21,870
Any child of properly taught will
live the way he is taught to live.

1152
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:25,260
All criminals are merely
overgrown children.

1153
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:28,830
It is in your hands to
make us or break us.

1154
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:32,670
We buy our own efforts are failures in
life simply because we don't know any

1155
01:11:32,671 --> 01:11:35,340
better. We don't know how to
live decent, upright lives.

1156
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:39,900
Hereditary heredity has very little
to do with the shaping of our lives.

1157
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:45,360
The main causes of why we are what we
are is because of our improper teaching,

1158
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:48,180
lack of knowledge and our environment.

1159
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,850
Every man's philosophy is
colored by his environment.

1160
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:57,110
If you don't want us to rob rape and
murder you than it is your place to see

1161
01:11:57,111 --> 01:11:59,630
that the mental and moral
misfits are properly taught,

1162
01:11:59,631 --> 01:12:04,060
a sufficient amount of useful insensible
knowledge to put their proper to and

1163
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:08,930
put into the proper environment where
they can be best fitted to exist in life.

1164
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:15,010
So there you go. The nature,
nurture, argument, pans, Ram, all,

1165
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:18,820
all nurture. It's all
how you're raised. Hmm.

1166
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:22,060
It goes on.
I was born a normal human being.

1167
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:26,050
My parents were ignorant and through
their improper teachings and improper

1168
01:12:26,051 --> 01:12:29,470
environment, I was gradually led
into the wrong way of living.

1169
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:32,350
Little by little from Brat,
bad to worse.

1170
01:12:32,351 --> 01:12:36,400
I was sent to reform school at
age 11 from that day to this,

1171
01:12:36,401 --> 01:12:40,840
all of my life has been lived
among moral and mental misfits.

1172
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:45,620
All my associates, all my
surroundings, the atmosphere of deceit,

1173
01:12:45,621 --> 01:12:47,570
treachery brutality,
degeneracy,

1174
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:51,260
hypocrisy and everything that
is bad and nothing that is good.

1175
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:57,020
It is unnatural that I
should have absorbed these
things and I've become what I

1176
01:12:57,021 --> 01:13:00,350
am today. A treacherous,
degenerate, brutal, savage,

1177
01:13:00,351 --> 01:13:05,210
human devoid of all decent feeling.
Absolutely. Without conscience,

1178
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:08,360
moral pity,
sympathy principal,

1179
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:12,200
or any single good trait.
Why am I what I am?

1180
01:13:12,230 --> 01:13:15,350
I'll tell you why I did
not make myself what I am.

1181
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:18,020
Others had the making of me

1182
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:25,470
everyone else's fault,

1183
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:33,030
and I'm not in the power to control it.
Right?

1184
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:36,930
I mean,
at this point he recognizes what he is,

1185
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:41,840
but he doesn't make any effort
to reform himself. Yeah. Yeah.

1186
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:46,740
It's kind of those two, like even
with extreme ownership, right?

1187
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:48,030
When you're working with a team,

1188
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:53,450
when you say it's easy to blame others
and especially when it is their fault at

1189
01:13:55,141 --> 01:13:59,040
certain times, it's like their fault
that this happened to, that happened.

1190
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:04,350
It's like a philosophy,
right? It's like an approach.

1191
01:14:04,351 --> 01:14:07,290
It's a certain approach where
you say, okay, you know,

1192
01:14:07,291 --> 01:14:09,810
whatever their fault that
this happened or whatever.

1193
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:12,130
It's really hard to up with a situation

1194
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:14,740
when you're a leader of a
team and it's the teams fault.

1195
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:15,350
Yeah.

1196
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:20,330
I haven't been able to come up
with one lately and to say it's,

1197
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:25,340
maybe you can, that's not what I'm
saying. What I'm saying is it is,

1198
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:29,570
well, okay, we'll go with this
guy. Oh, guidance from a guy
on Twitter. Yeah. He said,

1199
01:14:29,571 --> 01:14:30,404
hey man,

1200
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:34,430
why are you giving all this
hate to machine gunners
shooting outside their field

1201
01:14:34,431 --> 01:14:36,860
of fire? Because I use that
example a lot. Yeah. Hey,

1202
01:14:36,861 --> 01:14:39,140
the machine gunner shoots off
the outside of his field of fire.

1203
01:14:40,190 --> 01:14:43,760
That's the machine gunners fault,
right? No. And I said, dude, hey man,

1204
01:14:43,761 --> 01:14:44,670
I don't hate machine gunners.

1205
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:47,960
I hate the officer's that blame the
machine gunner when the machine gunner

1206
01:14:47,961 --> 01:14:50,590
doesn't know where he's supposed to be
shooting that thought machine gunners

1207
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:55,490
fault. That's your fault boss. Yeah.
So so continue on about the situation

1208
01:14:55,890 --> 01:14:57,960
trying to refer to,
so I,

1209
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:01,250
this is like a typical little thing that
I'll hear from people. It's like wow,

1210
01:15:01,310 --> 01:15:03,830
you know, sometimes I got to take
ownership even though it's really,

1211
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:09,290
that's what you think you're wrong.
Yeah, no, no raw. Okay. Gag. I dig it.

1212
01:15:09,291 --> 01:15:14,080
But cause because right now I'm not
saying about whose fault it is and that's

1213
01:15:14,081 --> 01:15:17,960
not, that's not the point I'm trying
to make. It's more that he's right.

1214
01:15:17,990 --> 01:15:19,790
It is because of them.

1215
01:15:19,791 --> 01:15:23,630
Like they or the way his parents raised
him did cause him to be like this.

1216
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:27,320
It caused him to be like this
and it cause him to be hit.

1217
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:32,030
Like it didn't like his parents
raising them didn't make him, you know,

1218
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:35,840
sodomized that kid or whatever. He
didn't, they didn't make him do it,

1219
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:40,350
but their rate of the way they raised
him caused him just cause it effect

1220
01:15:40,351 --> 01:15:44,390
straight up caused him to be
like that quote unquote no,

1221
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:48,820
it's his fault. Yes. It's his fault that
he's doing all these things, you know,

1222
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:50,780
cause you can just not,
you can not do it.

1223
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:55,220
That's possible to just not do it
that day or add or whatever. So yeah.

1224
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:59,090
As far as fault and blaming, yes. Okay.
You're going Sam Harris Freewill on me.

1225
01:15:59,150 --> 01:16:02,540
Well see the thing is,

1226
01:16:02,541 --> 01:16:07,370
I mean I guess what I'm saying is like
if you don't grow into lack of freewill

1227
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:10,250
yeah. Lack of freewill.
No, well not necessarily.

1228
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:14,750
I'm just basically isolating the blaming
part of it and then the cause and

1229
01:16:14,751 --> 01:16:18,950
effect part of it, you know,
kind of thing. Because in
that case he's, he's right.

1230
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:21,620
Like there what he's saying is correct.

1231
01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:25,280
As long as he's not saying and it's their
fault and it's not my fault. I'm not,

1232
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:29,180
you know who he is saying that?
Yes. Okay, so, so push that aside.

1233
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:31,400
He's writing on sentence myself.

1234
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,710
What I am.
Others had the making of me.

1235
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,750
It's everyone else's fault that I'm
like this. Yeah, that's, that's,

1236
01:16:36,850 --> 01:16:39,080
that's not extreme on a shit right there.
No,

1237
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:44,630
but oh gold cause an effect on them.
Here's my point.

1238
01:16:44,870 --> 01:16:48,020
Here's my point because this is
not, this is a gray area, right?

1239
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:52,940
We're in a gray area. Here's
the problem. If he looks at it,

1240
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:58,240
if he only lens that he
looks at it through is this
is everyone else's fault and

1241
01:16:58,431 --> 01:17:02,630
he's not to blame, then guess what?
He's not going to make any changes.

1242
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:08,090
If he had a little bit, if he just
looked at the situation and said,

1243
01:17:08,091 --> 01:17:09,590
you know what?
All these happened,

1244
01:17:11,690 --> 01:17:14,650
but some of this is because of me.
Yeah.

1245
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:19,310
Some of this is because the actions
that I've taken and I can now change my

1246
01:17:19,311 --> 01:17:23,990
behavior so I don't stay in this
mode of operating right now.

1247
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:27,860
That's the difference. Yeah,
and he never makes that change.

1248
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:31,340
He never makes that that different.
He never sees it that way.

1249
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:36,590
The only thing he sees is that it's
everyone else's fault and when you,

1250
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:40,910
this is the thing he goes, you can
see it gradually increases. He's,

1251
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:44,780
he's going from like, oh I just hate
this teachers and and I just hate them,

1252
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:49,310
the wardens and eventually
he hates everybody cause
it's everyone else's fault.

1253
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:53,030
Even people he doesn't even know because
they're a member of the human race.

1254
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:53,983
He hates them.

1255
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:54,973
Yeah.

1256
01:17:56,930 --> 01:18:01,490
That's why personal responsibility, so
important to teach to kids. Yes sir.

1257
01:18:01,491 --> 01:18:03,560
It is so important to teach the kids

1258
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,680
and that's one thing I think I learned.

1259
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:08,840
I mean obviously I've got
some of it from my parents,

1260
01:18:08,841 --> 01:18:13,130
but it was really crystal clear when I
came when I came in the military because

1261
01:18:13,131 --> 01:18:15,500
it's black and white that
the gray area is gone.

1262
01:18:15,501 --> 01:18:18,620
When you go through some kind of military
indoctrination, the gray area is gone.

1263
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:21,770
You mess this up, it's your fault. You're
going to get punished for it. Yeah.

1264
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:25,550
We still get guys right that oh sure.
For sure.

1265
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:28,510
Drill sergeant is writing me
or whatever or you know, Bill,

1266
01:18:28,511 --> 01:18:32,120
he should have done this. Jones should
have done that. Right? It's like okay,

1267
01:18:32,121 --> 01:18:35,210
but it doesn't matter. Sure. Yeah.
Okay. The man, does it matter

1268
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:40,040
back to the book,
I have only a little knowledge,

1269
01:18:40,041 --> 01:18:43,700
but I have as much intelligence as the
average person and I know I was taught

1270
01:18:43,701 --> 01:18:47,720
wrong. I could have been taught
properly and if I had been,

1271
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:51,170
I sure feel I would led a far
different life than I have done.

1272
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:57,100
You are to blame more so
than I just straight up you.

1273
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:02,750
He's talking to us, talking to her
general human, the race of human beings.

1274
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:04,730
That's my belief.

1275
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:07,730
If you are going to go on teaching
others as you have taught me,

1276
01:19:07,731 --> 01:19:10,850
then you must suffer the same as I.

1277
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:16,423
Uh,

1278
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:17,500
here we go.

1279
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:22,560
He is at this point on trial
and this is from like a,

1280
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:27,520
I think this is one of the ones from
a newspaper clipping or report, but

1281
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:32,260
it's another part. This is so
this isn't pants, Rams Journal.

1282
01:19:32,261 --> 01:19:36,280
This is some of the additional information
back to the book on the stand pan.

1283
01:19:36,281 --> 01:19:40,240
Drums, eyes slid toward the table
where his pistol and burglar tools lay.

1284
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:44,380
Prosecutor Collins whispered to an
assistant who hurried over and remove the

1285
01:19:44,381 --> 01:19:46,570
exhibits to a safer place.

1286
01:19:47,530 --> 01:19:51,040
The arms of the witness chair
disappeared under pans, rams,

1287
01:19:51,041 --> 01:19:54,910
huge hands as he faced the jury
ignoring everyone else in the courtroom,

1288
01:19:55,330 --> 01:20:00,070
you people got me here charged with
housebreaking in larceny. I'm guilty.

1289
01:20:00,190 --> 01:20:04,960
I broken and I stole what I didn't steal.
I smashed. If the owner had come home,

1290
01:20:04,961 --> 01:20:08,880
I would have knocked his
brains out. Pans, rems,

1291
01:20:08,881 --> 01:20:12,150
eyes took on this, uh, strange
depth as he watched the jury.

1292
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:16,050
There's something else you ought to
know while you were trying me here,

1293
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:20,070
I was trying all of you too.
I've found you guilty.

1294
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:24,750
Some of you I've executed. If I
live, I'll execute some more of you.

1295
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:28,470
I hate the whole human race.
He said evenly,

1296
01:20:29,550 --> 01:20:32,040
a juror gasped. Pans, Ramsay.

1297
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:37,080
Round heads suddenly swung
toward the prosecutor who
looked alert and suspicious.

1298
01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:41,280
You think I'm playing crazy, don't
you? I'm not. I know right from wrong.

1299
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:44,730
No delusions. I don't hear
anything. You don't care.

1300
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:48,660
My conscience doesn't bother me.
I have no conscience.

1301
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:53,830
I believe the whole human race should
be exterminated. I'll do my best to do,

1302
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,010
do it.
Every chance I get

1303
01:20:57,510 --> 01:20:59,820
the courtroom was now numb as pans.

1304
01:20:59,821 --> 01:21:02,580
Ram turned to the doors once more.

1305
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:07,740
Now I've done my duty.
You do yours.

1306
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:13,563
So

1307
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:22,060
he gets a long prison sentence
and when he gets into prison,

1308
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:28,160
he actually kills a, uh, one of the
civilian workers. They're in prison.

1309
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:32,640
Like a guy that just, is it like a
maintenance guy who runs the laundry and

1310
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:37,820
he's
has a beef and kills him.

1311
01:21:38,990 --> 01:21:39,823
And

1312
01:21:40,570 --> 01:21:42,460
this is where we start.
This isn't one of the letters.

1313
01:21:42,461 --> 01:21:45,780
So I talked about the Guy
Henry lessor who was a garden,

1314
01:21:45,790 --> 01:21:48,610
one of the prisons he was in who formed
a relationship with him when he actually

1315
01:21:48,611 --> 01:21:51,280
says a couple of times that this is the
only guy that like didn't try and take

1316
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:53,260
some from, I think the whole
thing started off a game,

1317
01:21:53,261 --> 01:21:57,220
like a dollar to buy cigarettes
or whatever and no one,

1318
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:58,413
according to him,

1319
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:03,400
no one had ever done anything nice
for pan drowned in his whole life.

1320
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,530
And this,
this garden was the first guy to do it.

1321
01:22:05,531 --> 01:22:07,750
So he develops a relationship with them

1322
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:13,000
and so they go,
they write letters back and forth,

1323
01:22:14,410 --> 01:22:18,700
and here's the excerpt of one of
those many letters back to the book.

1324
01:22:18,710 --> 01:22:23,440
The real truth of the matter is that I
haven't the least desire to reform very

1325
01:22:23,441 --> 01:22:25,420
much.
The reserve reverse of that is true.

1326
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:30,100
I would not reform if the front
gate was open right now and I was,

1327
01:22:30,190 --> 01:22:32,560
and if I was given $1
million when I stepped out,

1328
01:22:32,830 --> 01:22:36,040
I have no desire to do good or to be good.

1329
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:40,930
I am just as mean now as I can be and the
only reason I am no worse is because I

1330
01:22:40,931 --> 01:22:44,440
lacked the power and the proper
opportunity for meanness.

1331
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,750
If I had the power and the opportunities,

1332
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:50,380
then I would soon show you
what real meanness was.

1333
01:22:51,070 --> 01:22:54,880
You overlook the fact that the law and
a great many people have been trying

1334
01:22:54,881 --> 01:22:57,370
their damnedest for 25 years to reform me.

1335
01:22:57,580 --> 01:22:59,980
I am tired of having
people try to reform me.

1336
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:04,720
What I want to do is reform them and I
think the best way to reform them is to

1337
01:23:04,721 --> 01:23:09,130
put out of their misery.
It took me 36 years to be like I am now.

1338
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:13,780
Then how do you figure that I could if I
wanted to change from black to white in

1339
01:23:13,781 --> 01:23:15,130
the twinkling of an eye?

1340
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,433
Another letter,

1341
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:28,900
same theme.

1342
01:23:28,901 --> 01:23:33,340
I have no desire to reform under such
conditions as would be required of me the

1343
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:37,180
way the laws of this country are today.
I do not care to live any longer.

1344
01:23:37,181 --> 01:23:38,500
If I must live in prison,

1345
01:23:38,710 --> 01:23:42,430
I would far rather die and go to hell
if that's where people like me go after

1346
01:23:42,431 --> 01:23:43,030
death.

1347
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:47,410
I've very thoroughly considered this
matter and I assure you now what I say is

1348
01:23:47,411 --> 01:23:51,250
the truth.
I've confessed 21 different cold blooded,

1349
01:23:51,251 --> 01:23:55,420
premeditated murders,
hundreds of cations of cases of arson,

1350
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:58,810
burglaries, robberies,
rapes, and other crimes.

1351
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:04,480
The law has by this time looked them
up and verify the truth of my various

1352
01:24:04,481 --> 01:24:05,314
confessions.

1353
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:10,560
My philosophy of life is such that very
few people ever get and just so deeply

1354
01:24:11,081 --> 01:24:14,920
ingrained and burned into me that I don't
believe I could ever change my beliefs.

1355
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:17,110
The things I've done to others,

1356
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:21,280
the things that I have had done to me
by others and the things I have done to

1357
01:24:21,281 --> 01:24:26,170
them can never be forgotten or
forgiven either by me or others.

1358
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:31,720
I can't forget and I won't forgive.
I couldn't if I wanted to.

1359
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:35,380
The law is in the same fix.

1360
01:24:38,270 --> 01:24:43,270
My belief is that the life without
liberty is not worth having.

1361
01:24:43,730 --> 01:24:45,950
If a law won't kill me,
I shall kill myself.

1362
01:24:45,951 --> 01:24:50,030
I fully realize that I am not fit to live
among people in a civilized community.

1363
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:53,900
I have no desire to do so.
If I had any choice in living any longer,

1364
01:24:53,901 --> 01:24:58,070
the only way I would consent to do so
would be to get clear out and away from

1365
01:24:58,071 --> 01:24:59,480
all civilized people.

1366
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:04,340
I'm so set in my ways that I cannot adapt
myself to the ways of other people so

1367
01:25:04,341 --> 01:25:09,341
that the only way for me to do would
be to live by myself without any human

1368
01:25:09,891 --> 01:25:11,750
companionship.
Whatever.

1369
01:25:17,230 --> 01:25:19,950
He actually describes
this island that he's

1370
01:25:22,370 --> 01:25:26,770
kind of spent a little time on when he
was down in South America. Then he's like,

1371
01:25:26,771 --> 01:25:28,480
send me there if you wanted
to send me somewhere,

1372
01:25:31,990 --> 01:25:34,530
goes back.
So now he'd killed that other guy,

1373
01:25:34,550 --> 01:25:38,760
wonky the civilian and now he's
going to trial for that murder.

1374
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:46,040
And this is a newspaper
report of that trial.

1375
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:48,951
Back to the book,

1376
01:25:48,951 --> 01:25:53,750
the commission heard the hard boiled
giant tell of the fun which he received in

1377
01:25:53,751 --> 01:25:55,970
killing a man and there
isn't a man in this room.

1378
01:25:55,971 --> 01:26:00,971
I wouldn't kill the cruel visage steel
eyed man told the commission I mad plenty

1379
01:26:02,781 --> 01:26:05,960
mad. Now I don't believe
there's any good in any man.

1380
01:26:05,961 --> 01:26:08,120
I'd like to have the
opportunity to go weigh,

1381
01:26:08,270 --> 01:26:12,170
gain power and brains and then I'd
like to kill off the rest of the world.

1382
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,340
The convict said,

1383
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:15,130
okay.

1384
01:26:15,130 --> 01:26:19,270
Dr. Perry asked the giant if he believed
himself better than the rest of mankind.

1385
01:26:19,510 --> 01:26:21,220
Hell no was the reply.

1386
01:26:21,490 --> 01:26:24,640
I've checked up on myself lately and I
know that I'm probably worse than the

1387
01:26:24,641 --> 01:26:27,880
rest of you. I have no desire
to live. If you would hang me,

1388
01:26:27,881 --> 01:26:30,340
my troubles would be over
and I would be better. Yeah,

1389
01:26:30,410 --> 01:26:31,243
rough,

1390
01:26:33,450 --> 01:26:36,600
but don't you fear Hell Fire?
A member of the commission inquired.

1391
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:40,560
You haven't been able to prove to me
that there is such a thing. Penn pans,

1392
01:26:40,561 --> 01:26:45,210
ram answered the man boasted in court of
killing 21 person's and vowed that when

1393
01:26:45,211 --> 01:26:48,240
his parents were his parents living,
he would kill them.

1394
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:51,000
Quote for bringing me into the world.

1395
01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:52,540
Okay.

1396
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:56,020
There are two things in this world that
count as powerful money and knowledge.

1397
01:26:56,021 --> 01:27:00,370
If I could get enough money, I would
buy brains because brains are for sale.

1398
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:04,030
I could get a brainy chemist and I would
have them prepare me a lot of poison

1399
01:27:04,031 --> 01:27:04,990
gas and germs.

1400
01:27:04,991 --> 01:27:08,770
With these I would be able to
exterminate a great mass of human beings.

1401
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:10,360
Then I would kill myself.

1402
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:14,920
Society should build a great monument
because I have never propagated my kind.

1403
01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:25,080
So that's what his little excerpt
of what his trial was like. This,

1404
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:28,260
you know, he was done. I
mean he just did not care.

1405
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,220
Back to the book,
and this is the good book itself.

1406
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:35,490
The court convened again the next morning
and the judge having been given no

1407
01:27:35,491 --> 01:27:39,330
alternative by the hard rural jury look
down at the defendant and pronounced him

1408
01:27:39,331 --> 01:27:43,470
guilty with no mention of lifesaving
phrase without capital punishment pans.

1409
01:27:43,471 --> 01:27:45,690
Ram had nothing to say
concerning the sentence.

1410
01:27:45,810 --> 01:27:50,810
Hopkins then ordered that he be remanded
with to the care of the warden at the

1411
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:54,780
Federal Penitentiary Penitentiary at
Leavenworth there to be confined until the

1412
01:27:54,781 --> 01:27:58,290
fifth day of September when between the
hours of six and nine o'clock in the

1413
01:27:58,291 --> 01:28:01,980
morning, you shall be taken to some
suitable place within the confines of the

1414
01:28:01,981 --> 01:28:05,160
penitentiary and hanged
by the neck until dead.

1415
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:12,660
The judge then announced
the 90 day interval to allow
for any bill of objection

1416
01:28:12,661 --> 01:28:16,620
and appeal before the defense attorney
could speak pans. Ram said swiftly.

1417
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:20,250
I don't want any attorney to file
for a new trial or appeal anything.

1418
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,170
I am satisfied with the verdict.

1419
01:28:27,850 --> 01:28:31,600
So while he's now on death row,

1420
01:28:31,601 --> 01:28:36,130
there's a like a delegation of people
that are against capital punishment and

1421
01:28:36,131 --> 01:28:38,440
they start fighting to
get them off death row.

1422
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:40,160
Yeah.

1423
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:44,090
And he writes them a letter and
here's a little part of that letter.

1424
01:28:44,091 --> 01:28:45,770
On February 1st,

1425
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:49,340
1929 I began serving this sentence at
the u s penitentiary at 11 worth Kansas.

1426
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:52,760
On June 20th,
1929 I murdered one man,

1427
01:28:53,150 --> 01:28:56,230
a civilian employee of the
prison by the name of warranty.

1428
01:28:57,150 --> 01:29:01,680
And at the same time and place I also
attempted to murder a dozen other both

1429
01:29:01,681 --> 01:29:02,910
guards and convicts.

1430
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:06,480
The only reason I did not kill them
was also because I couldn't catch them.

1431
01:29:08,100 --> 01:29:08,880
If I give,

1432
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:13,080
if I'm given another trial or if the
death sentence should be commuted to life

1433
01:29:13,090 --> 01:29:16,740
imprisonment either in
penitentiary or an insane asylum,

1434
01:29:16,830 --> 01:29:18,510
it will be against my will.

1435
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:20,390
Okay.

1436
01:29:20,390 --> 01:29:22,910
And then he goes on to
try to explain to them,

1437
01:29:22,911 --> 01:29:25,940
cause he doesn't want them to think that
he's crazy because if he's crazy then

1438
01:29:25,941 --> 01:29:30,020
he's not, he's going to get it's insane
asylum or you know, reason of insanity.

1439
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:32,691
Back to the book.

1440
01:29:32,691 --> 01:29:35,660
I shall try and convince you that
I am quite saying at this time,

1441
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:42,620
I am at this time, 38 years
old, a big powerful man,
strong in both body and mind.

1442
01:29:42,621 --> 01:29:45,350
My physical fitness is not
as good as it once was,

1443
01:29:45,530 --> 01:29:48,440
but my mental facilities
are unimpaired in any way.

1444
01:29:48,441 --> 01:29:52,280
I've never used drugs of
any kind or any type. I am.

1445
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:55,940
I am and always have been a
very moderate drinker of liquor,

1446
01:29:55,941 --> 01:29:57,530
practically a total abstainer.

1447
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:02,100
I've never taken any disease of any kind
which would have the tendency to weaken

1448
01:30:02,101 --> 01:30:02,934
my intellect.

1449
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:08,820
I have never been addicted to any habits
of sexual excesses of any kind over

1450
01:30:08,991 --> 01:30:11,420
which I didn't have
complete control of myself.

1451
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:17,790
I choose to die here and now by being
hanged by the neck until I'm dead.

1452
01:30:17,791 --> 01:30:22,320
I prefer that I die that way and if I
have a soul and if that soul should burn

1453
01:30:22,321 --> 01:30:25,920
in hell for a million years still,
I prefer that to a lingering,

1454
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:29,910
agonizing death in some prison dungeon
or a padded cell and a mad house.

1455
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:35,550
I do not believe that being hanged by
the neck until dead is a barbaric or in

1456
01:30:35,551 --> 01:30:36,570
human punishment.

1457
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:41,610
I look forward to to it as a real pleasure
and a big relief for me and not feel

1458
01:30:41,611 --> 01:30:45,270
bad or unhappy about it in any way
everyday since I received that sentence,

1459
01:30:45,271 --> 01:30:46,260
I've felt pretty good.

1460
01:30:46,410 --> 01:30:49,560
I feel good right now and I believe
that when my last hour comes,

1461
01:30:49,561 --> 01:30:53,580
I will dance out of my dungeon and onto
the scaffold with a smile on my face and

1462
01:30:53,581 --> 01:30:54,690
happiness in my heart.

1463
01:30:54,930 --> 01:30:58,560
Another reason why I believe that this
sentence should be carried out is because

1464
01:30:58,561 --> 01:31:02,490
I believe it is justice and I am
quite sincere when I say that.

1465
01:31:02,491 --> 01:31:06,870
This is the first and only time in my
life of battling with the law that I ever

1466
01:31:06,871 --> 01:31:08,700
did get justice from the law.

1467
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:15,360
One other thing I am going to tell you
before I stopped this letter and that is

1468
01:31:15,361 --> 01:31:15,990
this,

1469
01:31:15,990 --> 01:31:20,010
the only thanks that you are your kind
will ever get from me for your efforts on

1470
01:31:20,011 --> 01:31:24,360
my behalf is that I wish you all had
one neck and then I had my hands on it.

1471
01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:26,100
Okay.

1472
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:28,050
I would sure put you out of your misery.

1473
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:31,020
Just the same as I've done
with numbers of other people.

1474
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:33,583
Yeah.

1475
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:36,960
I have no desire,
whatever to reform myself.

1476
01:31:36,961 --> 01:31:40,110
My only desires to reform
people who try to reform me,

1477
01:31:40,111 --> 01:31:45,060
and I believe that the only way to
do reform to people is to kill him.

1478
01:31:48,190 --> 01:31:53,130
My motto is rape a mall,
rob a mall and kill them all.

1479
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:58,620
I am very truly yours.
Carl Pans Ram

1480
01:32:09,770 --> 01:32:10,603
another

1481
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:14,050
letter,

1482
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:18,770
I think it was the next to the last letter
that he wrote to Lesser Henry Lusher.

1483
01:32:18,830 --> 01:32:19,301
He says,

1484
01:32:19,301 --> 01:32:23,410
I had no choice about coming into this
world and nearly 38 nearly all of my 38

1485
01:32:23,411 --> 01:32:27,580
years in that have had very little to say
and do about how I should live my life.

1486
01:32:27,610 --> 01:32:30,610
People have driven me into
doing everything I've ever done.

1487
01:32:32,870 --> 01:32:36,440
Now, the time has come when I refuse
to be driven any further, so again,

1488
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:38,270
I've just done,

1489
01:32:38,270 --> 01:32:40,730
I've only done what I've done because
of what other people have done to me.

1490
01:32:42,110 --> 01:32:46,340
That's not on me.
Zero responsibility.

1491
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:52,100
Everything I've ever done is
because of other people ever,

1492
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:53,353
ever.

1493
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:58,940
It's a slippery slope that you just
tried to step on him for a couple minutes

1494
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:01,400
ago. Yes, it is actually
in your thinking about it

1495
01:33:01,410 --> 01:33:02,270
[inaudible] aren't you?
Yeah,

1496
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:08,180
but I'm not wrong because I'm
not talking about the blame.

1497
01:33:08,181 --> 01:33:12,110
I'm talking about cause and effect. But
here's the thing though, caused an effect.

1498
01:33:12,111 --> 01:33:16,160
It's kind of like that's easy to start
blaming. You know you got us this,

1499
01:33:16,810 --> 01:33:20,330
see what I'm saying?
Technically I want to split hairs,

1500
01:33:20,331 --> 01:33:21,860
but technically there's a difference.

1501
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:26,800
Okay.

1502
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,410
My point is if you have the Aetnas this,

1503
01:33:29,411 --> 01:33:33,850
I mean I work with people all the time
and this is the most important transition

1504
01:33:33,851 --> 01:33:35,290
that people make in their brain

1505
01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:38,980
is whether you're a business leader,

1506
01:33:38,981 --> 01:33:40,690
whether you're talking
about your personal life,

1507
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:44,620
whether you're talking about the, the
family, whatever you're talking about,

1508
01:33:45,070 --> 01:33:48,310
the transition that you make from
doing what you're saying right now,

1509
01:33:48,311 --> 01:33:50,150
which is like, well, it's
actually their fault. They've,

1510
01:33:50,210 --> 01:33:55,180
that's in the back of your mind. Okay.
If that's in the back of your mind like,

1511
01:33:55,181 --> 01:33:59,410
okay, the problem is it grows.
Yeah. The problem is you use that.

1512
01:33:59,860 --> 01:34:03,580
The Prom is next thing, you know, it's
not just that their fault, it's this,

1513
01:34:03,581 --> 01:34:04,150
it's their fault.

1514
01:34:04,150 --> 01:34:06,400
And it's the other thing that's their
fault and it's the my team's fault.

1515
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:09,040
And it's a, and I, it's
not my fault. Yeah.

1516
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:12,860
Yeah. I mean, just to be clear though,

1517
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:17,390
that I'm not seeing the fault part of
it. The fault, the fault in the blaming,

1518
01:34:17,450 --> 01:34:19,550
that part of it literally
has nothing to do with it.

1519
01:34:20,090 --> 01:34:23,630
Are you saying caused an effect? There are
two different things. There's the look,

1520
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:28,670
put it this way. Look, okay. And I
said, kind of say this as a joke where,

1521
01:34:28,850 --> 01:34:32,780
I dunno, let's say I did something
right and then I'd be like, well,

1522
01:34:32,781 --> 01:34:36,230
it's not my fault. It's, um, you know,
my parent's fault for having me. Oh,

1523
01:34:36,231 --> 01:34:38,370
but it's their fault. There
are actually, it's great.

1524
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:42,200
My grandparents fault for having them. Oh
No, it's the, you know, my great grand,

1525
01:34:42,201 --> 01:34:42,740
you know,

1526
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:47,630
and you start just blaming every little
factor that contributed to this result.

1527
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:49,900
Every little factory. Right. Here's the,

1528
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:53,210
so basically to kind of break
that apart, it's like, yeah,

1529
01:34:53,211 --> 01:34:56,450
if my parents didn't have me,
this wouldn't have happened.
It's true. It's true.

1530
01:34:56,720 --> 01:35:01,720
But the thing is you can't just start
point blame as far as assigning blame

1531
01:35:02,001 --> 01:35:05,420
goes. I'm not assigning
blame if I'm saying, Hey,

1532
01:35:05,421 --> 01:35:08,810
this is a factory or whatever as
unless I'm doing it as a joke.

1533
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:10,760
You see what I'm saying?
Okay. So it's like, okay,

1534
01:35:10,761 --> 01:35:14,030
so if when you do cross the
line to start assigning blame,

1535
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:17,450
that's when you can't be like,
okay,

1536
01:35:17,451 --> 01:35:20,090
it's everything else that you've
got to blame yourself. But it,

1537
01:35:20,091 --> 01:35:21,530
let's say you're not assigning blame,

1538
01:35:21,531 --> 01:35:25,820
you're just maybe analyzing it from an
objective perspective. So what I'm saying,

1539
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:28,610
you can identify all kinds of causes,

1540
01:35:28,820 --> 01:35:33,540
all kinds of causes seem sane
and they're probably true. Okay.

1541
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:37,730
But not having anything to do with
causing bleeding or, or assigning blame,

1542
01:35:37,731 --> 01:35:41,990
we're saying who's fault it is. Same.
Same check. Okay. It's just, uh,

1543
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:47,720
another example of how like you or we,

1544
01:35:47,721 --> 01:35:49,610
whatever when I talked
to a lot of the time,

1545
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:54,710
sometimes all you will take a scenario
and I'll just sort of marvel at different

1546
01:35:54,711 --> 01:35:56,630
working parts of this scenario. Like, oh,

1547
01:35:56,631 --> 01:35:59,000
isn't it interesting how this
is this and this is this,

1548
01:35:59,001 --> 01:36:00,830
but you could do this and
look at it this way too,

1549
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:04,270
even though it has nothing to do with me,
you know?

1550
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:07,130
And it has nothing to do with any kind
of actions to be taken or nothing like

1551
01:36:07,131 --> 01:36:07,251
that.

1552
01:36:07,251 --> 01:36:11,570
It's essentially just analyzing the
scenario and being interested in it versus

1553
01:36:11,571 --> 01:36:15,470
you, you always look at the scenario
like, okay, yeah, cool, that's cool.

1554
01:36:15,471 --> 01:36:17,510
You analyze it, but what
do you do? You know,

1555
01:36:17,511 --> 01:36:21,230
your attitude is really a real take
action kind of kind of approach.

1556
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:25,640
So I think that's where I think
that's where we're getting some,

1557
01:36:26,930 --> 01:36:29,030
some misfires.
So what I'm saying,

1558
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:34,240
you think that it's like I want to base
some action to be taken upon the way I'm

1559
01:36:36,501 --> 01:36:39,520
looking at it when it requires no action,

1560
01:36:39,521 --> 01:36:43,580
it's just the way to sort of look at it,
you know? But if you want to take action,

1561
01:36:43,581 --> 01:36:44,900
like, okay, so who do we blame? That's,

1562
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:48,500
that's the beginning of taking
action in a way. Who Do we blame?

1563
01:36:48,590 --> 01:36:50,660
What do we got to fix?
Who Do we got to fix?

1564
01:36:50,661 --> 01:36:55,490
Whatever to move forward
to fix a situation, to, you
know, whatever. Rectify it.

1565
01:36:56,390 --> 01:36:57,380
Then you've got to be like,
okay,

1566
01:36:57,381 --> 01:37:01,760
I've got to identify the problem that I
can change. And then yeah, in that case,

1567
01:37:01,761 --> 01:37:06,440
then yeah, that problem's
going to be yourself. It's
the best way. And if it's not,

1568
01:37:06,441 --> 01:37:08,140
then you're not going to solve anything.
Yeah.

1569
01:37:08,450 --> 01:37:11,630
You just can't sit around and blame
people. Yeah. But does that make sense?

1570
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:18,190
Maybe I don't recommend it. No.

1571
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:22,160
Yeah, and that's the thing. Yeah.
And again, even that was saying,

1572
01:37:22,161 --> 01:37:25,970
I don't recommend it. That's like, that's
super indicative of just like, yeah,

1573
01:37:25,971 --> 01:37:28,070
you don't recommend that as
a problem solving technique.

1574
01:37:28,071 --> 01:37:31,250
That's a t that's an take
action approach right there.

1575
01:37:33,570 --> 01:37:34,403
See what I'm saying?

1576
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:39,110
It's kind of like if we
came to a stoplight and then
the stop lights red and I'm

1577
01:37:39,111 --> 01:37:42,140
like, wow, isn't that red
stoplight? Super Nice. Like,

1578
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:46,550
it's a beautiful color of red and
you're going to be like, yeah, like,

1579
01:37:46,790 --> 01:37:50,060
but it means to stop. So we're
stopped. I'm like, no, I know,

1580
01:37:50,090 --> 01:37:53,150
but isn't it kind of beautiful?
Then it turns green. Wow.

1581
01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:55,620
Isn't that a beautiful green light?

1582
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:59,760
And you were like, yeah, but it's,
it means to go. And I'm like, cool.

1583
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:03,150
But it's a pretty nice shade of green.
You see what I'm saying?

1584
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:05,680
See what I'm saying? It's like
two different perspectives. Yeah.

1585
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:09,110
And then of course he drove through
the green light and you know,

1586
01:38:09,510 --> 01:38:14,190
I had to go get after it. All
right, we'll leave that one at that.

1587
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:15,140
All right.
Um,

1588
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:21,000
obviously the attempts to save
Carl Pans Ram were ceased. And

1589
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:28,430
here's how his life and according
to this book at Leavenworth,

1590
01:38:30,090 --> 01:38:33,870
the lights of the isolation that burned
into a pale gray dawn, September 5th,

1591
01:38:33,871 --> 01:38:38,280
when pants ram heard the distant
distant rattle of footsteps.

1592
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:41,790
It was not quite six o'clock guard.

1593
01:38:42,030 --> 01:38:46,410
Bellard went over to the steel door
leading to an outer corridor and peered

1594
01:38:46,411 --> 01:38:49,170
through the small barred
window warden whites.

1595
01:38:49,171 --> 01:38:53,400
Voice was heard and the guard
turned a brass key in the lock.

1596
01:38:54,270 --> 01:38:55,380
The door swung open.

1597
01:38:55,590 --> 01:39:00,150
White entered the isolation at the head
of the procession of some 20 persons

1598
01:39:00,151 --> 01:39:02,280
including guards and newspaper reporters.

1599
01:39:02,580 --> 01:39:07,580
Immediately behind the warden was
Marshall McKeever of McKeever and the tall

1600
01:39:09,031 --> 01:39:12,930
government hang man carrying the
leather harness over one arm.

1601
01:39:14,220 --> 01:39:16,710
White stopped in front of pans,
rams cell.

1602
01:39:18,630 --> 01:39:22,200
The spectators press themselves discretely
against the opposite wall. It's pans.

1603
01:39:22,201 --> 01:39:26,640
Ram faced them searching through
the wire mesh with his hostile eyes.

1604
01:39:27,790 --> 01:39:28,350
Okay?

1605
01:39:28,350 --> 01:39:33,350
He saw two men in clerical garb on the
fringes of the crowd in a once began to

1606
01:39:33,691 --> 01:39:34,620
roar it white.

1607
01:39:35,690 --> 01:39:36,200
Okay.

1608
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:38,780
Are there any Bible backed
cock suckers in here?

1609
01:39:41,130 --> 01:39:43,800
I thought you might change your mind.
White apologized.

1610
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:48,990
These gentlemen came along. Way
To offer you comfort. Get 'em out.

1611
01:39:49,740 --> 01:39:52,230
Shouted Pants, Ram. I
don't mind being hanged,

1612
01:39:52,231 --> 01:39:56,280
but I don't need any Bible
back to hypocrites around
me. Run them out, warden,

1613
01:39:56,430 --> 01:39:59,670
or you'll have one hell of a
time getting me out of this cell.

1614
01:39:59,790 --> 01:40:02,340
Every man I get a hand on
his going to the hospital.

1615
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:04,900
Okay.

1616
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:05,711
White new pans.

1617
01:40:05,711 --> 01:40:10,711
Ram was within a condemned
man's traditional rights
regarding witnesses of his

1618
01:40:11,051 --> 01:40:12,250
own execution.

1619
01:40:13,580 --> 01:40:14,080
Yeah.

1620
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:18,810
The disappointed clergy men were
escorted out. All right, pants. Ram said.

1621
01:40:18,811 --> 01:40:21,120
Let's get going.
What are we stalling for?

1622
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:22,440
Okay.

1623
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:24,120
White motions.
The guards,

1624
01:40:24,121 --> 01:40:27,840
a newsman to proceed to the exercise
yard is Bollard opened pants,

1625
01:40:27,841 --> 01:40:30,330
ram sell pans.

1626
01:40:30,331 --> 01:40:34,200
Ram helped as escorts faster
the fast and the leather corset.

1627
01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:39,660
Anything you want to say? Ask The
hangmen. Fumbling with a strap pans.

1628
01:40:39,661 --> 01:40:44,010
Ram snapped impatiently. Yes.
Hurried up. You. Who's your bastard?

1629
01:40:44,370 --> 01:40:46,800
I could hang a dozen men
while you're fooling around.

1630
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:49,080
Okay.

1631
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:53,070
In the yard, the newsman took hurried
notes. The scaffold looked strange.

1632
01:40:53,170 --> 01:40:54,520
Somehow unexpected.

1633
01:40:54,730 --> 01:40:59,590
Do glistened on the boards that had
the raw temporary look of a structure

1634
01:40:59,591 --> 01:41:01,090
erected for a county fair.

1635
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:03,020
Yeah.

1636
01:41:03,020 --> 01:41:06,470
In less than a minute, the backdoor
of the isolation opened and pans.

1637
01:41:06,471 --> 01:41:09,800
Ram was emerged between
Ballard and the hang man pans.

1638
01:41:09,801 --> 01:41:14,660
Ram was almost running ahead, half
dragging the taller, his taller escorts,

1639
01:41:14,870 --> 01:41:17,000
white and the Marshall Hurry behind,

1640
01:41:17,030 --> 01:41:20,060
trailed by officer's trying
to look dignified as they ran.

1641
01:41:21,660 --> 01:41:22,220
Okay.

1642
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:26,360
And the confusion the spectators parted
into two lines as they per session.

1643
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:29,480
As the procession raised pell
mell and their direction pans,

1644
01:41:29,481 --> 01:41:33,920
rams face was rigid and look straight
ahead. His eyes fixed on the rope.

1645
01:41:34,940 --> 01:41:35,250
Okay.

1646
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:39,300
Only at the foot of the stairs did he
seem to notice the transfixed onlookers.

1647
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:43,410
He paused,
look slowly around and spat twice

1648
01:41:44,980 --> 01:41:46,390
that his face was forward again.

1649
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:51,100
Everyone's nostrils inhaled the sweet
smell of new oak and hemp and everyone's

1650
01:41:51,101 --> 01:41:54,850
eyes followed him up the 13 steps
which he felt with his feet.

1651
01:41:56,400 --> 01:42:01,400
He hurried up the gallows as toward the
gate pulling Ballard and the hang man

1652
01:42:02,611 --> 01:42:03,444
with him.

1653
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:08,170
Reporters who had witnessed
this event were surprised by it.

1654
01:42:08,171 --> 01:42:12,600
Swiftness and their accounts were in
conflict as to the time and exact detail.

1655
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:14,130
Okay.

1656
01:42:14,130 --> 01:42:15,990
There was uncertainty as to whether pans,

1657
01:42:15,991 --> 01:42:19,020
Ram and been able to spit on the
executioner as he had promised.

1658
01:42:19,021 --> 01:42:23,730
He would the reporter's notebooks hide
hung limp during the swift adjustment of

1659
01:42:23,731 --> 01:42:24,480
the rope.

1660
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:28,680
The exploding sound of the opening doors
and the swift downward stroke of the

1661
01:42:28,681 --> 01:42:29,514
body.

1662
01:42:30,490 --> 01:42:31,323
Yeah.

1663
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:35,400
Later they recalled the mist which had
settled on the yard and the indistinct

1664
01:42:35,401 --> 01:42:38,190
figures of guards watching
from a tower on the wall.

1665
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:41,080
The prison had been quiet.

1666
01:42:41,410 --> 01:42:44,500
The first bell was not yet
scheduled to ring for an hour.

1667
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:47,960
Reporters had left the same way.

1668
01:42:47,961 --> 01:42:52,550
They came in and were relieved to
find themselves outside the walls.

1669
01:42:55,550 --> 01:42:59,900
Records of official entry regarding
the death of Carl Pans, Ram, our brief,

1670
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:02,150
Dr Justin Kay Fuller,

1671
01:43:02,330 --> 01:43:06,290
one of the two doctors and attendants
step forward and to the stretch body

1672
01:43:06,350 --> 01:43:07,490
underneath the gallows,

1673
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:11,630
placed a stethoscope gently on
the chest and palputated the neck.

1674
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:13,000
Yeah.

1675
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,420
Later he dictated his
report to a prison clerk.

1676
01:43:17,660 --> 01:43:18,493
Okay.

1677
01:43:18,550 --> 01:43:22,090
Medical certificate of
death. Carl pants. Ram.

1678
01:43:22,390 --> 01:43:26,710
I hereby certify that I examined the
body of Carl Pans Ram in accordance with

1679
01:43:26,711 --> 01:43:30,370
the directions of the surgeon general
of the US public health service and

1680
01:43:30,371 --> 01:43:33,550
attorney general at us
penitentiary Leavenworth,

1681
01:43:33,551 --> 01:43:36,100
Kansas on September 5th,

1682
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:39,250
1930 and pronounced him dead at 6:18 AM

1683
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:41,290
okay.

1684
01:43:41,290 --> 01:43:45,820
I found the cause of death to be
dislocation, cervical vertebra,

1685
01:43:46,860 --> 01:43:50,950
strangulation,
legal execution,

1686
01:43:54,650 --> 01:43:59,650
and so ended the life of Carl Pans Ram

1687
01:44:04,510 --> 01:44:08,840
on September 5th,
1930 and while pans,

1688
01:44:08,841 --> 01:44:09,770
Ram died,

1689
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:14,300
evil as we see certainly
did not die with him.

1690
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:21,790
It's still walks among us today.

1691
01:44:27,130 --> 01:44:30,620
And as we've been going back and forth on,

1692
01:44:30,670 --> 01:44:32,190
I obviously pans.

1693
01:44:32,191 --> 01:44:36,480
Ram did not get many benefits in life,

1694
01:44:40,790 --> 01:44:44,030
but that does not excuse his actions.

1695
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:50,800
And we are responsible for what we do.

1696
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:53,470
We are responsible for our lives.

1697
01:44:53,471 --> 01:44:57,700
And if someone's had a
horrible things happen to them,

1698
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,630
if they've seen horrible things,
if they've done horrible things,

1699
01:45:05,570 --> 01:45:08,870
it's still important
that you don't be calm.

1700
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:14,020
Those horrible things that you don't
propagate those horrible things.

1701
01:45:18,270 --> 01:45:19,103
Okay?

1702
01:45:19,180 --> 01:45:23,620
Instead
be the hero,

1703
01:45:23,621 --> 01:45:27,100
be the savior that absorbs those things,

1704
01:45:27,250 --> 01:45:30,430
those horrible things and passes on good.

1705
01:45:34,630 --> 01:45:35,760
And you do that.

1706
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:42,580
You do that by Pete treating people with
respect and being kind to other human

1707
01:45:43,801 --> 01:45:44,634
beings.

1708
01:45:48,330 --> 01:45:49,163
Okay?

1709
01:45:49,580 --> 01:45:54,020
And it's, it's one of those things that
I've thought about this one character,

1710
01:45:54,130 --> 01:45:55,340
this does Henry Lesser.

1711
01:45:55,341 --> 01:45:59,090
This guard is the first person
that that pans ram ever fought.

1712
01:45:59,091 --> 01:46:03,590
Did something nice to him. And who
knows if that had happened earlier,

1713
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:05,030
maybe could have been a

1714
01:46:07,070 --> 01:46:10,640
teacher at the state school.

1715
01:46:13,090 --> 01:46:16,510
Maybe that's what tips someone

1716
01:46:18,850 --> 01:46:19,900
towards the good.

1717
01:46:20,850 --> 01:46:21,683
Okay.

1718
01:46:22,170 --> 01:46:23,390
You know,
are you that person?

1719
01:46:23,391 --> 01:46:27,530
Can you be that person that's sways
someone from doing evil deeds,

1720
01:46:27,770 --> 01:46:31,010
doing good simply
crew,

1721
01:46:31,011 --> 01:46:35,360
some sympathetic words,
some compassionate gesture.

1722
01:46:39,780 --> 01:46:42,000
Think about that.
Might be that person.

1723
01:46:46,550 --> 01:46:51,090
I might be that person.
We be that person

1724
01:46:52,650 --> 01:46:53,730
that sets the good example

1725
01:46:56,870 --> 01:46:59,570
by being nice,
by being kind.

1726
01:47:02,710 --> 01:47:05,140
And here's the dichotomy.
At the same time,

1727
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:11,520
you gotta be strong enough to stand up
to people that think might makes right.

1728
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:20,300
You gotta be strong enough to
face the malevolent force of evil.

1729
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:25,153
Yeah.

1730
01:47:25,750 --> 01:47:28,300
And you have to recognize

1731
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:33,220
that that is everywhere.

1732
01:47:34,930 --> 01:47:35,763
Yeah.

1733
01:47:37,270 --> 01:47:40,900
That's say tannic force that is waiting

1734
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:44,940
to prey on the weak.

1735
01:47:50,230 --> 01:47:52,830
And if we don't fight it,
the net force has got to win.

1736
01:47:56,710 --> 01:47:57,543
Yeah.

1737
01:47:57,900 --> 01:48:01,530
So we
cannot stand down.

1738
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:06,353
Hey Tom,

1739
01:48:07,810 --> 01:48:11,440
I think that's all I've got for tonight.

1740
01:48:13,300 --> 01:48:16,710
Kind of a rough one.
Yes.

1741
01:48:22,300 --> 01:48:25,570
When you think about it, this
is like, this is pretty psycho,

1742
01:48:25,630 --> 01:48:29,140
like pretty psychotic.
Safeway's evil for sure.

1743
01:48:29,830 --> 01:48:34,090
But I dunno if it was just
the way he, it is the, it is.

1744
01:48:34,091 --> 01:48:37,750
I do know it's the way
he presented it was like,

1745
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:41,860
it wasn't like as tragic is,

1746
01:48:42,950 --> 01:48:47,290
I don't know the other stuff that, that
I've heard, let me take a part of it.

1747
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:52,300
He wrote it and he became
humanized in your head.

1748
01:48:53,860 --> 01:48:58,860
So you were listening to him talk and
you were sympathizing with him and you

1749
01:48:59,381 --> 01:49:03,760
were understanding the harshness that
he went through and you were completely

1750
01:49:03,761 --> 01:49:08,620
detached and not, you didn't humanize
any of the victims at all, right?

1751
01:49:08,710 --> 01:49:12,070
Yes. That's what it was opposite of the
beginning when I'm talking about this

1752
01:49:12,071 --> 01:49:16,570
beautiful girl Luisa. Yes. From what
she went, you know, you understood her.

1753
01:49:16,630 --> 01:49:19,010
Go watch some of the videos of that girl.
Yeah.

1754
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:24,690
You're such a nice person. Yeah.
Like just like an angel. Yeah.

1755
01:49:24,910 --> 01:49:28,660
And that's what you relate to.
So as a, as a person yourself,

1756
01:49:28,661 --> 01:49:29,860
as a human being yourself,

1757
01:49:29,890 --> 01:49:33,130
it's very easy for you to get
three to humanize someone, right.

1758
01:49:33,170 --> 01:49:34,900
If you listen to crawl in room,
used to be here,

1759
01:49:34,901 --> 01:49:36,940
what he's been through and he's telling
it from his perspective and all these

1760
01:49:36,941 --> 01:49:39,550
tiny little 11 year old boy,
you don't know anything about that boy.

1761
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:44,810
Just some arbitrary arbitrary
thing doesn't even barely
exist. It's a word. Yeah.

1762
01:49:44,830 --> 01:49:48,220
Boy. That's all it is. Yeah.
But it's not. It's not.

1763
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:53,230
It's a little kid. That's a little
kid. Yeah, that's exactly it.

1764
01:49:53,290 --> 01:49:56,080
That's exactly what it was.
You're going through his struggles.

1765
01:49:56,081 --> 01:49:58,870
Ensure he's not print
well. Yeah. And you know,

1766
01:49:58,871 --> 01:50:01,960
he's talking about his anger and everyone
did sorry. And you're like, Dang,

1767
01:50:01,961 --> 01:50:06,010
Okay Bang. That's, you know, he's, he's
a mad guy and sure I'm not, you know,

1768
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:07,710
I'm not siding with him,
but it's,

1769
01:50:07,730 --> 01:50:11,260
it's more like you're just getting it
from his Pr, his perspective, you know,

1770
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:15,160
then he dies in your life. Well, you
deserved it. Yeah. Yeah. But if, yeah,

1771
01:50:15,161 --> 01:50:19,150
if they'd told that the whole story
of like, I dunno, any one of them new,

1772
01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:23,410
one of those victims will be like,
Dang man, this is heavy. It's dark.

1773
01:50:24,010 --> 01:50:28,890
Any sorta like, he didn't go into any kind
of graphic detail, you'd just be like,

1774
01:50:28,891 --> 01:50:32,080
oh, I commuted, sought him. In fact, I was
like, Bro, how are you even doing that?

1775
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:35,560
You're just like, just sorta committed,
tried to commit. Like how do you do that?

1776
01:50:35,590 --> 01:50:39,040
You know, you just, hey, come here, let
me commit sodomy on you. I mean, I dunno.

1777
01:50:39,370 --> 01:50:43,840
He made it sound like 200 pound
dude against an 11 year old boy.

1778
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:47,800
Yeah. But even like the, you know, his
inmates or whatever, then everyone,

1779
01:50:47,801 --> 01:50:52,300
he was just the, and the point is there,
he just sorta, he's preying on the weak.

1780
01:50:52,301 --> 01:50:56,010
He says all the time, he's just
picking a guy that's 132 pounds. Yeah.

1781
01:50:56,920 --> 01:51:01,900
But yeah, and just 200 pounds.
Yeah. Six feet. 200 yeah.

1782
01:51:01,901 --> 01:51:06,370
You know, he was, I don't know
what the, what the deal is,

1783
01:51:06,670 --> 01:51:08,440
but like where I grew up in New England,

1784
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:13,180
the houses like the ceilings are lower
and the doors are smaller because people

1785
01:51:13,181 --> 01:51:17,320
were smaller. Yeah. Back in the day,
and this is a hundred years ago,

1786
01:51:18,730 --> 01:51:20,860
but we're born ever 90 years ago.

1787
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:25,150
But people are a little bit smaller,
you know,

1788
01:51:25,210 --> 01:51:29,680
so him at six foot one 90 is
kinda like a yoke to dude.

1789
01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:32,560
Yeah. Plus with all that, you know,

1790
01:51:32,860 --> 01:51:37,510
years of hard labor in an 18 pound
hammer. Yeah. You know, he was strong.

1791
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:40,930
Yeah. But he just sorta breezes
over it though. You know,

1792
01:51:40,990 --> 01:51:44,500
there's no graphic details. Just sorta.
Yeah. It just committed some bad crimes,

1793
01:51:44,530 --> 01:51:44,741
you know?

1794
01:51:44,741 --> 01:51:49,741
So that's why it's always good to think
about the perspective of the other

1795
01:51:50,231 --> 01:51:51,610
people.
Yeah.

1796
01:51:55,470 --> 01:51:59,530
It's crazy, man. It's crazy. But you know,

1797
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:02,080
and yeah, he could have, he should have,

1798
01:52:02,380 --> 01:52:05,290
he should have chosen a path is what he
should've done. Like how you said, yeah,

1799
01:52:05,291 --> 01:52:06,280
he said that. Right. Well,

1800
01:52:06,340 --> 01:52:09,500
more important I think because you're
going to have some people out there that

1801
01:52:09,501 --> 01:52:12,730
are going to choose the wrong path.
They're not, they're not going to go,

1802
01:52:13,570 --> 01:52:15,340
they're not going to
go in a good direction.

1803
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:20,760
And that's why it's important
to be prepared mentally
and physically to stand up

1804
01:52:22,721 --> 01:52:25,090
and face that man. It's true. You got to,

1805
01:52:27,370 --> 01:52:31,300
speaking of which, take some
Jujitsu. I'll tell you right now,

1806
01:52:31,301 --> 01:52:32,170
you take some Jujitsu,

1807
01:52:32,171 --> 01:52:36,760
you really decrease the probability
of anyone attempting sodomy on you.

1808
01:52:36,761 --> 01:52:41,690
Yes. It is a big help. Reduce, reduce. Um,

1809
01:52:42,070 --> 01:52:46,130
anyway, what that means is
we're going to, regardless of

1810
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:49,400
our, our, our, what we're
trying to defend ourselves from

1811
01:52:50,660 --> 01:52:55,100
Jujitsu versus evil. That's what
I'm saying. Yes. It helps you.

1812
01:52:55,250 --> 01:52:57,860
Yes. You need all your
tools to fight against evil.

1813
01:52:57,940 --> 01:53:00,700
Yeah. Big Time. There's evil
in the world. Confirmed. Yeah.

1814
01:53:00,701 --> 01:53:05,200
Fully live evil in the world right now.
Friesen crazy.

1815
01:53:05,380 --> 01:53:10,380
Every once in a while I'll flash it will
flash in my mind how valuable Jujitsu

1816
01:53:11,350 --> 01:53:13,990
is. Like if you, if
someone said, hey you can,

1817
01:53:14,350 --> 01:53:16,780
you can never go to the beach ever again

1818
01:53:18,490 --> 01:53:22,930
or you can never do to get to a fair
again. See what I'm saying? Oh you,

1819
01:53:22,931 --> 01:53:24,310
you might have some issues.

1820
01:53:25,290 --> 01:53:28,590
No, I just think that's funny how like
the two biggest things you can put on the

1821
01:53:29,380 --> 01:53:32,400
beach in Jujitsu,
just saying you got to give up one

1822
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:36,510
beach isn't even on my list.
I mean all doesn't to go surfing,

1823
01:53:36,690 --> 01:53:40,540
but were just going to the beach for
you as a thing. For me, it's not really,

1824
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:45,390
oh yeah. Well put it this way, like I pry,

1825
01:53:45,391 --> 01:53:49,560
could I trade a, I'd give up a
lot to keep Jujitsu if it was,

1826
01:53:50,300 --> 01:53:51,133
here's something,

1827
01:53:53,310 --> 01:53:56,790
if you know some Jujitsu,
if you know some Jiu Jitsu,

1828
01:53:56,791 --> 01:53:59,220
if you know more of Jujitsu than
most other people around you,

1829
01:53:59,250 --> 01:54:03,110
that's a real beneficial
thing. Yeah, can you,

1830
01:54:03,900 --> 01:54:07,860
and it's funny because if you don't know
anything, you're a little bit ignorant.

1831
01:54:07,890 --> 01:54:10,680
In fact, you're in a Latte, right? And
you don't even know what you don't know.

1832
01:54:10,681 --> 01:54:14,520
And so you're sitting in, you're, you're
walking across a parking lot, right?

1833
01:54:14,900 --> 01:54:18,630
And it's 10 o'clock at night when someone
comes to bother you and you think in

1834
01:54:18,631 --> 01:54:22,140
your mind like, oh, just do this and
this and you don't know anything.

1835
01:54:22,770 --> 01:54:26,400
It's a complete,
it's a complete whole in your game.

1836
01:54:26,490 --> 01:54:29,670
And the game of life is what I'm talking
about. They gave him a life. If it is,

1837
01:54:29,970 --> 01:54:32,880
if you know Jujitsu and you're walking
across 10 o'clock at night and someone's

1838
01:54:32,881 --> 01:54:36,690
going to give you a problem, you
actually know what to do. Yeah. And,

1839
01:54:36,750 --> 01:54:41,190
and the person that doesn't
know anything there, so bar

1840
01:54:42,210 --> 01:54:45,540
just behind,
it's crazy.

1841
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:48,330
I remember in college where,

1842
01:54:48,390 --> 01:54:53,070
and I knew how to do a rear naked choke
and like, you know, just from watching UFC

1843
01:54:55,290 --> 01:54:57,300
never trained to actual Jujitsu class.

1844
01:54:57,301 --> 01:54:59,950
But I remember in college I got
into this like fight, right.

1845
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:03,600
And we ended up not fighting,
fighting, but you know,

1846
01:55:03,601 --> 01:55:07,020
the kind that we started to fight,
but it was nothing.

1847
01:55:07,021 --> 01:55:09,870
You know what it was it a
friend? No. Okay. He was like,

1848
01:55:10,170 --> 01:55:13,590
was it a known person
or just a total random,

1849
01:55:13,980 --> 01:55:17,750
he was like at a party scenario.
No, I didn't know. Um, and,

1850
01:55:19,190 --> 01:55:21,810
and you know, whatever, it doesn't matter
what, how he got broken up, whatever.

1851
01:55:21,811 --> 01:55:23,790
And we continued our lives.

1852
01:55:24,390 --> 01:55:29,390
But right now I'm thinking back
to like how much I didn't know.

1853
01:55:29,461 --> 01:55:31,890
Like what was I even thinking like,
Whoa,

1854
01:55:31,891 --> 01:55:35,760
was I going to do just sort of throw
punches, you know, or something like this.

1855
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:36,370
Like what?

1856
01:55:36,370 --> 01:55:40,540
Like even when you do get in a fight
and you don't really know any especially

1857
01:55:40,570 --> 01:55:42,270
need you to do, it's like
man, you just sort of,

1858
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:47,300
it's sort of a shoot really
compared to if you know Jujitsu,

1859
01:55:47,461 --> 01:55:51,300
it's not a crap shoot. It's like, oh, I'm
going to either decide to do whatever.

1860
01:55:51,301 --> 01:55:54,480
I want pennant thing to
this person if you want to,

1861
01:55:54,570 --> 01:55:57,840
if you don't train Jujitsu and
you want to know what it's like,

1862
01:55:58,420 --> 01:56:00,870
picture anything that you
actually know how to do.

1863
01:56:01,740 --> 01:56:06,740
Like shoot a basketball
or play basketball.

1864
01:56:07,530 --> 01:56:10,970
Yeah. And picture someone that never
played before playing against you.

1865
01:56:11,430 --> 01:56:12,720
That's what's going to happen.
Yeah.

1866
01:56:12,780 --> 01:56:16,740
If you don't know anything
or like say go find someone.

1867
01:56:16,741 --> 01:56:20,610
If you ever can find someone who doesn't
know how to ride a bike or a skateboard.

1868
01:56:20,870 --> 01:56:23,700
Yes. Not everyone knows how to ride
a skateboard but a bike and say, hey,

1869
01:56:23,701 --> 01:56:26,910
let's race to the end of the block on
this bike and that person doesn't even

1870
01:56:26,911 --> 01:56:28,520
know how to write it.
They never been on a bike before.

1871
01:56:28,830 --> 01:56:32,730
They have zero chance of it. Btu
I know. Brett's like that. Anyway,

1872
01:56:33,820 --> 01:56:36,810
so train some Jujitsu, train some. As
you get to go take some classes. Brad,

1873
01:56:36,811 --> 01:56:39,360
just go ahead and go learn how
to ride that bike right now.

1874
01:56:39,540 --> 01:56:43,830
Right now in America you can train
Jujitsu and so many different places.

1875
01:56:43,831 --> 01:56:48,020
It's amazing. Yeah, it is very amazing.
There's amazing places to train Jujitsu.

1876
01:56:48,090 --> 01:56:51,780
So go train some Jujitsu.
Yeah, and when you do,

1877
01:56:51,781 --> 01:56:55,650
so you want to do geek end Nogi so
when you get a g, what Geeta we get,

1878
01:56:55,651 --> 01:56:59,000
we all know if you don't already origins,

1879
01:56:59,060 --> 01:57:03,270
you go to origin may.com I got
a rash guards on there as well.

1880
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:08,460
Joggers as well. Shirts,
supplements, supplements,

1881
01:57:08,461 --> 01:57:12,690
of course. And that's a good one to wear.
And I took your advice, you know. Okay.

1882
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:16,260
Remember I told you like Oh yeah a I
didn't take joint warfare for like a few

1883
01:57:16,261 --> 01:57:19,290
days. And you're like, what?
Why not other? Cause they
just don't, I don't know,

1884
01:57:19,291 --> 01:57:21,840
I forgot or whatever.
Here's the thing,

1885
01:57:21,841 --> 01:57:26,841
I admitted something to myself sometimes
when I didn't back then and when I

1886
01:57:26,881 --> 01:57:31,200
didn't take it. It's not that I
forgot, it's just that I'd be like,

1887
01:57:31,201 --> 01:57:34,440
oh I'll take one tomorrow or
something. I'm like, I'm literally,

1888
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:39,270
I was literally too lazy to just go in
the pantry right here. Not by the way,

1889
01:57:39,271 --> 01:57:41,700
like three, four feet away. Get it,

1890
01:57:41,730 --> 01:57:45,210
open it up in your routine now bro.
Yes.

1891
01:57:45,211 --> 01:57:47,250
And this is how I put it into
my routine and I was like,

1892
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:51,390
there's no way I'm going to be able to
accept the fact that I'm too lazy to

1893
01:57:51,391 --> 01:57:55,850
spend literally 20 seconds
literally and you know,

1894
01:57:56,630 --> 01:58:00,200
and take some pills.
It's like no way I can accept that,

1895
01:58:00,440 --> 01:58:01,760
that I'm not trapped in your brand.

1896
01:58:04,210 --> 01:58:07,170
I'm kind of am I guess a little
bit for at least two hours a week.

1897
01:58:07,171 --> 01:58:08,640
I'm a little bit trapped in your brand.

1898
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:11,850
Well you're the one who's correcting
it because I'm like no way.

1899
01:58:12,150 --> 01:58:13,050
Cause you're like,
dude,

1900
01:58:13,051 --> 01:58:16,680
just do it in your routine and you make
it sound so easy cause it doesn't feel

1901
01:58:16,681 --> 01:58:20,220
that easy. But then I'm thinking
like, wait, it is that easy. Really.

1902
01:58:20,310 --> 01:58:23,850
I'm just not allowing it to put it
by your toothbrush or whatever. No,

1903
01:58:23,870 --> 01:58:28,590
I keep it in the pantry. Brow 15 seconds.
Oh, but you just do it. Just do it.

1904
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:33,150
Yeah. Do a little extra.
Very little extra. Anyway.

1905
01:58:33,750 --> 01:58:38,370
Check joint warfare. Krill oil. These
are the ones that I'm talking about.

1906
01:58:38,380 --> 01:58:42,340
Desert in my routine every single
day. Joints, all situations

1907
01:58:42,410 --> 01:58:46,510
to discipline, which if you don't know,
we have a new flavor of discipline out.

1908
01:58:47,110 --> 01:58:48,430
It's called Tropic Thunder.

1909
01:58:50,010 --> 01:58:53,110
I got mine and let's,

1910
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:57,490
let's be real and let's be
honest, what it, what it is,

1911
01:58:58,730 --> 01:59:00,110
peanut peanut Colada,

1912
01:59:01,900 --> 01:59:05,640
but I couldn't have something out
there called bt or Gelada. Come on man.

1913
01:59:05,970 --> 01:59:10,890
Tropic Thunder. Isn't that a movie? Late
baboons? Favorite movie of all time?

1914
01:59:10,891 --> 01:59:14,580
No, actually I don't, but it's right up
there. They've quotes that movie a lot.

1915
01:59:15,120 --> 01:59:17,310
I'm going to tell you, I'm going to
tell you right here, I haven't seen it.

1916
01:59:17,490 --> 01:59:18,510
You haven't seen tropic thunder.

1917
01:59:18,540 --> 01:59:22,370
That's definitely a movie that is so
I think Robert Downey Jr, right? Yeah,

1918
01:59:22,380 --> 01:59:25,910
but the most important character
in there is Tom Cruise's character.

1919
01:59:26,330 --> 01:59:28,670
He's really,
really funny.

1920
01:59:29,750 --> 01:59:33,050
Less good man I think is his name.
And anyways,

1921
01:59:33,350 --> 01:59:38,330
so we couldn't call it in clear conscious,
we couldn't call it Pina Colada.

1922
01:59:38,360 --> 01:59:41,900
That's just wrong, right? No, not
happening. It's an alcoholic beverage.

1923
01:59:41,901 --> 01:59:46,850
We're not doing it. It's kind of a
kind of a foo foo. Is that a good word?

1924
01:59:47,450 --> 01:59:52,450
Kind of a food foods like you ever been
to an Italian restaurant or like where

1925
01:59:53,481 --> 01:59:57,230
they, where it's real. It's
real nice. It's too nice.

1926
01:59:57,910 --> 01:59:59,540
Like they don't have like,

1927
02:00:00,530 --> 02:00:04,100
hey can I just get some chicken Parmesan
over here and when they bring you some

1928
02:00:04,101 --> 02:00:04,341
food,

1929
02:00:04,341 --> 02:00:09,341
it's really small and it has like a
long like name in a different language.

1930
02:00:11,210 --> 02:00:14,150
But you know I'm came be put
extras on the name, you know,

1931
02:00:14,530 --> 02:00:19,050
you know fresh clot from the Appalachian,
Blah Blah Blah. In the title.

1932
02:00:19,610 --> 02:00:23,010
It's like that came but there's never
very much food. The longer the title,

1933
02:00:23,011 --> 02:00:25,740
the less food you're going to get.
That's a good rule.

1934
02:00:26,470 --> 02:00:31,350
So couldn't go Pina Colada to Fufu.
We went tropic thunder for Leif Babin.

1935
02:00:31,430 --> 02:00:33,360
You didn't get as tropic
thunder on it was pretty hot.

1936
02:00:33,660 --> 02:00:37,050
And then don't forget about
moke which additional protein?

1937
02:00:37,051 --> 02:00:41,040
Additional protein and slash dessert.
Yeah.

1938
02:00:41,460 --> 02:00:45,770
Because it will fulfill
your dessert desire. Yeah.

1939
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:47,670
When you get done with the ribeye steak,

1940
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:50,430
so what's the game like when you,
you know when you're going to,

1941
02:00:50,720 --> 02:00:55,140
when you lift weights to elicit gains,
you have to have a [inaudible] with a z

1942
02:00:58,550 --> 02:01:01,460
you got to eat what,
certain amount of protein or yeah,

1943
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:06,090
it's like 0.7 or 1.6 or just one gram.

1944
02:01:06,210 --> 02:01:11,130
Yeah. But here's actually what I
learned with one grab any protein,

1945
02:01:11,131 --> 02:01:16,080
like any macro, they eat too much
of get to turn into fat and protein.

1946
02:01:16,081 --> 02:01:20,250
Proteins in kits turns to sugar
first from what I understand.

1947
02:01:20,251 --> 02:01:24,510
So you can't eat too much protein
is I usually too much protein?

1948
02:01:24,511 --> 02:01:28,920
If you're going like two grams
per body weight per pound, right.

1949
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:32,870
What about nine grams per bottle per
pound of body weight? I think that's fine.

1950
02:01:35,020 --> 02:01:38,630
Here's a good way to do it. So in
the morning I make a Omelet, right?

1951
02:01:38,680 --> 02:01:39,590
With egg whites

1952
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:44,450
and the good protein, clean,
whatever, some of the best.

1953
02:01:44,470 --> 02:01:46,880
But when you kind of,
if you're starting,

1954
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:50,210
which I kind of started to measure
these things or keep track of, okay,

1955
02:01:50,211 --> 02:01:52,130
how many cal I am,
I really [inaudible] whatever.

1956
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:55,730
So I realize there's not that
much protein in a regular size,

1957
02:01:55,731 --> 02:01:58,760
even a double size egg
white omelet with no cheese.

1958
02:01:58,860 --> 02:02:01,760
And so boom,

1959
02:02:01,790 --> 02:02:06,790
you make your egg white Omelette
train going on the side,

1960
02:02:07,041 --> 02:02:11,870
make your milkshake boom, perfect. Oh
milkshake, perfect amount of protein,

1961
02:02:12,050 --> 02:02:14,360
cheese. What I'm saying, if
in fact you're into, you know,

1962
02:02:14,510 --> 02:02:16,550
getting stronger and what not.

1963
02:02:17,210 --> 02:02:20,690
And on top of that we
got warrior kid milk,

1964
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:26,440
which is basically going to take over
all milk drinks for children in the very

1965
02:02:29,991 --> 02:02:34,110
short period of time because everyone
wants their kid to be healthy. Yeah.

1966
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:38,330
The kid wants to be healthy and strong
and the kid wants something that tastes

1967
02:02:38,390 --> 02:02:42,260
absolutely amazing. So there you
go. Where your kid milk. Yeah.

1968
02:02:42,510 --> 02:02:44,240
Remember like back in the day,

1969
02:02:44,241 --> 02:02:47,570
what was the fruit Hawaiian
Punch or was that only in Hawaii

1970
02:02:49,820 --> 02:02:53,940
Hawaiian Punch back tasted like,
hey, our English muffins. Oh

1971
02:02:57,830 --> 02:03:01,940
actually you can just, muffins aren't in
England. It's not a British thing. Yeah,

1972
02:03:01,941 --> 02:03:04,010
just like French fries aren't and friends,
right.

1973
02:03:04,390 --> 02:03:08,960
I don't they call them like palm
treat something else French anyway.

1974
02:03:09,020 --> 02:03:09,853
You know what I'm saying?

1975
02:03:10,060 --> 02:03:14,750
You used to drink the Hawaiian Punch
when you're little mouth. I'll read.

1976
02:03:14,751 --> 02:03:19,230
Tasted pretty good. Yeah. Well
it's a super strong. Yeah, but bro,

1977
02:03:19,231 --> 02:03:24,160
you can't be giving your kids that
like now with no knowledge. Really.

1978
02:03:24,161 --> 02:03:27,140
It's chilled child abuse.
And it's not just that these,

1979
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:32,000
these regular chocolate milk. What is
that? It's just corn syrup in milk.

1980
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:36,740
Yeah. That's all it is. And
chocolate and chocolate and sugar.

1981
02:03:37,220 --> 02:03:41,990
But we get kid warrior kid
more. Guess what? You're
making them stronger, smarter,

1982
02:03:42,110 --> 02:03:42,943
faster,

1983
02:03:43,640 --> 02:03:48,110
better and it tastes good and it tastes
delicious because kids don't want to

1984
02:03:48,111 --> 02:03:51,680
drink something that tastes like crap.
No, they don't drink something tasty.

1985
02:03:51,681 --> 02:03:54,860
So yeah, we're your kid walk all
that stuff that we just talked about.

1986
02:03:54,890 --> 02:03:59,000
Is that origin main.com if you want
to set porch, that's a good stuff.

1987
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:02,810
All American made throw that in
there like it's a no big deal. Yeah,

1988
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:07,280
go watch some of the videos of,
of looms being remade.

1989
02:04:07,820 --> 02:04:08,653
It's good.

1990
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:13,370
Also if you want to represent while
on the path Jocko was a store.

1991
02:04:13,430 --> 02:04:16,730
It's called Jocko store,
so you got a chocolate store.com.

1992
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:20,860
This is where you can get shirts and
whatnot. Discipline equals freedom. Sure.

1993
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:26,150
T shirts, rash guards, plenty, right?
Yes. Other rash guards on their truckers.

1994
02:04:26,151 --> 02:04:30,430
Hats or
flex for the hats?

1995
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:34,570
Whichever one you want. Whichever we
are. I like to flip flex it. I'm putting,

1996
02:04:34,590 --> 02:04:39,360
I'm going to put a bunch of new stuff
on there. A bunch of 20, 19. It's 2019,

1997
02:04:39,361 --> 02:04:42,920
by the way. Happy new year
brother. Thanks for it.

1998
02:04:43,590 --> 02:04:47,110
Isn't it funny like I felt like you felt
kind of uncomfortable telling me happy.

1999
02:04:48,140 --> 02:04:51,060
Kind of like, it's too like
sentimental. Hey, happy new year bro.

2000
02:04:53,360 --> 02:04:57,780
We all work to do. Let's go
focus. All right. New Year.

2001
02:04:57,810 --> 02:05:02,610
New gooey there. You know
how they say new year new me.

2002
02:05:02,970 --> 02:05:07,080
You got it. I saw, I saw that on
Twitter I think. Anyway. Um, oh yeah.

2003
02:05:07,081 --> 02:05:11,690
I'm going to put a bunch of new stuff
there for this year. Okay, cool. Uh,

2004
02:05:12,030 --> 02:05:16,800
you can also get Jocko white tea that
comes in either a regular tea form,

2005
02:05:16,830 --> 02:05:21,660
like I'm drinking with tea bags or the
can form like echo is drinking with the

2006
02:05:21,661 --> 02:05:22,494
can.

2007
02:05:22,770 --> 02:05:27,180
And the good thing about it is it's the
only beverage in the history of world

2008
02:05:27,181 --> 02:05:32,181
that's guaranteed 100% to give you an
8,000 pound dead lift that's 8,000 pounds.

So annoying. Okay. Just to this
part, the warrior kid podcasts,

2011

from Uncle Jake.
So do that.

2014
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:56,130
And then don't forget about
your warrior kids soap.

2015
02:05:56,520 --> 02:06:00,600
And it's not soap for warrior kids.
It's soap made by a warrior kid. Aiden,

2016
02:06:00,820 --> 02:06:05,820
who's got his own
business@irishoaksranch.com.

2017
02:06:07,250 --> 02:06:11,010
Uh,
what's that like Earth made?

2018
02:06:11,550 --> 02:06:15,450
He's made well, he gets like
goats. I give you, you want,

2019
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:18,360
you want to know the,
the source of your,

2020
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:21,090
of your like there you go.
What do you say?

2021
02:06:21,690 --> 02:06:24,160
Locally sourced local tech.

2022
02:06:26,440 --> 02:06:30,540
But nonetheless made in America.
That's true. Okay, so youtube,

2023
02:06:30,570 --> 02:06:34,260
you can also subscribe to the Youtube
Channel, which is the Jocko podcast,

2024
02:06:34,261 --> 02:06:38,080
youtube channel and are, since you're
putting all this new stuff on the store,

2025
02:06:38,081 --> 02:06:40,320
you're going to put some new
videos up at some point in the,

2026
02:06:40,380 --> 02:06:45,030
you know America History
American. Yeah, sure.

2027
02:06:45,520 --> 02:06:49,380
Yes I am. Thank you. Okay. I know
you were just telling me about one,

2028
02:06:50,100 --> 02:06:53,040
you've done this before where you tell
me about a video and I never see it for

2029
02:06:53,041 --> 02:06:57,330
four months because like, well, and
this one could be one of those cuts.

2030
02:06:57,350 --> 02:07:01,960
It's like I'm going to be like pushing
it. You know? Remember the war path one,

2031
02:07:02,770 --> 02:07:05,310
I pushed it in the music and I was like,
hey,

2032
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:09,330
should I make a bunch of things
crumbling down? Is that going to be dumb?

2033
02:07:12,180 --> 02:07:16,770
But in the process of doing that,
sometimes I'm like, this is kind of done,

2034
02:07:17,010 --> 02:07:21,750
so I got to change it. So
I'm going to see, I want to
push it out of fun, but yeah,

2035
02:07:21,780 --> 02:07:24,480
okay, I'm going to try it. How
about that? More, more videos.

2036
02:07:24,540 --> 02:07:27,180
And also we've got psychological warfare,
which we have failed.

2037
02:07:27,210 --> 02:07:30,090
We were going to get out that for the
new year. We did not accomplish that.

2038
02:07:30,091 --> 02:07:33,840
So that's not good.
But we will work on it.

2039
02:07:33,841 --> 02:07:36,250
And the current one is available.
Psychological warfare

2040
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:37,990
on iTunes, Google play, MP,

2041
02:07:37,991 --> 02:07:42,310
three platforms of all kinds
where you can get little messages.

2042
02:07:42,340 --> 02:07:47,340
We'll call from me tracks about how to
overcome a particular weakness that you

2043
02:07:47,711 --> 02:07:49,420
might be dealing with in the moment.

2044
02:07:50,110 --> 02:07:54,550
I thought about this with
psychological warfare. Sometimes,

2045
02:07:54,910 --> 02:07:59,110
like when the weakness creeps in,
we don't want to fight the weakness.

2046
02:07:59,410 --> 02:08:03,850
It's like, yeah, like we're like,
it's almost like, okay this is me.

2047
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:08,680
You might not be up to to relate cause
you get mad when you feel like weakness.

2048
02:08:09,100 --> 02:08:14,100
Sometimes weakness won't like creep in
and I'll look forward to not lifting,

2049
02:08:14,280 --> 02:08:17,890
you know what I mean? Or like, okay, so

2050
02:08:19,450 --> 02:08:21,430
there's this burger place.
All right.

2051
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:26,060
I'm not gonna say which one and
to go to this burger places,

2052
02:08:26,080 --> 02:08:30,930
certain burger you can get that's
like off the program. You can't. Oh,

2053
02:08:30,931 --> 02:08:35,620
okay. It's not a Diet
Burger. Yeah. So when I,

2054
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:38,230
you know, when you're like, oh,
should I just stick to the program,

2055
02:08:38,231 --> 02:08:42,280
but I'm really in the mood for this
burger. Right. And the weakness creeps in,

2056
02:08:43,150 --> 02:08:47,650
takes hold, and then you made
the decision, all right, hey,

2057
02:08:47,651 --> 02:08:51,250
I'm going to slip on the Diet right
now. I'm back on the plan. I'm black,

2058
02:08:51,251 --> 02:08:54,250
but I'm back on the program tomorrow,
but I'm going to slip right now.

2059
02:08:54,550 --> 02:08:57,880
When you make that decision in
your head, you feel good. Like, oh,

2060
02:08:57,881 --> 02:09:01,030
I don't want to change my mind because
I was so looking forward to the burger.

2061
02:09:01,250 --> 02:09:03,220
See what I'm saying?
So it's like,

2062
02:09:03,221 --> 02:09:07,390
what are those things where the reason
sometimes people won't list, or,

2063
02:09:08,380 --> 02:09:11,230
actually this has never happened to me,
but I'm imagining the P,

2064
02:09:11,320 --> 02:09:14,230
if someone doesn't want to listen to the
psychological warfare it, that's why.

2065
02:09:14,770 --> 02:09:18,310
Because it's like, oh, they just
secretly, they don't want to accept it.

2066
02:09:18,311 --> 02:09:22,720
And it's like, you know, and
the except the weakness. Yeah.

2067
02:09:23,050 --> 02:09:26,380
This again reminds me that I'm glad I'm
not trapped inside your head for more

2068
02:09:26,381 --> 02:09:29,440
than two hours.
Daily strong

2069
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:34,930
nonetheless, psychological or it's a good
one. It helps. It helps you gotta eat.

2070
02:09:35,150 --> 02:09:38,050
You gotta accept the hell
you have to do is press play.

2071
02:09:38,470 --> 02:09:40,060
That's the point you've got to go.
That's where what you were saying,

2072
02:09:40,440 --> 02:09:41,273
you have to press play.

2073
02:09:41,410 --> 02:09:45,340
You gotta there's a little psychological
part that you have to accept the fact

2074
02:09:45,341 --> 02:09:49,570
that you're going to, you're going
to get a spot. It's like in the gym,

2075
02:09:50,230 --> 02:09:54,460
right? When you need a spot in the
gym, you don't put on some lightweight,

2076
02:09:54,670 --> 02:09:58,180
you know you get a, if you have a regular
way on, you don't need a spot in cool,

2077
02:09:58,540 --> 02:10:02,140
but you got to make the decision to
put the heavy weight on there and then

2078
02:10:02,141 --> 02:10:04,630
you've got to make the decision
to go find someone to spot you.

2079
02:10:04,840 --> 02:10:07,840
That part is hard for people. That's
what I think. That's what I think.

2080
02:10:08,230 --> 02:10:10,000
But once you get the
spot and got the spot,

2081
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:13,840
you're in no danger of getting
buried underneath that, that match.

2082
02:10:14,040 --> 02:10:15,250
You see what I'm saying?
Check.

2083
02:10:15,280 --> 02:10:19,630
That's a psychological warfare
is can we get it on? Ah, what?

2084
02:10:19,631 --> 02:10:24,310
Amazon music and I tunes Apple Music.

02:12:51,260 --> 02:12:55,160
It's on Amazon music, iTunes,
Google play and other MP3 platforms.

2124
02:12:55,280 --> 02:12:56,900
Of course we have extreme ownership,

2125
02:12:58,340 --> 02:13:01,020
which was recently,
uh,

2126
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:04,790
made some kind of chart
for the audio book. Leif,

2127
02:13:04,791 --> 02:13:07,310
Leif Babin and I read the audio book.
Well,

2128
02:13:07,580 --> 02:13:12,580
me and the Texas is Batman reading the
Audio Book and we also read the audio

2129
02:13:12,741 --> 02:13:16,580
book for the followup to that book, which
is called the dichotomy of leadership,

2130
02:13:16,581 --> 02:13:20,240
which I kicked off today with
a tiny little excerpt. Um,

2131
02:13:21,020 --> 02:13:25,310
that's the fallen one
book. And I think, yeah,

2132
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:28,400
some people think it's better.
Interesting.

2133
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:32,040
It makes sense that it is because now
we've written more books and little

2134
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:36,330
more experienced. Learn more. So find
out for yourself dichotomy of leadership.

2135
02:13:36,331 --> 02:13:38,010
That one's available.
We also got Ashkelon Font.

2136
02:13:38,011 --> 02:13:41,610
That's our leadership consultancy.
We solve problems through leadership.

2137
02:13:41,611 --> 02:13:42,300
That's what we do.

2138
02:13:42,300 --> 02:13:47,300
If you need help with the leadership at
your organization and if you have any

2139
02:13:49,231 --> 02:13:52,290
kind of issue, whatever kind of issue
you have, it's a leadership problem.

2140
02:13:52,680 --> 02:13:56,190
It's not a problem of HR.
It's a leadership problem.

2141
02:13:56,191 --> 02:13:59,220
It's a not a problem in the
finance department. It's a,
it's a leadership problem.

2142
02:13:59,221 --> 02:14:01,290
It's not an operational problem.
It's a leadership problem.

2143
02:14:01,710 --> 02:14:04,080
The problem that you have in your
organization as a leadership problem,

2144
02:14:04,350 --> 02:14:08,700
if you need help with that,
go to echelon front front.com for details.

2145
02:14:09,300 --> 02:14:13,770
Also we got the muster. The muster is
now live. We got Chicago, we got Denver,

2146
02:14:13,771 --> 02:14:17,130
we've got Sydney. If you want to come
to the muster leadership conference,

2147
02:14:17,190 --> 02:14:22,050
extreme ownership.com all of the musters
have sold out and all the ministers

2148
02:14:22,110 --> 02:14:25,770
will sell out.
So if you want to come get there early,

2149
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:31,880
I think there's maybe a ticket or two
left for the live podcasts that we are

2150
02:14:33,481 --> 02:14:37,200
recording January 9th in New York City.

2151
02:14:37,470 --> 02:14:38,520
If you want to come to that,

2152
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:43,880
try and jump on and buy a ticket real
quick cause it's real close to sold out.

2153
02:14:45,150 --> 02:14:49,560
Look forward to seeing their also
f online. So we just launched this.

2154
02:14:50,040 --> 02:14:50,910
What this is,

2155
02:14:50,940 --> 02:14:55,940
this is an online interactive
leadership training source.

2156
02:14:57,120 --> 02:15:01,800
It's myself and the rest of the echelon
front training team puts together,

2157
02:15:02,300 --> 02:15:05,160
want to be able to reach more
people. Some of the, you know,

2158
02:15:05,161 --> 02:15:10,161
this kind of spawn from organizations
that we work with where they have tens of

2159
02:15:10,290 --> 02:15:13,140
thousands or even in some cases hundreds
of thousands of employees and they want

2160
02:15:13,141 --> 02:15:16,290
us to train everybody on the fundamental
principles of combat leadership.

2161
02:15:16,710 --> 02:15:21,090
Obviously with our six or seven
instructors, we can't do that.

2162
02:15:21,120 --> 02:15:26,100
And so we had to figure out a whale
way to scale the educational process.

2163
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:30,690
And so what we did is we went to virtual
and so we put this together and once we

2164
02:15:30,691 --> 02:15:32,400
made it we said, well
what's it? We've made it.

2165
02:15:32,430 --> 02:15:37,170
We're making it director to consumer as
well. So if you want to check that out,

2166
02:15:37,171 --> 02:15:42,171
