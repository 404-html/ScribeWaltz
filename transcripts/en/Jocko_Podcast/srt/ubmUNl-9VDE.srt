00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,090
Jocko,
Leif and Echo

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,750
your opinion has been solicited on
this leadership question right here.

3
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:11,100
So we'll see how that works out.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,500
A good leader ensures his team understands
what their goals are and why they are

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,790
performing tasks.

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:23,010
But how do you balance doing this with
not being the leader that talks so much

7
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:24,870
that the team stops listening?
We did.

8
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:27,690
We just cover this for a long period
of time. Pretty much it didn't we,

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,240
I guess we can leave it at this echo.

10
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:33,810
Do you agree with what we said earlier
or do you have a different opinion about

11
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:38,790
talking too much and mind you,
you've said a lot today, so don't be,

12
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,150
don't get crazy over here
or we'll stop listening.

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,930
The guy who talks too much, no, less
is more a hundred percent I agree.

14
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,730
There you go. I like it. I will say it.

15
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:58,360
Musters a win echos, echos
words to the audience. Um,

16
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,950
he always gives an epic speech,
have,

17
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,650
have solicited probably the greatest
applause of everyone out there. Yeah, man.

18
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:09,410
See I guess to dig in this little
bit of how to balance that with,

19
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,700
with being a leader that talks too much,

20
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,820
I think you've got to pay attention to
what the reactions are you getting from

21
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:15,640
people,
right?

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,360
You've got to pay attention to the
reactions you're getting from people.

23
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,680
If the people are not totally,
uh,

24
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,820
actively listening to you, right? If
they're not actively listening to you,

25
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,560
if they're taking notes,

26
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:30,660
if they're looking at their
phone or what not taking notes,

27
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:33,510
but if they're looking at their
phone or whatever, then you're,

28
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,910
you're talking too much.
Keep it short,

29
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,220
keep it concise and people will
listen to you more also that, um,

30
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,950
when you say you got to pay attention
to yourself, that's like a deep one.

31
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,080
It's like you just said it
really simply like, Oh hey,

32
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:50,180
just pay attention to yourself. I
mean, you didn't say it like that,

33
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:52,880
but that's what it felt like.
That's the hardest part right there.

34
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,470
Because a lot of times like,
hey,

35
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:58,250
me and life are talking and lay starts
looking at his phone. I'm not thinking,

36
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:01,040
Hey, I'm talking too much. I'm saying what
I'm saying, it's not interesting enough.

37
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:01,791
So I need,

38
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:05,990
so I need to say some more cool stuff or
I need to be more this or more of that

39
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:09,110
because I'm losing them kind of thing.
Like if I'm losing you,

40
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,700
the intuitive thought is not to
completely disconnect and stop talking and

41
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,620
that's not the intuitive thought. Seems
like when you're in a situation, Joe,

42
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,700
you got to pay attention to
that kind of stuff on yourself.

43
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,260
Jocko does this all the time.

44
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,950
Why do I do like the buses phone out and
start answering emails, whatever action.

45
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:28,370
You know what I got? Okay, cool.
I guess their conversations,

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,140
I do that to Dean and dean lister.
So Dean,

47
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,040
Dean deans, really important stuff we're
talking about here. He's like, yeah,

48
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,150
no what Dean does always see if it
makes him mad, right? He's got the,

49
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,210
he's got the pet peeve.
So Dean will be telling us something.

50
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,740
And so you're doing it on purpose
to get under her skin. Uh, no.

51
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:52,610
Sometimes he's saying some rambling
stuff. Right? And I've got stuff going on,

52
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:54,320
Dean, come on. I know you're
listening to this bro.

53
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,640
But sometimes he'll be saying something
to me and all of a sudden I'll like,

54
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,620
I'll like look around and,

55
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,180
and now I realize I'll just be watching
people do Jujitsu cause we're normally

56
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:05,170
on the mat.
Well this happens.

57
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,650
So he's telling me something like looking
me in the eyes and he's like, you know,

58
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:09,760
when the ancient blah blah blah blah,

59
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,700
he'll be telling me about
the Peloponnesian war or
something or whatever. And,

60
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,150
and as I'm listening to them,

61
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,900
I'll kind of look and I'll like start
looking at someone that's training or

62
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:22,540
looking at something and he'll,
he'll like attack me.

63
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:28,000
He went through a period where he would
just attack me and like take me down and

64
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:32,380
just start, you know, going psycho
on me. So that got me tuned up.

65
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,590
They've got me tuned up where I try
and give dean some more attention.

66
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,250
I like that. I think that's
a, I think that's a good,

67
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,280
do you feel like when he starts
doing that side of the bright,

68
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,550
I see what you're doing.
Well, the thing is though,

69
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:49,110
is that I think you're in the same boat
late for, I know you kind of know, know,

70
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,880
like in everyday life with
other people you might think,

71
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,130
I mean intuitively anyway, like,
Oh, I'm losing them or whatever.

72
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:57,680
But you can tell with him if he starts
doing that stuff and you're like, okay,

73
00:03:57,681 --> 00:04:02,130
and he's, or yeah, move on or something.
But it's only because, you know,

74
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,390
like, listen, if you can give me
35 more seconds, we'll be done.

75
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,000
You can move on and do
whatever you need to.

76
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,640
I will say that's a bad characteristic
that I have where I can do that.

77
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:14,620
Sometimes I'm done listening to you,

78
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:20,020
so wrap it up all the time in the system.
