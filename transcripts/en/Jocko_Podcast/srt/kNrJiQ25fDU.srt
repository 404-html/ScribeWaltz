00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,930
This is Jocko podcast number
one 10 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,540
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,000
All sciences have principles and rules.

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,640
War has none.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,020
The great captains who have
written of it give us none.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,650
Extreme cleverness is required to even
understand them and it is impossible to

7
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:33,321
base any judgment on their relations of
the historian historians for they only

8
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:37,080
speak of war as their
imaginations painted.

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,020
As for the great captains
who have written of it,

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,160
they've attempted rather to be
interesting than instructive.

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,910
Since the mechanics of
war is dry and tedious,

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,820
books dealing with it have small success
and their merit will not be recognized

13
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:55,740
except after the passage of time.

14
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,610
Those writing historically
of war have better luck.

15
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,720
They are sought by all the curious
and kept in the all libraries.

16
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:09,590
That is why we only have a confused
idea of the discipline of the Greeks and

17
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:14,811
Romans wore is a science covered
with shadows in who's obscurity.

18
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:21,651
One cannot move within assured
step routine and prejudice.

19
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,100
The natural result of ignorance
or its foundation and support.

20
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,560
Nothing is so disgraceful
as lavishness to custom.

21
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,290
This is both a result of
ignorance and a proof of it.

22
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,051
Chevalier,

23
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:47,640
full lard supposes all men to be brave
at all times and does not realize that

24
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:50,430
the courage of the troops
must be reborn daily,

25
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,220
that nothing is so variable.

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,080
And that the true skill of a general
consists of knowing how to guarantee it by

27
00:01:58,081 --> 00:02:00,390
his dispositions,
his positions,

28
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,960
and those traits of genius that
characterized great captains.

29
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,120
Perhaps he reserved of this immense disc,

30
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:14,270
perhaps he reserved discussion of this
immense subject and perhaps also escaped

31
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:19,230
him. Nevertheless, it is
of all the elements of war,

32
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,440
the one that is most necessary to study
the same troops who if attacking would

33
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:28,590
have been victorious,
may be inevitable,

34
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,980
invariably defeated in entrenchments.

35
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,580
Few men have accounted for
it in a reasonable manner
for it lies in human hearts

36
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,380
and one should search for it.

37
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:44,040
There no one has written of this matter,

38
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,850
which is of the most importance,
the most learned,

39
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,170
and the most profound of
the profession of war.

40
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,190
And without a knowledge
of the human heart,

41
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,730
one is dependent upon the favor of
which sometimes is very inconstant.

42
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,220
So those are some opening words from a
book called reveries on war by Marise de

43
00:03:13,681 --> 00:03:17,800
sacs.
This guy's a character Marista sacks.

44
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,870
You do a little research on them.

45
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,850
Did you find out how much of a character
he was? He was a serious character.

46
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,560
There's a couple of things.
There's a couple of things.

47
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:30,160
Even in that opening right there that I
wasn't sure if I was going to cover this

48
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:33,760
and I was kind of like going back to
it to see if it was something we should

49
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:37,390
cover. But I just, when
you get right here,

50
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:42,220
all sciences have principles and rules.
War has none. That's a true statement.

51
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,300
And it's true that there's, you
know, there's principles of warfare,

52
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,640
but there's no actual rules.
Like you can do whatever you want.

53
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,550
I mean you can say the Geneva Convention,
but then you can just defy it and just,

54
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,280
you know, you can do things that
are completely opposed to it.

55
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,700
So there's no rules.
You should do whatever you want to win.

56
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,670
Now you could lose your respect and you
could act in humane and that might cost

57
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:08,560
you in the long run. But if wars war,
there's no other thing like that.

58
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,880
Right. There's no other thing
like that. Do whatever you want.

59
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,230
I guess if you had a,

60
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,660
if you had like a street fight with no
weapons and someone going to do whatever

61
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:24,290
they could to win. Right.
That's the thing. It's, that's
war. It's the same thing.

62
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,480
Yeah. I'm sure. Yeah.

63
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:30,100
When you deal with like death is kind
of the goal and the consequences at the

64
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:32,440
same time, like death. That's
the end of the line. So yeah.

65
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:36,970
Anything goes essentially.
Yeah. Yeah. Nothing else is
like that. Then he says this,

66
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,830
nothing is so disgraceful as slavish
to custom. That's a bold statement to,

67
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,240
I agree. Disgraceful. He calls it,

68
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,840
he talks about these prejudices that
people have, I think you call them,

69
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,620
what do you call them, by biases,
right? Cognitive biases. He talks about,

70
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,310
he doesn't talk about that, but he talks
about them, but this guy was a character.

71
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:02,790
He lived from 1696 to 1750 he started off
as a German soldier in the army of the

72
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:07,930
holy Roman Empire,

73
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:11,920
which was like this bunch of territories
in Europe that were banded together

74
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:14,560
under that name.
And they were around for a long time,

75
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,770
from like the Middle Ages until
the time of the Napoleonic wars.

76
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,440
So the early 18 hundreds and he served
also served in the imperial army,

77
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,470
which was another kind of army that often
fought alongside the army of the whole

78
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,050
holy Roman Empire.
And if buddy,

79
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:39,060
but the weird thing is is he finished
his career as the Marshall General of

80
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:43,180
France.
And so he had kind of,

81
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,050
I guess you could say
kind of switched sides,

82
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:50,051
but he Rose Rose up through the ranks
because his military career started at the

83
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:51,490
age of 13

84
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,310
when he fought at the battle of Mal per k.

85
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,670
I think that's how you say it,
which, and that, that, that war,

86
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,960
that battle right there was,

87
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:06,280
that was between the army of the
holy Roman Empire and France.

88
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,650
So he was on both sides at
certain points of his life.

89
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,310
And I think the whole time he was,
it seems like from what I read about him,

90
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:18,170
he was always kind of looking
to go up the social structure,

91
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,631
you know,

92
00:06:18,631 --> 00:06:23,030
rate rise up in the social structure
and become more powerful person in the

93
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:26,630
hierarchy of those times
in the dominance hierarchy.

94
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,650
So yeah, he started fighting
at age 13 which by the way,

95
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,720
that's just so cool. I don't, I'm
sorry if you think I'm a bad person,

96
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,370
but as far as I'm concerned,

97
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,990
if I could have joined the military at 13
I would have been so stoked. Uh, sorry,

98
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:46,070
everyone that's, that doesn't agree
with that. That's just how I roll.

99
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,670
I'm just telling the truth on that one.
And actually as I look back on my life,

100
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:51,110
if I could've done that
would've been even better.

101
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,350
I think they should allow
people to join the military.

102
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:56,840
They should have some like a Youth Corp.
Yeah,

103
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,200
you can go in and just get
after it at a young age,

104
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,570
but they think they think a 13 year old
can't make that decision and the right,

105
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,280
the 13 year old can't make that decision.

106
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:10,790
So you'd have to have really benevolent
people that were in charge of them in

107
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:11,720
charge of these troops.

108
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,710
And you also think that an 18 year
old person can make a good decision.

109
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,680
But if that's not true either,

110
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,940
cause you've got 18 people that are
dumber than dirt and make bad decisions

111
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,470
and people are worried that you're going
to get thoughts put into your head.

112
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:29,360
Yeah, you are. You are. I guess
what if they're good thoughts,

113
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:33,350
right on. That's not a
bad thing, right? Yeah.

114
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,980
I mean do you have to learn everything
yourself? Is that the way the world works?

115
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,930
You can't have good
ideas put into your head.

116
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,340
You can't get a little bit programmed.

117
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,770
You could get programmed
to be a better human being.

118
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:45,100
Would you accept that programming?
Yeah, of course. But Hey,

119
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,500
I'm just checking you're over there
looking like I'm a bad person because I'm

120
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,800
trying to brainwash, you know, cause
you're just saying the word better.

121
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,260
Good and better. Like there's this
universal good and better. You know,

122
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:59,120
there is no, there isn't. I mean there is,
okay, we have Jordan B. Peterson on here.

123
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:00,230
You can converse that where you could,

124
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:03,170
you could have a conversation with
him about that. How do you say that?

125
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:06,080
You don't know that there's universal
good and use universal banks? No, no, no.

126
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:06,771
I'm saying,
I mean,

127
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:09,370
we could give dozens of things
right now that we know are good.

128
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:13,480
I don't know if the child,
is that good or bad for you,

129
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,550
see where I'm going to take something
that doesn't belong to you, good or bad.

130
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,240
But those, there's still basic
and fundamental that you don't,

131
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,260
you don't need a youth corp to,
well,

132
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:23,480
there's a lot of people out there
that don't get taught that stuff.

133
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,640
And that's true too. But that's
a whole different issue. Okay.

134
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,460
Well I'm just making sure. Yeah.
But if you're, yeah, I know. Well,

135
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:31,790
you're saying how you're saying
like good ideas and good ideas.

136
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:36,380
You're talking about your
way specifically, which I
think, no, no, no, I was not.

137
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:38,070
I would not. And I still even, you know,

138
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,240
I get in trouble for this because
for instance, if people say, oh,

139
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:44,480
you shouldn't wake up at four 30 in the
morning. And, and I always say like, yeah,

140
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:47,290
I know. I'm not saying you have to
wake up at four 30 in the morning.

141
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,940
I'm saying to wake up earlier.
Don't be lazy. Yeah. Right.

142
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:54,950
I'm not saying you have to, I say, you
know, don't eat donuts. Right? Sure.

143
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,190
I'm not saying you can never

144
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,220
taste anything that tastes good. I'm
just saying it'd be smart, man. Come on.

145
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,040
You don't need a donut and
donuts are actually on the eval.

146
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,630
They might just be pure evil too,
by the way. Right. Come on, man.

147
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,990
Don't assume Sony, they don't even
make you feel, I mean, is there any,

148
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:12,500
do you get any satisfaction
from a donut status? Well,

149
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,510
it depends on what you mean
by satisfaction and you
always want to try and parse

150
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:19,680
these things. Well, you can't tell
him absolutely. Okay. Of 10 seconds.

151
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:24,600
Good taste in your mouth. Sugar Rush,
get SOM and technically pay for that.

152
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:30,210
Health and fitness. You don't
seem to care. No. W who me?
Oh yeah. Nah Man, I care.

153
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,250
I care a lot. Okay. I'm just
making sure I'm trying to,

154
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:36,740
I'm trying to look at it from all angles,
satisfaction technically and by lucky.

155
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,570
But you could come up with
some fundamental good things
and I'll tell you this,

156
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:41,760
the military does teach some
fundamental good things.

157
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,610
So if I could have joined at the age
of 13 it would have been good for me.

158
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:45,660
I would have been stoked.
Actually.

159
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,220
I would have missed out
on some cool stuff too.

160
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:51,000
Cause I had some fun back in the jury
and I did the stuff that actually led to

161
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:55,800
me being who I am today. You
know, I learned some stuff
but not what I'm saying.

162
00:09:55,801 --> 00:10:00,510
The point is, is that your
way, not everyone will agree.

163
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,290
I agree with you. Okay. And
I'm sure a bunch of people do,

164
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,520
but I'm just saying
there's like different, no,

165
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:10,390
I guess I'm not pro universal
brainwashing to mind methods of I'm not,

166
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,470
I'm not, which makes 13 year old by
the way, which a 13 year old now.

167
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,260
I'll tell you, I just said that,
that going in the military,

168
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:18,360
I would have missed out on some things,
you know,

169
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:22,110
maybe some growing up experiences.
Uh, Marista sac didn't miss out on a,

170
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,530
on a damn thing cause he was getting
after it in many different ways,

171
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,600
not only on the battlefield but also as a,
a little bit of a maniac.

172
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,970
He was, he, first of all, he was
like apparently a physically,

173
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:38,570
he was kind of a beast of a man
and like physically and he fought,

174
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:40,440
he,
he kind of proved himself.

175
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:44,640
He distinguished themselves in some
big battles as he was 13, 14, 15, 16,

176
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:45,570
17 years old.

177
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,160
Apparently he could bend a horse
shoe with his hand. And, and I,

178
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,680
I was looking at that, I was thinking
myself. He, they mean hands, right?

179
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,750
They must be enhanced.

180
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,410
It didn't say that it's at
hand and I didn't want to
take anything away from him.

181
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,620
So apparently he could grab,
uh,

182
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,170
he was big and can grab a horseshoe
and just bend it in one hand.

183
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:12,650
So he had some some serious strength
and through his life he commanded

184
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:16,620
companies,
which he actually refers to as centuries,

185
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,500
which if you can imagine century,

186
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:24,501
we know that means a hundred so a
century like the ancient Roman army had

187
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,530
centuries instead of companies and
they weren't even a hundred people.

188
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:32,070
There were like 80 people,
but he led those,

189
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,990
he led regiments and he led whole armies
and he fought with a lot of success

190
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:41,070
throughout his career. Now
with that, that being said,

191
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:47,030
he was far from what anyone would
actually consider a role model because he,

192
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,650
the way he lived his personal life was not
exactly exempt rurally. Exempt, Burley.

193
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,980
I didn't say that word right.

194
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,610
Exam. Blurry. Yes, simpler down. In fact,

195
00:11:57,611 --> 00:12:01,900
all the way he lived his life was
probably the opposite of role model.

196
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:07,110
So he was forced into marriage at the
age of 18 he didn't want to get married

197
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,440
because he's, I think he was too
much of a womanizer and said,

198
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:12,274
I don't want to get married,

199
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:17,310
but he married this heiress 14
year old Eris with a ton of money.

200
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,870
He blew all her money and he was
18 she was 18 she was 14 she was,

201
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:23,170
she was an error with a bunch of money.

202
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:27,730
He took all our money and blew it on
horses for his regiment and on women,

203
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,793
Mr Cysts.

204
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,820
And then he had a bunch of public affairs
and everyone kind of knew about it.

205
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:37,720
And the marriage got an old and he
continued this kind of want and behavior,

206
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,100
I think throughout his life.

207
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,890
And a couple times he's hypocritical
because in the book he talks about certain

208
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:43,360
types of people.
And I don't know if I cover it,

209
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:47,780
but he does come across a
little bit hypocritical Buffalo,

210
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,390
hypocritical sometimes.

211
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,840
Now I think one of this is this one
quote I grabbed from this mistress,

212
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:59,260
this kind of famous mistress actually,

213
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:04,420
she's recognized as the chief mistress
of King Louis the 15th so did you know

214
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:06,700
that the king had like not
just mistresses, we know that,

215
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:08,290
but there's a chief mistress whose known,

216
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:14,980
her name was Madame de Pompadour and
this is what she said about Saks.

217
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,480
Marista Sachs does not understand
anything about the delicacy of love.

218
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,910
The only pleasure he takes in the society
of women can be summed up in one word,

219
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,080
debauchery.

220
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,300
Okay,

221
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,790
so he's a little bit out of control.

222
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:34,390
He might have in fact inherited his,

223
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,020
yeah.

224
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:40,340
Lifestyle choices or from his dad
whose name was Frederick Augustus,

225
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,060
who was well known for his personal,

226
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,710
unbridled lust.
Sure.

227
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,200
How do you know that he had on
bridal lust? Well, case in point,

228
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,750
Maurice was the eldest
son reached to Sachs,

229
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:58,751
was the eldest of 354 acknowledged
illegitimate children that Frederick

230
00:14:01,371 --> 00:14:02,204
fathered.

231
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:08,170
So while we might not want to emulate
Marista sacks his personal life,

232
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:16,270
he was an experienced and successful
leader of men on the battlefield.

233
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,130
And we can learn from him.
And with that,

234
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,740
let's go back to the book
and here's Marista Sachs,

235
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:32,120
a man who has a talent for
architecture and Ken design.

236
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,900
We'll draw the plan and perspective
of a palace with great skill,

237
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,330
but if he is to execute it,

238
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,810
if he does not know how to shape
his stones to lay his foundation,

239
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,300
the whole edifice will crash soon.

240
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:48,830
It's the same with the general who does
not know the principles of his art,

241
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:54,100
nor how to organize his troops for these
are indispensable qualifications in all

242
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,940
the operations of war.

243
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:02,210
The prodigious success with which the
Romans always gained with small armies

244
00:15:04,941 --> 00:15:09,200
against multitudes of barbarians can be
attributed to nothing but the excellent

245
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:10,910
composition of their troops.

246
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,980
Not that I would infer from this that
a man of genius will not be able to

247
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:20,480
succeed even at the head of an
army of tartars. It is much,

248
00:15:20,481 --> 00:15:22,670
this is the,
this is the interesting part.

249
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:27,671
It is much easier to take men as they
are then to make them as they should be.

250
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,950
It is difficult to reconcile
opinions, prejudice, prejudices,

251
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,700
and passions.
So there's a couple of interesting things.

252
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:41,450
I also forgot to point
out that he wrote this

253
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,880
kind of on a whim and he actually starts
off this, this whole book kind of,

254
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,200
he says this work was not born from a
desire to establish a new method of the

255
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:54,560
art award. It was composed
to amuse and instruct myself.

256
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,040
And then one of the last things he
says in the book is to the readers,

257
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,590
I wrote this book in 13 nights.
I was sick.

258
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,920
Thus it very probably
shows the fever I had.

259
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,320
This should supply my excuses for the
irregularity of the arrangement as well as

260
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:17,321
the inelegance of the style I wrote
militarily to anticipate my boredom.

261
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:22,580
Now on top of those,
that excuse right on top of that,

262
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,650
he was a big opium user.

263
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,590
So we're figuring he was probably right
in this and an impaired state. Sure.

264
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,990
We're dealing with it. We're not, we're
not mad about it, but we're realistic.

265
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:36,680
And the reason I say this is because some
of the writing is a little bit tricky

266
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,950
and some run on sentences and yeah,

267
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,260
so we have to,

268
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,170
we have to pull a little bit
harder to get some nuggets,

269
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,100
but there's plenty of nuggets and I think
that's one of them is much easier to

270
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:51,110
take men as they are then to
make them as they should be.

271
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,580
And where I look at that as a leader,

272
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,410
you get people that are good at something
and you get someone that's not good at

273
00:16:57,411 --> 00:16:58,950
something,
but they're going to something else.

274
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,110
You put people where you can use them.

275
00:17:00,111 --> 00:17:05,111
You put people where their skills are
most available and where they can,

276
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,860
where they can

277
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,870
perform their duties to the highest level
because they're naturally good at it.

278
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,790
That's all it's saying. I'm not having
you proof read my writing at night, right?

279
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,690
Yeah. No, no, no, I'm not,

280
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:26,060
and I'm not over here trying to
make videos. No, I'm not. Right.

281
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:31,220
You see where I'm going with us. So it
would it, it'd be easier if you said,

282
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:33,050
you know what, Jocko, when
it comes to the podcast,

283
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:36,830
why don't you come up with a talking
a bunch of talking and I'll make cool

284
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:40,880
videos. Right. We kinda
did that. Otherwise we,

285
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,980
people would be listening to you talking
about movies from 1988 and comparing

286
00:17:46,491 --> 00:17:50,790
them to stuff very, very clunky, which
is, you know, it's fine. Yeah, but,

287
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:55,740
and then wouldn't you have to expend more
resources and your part to to coach me

288
00:17:55,741 --> 00:18:00,300
up. Yes. So imagine that and, and I'd
be trying to make videos, which I can,

289
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,260
and I'd have to coach you make
me mad. We don't want that. No,

290
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:07,260
it would make me mad because it's
dealing with computers and stuff.

291
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,740
I don't mind computers, but I
don't like them. Sure. No. So yeah.

292
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,800
Yeah. But that's a, that's a big part of
like why he's saying it though, right?

293
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:17,461
Because it's like,

294
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:19,890
it's like you're going to save yourself
a lot of time and headache. Exactly.

295
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,860
But when you're trying to coach
these guys up and when you,

296
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:26,790
when you get to the seal teams, it's like,
oh, you're a small, a small guy. Cool.

297
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,280
You're going to be appointment.
Yeah. Yeah. You're a big guy. Cool.

298
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,970
You're going to carry it at a and
m 60 or now to mark 48 that's what,

299
00:18:32,971 --> 00:18:33,804
that's how it's happening.

300
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,790
We're not going to take the small guy
and try and get him up him taller and

301
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:43,420
bigger and stronger and we're not going
to take the big guy and starving and

302
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,400
send them into ranger school. So he loses
38 pounds and he comes back and like,

303
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:51,630
okay, your appointment now. No,
let's, let's use nature. And he's,

304
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:54,450
he talks about that in other places.
All right,

305
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,870
he's talking about in
this section how to uh,

306
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,960
how to raise an army basically.
How do you make an army?

307
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:07,290
And I thought this one was a little bit
interesting because people ask me this

308
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,190
question all the time.

309
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,880
He's talking about mandatory service
and this is his opinion on it.

310
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,480
Would it not be better to
prescribe by law that every man,

311
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:19,080
whatever his condition in life should
be obliged to serve his prints in his

312
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:21,990
country for five years? It
doesn't, that's no joke.

313
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,920
Sometimes people say two years and that
seems reasonable and a lot of countries

314
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:28,650
do that. He says five years,
and it's kind of funny,

315
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:30,330
his attitude towards five
years back to the book,

316
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,350
this law could not be objected to
because it is natural and just that all

317
00:19:34,351 --> 00:19:38,310
citizens should occupy themselves with
the defense of the nation. Concur.

318
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,020
No inconvenience could result if they
were chosen between the ages of 20 and 30

319
00:19:43,021 --> 00:19:47,610
years.
These are all the years of Libertine Ej.

320
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,150
When youth seeks its fortune,
travels the country,

321
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,490
and is of little comfort to parents.

322
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:59,510
This would not be a public calamity
because one could be sure that when five

323
00:19:59,521 --> 00:20:02,790
years had passed, discharge would
be granted. So he's saying like,

324
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,310
people couldn't be mad about it cause it's
only five years. And he's also saying,

325
00:20:05,311 --> 00:20:07,050
look, this is when your kids
are out of control anyways.

326
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:09,780
You might as well have them
in the military. There's that,

327
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,730
that whole idea of the libertine that
took place back in the day and these guys

328
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:16,230
were, you know, basically wild

329
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:22,080
morally getting after it or I should.
They were, they were. They were.

330
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:26,130
They were partying, wicked heart. I'm
trying to think of a good way to say it.

331
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,940
They were pardoned. Wicked hard
with drugs, booze and women. Yeah,

332
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:34,350
the libertines and they,
that was,

333
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,180
they called them a rake.
Like if a guy,

334
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,720
a guy that was out there with a bunch
of different women all the time,

335
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,050
it'd be called the rakers, a bunch
of period novels that I had to read,

336
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,720
read when I was in college.
That's why I know about it,

337
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,640
about these libertine rakes.

338
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,370
So he continues on.

339
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,360
This method of raising troops would
provide an inexhaustible reservoir of fine

340
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:59,500
recruits who would not be subject
to desertion in course of time.

341
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:03,550
As a consequence, it would be regarded as
an honor to have fulfilled one service.

342
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,380
I'd say that's probably accurate,
but to produce this effect is essential.

343
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:12,580
To make no distinctions, to be immovable
on this point and to enforce the law,

344
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:17,410
particularly on the nobles and the rich,
then no one will complain,

345
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,560
hey, you gotta if you're
gonna do it to one person,

346
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:23,020
you got to do it to everyone equally.
Consequently,

347
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:28,170
those who had not served their time will
scorn those who are reluctant to obey

348
00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:30,370
the law and insensibly.

349
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:35,490
It will become an honor to serve the poor
bourgeois who will be consoled by the

350
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:41,320
example of the rich and the wrench will
not dare complain upon seeing the noble

351
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:44,140
serve arms is an honorable profession.

352
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,600
How many princes have borne arms?

353
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:50,350
Now what's interesting about this idea
is that there's some people in the world

354
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:54,340
that aren't really meant for warfare.
And so should we let nature,

355
00:21:54,341 --> 00:21:57,190
I I more, I'm more heavily
agree with the previous point.

356
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,370
You should let people do what
they're good at naturally.

357
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,010
So you're going to end up recruiting
people that might not be good at this

358
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:07,180
naturally. And that's not a good thing.
But not everyone was aware, right? No,

359
00:22:07,181 --> 00:22:09,500
you're right. You can put them
into different jobs. Yeah, that's,

360
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,080
that's absolutely true. They could
put the, the guy that's more, uh,

361
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:19,000
more apt to be like good at writing.

362
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:22,030
He could become a military journalist or
something like that. Yeah, you're right.

363
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:25,900
You know, people always ask me that
question. And the bottom line is,

364
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,330
it's a tough one.
I'm sure I don't have like a,

365
00:22:28,331 --> 00:22:31,360
some hardcore stance on it one
way or the other. We'll do.

366
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:35,650
I think it would benefit
everyone every 18 year old,

367
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:38,110
if they join the military,
it would benefit them.

368
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:41,290
I'm telling you it would benefit them.
Do I think it should be mandatory?

369
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:44,740
I don't really think so because I don't
want to have a bunch of draftees in the

370
00:22:44,741 --> 00:22:47,770
military and if you don't want to join
and you want to miss out on having that

371
00:22:47,771 --> 00:22:50,590
part in your life, that's your call
and that's fine. This is America.

372
00:22:50,591 --> 00:22:52,270
You can do what you want.
Yeah, that makes sense.

373
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,160
Cause on one on one hand you kind of
can look at it as like taxes, right?

374
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,970
Where, how it led. Just like
Kyle was saying. Um, you know,

375
00:23:00,971 --> 00:23:03,920
you have to have the
paraphrasing, the, the,

376
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:08,360
the pleasure of the honor to serve in
once your country's defendant. You know,

377
00:23:08,361 --> 00:23:10,450
like that,
that should be obvious.

378
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,680
And so it's Kinda like couldn't
compare it with paying taxes. Right?

379
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:18,160
Taxes go to public service for all this
stuff. And we live in this country.

380
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,220
We have public service, we all have
to pay for it, not just one person.

381
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:23,790
When we all pay tax, a lot of people
pay a lot more than other people. Yeah,

382
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:28,170
exactly right. And not more. Yeah, and
some people don't really pay taxes.

383
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,210
You just said everyone pays their taxes
and not everyone pays. I know that.

384
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,680
And if so, what if it was all
good? Yeah, perfect. Exactly.

385
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:40,350
Part of my point is, so let's say
I'm like, Hey, you just paid you to,

386
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,350
let's say it's tax time,
April 15th whatever. Some
people pay taxes year round,

387
00:23:44,351 --> 00:23:46,040
just FYI. Yeah, no, I'm just saying.

388
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,580
But at the time were called the quarterly
[inaudible]. You don't want none.

389
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:54,840
I actually know about that now. Thankfully
weren't nuts to think thing. Oh,

390
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:55,491
but you know,

391
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:59,240
let's just say for this example it 15
that's when everyone knows it's all right.

392
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,270
And you're like, yeah, I just
paid my taxes, you know, whatever.

393
00:24:02,271 --> 00:24:04,910
Like I didn't like giving my money
away, but that's it. You know,

394
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:08,160
just like people in the draft situation
or military, military, military,

395
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,570
I didn't want to, I would rather
go be a a rake or whatever and,

396
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:16,440
but I'm doing it and boom, I did it.
And then you got me, or maybe not me,

397
00:24:16,441 --> 00:24:20,150
someone else saying, Oh yeah, I didn't
pay my taxes. And then you're like, whoa,

398
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:23,290
wait, wait. You're saying it becomes
an honor to pay your taxes? You know?

399
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,430
Wish I could agree with
you. No, no, no. There's,

400
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,100
I think there's a part of your brain,
no matter how much you paid for Texas,

401
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,580
it is like you do have that
feeling like, yeah, I did my part.

402
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,040
Even though it sucked, even though
it hurt, even though, you know,

403
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,660
I would way rather have spent it on a
Disney vacation or something like that,

404
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:40,730
like I'm a citizen from
something that was productive,

405
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,040
generate more business or
something like that, you know?

406
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:46,700
Just little things like that,
but whatever. You see what
I'm saying? No. All right.

407
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,680
I mean, I hear you. It's
kind of the same thing.

408
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:53,060
That's one way to look at it though, where
you can, but the other one way. Yeah.

409
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,760
Yeah.
But the other way is just like you said,

410
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,690
if you get some people who were in there
in the military was certain like jobs

411
00:24:59,691 --> 00:25:02,150
or whatever, and they don't want
to be there. It's Kinda like,

412
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:06,860
it's Kinda too important to have people
like that. But you could have, yeah,

413
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,820
what you said is actually correct
that you could have, you know,

414
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:15,130
elements that just did other things in
the military that d would be more aligned

415
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:19,130
with a person's natural desires
of what they want to do. Yeah.

416
00:25:19,131 --> 00:25:21,590
And now there's something in the
navy called needs of the navy. Right.

417
00:25:21,591 --> 00:25:25,100
So you would get the navy, you, oh,

418
00:25:25,101 --> 00:25:28,460
I want to go get stationed
in Hawaii. Like, okay, what
are the needs of the navy?

419
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,670
Because the needs of the navy come first,
not you, not your family. Nothing. Yeah.

420
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,660
And, and so the needs and they would
come first. Well, yeah. And of course,

421
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:38,690
same thing with like a tax
situation where it's like you're,

422
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:42,470
if you don't want to do it,
it's kind of hard to be like,

423
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,850
I know you don't want to do it, but hey,
now that you're here, do what you want.

424
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,250
You know, you Kinda can't say
that. Otherwise I'll be like,

425
00:25:49,251 --> 00:25:51,440
I don't want to be here so I
can choose what I can do. Okay.

426
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:55,850
I'm going to do the the most smallest,
most late, least time consuming.

427
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,850
Like basically I'm gonna do this the
least I possibly can because I don't want

428
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:00,950
to be here to be in the military.
This is the vault,

429
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:04,490
this is the mandatory military.
This'll go and that'll go for it.

430
00:26:04,491 --> 00:26:05,324
So you're going to get,

431
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:09,200
it's kind of like get people that
would be not doing very much. Yeah,

432
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:14,030
it's essentially like a draft dodger
kind of situation. But within,

433
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,220
you know,
who didn't actually dage it if it,

434
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,800
I'm just saying if it were a scenario,

435
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:23,150
like we'll just put them where their
interests lie even though they have to be

436
00:26:23,151 --> 00:26:24,170
here. Yeah. See what I'm saying.

437
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,770
So I'm just saying that's the other
side of the coin where it's like, yeah,

438
00:26:26,771 --> 00:26:30,840
it's hard to make, make it work
in an absolute kind of way. Check.

439
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:36,230
All right. He talked a little bit about
clothing troops, what they should wear,

440
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,300
and this is just,
I thought this was interesting.

441
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:41,570
Our uniform is not only expensive
but very, very uncomfortable.

442
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,990
The soldiers neither shod nor clothed

443
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:48,990
nor covered the love of appearance
prevails over attention to health.

444
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,560
And this is one of the most important
points demanding our attention.

445
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:58,280
Hair is a dirty ornament for a soldier
in once the rainy season has arrived,

446
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,480
has had,
is never dry.

447
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,140
So it sounds to me like he's basically
saying he doesn't care how he looks,

448
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,800
he's healing to win.
They get,

449
00:27:06,801 --> 00:27:11,520
so hair is a dirty ornament
for a soldier in place of hats.

450
00:27:11,521 --> 00:27:14,650
I should prefer helmets. As for
shoes, this was interesting. You know,

451
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,720
people were minimalistic shoes with out.

452
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:23,130
We'd zero heel to toe drop
if you heard that expression.

453
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:28,200
No meaning it's the same level across.
So it's any of the barefoot type shoes.

454
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,770
They all say,
Oh zero heel to toe drop.

455
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:36,630
Meaning there's not an eight millimeter
difference between the height of the

456
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:41,220
heel and then it goes down to the
height of the toe. This is what he says.

457
00:27:41,221 --> 00:27:42,180
As for shoes,

458
00:27:42,181 --> 00:27:47,181
I would prefer the soldiers to have shoes
of thin level leather with low heels

459
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,060
instead of heavy boots.
They would be perfectly shod,

460
00:27:51,061 --> 00:27:52,940
would and would march with better grace.

461
00:27:52,941 --> 00:27:56,910
Since low heels would force
them to turn out their toes,

462
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,350
stretch their joints,

463
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,490
and consequently consequently
draw in their shoulders.

464
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,000
It's pretty interesting because everyone's
all in the rage of minimalistic shoes,

465
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:10,050
which I actually wear shoes that
don't have any heel toe drop.

466
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:15,720
Maybe I'm caught up in that fad,
but it's cool. But you know what?

467
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,070
When we were kids, right?
Chuck Taylors? Yeah. Yeah.

468
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:22,380
They have no heel toe drop people
so wearing cause they're good to go.

469
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,790
That's kind of all right. Well we'll
fill only way I know. Well there you go.

470
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,980
You're the big time trend.
You're, you're a early adopter.

471
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,870
Yeah. Again, I didn't know about,

472
00:28:34,871 --> 00:28:37,740
I probably chuck Taylor's a too
narrow for me to narrow. Yeah,

473
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,390
and they don't sell wide
ones. I've looked all right.

474
00:28:42,391 --> 00:28:44,340
Pay What you got to pay
people back to the book.

475
00:28:44,341 --> 00:28:46,980
Without going into detail about
the different rates of pay,

476
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,470
I shall only say that it should be ample.

477
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:54,810
It is better to have a small number of
well kept and well disciplined troops

478
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:59,190
than to have a great number who
are neglected in these matters.

479
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:04,530
It is not the big armies that win battles.
It is the good ones.

480
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,490
Economy can boost p pushed
only to a certain point.

481
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:14,540
It has limits beyond which
it degenerate into parsimony.

482
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,900
I had to look that word up by
the way. Parsa Motors. Yeah.

483
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,170
Occasionally you get one of those.
It means just super cheap.

484
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,180
Super cheap.

485
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,510
That's interesting because that doesn't
sound like that Dabney would fall in

486
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:28,960
that category.
Parthenon.

487
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,790
If your dad would be considered
parsimonious, I guess so. I know that my,

488
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:41,180
my dad liked many dads will
drive an extra 18 miles to save

489
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:46,600
3 cents a gallon on gas. Is that,
is it all bad to do that? No,

490
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:51,730
I don't know why they don't do that.
Well, yeah, you drive 18 miles. You're,

491
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,300
you're in the ocean most of the time.
But yeah,

492
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,420
I've heard of that before.
Isn't that like a false thing though?

493
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:02,940
Like cause he just kept driving drunk for
sure. It's kind of pointless. You know,

494
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,640
you get the APP that has the
cheapest gas prices in your area.

495
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,510
How much time are you spending looking
at an APP that you paid $3 for to find

496
00:30:10,511 --> 00:30:14,830
out whether you can save 2 cents a gallon
on gas. Now I get it, man. I'm cheap.

497
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:18,190
I inherited that. Right. I
don't like to spend money.

498
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,070
It's hard for me to part with
the, with the money, right.

499
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:25,330
Including the tax man by the
way. It's offered. So I get it.

500
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,310
But I also have to have some,

501
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,110
like sometimes my dad could be
irrational about irrational.

502
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:37,420
Just straight up crazy. Hey Wall,
you could save 2 cents. Yeah. Hey,

503
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:42,010
if you know I, he gets fired up about
that too. That's another thing, you know,

504
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:45,340
he always asks me how much the,
how much the gas out there in California.

505
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,620
I'm like, I didn't know
my pay for it. Anyways,

506
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,140
we'll stick the nozzle in there and
pull the trigger and rock and roll.

507
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,890
I got stuff I gotta do.
I'm not driving.

508
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:56,680
How much cheaper is gas on base when I
didn't know how much cheaper gas was on

509
00:30:56,681 --> 00:31:01,390
base, he was beside himself and then
we found out it was 8 cents a gallon.

510
00:31:01,391 --> 00:31:05,230
Cheaper all and keep you on.
Basically you want to go drive over there,

511
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:08,200
wait in line, show you right knee and
then we get on base. You got to wait.

512
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:12,910
Cause know. Yeah, come on. Wait,
isn't there because parsimonious.

513
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:17,080
Parsimonious. Yeah. Huh. I'm gonna try
it. Use Ellen. But that's because the,

514
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,230
because it's like a, it's
like a win, right? You get
a win when you got the deal.

515
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,800
You think you've got the psychological
when, yeah, yeah. No, that's,

516
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:28,110
that's definitely, that could
be it. A little victory.
Yeah. I think because yeah,

517
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,570
people like that too.
Back to the book.

518
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,600
Hope encourages men to endure and attempt
everything in depriving them of it or

519
00:31:39,581 --> 00:31:41,710
in making it to distance.

520
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:46,000
You deprive them of their very soul.
Now,

521
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,990
that immediately made me think of Stalin
Grad when we were reading about stolen

522
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:53,290
rod and the fact that the soldiers,

523
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,780
when something would give
him a glimmer of hope,

524
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,370
it would totally change their attitude
when they thought that the German troops

525
00:32:00,371 --> 00:32:04,440
were coming to rescue the guys that were
installing Grad in the pocket and solid

526
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:08,770
rock, they are all excited and they
were happy and he literally said like,

527
00:32:08,771 --> 00:32:10,880
everyone's morale went up and then
they find out they're not coming in.

528
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:14,200
Just crushed, crushed to morale. Yeah.

529
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,880
We think that's based on hope fully.

530
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:21,280
And that you kind of see that in like
in like like a workout for example.

531
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:24,010
Like if you have a, in football we,
we'd have like conditioning, right?

532
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,790
And sometimes they'd just be like, hey,
we're just running sprints, wind sprints.

533
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:30,280
They wouldn't say, Hey, we've got 10
wins for instance, is not like that.

534
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:35,080
And after a while, like guys are dying
and you know, not dying, but you know,

535
00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:38,560
we're getting tired. So the sprints
are a lot slower towards it,

536
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,220
but they say two more

537
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,160
finish hard for all of a sudden
everybody can run fast again.

538
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,380
You know what I'm saying?
Even though,

539
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,180
cause you see that little light thing
and tone at seconds. Pretty cool.

540
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:50,390
I was kidding.
But I do it.

541
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:55,510
And then you watch the hope.
Just go back to being slow

542
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:01,580
back to the book. This is,
this is pretty heavy. Truly.

543
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:06,610
The only good officers are the poor
gentleman who have nothing but their sword

544
00:33:07,491 --> 00:33:08,510
and their cape.

545
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:12,980
But it is essential that they
should be able to live on their pay.

546
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:18,490
The man who devotes himself to war should
regard it as a religious order into

547
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:21,350
which he enters.
He should have nothing,

548
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:26,530
no other home than his troop and should
hold himself honored in his profession.

549
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:34,010
So there you go. All in, all in.

550
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:37,070
And when people always ask me,

551
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,640
especially when I was in about work
life balance and I'm like, Hey,

552
00:33:40,641 --> 00:33:43,700
oh I'm not the guy to talk
about not the good person,

553
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,300
especially when I was in the military
because this was me. You know,

554
00:33:47,301 --> 00:33:50,750
my number one priority hundred percent
was the dames and everything else was

555
00:33:50,751 --> 00:33:54,350
just kind of, hey, you're everyone
else's along for the ride.

556
00:33:54,351 --> 00:33:55,880
But I know where I'm going.

557
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:01,420
So the being that devoted to war and
it has a power that has a certain,

558
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,400
it made, you know, if you've got a guy
that's thinking about all the time,

559
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:12,500
I think it was jade, jade and I were
talking about something and he said,

560
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:17,270
the person who cares more wins.
Yeah, that's, that's accurate.

561
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:22,160
And I want a lot of stuff in my day
just because I cared more. I mean,

562
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:24,920
I'm not going to sleep. I'm not, I'm
just going to be thinking about this.

563
00:34:24,921 --> 00:34:29,921
You're going to go home and this weekend
you're going to go and do a family

564
00:34:30,741 --> 00:34:34,760
barbecue and you're going
to go play baseball with the
kids and blah, blah, blah.

565
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:37,490
And I was just like, no, I'm just
going to be doing this all weekend.

566
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,680
I'm going to be working on this.
We're going to win. I'm, I got, um,

567
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:43,980
I care about this. Nothing
else matters. So that's, uh,

568
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,930
again, is it healthy for
work life balance? No,

569
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:52,670
it's not healthy except for to say,
if you're that committed to your work,

570
00:34:52,671 --> 00:34:53,481
you're a committed person,

571
00:34:53,481 --> 00:34:54,890
then that means you're trying
to take care of your family.

572
00:34:54,891 --> 00:34:57,700
That's not necessarily a bad
thing. Am I reaching maybe? Yeah,

573
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,080
I think I'm reaching.
That's fine. You know,

574
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:03,914
Marissa,

575
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,570
a good independent woman that doesn't
need emotional support from you all the

576
00:35:08,571 --> 00:35:11,240
time, so that she understands that.
That was the big thing for me.

577
00:35:11,241 --> 00:35:16,241
I think my wife understood that it
wasn't meant as an offensive thing.

578
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,503
Yeah.

579
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:21,710
I have a job and I
really care about my job.

580
00:35:21,711 --> 00:35:23,150
Doesn't mean I don't care about you,

581
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,210
but my job is right now and
I need to do that. Yeah,

582
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:31,070
and even the work life balance. My
just a bad husband. No, no, because no,

583
00:35:31,071 --> 00:35:34,010
because there is no
templated time allotted.

584
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:37,800
You know that you need to spend with
these people or those people are at work

585
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:41,280
versus fat. There's no like thing. You
know, sometimes if you're like, hey,

586
00:35:41,281 --> 00:35:44,490
I need to spend more time with
my wife. Your wife's like, Bro,

587
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,990
go do leave me alone. You know? Like we,
we spent the weekend again, calm down,

588
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:52,080
you know, go to work or whatever. Some
people like that and it's a spectrum.

589
00:35:52,081 --> 00:35:55,620
So work life balance is like,
it depends on your wife and you know,

590
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:59,340
in a husband wife situation I suppose
instead of instead of trying to take a

591
00:35:59,341 --> 00:36:01,380
life work life balance lesson out of this,

592
00:36:01,381 --> 00:36:03,240
I think the most important
thing to take out of this is,

593
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,170
is the level of commitment,
right?

594
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:08,570
If you really want to be successful
and not just talking about Warren,

595
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,050
I'm talking about business,
I'm talking about life.

596
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,790
If you really want to be successful, you
got to, you got to get after it. Yeah.

597
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,050
And you see this set the other things
aside for now, just the way it is. Yeah.

598
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:22,440
Yeah. Sorry. All right. Back to the book.

599
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:26,520
Training drill is necessary to make
the soldier steady and skillful,

600
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:31,550
although it does not warrant exclusive
attention among all the elements of war

601
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,730
is it even is the one
that deserves the least.

602
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,450
If one accepts those which are dangerous,

603
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,810
I tried to figure out what that meant.
I just thought opium.

604
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,960
That was an opium hit right there.
The last part,

605
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,120
the foundation of training depends. Oh,
this is good but, but okay, so drill.

606
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:54,930
If you know anything about the military
drill, especially back in those days,

607
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,130
it was a really was a necessary thing
because you had to function together as a

608
00:36:59,131 --> 00:36:59,881
team and the way you do that,

609
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:03,660
and we still do what's called close order
drill in the military now you've seen

610
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:07,800
it go watch the US Marine Corps
close order, silent drill team.

611
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:11,400
They do all these really
specific maneuvers and they
have competitions in high

612
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:14,550
schools between the ROTC classes where
you know you're carrying the rifle,

613
00:37:14,551 --> 00:37:17,380
you spin, you do that, all that
stuff. That's called drill. Yeah.

614
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:21,420
The reason it originated is because you
needed to for two reasons. Number one,

615
00:37:21,421 --> 00:37:25,170
you actually had to do those motions
on the battlefield, raise your rifle,

616
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,630
you know, load, remake, ready, aim, fire,

617
00:37:27,631 --> 00:37:29,460
and then the next rank will be doing
the same thing you had to do in a

618
00:37:29,461 --> 00:37:33,900
coordinated method. And the other
reason that they kept doing it,

619
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,990
according to my drill instructor
in officer candidate school,

620
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:42,630
Gunnery Sergeant United States Marine
Corps, all the enough last name was seals.

621
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:48,090
That was his last name. Great Guy.
Yeah, layers, gunnery sergeant seals,

622
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,800
my drum instructor

623
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,450
from the United States Marine Corps
at officer candidate school. He said,

624
00:37:54,451 --> 00:37:57,720
the reason that you're learning this
drill is because the reason that we do

625
00:37:57,721 --> 00:38:01,920
drill is it because people need
to act instantly upon orders.

626
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:03,230
So it,

627
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:07,470
it drills into you a level of obedience
when you get told by the left flank

628
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:11,730
march, everyone goes by the right
flank, March, everyone goes, you know,

629
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:13,530
so it teaches you that hey,
I'm going to go.

630
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,140
And that's what they used to use it for.
But they still use it now too.

631
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,960
So that people get used to the
immediate obedience of orders.

632
00:38:18,961 --> 00:38:22,410
Now does that get contradicted by things
that I talk about all the time on here,

633
00:38:22,411 --> 00:38:24,660
but questioning orders and making sure
you understand why you're doing. Yeah,

634
00:38:24,661 --> 00:38:28,930
it does. Absolutely. But
there is a, that's why. That's
what it exists for. Yeah.

635
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,790
Yeah. And at least the capabilities
and the capability is there. Yes,

636
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,520
the capability is there.
Back to the book,

637
00:38:36,521 --> 00:38:40,870
the foundation of training depends
on the legs and not the arms.

638
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:48,600
All the mystery of maneuvers and combat
is in the legs and it is to the legs

639
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,910
that we should apply ourselves,

640
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:56,970
whoever claims otherwise is but a fool
and not only in the elements of what is

641
00:38:57,191 --> 00:38:59,710
called the profession of arms.

642
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:04,770
So interestingly your personal problem
with people that talk about skipping leg

643
00:39:06,701 --> 00:39:10,210
day, the, it goes back,
it goes back to here.

644
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:16,000
The big guns, the big arms, they didn't
want to help us in the, in the art of war,

645
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,880
according to Zach's in Hawaii
they call it big for nothing,

646
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:23,710
actually big for nothing in Hawaiian
means like I guess here they say all go no

647
00:39:23,711 --> 00:39:24,544
shell.
Right.

648
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:29,860
So that's kind of what having big arms
and small legs kind of is as well.

649
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,500
Right through. Now you're on
board with that. Well yeah.

650
00:39:32,501 --> 00:39:34,270
No I never was skipping legs day.

651
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:38,650
You're the one teasing me
and I was wondering why is
that so funny? But I guess,

652
00:39:38,651 --> 00:39:43,100
yeah, that that's fine.
Cause you look like a fool.

653
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:48,910
That's it. That's the answer. Dang it
goes back. It was back a long time.

654
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,090
Even back then people were skipping
leg day. Yeah cause they were fools.

655
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:56,950
I'm focusing on the wrong thing and it
makes sense. Even like in those terms,

656
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,140
it makes sense today.
Let me tell you something.

657
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,400
The the amount we can,
when I was in the team,

658
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,040
so I was running training and
I still talked guys obviously,

659
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,640
but if you think about what's going
on the train like people to people,

660
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,960
you know, I say all the time, like all
of the seal training is not that hard.

661
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,600
Right? I say old time, like
when I'm talking about buds,

662
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,850
I'm telling you the advanced
training that you go to,

663
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,260
the training that I used to run it,
it's, it's freaking really hard.

664
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,910
It's really hard. You're in the desert.
The desert. No, don't think of sand.

665
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,990
Think of rocks. Think of jagged,
uneven terrain up and down hills.

666
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:37,330
Then think about you're on night vision,
so it's at night. Think about, you have,

667
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:42,310
let's call it about 80 pounds
of gear on just on average.

668
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,680
That's like the average guy's
got 80 pounds of gear on.

669
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:49,810
You're going to get dropped off in
the middle of the desert. Again,

670
00:40:49,811 --> 00:40:53,890
not the desert, but the
rocky, what's it called? Sub?

671
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,260
I forget. It's, it's
the rocky crazy terrain.

672
00:40:59,261 --> 00:41:01,660
It's hard to walk on in the daytime.
It's hard to walk on.

673
00:41:01,661 --> 00:41:04,660
Now you're at the yard at night. Now you
have night vision on, which is great,

674
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:08,980
but my vision is looking far away and
you can adjust one of your night vision

675
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,530
side. So you have to, and you can
adjust one to foreign, one to close,

676
00:41:12,531 --> 00:41:15,280
so you can see a little bit, but still
your peripheral vision isn't there.

677
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:18,820
Your peripheral vision is gone because
there's a tube in front of your head,

678
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:22,060
so you can't really see what's
actually underneath your feet.

679
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,130
You can look down and then
you can see it for a second,

680
00:41:24,131 --> 00:41:25,720
but you can't walk around
looking down the whole time.

681
00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:28,240
You got to look the guy in front of
you got to look at your field of fire.

682
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:33,130
So as you're walking, you're making
these micro adjustments all the time,

683
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,990
adapt to your foot,
hitting the ground in some weird spot.

684
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:39,710
And so you get that and then you have
that weight on your back and so you get

685
00:41:39,711 --> 00:41:44,360
dropped off. Then you patrol 10
kilometers, 10 kilometers maybe.

686
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:47,810
What's that? That's six miles.
So, so you're going six miles,

687
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:51,410
then you get six miles. You get to a
target area, you get to the target area.

688
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:54,500
You got to get eyes on the target area.
You know you'd get eyes on,

689
00:41:54,501 --> 00:41:59,330
you climbed the biggest halo round
at night, being as quiet as you can.

690
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,580
You get to the top of that hill,
you look at it,

691
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:05,150
then you go and assault the target.
Once you assault the target,

692
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:05,901
guess what you're going for?

693
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:08,420
When you're and the target you
are now like almost running.

694
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,940
You're running through the thing at night.
You're shooting machine guns.

695
00:42:10,941 --> 00:42:13,250
Guess what, guys? Get hit. Guys
go down. This. Even in training,

696
00:42:13,251 --> 00:42:15,140
guys are going down now you're
going to carry him. Well,

697
00:42:15,141 --> 00:42:17,090
who are you going to carry him?
Who's gonna carry him? You are.

698
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,400
What are you going to do? How are you
going to carry him? You're going to,

699
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,700
there's only one way. Sure. Okay.
There's stretchers. There's you can be,

700
00:42:22,701 --> 00:42:24,800
you can bring litters and we
certainly bring litters in the field,

701
00:42:24,801 --> 00:42:27,440
but they take some time to set up and
you've got to get organized to make that

702
00:42:27,441 --> 00:42:27,950
happen.

703
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:32,060
What's going to happen
initially is somebody is going
to sling that dude on his

704
00:42:32,061 --> 00:42:33,440
back.
And by the way,

705
00:42:33,441 --> 00:42:35,720
that person that weighs 200 pounds
has 80 pounds of gear with them.

706
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,970
So now we're talking 280 pounds.

707
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:41,630
You're going to put that person on your
back and you're going to walk at a high

708
00:42:41,631 --> 00:42:45,230
rate of speed through this rocky terrain
and you're going to do that for another

709
00:42:45,231 --> 00:42:50,030
two to three miles to get out.
It's hard.

710
00:42:50,031 --> 00:42:54,910
That kind of training, and by the way,
this whole time there's no like who are,

711
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:58,490
there's no, hey, come on. There's
no, there's no, there's no,

712
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:03,530
you don't even speak it just in silence
and just going and everyone knows what

713
00:43:03,531 --> 00:43:04,364
you have to do.

714
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:09,440
And so that's why you got to do leg day,

715
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:14,870
not skip leg day because your legs, your
legs got to carry that weight. Yeah.

716
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:21,860
Going back to the book to return to
the march about which everyone bothers

717
00:43:21,861 --> 00:43:23,420
themselves to the death.

718
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:27,170
But we'll never reach a conclusion
unless I reveal a secret.

719
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:30,650
So he's got a secret about
maneuvering troops. This is this,

720
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:35,300
I found this interesting, some wish to
march slowly, others would march fast.

721
00:43:35,301 --> 00:43:40,301
But what about the troops whom no one
knows how to make march fast or slowly as

722
00:43:41,061 --> 00:43:45,800
the desire or as necessary and who
require an officer at every corner to make

723
00:43:45,801 --> 00:43:49,850
them turn like some snails
and others are running.

724
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,990
And this is to advance this column,
which is always trailing.

725
00:43:53,991 --> 00:43:57,020
It is a common unit to see even
a battalion to commence movement.

726
00:43:57,021 --> 00:44:00,530
So what he's talking about,
if you're moving with a unit,

727
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,900
and this happens with even
happens with a platoon,

728
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:06,140
but it definitely happens when
you get bigger elements, you know,

729
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:10,190
a company sized element where you've
got a hundred people that are moving,

730
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:15,410
it's, it's uh, the caterpillar
effect, right? Like the front moves.

731
00:44:15,411 --> 00:44:17,840
And then it takes a little
while for people to catch
up and then when they stop,

732
00:44:17,841 --> 00:44:20,600
everyone bumps into him and you end
up with this just thing that's really,

733
00:44:20,601 --> 00:44:24,800
really hard to move. Yeah, and this is so,

734
00:44:24,801 --> 00:44:28,520
this is how he says,
this is his big secret,

735
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:30,500
shall I say it,

736
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:34,740
this great word which comprises all
the mystery of the art and which,

737
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:38,190
which will no doubt be seen as ridiculous,

738
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:40,980
have them march in cadence.

739
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:48,090
That is why these musical marches were
instituted and that is why one beats the

740
00:44:48,091 --> 00:44:48,760
drum.

741
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:53,640
It is this which no one knows and
no one has perceived with this.

742
00:44:53,641 --> 00:44:57,930
You can march fast or slow as you wish.
The tail will not lose the distance.

743
00:44:57,931 --> 00:44:59,940
All your soldiers will
start on the same foot.

744
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:04,470
The changes of direction will be made
together with speed and grace and the legs

745
00:45:04,471 --> 00:45:06,180
of your soldiers will not get tangled up.

746
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:10,590
You will not be forced to halt after each
turn in order to start off on the same

747
00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:11,010
foot.

748
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:15,870
Your soldiers will not exhaust themselves
at quarter as much as that presence.

749
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:21,900
Now, what I thought was interesting about
that is it's an obvious answer, right?

750
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:22,321
And now,

751
00:45:22,321 --> 00:45:25,830
clearly you're not going to do that in
the modern day military in the field.

752
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,840
You're not going to play music.

753
00:45:27,841 --> 00:45:30,870
So guys could march to it
so you can stay in Caden's.

754
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,460
But I think it's more important to that.
Sometimes we lose things,

755
00:45:35,461 --> 00:45:39,960
we lose methods who they're
in front of our face,

756
00:45:39,961 --> 00:45:42,240
but we don't understand why they were
there. And I'll say, I'll tell you,

757
00:45:42,241 --> 00:45:43,110
I was thinking of a story.

758
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:49,080
I was running training and
one of my guys who was,

759
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,500
uh,
one of the assistant platoon commanders,

760
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:57,210
Entu bruiser great guy. Hard
to choke, real long neck,

761
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:02,520
you know, you can make it happen.
You're going to work for it real.

762
00:46:02,521 --> 00:46:06,750
Is it some people you might think long
neck, easy to choke, right? Yeah, no,

763
00:46:06,751 --> 00:46:09,230
this was, his neck was so
long and he was strong too.

764
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:12,100
He is dark long and strong Max.

765
00:46:12,101 --> 00:46:17,070
So his neck would like band and the gaiety
keep breathing. Yeah, it was that long.

766
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,680
It was a long neck.
So anyways,

767
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:23,550
we were out at this training site
and we were doing, he was his,

768
00:46:23,551 --> 00:46:26,610
it was his platoon now he was a platoon
commander and they were coming over the

769
00:46:26,611 --> 00:46:31,611
beach and meaning swimming over the beach
and then you go do live fire and this

770
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:34,530
really, so, so they're doing it,

771
00:46:34,531 --> 00:46:39,531
they're doing iterations and he's
coming up on the beach and is a weapons,

772
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:43,320
you know, you, you, when you get to
the beach, your weapons Wet Sandy,

773
00:46:43,321 --> 00:46:46,380
cause you go through the surf and it's
all jacked up and then you try and shoot

774
00:46:46,381 --> 00:46:48,660
your gun and it doesn't work. You've
got to clean it and it's just a pain.

775
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,000
And he says,
Hey man,

776
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:56,580
do you have any like suggestions on how
to get my weapon firing once I get over

777
00:46:56,581 --> 00:46:59,430
the beach? And I go, yeah
man, don't let it get wet.

778
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,380
And he was kind of, you know, like really?
And I said, yeah, don't let it get wet.

779
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:09,030
Because when you're swimming in, you've
got a rucksack. But the rucksack isn't,

780
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,240
it's, it's waterproofed.
So it kind of floats.

781
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:16,650
And so you can put your weapon on top of
your rucksack and you can kind of keep

782
00:47:16,651 --> 00:47:18,360
it try there. And when you're
just swimming, you just keep it.

783
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,580
Now you're not going to keep
your weapon completely dry.

784
00:47:20,581 --> 00:47:25,560
It's not going to happen. It's
going to get wet. But the attitude,

785
00:47:25,561 --> 00:47:28,470
if you have the attitude that
you're trying to keep it dry,

786
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:33,770
you'll keep it 90% more dry
than you would otherwise.

787
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,460
And most important when
you come through the beach,

788
00:47:36,461 --> 00:47:40,030
when you come through the waves,
you won't let it get the sand in it.

789
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,310
And he kind of looked at me with a
funny face of like, are you seriously?

790
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:47,290
How can you keep it dry?
And I said, keep it dry.

791
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:50,140
Next time I'm watching
him or on night vision,

792
00:47:50,141 --> 00:47:53,140
I'm watching him and sure enough way is
his weapon barely went in the water and

793
00:47:53,141 --> 00:47:57,160
he got up on the beach and boom, it works.
Guess what? That's an obvious answer,

794
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,140
but sometimes people,

795
00:47:59,141 --> 00:48:02,020
we know we just need to have somebody
share the obvious answer with us so that

796
00:48:02,021 --> 00:48:05,950
we can execute. Yeah,
no, that makes sense.

797
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:08,890
The thing is that day.
And that's crazy.

798
00:48:08,891 --> 00:48:12,670
I didn't know that that marching thing
like that's why he marched the cadence

799
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:18,910
that caterpillar affects shuts down.
Why there's traffic by the way,

800
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:23,350
traffic exists because of that
little effect. That's exactly true.

801
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,160
You know one guy,

802
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,890
one guy going and the reaction time and
the other funny thing he said in here is

803
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,650
he says,
go watch people dance.

804
00:48:29,651 --> 00:48:34,330
You see a soldier dance all night but
he can't march for more than an hour

805
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:37,300
without being tired. Why is that?
Give him some music. Kind of funny.

806
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:42,700
I didn't want to say that part cause then
people started asking me about dancing

807
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:46,090
today. Then we'll see you Dan. No,
no talk of dance on the podcast.

808
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:48,970
Back to the book.

809
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:53,320
If the previous war had lasted
a little longer in do boobly,

810
00:48:53,321 --> 00:48:55,660
everyone would've fought a hand to hand.

811
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:59,860
This was because the abusive
firing began to be appreciated.

812
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:04,890
It causes more noise than harm and those
who depend on it are always beaten.

813
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,290
So what do you mean?
I can encapsulate a lot of stuff?

814
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:13,060
What he was talking about was how everyone
was so excited to shoot their rifles.

815
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:15,760
And at this time period,
the rifles weren't all that accurate.

816
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:18,640
And so it was a bunch of noise,
but they weren't always that effective.

817
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,550
And it would be better. And
by the way, when you, when
you had to shoot your rifle,

818
00:49:21,551 --> 00:49:26,350
you had to stop. So now instead of
charging, we're stopping, we're loading,

819
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:30,370
we're firing, the other rank is firing.
And if the other people are moving on you,

820
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:32,920
well they're going to get close enough
and they're going to have no now momentum

821
00:49:32,921 --> 00:49:35,890
and they're going to overtake you or
they're going to overpower you with what?

822
00:49:35,891 --> 00:49:37,660
With bayonets and hand to hand combat.

823
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:42,760
So what I thought was interesting
about this is he saying, hey,

824
00:49:42,761 --> 00:49:45,460
all this noise,
it's basically noisemakers

825
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:50,680
for PR for all practical purposes.
Their noisemakers and he's saying,

826
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:54,760
and what I was thinking
was, it's, this goes to be,

827
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:59,860
this to me is very similar to people
that yell a lot, right? You yell a lot,

828
00:49:59,861 --> 00:50:01,780
you are someone that's loud,
someone that's always talking to him.

829
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,660
And he says that people who
depended on that are always beaten.

830
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:07,510
And I thought to myself,
that's a very accurate statement.

831
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,760
Very accurate statement.

832
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:16,740
So don't just talk for the
purpose of talking, right?

833
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:20,530
Don't. If you don't have anything to say,
that's fine. Be Quiet. Don't say anything.

834
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:23,780
It's actually good
here.

835
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,750
He talks about the Roman legions.

836
00:50:25,751 --> 00:50:28,760
The Romans vanquished all
nations by their discipline.

837
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,033
Okay,

838
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:32,330
no big deal.
No,

839
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:37,250
they meditated on war constantly,
continually,

840
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:43,160
and they always renounced old
costumes whenever they found better.

841
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,110
In this respect,

842
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:49,040
they differed from the Gauls whom they
defeated during several centuries without

843
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:51,110
the ladder thinking of
correcting their errors.

844
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:55,880
So this is clearly the Romans. Okay?
We know discipline's important.

845
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:56,870
Talk about it all the time.

846
00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:02,110
But more important lesson here is they
always renounced old costumes whenever

847
00:51:02,631 --> 00:51:03,980
they found better.
Boom.

848
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:05,863
Hmm.

849
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:08,880
Renounced the old customs.
When you find better ones,

850
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:10,830
this is something you
need to do in your life.

851
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:12,900
It's something that needs
you and your business.

852
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:17,300
It's something you needed
to do on the mat. Okay?

853
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,950
And I'll tell you,
going back to the other part,

854
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:25,990
sometimes there's things in Jujitsu that
you find a better way and they work for

855
00:51:25,991 --> 00:51:30,700
awhile and then you go back to the old
way and it works because people are

856
00:51:30,701 --> 00:51:35,550
expecting the new way the dean talks to
you and say this is a new old move. Yeah,

857
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,790
yeah. He just said that the end
of the day is a new old move. It,

858
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:43,810
it worked 10 years ago. It wouldn't work
five years ago because everyone knew it.

859
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,450
Now it'll work again cause
everyone forgot it. Yeah.

860
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:50,350
And that's kind of like everyone forgot
why, why we use cadence, why we use music.

861
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:52,930
Yeah. We forgot why. We don't
know how to March now. Yeah.

862
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,370
Yeah.
It's,

863
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:58,910
and it's essentially the same reason why
the new move will work because people

864
00:51:58,911 --> 00:52:01,440
are unfamiliar, you know, cause you know,

865
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:05,430
you have a certain attack or whatever
and then the more people know about that

866
00:52:05,431 --> 00:52:08,040
attack, the harder it is to,
to be successful with it.

867
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,910
And then you find some new variation
then that not everyone knows.

868
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:15,410
The football game kind of was like
that too, for a little bit. Uh,

869
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,850
and then after awhile,

870
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:22,740
all those fundamentals which work
essentially the early version of the,

871
00:52:22,741 --> 00:52:25,350
of the move. Yeah. Whatever.
That's still there.

872
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:28,800
But we've got this new unrevealed move
that's getting everyone because they're

873
00:52:28,801 --> 00:52:32,130
unfamiliar. It's like us, a surprise
kind of where they're just unfamiliar.

874
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:35,550
And then now everyone gets familiar with
it and it's like, cool. It was okay. Move.

875
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:39,390
Yeah. But the real good one was that
original though. Do you want yeah,

876
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:40,253
but everyone just got you

877
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:42,610
do it. Yeah. And then once
everyone gets used to the new one,

878
00:52:42,611 --> 00:52:46,600
they'll forget about the old
one. Yeah, for sure. Correct.

879
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:47,740
And improve.

880
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,210
Renounce your old customers
whenever you find better.

881
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,660
Now he talking a little
bit about peace time

882
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:02,600
and how you maintain your army during
peace time. He says, as for the cavalry,

883
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:05,660
it should never be touched,
meaning you shouldn't,

884
00:53:05,661 --> 00:53:07,670
you shouldn't get rid
of any cavalry people.

885
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:11,000
The old troopers and the
old horses are the good,

886
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,510
and the recruits of either
are absolutely useless.

887
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:16,700
It is a burden and it is it an expense,

888
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:20,390
but as indispensable in
regard to the infantry.

889
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:25,980
As long as there are a few old heads
you can do what you want with the tails.

890
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:31,940
So a horseman is you got the skilled
horse and you've got the skilled horse

891
00:53:32,191 --> 00:53:33,870
rider and he says in this,
I dunno if I'll read it,

892
00:53:33,871 --> 00:53:37,230
but then he says he also in here it
takes 10 years to make a good a good

893
00:53:37,231 --> 00:53:40,950
cavalryman good guide. It's really good
on the horse with a really good horse,

894
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:43,950
takes 10 years to make them.
So you can't just get rid of that person.

895
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:47,730
But an infantry man, if you've got some
good, this is what I liked about it.

896
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:52,410
If you've got good leadership, good
leadership with infantry men, hey man,

897
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,360
there's some fundamental skills
you're gonna need to learn.

898
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:57,090
It will be ready to rock and
roll, which is, which is awesome.

899
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:02,700
Good leadership goes a long way. I
mean, and again, you have to have,

900
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:03,420
it takes a lot.

901
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:08,420
It takes the same amount of time to make
a good at infantry leader because those

902
00:54:08,761 --> 00:54:12,660
are skills that take a long time to
develop to become a leader of infantry

903
00:54:12,661 --> 00:54:16,950
troops. But your basic combat rifleman,
you can make them pretty quick,

904
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,330
not like it's all,

905
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:21,900
it's a hell of a lot easier than
making someone that can ride a horse.

906
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,460
So, and then your leadership's
gonna go a long way

907
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:33,480
back to the book.
In attacking infantry,

908
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:38,880
the two rear ranks are to lower
their pikes in this position,

909
00:54:38,881 --> 00:54:42,690
the pikes will extend from six to
seven feet ahead of the front rank.

910
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:48,060
The front ranks being sheltered in such
a manner will I am sure aim with more

911
00:54:48,061 --> 00:54:52,500
confidence than if they had nothing
in front of them. Besides this,

912
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,490
the third rank can ward off
blows and defend the first rank,

913
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,780
which we'll do,

914
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:01,860
which it will do much better since
it is covered by the first two ranks.

915
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:05,790
The second rank,
which is armed with muskets,

916
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,780
can fire and defend the man in
front of him in the first rank.

917
00:55:09,781 --> 00:55:12,510
Without the ladder being obliged to stoop.

918
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,610
This avoids a serious disadvantage which
has incurred in kneeling a dangerous

919
00:55:17,611 --> 00:55:21,330
movement because men who are
afraid prefer this position,

920
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:26,630
they cannot be made to get up when
wanted and is always necessary to halt,

921
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,910
to kneel according to my formation.

922
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:35,270
All the men are covered each by each
other with reciprocal confidence.

923
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,250
The front presents a forest of spears
that are parents is formidable and gives

924
00:55:41,251 --> 00:55:45,090
confidence to your own troops
because they feel its power.

925
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:47,400
So a couple of interesting things there.

926
00:55:47,401 --> 00:55:51,210
Obviously it's a cover moves
situation and, and, and
we're going to work that out.

927
00:55:51,211 --> 00:55:56,000
But I thought beyond that,
it was interesting that if you've got,

928
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:58,620
if you're going to take a knee, well
there's two things that are happening.

929
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:02,070
Number one, you have to stop to take a
knee. We're not advancing on our knees.

930
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:06,000
And number two people that are afraid
they want to be down there and it can be

931
00:56:06,001 --> 00:56:08,010
hard to get them back up.
So don't even let them get down there,

932
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:10,800
keep that momentum going.

933
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,950
We're looking to keep that momentum going
back to the book,

934
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:21,360
those who imagine that,
and I think I stayed this every time,

935
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:24,720
usually around this point in the podcast,
I'm skipping a lot of the book. Sure.

936
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:27,370
It's just the way it is. We're not
going to read the whole book on here.

937
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:31,150
You have to order it yourself.
If you want to hear every secret of sacks,

938
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:38,360
those who imagined that the Roman legions
were composed of Romans from Rome are

939
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:42,440
very much deceived. They came
from all the nations in the world,

940
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:44,840
but their composition,
their discipline,

941
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:49,250
and their methods of fighting or
better than all those other nations.

942
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:51,650
This is why they conquered them all.

943
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:57,400
Neither were they conquered in their
turn on until this discipline had to

944
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:03,960
generated among the Romans.
Discipline.

945
00:57:03,961 --> 00:57:08,280
We'll get you a long way and lack
of discipline will get you killed.

946
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:13,330
Disintegrated. It disintegrated.
Talking more about cavalry here.

947
00:57:13,331 --> 00:57:18,331
The cavalry should be active and
mounted on horses in nerd to fatigue.

948
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:24,310
It should be encumbered with as little
baggage as possible and above all should

949
00:57:24,311 --> 00:57:27,820
not make the common error
of having fat horses.

950
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:29,240
Yeah.

951
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:33,410
If they could see an enemy every day,
it would only be better for this.

952
00:57:33,411 --> 00:57:36,380
Would soon put them in
condition to attempt anything.

953
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:38,150
Yeah.

954
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:42,050
It is certain that the power of power
of cavalry is not understood. Why?

955
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,570
Because of we have love for fat horses.

956
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:51,020
I had a regimen of German cavalry in
Poland with which I marched more than 1500

957
00:57:51,021 --> 00:57:52,670
leagues in 18 months.

958
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:58,160
I maintain that this regiment was more
fit for service at the end of this time

959
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:01,070
than another supplied with fat horses.

960
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,620
But to reach this condition,

961
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:08,830
they must be gradually accustomed to
hardship and hardened by Hans and violent

962
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:10,490
exercise.

963
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:15,830
This will maintain their health and
increase their endurance. Likewise,

964
00:58:15,831 --> 00:58:20,831
it will make cavalry men of the troopers
and give them a Marshall bearing.

965
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:25,460
So you got to train hard. Hmm.

966
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:28,360
I just read all that to basically say,
you got to train hard.

967
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:30,580
Even want to be ready to fight.
You've got to trade how your fight

968
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:35,020
and don't get on a fat a horse.
Apparently.

969
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,970
We'll have to ask my wife about that one.

970
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:41,230
She knows more about horses than me
or Lafe. Lafe knows about horses.

971
00:58:41,231 --> 00:58:46,210
He's from Texas. Everyone from Texas
rides a horse. Yeah. Is that the image?

972
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:48,670
Yes. When I go, when I would go overseas,

973
00:58:48,671 --> 00:58:52,120
people for everyone in America is
basically carrying a pistol on him at all

974
00:58:52,121 --> 00:58:56,080
times. That's, that's the, that's the
image that people have of America.

975
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:58,900
I liked that image for people
to have America too. I mean,

976
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:03,160
I'm sure some people don't like
that image, but yeah. You know,

977
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:06,190
be nice when you come here, you can
want to come and visit. That's cool.

978
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,770
We welcome visitors.
Just be nice. Everyone's,

979
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:11,440
everyone's carrying a
45 in their back pocket.

980
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:18,610
Yeah.
Can you carry a 45 in your back pocket?

981
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:23,140
You could. I mean, would it recommended no
one recommended you get a holster? Yeah.

982
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:27,380
Yeah. Yeah. So, but it's more
of an expression. No, no.
It's not even an expression,

983
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:29,300
but if you go to another country,

984
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,610
they think that we've just
got them in our back pocket.

985
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:35,230
Like you carry your wallet and a 45 yeah.
What?

986
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:41,210
You see where I'm coming from here?
Yes. Is how we roll Miz America.

987
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:43,550
Okay.

988
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:44,840
I do not.
Back to the book.

989
00:59:44,841 --> 00:59:49,841
I do not know why armor has been laid
aside for the for nothing is either so

990
00:59:50,811 --> 00:59:54,530
useful or ornamental.
If it be considered,

991
00:59:54,531 --> 00:59:58,250
how many troopers perish by the
sword and how many are are? How many?

992
00:59:58,251 --> 01:00:01,850
Many are dangerously wounded
by random and weak shots.

993
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:05,810
Accident accidents against which
armor guarantees protection.

994
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:08,600
One cannot avoid acknowledging
the benefits of it.

995
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:15,080
It is nothing but indolence and relaxation
of discipline that caused it to be

996
01:00:15,081 --> 01:00:16,070
laid aside.

997
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:22,180
It is worrisome to carry a queer ass and
I'll trail pike and trail a pike half a

998
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:27,230
century to use it a single day,

999
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:31,580
but as soon as disciplined
as neglected in the nation.

1000
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,430
As soon as comfort becomes an aim,

1001
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:39,920
it needs no inspiration to foretell.
That ruin is near

1002
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:47,240
the Romans conquered all peoples by
their discipline in the measure that it

1003
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:49,470
became corrupted,

1004
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:54,650
their success decreased when the emperor
Gracian permitted the legions to quit

1005
01:00:56,100 --> 01:01:01,100
their cure asses and helmets because the
soldiers complain they were too heavy.

1006
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:02,550
All was lost.

1007
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:07,020
The ball bearings whom they had defeated
during so many centuries vanquish them.

1008
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,030
Well, that's all. That's all.

1009
01:01:12,031 --> 01:01:16,050
People stop wearing their armor because
it's heavy. Body armor is heavy.

1010
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,493
Yeah.

1011
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:22,580
Helmet your helmets heavy. Yeah.
You want that? A little tiny helmet.

1012
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:25,490
You want the whole, the take out the
back plate of our body armor. Oh,

1013
01:01:25,491 --> 01:01:27,890
probably won't get shot
there. No. Yeah. Was it,

1014
01:01:27,891 --> 01:01:32,540
who was taught was that Jody thought
talking about that like, oh my God. Yeah.

1015
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:36,470
Though those guys going into that, they
will, they were going into an operation.

1016
01:01:36,471 --> 01:01:38,670
They didn't wear their body armor.
Yeah. Cause they were like, Dang it,

1017
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:43,370
we're not going to happen. Oh, pasta we
plus we w we light and maneuverable. Hmm.

1018
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:47,840
That's the thing you say. Yeah. Yeah. It's
like skipping your workout and saying,

1019
01:01:47,841 --> 01:01:51,140
well I need to rest it. Like recovery
today. Yeah. Kind of the same thing.

1020
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:55,910
Very similar. Yes. I'll give
you that one where I go. Yeah.

1021
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,560
He obviously,
um,

1022
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,130
as soon as discipline is
neglected in a nation,

1023
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:03,920
guess what's the same thing with
your personal life? Obviously

1024
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:09,950
back to the book or the trooper should
have a goatskin bottle like those used in

1025
01:02:09,951 --> 01:02:13,130
hot countries instead of a canteen
or a barrel to hold liquors in.

1026
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,910
Traded this with his linen stockings,

1027
01:02:16,911 --> 01:02:21,660
cap a cord and a other necessities is
to be putting the bottom of a sack which

1028
01:02:21,661 --> 01:02:25,890
will roll up with his coat and can be
fastened with two straps behind him.

1029
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:29,400
This will reduce the monstrous load
which has now carried by the cavalry.

1030
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:34,290
It is necessary from time to time to
inspect the baggage and forced the men to

1031
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:36,150
throw away useless items.

1032
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:40,950
I have frequently donut one can hardly
imagine all the trash they carry with

1033
01:02:40,951 --> 01:02:44,010
them year after year.
The poor horse has to carry everything.

1034
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:48,390
It is no exaggeration to say that I have
filled 20 wagons with useless rubbish,

1035
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:51,330
which I have found in the
review of a single regimen.

1036
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,920
So people will tend to carry a lot,

1037
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,840
a lot that they don't need.
And that weighs down on you.

1038
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,950
I think I've talked about this before,
but the backend broken to do.

1039
01:03:04,951 --> 01:03:08,270
We had these winter paltunes
tunes, which I never did one, uh,

1040
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:09,690
out on the east coast,

1041
01:03:09,691 --> 01:03:14,691
they had these winter platoons and you're
going long distance on cross country

1042
01:03:16,081 --> 01:03:19,290
skis. Right. You know what
those are? Yeah. It long,

1043
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:23,550
long distances and that is a very,
you're basically like running a marathon.

1044
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:28,620
And so the guys were super anal about
the weight that they carry to me.

1045
01:03:28,621 --> 01:03:32,940
Yeah. So like they would, you know how
the backpack, a backpack has, you know,

1046
01:03:32,941 --> 01:03:34,920
a strap that you pull,
you pulled a tightknit,

1047
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:37,140
they'd get it to the port
where it was supposed to be,

1048
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:40,080
give it a little bit second and cut
director, cut the rest off. And so it's,

1049
01:03:40,081 --> 01:03:42,630
they don't want to carry that
little extra four inches of nylon,

1050
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:43,853
not going to do it.

1051
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:46,900
They had every piece of gear that
they had would be like that. Yeah.

1052
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,910
Dope to warriors at team to truth.

1053
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:54,900
Here's an interesting thing
in passing through water,

1054
01:03:54,901 --> 01:03:57,240
the horses must never be allowed to drink.

1055
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:58,490
Okay.

1056
01:03:58,490 --> 01:04:02,600
A man who holds to water, his horse will
stop a whole army. When this happens,

1057
01:04:02,601 --> 01:04:06,680
the officers should hasten to the spot
and instead of fruitless reprimands and

1058
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:11,030
ill timed mercy, they should
instantly chastise the offender.

1059
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:12,100
Okay.

1060
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:15,130
Nothing is of such importance for
the preservation of the cavalry.

1061
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:16,980
Okay.

1062
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:21,210
Otherwise, the affection the
men they have for their horses,

1063
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:24,300
we'll have them halting little or much,

1064
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:28,500
and then it is impossible for them
to recover their ranks without gallon

1065
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:31,533
discipline.

1066
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:36,430
People get that little affection
further for not just, you know,

1067
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,420
I wasn't thinking horses here.

1068
01:04:37,421 --> 01:04:40,990
I was thinking about like being on
a long patrol or in the workplace.

1069
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:44,320
You want your team to
go and every time you,

1070
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:47,200
you grant that little bit of mercy.
Right?

1071
01:04:48,610 --> 01:04:51,790
Am I saying be merciless straight?
Same driver? No, but when you do it,

1072
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:55,360
you start develop that trend and now it
throws other things off and sometimes

1073
01:04:55,361 --> 01:04:58,720
you just gotta be, Hey, no, be
quiet and execute. Yeah, got to go.

1074
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:01,390
Got It.
Go

1075
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:08,170
in time of peace. And in winter
quarters, in time of war,

1076
01:05:08,171 --> 01:05:12,490
their horses should be kept in conditioned
by violent exercise or runs at least

1077
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:15,610
three times a week.
I like this idea of violent exercise.

1078
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:19,780
I'm going to start doing violent
exercising. Yeah, that's good.

1079
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:23,290
Like violent.
Exercising the same.

1080
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:28,291
Severe usage is also proper for the
heavy cavalry charge at those times.

1081
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:31,450
It is in the field.
It is only in the field,

1082
01:05:31,451 --> 01:05:36,400
but they must be managed carefully to
keep them in flesh and the squadrons

1083
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:39,310
complete and strong,
and this is interesting,

1084
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:44,670
the best chance of teaching them to
stand fire is when the infantry is

1085
01:05:44,861 --> 01:05:48,250
practicing.
They should advance on the fire and walk

1086
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:51,310
and be kept calm.

1087
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,970
Accosting accustoming them
to go closer and closer.

1088
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:58,270
They should never be beaten
but stroked and encouraged,

1089
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:00,490
encouraged in the space of a month.

1090
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:04,840
They will be so accustomed to it that
they will even put their nose on the

1091
01:06:04,841 --> 01:06:09,670
muzzle of the muskets without any fright
or surprise. Then they are all right.

1092
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:10,840
Nevertheless,

1093
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:14,230
they should not be allowed to approach
to close for once they get burned,

1094
01:06:14,231 --> 01:06:15,970
you will not be able to
bring them near again.

1095
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:21,580
This ordeal must be reserved for
the day of battle. That was good.

1096
01:06:21,581 --> 01:06:25,960
That to me reminded me of what Jordan
Peterson was talking about Ed way or the

1097
01:06:25,961 --> 01:06:30,130
warrior kid. How you slowly inoculate
people. You don't throw him into the F,

1098
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,860
you don't bring them right
up to the firing line and
start shooting the guns and

1099
01:06:32,861 --> 01:06:36,700
let them get freaked out horribly.
You bring them a little distance.

1100
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:39,580
He let them listen from afar and then
bring a little bit closer and then next

1101
01:06:39,581 --> 01:06:41,920
thing you know they're good to go.
They're standing in the line.

1102
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:46,060
What do you call that? What did Jordan
Peterson call that? Exposure? Yeah,

1103
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,720
gradual exposure.
Therapy exposures.

1104
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:53,400
Graduated exposure therapy.
Something. It's something, yeah,

1105
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:58,090
it was something like that until it
cover,

1106
01:06:58,091 --> 01:06:59,020
move a little bit of that.

1107
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:03,670
I am convinced every unit that is not
supported is a defeated organization.

1108
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:09,270
Infantry should always be supported by
cavalry and cavalry by infantry covered

1109
01:07:10,211 --> 01:07:14,260
move work together. Support.

1110
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:17,380
Here's a little note back to the book.

1111
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:21,250
The general or commander in chief of
an army should have a standard to be

1112
01:07:21,251 --> 01:07:24,670
carried ahead of him
as a mark of his rank,

1113
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:29,920
so he's talking about flags.
This is, this also has a purpose.

1114
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:33,010
Anyone searching for him will
know instantly where to find him,

1115
01:07:33,011 --> 01:07:36,370
especially in battle and the troops
seeing the standard will know that the

1116
01:07:36,371 --> 01:07:37,960
general is observing them.

1117
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:43,450
So one thing we did and they do
in the military as they, you,

1118
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,580
when you're giving your brief on
how the mission is going to go,

1119
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:48,850
you brief location of
leadership, there's a, Oh guys,

1120
01:07:48,851 --> 01:07:51,800
we're going to take down
these eight buildings. I'll
be here in this building, uh,

1121
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:55,180
on the top floor. Boom. So if you
need me know where to come find me,

1122
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,810
something happens. Hey, where's
this platoon leader going to be yet?

1123
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:59,380
Once we get our targets here,
I'm going to come over here.

1124
01:07:59,381 --> 01:08:01,360
I missed out on the backside with
a breach took place if you need me,

1125
01:08:01,361 --> 01:08:02,700
that's where I'll be.
So everyone got it.

1126
01:08:02,701 --> 01:08:06,970
So you know where everyone is and is he
talking about like having a a standard

1127
01:08:06,971 --> 01:08:10,160
that's like a, like a symbol. It's
a flag. Yeah, the actual flag.

1128
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:12,090
An actual flag he's wearing.

1129
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:16,010
Matt wouldn't really know we didn't
do that because isn't there like

1130
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:19,790
a thing? Yes. That's saying like, Hey,
you don't want it. Like, what was it?

1131
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:23,420
I want to say saving private Ryan. He's
like, don't salute. Yeah, year, whatever.

1132
01:08:23,421 --> 01:08:26,870
Cause I don't want the enemy to see where.
Yup. Yeah. You definitely don't want

1133
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:32,300
to mark your position when
these guys are general.

1134
01:08:33,010 --> 01:08:37,010
And as a matter of fact, and I'm trying
to think of what book we recently did,

1135
01:08:37,011 --> 01:08:40,250
where he was talking about like,
yeah, if you're seeing running around,

1136
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:43,610
if you're a radio man or you're seen
running around giving direction,

1137
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,930
you're going to get shot. Yeah. Yeah.
The officer that was, he was Vietnam,

1138
01:08:47,931 --> 01:08:51,530
I think it was a, I think it was
the battle I drank. But yeah,

1139
01:08:51,531 --> 01:08:54,860
they're talking about that. Oh yeah. It
definitely was a battle of wide drank.

1140
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,930
It was, cause when they were
leaving they said like within,

1141
01:08:57,020 --> 01:09:00,980
within minutes the leaders had been
killed in a radio man had been killed.

1142
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:04,160
The ones that were still
with their elements. So yeah,

1143
01:09:04,161 --> 01:09:05,510
that's not something you want to do.

1144
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:09,320
But what we would do is brief where we
are going to be so that everyone on the

1145
01:09:09,321 --> 01:09:14,030
team knew based on a terrain
feature. Yeah. You know, hey,

1146
01:09:14,031 --> 01:09:17,570
here's this. Here's this building, or
here's this knoll of this mountain,

1147
01:09:17,571 --> 01:09:20,930
or here's this intersection's road.
That's where I'll be. That's where I'm,

1148
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:24,320
that's what I'm planning to be. So now
people know where you are. It makes sense.

1149
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:29,540
I mean he had an additional thing
there when when he said, um, so that,

1150
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:31,670
you know, the general
watching kind of thing. Yeah.

1151
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:36,710
I guess that wouldn't really apply to
your situation. No, it wouldn't apply.

1152
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:42,040
Although like in the military when the
general is visiting and as a two star

1153
01:09:42,801 --> 01:09:47,670
general, they've raised a two
star flag. Everyone knows it so,

1154
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:49,190
okay. So I guess, yeah, you're right.

1155
01:09:49,191 --> 01:09:53,900
So it will be real circumstantial
like during the war combat situation.

1156
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,273
Gotcha.

1157
01:09:56,780 --> 01:10:00,770
Now he talks about the companies
and again he calls them centuries,

1158
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,190
which is basically a company sized
element of around a hundred guys.

1159
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:09,500
And he's saying that they should have
their own little symbols as well and their

1160
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:11,570
own standards back to the book.

1161
01:10:11,571 --> 01:10:13,790
If the standards are distinguished
by their different colors,

1162
01:10:13,791 --> 01:10:16,790
the actions of every
century will be conspicuous.

1163
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:21,200
This will create the greatest emulation
because both officers and soldiers will

1164
01:10:21,201 --> 01:10:24,230
know that they are seen
and that their countenance,

1165
01:10:24,231 --> 01:10:27,500
conduct and behavior are not
ignored by the rest of the army.

1166
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:32,600
The men as well as the officers will
tell of it in the field and in garrison

1167
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:36,860
there exploits will be constant.
The constant subject of conversation.

1168
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:41,420
I thought that was kind of a
cool idea. You know, if you're,

1169
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:46,450
if you're flying the flag then people
are watching you and so you better act.

1170
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:48,950
You'd better come correct or represents.
Yeah.

1171
01:10:48,951 --> 01:10:53,140
You better represent actually I
like come crack does come correct.

1172
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:59,570
Back to the book after the
Organization of military troops,

1173
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,260
military discipline is the first
matter that presents itself.

1174
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:06,530
It is the soul of armies

1175
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:09,860
that is such a nice ring to it

1176
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:14,070
is the soul of the as well,

1177
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:17,850
but I suppose we'll talk about that later.
Back to the book.

1178
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:22,910
If it is not established with wisdom and
maintained with unshakable resolution,

1179
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:28,430
you'll have no soldiers regiments and
armies will be only contemptible armed

1180
01:11:28,711 --> 01:11:31,950
mobs more dangerous to their
own country than the enemy.

1181
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:35,440
It is a false idea that discipline,

1182
01:11:35,441 --> 01:11:40,050
subordination and slavish obedience,
debase courage.

1183
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:44,970
It has always been noted that it is
with those armies in which the severest

1184
01:11:44,971 --> 01:11:49,050
discipline is enforced,
that the greatest deeds are performed.

1185
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:54,480
Many generals believe that they have done
everything as soon as they have issued

1186
01:11:54,481 --> 01:11:59,370
orders and that they are and they order
a great deal because they find many

1187
01:11:59,371 --> 01:12:00,000
abuses.

1188
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,360
So he's saying they're like when a general
feels like he's talking about a bad

1189
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:06,120
general,
what a general feels like.

1190
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:08,790
They've done everything as soon as
they've given their order and since that's

1191
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:09,331
what they do,

1192
01:12:09,331 --> 01:12:12,090
they give all kinds of orders or ordered
you to do this and I'm already to do

1193
01:12:12,091 --> 01:12:14,340
that. I'm going to order you use
something else. Here's what he says.

1194
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:19,440
This is a false principle
proceeding in this fashion.

1195
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:24,330
They will never reestablished discipline
in an army in which it has been lost or

1196
01:12:24,331 --> 01:12:28,320
weekend.
Few orders are best,

1197
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:32,850
but they should be followed up with care.

1198
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:38,210
Negligence should be punished without
partiality and without distinction of rank

1199
01:12:39,331 --> 01:12:42,330
or birth.
Otherwise you will make yourself hated.

1200
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:48,470
One can be exact and just and beloved
at the same time as feared severity must

1201
01:12:51,211 --> 01:12:52,980
be accompanied with kindness.

1202
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:57,870
But this should not have the
appearance of pretense but of goodness.

1203
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,570
And this is just a little note,

1204
01:13:00,571 --> 01:13:03,480
I thought everyone should know
whippings need not be severe.

1205
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:08,940
The more moderate they are,
the more quickly we'll abuses be remedied.

1206
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:12,270
Since all the world will
join in ending them.

1207
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:16,050
So even when you're whipping your people,
you know,

1208
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,690
be a little bit more judicious.

1209
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:24,470
We have, uh, this is, this
is good too. We have a,

1210
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:29,480
a pernicious custom in France
have always punishing with death.

1211
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:33,690
I'll soldier caught
pillaging is hung the result.

1212
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,670
Now what do you think the result of
that would be? That he's going to say,

1213
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:41,060
I'm quizzing you. What's your
guess if you, if you, um,

1214
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:44,520
are pillaging called pillaging, you're
going to get home. What do you think the,

1215
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:48,740
what do you think that happens because of
that happens to who? What do you think?

1216
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:51,680
Why should we not hang
people for pillaging?

1217
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:54,780
Do you think there's a lot of pillage and
going on? If you get caught pillaging,

1218
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:59,780
they hang you or your fellow soldiers. Do
you think they pillage? I say, no. Okay,

1219
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:00,713
you're wrong.

1220
01:14:00,990 --> 01:14:05,990
The result is that no one arrests him
because they do not want to cause the

1221
01:14:06,301 --> 01:14:11,301
death of a poor devil who is only trying
to live if instead we were only turned

1222
01:14:11,441 --> 01:14:14,620
him over to the guard to
be putting chains, contend
to bread and water for one,

1223
01:14:14,621 --> 01:14:17,340
two or three months or put to work in,

1224
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:21,490
in at any of the labors that
always have to be done in any army,

1225
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:24,820
and then they were sent to his regiment
before a battle or when the general

1226
01:14:24,821 --> 01:14:28,450
wished everyone would agree with this
punishment and the officers of the patrols

1227
01:14:28,451 --> 01:14:30,040
would arrest them by the hundreds.

1228
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:33,730
Soon there will be no pillaging because
everyone would join in putting it under

1229
01:14:33,731 --> 01:14:38,110
control. So it makes sense. That
is the reason I asked you that,

1230
01:14:38,111 --> 01:14:41,560
which I don't normally do is because I
thought the same thing. I was like, well,

1231
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:43,390
what's, where's he going with
this? Oh yeah. It's obvious.

1232
01:14:43,391 --> 01:14:44,224
Why don't you think about it?

1233
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:47,380
You're not going to report one of your
guys for stealing something if the

1234
01:14:47,381 --> 01:14:50,200
punishment was death. Right.
You know what that is?

1235
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:53,480
That's like that's like small picture
versus big picture. Small picture.

1236
01:14:53,550 --> 01:14:56,850
The small picture is like yeah cause
cause you just look at it as yourself,

1237
01:14:56,860 --> 01:15:00,010
right? You get your bubble in your head.
You're like I wouldn't pillage if it,

1238
01:15:00,011 --> 01:15:03,460
if it, if it was death, I wouldn't pillage
and that's how you're looking at it.

1239
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:08,290
But no big picture is like hey apply
that to everyone applied to the whole

1240
01:15:08,291 --> 01:15:10,960
community. Exactly right. If
you tell him this guy pillaging,

1241
01:15:10,961 --> 01:15:13,660
you just sentenced him to death.
If you tell on him,

1242
01:15:13,661 --> 01:15:16,260
maybe you turn them in and whatever.
That's what you did. Good point. And it's,

1243
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:19,690
I just remembered somebody pointed out
to me, you remember rifleman Harrison.

1244
01:15:19,691 --> 01:15:24,130
It starts off when my rifle and Harris
has to execute a guy and I said,

1245
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:27,490
I said on the podcast,
Hey,

1246
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:31,720
this guy's getting executed basically
for desertion and being drunk.

1247
01:15:32,290 --> 01:15:37,290
What I didn't realize is if somebody sent
me an email or a social media message,

1248
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:39,071
they said,
hey,

1249
01:15:39,071 --> 01:15:43,480
the reason that guy was getting executed
was because he had taken the money for

1250
01:15:43,481 --> 01:15:46,600
like 16 enlistments and kept disappearing.

1251
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:49,680
So when you do get a signing
bonus, hey, here's here's,

1252
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:51,910
it was probably nothing but you know,
here's,

1253
01:15:52,030 --> 01:15:55,540
here's 10 quid or pound
sterling or whatever,

1254
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:58,330
here's 10 pounds sterling, oh
you're joining the army, cool,

1255
01:15:58,331 --> 01:16:00,190
here's 10 and then you take that money,

1256
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:03,370
go get drunk and get crazy and then you
do it again and then you do it again in

1257
01:16:03,371 --> 01:16:04,570
a different area because
they have no internet.

1258
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:07,240
They have no way of knowing that this
is the guy when they finally catch him,

1259
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:08,470
he's getting sentenced to death.

1260
01:16:08,471 --> 01:16:12,160
Now do I think as you get sentenced
to death either for that? Not really,

1261
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:16,060
but he was doing something more severe
than what I had mentioned on the podcast.

1262
01:16:16,061 --> 01:16:19,450
So I just wanted to, while I'm thinking
about that, set the record straight,

1263
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:24,310
but the, the main point here for me,
it's the secondary effects, right?

1264
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:27,730
You think you're going to have? The
primary effect is, Oh, if we do this,

1265
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:30,340
no one's going to, if we're going to
kill you, if you get caught pillaging,

1266
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:33,250
no one's gonna, no one's
gonna pillage anymore. No,

1267
01:16:33,251 --> 01:16:36,460
actually no one's gonna report it anymore
cause your punishment is too strong.

1268
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:42,610
This is also how, this is also how
and why. When people think that,

1269
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:45,850
oh, if someone's in the military, the
soldiers just do what they're told wrong.

1270
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:49,390
The soldiers actually there,
there's secondary effects. Oh,

1271
01:16:49,391 --> 01:16:51,970
you're going to kill the guys. No,
we're not going to report it then. Yeah,

1272
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,560
so there's,
there are secondary effects.

1273
01:16:53,561 --> 01:16:54,940
Even though they'd been
ordered to do that,

1274
01:16:54,941 --> 01:16:56,680
and they're soldiers and they have
disciplined, they've been training,

1275
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:58,540
he's bragging about discipline
all the time. Guess what?

1276
01:16:58,541 --> 01:17:00,430
They don't Paul that order
because the order sucks.

1277
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:02,620
That's what we got to remember.
Not just about the military,

1278
01:17:02,621 --> 01:17:03,610
but about business too.

1279
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:07,150
You give people dumb orders or you give
people things that don't make sense,

1280
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:09,410
they're not really going to execute
it the way you'd want them to,

1281
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,470
and I'll tell you something else.
You don't want them to execute that way.

1282
01:17:12,471 --> 01:17:15,170
Cause if they got hundreds of people
pillaging and you now end up murdering

1283
01:17:15,171 --> 01:17:17,240
hundreds of own your own people,
you're affecting your own army,

1284
01:17:17,241 --> 01:17:20,120
you're going to get deserters
were working in army like that.

1285
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:23,510
It's the same thing with a business.
You start laying out severe punishment,

1286
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:25,640
punishment that doesn't make sense,

1287
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:29,390
isn't reciprocal to the crime that
was committed. I mean you pillage.

1288
01:17:29,391 --> 01:17:32,780
Think about what pillaging is. I
took some bread from the store. Cool.

1289
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:37,670
We're going to shoot you the head. Dang.
The punishment did not fit the crime.

1290
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:42,300
Yeah, in that case. All right.

1291
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,620
[inaudible] he's talking
about where to build,

1292
01:17:45,621 --> 01:17:48,590
where to build tactical
positions and he says,

1293
01:17:48,591 --> 01:17:50,870
and this is just the same thing
you said earlier about people,

1294
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:54,230
but he's talking about
basically talking about terrain.

1295
01:17:54,231 --> 01:17:58,400
Now nature is infinitely stronger than
the works of man. Why not profit from it?

1296
01:17:58,430 --> 01:18:00,470
Meaning use a river,
use a hill,

1297
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:05,210
use use terrain to build
your defensive positions.

1298
01:18:05,211 --> 01:18:07,070
Don't just use a shovel.

1299
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:13,490
Same thing that he talked about
earlier with with human beings.

1300
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:18,530
Now another piece,

1301
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:24,460
many persons believe that is advantageous
to take the field early and this is

1302
01:18:24,471 --> 01:18:28,010
coming right back. Sun Tzu art
of war, be there first. Yeah,

1303
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:32,150
Saks maybe doesn't agree with that
a little bit. Here they are. Right.

1304
01:18:32,151 --> 01:18:35,090
What does the question of seizing
an important post? Otherwise,

1305
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:40,210
it seems to me that there is no need to
hastened and that one should remain in

1306
01:18:40,431 --> 01:18:44,660
winter quarters longer than usual.
So he goes on to talk.

1307
01:18:44,661 --> 01:18:47,600
Winter quarters means you're, you're
gonna go out in the field. Well,

1308
01:18:47,601 --> 01:18:49,880
we're gonna go out in the field
now and we're going to be cold,

1309
01:18:49,881 --> 01:18:52,850
wet and miserable for the next three days
while we wait for the enemy to show up.

1310
01:18:52,851 --> 01:18:55,830
And now they show up fresh. Who's
going to do better in the battle? Yeah.

1311
01:18:56,420 --> 01:19:00,610
So just to think about,
I used to say the,

1312
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:03,620
the military used to say all the time, you
know, you've got to be forward leaning.

1313
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:06,200
You ever heard that
expression? [inaudible] yeah.
Got To be forward leaning.

1314
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:08,060
And I would say,

1315
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:11,660
let's not be so forward leaning that were
in the leaning rest of leaning rest is

1316
01:19:11,661 --> 01:19:15,260
the pushup position. Which they would
leave you in for a long periods of time.

1317
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:18,530
A lot of different training situations.

1318
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:21,190
So sometimes you get so proactive
gets so leaning forward,

1319
01:19:21,191 --> 01:19:24,050
a forward leaning that you're in
leaning rest and you're wasting energy.

1320
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:25,820
Just trying to be all prepared.

1321
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:31,270
Like you'd see some guys warm up. You do
such a good warm up that you're tired.

1322
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:32,100
Yeah.

1323
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:35,300
You went so far forward leaning in the
leaning rest and then the other thing is

1324
01:19:35,301 --> 01:19:38,120
to not warm up at all. Now you're not
ready, so you've got to find what you got.

1325
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:40,400
That's the dichotomy of leadership. You
got to find a balance between those two.

1326
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:41,633
Yeah.

1327
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:45,650
Another good point here.
Back to the book,

1328
01:19:45,651 --> 01:19:48,890
it is absolutely necessary to
accustom soldiers to labor.

1329
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:51,650
If we examine Roman history,

1330
01:19:51,651 --> 01:19:56,651
we find we shall find that republic
looked on ease and indolence as the most

1331
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:01,370
formidable enemies.

1332
01:20:02,850 --> 01:20:03,310
Yeah.

1333
01:20:03,310 --> 01:20:08,310
The console's prepared their legions for
battle by rendering them indefatigable

1334
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:12,780
rather than have them idle,

1335
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:16,350
they employed them on unnecessary works.

1336
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:21,300
Continual exercise makes good soldiers
because it qualifies them for military

1337
01:20:21,301 --> 01:20:24,450
duties.
By being habituated to pain,

1338
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,900
they insensibly learn to despise danger.

1339
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:32,280
The transition from fatigue to rest.

1340
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:35,430
Enervates them meaning weakens them.

1341
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:39,660
They compare one state
with another and idleness.

1342
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:44,280
That predominant passion of
mankind gains ascendancy over them.

1343
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:50,120
They then murmur at every trifling
inconvenience and their souls soften and

1344
01:20:50,581 --> 01:20:55,230
they're emasculated bodies.
Yeah.

1345
01:20:55,231 --> 01:20:59,640
So what he's saying is people get used
to the soft ways people get used to the

1346
01:20:59,641 --> 01:21:03,810
easy life. And if you let them
get used to it like you, you,

1347
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:06,510
when you want to do something hard,
when it's time to do something hard,

1348
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:07,820
you're not ready for it.
Yeah.

1349
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:12,120
Every minute that Charlie's out in
the bush getting stronger, every time,

1350
01:21:12,121 --> 01:21:15,180
almost every day at night I'm spending
in this hotel, it's apocalypse now.

1351
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:17,040
Every night I'm sitting in
this hotel getting softer.

1352
01:21:17,041 --> 01:21:19,620
Every night Charlie's out in
the bush getting stronger.

1353
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:24,390
That's what he's talking about here.
That's what he's talking about.

1354
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:29,430
But now do I agree with having
people do unnecessary works? No,

1355
01:21:29,431 --> 01:21:31,830
I don't. Because people see
right through that and it just,

1356
01:21:31,831 --> 01:21:35,400
you're just being stupid and taking are
going to see that. They're gonna say,

1357
01:21:35,401 --> 01:21:38,700
why are we doing this? Dig
The hole, Phillip. Back up,
dig the hole, fill it back up.

1358
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:40,950
No, don't do that. But you know,
we're going to a training exercise.

1359
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:43,950
When you're training exercise, we're
going to get stronger. We're going to get,

1360
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:47,640
we're going to dig a hole, we're going to
put, you know, set it up for a perimeter.

1361
01:21:47,790 --> 01:21:52,690
Then we're going to move to another
situation is if we have to back away or,

1362
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:55,080
or collapse our perimeter.
Cause when you collapse a perimeter,

1363
01:21:55,081 --> 01:21:56,220
you've got to fill that whole back end.

1364
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:58,170
Otherwise when the enemy comes
to attack you, they use it.

1365
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:03,000
So you got to fill that whole back end.
So let's run a real drill. And by the way,

1366
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:05,370
let's make it into a little contest
and see how fast we can dig in.

1367
01:22:05,371 --> 01:22:06,420
And then once we get it dug in,

1368
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:08,790
we're going to set up when see how fast
we can collapse and get it filled back

1369
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:10,470
in.
We're doing it at the end of it,

1370
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,400
we're going to give out some
prizes and have a beer. Right?

1371
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:19,480
That's a good tactic by the way. I like
to make a, um, whether it be a game or,

1372
01:22:21,070 --> 01:22:21,360
yeah,

1373
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:26,360
you told her is Charles gamified Chelsea
us the game of hockey game of vacation.

1374
01:22:27,390 --> 01:22:29,350
Like if you're moving,
you know,

1375
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,700
you don't when you're moving your house
or whatever and how fast can I get this

1376
01:22:32,701 --> 01:22:35,610
stuff packed up or let me use it
as a little workout, little metcon.

1377
01:22:36,010 --> 01:22:39,660
We got to move all of these boxes
upstairs, two floors, whatever.

1378
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:43,670
Let me use it as a workout. It kind
of makes it more enjoyable as well.

1379
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:47,460
But at the same time you get the results
of a, of a little workout right there.

1380
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:50,550
Here, let me ask you this about that.
When you said you didn't agree with the,

1381
01:22:50,551 --> 01:22:53,430
the unnecessary, unnecessary
works, this is, what about um,

1382
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:58,140
like pushups as punishment for example,
or a Kettler exercise? An interesting one.

1383
01:22:58,141 --> 01:23:01,260
Cause, cause I think,
I think like with kids,

1384
01:23:01,261 --> 01:23:06,220
if you make burpees a punishment, they
don't like it. Or if you make it a reward,

1385
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:08,800
they liked them, then you're
better off clear it. Yeah, I agree.

1386
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:11,470
I do that by the way. Yeah, that's
good. You make it a reward. Yeah,

1387
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:14,780
like a we'll need the cool people
do burpees. That's what it is.

1388
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,740
They see dead doing burpees,
Dead Dune,

1389
01:23:16,790 --> 01:23:19,580
the end of these whatever exercises
or whatever. Only cool people do it.

1390
01:23:20,970 --> 01:23:24,700
I kind of pushed hard on that
too, but it's unfair. But
no. The question is though,

1391
01:23:25,210 --> 01:23:28,420
in the military, in
the military, not kids,

1392
01:23:28,990 --> 01:23:31,990
no calisthenics or definitely punishment
in the military. Yeah, straight up.

1393
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:36,160
It's not until you transitioned out of
the boot camps that you get away from

1394
01:23:36,161 --> 01:23:39,400
that now in the seal teams,
like they don't,

1395
01:23:39,670 --> 01:23:43,450
you don't do calisthenics as punishment.

1396
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:48,070
I will say that if you mess up,

1397
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:50,350
like for instance when
I was running training,

1398
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:54,400
if the guys performed poorly,

1399
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:57,670
they were going to have more down
men getting, this is a training,

1400
01:23:57,671 --> 01:23:59,110
I'm talking about fake down men,

1401
01:23:59,111 --> 01:24:01,270
but they're going to have
more men that couldn't walk.

1402
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:05,740
That's more men that have to be carried.
That's punishment in its own right.

1403
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:08,260
That's a punishment.
If you,

1404
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:14,020
when I was running communications course
when I was a younger enlisted seal,

1405
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:18,820
if you missed a communications window,
you had to walk a longer distance.

1406
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:24,140
If you missed multiple, you're going
to have to walk tragic distances. Now.

1407
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:28,980
It wasn't just a natural
result of you missing missing.
Did you impose that? Fine.

1408
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:33,590
Just imposed yesterday was
imposed and they knew it was
imposed. Okay. And and so,

1409
01:24:33,591 --> 01:24:38,320
yeah, you, if you miss in the seal teams,

1410
01:24:38,321 --> 01:24:42,340
if you miss the extraction point with
a boat's coming to pick you up after a

1411
01:24:42,341 --> 01:24:46,270
dive, well now you got to swim to the new
exotic, new, the pickup point. Guess what?

1412
01:24:46,271 --> 01:24:49,870
The new pickup point isn't close
because you've compromised.

1413
01:24:49,871 --> 01:24:51,910
Now you're above the surface.
Do you need to get away?

1414
01:24:52,590 --> 01:24:54,760
And so that means you got
to swim an extra, you know,

1415
01:24:54,761 --> 01:24:59,120
maybe it's an extra hour of
surface swimming with a rig
on it, which is not fun.

1416
01:24:59,290 --> 01:25:02,260
But it doesn't sound fun cause you
can't, you're, you're not just,

1417
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:05,440
you're not just having fun.
Right. It's called turtle back.

1418
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:09,440
You're laying on your back cause
it's really awkward. It's, it's,

1419
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:12,550
it's comfortable to
dive with our dive rig.

1420
01:25:12,551 --> 01:25:14,530
We have a dive rig that's,

1421
01:25:14,590 --> 01:25:18,550
it's called a rebreather and it goes
on your chest and it's small. It's not,

1422
01:25:18,551 --> 01:25:21,310
it's not tiny. Closed circuit.
It's closed circuit. Yeah,

1423
01:25:21,311 --> 01:25:25,600
look at you look at you big time.
So it's a closed circuit dive rig,

1424
01:25:25,601 --> 01:25:27,850
but when it runs out you can't,

1425
01:25:27,851 --> 01:25:32,851
it doesn't work anymore so you have to
swim and we do something called turtle

1426
01:25:33,411 --> 01:25:34,270
back generally,

1427
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:37,420
which is basically you're laying on
your back and you're just fending and it

1428
01:25:37,421 --> 01:25:40,540
takes a long time to move very
far and it's not comfortable.

1429
01:25:40,690 --> 01:25:45,430
So the punishment is in training. If you
miss your extraction point, that's fine.

1430
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:48,610
You just got to swim to the
alternate extraction point.

1431
01:25:48,611 --> 01:25:52,480
The alternate extraction point is not
going to be close by because you screwed

1432
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:53,230
up.

1433
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:57,850
Same thing with if you miss
your helicopter extraction
because you took too long

1434
01:25:57,851 --> 01:26:00,430
on target and then you got bogged down
and it took you a long time to move all

1435
01:26:00,431 --> 01:26:04,040
these down people. That's, I
mean it happens. Understand that,

1436
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:08,540
but now you have to walk to
the secondary extraction point,

1437
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:13,370
which happens to be six kilometers
up a hill. Yeah, see, but that's,

1438
01:26:14,130 --> 01:26:17,210
to me, and this is me pinking
whatever, 10 seconds about it.

1439
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:20,480
That seems like that makes perfect sense.
In fact,

1440
01:26:20,481 --> 01:26:23,600
that seems like a cool little strategy
because in real life that's how it works.

1441
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:27,050
You use the bus, you ride the
bus to school, you miss the bus,

1442
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:29,690
you're walking to school or
riding your bike, whatever.

1443
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:31,340
It's kind of that thing that's,

1444
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:35,120
that's how life deals it to you a lot
of the time. Like these types of things,

1445
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:38,600
what you're saying. But
let's say, hey you, you know,

1446
01:26:38,601 --> 01:26:41,720
your shoes aren't shined or
whatever. I Dunno, aren't shying,

1447
01:26:41,721 --> 01:26:45,620
give me 50 push ups or they
don't do it in the seal teams.

1448
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:47,510
They definitely do it in the army.

1449
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:50,990
They definitely do it in the Rangers
Rangers that they're dropping down all the

1450
01:26:50,991 --> 01:26:55,660
time and, but no, we don't do that. And
so that's the question though. Do you,

1451
01:26:55,661 --> 01:26:59,300
do you agree with that or do you
even think about that kind of stuff?

1452
01:26:59,330 --> 01:27:02,870
I don't think about that kind of stuff.
Yeah. I think being, I would say that I,

1453
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:08,260
that I would not do it when I was in a
military leadership position just because

1454
01:27:11,870 --> 01:27:14,270
I would rather, I dunno. Yeah, it's weird.

1455
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:18,500
It feels like it just makes sense when
I know that the army runs it that way.

1456
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,350
It makes sense. And by the way,
when the army does it, and I,

1457
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:23,960
I shouldn't even say anything else about
the way the army does it cause I'm not,

1458
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:27,890
I don't know exactly how
they implement that strategy.

1459
01:27:27,891 --> 01:27:29,660
So next time we have Tim Kennedy on,

1460
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:33,440
we'll get them to give us a full debrief
on that and we'll get another, another,

1461
01:27:33,441 --> 01:27:36,500
a range around here to give us a full
debrief on that. Here's something,

1462
01:27:37,030 --> 01:27:38,630
so I was watching the show,

1463
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,810
ran this random show me my
wife before we were married,

1464
01:27:41,811 --> 01:27:43,670
when we were just dating whatever.

1465
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:48,140
We'd watch these random shows and it
was a kind of like a reality show,

1466
01:27:48,141 --> 01:27:51,650
kind of like a competition show. But
it was, I think army, like you know,

1467
01:27:51,651 --> 01:27:53,840
you grab regular people,
put them in army scenario,

1468
01:27:53,841 --> 01:27:56,960
you give them like missions and it's like,
cause they have a ranger,

1469
01:27:56,990 --> 01:27:59,750
they have a best ranger every year.
They have a best ranger competition,

1470
01:27:59,751 --> 01:28:04,170
which are really hardcore competition.
Well, it was, it was, you know,

1471
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:08,360
it's a lot like the FTX a lot like
that, but it's a whole like, you know,

1472
01:28:08,490 --> 01:28:12,620
you're there for like a month or whatever
and same but a lot of drill sergeant

1473
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:15,680
type situations dropping,
give me 2050 whatever. Right.

1474
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:19,850
So it was towards the end of the season
or whatever and this girl was like,

1475
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:24,470
she was like, Dang, look how strong
and like muscular my arms are now.

1476
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,870
This is just from all the push ups
we had to do and stuff like that.

1477
01:28:26,871 --> 01:28:29,510
Just by happenstance. Sure.
She was getting punished. Sure.

1478
01:28:29,511 --> 01:28:33,650
She was learning to you follow directions
more meticulously and all this stuff

1479
01:28:33,651 --> 01:28:35,840
that you learned from, you
know, the whole, you know,

1480
01:28:35,841 --> 01:28:40,640
orders versus punishment situation,
but as kind of a byproduct if you will,

1481
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:44,750
she has some physical strength. No. You
know, wonder if that has something to do.

1482
01:28:45,230 --> 01:28:48,230
Maybe you're definitely,
you're definitely making people stronger.

1483
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:51,800
There's no doubt about it. Yeah. So
that's all positive for sure. Yeah.

1484
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:55,280
There's no doubt the
great bright biproduct of,

1485
01:28:55,370 --> 01:28:59,360
of calisthenics as punishment
is you get stronger.

1486
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:02,100
But like

1487
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:06,870
in the, in the seals it's weird. It's
weird. It's not a thing. It's not a thing.

1488
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:10,380
Okay, you're going to drop down and
give me 50 like that deliberately.

1489
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:12,990
I never saw that happen.
A single,

1490
01:29:14,730 --> 01:29:17,640
it might've happened with new
guys sometimes like occasion,

1491
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:20,160
like a new guy that you're not getting
through to him. Okay. Guess what?

1492
01:29:20,830 --> 01:29:23,160
But even with new guys, if you really
want to get through to who got what,

1493
01:29:23,161 --> 01:29:25,830
you want them to be good at his tactics,
not push up to people in teams.

1494
01:29:25,831 --> 01:29:28,390
You're supposed to do pushups on your own.
Man was like,

1495
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:31,920
we're not in here to teach you how
to do pushups. Like you need to,

1496
01:29:32,730 --> 01:29:33,960
you need to be in shape.

1497
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:38,350
But we want to make better things to
do what I was going to say. But here,

1498
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:42,660
but at the same time you can't help
but wonder. Maybe that's just like,

1499
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:45,480
that's a certain way of looking at
it, which is good. Seems obvious.

1500
01:29:45,481 --> 01:29:49,320
Seems effective to me. But what if
there's something like that, you know,

1501
01:29:49,321 --> 01:29:51,000
like something from back in the day,

1502
01:29:51,001 --> 01:29:55,500
some old school fundamental principle
that that's kind of why you do it.

1503
01:29:55,530 --> 01:29:56,520
That's super innovative.

1504
01:29:56,521 --> 01:30:01,270
Maybe that's why in the teams they don't
do it because they want you to be self

1505
01:30:01,271 --> 01:30:04,680
disciplined. Not like
specific, yeah. Not, not self.

1506
01:30:04,681 --> 01:30:07,250
Not disciplined by the group but in post.
But yeah,

1507
01:30:07,251 --> 01:30:08,370
you don't want to impose discipline

1508
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:13,140
interest so well regardless,

1509
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:18,200
I think that you should train hard because
you don't want to have your soul gets

1510
01:30:19,711 --> 01:30:22,170
softened inside of your
emasculated Bhakti.

1511
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:26,340
That just sounds like something,
I don't want to be a part of that,

1512
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:29,850
so I'll keep training
back to the book.

1513
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:32,730
There is more skill in one might think.

1514
01:30:33,570 --> 01:30:37,500
Then my then one might think and
making poor dispositions intentionally,

1515
01:30:37,710 --> 01:30:41,340
but one must be able to change
them into good ones in an instant.

1516
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:46,550
So he's talking about how you set yourself
up in a bad position only to let the

1517
01:30:47,371 --> 01:30:49,170
enemy try and maneuver on that.

1518
01:30:49,171 --> 01:30:50,820
Put your waiting for me when
you're ready and do something.

1519
01:30:50,910 --> 01:30:55,230
You change your position and do something
good like in Jujitsu when you're

1520
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:56,550
getting let someone set up a triangle,

1521
01:30:56,551 --> 01:30:58,190
but you're just trying to pass
their guard. Gotcha. Yeah.

1522
01:30:59,130 --> 01:31:01,440
Nothing is more
disconcerting to the enemy.

1523
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,230
He has counted on a certain thing,

1524
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:09,500
has disposed himself accordingly and at
the instant of attacking it has changed.

1525
01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:15,720
So, so this is, this
is pretty cool, right?

1526
01:31:15,721 --> 01:31:18,750
This is a good thing to remember.

1527
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:22,620
I like when you talk about
us is psychological effect
that it has on the enemy.

1528
01:31:22,621 --> 01:31:27,060
So the enemy sees something,
they expect something,

1529
01:31:27,330 --> 01:31:31,050
they want something to go a certain way.
So they arrange themselves for it.

1530
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:33,590
And then right when they're
getting ready to execute it,

1531
01:31:33,591 --> 01:31:35,160
they realize it wasn't what they thought.
And he says,

1532
01:31:35,161 --> 01:31:36,510
there's nothing more disconcerting.

1533
01:31:36,511 --> 01:31:41,511
And I'd say that's true with a person to
the unexpected is what disturbs people.

1534
01:31:41,911 --> 01:31:45,720
Especially you see this all the time
in MMA where a guy gets close to a

1535
01:31:45,721 --> 01:31:49,400
submission and then he'd get, the other
guy gets out and he expanded on gender,

1536
01:31:49,401 --> 01:31:51,330
genders. You can see the,
you can see the, the,

1537
01:31:51,630 --> 01:31:55,850
the moral draining from
their face when it present.

1538
01:31:56,270 --> 01:31:59,590
It's bad sometimes. Dude, sometimes

1539
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:03,700
he go, he goes on, I repeat.

1540
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:08,880
Nothing confuses him so greatly and
leads him into more serious faults.

1541
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:14,920
If he does not change his disposition,
he will be defeated.

1542
01:32:15,130 --> 01:32:20,080
And if he changes them in the presence
of the enemy, he will still be defeated.

1543
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:23,800
Human Spirit cannot meet it.

1544
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:30,640
I'm trying to think of how that affects
someone's psych. Oh yeah. It affects,

1545
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:33,070
it definitely affects you psychologically.
Like you throw the,

1546
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:35,080
you think it would get this person,
that triangle,

1547
01:32:35,081 --> 01:32:36,730
you put it on there and
then all of a sudden, boom.

1548
01:32:36,731 --> 01:32:38,890
You realize it's not just
that you missed the triangle,

1549
01:32:38,891 --> 01:32:40,180
it's so you realize that you got played

1550
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:45,840
and that doesn't feel good and that
can definitely hurt your morale. Yeah.

1551
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:46,733
Big Time.

1552
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:52,210
That's a little different than just
missing the move when you realize you got

1553
01:32:52,211 --> 01:32:53,044
set up actually,

1554
01:32:53,090 --> 01:32:57,230
that it messes up your whole
game. So, okay, so you wrote
with stilts, right? Yeah.

1555
01:32:57,430 --> 01:33:00,250
Okay. So that's, that's a, I don't
want to say that's his whole game,

1556
01:33:00,251 --> 01:33:04,360
but that's his game right there.
So like if you go, you know,

1557
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:08,920
side control or mount or whatever, he has
dangerous, we wants to there one. Yes,

1558
01:33:08,921 --> 01:33:10,630
exactly right.
So it's like,

1559
01:33:11,410 --> 01:33:13,840
and every once in a while you get
rolling with them like kind of hard.

1560
01:33:13,870 --> 01:33:15,640
It'll seem like he's
trying to defend them out,

1561
01:33:15,641 --> 01:33:19,020
but he's really letting you think that
you got the mountain right. You know,

1562
01:33:19,030 --> 01:33:21,130
cause even if you're like,
if is letting you mount,

1563
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:23,980
you know they're letting you mouth and
if they're going to spring some sort of a

1564
01:33:23,981 --> 01:33:26,320
trap, it's going to be more obvious
if they're letting you do it.

1565
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:30,070
But you get them where he kind of lets
you do it to the point where you don't

1566
01:33:30,071 --> 01:33:32,410
realize he's, yeah, you just got,

1567
01:33:32,411 --> 01:33:35,370
and then from there after a while
he keeps doing stuff like that too.

1568
01:33:35,390 --> 01:33:35,891
You're like,
Bro,

1569
01:33:35,891 --> 01:33:38,670
I don't even really want to do anything
to him because he's just going to send

1570
01:33:38,671 --> 01:33:41,770
me, this is just a bunch of traps right
now. So it messes up your whole game.

1571
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:44,680
You can't do anything on
your own accord though.

1572
01:33:44,681 --> 01:33:46,690
It's not like he's preventing
you from doing anything.

1573
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:50,080
It's like you're preventing
yourself now that's a,

1574
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:51,910
that's a situation he has to deal with.

1575
01:33:54,430 --> 01:33:57,250
But actually actually I figured it out.
I figured out,

1576
01:33:58,990 --> 01:33:59,860
I didn't figure it out.

1577
01:33:59,861 --> 01:34:03,430
I figured out a method to deal with
just that whole scenario with him,

1578
01:34:03,431 --> 01:34:07,610
by the way. And he even asked me
afterwards, so I was like, oh, let's,

1579
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:11,260
I was going hard. And I was, you know
how you get real like weary like okay,

1580
01:34:11,261 --> 01:34:14,470
I know he's gonna send me. So it was
real uneventful role. So I was like, Hey,

1581
01:34:14,471 --> 01:34:15,400
let's go roll again.

1582
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:20,290
And then I just loosened up and basically
allowed him to spring whatever trap he

1583
01:34:20,291 --> 01:34:22,840
wants, I need. Danny did all
this stuff and he was like, Hey,

1584
01:34:22,841 --> 01:34:25,450
you were rolling a lot lighter
in that time. I was like, no bro,

1585
01:34:25,451 --> 01:34:26,284
I'm just trying to,

1586
01:34:26,350 --> 01:34:29,230
I'm trying to turn on the lights to
all your traps that you sit, you know?

1587
01:34:29,290 --> 01:34:32,530
So it's Kinda like that thing just
comes with like the type of training.

1588
01:34:32,531 --> 01:34:36,560
Like you can't regard the
training as a competition. Yeah.

1589
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:41,440
You got to go in and be like, you are
not learning anything. Yeah. But man,

1590
01:34:41,441 --> 01:34:44,710
you know, in a war battle or in a
competition scenario, it's like,

1591
01:34:46,270 --> 01:34:50,970
I'm trying to think if I ever got played
like that on the battlefield. You know,

1592
01:34:50,980 --> 01:34:54,790
sometimes we'd hit a target
and it was real obvious that,

1593
01:34:56,130 --> 01:34:57,040
you know,
we had,

1594
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:00,620
I wouldn't say set up,
but like there's no one there.

1595
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:04,520
Like clearly the information that we
got was wrong and you'd be kind of like

1596
01:35:04,521 --> 01:35:08,870
Dang, you know, be like man that
that wasn't good. And it really,

1597
01:35:08,871 --> 01:35:12,860
on a real rudimentary level it,
that's what an IED is. You know,

1598
01:35:12,861 --> 01:35:15,780
it's like they want to make it
look like a trashcan or a regular,

1599
01:35:15,781 --> 01:35:18,430
there's something you have to address
or something like that. You know, some,

1600
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:21,240
a place where you have to go anyway,
the road, I don't know what a,

1601
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:23,360
on a real simple level,
that's kind of what that is.

1602
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:26,620
So now you're like shooting all,
we've got to be weary of everyday things,

1603
01:35:26,690 --> 01:35:30,670
normal protocol. We've got to be
weary of that. That's a, that's a,

1604
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:34,640
that's a digger on the psychology
for sure. Back to the book.

1605
01:35:34,670 --> 01:35:38,960
I do not care for either one.
Oh sorry.

1606
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:40,460
It's his lines and entrenchment.

1607
01:35:40,461 --> 01:35:43,730
So he's talking about lines and
entrenchments meaning defensive positions.

1608
01:35:44,150 --> 01:35:48,890
I do not care for either the
one or the other of these works.

1609
01:35:49,370 --> 01:35:50,810
When I hear talk of lines,

1610
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:55,100
I always think I am hearing
of talk of the walls of China.

1611
01:35:56,480 --> 01:36:01,480
The good ones are those that nature has
made and the good entrenchments are good

1612
01:36:02,031 --> 01:36:04,970
dispositions and brave soldiers.

1613
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:07,790
Again,

1614
01:36:07,790 --> 01:36:12,260
just capitalizing on nature and saying
that brave soldiers are more important

1615
01:36:12,261 --> 01:36:13,610
than your position.

1616
01:36:15,890 --> 01:36:20,870
Man always fears the consequences
of danger more than danger itself.

1617
01:36:22,190 --> 01:36:25,670
Totally true.
When,

1618
01:36:25,671 --> 01:36:29,480
and I'll tell you what's equally or
you could throw in there as the w the

1619
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:34,410
anticipation of danger is probably
the worst thing. You know,

1620
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:35,060
I see this,

1621
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:37,910
I see a lot of kids on the wrestling mat
right now cause it's wrestling season

1622
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:42,050
and you can see kids get nervous
before they get on the map,

1623
01:36:42,051 --> 01:36:44,180
but then once to get them the math
during the game and now you're,

1624
01:36:44,181 --> 01:36:48,140
now you're doing your job. But the
anticipation of what could happen. Yeah.

1625
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:51,290
Drives people crazy. When
is that like, you know,

1626
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:54,830
cause you gotta you felt that before
bringing it back to the day when we were

1627
01:36:54,831 --> 01:36:58,610
competing. Yeah. That
like Jujitsu tournament.

1628
01:36:58,620 --> 01:37:01,220
Civil war especially back actually your,

1629
01:37:01,610 --> 01:37:06,050
one of your last competition was
my first competition or way? Yeah.

1630
01:37:06,410 --> 01:37:11,270
Where was that in la? It's called like
the Pan Am's of submission grappling.

1631
01:37:11,271 --> 01:37:12,720
It wasn't the Pan Am's Pan Ams.

1632
01:37:12,810 --> 01:37:17,030
It was like I think like submission
grappling and it was, no, how did I do?

1633
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:19,310
Uh, I dunno. I Dunno. I remember,

1634
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:23,210
remember I remember seeing all the
pictures cause one of the, it's funny,

1635
01:37:23,211 --> 01:37:25,940
one of the like tournament,
it was a tournament. Yeah.

1636
01:37:25,970 --> 01:37:29,890
So I remember Alicia photos.
Remember that Anna who ran it?

1637
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:31,400
Who ran the tournament?
I have no idea.

1638
01:37:31,401 --> 01:37:36,170
I didn't even know there was tournaments
and I saw one hour or brand at the time

1639
01:37:36,171 --> 01:37:38,540
was like, yeah, the term. I was like, oh
we can have tournament. I was like boom.

1640
01:37:38,541 --> 01:37:40,760
So I just jumped on it real quick.
What was the iconic photo?

1641
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:46,240
I say it's iconic because it's a kind
of a much strong word, a very strong,

1642
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:49,760
it's not a clinic at all actually,
but it's okay. I'm so, I'm, we,

1643
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:53,030
I have this guy,
his name is Jim.

1644
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:56,100
You'll probably know Jim. He, uh,

1645
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:58,470
I have him in a,
it's not an American,

1646
01:37:58,471 --> 01:38:02,360
it's a straight arm lock and
I wound up tapping him out.

1647
01:38:02,430 --> 01:38:05,610
And Alicia photos though.
That was the photographer at the time.

1648
01:38:05,630 --> 01:38:09,390
The main one really good picture of it.
It was such a good picture.

1649
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:12,360
It was in the front of her
website. The picture. Right.

1650
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:16,810
That's why I call it iconic photo
full on this.

1651
01:38:16,890 --> 01:38:18,600
Everyone knows that photo.
Everyone,

1652
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:21,060
they probably do if they're
competing back in the day,

1653
01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:25,480
if they know Lisa Phillips Anyway, um,
the full on like novice division. Right.

1654
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:28,290
I was like, I had been trying for
two months, twice a week, by the way,

1655
01:38:29,130 --> 01:38:30,360
for two months. Boom. Enough.

1656
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:35,010
I'm still just dominating
out there right now.

1657
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:39,510
I actually lost, I lost my
first match. Took third.
Nonetheless, it doesn't matter.

1658
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:43,770
Um, so I know that you did it because
when I was looking through the pictures,

1659
01:38:43,771 --> 01:38:46,590
it was you compete,
I think you were competing against like,

1660
01:38:46,591 --> 01:38:48,690
so could you or somebody I think,

1661
01:38:49,550 --> 01:38:53,490
but I remember [inaudible] yeah,
well it was maybe, I don't know,

1662
01:38:53,491 --> 01:38:56,430
some other black guy, but I don't
know. I remember it was you,

1663
01:38:56,431 --> 01:38:57,900
cause I remember like you,

1664
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:01,350
I'll have to check that out and
then the last to explore that.

1665
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:05,610
But what was the point that, oh
yeah, waiting for the match is like,

1666
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:08,490
that's the nerve wracking part.
Like growling,

1667
01:39:08,550 --> 01:39:10,770
even when you step on the match and
you see the guy in front of you getting

1668
01:39:10,771 --> 01:39:13,590
right by, that's not nerve racking at
all. That's like everyday you see that

1669
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:19,060
iconic picture of Sarge is a pretty
iconic, and he, it was going against

1670
01:39:20,980 --> 01:39:23,740
one of the Gracies kids.

1671
01:39:23,770 --> 01:39:28,770
So it was Henner or I think it was
Hallock was at Holland and he's,

1672
01:39:29,650 --> 01:39:31,230
but he's double like him.
You know what I'm talking,

1673
01:39:31,710 --> 01:39:34,270
sergeants got like the
sadness double heck,

1674
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:39,220
which sergeant has a savage is
another thing. When I see these,

1675
01:39:39,610 --> 01:39:41,150
by the way, talking about
Brian, sergeant, uh,

1676
01:39:41,170 --> 01:39:45,040
one of my buddies who has a Jiu
Jitsu school in Connecticut,

1677
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:49,660
it's called Jujitsu life,
but he is,

1678
01:39:49,930 --> 01:39:53,230
he's a good wrestler.
But when I see these kids and he,

1679
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:55,900
he wrestled a Poway high
school, which is, uh,

1680
01:39:56,470 --> 01:40:01,120
one of the best wrestling high
schools maybe in the country.

1681
01:40:01,210 --> 01:40:05,440
I mean, it's definitely
incredible program. And he
went there and wrestled there.

1682
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:10,800
And I see occasionally I'll see a kid
that's just has sergeants attitude.

1683
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:15,540
And I saw one of this last tournament,
this kid was just all over it and go,

1684
01:40:15,550 --> 01:40:18,120
I mean, it looked, it
didn't look fair, right?

1685
01:40:18,310 --> 01:40:21,310
I mean he was just murdering this
kid from Poway was getting after.

1686
01:40:21,311 --> 01:40:25,540
It was pretty awesome to watch
and you could see just boom, boom,

1687
01:40:25,541 --> 01:40:26,620
boom is hitting the devils.

1688
01:40:26,621 --> 01:40:31,621
But it reminded me of the
iconic picture of Sarge.

1689
01:40:33,370 --> 01:40:36,070
Oh, there's a picture of it. So
yeah, there's a picture of sergeant.

1690
01:40:36,071 --> 01:40:37,720
They put him on. They, it was, it was,

1691
01:40:37,810 --> 01:40:40,840
it was one of those pictures that was
so good that they put it like on the

1692
01:40:40,870 --> 01:40:41,890
covers,
I think.

1693
01:40:42,130 --> 01:40:44,710
I don't know if it was that one or
if it happened later in the match.

1694
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:48,970
He was double liking him out of bounds,
like he was into the table.

1695
01:40:52,570 --> 01:40:55,440
So you gotta, you gotta Watch
out for sergeant double legs,

1696
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:57,700
they'll put you on your,
I asked quick. Yup.

1697
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:02,650
And he wants to start one.
Hard to submit.

1698
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:06,010
So like you just got taken
down. That's two points, right?

1699
01:41:06,550 --> 01:41:11,140
And now what are you going to do?
Because you can't sweep sarge right card.

1700
01:41:11,170 --> 01:41:12,850
I mean, of course you
can, but it's hard. Yeah.

1701
01:41:13,090 --> 01:41:17,410
You only have a few minutes
and it's hard to submit. Oh,

1702
01:41:17,411 --> 01:41:21,150
but you got back to your feet. Cool.
He just got taken out of. Yeah. Yeah.

1703
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:25,930
That's the rub with the real good judo
guys are wrestling guys. That's the rub.

1704
01:41:26,170 --> 01:41:29,540
What's the rub? Oh, how do you solve that
problem? Me become a better wrestler,

1705
01:41:31,150 --> 01:41:33,940
typically. That's not
it. Yeah, Tyrone Woodley,

1706
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,330
Tyrone Woodley fought
Damian my year and Damien.

1707
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:42,520
Damien is an incredible Jujitsu player
and he couldn't get tiring down to the

1708
01:41:42,521 --> 01:41:45,910
mat.
And every time he shot I would hit my son.

1709
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:49,720
And because every time,
every time Damian shot,

1710
01:41:50,350 --> 01:41:53,490
he would s tire and would just stuff
the shot and I hit my son and go,

1711
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:55,870
that's why you wrestle.
That's where you Russell boy,

1712
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:58,180
because you are going to be
able to take people down.

1713
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:00,820
And then once you get to the ground,
if you have the Jujitsu,

1714
01:42:00,910 --> 01:42:03,670
well now you've got problems because
the tire and didn't want to go to the

1715
01:42:03,671 --> 01:42:07,330
ground with Damien. No, because that
would have been very problematic for him.

1716
01:42:07,870 --> 01:42:11,190
But Tyron Woodley is a wrestler.
Oh you know,

1717
01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:15,550
was that you who said that the difference
between someone who can wrestle versus

1718
01:42:15,730 --> 01:42:18,860
a restless wasn't mean laser.

1719
01:42:19,210 --> 01:42:21,340
And that's why I say
that's not the problem.

1720
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:25,810
That's why I say that's not the solution.
If you have a wrestler,

1721
01:42:25,811 --> 01:42:28,420
all of these taking you down and the
solution is to get better or ethylene the

1722
01:42:28,430 --> 01:42:31,780
sound solution because you want to get
better at something that this guy is

1723
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:34,090
probably getting better. And
this is just, chances are,

1724
01:42:34,091 --> 01:42:37,510
I'm not saying it's an absolute,
but he's probably a getting better,

1725
01:42:37,540 --> 01:42:39,550
be already super good at it.

1726
01:42:39,551 --> 01:42:42,490
So it's like the solution is that you
say something and he's 12 years ahead of

1727
01:42:42,491 --> 01:42:46,540
you. Yeah. He's eight years ahead
of you in a wrestling. Yeah. Yeah.

1728
01:42:46,541 --> 01:42:49,690
So that's not the solution. I don't know
what to do. I'm not saying don't wrestle.

1729
01:42:49,870 --> 01:42:52,810
Well I think I'll tell you what the s
what I think the solution is off the top

1730
01:42:52,811 --> 01:42:53,470
of my head.

1731
01:42:53,470 --> 01:42:56,800
You learn enough wrestling and then
you figured out how to incorporate your

1732
01:42:56,801 --> 01:43:00,610
Jujitsu into the wrestling. So that,
and I say this all the time and,

1733
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:03,480
and dean will tell you the same thing.
Dean will,

1734
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:08,760
a dean will hesitate to
shoot on me because he knows
there's significant threats

1735
01:43:08,891 --> 01:43:09,724
there.

1736
01:43:09,730 --> 01:43:12,160
He'll shoot all day on a good wrestler
because he doesn't care what happens.

1737
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:15,790
They're not going to, they're not
going to catch him most likely. I mean,

1738
01:43:15,850 --> 01:43:20,320
obviously I did Jujitsu wrestler, it's
can happen, but, and I feel the same way.

1739
01:43:20,321 --> 01:43:23,410
I'll shoot, I'll shoot all day on a,
on a good wrestler cause I don't care.

1740
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:25,090
They're not going to catch me anything.
And if they do,

1741
01:43:25,091 --> 01:43:29,590
I'll be able to do the proper
defense and escape it. But Dean, no.

1742
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:33,730
Like no, that's a real problem. Same with
Andy. You shoot on Andy, you're, you know,

1743
01:43:33,731 --> 01:43:36,700
it's like okay that can be problematic
and not even just pay for it.

1744
01:43:36,701 --> 01:43:41,230
You can lose right there. Yeah.
Yeah. Andy and I have been a problem.

1745
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:45,090
Whoever shoots Lou,
whoever shoots loses. Yeah.

1746
01:43:45,410 --> 01:43:49,940
Cause we're both have good anti wrestling.
So yeah, that's it. That's the pro.

1747
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:52,940
That's the solution there.
You've got to figure out that the counter,

1748
01:43:52,941 --> 01:43:56,570
the Kryptonite to the wrestling, right.
In whatever way. Cause that's not just,

1749
01:43:56,571 --> 01:44:00,440
Oh yeah, just do that. That's not how it
is. It, it's, but that's the direction.

1750
01:44:00,441 --> 01:44:04,340
That's the solution.
There's problems with that.

1751
01:44:05,390 --> 01:44:06,470
Well there's not problems with that.

1752
01:44:06,690 --> 01:44:10,640
One of the easiest ways is to be very,

1753
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:12,110
I guess this is a problem,

1754
01:44:12,170 --> 01:44:17,170
is to be very non aggressive because if
all you're trying to do is avoid getting

1755
01:44:18,621 --> 01:44:21,410
taken down,
you already are,

1756
01:44:21,470 --> 01:44:24,680
are a lot harder to take
down than if you're like,

1757
01:44:24,710 --> 01:44:27,350
if I go in and start trying
to take down a wrestler,

1758
01:44:27,530 --> 01:44:30,860
they're going to put me on my ass because
I'm trying to take them and they know

1759
01:44:30,980 --> 01:44:32,810
their counters that much better
than timings that much better.

1760
01:44:32,930 --> 01:44:35,450
They hit the switch phone.
I'll also, I'm down, you know,

1761
01:44:35,930 --> 01:44:38,270
but if I'm just trying to avoid you,

1762
01:44:38,271 --> 01:44:40,220
it's the same thing with somebody that's
a really good striker. If you're just,

1763
01:44:40,221 --> 01:44:41,031
if your goal is to,

1764
01:44:41,031 --> 01:44:43,550
if you start striking with the
Stryker that's better than you,

1765
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:45,650
you are more likely to get knocked out.

1766
01:44:45,651 --> 01:44:49,070
You're more Luton like to get hit because
you're playing there. That's the point.

1767
01:44:49,071 --> 01:44:52,670
You're playing their game and you
don't want to play their game.

1768
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:56,570
Now what sucks about that, and it
even happened to Tyron Woodley fight.

1769
01:44:56,930 --> 01:44:59,990
It was a boring fight because
it was shots getting stuffed.

1770
01:45:00,140 --> 01:45:03,740
Stand up just a little. Some striking
shots, getting stuffed, stand up to play,

1771
01:45:03,741 --> 01:45:06,050
striking shots, getting stuff.
That's what the fight was.

1772
01:45:06,110 --> 01:45:11,110
It was a very boring fight because his
goal is to not get taken down and he's a

1773
01:45:11,301 --> 01:45:14,480
wrestler, so he had the capability
of doing it and that was that.

1774
01:45:15,710 --> 01:45:19,400
I'll tell you what it does, what
you do for, for wrestling situation,

1775
01:45:20,210 --> 01:45:22,280
one of the simple,
it's not easy at all,

1776
01:45:22,370 --> 01:45:27,370
but you find a way to get
to the back from the bottle.

1777
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:32,030
Well, yeah, that's great. Yeah. You
find a way to submit mum, submit them.

1778
01:45:32,031 --> 01:45:36,730
That's great to get to the,
because depend told me them to their band,

1779
01:45:36,850 --> 01:45:40,520
get on their back.
So for sure on their back he was,

1780
01:45:41,750 --> 01:45:45,580
he told me this when he was going
to fight Chael Sonnen [inaudible] a

1781
01:45:45,670 --> 01:45:48,530
[inaudible] and he was like, he
was like, yeah, it's interesting.

1782
01:45:48,531 --> 01:45:51,390
Fighting wrestlers or whatever.
It's like they can provide like that.

1783
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:52,850
I'm totally paraphrasing.

1784
01:45:52,970 --> 01:45:57,970
They can provide these really hard
situations for you in Jujitsu for many

1785
01:45:58,731 --> 01:46:02,450
reasons of super hard and hard people
to fight. But if you can figure it out,

1786
01:46:02,451 --> 01:46:06,660
you got to figure out ways where
wrestling provides weaknesses in an in,

1787
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:10,490
in a Jujitsu scenario. Yeah. And then
if you watch the match, sure enough,

1788
01:46:10,491 --> 01:46:15,090
like he was [inaudible] was really
good at stuffing stuff in stuffing,

1789
01:46:15,110 --> 01:46:16,580
stuffing and then you could see golf.

1790
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:19,820
I was like just slowly and then he got
to the guts of the bat and I used to

1791
01:46:19,910 --> 01:46:24,910
coach Dean with the same idea of do
you know if he was going against a good

1792
01:46:26,631 --> 01:46:29,430
wrestler? I'd say use your Jujitsu if
he's going against, get good Jujitsu guy,

1793
01:46:29,431 --> 01:46:30,264
guide,
say use your wrestling.

1794
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:35,920
Dean would have a tendency because of his
personality to want to go against them

1795
01:46:37,131 --> 01:46:40,160
in their strength.
So he tried out wrestle wrestlers.

1796
01:46:40,340 --> 01:46:43,120
He tried out Jujitsu attributes,
you guys? He would, he would,

1797
01:46:43,121 --> 01:46:47,540
that's his natural tendency would be to
go at people's strengths and I'd have to

1798
01:46:47,541 --> 01:46:48,410
like say no,

1799
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:52,230
do Jujitsu against this guy and then
he'd do it and get what he needed to get.

1800
01:46:57,640 --> 01:46:59,760
All right back to the book.

1801
01:46:59,761 --> 01:47:03,120
When one is obliged to
defend entrenchments,

1802
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:08,600
one should post all the
battalions directly behind
the parapet because if once

1803
01:47:09,241 --> 01:47:10,890
the enemy sets foot upon that,

1804
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:15,090
those in the rear we'll think of
nothing but to save themselves.

1805
01:47:15,630 --> 01:47:20,630
This is because of the consternation
in men when something happens that they

1806
01:47:20,761 --> 01:47:24,180
have not expected.
Again,

1807
01:47:24,530 --> 01:47:26,010
conservation is shock,

1808
01:47:26,490 --> 01:47:31,490
so he's again emphasizing the fact that
when people aren't expecting something,

1809
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:37,460
it is a major down her for it's
a major down for Macquarie.

1810
01:47:37,950 --> 01:47:42,030
It interrupts what's happening and that's
why you got to think of contingencies.

1811
01:47:42,031 --> 01:47:43,430
That's one of the biggest things that,
well,

1812
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:46,320
one of the best things about thinking
about contingencies is just that you're

1813
01:47:46,321 --> 01:47:46,720
aware of.

1814
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:50,430
It's going to have that you've thought
about it for half a second big tip that

1815
01:47:50,431 --> 01:47:52,620
makes you so much better
off getting caught complete,

1816
01:47:53,010 --> 01:47:56,070
getting caught completely off guard.
I mean this happens in Jujitsu.

1817
01:47:56,370 --> 01:47:59,770
The thing that you get caught with is the
thing that you didn't see coming. Yeah,

1818
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:01,290
that's,
that's the thing that catches you.

1819
01:48:01,291 --> 01:48:05,160
The thing that surprises you and you're
like, how'd that happen? It surprise you.

1820
01:48:05,161 --> 01:48:08,340
That's what you get caught with.
Even like in your house?

1821
01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:12,150
Like that's the one I think of a lot
where you know when you're in your house

1822
01:48:12,151 --> 01:48:14,880
and, and if you think of like what
if there's someone in here? Oh yeah,

1823
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,960
right now you're not even necessarily
of how scary that would be necessarily,

1824
01:48:18,961 --> 01:48:21,060
but it's like, okay, what
if there's someone in here,

1825
01:48:21,270 --> 01:48:24,420
at least I'm ready for the fact
that someone's in here, my daughter,

1826
01:48:24,450 --> 01:48:27,900
my eight year old daughter
will try and scare me. Yeah.

1827
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:33,440
And she'll hide somewhere
and if I don't expect it,

1828
01:48:33,930 --> 01:48:37,830
I get started get and then, and
then what I do is I just, you know,

1829
01:48:37,831 --> 01:48:41,760
you're talking about punishments?
No. What? I know I punished myself.

1830
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:46,170
So she's shows she scared
me twice last year.

1831
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:48,510
Like that actually made
me a little bit startled.

1832
01:48:48,511 --> 01:48:52,530
She tried to 98 times 96
of them were ineffective,

1833
01:48:54,870 --> 01:48:57,570
but I'll tell you what,
I, I punished myself

1834
01:48:59,310 --> 01:49:03,270
burpee school and then,
but I really enjoy scaring people.

1835
01:49:03,340 --> 01:49:05,160
It's sure a lot.
I don't know why.

1836
01:49:05,190 --> 01:49:08,910
I find it very entertaining
and funny and satisfying.

1837
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:13,500
So I do, when I scare
people, like makes them cry.

1838
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:19,770
Have you scare him? Do you do the like
the loud noise one or do you think, yeah.

1839
01:49:19,950 --> 01:49:23,060
You know, cause a lot of times the loud
noise isn't the scary thing. Right.

1840
01:49:23,070 --> 01:49:26,230
And sometimes the scratching
at the window is a lot. Yeah.

1841
01:49:26,340 --> 01:49:27,720
Sometimes you think you're home alone,

1842
01:49:27,721 --> 01:49:30,360
you think your dad's calling and then all
of a sudden there's like scratching at

1843
01:49:30,361 --> 01:49:33,300
the window and then there's a noise of
the door opening and you start calling

1844
01:49:33,301 --> 01:49:34,890
out for your dad but he doesn't answer.

1845
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:38,220
And then there's more scratching at the
window and then all of a sudden there's

1846
01:49:38,221 --> 01:49:41,760
someone with a mask on the coating.
You can do that.

1847
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:47,230
That's a violation. You can't do that
with. But I do do that. Yeah. Yeah.

1848
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:48,250
So anyways,

1849
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:52,820
that's that. Back to the book, he said,

1850
01:49:52,990 --> 01:49:54,920
well let me catch us up to where we,

1851
01:49:54,930 --> 01:49:59,930
we're talking about the shock that
happens when people don't expect something

1852
01:50:01,150 --> 01:50:01,751
back to the book.

1853
01:50:01,751 --> 01:50:06,370
This is a general rule in war and
decides all battles and all actions.

1854
01:50:07,570 --> 01:50:12,010
It comes from the human heart and he's
what induced me to compose this work.

1855
01:50:12,190 --> 01:50:15,160
I do not believe that anyone
yet has attempted to find their,

1856
01:50:15,580 --> 01:50:19,840
find their the reasons for the
poor success of armies. Thus,

1857
01:50:19,841 --> 01:50:22,450
when you have stationed your
troops behind a pair of put,

1858
01:50:22,451 --> 01:50:26,500
they hope by their fire to prevent the
enemy from passing the ditch and mounting

1859
01:50:26,501 --> 01:50:30,550
it. If this happens in spite of the fire
and they give themselves up for lost,

1860
01:50:30,670 --> 01:50:34,600
lose their heads and fly, it would
be much better to post a single rank.

1861
01:50:34,601 --> 01:50:38,500
There aren't pikes whose business will
be to push these st went back as fast as

1862
01:50:38,501 --> 01:50:39,340
they attempt to mount,

1863
01:50:39,730 --> 01:50:44,730
and certainly they will execute this
duty because it is what they expect and

1864
01:50:45,101 --> 01:50:49,150
what they prepared for.
If with this,

1865
01:50:49,330 --> 01:50:52,990
you post infantry formed according
to my method into centuries,

1866
01:50:52,991 --> 01:50:55,600
at a distance of 30 paces
from the entrenchment,

1867
01:50:55,840 --> 01:51:00,340
these troops will see that they are placed
there to charge the enemy as fast as

1868
01:51:00,341 --> 01:51:02,650
he enters and attempts to form.

1869
01:51:02,830 --> 01:51:07,330
They will not be astonished to see the
enemy enter because they expect it and

1870
01:51:07,331 --> 01:51:10,510
we'll charge vigorously.
Instead,

1871
01:51:10,511 --> 01:51:14,050
if instead they had been placed on
the parapet, they would have fled.

1872
01:51:15,310 --> 01:51:20,310
That is how a trifle changes everything
in war and how human weaknesses cannot

1873
01:51:21,191 --> 01:51:24,670
be managed except by allowing for them.

1874
01:51:26,710 --> 01:51:28,870
That's,
that's heavy right there.

1875
01:51:29,710 --> 01:51:34,090
Human weaknesses cannot be managed.
You have to allow for them.

1876
01:51:34,091 --> 01:51:37,570
Think about that, that, you know, you
have to do that all time as a leader,

1877
01:51:38,020 --> 01:51:38,560
you have to,

1878
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:41,110
well you have to try and do it as a
leader because if you don't try and manage

1879
01:51:41,111 --> 01:51:46,060
these weaknesses, you, you,
you don't allow for them,

1880
01:51:46,210 --> 01:51:49,000
then they're going to, they're going
to jam you up as you would say.

1881
01:51:49,730 --> 01:51:52,200
So you've got somebody with
a big ego, you, you to put,

1882
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:55,900
you gotta put them in a situation where
that ego's gonna flourish and not be

1883
01:51:55,901 --> 01:51:57,940
offended. And, and when
it does get offended,

1884
01:51:57,941 --> 01:52:00,070
you got to allow for that and
how you're going to adapt to it.

1885
01:52:01,430 --> 01:52:05,480
It's like expecting perfection, you know?
You know, like if you expect perfection,

1886
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:08,530
yeah, well you're going to be let
down a bunch. This is what I'm saying.

1887
01:52:08,530 --> 01:52:12,490
So if you allow for imperfection is going
to, you can, you can just manage better.

1888
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:15,220
So there's two major points,
you know, number one,

1889
01:52:15,221 --> 01:52:17,650
if you set people up so
that what they expect,

1890
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:20,080
what they expect to happen happens,

1891
01:52:20,350 --> 01:52:24,820
they're going to have a better chance
of achieving what it is you want them to

1892
01:52:24,821 --> 01:52:25,654
achieve.

1893
01:52:26,050 --> 01:52:29,770
Because if these guys are in the parapet
and all of a sudden they get run upon

1894
01:52:29,830 --> 01:52:33,610
and they're surprised by it and their
mission was defend the pair of pit,

1895
01:52:33,611 --> 01:52:36,340
well now they're, they're getting
overrun. Whereas if you say no,

1896
01:52:36,341 --> 01:52:39,190
once they pair up, it gets
taken, you attack. Now they're,

1897
01:52:39,220 --> 01:52:40,230
they know the parapets going,

1898
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:42,580
it's not going to be surprised them they
expected to happen and then when they,

1899
01:52:42,710 --> 01:52:46,070
they get the opportunity, they're going
to get in there and get after it. But man,

1900
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:50,540
allowing the,
the manage managing human weakness,

1901
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:55,790
Oh, you only way you can do
this by allowing for it. At
least some measure of it.

1902
01:52:56,170 --> 01:52:59,720
Yeah. Good. Good lesson learned.

1903
01:52:59,721 --> 01:53:03,530
That's something you can think about as
you lead people. You can think about,

1904
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:07,010
hey man, this is a little weakness
here and if I don't allow for that,

1905
01:53:07,011 --> 01:53:11,060
I don't give that some room
and I count on, you know, uh,

1906
01:53:11,150 --> 01:53:14,720
Flynn Flynn from echelon front,
newest member of echelon front,

1907
01:53:14,721 --> 01:53:16,850
but he just wrote an article about a guy,

1908
01:53:16,851 --> 01:53:21,851
he was stationed on a ship before he got
to the teams and he was saying this guy

1909
01:53:23,510 --> 01:53:27,400
had been late for work and,
but he was trying to bring the guy along.

1910
01:53:27,401 --> 01:53:32,360
He had a lot of potential,
blah, blah, blah. Anyways,
they go to actually do a, uh,

1911
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:36,560
important training with their weapons
on the ship that they were on.

1912
01:53:36,770 --> 01:53:39,080
And the guy missed the ship leaving port

1913
01:53:40,730 --> 01:53:42,710
and he says,
you know,

1914
01:53:42,770 --> 01:53:45,290
I should have fired the guy
before this and now I'm out here.

1915
01:53:45,290 --> 01:53:49,610
I don't have this primary guy and he
let down me and let down the ship and

1916
01:53:49,611 --> 01:53:52,580
everything like that. But he didn't
account for human weakness. He, you know,

1917
01:53:52,581 --> 01:53:55,370
he fought that he could bring this
guy along, but he just, you know,

1918
01:53:55,371 --> 01:53:58,220
it's one of those things if you don't
allow for that human weakness in there,

1919
01:53:58,550 --> 01:54:02,480
you might be, you might be getting
left high and dry, which is not good.

1920
01:54:02,481 --> 01:54:07,040
That's on the made that thing
on the echelon front webpage,

1921
01:54:08,330 --> 01:54:11,510
which is called the platoon hut.

1922
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:16,760
And it was just like writing little,
I guess it could be referred to as a blog.

1923
01:54:18,230 --> 01:54:21,650
It's not really a blog or the blog to
me seems a very, you know, just hey,

1924
01:54:21,651 --> 01:54:25,130
we're going to write whatever blog.
So this is, this is some little,

1925
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:28,010
I guess you might want to
call them articles. Yeah.

1926
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:30,650
And there's like let like let little
lessons. Yeah, yeah, of course.

1927
01:54:30,660 --> 01:54:34,830
Little lessons I, yeah, I liked, I
didn't enjoy platoon hut the whole,

1928
01:54:34,980 --> 01:54:35,813
the whole time.

1929
01:54:36,050 --> 01:54:39,680
And the reason we call it a platoon
hood is because that's where you'd sit

1930
01:54:39,681 --> 01:54:43,730
around and talk shop. I guess we
were talking about other things,

1931
01:54:43,731 --> 01:54:47,210
but when you get back from a training op,
because when you're overseas you,

1932
01:54:47,211 --> 01:54:48,080
you still have a platoon hub,

1933
01:54:48,081 --> 01:54:50,810
but it's not the platoon and I guess it
is the platoon not, but anyways, yeah,

1934
01:54:50,811 --> 01:54:52,920
even there. So when you get back from
an operation, you'd come into debrief,

1935
01:54:52,921 --> 01:54:54,890
debriefing you,
you get done with the official debrief,

1936
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:58,590
but then you go into the platoon hood,
Hey, you should do this. And so, yeah.

1937
01:54:58,730 --> 01:55:02,030
So that's one of those,
he as a young

1938
01:55:03,710 --> 01:55:08,660
surface warfare officer in the Navy didn't
allow for the human weakness of this

1939
01:55:08,720 --> 01:55:10,280
young sailor and in costume

1940
01:55:13,430 --> 01:55:15,980
going back to the book,

1941
01:55:16,020 --> 01:55:20,060
the Greeks were very skillful in
the art of war and well disciplined,

1942
01:55:20,540 --> 01:55:25,220
but they're large Phalanx was never
able to contend with the small bodies of

1943
01:55:25,221 --> 01:55:28,550
Romans dis disposed in this formation.

1944
01:55:29,870 --> 01:55:31,280
Now he goes on to,

1945
01:55:31,820 --> 01:55:36,820
there's a guy named [inaudible] and he
goes on to quote a huge chunk of text

1946
01:55:38,211 --> 01:55:40,700
from police because police
was a Greek historian.

1947
01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:46,960
And [inaudible] actually talked about
why the Roman armies could defeat the

1948
01:55:47,851 --> 01:55:52,851
failings and pretty interesting.

1949
01:55:54,390 --> 01:55:55,650
So here's what he said.

1950
01:55:55,680 --> 01:56:00,240
It is easy to demonstrate by many reasons
that while the failings retains its

1951
01:56:00,241 --> 01:56:02,730
proper form and full power of action,

1952
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:07,940
no force is able to stand against it
in front or in support of the violent

1953
01:56:08,641 --> 01:56:10,950
attack.
So while the Phalanx is in order,

1954
01:56:11,310 --> 01:56:12,720
you're not going to be able to defeat it.

1955
01:56:12,810 --> 01:56:17,810
So the Phalanx is a military formation
and he talks a little bit about what it's

1956
01:56:18,181 --> 01:56:19,440
made up of here.

1957
01:56:19,860 --> 01:56:24,860
When the ranks are closed in order to
engage each shoulder as he stands with his

1958
01:56:25,501 --> 01:56:30,000
arms, occupies a space of three feet.
The spears in their ancient form,

1959
01:56:30,030 --> 01:56:33,690
we're 17 cubits long.
A cubit is about 18 inches,

1960
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:38,730
but for the sake of rendering
them more commodious and actions,

1961
01:56:38,731 --> 01:56:43,731
they have since been reduced to 14 of
these four cubits are contained between

1962
01:56:44,251 --> 01:56:48,330
the part which the soldier grasps in
his hands and the lower end of the spear

1963
01:56:48,331 --> 01:56:53,040
behind which serves as a counterpoint
to the part that is extended before him

1964
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:57,810
and when and the length of this last
part from the body of the soldier.

1965
01:56:57,811 --> 01:57:02,160
When the spear is pushed forwards with
both hands against the enemy is in

1966
01:57:02,161 --> 01:57:06,210
consequence 10 cubic cubits from.

1967
01:57:06,211 --> 01:57:10,050
Hence it follows that when the Phalanx
is closed and it's proper form,

1968
01:57:10,410 --> 01:57:14,920
every soldier pressed within the necessary
distance with respect to the man that

1969
01:57:14,921 --> 01:57:18,510
has before him and on his side
the spears of the fifth rank,

1970
01:57:18,511 --> 01:57:22,560
our extended to the length of two
cubits and those are the second,

1971
01:57:22,561 --> 01:57:26,010
third and fourth two is still greater
length beyond the formal strength.

1972
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:31,760
It is manifest manifest then that several
spears differing each other in the

1973
01:57:32,971 --> 01:57:37,971
length of two cubits are extended before
every man in the foremost rank and when

1974
01:57:38,491 --> 01:57:43,260
it is considered likewise that the
Phalanx is formed by 16 in depth,

1975
01:57:43,410 --> 01:57:48,410
it will be easy to conceive what must
be the weight and violence of the entire

1976
01:57:48,961 --> 01:57:52,380
body and how great the
force of its attack.

1977
01:57:52,590 --> 01:57:57,030
So you got guys 16 people deep,

1978
01:57:57,090 --> 01:58:02,090
16 people deep and they've
got these spears and they
adjust the spears depending

1979
01:58:03,301 --> 01:58:04,340
on where you are in the ranks.

1980
01:58:04,341 --> 01:58:08,580
So the guy that's five ranks back still
has a little bit of his spear sticking

1981
01:58:08,581 --> 01:58:11,520
out. And by the way, if one
of those guys goes down,

1982
01:58:11,521 --> 01:58:15,060
there's another 14 people
there ready to take his place.

1983
01:58:15,210 --> 01:58:16,830
So the Phalanx was locked together.

1984
01:58:16,831 --> 01:58:21,831
The shields protecting the person to
your left and it's like a porcupine of

1985
01:58:23,250 --> 01:58:28,250
death locked together and obviously the
the Greeks were hardcore warriors and

1986
01:58:33,390 --> 01:58:36,150
this is what they use and
they use to crush people.

1987
01:58:36,150 --> 01:58:39,720
Would this Phalanx crush them? Spears
and shields, that's all you see

1988
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:46,320
now plebe IOUs talks about what the
Romans did and what their setup was.

1989
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:51,580
Back to the book to each of the
Roman soldiers as he stands in arms,

1990
01:58:51,581 --> 01:58:53,800
is a lot of the same space of three feet.

1991
01:58:54,010 --> 01:58:59,010
But as every soldier in time of
action is constantly in motion,

1992
01:58:59,261 --> 01:59:03,910
being forced to shift this
shield continuously so that
he may cover any part of

1993
01:59:03,911 --> 01:59:08,380
his body against which a stroke is aimed
and to vary the position of his sword

1994
01:59:08,530 --> 01:59:11,470
so as to either push or
to make a falling stroke.

1995
01:59:11,620 --> 01:59:13,930
There must be also a
distance of three feet.

1996
01:59:14,170 --> 01:59:18,010
The least that can be allowed for
performing these motions with advantage

1997
01:59:18,011 --> 01:59:21,910
between each soldier and the
man that stands next to him,

1998
01:59:21,911 --> 01:59:25,750
both on his side and behind him. So the
Romans are in the same similar position,

1999
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:30,970
but they're moving individually inside
these little positions so they're not

2000
01:59:30,971 --> 01:59:33,400
working together. They're,
they're more mobile.

2001
01:59:34,750 --> 01:59:37,300
It will be easy therefore
to conceive that wall,

2002
01:59:37,301 --> 01:59:42,160
the Phalanx retains its proper
position and strengths. No troops,

2003
01:59:42,220 --> 01:59:46,090
as I have before observed can, uh,
support the attack of it in front.

2004
01:59:46,120 --> 01:59:47,200
So if you're going to get the Phalanx,

2005
01:59:47,201 --> 01:59:48,340
you're going to lose if
you're going in front

2006
01:59:50,070 --> 01:59:54,940
to what cause then is it described that
the Roman armies are victorious and

2007
01:59:54,941 --> 01:59:58,900
those defeated that employed the Phalanx.

2008
01:59:59,710 --> 02:00:01,900
So how was it that the Romans
were able to beat the failings?

2009
02:00:02,410 --> 02:00:05,740
This is the cause in war.

2010
02:00:06,220 --> 02:00:10,540
The Times and places of action
are various and indefinite,

2011
02:00:11,200 --> 02:00:16,200
but there is only one time and place one
fixed and determined manner of action

2012
02:00:17,021 --> 02:00:21,640
that is suited to the failings.
In the case of a general action.

2013
02:00:21,641 --> 02:00:26,530
If an enemy be forced to encounter with
the failings in the very time and place,

2014
02:00:26,531 --> 02:00:27,880
which the latter requires,

2015
02:00:28,240 --> 02:00:33,240
it is probable in the highest degree
that the failings must obtain victory.

2016
02:00:34,810 --> 02:00:38,950
So if you fight the Phalanx where
the Phalanx wants you to fight it,

2017
02:00:39,580 --> 02:00:42,790
meaning on a big open area,
you're going to lose.

2018
02:00:44,230 --> 02:00:49,120
But if it is possible to avoid an
engagement in such circumstances,

2019
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:51,430
and it is indeed easy to do it,

2020
02:00:51,580 --> 02:00:54,280
there is nothing to be dreaded
from this order of battle.

2021
02:00:55,150 --> 02:00:56,980
And here's where it gets
to the nitty gritty.

2022
02:00:57,550 --> 02:01:01,990
It is well known and acknowledged truth
that the Phalanx requires a ground that

2023
02:01:01,991 --> 02:01:06,340
is plain and naked and free from
obstacles of every kind such as trenches,

2024
02:01:06,341 --> 02:01:10,390
breaks and browse of hills
or the channels of rivers,

2025
02:01:10,391 --> 02:01:14,960
and that any of these are sufficient to
impede it and to dissolve it the unto

2026
02:01:15,010 --> 02:01:17,110
dissolve the order in which it was formed.

2027
02:01:18,670 --> 02:01:23,670
If the enemy coming down down on it should
lead their army through the country,

2028
02:01:23,860 --> 02:01:27,010
plundering the cities in
ravaging the lands of what use,

2029
02:01:27,011 --> 02:01:28,290
then we'll be the Phalanx.

2030
02:01:28,290 --> 02:01:30,190
So all you have to do is get
them on some rough terrain.

2031
02:01:31,060 --> 02:01:33,810
You get them on some rough terrain
and that Phalanx, I mean it's,

2032
02:01:33,820 --> 02:01:35,920
it's hard to march already.
We know that,

2033
02:01:35,921 --> 02:01:39,590
but now we're marching against weird
terrain and the guy in front of you trips

2034
02:01:39,591 --> 02:01:40,940
and falls while heat.
What does he hit?

2035
02:01:40,941 --> 02:01:43,760
He hits a rock and how that makes this
guy fall and all of a sudden we got a big

2036
02:01:44,150 --> 02:01:46,970
disaster on our hands back to the book.

2037
02:01:47,030 --> 02:01:49,190
When the Romans attacked
the failings in the front,

2038
02:01:49,191 --> 02:01:53,780
they never employ all their forces so as
to make their line equal to that of the

2039
02:01:53,781 --> 02:01:54,081
enemy,

2040
02:01:54,081 --> 02:01:59,081
but lead on only a part of their troops
and the rest they keep in reserve.

2041
02:02:00,530 --> 02:02:01,341
Now,
whether the troops,

2042
02:02:01,341 --> 02:02:04,730
the Phalanx break the line that is
opposed to them or whether they are broken

2043
02:02:04,731 --> 02:02:09,200
themselves, the formation peculiar
to the Phalanx is alike dissolved.

2044
02:02:09,201 --> 02:02:12,980
So even if they win
that initial onslaught,

2045
02:02:13,220 --> 02:02:16,940
even if the Phalanx wins,
that the Phalanx is out of order.

2046
02:02:17,400 --> 02:02:18,233
Hmm.

2047
02:02:19,640 --> 02:02:23,330
If they pursue the fugitive or if on the
other hand they retreat and our pursued,

2048
02:02:23,331 --> 02:02:28,331
in either case they're separated from
the rest of their own body and thus there

2049
02:02:28,401 --> 02:02:33,401
is left some space which the reserve of
the Roman army takes care to seize and

2050
02:02:33,741 --> 02:02:36,020
then charges the remaining
part of the Phalanx.

2051
02:02:36,350 --> 02:02:40,670
But the charge is not made against the
front but in the flank or the rear.

2052
02:02:42,050 --> 02:02:45,920
Since it is easy then to
avoid the conditions that
are favorable to the Phalanx

2053
02:02:46,100 --> 02:02:48,590
and since those on the contrary
that are disadvantaged,

2054
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:51,830
disadvantageous to it
can never be avoided.

2055
02:02:51,980 --> 02:02:56,120
It is certain that this difference alone
must carry with it a decisive wait in

2056
02:02:56,121 --> 02:03:00,920
time of action. So let them get a little
bit disrupted once they're disrupted,

2057
02:03:00,950 --> 02:03:01,783
flank them.

2058
02:03:01,890 --> 02:03:02,723
Hmm.

2059
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:08,730
The troops of the Phalanx lose all their
strength when they engage in separate

2060
02:03:08,731 --> 02:03:10,080
companies or man on man.

2061
02:03:10,620 --> 02:03:15,620
The Roman order on the contrary has never
attended even on such occasions with

2062
02:03:15,811 --> 02:03:18,090
any disadvantage among the Romans.

2063
02:03:18,150 --> 02:03:23,150
Every single soldier when he is once
armed and ready for service is a like

2064
02:03:23,311 --> 02:03:25,020
fitted and engaged,

2065
02:03:25,890 --> 02:03:30,810
fitted to engage in any time or place
on any appearance of the enemy and

2066
02:03:30,811 --> 02:03:34,800
preserves the always the same power
and the same capacity in action,

2067
02:03:35,010 --> 02:03:37,650
whether in separate
companies or man to man.

2068
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:44,700
So big destructive
element in front of you.

2069
02:03:45,330 --> 02:03:49,290
Don't go head on head with it.
We've learned this over and over again.

2070
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:51,360
You might want to distract it.
Sure,

2071
02:03:52,020 --> 02:03:56,970
but then you hit him from the flank
and don't face people on their best

2072
02:03:56,971 --> 02:03:59,790
category, right? Don't wrestle
against the rest of their,

2073
02:03:59,791 --> 02:04:02,520
don't you just threw against the Jujitsu
guy. Don't box against the boxer.

2074
02:04:03,270 --> 02:04:06,450
Don't go at them and don't do
it where they want to do it.

2075
02:04:07,740 --> 02:04:09,780
That's a real important,
disrupting the Phalanx.

2076
02:04:10,020 --> 02:04:10,853
[inaudible].

2077
02:04:14,300 --> 02:04:16,700
Now we talks about attacking
entrenchments, which again,

2078
02:04:16,701 --> 02:04:20,180
these are defensive positions.
When an entrenchment is to be attacked,

2079
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:24,530
an attempt should be made to extend the
lines as much as possible. Makes Sense,

2080
02:04:24,531 --> 02:04:25,430
right?
I just don't want to,

2081
02:04:25,431 --> 02:04:28,310
I want to let make the person think that
we're going to tack them on the whole,

2082
02:04:28,730 --> 02:04:29,930
the whole line that he's got.

2083
02:04:30,350 --> 02:04:35,120
This will make the enemy
fearful everywhere so that
he will not withdraw troops

2084
02:04:35,121 --> 02:04:38,010
from any point to reinforce
that what you intend to attack.

2085
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:42,180
Even after he discovers it, this makes
many of his troops. Uselessness was d day,

2086
02:04:42,570 --> 02:04:44,790
so what we did on d day,
you know,

2087
02:04:44,791 --> 02:04:48,090
they did those massive
deception operations. The Brits,

2088
02:04:48,091 --> 02:04:52,730
the Americans have built those fake tanks
and fake planes and put them all there.

2089
02:04:52,780 --> 02:04:56,190
They were inflatable. You've
seen that stuff right there.
You seeing that? Oh yeah.

2090
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:57,540
The Americans and the Brits.

2091
02:04:57,960 --> 02:05:02,960
When we were trying to to confuse Hitler
about where we were going to attack d

2092
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:07,860
day,
they made these,

2093
02:05:08,230 --> 02:05:12,180
we made like fake airplanes and fake
tanks and they put them in different

2094
02:05:12,181 --> 02:05:15,680
locations that indicated that we'd
probably be attack in this spot instead of

2095
02:05:15,690 --> 02:05:19,590
that spot and it all works and so
he had to defend the whole line.

2096
02:05:19,591 --> 02:05:21,270
He actually defended those
areas where they fought.

2097
02:05:21,271 --> 02:05:24,340
The attack was coming more than they
defended the area or d day was cool.

2098
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:27,050
Little deception operation.
No.

2099
02:05:30,510 --> 02:05:31,343
Okay.

2100
02:05:31,500 --> 02:05:35,130
Back to the book. Too much attention
cannot be paid, despise and guides.

2101
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:40,260
They are like eyes and are equally
necessary to a gen general.

2102
02:05:40,580 --> 02:05:45,570
He is uh, too much money cannot
be spent to get good ones.

2103
02:05:46,140 --> 02:05:49,230
These men should be chosen in the
country where the war is being fought.

2104
02:05:49,231 --> 02:05:51,060
They should be intelligent.
Cloning and discreet

2105
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:55,240
spies.

2106
02:05:58,400 --> 02:05:59,233
Okay.

2107
02:05:59,410 --> 02:06:03,430
The commanding general, I have formed
a picture of a commanding general,

2108
02:06:04,270 --> 02:06:08,560
which is not CIM miracle.
I have seen such men.

2109
02:06:09,070 --> 02:06:12,970
The first qualities, the first of all
qualities is courage. Without this,

2110
02:06:12,971 --> 02:06:16,060
the others are of little value
since they cannot be used.

2111
02:06:16,570 --> 02:06:18,220
The second is intelligence,

2112
02:06:18,460 --> 02:06:21,880
which must be strong and
fertile in expedience.

2113
02:06:22,570 --> 02:06:24,280
The third is health.

2114
02:06:25,300 --> 02:06:30,300
He should possess a talent for
sudden and appropriate improvisation.

2115
02:06:30,940 --> 02:06:31,773
That's a good,

2116
02:06:31,990 --> 02:06:36,990
you don't expect that a talent for sudden
and appropriate improv improvisation.

2117
02:06:38,200 --> 02:06:39,160
If I didn't make this clear enough,

2118
02:06:39,161 --> 02:06:43,390
he's kind of going through the
characteristics that he believes a good

2119
02:06:43,391 --> 02:06:44,920
commanding general should have.

2120
02:06:45,940 --> 02:06:49,960
He should be able to penetrate the
minds of other men while remaining

2121
02:06:49,961 --> 02:06:52,090
impenetrable himself.

2122
02:06:54,130 --> 02:06:59,110
He should be endowed with a capacity of
being prepared for everything with the

2123
02:06:59,111 --> 02:07:01,690
activity, with activity,
companied by judgment,

2124
02:07:03,130 --> 02:07:08,130
with the skill to make proper decision
on all occasions and with exactness of

2125
02:07:08,441 --> 02:07:12,460
discernment,
good lists.

2126
02:07:13,600 --> 02:07:18,400
He should have a good disposition,
free from from caprice,

2127
02:07:18,790 --> 02:07:22,780
and be a stranger to hatred and caprices
like you're just going to change your

2128
02:07:22,781 --> 02:07:27,460
mind all the time.
He should punish without mercy,

2129
02:07:28,450 --> 02:07:32,770
especially those core dearest to him,
but never from anger.

2130
02:07:33,910 --> 02:07:34,743
Okay.

2131
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:39,070
You remember earlier he was talking
about be kind of chill with it,

2132
02:07:39,130 --> 02:07:42,700
with the lashings, but he says
you should punish without mercy,

2133
02:07:42,701 --> 02:07:44,830
especially those who are dearest to you.

2134
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:47,950
And I think that goes to what you
were saying about troops. Hey,

2135
02:07:47,951 --> 02:07:48,850
you're going to draft people.

2136
02:07:48,851 --> 02:07:50,960
You've got to make sure you
draft the rich people too.

2137
02:07:51,570 --> 02:07:55,480
And I think you saying you've got to treat
people fairly, right, even when you're,

2138
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:57,420
even when it's in your voice.
Yeah.

2139
02:07:58,780 --> 02:08:03,780
He should always be grieved when he is
forced to execute the military rules and

2140
02:08:04,901 --> 02:08:09,901
should have the example of moneyless
constantly before his eyes and Manlius

2141
02:08:14,270 --> 02:08:19,270
actually actually Manlius he
was like a Roman a hero during,

2142
02:08:21,640 --> 02:08:26,200
during the Golic siege and he,
but beyond that,

2143
02:08:26,201 --> 02:08:29,860
he was sort of like a,
I want to call my human rights advocate,

2144
02:08:29,950 --> 02:08:32,650
but maybe that's too strong of a word.
But anyways,

2145
02:08:32,651 --> 02:08:35,950
he ended up getting a crucified,
not crucified, thrown from him,

2146
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:37,780
okay.

2147
02:08:37,780 --> 02:08:40,330
From, from a great height
and killed as Zach execution.

2148
02:08:40,810 --> 02:08:42,940
But he's sort of seen
as a guy that stood up.

2149
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:48,400
He almost was in like an Alamo scenario,
like in Texas when the, when they,

2150
02:08:48,460 --> 02:08:51,490
when they stood and were killed,
he was in one of those situations,

2151
02:08:51,491 --> 02:08:55,970
but he wasn't killed during that galaxy.
Jerome. Anyways, back to the book,

2152
02:08:55,971 --> 02:09:00,820
Kesha Discard the idea of that is he
who punishes and should persuade himself

2153
02:09:01,060 --> 02:09:05,140
and others that he only
administers the military laws

2154
02:09:06,630 --> 02:09:09,090
with these qualities,
you'll be loved.

2155
02:09:09,710 --> 02:09:14,710
He will be feared and without doubt
obeyed the functions of a general are

2156
02:09:15,900 --> 02:09:19,830
infinite. He must know how to subsist
his army. And how to husband it,

2157
02:09:20,130 --> 02:09:23,040
how to place it so that it will
not be forced upon to fight,

2158
02:09:23,041 --> 02:09:28,041
except when he chooses how to form
his troops in an infinity of different

2159
02:09:30,510 --> 02:09:33,090
infinity of different dispositions,

2160
02:09:33,660 --> 02:09:38,370
how to profit from that favorable moment
which occurs in all battles and which

2161
02:09:38,371 --> 02:09:39,900
decides their success.

2162
02:09:41,010 --> 02:09:46,010
All these things are of immense importance
and are as varied as the situations

2163
02:09:46,860 --> 02:09:48,840
and dispositions which produced them.

2164
02:09:50,890 --> 02:09:51,723
Yeah.

2165
02:09:51,940 --> 02:09:54,100
In order to see all these things,

2166
02:09:54,340 --> 02:09:57,580
the general should be occupied with
nothing else. The day of the battle,

2167
02:09:57,850 --> 02:10:01,540
the inspection of the terrain and the
disposition of his troops should be prompt

2168
02:10:01,720 --> 02:10:05,320
like the flight of an eagle.
This done,

2169
02:10:05,620 --> 02:10:10,620
his orders should be short
and simple as for instance,

2170
02:10:10,900 --> 02:10:12,070
the first line of attack,

2171
02:10:12,100 --> 02:10:15,760
the first line will attack and the second
will be in support. Boom. That's it.

2172
02:10:17,020 --> 02:10:17,853
Keep it simple.

2173
02:10:18,220 --> 02:10:23,220
The generals under his command must be
in competent indeed if they do not know

2174
02:10:23,381 --> 02:10:27,610
how to execute this order and to
perform the proper maneuvers with their

2175
02:10:27,730 --> 02:10:29,470
respective divisions.

2176
02:10:29,710 --> 02:10:34,710
Thus the commander in chief will not
be forced to occupy with it nor be

2177
02:10:35,301 --> 02:10:36,980
embarrassed with the details.

2178
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:42,760
For a fee temps to be a battle
sergeant and be everywhere himself.

2179
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:48,170
He will resemble the fly in the fable
that thought he was driving the coach

2180
02:10:50,700 --> 02:10:54,410
with us on the day of the battle.
I should want the general to do nothing.

2181
02:10:55,340 --> 02:10:57,110
His observations will be better for it.

2182
02:10:57,410 --> 02:11:02,410
His judgment will be more sane and he
will be in a better state to profit from

2183
02:11:02,721 --> 02:11:06,590
the situations in which the enemy
finds himself during the engagement.

2184
02:11:06,770 --> 02:11:10,550
And when he sees an occasion,
he should unleashes energies,

2185
02:11:10,610 --> 02:11:14,540
hasten to the critical point at top
speed sees the first troops available,

2186
02:11:14,541 --> 02:11:17,030
advanced them rapidly,
and lead them in person.

2187
02:11:18,230 --> 02:11:22,340
These are the strokes that decide
battles or and gain victories.

2188
02:11:23,030 --> 02:11:27,860
The important thing is to see the
opportunity and know how to use it.

2189
02:11:27,890 --> 02:11:29,920
So what are you saying? There's
got to be detached. Hmm.

2190
02:11:30,560 --> 02:11:33,030
He's saying you got to be detached and
then you've got to stay back or you've

2191
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:36,020
got to look around. Now he also says,
once you see the critical moment,

2192
02:11:36,021 --> 02:11:37,760
you've got to get up in
there and make it happen.

2193
02:11:40,750 --> 02:11:41,030
Okay?

2194
02:11:41,030 --> 02:11:43,850
But he's saying, you definitely
can't get laid down in the weeds.

2195
02:11:43,851 --> 02:11:48,640
You can't be the sergeant that's trying
to do everything back to the book.

2196
02:11:48,641 --> 02:11:51,730
Many commanding generals only spend
their time on the day of the battle and

2197
02:11:51,731 --> 02:11:55,360
making their troops march in a straight
line in seeing that they keep their

2198
02:11:55,361 --> 02:11:57,850
proper distances in answering questions,

2199
02:11:57,851 --> 02:12:02,440
which their aids the camp come to ask in
sending them hither and thither and in

2200
02:12:02,441 --> 02:12:06,280
running about incessantly themselves.
In short,

2201
02:12:06,430 --> 02:12:10,150
they try to do everything
and as a result do nothing.

2202
02:12:11,170 --> 02:12:14,980
So this is a great, this is just,
you're in a leadership position,

2203
02:12:15,010 --> 02:12:18,220
you try and do everything yourself.
You're not going to do anything at all.

2204
02:12:18,840 --> 02:12:20,860
Then it's the same. That's the same
thing as prioritized. Next, give me,

2205
02:12:20,861 --> 02:12:23,440
if you try and solve all the problems
that are happening at the same time,

2206
02:12:23,441 --> 02:12:25,310
you're not going to solve
any of those problems. Hmm.

2207
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:28,353
Yeah.

2208
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:33,520
They appear to me like men with their
heads turned who no longer see anything

2209
02:12:33,891 --> 02:12:37,280
and who are only able to do what
they have done all their lives,

2210
02:12:37,281 --> 02:12:41,270
which is to conduct troops methodically
under their orders up under the orders

2211
02:12:41,271 --> 02:12:43,700
of a commander.
How does this happen?

2212
02:12:43,970 --> 02:12:48,970
It is because very few men
occupy themselves with the
higher problems of war.

2213
02:12:49,610 --> 02:12:51,950
They pass their lives drilling troops,

2214
02:12:52,130 --> 02:12:56,390
and believe that this is the
only branch of the military act.

2215
02:12:57,680 --> 02:13:00,410
When they arrive at the command of armies,

2216
02:13:00,411 --> 02:13:05,411
they are totally ignorant and in
default of knowing what should be done,

2217
02:13:06,050 --> 02:13:08,390
they do what they know.

2218
02:13:10,730 --> 02:13:15,350
That is so classic. It's so
classic. When people don't know,

2219
02:13:15,351 --> 02:13:18,950
they don't understand something,
they do what they know how to do.

2220
02:13:19,170 --> 02:13:22,250
They they always default into
what they know how to do. Hmm.

2221
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:23,690
Their minds are closed.

2222
02:13:25,460 --> 02:13:27,530
One of the branches of the art of war,

2223
02:13:27,650 --> 02:13:32,650
that is to say drill and the method of
fighting is the other is intellectual for

2224
02:13:35,831 --> 02:13:38,590
the conduct of the ladder,
it is essential that ordinary,

2225
02:13:38,650 --> 02:13:40,420
ordinary men should not be chosen.

2226
02:13:41,680 --> 02:13:42,513
Okay.

2227
02:13:42,700 --> 02:13:44,960
Unless a man is born
with a talent for war,

2228
02:13:45,110 --> 02:13:49,910
you will never be on other than a mediocre
general is the same with all talents

2229
02:13:50,060 --> 02:13:52,640
in painting or music or in poetry.

2230
02:13:52,790 --> 02:13:55,880
The talent must be
inherent for excellence.

2231
02:13:56,510 --> 02:13:59,210
All sublime arts are
alike in this respect.

2232
02:13:59,480 --> 02:14:04,480
That is why we see so few outstanding
men in science centuries past without

2233
02:14:04,971 --> 02:14:09,200
producing one application rectifies ideas,

2234
02:14:09,470 --> 02:14:14,470
but does not furnish us soul
for that as the work of nature.

2235
02:14:15,140 --> 02:14:15,973
You know,

2236
02:14:17,450 --> 02:14:22,130
I just answered a question on Twitter.
I think it was,

2237
02:14:22,940 --> 02:14:26,750
um, and I basically said, well, you know,

2238
02:14:26,751 --> 02:14:28,130
you can't do whatever you want.

2239
02:14:29,260 --> 02:14:29,640
Okay.

2240
02:14:29,640 --> 02:14:33,440
Just because you believe in it and you
have hard work and discipline like that,

2241
02:14:33,510 --> 02:14:36,570
that doesn't mean you can do whatever
you want like as a career or something.

2242
02:14:36,930 --> 02:14:41,760
Yeah. Like, and I always use the example
like I couldn't be on the Olympic,

2243
02:14:42,660 --> 02:14:44,910
let's say an Olympic weightlifter or the,
in fact,

2244
02:14:45,060 --> 02:14:49,200
I don't know that there's any
Olympic sport that I would
be, that I have the, um,

2245
02:14:50,220 --> 02:14:53,510
genetic makeup to be able to,

2246
02:14:53,670 --> 02:14:56,180
to be able to compete
at the Olympic level. I,

2247
02:14:56,181 --> 02:15:00,030
of course we could go back and
maybe that's possible from a child,

2248
02:15:00,900 --> 02:15:05,450
but I don't feel like it.
But even right now w you know,

2249
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:07,590
if you take that to the extreme,
that means, hey, you know what?

2250
02:15:07,591 --> 02:15:09,510
If I have the focus and I have five,
the discipline,

2251
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:13,230
I can become an Olympic wrestler now.
High Jumper,

2252
02:15:13,680 --> 02:15:16,670
Olympic high jumper, right.
How's that vert looking?

2253
02:15:18,600 --> 02:15:21,510
So you see what I'm
saying now my opinion is

2254
02:15:23,610 --> 02:15:24,443
that is not true.

2255
02:15:25,200 --> 02:15:29,730
And some people are not going to achieve
certain things that they may want to

2256
02:15:29,731 --> 02:15:32,940
achieve no matter how hard they
want to do it. And I, you know,

2257
02:15:32,970 --> 02:15:35,610
most people are like, yeah,
that's a realistic. Some
people were like, no, you can,

2258
02:15:35,760 --> 02:15:39,960
if you believe that you can achieve it.
It's like if I could believe it,

2259
02:15:41,310 --> 02:15:46,200
if I could achieve it because I believed
it, dude, I'd be like, I'd be, I'd be,

2260
02:15:46,300 --> 02:15:49,630
I'll just all winning.
Sure. Everything. Sure.

2261
02:15:50,580 --> 02:15:54,720
It's not that easy. Yeah, you got to
believe it. You got to work hard at it.

2262
02:15:54,750 --> 02:15:58,590
You got to have some natural capabilities.
So the way it is,

2263
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:02,100
I'm sorry to let everyone down.
What was your line?

2264
02:16:02,280 --> 02:16:05,700
Is One of those lines that
you can kind of take with,

2265
02:16:05,701 --> 02:16:10,530
you said belief something odd.

2266
02:16:10,531 --> 02:16:12,480
Is it?
So you said it,

2267
02:16:12,510 --> 02:16:15,630
it belief is not going
to make anything happen,

2268
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:19,480
but at the same time without
belief, nothing's going to
happen. Totally true. Yeah.

2269
02:16:19,540 --> 02:16:22,440
Yeah. So yeah, you've
got absolutely. So yes,

2270
02:16:23,370 --> 02:16:26,940
belief by itself won't make
anything happen that, you know,

2271
02:16:26,970 --> 02:16:30,310
some people sit around, I believe I
can do this, so I'm going to achieve,

2272
02:16:30,440 --> 02:16:32,920
no, no, no. You want to achieve,
you've got to do something. Yeah.

2273
02:16:33,140 --> 02:16:36,520
And the same token that is also correct
is that if you don't believe in what

2274
02:16:36,521 --> 02:16:38,170
you're doing, then yeah, there's
no way you're going to achieve it.

2275
02:16:38,830 --> 02:16:41,320
You won't be able to gut through
it when it gets problematic,

2276
02:16:41,680 --> 02:16:46,500
which it's certainly going to,
so sacs agrees with me that hey,

2277
02:16:47,800 --> 02:16:52,450
the work of nature, it has to be in
play. Otherwise it's not happening.

2278
02:16:53,560 --> 02:16:57,250
You might get to some
level, but yeah, reality is

2279
02:16:58,010 --> 02:17:00,100
the thought.
I think that's a hard one to admit you.

2280
02:17:00,110 --> 02:17:02,990
You don't seem like you want to admit
this. I think you're over there like you.

2281
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:05,540
If you wanted to go the distance,
put it this way,

2282
02:17:06,100 --> 02:17:09,050
it seems really like that's not true.

2283
02:17:09,051 --> 02:17:11,260
It seems like you know,

2284
02:17:11,270 --> 02:17:14,690
you maybe you just didn't work hard
enough even though you thought that you

2285
02:17:14,691 --> 02:17:18,170
worked as hard as he possibly can and
maybe the fact that this is what it seems

2286
02:17:18,171 --> 02:17:21,670
like, but at the end of the day,
I do agree with that. I mean it's,

2287
02:17:21,671 --> 02:17:23,960
it's way clear with physical stuff.

2288
02:17:24,260 --> 02:17:27,610
Physical limitations are way
more obvious and there's, yeah,

2289
02:17:27,680 --> 02:17:32,570
there's, I don't know. Well,

2290
02:17:32,571 --> 02:17:33,230
let's face it.

2291
02:17:33,230 --> 02:17:37,340
Let's say playing guitar because I
play guitar and I also now kind of play

2292
02:17:37,341 --> 02:17:41,180
Ukulele. Yeah, but let's
say playing guitar,

2293
02:17:42,800 --> 02:17:45,860
even if you practice and you
can mechanically play guitar,

2294
02:17:45,950 --> 02:17:50,950
that doesn't give you the natural
spark of creativity that is demanded.

2295
02:17:51,500 --> 02:17:52,670
If it did,

2296
02:17:52,970 --> 02:17:56,450
then every person that worked hard and
play guitar would become a rock and roll

2297
02:17:56,451 --> 02:17:59,390
star with great creative songs,
but it just doesn't happen. Yeah.

2298
02:17:59,480 --> 02:18:02,930
There's hundreds of
thousands just in America.

2299
02:18:02,931 --> 02:18:05,210
There's hundreds of thousands
of people that play guitar.

2300
02:18:05,420 --> 02:18:10,160
At a incredibly capable proficiency.

2301
02:18:10,220 --> 02:18:12,680
Right? They can play every song
that you hear on the radio,

2302
02:18:12,830 --> 02:18:16,130
but you know what they do for
a living cover cover songs.

2303
02:18:16,340 --> 02:18:17,270
Will they play cover songs?

2304
02:18:17,271 --> 02:18:20,390
They're also working as a banker somewhere
because they didn't have whatever

2305
02:18:20,391 --> 02:18:24,890
creative thing that would give them to
be able to create something that was new

2306
02:18:24,891 --> 02:18:27,450
in that people want and
ruin and listen to that,

2307
02:18:27,451 --> 02:18:31,760
that needs to come from somewhere else
in practice isn't gonna get you there.

2308
02:18:31,910 --> 02:18:35,090
Some people learn it in the schools,
some people learn it on the streets,

2309
02:18:35,300 --> 02:18:37,790
but I think you kinda
gotta be born with it, man.

2310
02:18:37,791 --> 02:18:39,620
And that's a little
tenacious d for everyone.

2311
02:18:41,540 --> 02:18:44,650
Yeah. Yeah. And again,

2312
02:18:45,820 --> 02:18:50,810
like can you teach creativity?
And even then it's like,
yeah, but now, yeah, really.

2313
02:18:50,811 --> 02:18:55,150
Exactly. I mean, compared to the diagnosis
and then where do you get it really?

2314
02:18:55,151 --> 02:18:57,640
You know, it's uh, yeah,
it's weird. It's just,

2315
02:18:57,910 --> 02:19:01,240
I think that's really the reason that
it is true is because you can't put your

2316
02:19:01,241 --> 02:19:05,620
finger on it. You can't be
like, yeah, just work as hard
as you possibly can. Sure.

2317
02:19:05,621 --> 02:19:07,300
That's going to improve your other

2318
02:19:07,300 --> 02:19:10,420
classic example is look at the people.

2319
02:19:10,830 --> 02:19:12,730
You know what if I go to an academic,

2320
02:19:12,731 --> 02:19:17,200
a high level academic
environment where everyone is,

2321
02:19:17,560 --> 02:19:19,720
you know,
incredibly intelligent,

2322
02:19:20,410 --> 02:19:23,910
but not all of them are able
to do something that not all,

2323
02:19:23,911 --> 02:19:28,730
all of them are able to succeed
at the level that their,

2324
02:19:29,570 --> 02:19:34,520
that their heritage would point towards.

2325
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:39,500
So just because you got a 1600 on your
sats and you did this and you went to

2326
02:19:39,501 --> 02:19:40,490
this great college,

2327
02:19:41,130 --> 02:19:43,880
there's a lot of people that did
all those things and they're,

2328
02:19:44,150 --> 02:19:48,530
they're not what they themselves
would consider a successful. Right.

2329
02:19:49,100 --> 02:19:53,870
And so the reality is there's
something not there. And like you said,

2330
02:19:53,871 --> 02:19:57,590
I don't know that you can actually put
your finger on it because there's some

2331
02:19:57,591 --> 02:20:02,591
other kid that didn't do any of that
and made stuff happen and was extremely

2332
02:20:04,911 --> 02:20:07,700
successful. There's thousands and
thousands of examples like that too.

2333
02:20:08,270 --> 02:20:12,560
So it's Kinda like when you compare it
like the proverbial person with all the

2334
02:20:12,561 --> 02:20:15,200
potential versus someone
with not that much potential.

2335
02:20:15,590 --> 02:20:19,430
And maybe the guy with the,
with Le less potential,

2336
02:20:19,670 --> 02:20:21,530
there'll be exceptions
where that guy made it.

2337
02:20:21,980 --> 02:20:25,670
And then there'll be obviously like all
these other scenarios where the guy with

2338
02:20:25,671 --> 02:20:28,420
the potential doesn't,
doesn't make it. So it's like,

2339
02:20:28,880 --> 02:20:31,510
all right know this guy's born with it.
What kind of,

2340
02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:35,090
let's take it to a new level, not
just making it, but actually being a,

2341
02:20:35,860 --> 02:20:38,240
the highest level for that person.

2342
02:20:38,330 --> 02:20:41,360
You got to have the talent
and you got to have the work.

2343
02:20:41,540 --> 02:20:45,560
You gotta do both tends
to be the case check.

2344
02:20:49,340 --> 02:20:50,780
And he says the same thing here.

2345
02:20:50,781 --> 02:20:53,990
I've seen very good colonels
become very bad generals.

2346
02:20:54,140 --> 02:20:56,990
I have known others who were
great takers of villages,

2347
02:20:56,991 --> 02:21:01,970
excellent for maneuvers within an
army, but who, outside of that,

2348
02:21:02,150 --> 02:21:06,590
we're not even able to lead a thousand
men in war who lost their heads

2349
02:21:06,591 --> 02:21:09,830
completely and now we're
unable to make a decision,

2350
02:21:10,910 --> 02:21:15,600
any decision. So he sees the
same thing. And, and you know,

2351
02:21:15,620 --> 02:21:17,930
I see that with business leaders,

2352
02:21:20,540 --> 02:21:21,980
the business leader
that you need to be the,

2353
02:21:22,010 --> 02:21:25,160
at the beginning of your business is not
the same business leader that you need

2354
02:21:25,161 --> 02:21:28,320
to be. Once your business is more
successful, you got to have this.

2355
02:21:28,340 --> 02:21:31,760
Some guys are good at street fighting,
right? They're good at street fighting.

2356
02:21:32,090 --> 02:21:36,020
They're not good at planning a war,
planning a campaign,

2357
02:21:36,560 --> 02:21:38,690
and so you might win as a company.

2358
02:21:38,720 --> 02:21:41,900
If you're a leader at the street
fighting level and you do good,

2359
02:21:41,901 --> 02:21:44,240
you scrap it out.
Then as you grow,

2360
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:49,340
if you don't transition mentally and
become a different kind of leader,

2361
02:21:49,610 --> 02:21:51,740
not a different person,
but a different kind of leader,

2362
02:21:52,130 --> 02:21:54,020
you may not be able to
win at the higher levels.

2363
02:21:54,620 --> 02:21:59,620
So that needs to get paid attention to
back to the book one should once and for

2364
02:22:01,431 --> 02:22:06,431
all established establish a standard
combat procedures which the troops as well

2365
02:22:06,531 --> 02:22:08,300
as the general who leads them.
No,

2366
02:22:11,260 --> 02:22:14,800
I'm not the first person to talk about
standard operating procedures at all.

2367
02:22:15,850 --> 02:22:20,410
These are general rules such as preserving
proper distances on the march when

2368
02:22:20,411 --> 02:22:24,190
charging to charge vigorously to fill
up intervals in the first line from the

2369
02:22:24,191 --> 02:22:25,980
second no instructions

2370
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:28,170
are required for this.
It is the a B,

2371
02:22:28,171 --> 02:22:32,550
c of the troops and nothing is
simpler standard operating procedures.

2372
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:40,520
He also says that the general should
preserve an unfettered mind and not occupy

2373
02:22:41,551 --> 02:22:43,230
himself with trifles.

2374
02:22:47,440 --> 02:22:52,440
I am convinced that a skillful general
could make war all his life without being

2375
02:22:53,410 --> 02:22:57,760
forced into one.
That's the old,

2376
02:22:58,090 --> 02:23:02,110
the real martial artist doesn't have
to fight the art of fighting without

2377
02:23:02,111 --> 02:23:03,740
fighting.
This

2378
02:23:05,770 --> 02:23:09,610
war can be made without
leaving anything to chance.

2379
02:23:10,300 --> 02:23:11,380
And this has,

2380
02:23:11,800 --> 02:23:16,800
and this is the highest point of
perfection and skill as a general,

2381
02:23:18,920 --> 02:23:23,920
so he now are there things
that are left to chance in war?

2382
02:23:24,470 --> 02:23:27,100
Yeah, there's a lot of things
that are left to chance and warp,

2383
02:23:27,101 --> 02:23:30,500
but can you mitigate a lot
of those? Yeah, absolutely.

2384
02:23:32,120 --> 02:23:34,040
Back to book.
The words of the proverb,

2385
02:23:34,960 --> 02:23:39,530
a bridge of gold should be made for
the enemy is followed religiously.

2386
02:23:40,160 --> 02:23:42,740
Meaning I'm going to give,
if the enemy wants to run,

2387
02:23:42,860 --> 02:23:46,430
I'm going to build them a bridge. A goal
to run on. No, not you want to run away.

2388
02:23:46,431 --> 02:23:50,150
That's great. Warren
is over. This is false.

2389
02:23:51,230 --> 02:23:52,220
On the contrary,

2390
02:23:52,250 --> 02:23:57,050
the pursuit should be pushed to the
limit and the retreat which had appeared

2391
02:23:57,170 --> 02:24:01,160
such a satisfactory solution
will be turned into a route.

2392
02:24:02,530 --> 02:24:07,530
A detachment of 10,000 men can
destroy an army of 100,000 in flight.

2393
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:11,930
Nothing inspires so much
terror or occasions.

2394
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:16,100
So much damage for everything is lost.

2395
02:24:16,910 --> 02:24:19,850
So he's saying, no, you don't let the
enemy get away when they're running.

2396
02:24:19,940 --> 02:24:21,830
That's when you destroy them completely.

2397
02:24:24,470 --> 02:24:28,760
This is not to say that it is necessary
to give yourself up totally to the

2398
02:24:28,761 --> 02:24:31,760
pursuit and fall the enemy
with all your forces,

2399
02:24:32,600 --> 02:24:37,600
but if the officer you have ordered
in pursuit prides himself upon the

2400
02:24:37,971 --> 02:24:42,971
regularity of his formation and
the precautions of his march,

2401
02:24:44,450 --> 02:24:48,140
there is no use in having sent him.
He must attack,

2402
02:24:48,500 --> 02:24:51,770
push and pursue without cease.

2403
02:24:52,490 --> 02:24:54,050
All maneuvers are good,

2404
02:24:54,051 --> 02:24:58,820
then it is only precautions
that are worthless.

2405
02:25:01,580 --> 02:25:02,600
A yeah.

2406
02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:08,200
And that right there kind of wraps up
the highlights of this book attack,

2407
02:25:12,350 --> 02:25:16,730
Push,
pursue without ceasing.

2408
02:25:17,960 --> 02:25:22,360
And I believe that is also
known as getting after it. It.

2409
02:25:23,530 --> 02:25:27,940
What's interesting is I think it's
clear that as we continue to see these

2410
02:25:28,090 --> 02:25:33,090
leaders throughout history that we're
able to lead through the harshest of

2411
02:25:33,101 --> 02:25:33,934
conditions.

2412
02:25:34,660 --> 02:25:39,540
There's obviously a lot of common
principles that they share in.

2413
02:25:39,550 --> 02:25:41,680
So the question is, okay, why
do we keep breeding them? Hmm,

2414
02:25:42,910 --> 02:25:45,340
why do I keep trying to
confirm the same things?

2415
02:25:45,341 --> 02:25:50,320
Why am I always looking
actually for counterpoints
as well that offers some kind

2416
02:25:50,321 --> 02:25:53,260
of different solution?
Like the one about Sun Tzu today,

2417
02:25:53,290 --> 02:25:54,930
no need to be early on the battlefield.

2418
02:25:54,950 --> 02:25:58,210
If it's cold out there and it's going
to wear down your troops don't be early.

2419
02:25:58,590 --> 02:25:59,423
Hmm.

2420
02:26:00,580 --> 02:26:05,050
But from my perspective,
the more different angles
that you see these things,

2421
02:26:05,051 --> 02:26:08,830
the scene, the, the, the more different
ways that you learn the same lesson,

2422
02:26:09,640 --> 02:26:13,990
the more clearly you understand if you
learn an arm lock from three different

2423
02:26:13,991 --> 02:26:16,000
people, they're all going to
give you something different.

2424
02:26:16,001 --> 02:26:16,930
And it's the same thing.

2425
02:26:16,931 --> 02:26:21,931
We get something slightly different
from all these strategic thinkers.

2426
02:26:23,500 --> 02:26:24,040
Yeah.

2427
02:26:24,040 --> 02:26:26,470
And we get better understanding of it.

2428
02:26:28,540 --> 02:26:32,590
And there are differences
in what people say.

2429
02:26:33,910 --> 02:26:34,630
Okay.

2430
02:26:34,630 --> 02:26:39,630
And I think it's good to look at the way
those differences manifest themselves

2431
02:26:40,511 --> 02:26:42,490
on the battlefield and throughout history,

2432
02:26:42,491 --> 02:26:45,610
because maybe there's one solution that's
a little bit better than the one that

2433
02:26:45,611 --> 02:26:49,330
I know right now.
So for me,

2434
02:26:51,450 --> 02:26:53,940
I'm going to continually try to reinforce,

2435
02:26:54,980 --> 02:26:56,520
try and fortify,

2436
02:26:56,820 --> 02:27:01,620
try and stay humble as sacs talked about,

2437
02:27:02,250 --> 02:27:05,670
continue to learn and relearn
and discard what doesn't work.

2438
02:27:05,671 --> 02:27:09,420
And always try and get better.

2439
02:27:11,060 --> 02:27:11,893
Okay.

2440
02:27:12,050 --> 02:27:15,520
And I think that's all
I've got for tonight.

2441
02:27:18,160 --> 02:27:22,180
Yeah, I guess it better be. I thought
this was going to be a quick episode.

2442
02:27:23,140 --> 02:27:28,060
All good. All right. I guess we should
move quickly now. What do you think?

2443
02:27:28,360 --> 02:27:32,110
Do you agree with me or no, it doesn't
sound like it. We'll see what up.

2444
02:27:32,860 --> 02:27:35,020
So getting better.
Yeah.

2445
02:27:35,230 --> 02:27:40,090
Speaking of getting better duck wisdom
supplements, they're Jocko supplements.

2446
02:27:40,120 --> 02:27:45,040
We know you're going to get
better. And I, there's the case,

2447
02:27:45,100 --> 02:27:48,190
so Super Krill,
the Krill oil supplements,

2448
02:27:48,430 --> 02:27:52,540
good one super and joint
warfare and disciplined castle.

2449
02:27:52,780 --> 02:27:53,920
Let's say those three songs.

2450
02:27:54,430 --> 02:27:57,580
If anyone's wondering if you're watching
on youtube and you're seeing me drink

2451
02:27:57,820 --> 02:28:00,550
two things,
I'll drinking two things.

2452
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:05,260
One of them is it a smart water bottle
and it is. I'm drinking discipline.

2453
02:28:06,370 --> 02:28:10,720
The other is in a Poland spring bottle
that I brought back from Maine to remind

2454
02:28:10,721 --> 02:28:13,630
me of Maine and I'm drinking
that one Jocko white tea.

2455
02:28:13,950 --> 02:28:16,560
So it was vital to be in
New York to put away, every,

2456
02:28:16,710 --> 02:28:20,560
all in the northeast will say,
yeah, yeah, but you won't get,

2457
02:28:20,590 --> 02:28:22,100
you won't find Poland spring out here.

2458
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:26,480
No, no. That's when he brought
it back. Just don't nonetheless.

2459
02:28:26,481 --> 02:28:31,481
So the Super Krill Krill oil
better than fish oil factually,

2460
02:28:32,330 --> 02:28:35,390
factually.
And then there's Jocko Super Krill,

2461
02:28:35,420 --> 02:28:39,800
which is better than regular Krill oil
factually. And then there's, there's,

2462
02:28:40,310 --> 02:28:44,930
there's people out there not taking
Krill oil and I'm not saying they should

2463
02:28:44,931 --> 02:28:49,490
take real oil. They should take krill
oil. That's not what I'm saying right now.

2464
02:28:50,030 --> 02:28:53,150
I am saying if I will argue,
I'll actually

2465
02:28:54,920 --> 02:28:57,170
pretty much guarantee pretty much,

2466
02:28:57,860 --> 02:28:59,550
I know that defeats the
purpose of a guarantee,

2467
02:28:59,560 --> 02:29:04,550
but I'll pretty much guarantee that
if someone's not taking Krill oil,

2468
02:29:04,580 --> 02:29:08,510
whether you Jocko crew horror or not and
they take krill oil, there'll be like,

2469
02:29:08,511 --> 02:29:10,880
Dang, I should have started
taking this krill oil before.

2470
02:29:10,940 --> 02:29:13,340
Is it like learning Jiu Jitsu when
you started you just, you go man,

2471
02:29:13,341 --> 02:29:17,000
I should have said I wish I started this
when I was 13 it's just like that on a

2472
02:29:17,001 --> 02:29:21,020
smaller level,
on a joint maintenance level,

2473
02:29:22,190 --> 02:29:27,190
joint warfare is what I'm
feeling is for me that's kind of,

2474
02:29:27,750 --> 02:29:31,700
it's new. Right. You know and I'm like
man I wish I can get this for a long wait.

2475
02:29:31,720 --> 02:29:35,060
The joint warfare. Yeah,
cause you can feel,

2476
02:29:35,061 --> 02:29:38,870
it's like you're getting maintenance. Well
you should've came up with it earlier.

2477
02:29:39,060 --> 02:29:41,490
I know, I know. Next time
that's what you're going to do.

2478
02:29:41,491 --> 02:29:44,000
You can come up with it earlier. That's
what I think you should do nonetheless,

2479
02:29:44,020 --> 02:29:46,210
there for your joints.
It's a good and we're all working out.

2480
02:29:46,220 --> 02:29:50,780
They were making something.
We're making a new product,

2481
02:29:50,900 --> 02:29:53,750
we'll say sure.
And it is

2482
02:29:54,620 --> 02:29:55,270
okay.

2483
02:29:55,270 --> 02:29:57,760
It's going to be good. You're
going to like it. It's, it's a,

2484
02:29:57,820 --> 02:30:02,680
it's a protein drink and it's going to be,

2485
02:30:02,681 --> 02:30:06,820
oh it's, I've had, we've done two
samplings given the ingredient.

2486
02:30:06,830 --> 02:30:11,020
So we give the ingredients
to the supplement factory,

2487
02:30:11,620 --> 02:30:16,620
they mix them and we've gone through
to the F two we've gone through two

2488
02:30:17,381 --> 02:30:22,240
iterations.
The first iteration I was like,

2489
02:30:22,270 --> 02:30:25,200
oh my God, this tastes
good. Wait, wait, what?

2490
02:30:25,490 --> 02:30:30,130
Talking pure taste or taste? The
first one I was like all this, this,

2491
02:30:30,131 --> 02:30:32,410
this tastes good.
Really good.

2492
02:30:32,650 --> 02:30:37,150
Like the kind where you think this is a
whole new thing, you know what I mean?

2493
02:30:37,240 --> 02:30:40,660
Wait.
Yeah cause yeah cause protein,

2494
02:30:40,661 --> 02:30:44,220
tea tastes like protein
powders. That crap. Yeah.

2495
02:30:44,560 --> 02:30:49,450
And that was one of the things we research
to figure out how we could make it

2496
02:30:49,451 --> 02:30:52,510
taste legit. Good. Where you were not,

2497
02:30:52,540 --> 02:30:57,160
you're holding your nose enforcement down
between the first sample that we got,

2498
02:30:57,550 --> 02:31:00,910
which I was in Maine when we tasted it.
We stood there with me,

2499
02:31:00,911 --> 02:31:04,840
Brian and Pete and we were
standing there and we,

2500
02:31:04,841 --> 02:31:08,380
we all mixed it up together and import
it into three separate cups. Sure.

2501
02:31:08,450 --> 02:31:12,130
Anne and everyone, when we
drank it, everyone's like
quiet for a second. They did.

2502
02:31:12,131 --> 02:31:14,320
It was, oh my God, look what time is it?

2503
02:31:14,740 --> 02:31:19,250
Well this one was meant chocolate and,
and,

2504
02:31:19,260 --> 02:31:24,260
and it's just really good and obviously
the protein and is awesome and we've got

2505
02:31:24,541 --> 02:31:28,980
some other things in it that are
going to make it more complete.

2506
02:31:29,490 --> 02:31:31,950
But yeah. And then I just
got the sec, but you know,

2507
02:31:31,951 --> 02:31:34,350
there was a couple of adjustments
that I wanted to make to the taste.

2508
02:31:34,351 --> 02:31:37,380
Just the pure taste. Yeah. So
we just made those adjustments.

2509
02:31:37,381 --> 02:31:41,610
I got the second iteration and it
tastes even better than the first one,

2510
02:31:41,611 --> 02:31:43,860
but I still,
I've sent them back for one more,

2511
02:31:43,890 --> 02:31:46,850
but hopefully to only be one more
iteration before we can start producing.

2512
02:31:46,880 --> 02:31:48,250
It's going not going to
come out for awhile. Uh,

2513
02:31:48,330 --> 02:31:51,240
it takes a long time to get
everything rolling. But yeah. Anyways,

2514
02:31:51,241 --> 02:31:53,940
we have that in the future.
That's interesting cause I don't,

2515
02:31:54,030 --> 02:31:55,600
I'm not into protein powder.

2516
02:31:56,300 --> 02:32:01,300
You will be there is this one I'm telling
you you will be moved for protein.

2517
02:32:02,910 --> 02:32:06,030
It'll be for like a dessert. It'll be
like someone saying they're not into.

2518
02:32:06,031 --> 02:32:08,310
This is going to be like someone
saying I'm not into ice cream.

2519
02:32:10,170 --> 02:32:13,350
That's how tasty it is.
Good. I guess we'll see.

2520
02:32:13,351 --> 02:32:18,330
I guess that's kind of the test in a way.
In a way to test. Well good. Nonetheless.

2521
02:32:18,331 --> 02:32:22,970
Krill oil, joint warfare and
discipline. Those are already out. Yup.

2522
02:32:23,340 --> 02:32:26,370
Doing work discipline tastes good too.
That's another thing.

2523
02:32:26,371 --> 02:32:29,310
You don't have to drink something that
tastes like crap just because it's

2524
02:32:29,311 --> 02:32:31,530
awesome for you.
You can do something that tastes good

2525
02:32:33,060 --> 02:32:36,300
and I'll tell you one thing I've noticed,
and I don't know if this is,

2526
02:32:36,390 --> 02:32:37,380
I don't know what this means,

2527
02:32:37,530 --> 02:32:41,340
but when I drink discipline
cause I work out in the morning,

2528
02:32:41,341 --> 02:32:44,760
as I say all the time, I don't do a pre
workout thing. It's not my thing. Right.

2529
02:32:44,900 --> 02:32:49,860
I work, I work out in the morning on an
empty stomach and there was this old rock

2530
02:32:49,861 --> 02:32:51,990
climber and I can't think
of his name right now,

2531
02:32:52,020 --> 02:32:55,260
one of the famous old rock climbers.
And he would,

2532
02:32:55,470 --> 02:32:57,750
I read an article one time
about him where he was,

2533
02:32:57,960 --> 02:33:02,640
he would climb while starving himself
and wearing a weight belt who was harder.

2534
02:33:02,670 --> 02:33:04,980
And I was like, yeah, but if do
that, I've done that all the time.

2535
02:33:05,010 --> 02:33:10,010
Don't ever since anyways the D if
you have some discipline the drink,

2536
02:33:12,270 --> 02:33:15,830
then you will feel like,

2537
02:33:15,870 --> 02:33:19,050
so when I got done working out maybe like
let's say, you know, I always say, oh,

2538
02:33:19,051 --> 02:33:24,051
I usually have some nuts around mixed
nuts just to kind of get in my gut a

2539
02:33:24,350 --> 02:33:28,380
little food. I've been, I've
been having some some, you know,

2540
02:33:28,400 --> 02:33:31,500
a couple handfuls of mixed nuts and then
having some discipline and I still feel

2541
02:33:31,501 --> 02:33:36,030
so light. Super good that then
I'm just firing through the day.

2542
02:33:36,031 --> 02:33:41,031
And so basically what I'm getting at is
this is I've been eating even cleaner

2543
02:33:42,360 --> 02:33:46,350
because I'm eating like I'm
eating basically right now.

2544
02:33:46,351 --> 02:33:50,520
I think I'm eating a once a day meeting,
discipline, drink, it's discipline.

2545
02:33:50,550 --> 02:33:54,930
And then I'm going once a
day with a good solid meal.

2546
02:33:55,500 --> 02:33:58,580
And then yeah, it's man, it's good.
It's good stuff and that's good.

2547
02:33:58,581 --> 02:34:01,470
And that works for you. It was working
good for it because I'll tell you why.

2548
02:34:01,471 --> 02:34:05,670
When I eat less, I feel better.
When I eat less, I feel better.

2549
02:34:05,880 --> 02:34:10,080
And so this is making me eat less
now. I'm not saying now, believe me,

2550
02:34:10,081 --> 02:34:14,820
when I eat dude, I get it on. That's how
I roll. When I eat, I get it on. And,

2551
02:34:14,850 --> 02:34:16,050
but this is just,
yeah,

2552
02:34:16,110 --> 02:34:21,110
it's nice to be able to get
to feel energized and sharp
mentally without getting

2553
02:34:22,151 --> 02:34:25,810
crazy. Um, think that,

2554
02:34:26,020 --> 02:34:29,200
cause you know that idea that when
you eat less than you feel better.

2555
02:34:29,410 --> 02:34:31,900
And I found that to be the case
and this is what I realized.

2556
02:34:31,901 --> 02:34:34,030
I found that to be the case only
sometimes. And I was thinking,

2557
02:34:34,031 --> 02:34:37,420
why is it like that?
Sometimes if I'm doing something like,

2558
02:34:37,780 --> 02:34:39,640
you know when we go to the
muster or something like that,

2559
02:34:39,641 --> 02:34:43,960
I'll for sure FTX I were doing
something all day and I wasn't eating.

2560
02:34:44,730 --> 02:34:46,480
Yes,
but if you eat,

2561
02:34:46,481 --> 02:34:50,920
it's kind of like your body goes into
this like kind of wrestled for sure.

2562
02:34:51,100 --> 02:34:53,450
But if you eat a little bit or like just,
you know,

2563
02:34:53,451 --> 02:34:55,450
just like going to stand at all,
it's time to eat. Oh, could we,

2564
02:34:55,451 --> 02:34:59,620
could we cruising now you in your body,

2565
02:34:59,621 --> 02:35:02,680
you're basically telling yourself
you're going into level seven,

2566
02:35:02,681 --> 02:35:05,560
echo cruisey recruiters
technically recover mode.

2567
02:35:06,220 --> 02:35:09,370
It's really kind of what it does and
that's really what it felt like. So yeah,

2568
02:35:09,371 --> 02:35:12,860
I found that that, yeah. So you probably
have a bunch of stuff to do. Oh,

2569
02:35:12,861 --> 02:35:17,620
all the time. But when I'm
for sure, when you're like,

2570
02:35:17,621 --> 02:35:20,940
when I'm doing a fast, I want
to be doing something. Yeah.

2571
02:35:20,990 --> 02:35:24,010
You sit around and think about
food yet horrible. You feel like?

2572
02:35:24,320 --> 02:35:27,640
Like when Charlie plumb was talking
about being at the Hanoi Hilton and he's

2573
02:35:27,641 --> 02:35:28,474
just thinking,

2574
02:35:28,510 --> 02:35:31,630
they were just literally sitting around
thinking about food all the time because

2575
02:35:31,631 --> 02:35:33,400
there wasn't even anything to do.
Yeah.

2576
02:35:34,030 --> 02:35:39,030
And eating food is actually a little
bit of a cure or relief from boredom.

2577
02:35:39,950 --> 02:35:43,800
You're, you know how when you're a kid
you're just bored. You look in the fridge,

2578
02:35:44,650 --> 02:35:48,080
you're not hungry, you're
bored. Yeah, exactly.

2579
02:35:48,400 --> 02:35:51,040
It's funny because right now I got my, you
know my, it's wrestling season. So the,

2580
02:35:51,130 --> 02:35:52,840
the weight cuts are on and they're not,

2581
02:35:53,020 --> 02:35:56,170
neither one of my kids that are
resting are cutting a bunch of weight.

2582
02:35:56,770 --> 02:35:58,920
But it means that you don't,
you're,

2583
02:35:58,930 --> 02:36:02,050
it means that there's times when you
don't eat for a day right. Thing.

2584
02:36:02,380 --> 02:36:06,820
So you get to see the effects of that.
And my daughter's like, oh, I feel,

2585
02:36:06,840 --> 02:36:10,130
she's like, yeah, I feel fine. She's
just to get hangry or nothing. Yeah.

2586
02:36:10,131 --> 02:36:14,620
She doesn't get hangry. I
warned my wife, I said, hey,

2587
02:36:14,621 --> 02:36:16,950
you need to watch out cause
it won't people cause you
when you're cutting weight

2588
02:36:16,960 --> 02:36:20,020
with fighters they're cutting much more
severe weight and they start getting in

2589
02:36:20,021 --> 02:36:24,070
bad moods. Oh fighters. They start
getting in bad moods cause they can't eat.

2590
02:36:24,310 --> 02:36:27,730
They get hangry. Yeah but neither one
of my kids are cutting that much weight.

2591
02:36:27,820 --> 02:36:30,210
They're just kind of maintaining
through the season. Dude,

2592
02:36:30,340 --> 02:36:34,210
I dunno if we talked about hangry like
that's a for real thing because this is

2593
02:36:34,211 --> 02:36:36,040
what it is. When you, when you,

2594
02:36:36,070 --> 02:36:41,070
I mean Bilat physiologically your
frontal cortex or the prefrontal frontal,

2595
02:36:41,200 --> 02:36:42,370
I dunno,
whatever the front of your brain,

2596
02:36:42,371 --> 02:36:46,240
the part that's a
scientist makes decisions.

2597
02:36:46,480 --> 02:36:51,130
Oh an empathy and like all these things
get compromised one year when you're,

2598
02:36:51,131 --> 02:36:54,620
what hungry. I'll come
on man. Listen to me

2599
02:36:56,630 --> 02:36:58,570
because I believe that if you,

2600
02:36:58,630 --> 02:37:03,630
if if he made all those things less
effective than we wouldn't be here as a

2601
02:37:04,151 --> 02:37:04,691
species.

2602
02:37:04,691 --> 02:37:08,290
Cause every time we got hungry in the
past we would have gotten all confused and

2603
02:37:08,291 --> 02:37:09,850
frustrated and we are going
to be able to duck hunt.

2604
02:37:10,120 --> 02:37:13,750
But the bottom line is the opposite,
I think is true. Back in the dairy,

2605
02:37:14,560 --> 02:37:17,900
if needed a hunt something down,
you had to be sharp.

2606
02:37:17,901 --> 02:37:21,080
So when you didn't eat it made you sharper
and more attuned. That's how I feel.

2607
02:37:21,290 --> 02:37:24,620
Okay. That's not what, you know
what I read and heard, but hey,

2608
02:37:24,621 --> 02:37:27,630
I'm not saying that word that you can
go on the Internet and find an r two

2609
02:37:27,670 --> 02:37:30,560
scientific articles that
say the exact opposite.

2610
02:37:30,680 --> 02:37:35,120
Just follow me.
So hangry from what I read.

2611
02:37:36,200 --> 02:37:40,370
Correct. Well, they didn't use
the word hangry, but empathy.

2612
02:37:40,670 --> 02:37:45,410
And this is with like if you get
hungry or I'm sleep deprived,

2613
02:37:46,010 --> 02:37:50,120
whatever. Yeah, just a part of your brain
kind of. It doesn't shut down completely.

2614
02:37:50,240 --> 02:37:54,890
It just yesterday,
yesterday I went to sleep.

2615
02:37:54,920 --> 02:37:56,340
I went to bed.
Sure.

2616
02:37:56,900 --> 02:38:00,190
Eight 30 at night. Hey, yeah,

2617
02:38:00,860 --> 02:38:04,920
I woke up at like three 50
and I was Kinda, I was like,
Dang, that felt good. Yeah,

2618
02:38:05,050 --> 02:38:08,780
I was, but I didn't sleep almost at all
the night before. So I was recovering.

2619
02:38:08,781 --> 02:38:12,360
I needed to put some more back in the
bank. And everyone says you can't do that.

2620
02:38:13,150 --> 02:38:15,980
You can't catch up on sleep. I just
did it. Yeah. I don't know. Just did

2621
02:38:17,650 --> 02:38:21,620
I caught up on sleep. I never let your
finisher, your scientific explanation.

2622
02:38:21,650 --> 02:38:25,730
So what was the deal?
It just pre frontal cortex or whatever

2623
02:38:25,810 --> 02:38:30,520
the um, so you know, you'll treat
people were technically, um,

2624
02:38:31,240 --> 02:38:33,240
so yeah, hangry. That's apparently

2625
02:38:33,380 --> 02:38:36,670
roof from what I read is, is it an actual
thing? Maybe not. So maybe I'm sure.

2626
02:38:36,690 --> 02:38:39,680
Aggression, aggression, maybe it does
make you sharpen when you're sharper,

2627
02:38:39,681 --> 02:38:41,240
you're not taking any crap from anybody,

2628
02:38:41,241 --> 02:38:43,430
so you're more aggressive towards them
because you want to go out and hunt and

2629
02:38:43,431 --> 02:38:47,510
kill something. Maybe. I do
agree with you. Weird Science.
Say Tomato. I say tomato.

2630
02:38:47,600 --> 02:38:49,630
You know, you'd be
aggressive, but nonetheless,

2631
02:38:49,890 --> 02:38:54,690
um, yeah, it's a real
thing apparently. Okay.

2632
02:38:54,960 --> 02:38:55,830
Who knows?
I don't know.

2633
02:38:55,831 --> 02:38:58,110
Not to say that everyone's going
to behave in a certain way.

2634
02:38:58,111 --> 02:39:00,480
I'm just saying that's what
happens internally. Maybe.

2635
02:39:00,540 --> 02:39:03,210
Maybe not nonetheless get disciplined.

2636
02:39:03,240 --> 02:39:07,650
It'll cognitively enhance lift your
prefrontal or frontal cortex. I forget.

2637
02:39:07,651 --> 02:39:07,981
We just,

2638
02:39:07,981 --> 02:39:11,940
both of them both though
Acre frontal thing in your
brain is shutting down. Boom.

2639
02:39:11,941 --> 02:39:15,180
Take that discipline. The cognitive
enhancers is going to help it out a lot.

2640
02:39:15,270 --> 02:39:17,160
Don't be hangry even if you're hungry.

2641
02:39:18,570 --> 02:39:22,740
Guess where you can get
these things@originmean.com
it's a lot of cool stuff on

2642
02:39:22,741 --> 02:39:25,110
there or Jen Maine also has geese.

2643
02:39:26,230 --> 02:39:26,880
Yeah,

2644
02:39:26,880 --> 02:39:30,570
rash guards, various clothing items all
made in America. That's a good spot.

2645
02:39:30,600 --> 02:39:33,210
Just check it out. Look on there.
It's a lot of cool stuff on there.

2646
02:39:33,211 --> 02:39:35,280
If you want something,
get something. Also,

2647
02:39:36,180 --> 02:39:41,180
if you're into workout equipment
to populate your home gym,

2648
02:39:43,740 --> 02:39:47,880
it's good having a home gym. By the way.
One of my friends is coming into town

2649
02:39:49,580 --> 02:39:51,590
and he's like, yeah, let's
catch a workout. I'm like,

2650
02:39:52,590 --> 02:39:54,440
we don't have to go to
a gym and catch work.

2651
02:39:54,441 --> 02:39:56,660
I work at at home to do something else.
Nonetheless,

2652
02:39:56,870 --> 02:39:59,870
it made me think of how good it is
to have a home gym. Nonetheless,

2653
02:39:59,930 --> 02:40:03,590
if you have your home gym,
you want to populate it even a little bit.

2654
02:40:03,680 --> 02:40:06,980
Get your workout stuff from on it.
That's what I think it's the cool one.

2655
02:40:07,280 --> 02:40:12,280
You can do various interesting
workout routines with the equipment.

2656
02:40:13,170 --> 02:40:15,130
Unlike Jocko Jocko,

2657
02:40:15,190 --> 02:40:18,540
his workouts are super boring.
Even though you do have kettle bells,

2658
02:40:18,541 --> 02:40:23,190
which I respect. Yeah, and anything you
want to add on that? No Man, that's it.

2659
02:40:23,370 --> 02:40:27,720
Are you sure if that was the workout?
The kettlebell, you're good, you're good,

2660
02:40:27,721 --> 02:40:31,620
you're solid and I'm sure you're getting
very strong and I'm sure you know in

2661
02:40:31,621 --> 02:40:34,830
case everyone doesn't know
and and running his mouth,

2662
02:40:34,860 --> 02:40:36,720
and I use that term like with,

2663
02:40:37,440 --> 02:40:41,070
I'm not just throwing it out there are
really was running my mouth and you're

2664
02:40:41,071 --> 02:40:44,850
really pissed off that you have a what?
How much is your heaviest? Kettlebells?

2665
02:40:44,880 --> 02:40:47,190
90 90 95 foot boom.

2666
02:40:47,370 --> 02:40:52,350
And my heaviest kettle bell was 88 pounds.

2667
02:40:52,860 --> 02:40:57,600
This is no longer a problem. Now
my heaviest kettle bells, plural,

2668
02:40:57,660 --> 02:41:02,660
because I have to do is 48 kilograms or
106 pounds commonly referred to as the

2669
02:41:06,121 --> 02:41:10,860
beast.
So nonetheless minor from audit.

2670
02:41:10,861 --> 02:41:14,400
They're the cool ones.
And you can get other cool exercise stuff.

2671
02:41:14,401 --> 02:41:17,700
They're still go on it.com/jocko
check all this stuff there.

2672
02:41:17,850 --> 02:41:20,460
Do you want to get something?
Also,

2673
02:41:20,670 --> 02:41:25,670
when you get your copy of reveries
on the art of war by Maurice,

2674
02:41:29,960 --> 02:41:34,720
it's a good one. I like those manual
kind ones. You know the one that goes,

2675
02:41:35,100 --> 02:41:36,720
I know is,
if you think about it,

2676
02:41:36,721 --> 02:41:41,010
there's really three types of
podcasts that are happening.

2677
02:41:41,070 --> 02:41:46,070
One is a to is manual
strategies about war.

2678
02:41:49,350 --> 02:41:53,130
Three is human nature inside war.

2679
02:41:53,670 --> 02:41:56,310
So those are kind of, when I'm
reading a book I'm like, Oh yeah,

2680
02:41:56,311 --> 02:41:57,930
I just kind of like one
of those. Yeah. Yeah.

2681
02:41:58,140 --> 02:42:01,710
So this would be with Napoleon's
maxims or something like that.

2682
02:42:01,711 --> 02:42:03,240
The Art of war by Sun Tzu.

2683
02:42:03,241 --> 02:42:08,241
So we've done quite a number of
books like that and you know,

2684
02:42:08,760 --> 02:42:12,450
I get a little something different from
each of them because if you think about

2685
02:42:12,451 --> 02:42:15,140
it, he says that you have to pay
attention to the human heart. Well,

2686
02:42:15,220 --> 02:42:16,330
where are you going to
learn about the human heart?

2687
02:42:16,331 --> 02:42:18,780
And he didn't say much about it. As much
as he said you need to know about it.

2688
02:42:18,781 --> 02:42:20,250
He didn't say much about it.
Where are you going to find it?

2689
02:42:20,630 --> 02:42:23,370
You're gonna find it by reading people
that were actually in war and start to

2690
02:42:23,371 --> 02:42:27,390
understand where their heart
was in this whole gig. Yeah.

2691
02:42:27,510 --> 02:42:32,510
It's interesting too because they're
laid out in these specific contexts,

2692
02:42:32,731 --> 02:42:37,360
you know, like, um, like Sun Tzu that
he's, he's talking about, you know,

2693
02:42:37,410 --> 02:42:39,510
a certain time period,
a certain place,

2694
02:42:39,600 --> 02:42:42,630
and then Vietnam one and then
a world war and they're still,

2695
02:42:42,631 --> 02:42:43,441
they're talking about,
okay,

2696
02:42:43,441 --> 02:42:46,770
these principles at this time
and this is why they work well,

2697
02:42:46,771 --> 02:42:51,771
it was interesting to do I drang and
how more because it was his battle to

2698
02:42:53,161 --> 02:42:56,580
podcasts on his battle and then his
book that he wrote about leadership.

2699
02:42:56,730 --> 02:42:59,090
So you kinda got to see maybe,
I don't know,

2700
02:42:59,091 --> 02:43:02,340
I don't know if there's anything now
we've seen some of that when for instance,

2701
02:43:02,430 --> 02:43:04,320
you got Napoleon's maxims,
right?

2702
02:43:04,620 --> 02:43:07,320
And then we got to hear from
a Napoleonic foot soldier.

2703
02:43:07,440 --> 02:43:12,010
So you get to kind of see, see
the, what the world was like,

2704
02:43:12,011 --> 02:43:14,200
what the human heart was,
was going on with the human heart,

2705
02:43:14,260 --> 02:43:19,060
and then what was going on with the minds
of the stratus Titian or even know if

2706
02:43:19,061 --> 02:43:22,540
that's a word. It's tragic.
Sure. I think so. Just be kicked.

2707
02:43:22,750 --> 02:43:27,700
You know what's cool is the
English language, you can
words vague, vague, vague.

2708
02:43:27,790 --> 02:43:31,090
They come about, you just get
formed. Yeah. That's a catch.

2709
02:43:31,091 --> 02:43:35,440
There's a time where there was no
word and that word is there yet.

2710
02:43:36,320 --> 02:43:39,550
If you look at the OED,
which is the Oxford English dictionary,

2711
02:43:40,480 --> 02:43:42,290
it tells you where the f w,

2712
02:43:42,360 --> 02:43:46,660
w word came from and then
it has like first usages.

2713
02:43:46,780 --> 02:43:47,613
So there's some words.

2714
02:43:47,620 --> 02:43:52,620
This word is this for this word was first
in print in 1622 in this work of art

2715
02:43:55,091 --> 02:44:00,010
or this work of literature.
Yeah. It's crazy to like words.

2716
02:44:00,011 --> 02:44:04,600
We'll go in these cycles where
there'll be used like eight, right?

2717
02:44:04,800 --> 02:44:07,360
If you say ain't, that's a
game. That's an improper thing.

2718
02:44:07,361 --> 02:44:11,890
It's not really a word level by ain't was
actually used by like high upper class

2719
02:44:11,891 --> 02:44:13,390
people back in the day,

2720
02:44:13,450 --> 02:44:18,450
like long time ago and like ain't and
Shan't and all these like words like I

2721
02:44:18,941 --> 02:44:20,920
Shit, you know, all this.
And eight was one of them.

2722
02:44:20,980 --> 02:44:23,320
There's one home and I forget the deal,

2723
02:44:23,321 --> 02:44:27,010
but someone in the lower class
started using it and they're like, oh,

2724
02:44:27,011 --> 02:44:30,820
they're using it now, or
something like that. So it
went out and now it's like, oh,

2725
02:44:30,821 --> 02:44:35,210
that's not a word that it is a word,
the ink, the language in general.

2726
02:44:35,210 --> 02:44:40,090
But definitely the English language.
I studied English in college and,

2727
02:44:40,240 --> 02:44:42,070
but the,
the classes that I took,

2728
02:44:42,130 --> 02:44:44,950
some of the classes that I took where I
would focus on that, which was pretty,

2729
02:44:45,070 --> 02:44:48,190
which is always very interesting to me.
Very interesting to me.

2730
02:44:48,340 --> 02:44:53,340
And I think the reasons it's interesting
to me is because language is how we

2731
02:44:53,531 --> 02:44:56,710
communicate.
Communication is how we lead.

2732
02:44:57,250 --> 02:45:02,250
So if you don't know what words you're
using or you can't find the right word to

2733
02:45:02,741 --> 02:45:04,720
articulate what it is
you're trying to say,

2734
02:45:05,020 --> 02:45:07,210
you're gonna have a harder time
getting your message across.

2735
02:45:07,480 --> 02:45:09,730
When you have a harder time
getting your message across,

2736
02:45:10,030 --> 02:45:12,420
it's harder for you to lead. Yeah. So,

2737
02:45:13,030 --> 02:45:15,310
and then if you kind of look
at the big picture of that,

2738
02:45:15,340 --> 02:45:16,480
it's kind of like you have been,

2739
02:45:16,510 --> 02:45:20,830
then you kind of in a way should know
slang and stuff like that. For sure,

2740
02:45:21,130 --> 02:45:24,580
for sure is if you're over here talking
to quote unquote all proper to people

2741
02:45:24,581 --> 02:45:26,950
who aren't used to hearing sure property,
they can be like,

2742
02:45:26,951 --> 02:45:29,650
what's this guy talking about? Or
whatever. That is definitely true.

2743
02:45:29,800 --> 02:45:33,010
And it's not just about language
there, it's about culture as well. And,

2744
02:45:33,070 --> 02:45:37,870
and you know, one of the cool things
that when I grew up and I was kind of,

2745
02:45:37,990 --> 02:45:41,530
you know, getting into the heart and
I was in the hardcore scene, right?

2746
02:45:41,920 --> 02:45:46,920
It exposed me to people and things
that I wouldn't have seen if I would've

2747
02:45:47,050 --> 02:45:51,580
stayed in my small, New England
town. So when I got to the world,

2748
02:45:52,780 --> 02:45:55,840
meaning got out of that small town
in an hour, I was in the military,

2749
02:45:56,050 --> 02:46:00,910
I was able to understand better
than I would have if I didn't.

2750
02:46:01,080 --> 02:46:05,820
Yeah. And I think that's important.
Yeah. Yeah, it helps for sure. You have,

2751
02:46:06,610 --> 02:46:10,640
okay. How's this word?
Irregardless. Right ear regardless.

2752
02:46:10,880 --> 02:46:14,060
It's not even a word, right. That's
what they said. So I had this bet,

2753
02:46:14,090 --> 02:46:15,950
this is a long time.
It was like over 10 years ago.

2754
02:46:16,400 --> 02:46:20,540
I just bet cause coworker of mine and I,
for whatever,

2755
02:46:20,541 --> 02:46:23,690
I think my dad taught me like, you're
a girl, this is not a work, you know,

2756
02:46:25,190 --> 02:46:28,100
and he'd always like correct to you so
you don't have any imprints in your mind.

2757
02:46:28,101 --> 02:46:32,090
Like someone uses the word irreguardless,
they should be corrected.

2758
02:46:32,091 --> 02:46:36,180
That was kind of imprinted in my
subconscious. So it happened at work,

2759
02:46:36,470 --> 02:46:41,060
Charles Grammar Nazis for a little
bit. It was more just, that was fun.

2760
02:46:41,090 --> 02:46:45,110
But nonetheless, he,
um, no, she was a girl,

2761
02:46:45,980 --> 02:46:50,180
I said in regardless and word
and she was like, yeah, it is.

2762
02:46:50,670 --> 02:46:55,230
I was like, no, Irregardless
is like a misuse, misuse of
a word. Is that regardless,

2763
02:46:55,260 --> 02:46:58,490
regardless, Irregardless is a misuse of
war. It's not a word. She was like, well,

2764
02:46:58,491 --> 02:47:00,950
if it's a, if it's a word,
if it's a misuse of a word,

2765
02:47:00,951 --> 02:47:04,310
it's the word for the misuse of
this specific word. And I'm like,

2766
02:47:04,311 --> 02:47:07,400
it's not a word that hell did
that just mean she's saying.

2767
02:47:07,580 --> 02:47:11,390
She's saying basically if you can say
it and you can spell it and it's like if

2768
02:47:11,391 --> 02:47:15,810
it's a little name for something,
it's not the name of anything.

2769
02:47:15,980 --> 02:47:19,840
Name for a misuse of a word is what?
That was her argument. That's what I,

2770
02:47:19,850 --> 02:47:23,420
that's what I was saying.
Did you win money? No, I did
not win the myself money. No.

2771
02:47:23,421 --> 02:47:27,410
So we're, we, it never got resolved
between me and her. We hated it.

2772
02:47:27,430 --> 02:47:29,920
I think we kind of hated each other.
I would cause it got heated.

2773
02:47:31,460 --> 02:47:33,890
We actually didn't hate each other.
It was cool. But nonetheless,

2774
02:47:33,891 --> 02:47:37,940
that was her stance.
My stance is you can't just invent a word.

2775
02:47:38,240 --> 02:47:42,080
You can't just use a word wrong,
invent another word because you're wrong.

2776
02:47:42,260 --> 02:47:44,540
And then be like, oh, now
it's a word, now I'm right.

2777
02:47:44,541 --> 02:47:47,000
All of a sudden you can't do
this. Not how it works. And then,

2778
02:47:47,001 --> 02:47:50,830
so I look it up in the dictionary. Yeah.
It was haunting me. So when I went over,

2779
02:47:50,831 --> 02:47:52,610
I looked it up in the diction.
Sure enough,

2780
02:47:52,611 --> 02:47:56,970
the thing was there and
it said the misuse of the,

2781
02:47:57,050 --> 02:48:00,920
or the common misuse of regardless.
So I'm, but I'm still confused.

2782
02:48:00,921 --> 02:48:04,970
Like is that a word? And here's the
thing, I talked to Jane about it. Yeah.

2783
02:48:04,971 --> 02:48:07,550
It bothered me a lot. Yeah. So I talked
to jade about it and he was like, Bro,

2784
02:48:07,551 --> 02:48:11,910
that's kind of how the language is
getting enough people misusing regardless,

2785
02:48:11,911 --> 02:48:13,010
saying Eric Irregardless list,
boom.

2786
02:48:13,011 --> 02:48:16,610
All of a sudden he gets shuffled right
into the rotation as a legitimate words.

2787
02:48:16,610 --> 02:48:19,940
What is that a good thing or is that
a bad day? It's a beautiful thing.

2788
02:48:21,080 --> 02:48:22,180
It's a beautiful thing.
It is.

2789
02:48:22,770 --> 02:48:26,630
Language is always evolving and that's
what allows the language. Just like,

2790
02:48:26,660 --> 02:48:30,500
just like Jujitsu, just like a mixed
martial arts. You want it to evolve.

2791
02:48:30,590 --> 02:48:35,390
You want it to new words to come out that
can articulate something a little bit

2792
02:48:35,420 --> 02:48:38,720
better. He's like, for instance,
it regardless articulates its,

2793
02:48:38,721 --> 02:48:43,580
you don't have the English
language very well, but, but yeah,

2794
02:48:43,640 --> 02:48:45,830
at some point a hundred
years in the future,

2795
02:48:46,070 --> 02:48:51,070
regardless will become a word that has
a little bit of a different meaning than

2796
02:48:51,291 --> 02:48:54,710
regardless.
Like it's maybe it's more regardless ear,

2797
02:48:54,800 --> 02:48:56,450
regardless of what you're saying.

2798
02:48:57,290 --> 02:49:00,590
And it will say first used in the,
you know,

2799
02:49:00,591 --> 02:49:04,420
somebody is gonna write an article
in online or, and it's going to,

2800
02:49:04,610 --> 02:49:05,690
the guy's going to misuse it,

2801
02:49:05,691 --> 02:49:08,340
but everyone's gonna understand it and
it's gonna say first used here. Yeah.

2802
02:49:09,030 --> 02:49:10,740
There's all kinds of arguments
you can have about language,

2803
02:49:10,741 --> 02:49:12,480
but you have to remember that
it's evolving all the time.

2804
02:49:12,481 --> 02:49:15,600
Our languages are evolving all
the time and it should, in France,

2805
02:49:15,601 --> 02:49:17,930
they try not to let their language evolve.
Yeah.

2806
02:49:18,250 --> 02:49:21,010
The try and keep that
language since you're seeing,

2807
02:49:21,050 --> 02:49:25,320
or the ultimate result is something
like that would be the word.

2808
02:49:25,321 --> 02:49:26,670
I think it's the same result.

2809
02:49:26,760 --> 02:49:31,760
If you try and not not
evolve your martial arts,

2810
02:49:32,220 --> 02:49:34,320
eventually, if you don't evolve your
martial arts, you're going to lose.

2811
02:49:35,250 --> 02:49:36,720
It's the same thing with language.
Yeah.

2812
02:49:36,721 --> 02:49:41,700
You become less effective communication
with in language as far as that goes.

2813
02:49:42,150 --> 02:49:45,270
The word literally now. Okay.
Literally, we know at Lahey,

2814
02:49:45,330 --> 02:49:47,340
here's the hard part about accepting this,

2815
02:49:47,341 --> 02:49:51,210
because literally means something very
specific. There's no ambiguousness.

2816
02:49:51,320 --> 02:49:53,970
If it started to be ambiguous,
you wouldn't say literally,

2817
02:49:54,240 --> 02:49:57,320
say figuratively or are, you just won't
say anything. That's what I did. That's,

2818
02:49:57,510 --> 02:50:01,530
that's the defining characteristic of the
word, literally. But here's the thing.

2819
02:50:01,950 --> 02:50:05,040
Now literally doesn't mean literally,

2820
02:50:05,280 --> 02:50:09,960
literally means just re almost a
lot. Oh yeah. Just really strong.

2821
02:50:09,961 --> 02:50:13,680
Not even, almost literally. It's just
really strong. So if I was like, man,

2822
02:50:13,980 --> 02:50:18,000
this guy joke was so funny.
I was literally dying, right?

2823
02:50:18,030 --> 02:50:20,520
I wasn't almost dying
is not what it means.

2824
02:50:20,521 --> 02:50:25,380
It just means it was super
duper duper funny. You know
what's changing? Yeah, man,

2825
02:50:25,890 --> 02:50:30,840
that's a hard one to accept. Like and
all. I think there's another word,

2826
02:50:30,870 --> 02:50:33,810
but in America, in California,
this is a recent one,

2827
02:50:34,200 --> 02:50:39,200
so maybe the 80 [inaudible]
everyone's to in order to say said,

2828
02:50:40,220 --> 02:50:44,250
said like, or all echo was
like, you gotta stop doing this.

2829
02:50:44,251 --> 02:50:45,900
And I was all no way
we're going to do that.

2830
02:50:45,901 --> 02:50:50,280
And that's just the way the language
of orals. Dang. That's cool. Hey Man,

2831
02:50:50,400 --> 02:50:54,090
I dig it.
It's all nonetheless fifth,

2832
02:50:54,120 --> 02:50:58,200
you want to buy this book regardless,

2833
02:50:58,340 --> 02:51:01,020
regardless of the language in it.
It don't do that.

2834
02:51:02,820 --> 02:51:07,230
What I did was I made it easy. You got
to Jocko podcast.com on the top menu,

2835
02:51:07,720 --> 02:51:11,130
whenever you put a page there,
has all the books by episode.

2836
02:51:11,131 --> 02:51:14,520
This one is on there along with
everything else. Just click through there.

2837
02:51:14,550 --> 02:51:16,350
It's a good way to support and you get,

2838
02:51:16,450 --> 02:51:19,620
you'd takes you to Amazon and
you get your book in eight hours,

2839
02:51:19,621 --> 02:51:23,100
however long it takes to ship to
your house. Good way to support.

2840
02:51:23,580 --> 02:51:25,080
Also if you're doing other shopping,

2841
02:51:25,230 --> 02:51:28,530
if you're going to buy that lawnmower
and leaf blower that you've been meaning

2842
02:51:28,531 --> 02:51:29,364
to buy.

2843
02:51:30,040 --> 02:51:30,510
Okay.

2844
02:51:30,510 --> 02:51:32,520
And the Reiki as well. Um, false.

2845
02:51:33,240 --> 02:51:36,270
I'm just saying you're in the wrong time
zone ever. Wrong time of year for that.

2846
02:51:36,870 --> 02:51:38,610
Wait, the rake? No,
it's about to be spring,

2847
02:51:38,611 --> 02:51:42,600
so you got another six months before you
need to get the rain gout and the lawn

2848
02:51:42,601 --> 02:51:47,400
blower. Yeah. That's one of the last
things that I bought the leaf blower.

2849
02:51:47,700 --> 02:51:51,630
Really? Yeah. Okay.
Long story nonetheless.

2850
02:51:52,560 --> 02:51:56,430
Duct tape. That's year round thing.
Duct tape and just carry on shopping.

2851
02:51:56,431 --> 02:51:59,220
Whatever you want to do. That's it.
That's what you do. Good way to spark.

2852
02:51:59,340 --> 02:52:03,960
Also subscribe to the podcast, iTunes,
stitcher, Google play, Spotify.

2853
02:52:06,010 --> 02:52:06,761
We're wherever else.

2854
02:52:06,761 --> 02:52:09,550
They have a podcast and the wherever
else you and listen to the podcast.

2855
02:52:09,730 --> 02:52:14,130
They have like new podcasts apps out
to, yeah, they all have them. Yeah,

2856
02:52:14,260 --> 02:52:18,660
and I dig it. So Hey, whatever you're
using to listen, so that's correct.

2857
02:52:19,240 --> 02:52:22,390
It's a good one. Seems obvious,
I guess on the listening part,

2858
02:52:22,391 --> 02:52:25,510
but youtube not so much. We have a
youtube channel. Subscribe to that too.

2859
02:52:25,511 --> 02:52:26,980
That's a good way to support if you want,

2860
02:52:27,440 --> 02:52:31,360
because some people not into youtube
who's gone into youtube, I don't know.

2861
02:52:31,361 --> 02:52:35,290
But you can also waste a bunch
of time on it. Yeah, yeah.

2862
02:52:35,291 --> 02:52:38,980
It's like just it's, yeah, it's like
the Internet in general. You know,

2863
02:52:39,040 --> 02:52:44,040
a lot of good stuff like your whole like
pursuit can be on the Internet and it

2864
02:52:45,101 --> 02:52:47,170
can be very beneficial at the same time.

2865
02:52:47,171 --> 02:52:51,490
Your whole pursuit can be in the internet
or you do, and it can be detriment.

2866
02:52:51,530 --> 02:52:54,040
Do you mean your pursuit? Like,
well, whatever you're trying to do,

2867
02:52:54,190 --> 02:52:57,930
going on the Internet, we'll
will basically make it so
like if you're trying to,

2868
02:52:57,940 --> 02:53:01,690
if you're trying to learn three
d modeling, go on the Internet,

2869
02:53:01,720 --> 02:53:03,010
you can learn three d modeling,

2870
02:53:03,011 --> 02:53:08,011
100% well not 100% but you can learn to
be a professional three d modeler on the

2871
02:53:08,621 --> 02:53:10,540
internet at the same time.

2872
02:53:10,541 --> 02:53:14,230
You get caught up watching some nonsense
and not even take one step towards

2873
02:53:14,231 --> 02:53:16,990
three d modeling. I spent what I'm saying,
it's the dichotomy of the Internet.

2874
02:53:17,380 --> 02:53:21,520
Youtube has the same dichotomy,
but if you subscribe to the Jocko podcast,

2875
02:53:21,521 --> 02:53:25,570
youtube channel, there's no
dichotomy there. All good. All good.

2876
02:53:25,571 --> 02:53:28,990
I don't have to send upside because it
has video version of the podcast is has

2877
02:53:28,991 --> 02:53:32,680
excerpts and it has various other
little videos. We'll just sort of add.

2878
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,770
I always say I'm going to add,
but this time I think I'm really an ad,

2879
02:53:36,880 --> 02:53:41,500
a different type of video. You'll see.
Let be good. Anyway, good way to support.

2880
02:53:41,740 --> 02:53:46,450
Also, Jack was a store, if
you didn't already know,
it's called Jacqueline store,

2881
02:53:46,660 --> 02:53:50,890
drugstore.com that's where you can get
the shirt that Jack was wearing right now.

2882
02:53:51,250 --> 02:53:54,010
Victory, MMA and fitness. You don't
even have to be a member of Vic Victor,

2883
02:53:54,011 --> 02:53:57,910
MMA in fitness. You if you have the
shirt, you're kind of a member. Yeah.

2884
02:53:57,970 --> 02:54:02,410
At least in spirit. You're a member
in, in w, yeah, in that sort of way.

2885
02:54:02,800 --> 02:54:03,633
Nonetheless,

2886
02:54:03,670 --> 02:54:08,470
it's on [inaudible] dot com is where you
can get any of the shirts that we make

2887
02:54:09,280 --> 02:54:14,280
and so we also have hoodies on there
and rash guards and hats and patches.

2888
02:54:16,020 --> 02:54:20,530
Let a good stuff. Kids, women's good
stuff. I'm not saying to go buy something.

2889
02:54:20,710 --> 02:54:24,790
I'm not saying that. I'm saying go
there. drugstore.com check out the stuff.

2890
02:54:24,791 --> 02:54:25,510
You want something,

2891
02:54:25,510 --> 02:54:30,510
get something and that's a good way
to support also psychological warfare.

2892
02:54:32,290 --> 02:54:33,910
If you didn't know what that is,
which I know you do,

2893
02:54:34,030 --> 02:54:38,860
but in the unlikely event of
you not knowing what that is,

2894
02:54:38,861 --> 02:54:42,160
this is what it is. It's an
album, not a music album.

2895
02:54:42,280 --> 02:54:47,280
It's a spoken word album with tracks Jocko
helping us through weak points of our

2896
02:54:49,870 --> 02:54:52,780
day. We points of our
campaign against weakness,

2897
02:54:52,781 --> 02:54:56,800
weak points of our struggle.
Struggle,

2898
02:54:57,250 --> 02:55:00,910
good struggles. Struggle for good. Sure.
Struggle for good. That's what it is.

2899
02:55:01,570 --> 02:55:03,980
You know the day you want to,
you want to sleep in or you want to

2900
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:06,890
cheat on the day, you
want to procrastinate, you
want to skip the workout.

2901
02:55:06,920 --> 02:55:09,950
That's the main one. That's
iconic one, skipping the workout.

2902
02:55:11,760 --> 02:55:16,250
Oh the rest of us are over here getting
leg day. I did legs the other day.

2903
02:55:16,520 --> 02:55:21,500
A good one. Didn't skip it. Psychological
warfare it. That's on iTunes.

2904
02:55:21,950 --> 02:55:24,680
It helps you through it. Yeah.
Some people they don't know,

2905
02:55:24,800 --> 02:55:28,910
so it's a Jocko on each track. Proud. I'm
telling you sometimes they like, wait,

2906
02:55:28,911 --> 02:55:29,121
what did,

2907
02:55:29,121 --> 02:55:32,000
I didn't hear the of this psychological
or they're not going to listen to the

2908
02:55:32,001 --> 02:55:34,960
rest of this podcast, but they will.
It only has like two minutes, three,

2909
02:55:34,970 --> 02:55:36,860
four like top 25 minutes left.

2910
02:55:37,430 --> 02:55:40,160
I'm just saying it's like
psychological warfare is good.

2911
02:55:40,760 --> 02:55:43,220
If you want Jocko to
help you just put it in.

2912
02:55:43,280 --> 02:55:46,110
That's how it originated me.

2913
02:55:46,460 --> 02:55:49,760
Not Skip workouts and get it on iTunes.
You can get on Amazon music.

2914
02:55:49,761 --> 02:55:54,680
You can get on Google play
and other podcasting, MP3

2915
02:55:56,330 --> 02:55:58,670
platforms providing platforms.

2916
02:56:00,740 --> 02:56:04,250
Also, if you're on Amazon, you can
get something called Jocko white tea.

2917
02:56:04,700 --> 02:56:09,620
If you don't want to have your dead lift
increased to a minimum of 8,000 pounds,

2918
02:56:09,621 --> 02:56:14,570
then don't get Jocko white tea.
You can get the books. Yeah.

2919
02:56:14,571 --> 02:56:17,630
The books that we covered on the podcast,
which are all listed on the website,

2920
02:56:17,900 --> 02:56:21,290
you can also get a couple of books
that you might want to check out.

2921
02:56:21,291 --> 02:56:25,730
One of them is called way of the war.
Your kid. I actually wrote that book,

2922
02:56:26,810 --> 02:56:31,310
teaches kids
to make their lives better,

2923
02:56:31,400 --> 02:56:36,400
to get on the path and work hard.

2924
02:56:36,890 --> 02:56:40,010
There's another book coming out. It's
actually available on Amazon right now.

2925
02:56:40,130 --> 02:56:42,140
Well, you can't get it yet,
but you can preorder it.

2926
02:56:43,070 --> 02:56:46,550
If you want to spread the
word, you preordered it. That
makes more people see it.

2927
02:56:46,551 --> 02:56:50,540
So that's cool. It's called way
of the warrior kid Mark's mission.

2928
02:56:51,670 --> 02:56:54,320
Nice little follow up to
weigh the warrior kid.

2929
02:56:54,620 --> 02:56:59,100
Different lessons to be learned
so you can check that off.

2930
02:56:59,101 --> 02:57:01,160
Do you want to check out
an actual warrior kid?

2931
02:57:01,640 --> 02:57:06,270
You can go and get some
Jockos soap from young Aden,

2932
02:57:06,860 --> 02:57:10,340
12 years old. No big deal.
You know what he's doing?

2933
02:57:10,670 --> 02:57:13,280
Making soap has his own business.

2934
02:57:14,360 --> 02:57:18,050
You can get that@irishoaksranch.com.
Like I said,

2935
02:57:18,051 --> 02:57:22,750
a 12 year old kid making goat
milk soap. You know why? You know,

2936
02:57:22,770 --> 02:57:25,520
why did that?
You can't sell goat milk in California,

2937
02:57:26,390 --> 02:57:29,690
but you can't sell goat soap
milk. So yeah, for sure.

2938
02:57:29,750 --> 02:57:32,450
So he wanted to make some good ones
so you can check that out as well.

2939
02:57:32,720 --> 02:57:37,640
The discipline equals freedom field
manual. It's about getting after it.

2940
02:57:37,700 --> 02:57:40,700
There's really nothing
more to say. Hmm. If you,

2941
02:57:41,750 --> 02:57:46,010
I've gotten a lot of great feedback from
that book so I appreciate it and once

2942
02:57:46,011 --> 02:57:51,011
you feel that you've gotten
what you can out of it,

2943
02:57:53,210 --> 02:57:57,710
loaned it to somebody so they can get on
the path to maybe they'll get their own

2944
02:57:57,770 --> 02:58:00,470
or get it for them,
whatever. It's your choice.

2945
02:58:02,640 --> 02:58:06,660
Important part of that. Everyone
wants the audio version of that book.

2946
02:58:06,690 --> 02:58:11,010
The discipline equals freedom
field manual is not on audible,

2947
02:58:11,370 --> 02:58:15,960
it's on iTunes, Amazon music, Google play,

2948
02:58:16,050 --> 02:58:17,490
other MP3 platforms.

2949
02:58:17,730 --> 02:58:22,680
And it also is an album that has tracks
the, some people say with tracks,

2950
02:58:23,220 --> 02:58:25,320
extreme ownership.
The new edition is out.

2951
02:58:25,380 --> 02:58:28,650
Thank you for helping us put the new
to new edition together cause we've got

2952
02:58:28,651 --> 02:58:31,140
questions from this podcast,
a new Ford,

2953
02:58:31,141 --> 02:58:35,730
but we've also got pictures or questioned
from the podcast in their extreme

2954
02:58:35,731 --> 02:58:37,260
ownership,
combat leadership,

2955
02:58:37,950 --> 02:58:42,180
how to get out there and [inaudible]
and a win for on site leadership

2956
02:58:42,181 --> 02:58:43,950
instruction and consulting.

2957
02:58:44,670 --> 02:58:47,910
You can bring our company Ashkelon
Front to your organization.

2958
02:58:48,690 --> 02:58:52,680
We solve problems through leadership.
Simple as that. You've got a problem.

2959
02:58:52,740 --> 02:58:55,830
The way you get the problem solved
is through leadership. It's me,

2960
02:58:55,890 --> 02:58:58,410
it's Leif Babin.
It's JP to know Dave Burke.

2961
02:58:58,500 --> 02:59:02,700
Email info national on front.com or
you can go through the website echelon

2962
02:59:02,701 --> 02:59:07,701
front.com there's also the muster
leadership seminar with the Echelon Front

2963
02:59:09,451 --> 02:59:12,510
team.
We're only doing two this year.

2964
02:59:12,511 --> 02:59:15,360
I'm going to try and get a bunch of
questions that I get asked all the time.

2965
02:59:15,420 --> 02:59:16,680
I'm going to try and get
rid of those questions.

2966
02:59:16,681 --> 02:59:19,230
Right now we're only doing
two musters this year.

2967
02:59:20,400 --> 02:59:22,740
We aren't going to New York City.
We aren't going to Texas.

2968
02:59:22,800 --> 02:59:26,010
We aren't going to Florida. We aren't
going to your hometown. I'm sorry.

2969
02:59:26,011 --> 02:59:29,310
We just can't. We can't go to every
town in America to do a monster.

2970
02:59:29,550 --> 02:59:32,880
We're only doing two of them this year.
We're doing one

2971
02:59:34,680 --> 02:59:37,200
in Washington DC, so there's an
east coast and the west coast.

2972
02:59:37,290 --> 02:59:38,760
One is in Washington DC.

2973
02:59:39,030 --> 02:59:44,010
It's May 17th and 18th we're doing
another one in San Francisco,

2974
02:59:44,100 --> 02:59:48,120
October 17th and 18th so if
you want to come to a monster,

2975
02:59:48,360 --> 02:59:51,510
you got to come to one of those two.
We're not going to Omaha,

2976
02:59:52,740 --> 02:59:55,170
we're not going to Milwaukee.
I want to go there,

2977
02:59:55,710 --> 02:59:58,650
but unfortunately we can't just
get to all those different places.

2978
02:59:59,340 --> 03:00:00,780
So apologize.

2979
03:00:00,810 --> 03:00:05,810
Thus far there has been for monsters
that we've done over the past,

2980
03:00:06,391 --> 03:00:08,760
a year and a half,
they all sold out.

2981
03:00:09,450 --> 03:00:11,700
These two monsters are
going to sell out as well.

2982
03:00:12,390 --> 03:00:17,390
So if you want to come and you want to
learn pragmatic leadership skills and

2983
03:00:17,581 --> 03:00:18,630
strategies,

2984
03:00:19,050 --> 03:00:22,590
then you can go to extreme
ownership.com and you can register.

2985
03:00:22,650 --> 03:00:23,880
We will see you there.

2986
03:00:24,630 --> 03:00:29,460
Echo Charles will also be there
and until you get to the monster,

2987
03:00:29,461 --> 03:00:33,540
if you have questions for us
or you have answers for us,

2988
03:00:33,600 --> 03:00:34,680
we're looking for both.

2989
03:00:34,950 --> 03:00:39,290
We're here and we are cruising
hard actually on the interwebs,

2990
03:00:39,330 --> 03:00:40,290
on Twitter,

2991
03:00:40,620 --> 03:00:45,620
Instagram and on Daffy Echo is at
echocharles and I am at Jocko Willink.

2992
03:00:50,671 --> 03:00:54,960
And finally thanks to those people out
there that make this podcast possible.

2993
03:00:54,961 --> 03:00:59,070
And by that I mean first and
foremost our military men,

2994
03:00:59,200 --> 03:01:00,160
women who

2995
03:01:00,160 --> 03:01:04,840
go into harm's way to protect
our freedom and our way of life.

2996
03:01:06,730 --> 03:01:11,730
Thanks to you and also to the police
out there holding the thin blue line.

2997
03:01:13,420 --> 03:01:18,370
Thanks for protecting us here on the home
front to the firefighters, paramedics,

2998
03:01:19,240 --> 03:01:21,220
and other first responders.

2999
03:01:22,030 --> 03:01:27,030
Thanks for being ready to come out
and rescue us anytime day or night.

3000
03:01:28,991 --> 03:01:33,100
And to everyone else that is listening.
Thank you for listening.

3001
03:01:33,250 --> 03:01:37,330
Thank you for sharing.
Thank you for supporting the podcast

3002
03:01:39,280 --> 03:01:43,390
because we appreciate, we appreciate
all that, but more important.

3003
03:01:43,391 --> 03:01:48,391
We appreciate going down
this path with all of you.

3004
03:01:50,110 --> 03:01:55,110
So keep putting one foot in front of
the other as you move down this path.

3005
03:01:57,581 --> 03:02:01,030
Keep making the decisions,
the right decisions,

3006
03:02:01,390 --> 03:02:06,160
even on the little things.
Keep attacking,

3007
03:02:06,580 --> 03:02:10,270
pushing,
pursuing without cece.

3008
03:02:12,550 --> 03:02:16,600
And most of all,
keep getting after it.

3009
03:02:18,720 --> 03:02:22,860
So until next time,
this is echo and Jocko

3010
03:02:24,150 --> 03:02:24,360
out.
