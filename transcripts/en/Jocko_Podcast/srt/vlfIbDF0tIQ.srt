1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,580
This is Jocko podcast number
99 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,550
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:14,400
It is a day for Q and. A. Let's
go right into it. All right,

4
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:18,720
let's do it Jocko. Hey Jocko. As the
director of our sales department,

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,620
I require my guys to fill out
sales call interaction logs.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,010
I have one guy who thinks
because the sales are up,

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,420
this no longer is important,
nor does he have the time.

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,360
How did you handle situations like this?
Okay, so as I got this question mark,

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,220
okay, I've answered this before,
I'm not going to answer it again.

10
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,190
I've gotten something close enough
and you know it's interesting,

11
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:44,700
I talked to some people now, I talked
to a lot of people and they say, hey,

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,030
you know on a Q and a, I know what
you're going to say. Yeah. You know,

13
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,160
and I'm like, Oh yeah, that's awesome.
They say, I still need to hear it. Sure.

14
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,130
But I know what you're going to say
and I should. Okay, cool. That's good.

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,150
That means, you know, people
are are starting to expand
their brain a little bit.

16
00:01:00,151 --> 00:01:02,940
Maybe. See a different perspective
that they might not have had before,

17
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:06,450
so that's good in my opinion right now.
Also,

18
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:09,720
what I realized is as you mentioned,
as I answered these questions,

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,220
there's additional information,
right? That comes out.

20
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,940
Once you make a certain
level of understanding,

21
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,570
then there's more understanding to be
had and so that's what I realized with

22
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:25,080
this question as I thought, well, okay,
there's the standard answer, right?

23
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:27,720
The standard answer is okay that you got
people in there not doing what you want

24
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,060
them to do and what do you do then?
Well,

25
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,230
the fact is the real standard answer
that everybody now knows if you've been

26
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:37,020
listening to podcasts is they need to
know why they're doing what they're doing.

27
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,490
They need to know why it's important.

28
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:43,230
They need to know how them filling out
those forms will help the company and

29
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,320
therefore help the individual that needs
to fill out the forms because it'll

30
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,340
provide better intel with to the company
that will provide them more accurate

31
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:56,430
advertising, which will in turn
make them be able to sell more,

32
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:59,700
which will in turn make the
cost to produce the product.

33
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:04,701
Go down because they're selling more
and that means he has better pricing to

34
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:07,150
sell things with and he'll be able
to sell more and make more money.

35
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,940
And so you have to tie
that whole thread through.

36
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,000
That's kind of the standard answer,
which everybody should know.

37
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,220
If someone's not doing
what you want them to do,

38
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,130
you need to make sure they understand why
they need to do it, why it's important,

39
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:21,090
how it ties back to them. Okay, so boom,
we get done with that standard answer.

40
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,960
Now there's the next level.
Right now we're going to purple belt

41
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,180
and,
and here's the nonstandard answer.

42
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:33,750
Here's the advanced dancer with a
purple belt. The answer is, okay,

43
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,710
now let's ask yourself this piece of
paper that you're having them fill out.

44
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,860
Is it really actually important?
Is it actually important?

45
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,420
What purpose does it actually serve?
Because you're,

46
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,420
you want this guy who's a,
who's a good producer,

47
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:56,421
his sales are up and you want him
to continue to fill out these sales

48
00:02:56,821 --> 00:03:00,880
interaction logs so that you can and
make sure that he's making enough calls,

49
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,380
that he's got to write the right approach,

50
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:06,160
that he's using the right verbiage when
he's talking to his customers or clients.

51
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,500
And so you want him to fill this out,

52
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:13,480
but now he's actually doing well and
you got to ask yourself like, okay,

53
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,890
what purpose is this thing serving
now that the guy is doing well,

54
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:22,330
what purpose is it serving? Maybe at a
certain level you say, you know what?

55
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,170
You don't need to fill that out anymore.
If you'd sell 10 units a day,

56
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,870
you don't need to fill this out anymore.
If you sell eight a day,

57
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,910
you've got to fill out your logs because
we got to check and see what you're

58
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:33,970
doing.
That's,

59
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,540
or are you just making this person do
it because that's what everyone does.

60
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,310
So if you can't, if you can't answer the
question yourself, why it's important,

61
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,830
then maybe you should check the
why you have this thing in place.

62
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,050
So again,
we put things in place to help people,

63
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,900
but at a certain point it is possible
that they don't need to do it anymore.

64
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,810
The some salespeople,
if you don't,

65
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,730
maybe you want people to make eight phone
calls a day and you want them to log

66
00:04:07,731 --> 00:04:09,080
down what they did,
okay?

67
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:13,220
What if this guy is doing 28 phone calls
a day and he wants to get to 38 phone

68
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:16,850
calls a day, but he can't because
he's filling out your paperwork, okay?

69
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,780
So if people are meeting the numbers,
maybe raise the bar a little bit,

70
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,790
make him and you give him more freedom.
He's got the self discipline,

71
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,070
right?
He's got the discipline to make call.

72
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:30,290
He's making the numbers is numbers are up.
Okay,

73
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,150
give us more freedom.
Maybe can turn that into more production.

74
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,440
If he starts to lag off, guess what? Hey
Bud, if you keep selling 10 units a day,

75
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,650
we're good. You don't need to fill
out this crap. You go to nine,

76
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,230
you're back on the back on
the filling out of paperwork.

77
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,510
Guess what he's going to do?
You're going to sell 10 every day,

78
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:51,770
is going to sell 12 going to sell 15 and
then I would tell him, I'd say he, look,

79
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:53,690
if you sell 15 units a day,

80
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,650
I'm going to fill out a piece of
paperwork that says you're awesome dude.

81
00:04:57,651 --> 00:05:02,120
Every time you sell 15
units, boom. Little Fun.

82
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,870
Yeah. So that's it. There's,
there's the, there's the white,

83
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,180
maybe three stripe white belt answer.

84
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:12,410
Everyone should know at this
point followed by a little
bit more advanced purple

85
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:17,030
belt move Ooma Plata
at the same time.

86
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:21,080
That's not to say that it's
guaranteed, not important. Not at all.

87
00:05:21,081 --> 00:05:22,790
You just see and make
that evaluation at all.

88
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,150
And there there is a chance
that I'm wrong, right?

89
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,290
That the paperwork that gets filled out
actually really does get put into a data

90
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:33,750
file that can then be
used to, to, you know,

91
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,950
target certain customers that
follow up with certain customers.

92
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,500
And if that's the fact you explain it
to the guy and how it's going to benefit

93
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:42,880
them. And we're back to answer number one,
which worked, which is fine. Yeah know,

94
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,440
right and wrong,

95
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,580
right and wrong are interesting concepts
and people sometimes get wrapped around

96
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,930
right and wrong and they just think that
there's a right answer and there's a

97
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:02,230
answer and many times neither question
or neither answer is right or wrong or

98
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:06,560
both answers are right and wrong.

99
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,850
So you got to open your mind
on these things. You got to
open your mind. You know,

100
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,420
it was, as we talked about with
Jujitsu schools, should a judge,

101
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,660
should a Jujitsu school be
strict bow to your professor?

102
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:19,100
Everyone wear the same uniform?

103
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,170
I'm not allowed to ask people
to role or should it be, hey,

104
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:29,090
where whatever you want the instructor's
named Jocko and go in there and crews

105
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:32,740
and train heart. Which one is right? The
answers, they're both right. You can.

106
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,800
Both of those have benefits and some
people flourish in one kind of school and

107
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:39,050
some people flourish and and other kind
of school and you can't say one's right

108
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:40,310
or wrong.
Same thing.

109
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:42,530
I used to run in this a lot with
in the seal teams with tactics,

110
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,220
like should we enter the
room like this or like this?

111
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,210
And the answer is actually, well,
which is better in that scenario.

112
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,940
And sometimes this one's veterans,
sometimes that one's better.

113
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,910
And so if your mind can be more open,

114
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,420
you'll be able to use more options,
which is beneficial.

115
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,793
Yeah,

116
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,340
that's the narrow kind of
reminded me of one of my,

117
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,460
who was a friend of a friend and it was
actually my friend's friend's wife and

118
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:15,770
she was saying,
yeah,

119
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:20,771
she's kind of making light of the fact
that they force their kids to watch a

120
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,150
charger game or something
on this day or whatever.

121
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,830
And the kids don't like football
or the kid, the one kid don't like,

122
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,820
doesn't like football.

123
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:34,170
It doesn't like watching football
doesn't like this whole thing. She,

124
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,730
and she was like, oh no, it's an, it's
a tradition, you know, so you know,

125
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:41,270
we make them do it. It's the tradition,
all this stuff. I'm kind of thinking like,

126
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:44,540
okay, I mean that's cool that it's like
your tradition, but like no one likes it.

127
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,970
Like, so what is the
tradition doing? I mean,

128
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:48,410
I understand like if you have a tradition,

129
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:50,420
everyone likes it or the
tradition and it improves.

130
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:54,440
Like I don't know if the cohesion of
the family in or something like that and

131
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:57,170
you know, for all these beneficial reasons
and one way or another beneficiary,

132
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,640
but if you're doing it just
for the sake of, you know,

133
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,400
the tradition,
like this paperwork situation

134
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,930
and also what are you doing if
you're telling your kid like, no,

135
00:08:06,931 --> 00:08:08,510
you'll watch the football game.
Yeah.

136
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,180
Especially now that everyone hates the
chargers because they left San Diego

137
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:17,220
sometime ago.
But if you tell your kid,

138
00:08:17,221 --> 00:08:17,821
hey,
no,

139
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:20,490
it's a time for our family to get together
and you don't got to watch the game

140
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:23,870
but hang out, we're going to have some
hot dogs. Yeah. You know what I mean? And,

141
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:25,410
and we're just,
that's what it is.

142
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,370
It's not about staring at the screen
watching something that you don't like.

143
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,930
Yeah. It's about hanging out.
You know, grandma's coming
over, auntie's coming over,

144
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,910
we're going to cruise, we're going
to eat barbecued chicken, right? Yup.

145
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,370
That's different than, hey, you sit
down and watch the football game. Yeah.

146
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,650
But when kids reach a certain age,

147
00:08:43,651 --> 00:08:46,200
they don't want to hang out with
you for a certain time period.

148
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,510
That's what started my whole argument
right there. It wasn't an argument,

149
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,210
but that's what started my little
discourse at a certain time period.

150
00:08:54,211 --> 00:08:55,980
Your children are supposed to

151
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,770
rebel against you? Yeah,
somewhat. Cause they,

152
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:03,090
cause they have to convince themselves in
their mind that they're going to leave,

153
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,900
they're going to be on their
own and something in their
mind triggers that to be

154
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:07,321
like,
okay,

155
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:11,160
I need to separate myself from these
other humans that have been caring for me

156
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:15,480
since I was wearing diapers and now I
need to get that out of my head and figure

157
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:19,980
out how to survive on my own. So they do
that by rebelling against you and said,

158
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:21,940
I don't wash this stupid football game.
Yeah.

159
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,230
I want to go to my friend Mary's house.
Yeah.

160
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,900
We're going to do something
over there. Right. That's, yeah.

161
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,060
Do you think that there's
an element of like a pro,

162
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:35,090
you know how like when you're
a kid and you hit like 1312,

163
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:39,450
13 years old, you start to get this
like empowered feeling, you know,

164
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,550
cause you're like physically kind of
growing up and then your parents are kind

165
00:09:43,551 --> 00:09:45,030
of,
you have the feeling of oppression,

166
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,250
not that your parents are the
pretzels things are totally,

167
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,840
that's exactly what I'm saying. I'm like
it's those like an actual rebellion.

168
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:56,430
Like you can oppress me no more.
Don't have to ride with you. You know,

169
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,020
I don't have to walk with you
in the mall. No, I'm out. Yeah.

170
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:05,130
And you're trying to do that cause you
realize subconsciously that these people

171
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:07,470
are not going to be here.
I need to learn how to fend for myself.

172
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,090
I need to get out of the nest, get out
of them, start flapping them wings.

173
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:17,700
But yeah, exactly right.
But the tradition, just for
the sake of the tradition,

174
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,760
because actually my whole argument with
the lady was that you was trying to,

175
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,430
not necessarily prove but try to find
out whether or not she even thought about

176
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:30,870
it. Like, why you [inaudible]
traditions that are important, right.

177
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,370
Within a family, within a culture.
But if you lose fact, if you lose,

178
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,340
if you don't understand the
meaning of the tradition, yeah.

179
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:43,230
Then it doesn't make sense to you. Yeah.
So then you don't care about it. Yeah.

180
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:47,490
But if you say, hey look, this is our
family and this is when we get together.

181
00:10:47,491 --> 00:10:50,970
This is the only time it's her
tradition, so we're gonna do it. Yeah.

182
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,290
And that way we get to know each other
and that week we keep connected. You know,

183
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,210
we can help each other.
Cohesion, cohesion.

184
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,100
Next question Jocko.
As a leader,

185
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,610
at what point am I allowed
to go to others and say,

186
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:10,350
I need you because I recognize I'm not
capable of pushing toward forward on my

187
00:11:10,351 --> 00:11:10,920
own.

188
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,460
Or should that be an instance where I
need to take a step back and apply more

189
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:18,870
discipline to my life and find a
way to push forward by myself. Okay.

190
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:24,060
You are allowed to say that to your team
member immediately that you need them.

191
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,250
Absolutely.
If you,

192
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,110
of course you need your team because
if you didn't need your team,

193
00:11:28,111 --> 00:11:31,770
why would they be there?
If you can do everything yourself,

194
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:35,520
then you don't have a team, right?
You just do everything yourself.

195
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,510
So while you of course
should be working harder,

196
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,770
you should be applying
discipline as a leader.

197
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:45,771
It's your job to actually lead things
and to let other people support and make

198
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:48,240
things happen.
And there's nothing wrong with that.

199
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,590
And also you don't want to be stuck
in the weeds doing minute thing. So

200
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,520
if you're not capable, I think what
might be holding this individual back,

201
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,600
there's two things.

202
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,340
Number one is I feel like I should take
extreme ownership of everything. Yeah.

203
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,450
I feel like I should just
do everything myself.

204
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,160
That is not what extreme ownership is.

205
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,200
Extreme ownership isn't
doing everything yourself.

206
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,130
And also what can come into play is
your ego because you don't want to ask

207
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:17,920
people for help and
that's not a good sign.

208
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,970
There's nothing wrong with asking
people for help if you need it. In fact,

209
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:23,740
that's the humble thing to do.
Hey Echo,

210
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,530
I don't know how to quite
finish out this. Uh, you know,

211
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:28,990
this thing of this project and working
out. Can you give me a hand with us?

212
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,860
I don't know how to work a video recorder.
Can you show me how to do that, right?

213
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:37,510
Whatever. Um, so, so there's no problem
with that. You're allowed to ask. You can,

214
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,860
you can say that immediately.
In fact,

215
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:42,010
your team should feel that you are
counting on them and relying on them.

216
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:47,140
They should know that. And then
put your ego aside. Ask for help.

217
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,330
No problem.
That doesn't mean you're giving away.

218
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,980
That doesn't mean you're
not taking ownership.

219
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:52,540
That doesn't mean you're
not applying discipline.

220
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,600
It means you're working as a team
together to accomplish a mission. Again,

221
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,660
if a t if a, if a mission is so easily
that you can accomplish it yourself,

222
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,980
you don't need a team,
why do you have them?

223
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,100
If you can do it all yourself
just by applying discipline, cool.

224
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,160
You don't need anyone else if you're,

225
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,710
but your mission should be larger
than one human being can accomplish.

226
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,250
So that's why you have other people
on board to help you out. No problem.

227
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,380
You know, like, I always think when I
thought we made it out of that question,

228
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,690
go ahead. Nope. But you know,

229
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:24,691
like let's say it's like something that's
just a pain in the ass and you don't

230
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:29,980
really need help, but you just don't want
to do it by yourself. Oh, okay. I'm then,

231
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:33,780
yeah, the then you gotta just do
it yourself. Yourself. Yeah. Yeah.

232
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,550
So that's kind of where this is coming
from ultimately, because it's like,

233
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,970
I'm not saying that if you're the,
if you're,

234
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
if you have a position in a company
where you shouldn't be doing some sort of

235
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:50,491
task because it's not
financially efficient to have,

236
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,001
you know,

237
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:57,001
a person that's making $150,000 a year
doing a task that someone that's making

238
00:13:58,931 --> 00:14:02,110
$10 an hour should be doing so.
So you shouldn't do that.

239
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:04,150
That's not what I'm advocating
and accompany won't,

240
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,370
won't be doing well if you're paying
people $150,000 a year that you can get

241
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:12,130
someone to do for $10 an hour.
I'm not saying that,

242
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,110
so don't get me wrong.
Yeah.

243
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:20,050
But that's why we have a team so that
you can focus on going forward and

244
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:23,950
whatever it is you need to be focused
on and somebody that's below you in the

245
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:24,611
chain of command,

246
00:14:24,611 --> 00:14:27,520
that's a member of your team
that's getting paid $10 an
hour can do some of this

247
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:29,770
stuff that you need
them to do. Yeah. Yeah.

248
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,800
And the question actually is really
clear because it's because quote unquote,

249
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,640
because I recognize I'm not capable of
pushing, you know, it's kind of like,

250
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,010
it's obvious to you that you need
help. It's not that you're, you know,

251
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,880
raking leaves and I don't want to do
this all by myself, so hey, you know,

252
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,980
you tell your brother come help.

253
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,510
It's not that it's different.

254
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,850
Yeah. If you need to get
to the leaves raked and,

255
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,300
and you need them done by Monday so you
can get them in the bags so that the

256
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,280
dump truck can come and take the leaves
away and you can't physically get it

257
00:15:05,281 --> 00:15:08,040
done. Then your, you said to your brother,
Hey, can you give me a hand on you?

258
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,990
You get these done tonight
before the sun goes down.

259
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,560
I'm not going be able to make it in
time. Can you give me a hand? Yeah.

260
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,790
Your brother says absolutely.

261
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:18,350
Oh yeah. Got Your back. Next question.

262
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,770
What's the best way to deal with feedback?
You don't agree with my manager?

263
00:15:24,771 --> 00:15:25,790
Give my manager,

264
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:29,930
gives me feedback on my personality
that I don't agree with.

265
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:35,420
I'm only in the company five months and
he doesn't know enough about me to make

266
00:15:35,421 --> 00:15:36,410
the comments he's making.

267
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,280
I find myself wanting a con wanting
to contest with what he's saying,

268
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:45,890
but I believe this will
ultimately end poorly for me.

269
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,750
It's frustrating for me to
listen to feedback from him
about my personality when

270
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:52,400
my friends and family
would disagree with him.

271
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:54,481
Okay.
Again,

272
00:15:54,481 --> 00:15:57,750
this is one of those questions that I
think people that listen to podcast and

273
00:15:57,751 --> 00:16:01,110
know what the answer is, what you do
when someone's giving you feedback,

274
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,390
as you listen to it and you
try and make adjustments,

275
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,360
get in their head and figure
out where this is coming from.

276
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,310
They're obviously saying
this for some reason,

277
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,940
and maybe the reason is because they
have a big ego or they don't understand

278
00:16:14,851 --> 00:16:17,040
people very well, and that's
fine. And if you know that,

279
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,480
then you just learned
something about them.

280
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:23,130
But also you might not know yourself
as well as you think you do.

281
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,503
And,

282
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:29,670
and obviously if you can test with someone
saying you're going to look like you

283
00:16:29,671 --> 00:16:33,180
can't take critique, so you're right,
that's not a good approach to take.

284
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,340
Furthermore,

285
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,940
what you're saying is that your friends
and family wouldn't agree with this guy.

286
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,930
Well, guess what? They're your
friends and family, right?

287
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,290
It's like the dude's mom that,
you know,

288
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:50,070
the dude's mom always thinks the dude's
handsome, right? Losing on handsome,

289
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:53,070
but his mom thinks he's handsome and he's,
you know,

290
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,070
your friends and family think, oh I, I
can't believe they'd say that about you.

291
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,480
Well that's your friends and family.

292
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,280
There's a reason why you have
friends because they like you, they,

293
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,930
whatever purse part of
your personality is,

294
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,940
is not cool. They're over
it. Or they can deal with it.

295
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,510
Well this, this boss, the
manager can't deal with it.

296
00:17:12,511 --> 00:17:16,110
His know how to deal with it yet.
So like I said,

297
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,340
when someone gives you a critique,

298
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,400
you should actually listen to what
people have such a hard time with.

299
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:25,230
And you should actually listen and say,
okay, well maybe I'm too aggressive.

300
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,880
Maybe I'm too close minded. Whatever,
whatever critique point you're getting,

301
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,580
listen to them. Maybe someone's like, Hey,

302
00:17:32,581 --> 00:17:35,160
I don't think you take critique very well.
And you're like,

303
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,910
what are you talking about? Of course I
take critique. Well you don't know what.

304
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,870
That's what, that's my point.
So, and the other thing, like
I said, isn't doing this.

305
00:17:42,871 --> 00:17:47,700
The managers actually telling you
something about their personality and,

306
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,100
and their views,
their judgment.

307
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,890
So learn from that.
Learn what they're pretty,

308
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:54,900
they're teaching you
about their personality,

309
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:00,170
which is going to help you better
influence and nippy late and work with.

310
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:08,910
Work with that person in the future and
perhaps help make them into a better

311
00:18:08,911 --> 00:18:11,970
leader and a better supporter of
what it is that you're trying to do.

312
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,920
So calm down, relax. One of the
best things you can do when someone,

313
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,510
when someone says to you, Hey, I think
you're screwing this up as I call it.

314
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,600
Hold on, let me, let me,
let me grab a notebook.

315
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,850
I just want to take notes and make sure
I understand where you're coming from so

316
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:26,130
I can, I can make some adjustments.
I'm always looking to get better.

317
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,500
That might be a little extreme,
but you know, yeah, no,

318
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,040
hold on a second. Let me
get my notebook. Yeah,

319
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,930
so I can take notes because
I want to get better.

320
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:42,210
I over did that just a little bit.
Tell him. Yeah, but not some people,

321
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:47,400
some new, they'll take notes,
taking notes like, oh, when I was,

322
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,110
when I was running the west coast
seal training, the, the good officers.

323
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,930
Like there'd be some officers when
when I'd be putting out word to them,

324
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,800
they'd be taking notes and I was eating,
when I first saw it,

325
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,310
it was kind of like
surprise me. Yeah. Um, okay.

326
00:19:02,311 --> 00:19:04,950
This guy is just straight up taking
notes on what I'm telling you is a one on

327
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:07,290
one conversation, but he's, he's
sitting there like taking notes.

328
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,180
But if you said it with your
tone would be like, hold on.

329
00:19:12,181 --> 00:19:16,000
All jock was going to say something.
Let me get out my notebook. Oh No. Yeah,

330
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:19,560
that's sarcastic. Yeah. But there's
also not just being sarcastic.

331
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:23,880
I was leaning towards more like the
Brown noser. Oh, that guy. Oh, Echo.

332
00:19:23,881 --> 00:19:25,770
You're going to give you some feedback.
Hold on one second.

333
00:19:25,771 --> 00:19:28,560
I want to get my notes out so I can make
sure I do exactly what you're telling

334
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:29,640
me to do.
Thanks buddy.

335
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:34,050
I see again with the tone
that was the middle way.

336
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,510
The middle ground I
think. Yeah. Who is it?

337
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:41,511
Sarah Armstrong I think pointed out on
Twitter something about tone and body

338
00:19:43,441 --> 00:19:48,441
language in some psychological survey
makes up more than half of what is

339
00:19:50,011 --> 00:19:53,760
actually being said. Yeah. And I heard
that too. Um, and I was like, hey,

340
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:57,330
that sounds cool. But I
mean, you know, maybe,

341
00:19:57,331 --> 00:20:00,350
maybe not because if someone says
something that's pretty clear but then I,

342
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,850
it's kind of stuck with me and it's true.

343
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:07,470
I could literally say the same like
I dunno 10 words to you in all these

344
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:09,870
different tones and that would mean
10 different things. Oh for sure.

345
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,980
Like you can like

346
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,840
it's actually baffling in surprising
how much we can actually communicate.

347
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,570
Like if I, if I make a joke to
you like something you don't know,

348
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:25,350
my level of sarcasm, you don't know
necessarily, you have to know the person,

349
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,273
you know.

350
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,640
So there's all these things that that
have to be in place for you to effectively

351
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,230
be communicated to.

352
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,790
So like let's say you overhear
a conversation in the next room.

353
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,020
Like you could easily miss the whole
point of the conversation even though you

354
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:42,420
heard every word because you
didn't know if they're joking.

355
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:44,580
You didn't know if they're serious.
You didn't know if one guy's mad.

356
00:20:44,581 --> 00:20:47,590
You know if one guy's getting
school district and they
can take the same exit or

357
00:20:47,591 --> 00:20:49,060
they can say the same exact words,

358
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,640
but they're just saying different
things coming from different places.

359
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:56,080
You end up a lot of communication
problems with email where someone emails a

360
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:57,260
joke.
Yeah,

361
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,160
joking about something and then someone
takes it seriously and next thing you

362
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:02,020
know,
people are flying off the handle.

363
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,670
I always had that rule in my
seal platoons and tasking do.

364
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,030
You weren't allowed to joke on the
radio and the main reason for that rules

365
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:10,510
cause you,

366
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:15,510
you don't want other people outside your
organization to hear it and take it the

367
00:21:15,551 --> 00:21:18,370
wrong way. Same thing, but
at the same thing with email.

368
00:21:18,371 --> 00:21:22,600
Unless you know someone really, really
well, really, really well, you better.

369
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:27,690
It's better to keep the sarcastic comments
and just be straightforward and speak

370
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,900
plainly when you're an email, when you're
communicating with people, it's a lot.

371
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,800
It's a lot easier. And then even with
that probably has no escape from this.

372
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,120
Even with that,

373
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:41,350
you could easily come off as like
too rigid or Dang is this guy,

374
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:44,860
does this guy not like me? You know like
that's your second email. And he's like,

375
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:47,380
that's why communication is important.

376
00:21:47,381 --> 00:21:51,160
That's why learning how to
write well is important.

377
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:55,840
That's why little words that you put
in matter into phrases, into sentences,

378
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,460
they matter. Make a difference.
Thus the invention of emojis.

379
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,610
Emojis. No, you're very into emojis and

380
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,260
I sometimes I I,

381
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:15,410
I must say that I think you communicate
very well with emojis because even

382
00:22:16,811 --> 00:22:19,660
though you don't sometimes
use any words in a text to me,

383
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:24,880
I fully understand what you
mean by lightening bolt.

384
00:22:24,881 --> 00:22:29,200
Lightning bolt, lightning bolt, rainbow,
rainbow, lightening bolt, thumbs up,

385
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:35,170
chocolate fires. Shaka fire. Very
clear, right? Yeah, no I yeah,

386
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,160
yeah I agree. Yeah I agree
with that. Shock. A fire.

387
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,890
I forgot about fire. You do
quite a bit of fire. Yeah,

388
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:44,830
the lightening bolt and fire a
youth and then the shotgun for sure.

389
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:45,740
And the room with you.

390
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:48,880
I use a rainbow a lot cause
they got to lighten up the mood.

391
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:56,800
It seems like a child thing. I don't
like emoticons. I don't like emojis.

392
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,100
But you're kind of like that in real
life too though. I know, but it's,

393
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:04,710
it seems like to me it's,
yeah, it's like a kid.

394
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,130
Maybe your little daughter would do it.

395
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:11,110
Well my daughter will send me
875 emojis from my wife's phone.

396
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:16,770
All of them see if she can fill up and
I sent back. Okay. Yeah, yeah. See,

397
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,970
but you're like that in real life too
though. That's the thing. Like if you,

398
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:25,840
like if you, you know that you're running
the risk of sounding too like, you know,

399
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,290
like stoic or whatever,
you know, like if you,

400
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:32,110
if you have to answer a question with
yes when, whatever the question is,

401
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:36,100
it's a yes or no question and you
answer yes affirmatively right it,

402
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,270
you'll put yes. Period. And that'll
come off as like God talk was like,

403
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,830
I don't know what this guy is serious
or something, you know, instead of yes.

404
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,130
Point yes.

405
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,820
Two exclamation points. Lightening Bolt,
fire rainbow or something like that.

406
00:23:49,821 --> 00:23:53,240
That gives away a little bit more
like, you know, you're just like, yes.

407
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:57,950
It's as if you're just looking someone in
their eye going, yes, that's it. I know.

408
00:23:57,951 --> 00:24:00,230
That's what I'm saying.
You're really like that in real life

409
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:07,100
most of the time. Right on. Anyway.
Lightening Bolt, fire. Yeah man.

410
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:11,420
Let's emojis in there. Don't over do
it. Double Shocker. Shocker. Yeah.

411
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,730
What's the highest level of a moot
Emoji approval? You can send me

412
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:23,030
three lightening bolts. Three fires,
three shockers, three rainbows.

413
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:29,170
For sure.
Three of everything you do go for.

414
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,870
It's like you shouldn't do
for four Don Murray, you know?

415
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,970
Depends on what I say though. So
like if there's, if it's a word,

416
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,850
the vowel in the word will,
they'll be like, that's,

417
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,780
that can be infinite or what do you like
if I put it, I don't know, you know,

418
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,790
like you'll tell me something exciting
and I'll put it on and off, but Dang,

419
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:54,770
instead of Dan g, I'll put d, lowercase a,

420
00:24:54,771 --> 00:24:59,720
depending on the level of excitement, Ei,
EI, that can go infinitely by the way,

421
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:04,760
that can spend 20 text messages even over
20 days because that's how infinite it

422
00:25:04,761 --> 00:25:07,080
can be. Then the first half
of the A's and lowercase,

423
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:11,420
the second half of the are
uppercase, the end, maybe 10 ends.

424
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:16,250
Geez. All capital. Then you
know, then, so it depends.

425
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,630
It just depends on it. Just like I said,

426
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:24,560
I think you communicate well. Yeah, that's
what I'm saying on a, on a serious note,

427
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:28,430
in regards to communication that
is effective, you know what I mean?

428
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,030
You can sense my level of excitement
as opposed to cool. Period.

429
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,160
No, you're, you're,

430
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,190
you were your quick fix.

431
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,900
Like,
anyway,

432
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:56,500
next question if you're
ready. All right. Sorry.

433
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:00,910
No, no. All good. Here is a
good mood. I guess the rainbow

434
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:08,220
does things dearest Jocko.

435
00:26:08,221 --> 00:26:11,360
Speaking of lighthearted,
uh,

436
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:15,950
nice emotions dearest Jocko.
Oh,

437
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,370
okay. My bad, my bad, my bad. Jocko.

438
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:23,690
What is the difference between extreme
ownership versus the easy button?

439
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,513
Can you elaborate?

440
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:29,390
I just need a little more clarification
to connect the dots in my situation.

441
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:33,410
Okay. Again, so as a leader, yes,

442
00:26:33,411 --> 00:26:36,350
of course you are supposed to
take ownership of everything.

443
00:26:36,351 --> 00:26:39,740
Extreme ownership of everything.
That's what we talk about all the time.

444
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,980
But does this mean that you say,
I

445
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,460
will do this and I will do that and I
will do the other thing and I will do

446
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:50,820
everything that the team is
supposed to be doing? No,

447
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,380
that's not what I'm talking about.

448
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:55,470
Now ownership does mean
that you get things done.

449
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,360
You are responsible for making sure
things get done. That's what ownership is.

450
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:02,040
It as our team is in charge of something.

451
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:06,570
If our team is in charge of a project and,
and we don't get it done,

452
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:10,770
it's my fault. It's not anybody else's
fault. So that's, that's what it is.

453
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,960
It means you take responsibility
when things go wrong.

454
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:15,360
It means you take responsibility
for problems and you get them fixed.

455
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,870
That's definitely ownership.
Now,

456
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,260
the easy button and when I talk about
the easy button in a negative way,

457
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,760
because that's what I'm doing here,

458
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,700
it's when your subordinates
come to you and say,

459
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:32,100
how should I do this? Or, or what's the
best way to execute this? Or can you,

460
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:37,410
can you tell me a good plan on how
we should make this happen? Or even,

461
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,120
hey,
there's bad news.

462
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:44,100
Can you come tell my people because
I don't really want to do it. Now.

463
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:47,940
If you say yes to those types
of things on a regular basis,

464
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,280
then what you're doing is you're actually,

465
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:54,660
you're actually stunting the growth of
your subordinate leader because instead

466
00:27:54,661 --> 00:27:57,340
when you come to me and you say,
Hey Jocko, we've got this semester,

467
00:27:57,341 --> 00:28:00,480
we've got a plan. How do you think
we should do it? If I say, okay,

468
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:01,930
we should come in from the
north, you should, you know,

469
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,390
set up an Overwatch position here.

470
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:06,570
You should move to the target from this
direction. You didn't learn anything.

471
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,390
You just took what I told
you. It's not. I say, well go,

472
00:28:09,391 --> 00:28:11,370
come up with your best plan and
come back to me and brief me on it.

473
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,330
And so now you might be kind of bummed
out because you wanted, you didn't have,

474
00:28:15,331 --> 00:28:16,530
want to have to do this extra work,

475
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,270
but now you've got to go
do a little extra work.

476
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:20,640
But now you're learning
and in two or three times,

477
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:22,560
you're not even come to ask me any more.
You're going to come with a plan.

478
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:26,160
And because we already did a cycle
cycle after cycle of you saying, Hey,

479
00:28:26,161 --> 00:28:27,240
here's my plan and be saying,
hey,

480
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:30,180
make this adjustment and you come back
next time you say, here's my plan.

481
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,280
I said make this little adjustment.
And eventually, you know,

482
00:28:32,281 --> 00:28:34,680
to make those adjustments on your own
and now you can do it by yourself.

483
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,480
And that's what we want.

484
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:39,390
I don't want to stunt the growth
of my subordinate leaders,

485
00:28:39,391 --> 00:28:43,290
so I don't want to be an easy button.
Um,

486
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,200
so you're providing the easy button,

487
00:28:46,201 --> 00:28:48,640
like that's what they're talking
about when they see easy button. Yeah.

488
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,480
If you didn't want to be that you don't
want to be an easy button for everybody

489
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:55,470
else. And I also, no one's going to
be able to take your job from you,

490
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,420
which is actually what you want.
You want.

491
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:00,330
I want to make every one
of my subordinates so good
that they can take my job

492
00:29:00,331 --> 00:29:00,750
from me.

493
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:05,730
That means I can step up and look forward
and look out and they can do a better

494
00:29:05,731 --> 00:29:07,500
job of handling what
they've got to handle.

495
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:09,330
And eventually when it's
my time to get promoted,

496
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,290
I got people to take my
place and we're all good. Um,

497
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:17,100
of course that doesn't mean leave them
blind or let them fail. Don't do that.

498
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,780
Give you want to give them rope,

499
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,530
but you don't give them enough
rope to hang themselves.

500
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,090
You give them enough rope that they may
be get a little not in the rope and it

501
00:29:27,091 --> 00:29:29,250
gives a little bit sloppy and you,
and then you go over to me and say,

502
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,290
there's a lot here.
Let me help you get that untied.

503
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,490
And now you give them the rope again
so you don't eat. You know, in, in, uh,

504
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,140
in the military,

505
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:41,040
you don't let someone go do a mission
that's real where someone's gonna get

506
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,220
killed or mission failure because you
want it to not be the easy button. No,

507
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:47,740
you don't do that in the civilian sector.

508
00:29:47,741 --> 00:29:51,550
You don't let someone lose a big client
or lose a bunch of money or make a

509
00:29:51,551 --> 00:29:54,610
mistake that costs a bunch of capital
because you didn't want to be the easy

510
00:29:54,611 --> 00:29:58,150
button. No, no ums. Now might you let
someone make a little mistake? Sure.

511
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,880
Little mistake that cost them
a little bit of money. Sure.

512
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:04,090
So they learned a lesson. Sure. Yeah,
but you don't let them fall on your face.

513
00:30:04,091 --> 00:30:07,180
You don't let them hang or hang
themselves. So that's that.

514
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:14,990
Next question.
Dearest Jocko,

515
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,000
a question for you and the podcast.

516
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:23,160
Our Fire Department promotion process
has role playing scenarios and those role

517
00:30:23,161 --> 00:30:26,880
playing scenarios. I lose points
because I'm not outwardly passionate,

518
00:30:26,881 --> 00:30:27,870
quote unquote,
you know,

519
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,490
I would have to fake it to
succeed and I'm not a fake person.

520
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:36,120
Is this worth it to fake
it when seeking promotion.

521
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,810
It's not like I'm going to fake
it once they attain the promotion.

522
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:43,130
Okay, great. This is a, this
is a very cool question.

523
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:46,490
I like this question a lot and actually
on this guy sent me this question on

524
00:30:46,491 --> 00:30:46,941
Facebook,

525
00:30:46,941 --> 00:30:51,941
I responded very quickly
and simply my response was,

526
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:57,920
play the game. Yeah, so
fake. You play the game and,

527
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,130
and you know what he wrote
back? Got It. Good for him.

528
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:05,120
Because what everybody I think
thinks I'm going to say is that no,

529
00:31:05,121 --> 00:31:07,700
you don't yourself. No,
you don't play the game.

530
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,130
You're not going to get up there and act
all passionate about stuff. You're you,

531
00:31:11,131 --> 00:31:16,030
you're hardcore. No. Play the game
now you, because what you're doing,

532
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:16,700
you play the game.

533
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,390
You want to do good job and you're doing
your job and doing your job. To me,

534
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,340
any job requires some level of faking it.

535
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:28,700
Yeah. Now, does this mean
that you're a fake person? No.

536
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,020
It means that you're
trying to do a good job. I

537
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:36,610
think if every time that your boss
came in with a dumb idea and you,

538
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,130
your reaction was to say,
that's a dumb idea.

539
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:45,370
Is that going to get you anywhere or
every time a customer had an idiot, idiot,

540
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:49,190
idiotic complaint about something,
you were like, hey, you're an idiot.

541
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:55,310
Or every time your wife said,
you know,

542
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,200
is this chicken dry?

543
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:02,240
And you said it's dryer than a piece of
cardboard in the Sahara desert. Is that,

544
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,750
is that easy? You know, art, would
you, would you benefit from that?

545
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,770
How would that work out you?
The answers you would,

546
00:32:09,771 --> 00:32:14,510
he would not work out well in any of
those cases. You have to play the game.

547
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,580
You have to play the game.
And I know,

548
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:20,540
I know that that's hard.

549
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,720
And I'll tell you what I did to
get myself over playing the game.

550
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,290
I turned it into a game in my head.
I was like,

551
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:36,080
I'm going to build a relationship
with this boss that I don't like.

552
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,930
I'm going to do it. Yeah. I'm going
to build the best relate. That's my,

553
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,540
I'm going to go,
I'm going to become this guy's bro.

554
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,030
Right when I was at
officer candidate school,

555
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:48,200
you got to do the most ridiculous rules.

556
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:53,950
They have these rules that you've got
to follow that were really annoying and

557
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:55,760
you know what I did?
I,

558
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,680
I executed the rules harder
and more stringently than,

559
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:05,120
than anybody thought was even remotely
necessary and had fun with it.

560
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,000
I played that game. I, you know,

561
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:14,600
if I've got a peer that may be, um,
competing with, or there's some tension,

562
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,120
I'm going to support them. I'm going to
play the game. That's what I'm saying.

563
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:20,960
You got to play the game. Now does this
make me a bad person or a fake person? No.

564
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,890
Why? Because you're doing this,
the reason you're playing the game,

565
00:33:24,891 --> 00:33:29,891
the reason your act as acting this
way is for benevolent reasons,

566
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,510
right? This, this guy
at the fire department,

567
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:37,890
he's not trying to get promoted so that
he can usurp the powers and then take

568
00:33:38,661 --> 00:33:39,494
over.
No,

569
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:44,690
he tried to get into a position where
he can better lead and serve and,

570
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,800
and step up and raise young leaders
underneath them that that's what you're

571
00:33:48,801 --> 00:33:49,634
trying to do.

572
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,640
You're not trying to sneak into a
position you don't deserve and you're not

573
00:33:52,641 --> 00:33:56,420
trying to build relationships so you can
take advantage of people for your own

574
00:33:56,421 --> 00:34:01,220
benefit that that would be
a fake person in my opinion.

575
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:02,720
You're trying to move,

576
00:34:02,721 --> 00:34:07,100
but if you're trying to move up in rank
so you can do better and you can take

577
00:34:07,101 --> 00:34:09,350
care of the troops and you
can increase readiness,

578
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,800
there's nothing wrong with that.

579
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,860
And if you don't play the
game to us at some level,

580
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,710
you're not going to get promoted.
And guess what?

581
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,550
Then people that played the
game that might be less,

582
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:26,120
less qualified to do that job,

583
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,940
they're going to get the job
because you wouldn't play the game.

584
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,560
You're too stubborn.
Your ego is too big.

585
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,250
So you got to put that aside and
I'll tell you something else.

586
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,730
Learn from what you're being told.

587
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:43,880
If if you're showing no passion,
if you're showing like zero motion,

588
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,400
that's bad.
People will not connect with you.

589
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:52,130
And if they don't connect with you,
they don't follow you.

590
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:54,740
If they don't connect with you, you're
not building relationships with people.

591
00:34:54,741 --> 00:34:57,830
If you don't have relationships with
people, you don't have a good team.

592
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:03,380
So show a little bit of passion.
Sometimes you gotta fake it. That's fine.

593
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:07,400
You're just a really unpassionate person.
Cool. Show a little bit of passion,

594
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,140
fake it a little bit,

595
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,530
learn it a little bit cause it's
actually going to be beneficial.

596
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:15,180
I would love for you to fake it
for a little while until you're,

597
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:18,230
you start caring. Like what are
you are not passionate about?

598
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,820
Are you not passionate about the job?
Are you not passionate about,

599
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,300
you're a firefighter about saving people's
lives are you're not passionate about

600
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:29,840
having a squared away department? Of
course you're passionate about that stuff.

601
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,720
Otherwise you wouldn't be, you wouldn't
be sending me a message saying, hey,

602
00:35:32,721 --> 00:35:34,640
how do I get advanced? How
do I do? How do I do better?

603
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:38,010
You are passionate about
it and that's fine. It's

604
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,070
good. Um, I say it all the time. You know,

605
00:35:41,071 --> 00:35:43,950
if you don't have any emotions
that you're a robot and robots,

606
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,170
people don't fall robots,
immune cell.

607
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:50,760
Sometimes you got to show a little bit
of that emotion and passion to connect

608
00:35:50,761 --> 00:35:55,050
with people. And that's okay. Yeah. Don't
be scared, homey. Yeah. Don't be scared.

609
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,150
Yeah. Cause that's
really the thing, right,

610
00:35:57,151 --> 00:36:00,810
is showing it of course you're passionate
about but showing it because different

611
00:36:00,811 --> 00:36:02,850
people, they know
something. Brian, I dig it.

612
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:07,200
I don't want to always be like showing
how fired up I am all the time or

613
00:36:07,201 --> 00:36:11,510
whatever in whatever scenario, whatever.
But you're right, that does help. Yeah.

614
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,520
Like when he was excited about it.
And there's a,

615
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:18,210
there's a dichotomy here because there's
some people that will show too much

616
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,940
emotion and there's some people
that will not show enough.

617
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:25,410
So you want to be somewhere bounced
in the middle. Yeah. Yeah. It's true.

618
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,770
And I dig it too when,

619
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:30,600
cause it does feel like faking it because
like in football that tradition is

620
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:34,740
like to be fired up on the sidelines.
Let's go, let's go, let's go. You know,

621
00:36:34,741 --> 00:36:35,490
like that kind of,

622
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:38,040
but probably sometimes you don't have
the energy for that and sometimes you're

623
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:40,800
kind of just nervous and you want to
focus on what you got to do or whatever,

624
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:44,060
you know. But it's kind of part
of the game, you know? And,

625
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,300
and it does help the people around you
too. And he's like, okay, he's fired up.

626
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:51,600
Okay. Maybe I'm not fired up now, but he's
kind of getting me fired up, you know?

627
00:36:51,601 --> 00:36:54,660
And it kind of like helps
the team. Yeah. But yeah,

628
00:36:54,661 --> 00:36:59,070
sometimes it doesn't feel that comfortable
to do express outwardly. You know,

629
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,700
how passionate, but it helps.
Plus this fake like faking it.

630
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,050
That's like a framing thing too.

631
00:37:04,051 --> 00:37:07,200
You know how like if you frame it like
you're faking it versus how you said

632
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:08,490
you're playing the game,
right.

633
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:11,070
You're playing the game because
you want to do a better job. Yeah.

634
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,950
Want to get promoted. You
want to, you want to get
promoted for the right reasons.

635
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:17,400
Yeah. There's nothing wrong with that.
Yeah. That's that. Yeah. That's good.

636
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:21,180
I think if you can kind of
bend and stretch yourself
in an uncomfortable way for

637
00:37:21,181 --> 00:37:24,000
the benefit, you know, I, you
know, I think where people,

638
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:29,260
I think that term of faking it, no
one wants to be a fake person, right?

639
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,130
Yes. Which, which is why
you're correct in that.

640
00:37:32,131 --> 00:37:37,131
The way that's framed is I'm being a
fake person and no one wants to be a fake

641
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:42,060
person. Yeah. At the same time,

642
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:48,500
you have to grow and you have to adjust.

643
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,610
And if you're going to be
in a leadership position,

644
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:55,380
you're Gunna do things that you don't,
that you wouldn't have planned.

645
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:59,810
I do that all the time. I mean, when
I was in the military, you know,

646
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:02,030
I worked with people that I, you
know, I've said this before I could,

647
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:03,690
where I work with people both below me,

648
00:38:03,691 --> 00:38:08,250
the chain of command and up above me in
the chain of command that I despised.

649
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,180
They never knew it. They don't
know who they are right now. Dang.

650
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:19,220
But you know what? Remember that? What
does that make me a fake person? No,

651
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:20,490
it makes me a professional.

652
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:23,790
Makes me a professional at doing my
job because I wasn't gonna get let some

653
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:25,650
little personal emotion of mind or some,

654
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:29,400
oh that guys does this and I don't like
that, so I'm not going to like him.

655
00:38:29,401 --> 00:38:34,200
And now we have an adversarial
relationship and now we've
got a problem. Yeah, no,

656
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:39,080
I'm playing the game. Play
the game. So where's the line?

657
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:42,800
What is a fake person? Genuinely,
well, I was going to say,

658
00:38:42,801 --> 00:38:43,611
you asked me what the line is.

659
00:38:43,611 --> 00:38:46,790
The line is if you go against what
your principles are, you know,

660
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:51,120
so if you've got fundamental principles
that they say, Oh, if you want this job,

661
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:56,121
but what we need to you to do is fill
out a report about Billy saying that he

662
00:38:57,951 --> 00:39:01,580
did something wrong, that
you know he didn't do wrong.
Right? And then you go, no,

663
00:39:01,581 --> 00:39:05,910
I'm not going to do that. That,
that, that's what, that's bad. Right?

664
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,300
That's not now you're not
just playing the game.

665
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,620
Now you're going against
your principles of being a,

666
00:39:10,621 --> 00:39:14,960
an honest person about what's happening.
Yeah. That's really what it is. Right?

667
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:19,220
Like the honesty when you're a faker. So
like if someone's like, oh, I'm faking it,

668
00:39:19,221 --> 00:39:22,550
or I'm being a fake person.
How you sit in a fake person,

669
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,950
like turning on some passion,

670
00:39:24,951 --> 00:39:27,530
some manufactured passion for the
sake of the team and stuff like that.

671
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:30,530
That doesn't feel like you're
a fake person, fake person.

672
00:39:30,531 --> 00:39:32,810
It's kind of like you'll sit like some,
I dunno for example,

673
00:39:32,811 --> 00:39:35,570
someone's in the room and
you're like, hey, you're great.

674
00:39:35,571 --> 00:39:38,330
That shirt looks great and you're doing a
great job. They leave and be like, fuck,

675
00:39:38,331 --> 00:39:41,510
I suck so bad. The reason I'll tell you
the difference, the reason that someone,

676
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,030
the reason that you would consider
someone and be angry that someone's a fake

677
00:39:44,031 --> 00:39:48,200
person is when they are doing it because
they're doing it for personal benefit.

678
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:52,640
Oh yeah. They're, they're
saying like if, if, if,

679
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:57,470
if you were my boss and I
come in and I say, hey echo,

680
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,930
I really like your new haircut.
It looks great.

681
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,500
I don't really think that
your haircut looks done,

682
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,240
but I'm going to say that
anyways and everyone knows that.

683
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,830
All I want to do is get that next
promotion. Yeah. That's being fake. Yeah.

684
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:13,050
Makes Sense. Being fake.
But if, if I'm saying, well,

685
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:17,000
cause what am I really doing?
What I'm doing is I'm, I'm,
I'm making an adaptation.

686
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,790
I'm growing.
I'm,

687
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,450
I'm doing something that I'm uncomfortable
with because I know it's gonna make

688
00:40:23,451 --> 00:40:24,284
me a better leader.

689
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:29,570
That's what I should be doing is trying
to become a better leader. Now again, if,

690
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,420
if, if in this, whatever organization,

691
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,820
what you have to do is,

692
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:40,590
is do something that you don't agree with
and it's,

693
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:45,470
it's the wrong thing to do and you do
it anyways, we'll then, then that's,

694
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,770
that's, that's, that's almost
a totally different thing.
There's that. Then there's,

695
00:40:48,771 --> 00:40:52,310
hey, I'm going to kiss ass
so that I get promoted.

696
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,640
It's all about me and that's probably
the what we think of the definition of a

697
00:40:58,641 --> 00:41:00,240
fake person.
Yeah.

698
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:02,893
Okay.

699
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:07,853
Next question.

700
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:13,850
I saw a weakness in you
on your latest podcast.

701
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:18,110
You seem to overlook the fact that
some infant children were raised in

702
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:21,380
undisciplined environments
with undisciplined parents.

703
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:25,790
They grew up having modeled
these undisciplined examples.

704
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:28,160
I hate the fact that I have growth,

705
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,910
undisciplined behavior solving this
is a major priority in my life.

706
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:33,980
You have zero of what it,

707
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:38,060
of what this experience is like for me.
You seem blind to this struggle,

708
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:43,061
like a father who would ignore their child
struggle and offer only the words man

709
00:41:44,481 --> 00:41:45,314
up.

710
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:53,440
So this is a good question and I see
where this guy's coming from for sure.

711
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,440
And I know that it can be very,

712
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,820
very frustrating to try
and become disciplined.

713
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:03,260
Yeah.

714
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:07,910
And I apologize that I haven't talked
about the fact of of what to do if you

715
00:42:07,911 --> 00:42:11,810
come from an undisciplined family
or you have on disciplined parents.

716
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:14,630
I haven't really talked about
what to do in that situation,

717
00:42:14,631 --> 00:42:17,180
but there's a reason that I
haven't talked about that before.

718
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:21,200
And that is because you don't get
disciplined from your parents.

719
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:26,910
You don't get disciplined from your
parents, from your grandparents,

720
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,980
from your older brothers and sisters.

721
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:32,970
You don't get disciplined
from an external source.

722
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:38,520
You have to get it from you.
That's what self discipline is.

723
00:42:38,521 --> 00:42:42,690
You get it from yourself,
you get it from you. So

724
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:48,920
here's people from every
possible background,

725
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,160
from no parents to crazy parents too,

726
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:55,010
you know,

727
00:42:55,010 --> 00:43:00,010
drug addicted parents to super squared
away parents and everywhere in between on

728
00:43:01,821 --> 00:43:06,821
that spectrum that are completely
disciplined people more disciplined than

729
00:43:07,341 --> 00:43:08,390
anyone I know.

730
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:14,150
It doesn't come from your parents,
you don't inherit it.

731
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:19,630
And there's another piece here.
It's called ownership,

732
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:21,790
right? It's called
ownership. And if you're,

733
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:25,990
if you want to blame other
people for the problem,

734
00:43:25,991 --> 00:43:28,990
and I say this all the time, if you
don't take ownership of the problem,

735
00:43:28,991 --> 00:43:29,890
the problem's not going to get salt.

736
00:43:29,891 --> 00:43:32,770
So if you blame your parents for not
having raised you in a discipline

737
00:43:32,771 --> 00:43:34,990
environment,
you're not going to solve that problem.

738
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:36,610
You're looking at your parents.

739
00:43:36,611 --> 00:43:40,510
And if you would've done a better
job being more disciplined for me,

740
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:42,340
I would be more disciplined now.

741
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:46,840
So that means that means you can't do
anything. The fact of the matter is,

742
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:50,440
it's wrong. You actually can do
something and it doesn't matter what,

743
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,560
how your parents raised
you and brought you up.

744
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:58,270
You can have the discipline
you need to decide to do it.

745
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,920
So as long as you're blaming
other people, I mean,

746
00:44:04,921 --> 00:44:06,720
even if you blame me
for not discussing it,

747
00:44:06,721 --> 00:44:09,270
you blame me for having zero idea
what that experience is like.

748
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,550
You blame your parents for
not raising you this way.

749
00:44:11,551 --> 00:44:12,960
As long as you're blaming other people,

750
00:44:12,961 --> 00:44:14,910
as long as you're counting on other
people to give you discipline,

751
00:44:14,911 --> 00:44:16,920
as long as you do that,
you will not have it.

752
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:22,830
So again, I, I'm sorry
I should've made that.

753
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,410
I should make that more clearly and
I'm trying to make it more clearly now.

754
00:44:25,411 --> 00:44:29,550
And like my parents,
my parents are good people.

755
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:32,460
They had successful as,

756
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:35,490
as educators in public schools.

757
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:37,950
And my mom eventually became a,

758
00:44:37,951 --> 00:44:42,930
went into school administration and
my dad taught in high school for 30

759
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:47,100
something years and they were good,
hardworking people. And I'll tell you,

760
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:47,934
they were no,

761
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:52,740
they were no extraordinary
preachers of discipline.

762
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:56,070
And I'll tell you, I, I in fact, I,

763
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:02,690
I never remember either one of them
ever using the term or referring to

764
00:45:04,141 --> 00:45:07,920
discipline in any way. Um, you know,
and actually both my parents worked,

765
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,240
they both worked a lot.

766
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:14,280
My Dad was coaching sports and we'll do
an afterschool stuff. My mom, same thing,

767
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:17,640
like we were on our own a bunch.
Well my parents were gone in the morning.

768
00:45:17,641 --> 00:45:20,550
We got ourselves to school when we got
home in the afternoon. They weren't home.

769
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:21,840
Uh,
you know,

770
00:45:21,841 --> 00:45:26,700
so it wasn't like they were setting up
this rigid disciplined manner for me.

771
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,550
Right. Yeah. And um,

772
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,630
and you can see this with families,
many, many different families.

773
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:38,720
There's families that have kids that
the parents are very disciplined and the

774
00:45:39,121 --> 00:45:43,950
kids are wild and out of control
sometimes it problematically, so, right.

775
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,010
Kids that come from really good families,
but they get addicted to drugs,

776
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:51,150
lack of discipline. Kids that come
from really good families, but they,

777
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,180
they spin out of control and,
and going the wrong direction.

778
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:57,720
And there's also the opposite,
which is pay.

779
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,990
The parents weren't around or the parents
were abusive or the parents were drug

780
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:02,580
addicts and all of a sudden the kid,

781
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,980
the kid comes out of that and
then is squared away is awesome.

782
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,290
And we saw that all the
time in the seal teams.

783
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,720
And I've said that before on
this program doesn't matter.

784
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,740
It doesn't matter where your background
is, it is what you decide to do. Yeah.

785
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,880
Um,
and I'll tell you another thing,

786
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:21,670
it's not even from the military,

787
00:46:21,671 --> 00:46:24,670
like the military requires
discipline obviously,

788
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,920
but there's plenty of people in the
military that don't have it right. And,

789
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:30,850
and many poor,

790
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,880
many people lose their discipline when
they leave the mulch because it's not

791
00:46:33,881 --> 00:46:38,320
being imposed on them anymore. So,
I mean, just go look around. I mean,

792
00:46:38,321 --> 00:46:41,020
being in the military does not
make you a discipline person.

793
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:44,590
Being from a discipline family does
not make you a discipline person.

794
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:48,160
Being in a discipline group does
not make you a discipline person.

795
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,550
What makes you disciplined person
is choosing to be disciplined.

796
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:58,120
So yeah, I, I, and,

797
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,430
and also as far as telling
people to man up, um, which,

798
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:08,070
you know, when someone says, how
do I get up early every day, I say,

799
00:47:08,071 --> 00:47:10,260
get up early every day.
How do I stop eating sugar?

800
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:12,970
Stop eating sugar if that's
the definition of man up.

801
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:15,420
But obviously is not just men that
need discipline in their life.

802
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,160
I don't think I use that term, but what
I do tell people is to get after it.

803
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:23,700
That's what I tell people to get after it.

804
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,380
I tell people to do the things that
they know they're supposed to do, right?

805
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,900
There's things that you know you're
supposed to do as a human being.

806
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:35,530
Things that you know are gonna
Improve Your Life. Do those things.

807
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,470
There's things that you know are going
to make you a worse person and make your

808
00:47:38,471 --> 00:47:40,720
life worse.
Don't do those things.

809
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,260
Don't do the things that
are making you weaker.

810
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:48,790
Start doing the things that are going
to make you stronger and smarter and

811
00:47:48,791 --> 00:47:52,060
faster and healthier and get to
make you a better human being.

812
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:53,740
And I'll say the same thing to this guy.

813
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:55,680
Yeah,

814
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,600
you want to be more disciplined. Get
after it. That's it, man. Get up early.

815
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:03,840
Do some kind of workout. Eat
good foods, clean your room,

816
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:06,690
make a list of things that you're
supposed to do in your life,

817
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,140
and then wake up in the morning and do
those things that you put on the list.

818
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:16,330
That's what discipline is
and no,

819
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,320
it is not easy, but you're not going
to get it from anyone else but you

820
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:26,070
and it's worth it. And it is the thing
that is going to bring you freedom.

821
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:32,550
That's the key word right there.
When you said it's worth it.

822
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,320
You know what,
I think this is what I think.

823
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:38,340
I think like in an environment
as like how he put it,

824
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:42,750
an undisciplined environment or aunt or
something like that where he grew up in

825
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:46,130
an undisciplined environment.
I don't,

826
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:50,370
obviously that's a very
vague expression, right?

827
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:54,090
Undisciplined environment. I mean that
can mean a lot of different things.

828
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:57,990
So a lot of times like when you're
brought up in a certain environment,

829
00:48:57,991 --> 00:49:02,600
basically you're kind of
taught or, or not taught, like,

830
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:06,060
like the value of certain things.
So if you use like, I don't know,

831
00:49:06,061 --> 00:49:10,890
working out or whatever. Right.
So I'm going to use myself as an,

832
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,410
as an example. My Dad was
an athlete, um, you know,

833
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:17,750
not a superior athlete,
but he was, you know, he,

834
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,590
he knew like working out was a part of
life and stuff like that. And you know,

835
00:49:22,591 --> 00:49:27,300
in elementary school were doing sports and
stuff like that. You know, some people,

836
00:49:27,301 --> 00:49:28,620
they don't do that at all.

837
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:32,550
So when they grow up into adulthood
that some people straight up have never

838
00:49:32,551 --> 00:49:35,550
worked out before,
never been in a gym and you know,

839
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:40,850
so growing up they were never taught the
value of what working out does for you.

840
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:43,050
They never taught.
So they can't appreciate it.

841
00:49:43,051 --> 00:49:46,830
They just simply don't know the value
share or they see people with, you know,

842
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:47,670
you know,

843
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:50,250
they're in shape or they can do these
things and they're very functioning,

844
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:53,640
whatever they see that of course,
but they don't have that value.

845
00:49:53,641 --> 00:49:57,050
They don't feel that value. They
just never learned it. So it,

846
00:49:57,051 --> 00:50:00,330
it can come off as like this
thing for other people, you know,

847
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,280
like well that's what other
people do kind of thing.

848
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:06,690
So they don't understand the value.
So back to the point in their mind,

849
00:50:06,691 --> 00:50:07,351
this weird,

850
00:50:07,351 --> 00:50:10,830
the connection is not made that it's
worth it because they don't know the value

851
00:50:10,831 --> 00:50:14,910
of it really. But if you do know the
value of it and then you can decide, okay,

852
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,930
is this worth it,

853
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:20,430
is it worth it to wake up every day and
in quote unquote get after it for this

854
00:50:20,431 --> 00:50:24,030
particular goal or this particular
set of goals. So that's what it is.

855
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:27,860
And I think sure the
undisciplined environment

856
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:32,180
can maybe provide that. But I think you're
right. I think that once you're like,

857
00:50:32,181 --> 00:50:33,980
oh yeah that's worth it,
you know, help people,

858
00:50:33,981 --> 00:50:37,400
they'll find reasons when it's worth it.
Even though they've never expect like,

859
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,450
you know, like a person who has a
heart attack or something, it's like,

860
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:43,190
and they have kids or young kids or
something, they have a heart attack,

861
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:45,590
maybe never worked out ever in their life.
They have a heart attack,

862
00:50:45,591 --> 00:50:48,380
they almost died. They're like guess
what? I'm working out every single day.

863
00:50:48,381 --> 00:50:51,350
I'm a vegetarian now.
You know like doing major,

864
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:53,890
major changes that they've
never even thought about making.

865
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:58,040
And they'll do it because they decided
it's worth it and they'll be discipline.

866
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,750
They'll find that discipline real quick,

867
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:03,680
no matter how they were trained as you
know, their environment and their cause.

868
00:51:03,681 --> 00:51:08,000
Now I see that it's going to be
worth it. That's it. Yeah. And if,

869
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:11,600
if it's not worth it to use,
and that I think is what you develop,

870
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:15,500
the value of working out,
the value of you develop,

871
00:51:15,501 --> 00:51:19,190
you can develop that from anywhere. That's
what I'm saying. That's essentially,

872
00:51:19,191 --> 00:51:23,570
that's part of the early develop that
from any, any, you can develop that from,

873
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,900
from anywhere. Yeah. You can
get it from parents who can
get it from, yeah, exactly.

874
00:51:26,901 --> 00:51:30,230
Right, exactly right. But the
discipline itself, just like I said,

875
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:33,080
that's going to come from you.
Your parents can teach it,

876
00:51:33,081 --> 00:51:36,470
but guess who has to the, it's
still you. It's still you.

877
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:41,300
And you can go to the
military to specifically learn
discipline when you leave,

878
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:44,990
it's on you. Who's it? Yeah, exactly.
Right. And just like I said, like yeah,

879
00:51:44,991 --> 00:51:48,140
I know people who are done
with the military and are
glad they're done with that.

880
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:50,480
They're glad with this waking up early.

881
00:51:50,481 --> 00:51:53,780
They're next monster out of shape.

882
00:51:53,781 --> 00:51:56,910
They're not doing anything productive.
It's, it's horrible to say,

883
00:51:58,070 --> 00:52:01,620
but it happens. Happens with the
military. It happens with anything. Yeah.

884
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,690
It was when kids get out of
high school sports, you know,

885
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:06,560
and all of a sudden they don't want,
I don't have to do that anymore.

886
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:11,230
I don't have to listen to
coach. Yeah. Yeah. Crazy.

887
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:14,150
Don't listen to coach. Listen
to yourself yourself. Yeah.

888
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,590
Determine whether or not it's worth it.
And I'm telling you do,

889
00:52:18,591 --> 00:52:21,110
you don't need to determine, I'm
telling you it's worth it. Oh yeah.

890
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,000
I'm telling you it is worth it.
And you know what?

891
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,910
You actually know it's worth it.
That's why you're asking this question.

892
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,670
You know it's worth it. You know
what's worth it to have discipline.

893
00:52:28,671 --> 00:52:30,110
But you think there's an easier way.

894
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,090
You think that it's
something that people have.

895
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:36,110
You think that when Jockos alarm
clock goes off, it's like, oh,

896
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:40,550
just like my father taught me, I rise
and I shine. You know what I'm like, no,

897
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:41,720
I,

898
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:45,800
it's like the pillow feel
soft and comfortable and the
alarm clock is banging on

899
00:52:45,801 --> 00:52:47,770
my head and I don't like it.
But you know what,

900
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:50,060
I know it's worth it to
get up and get after it.

901
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,790
I know it's worth it and you know it's
worth it. Here's the thing though,

902
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:55,520
we all know what's worse is
in in a way you're right,

903
00:52:55,521 --> 00:52:59,110
but like really though
really I'm going to be open,

904
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:02,600
open and honest with you. I don't think
that that people know it's worth it.

905
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:05,060
I think they know it's worth it.
Like the kind of on paper,

906
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,510
they have a multiple choice question, is
it worth it? Yes or no? There'll be like,

907
00:53:08,511 --> 00:53:12,740
yes. Obviously I know working out
is worth it. But here's the thing.

908
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,600
I don't if you don't know, if you don't
like like having good credit for example.

909
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:22,250
So I never got taught like
why really? My Mom said, yeah,

910
00:53:22,251 --> 00:53:23,750
you should have good credit.
That's it.

911
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:27,020
That's the limit to my
education on credit. Right.

912
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:29,520
So of course they're below it
because they get, you know,

913
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:34,580
I fall for literally all the tricks if
self-inflicted and otherwise credit gets

914
00:53:35,461 --> 00:53:38,880
jammed up. So, so I don't know. I
don't know the value. I don't know.

915
00:53:38,881 --> 00:53:41,740
I've never experienced the
benefits of having good car.

916
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:44,610
I don't know the value of good credit.
So it really didn't mean much to me.

917
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,360
Really.

918
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:50,130
My credit was like junk and I didn't care
until I got denied for something then

919
00:53:50,131 --> 00:53:50,980
I cared.
You know.

920
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:54,750
But just like if you're never into
working out until you're in a specific

921
00:53:54,751 --> 00:53:55,880
situation where shows,

922
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:59,490
but like this guy that's
asking this question and glad
he's asking the question,

923
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:04,260
I'm, I'm not, I'm trying, I'm not
trying to come off all hard. Um,

924
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:08,670
but he realizes she realizes
the value of discipline.

925
00:54:08,671 --> 00:54:10,890
Cause he's saying that he wants it.
Right.

926
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:14,220
He knows that it's going to
make his life better. Yeah. And,

927
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:19,200
and that's why I think he,
he's gotten jammed up in whatever way.

928
00:54:19,201 --> 00:54:22,830
We don't know, cause I don't know,
maybe he's gotten unhealthy. Maybe he's,

929
00:54:22,831 --> 00:54:25,710
you know, who knows, maybe he's
gotten his finances jammed up,

930
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:29,280
whatever the case may be. He knows that
discipline is better for them. Him,

931
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,240
he knows that. He does know this
isn't a guy that doesn't know yet.

932
00:54:33,241 --> 00:54:36,660
Cause sure there's people that don't,
you know, when you're 16 years old,

933
00:54:36,661 --> 00:54:39,210
you don't know the value of discipline.
You don't know that the, what you're,

934
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,100
the way you're acting right now,
it's gonna affect you in five years.

935
00:54:41,101 --> 00:54:44,940
You don't know that you can set yourself
your whole life up to be pretty awesome.

936
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:46,470
Yeah.
You don't know that yet.

937
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,430
You're just like worried about where
you're going on a Friday night. Right.

938
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:56,060
So this guy knows and he wants it and
he's looking for where he can find it and

939
00:54:59,311 --> 00:55:03,870
where he can find it is in the
mirror. Yeah. That's where it is,

940
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:08,890
you know, so do it brother. Good luck. Get
on the path and stay on the path. Yeah.

941
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:13,500
And that's going to be beneficial
when you do the harshly.

942
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:17,010
Maintaining that, like not knowing
the value is a big is a big thing.

943
00:55:17,011 --> 00:55:19,410
It's kind of like, okay.
So back to my credit thing,

944
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:24,690
there is a point at the end where, okay,
so, um, you know, like, uh, I dunno,

945
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:29,170
10 years ago, whatever, I repaired
my credit, my credit was repaired,

946
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:34,350
I went through it was painstaking,
not fun stuff. Yeah. But I did it.

947
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:38,970
Got To credit repaired and now I know
the value because as an adult I'm

948
00:55:38,971 --> 00:55:41,280
functioning. It's useful now, you know?

949
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:44,070
So now I know the value of having good
credit because I've been through all the

950
00:55:44,071 --> 00:55:48,310
things that having good credit
brings you through, you know?

951
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:52,020
Now I'm thinking I'll never
go back to bed crying. Never.

952
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:53,460
It's worth it every single day.

953
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,410
I'm telling you that I agree
with what you're saying. Yeah.

954
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,330
I agree with what you're saying.

955
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:01,740
I'm saying that this guy knows the
value and that's why he wants it. Yeah.

956
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:06,420
It's like when you realize that you got
denied for something and you're like, oh,

957
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:07,980
vow credit has value.

958
00:56:07,981 --> 00:56:11,460
I understand that something happened in
his life where he said discipline has

959
00:56:11,461 --> 00:56:12,690
value.
I know that now.

960
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:16,830
But you did credit repair and
in what you said was, okay,

961
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:20,370
I need to go out and repair my credit.
You didn't say, Hey, you know what?

962
00:56:20,371 --> 00:56:24,040
My mom didn't tell me about bad credit
and now I have bad credit. Yeah. Yeah. So

963
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,010
now, so now what am I supposed to do?
You know who repaired your credit,

964
00:56:27,011 --> 00:56:30,790
who repaired your credit? Well it was
a combination of my wife and I but,

965
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:33,240
but who repaired your credit?
It yeah, we did this stuff.

966
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,040
You took responsibility for it and said,
okay, I'm gonna get my credit card. You,

967
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:38,800
you talked to your wife because she's
smarter than you. And she was like,

968
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:42,490
Hey I will, I will help this.
But it was you that said,

969
00:56:42,491 --> 00:56:45,640
okay I got to get this
fixed and you got help.

970
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:47,860
But you knew to reach out for help,

971
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:51,280
but you're the one that ultimately
is responsible for it. Yeah,

972
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:52,480
you're right about that.

973
00:56:52,481 --> 00:56:57,130
Like I didn't like I didn't blame my
parents and then continue having that

974
00:56:57,131 --> 00:57:00,930
credit. Right. Like you
said, no I gotta get this,

975
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:04,780
this thing has credit, has
value, I need to fix it.

976
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:08,800
And you fixed it, you know, regardless
of where it came from regardless.

977
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:14,480
So w w w w you know, oh you
don't know how to work out. Cool.

978
00:57:14,481 --> 00:57:16,430
Then you go hire a personal trainer
cause you know it's going to,

979
00:57:16,431 --> 00:57:18,200
it's the right thing to do.
You know what I mean? Oh,

980
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:21,170
you don't know how to
repair your finances. Cool.

981
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,900
Go get a counselor that's going to
help you repair your finances. Oh,

982
00:57:23,901 --> 00:57:26,000
you're addicted to drugs or alcohol.
Okay,

983
00:57:26,001 --> 00:57:28,730
I'm going to go find a counselor or join
a group so I can get through that thing.

984
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,490
No one's going to hold your
hand and bring you into that.

985
00:57:31,491 --> 00:57:33,050
Any of those situations,
you've got to do it yourself.

986
00:57:33,051 --> 00:57:35,270
You've gotta have the discipline
to make it happen. Yeah.

987
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:39,893
Good.

988
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:46,660
Ah, number seven. Good morning.

989
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:53,070
Did you find that people in the
military mock those that emphasize the

990
00:57:53,071 --> 00:57:54,690
importance of good leadership,

991
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:59,850
who take leading and our responsibilities
seriously? What does that mean?

992
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:04,770
Mocking like the front of you? Yeah.
Like what? People in the military making,

993
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:09,780
making fun of you because
you take leadership super
seriously. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,

994
00:58:09,781 --> 00:58:12,510
yeah, yeah. Like you're this way
scout. This is an interesting question,

995
00:58:12,511 --> 00:58:17,511
so it makes me a little bit
nervous because my suspicion
is that this individual

996
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:21,420
might be going about being
a good leader the wrong way,

997
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:25,050
and if you go about it the wrong way,
people can take offense to it.

998
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:28,950
If you're the guy that goes around
telling everyone that you are a leader and

999
00:58:28,951 --> 00:58:30,030
you're trying to be great leader,

1000
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:34,020
people would take offense to that because
like you can't make that part of your

1001
00:58:34,021 --> 00:58:35,340
thing,
right.

1002
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:41,760
People that talk about the importance of
good leadership are they come across as

1003
00:58:41,761 --> 00:58:46,761
implying that they are good leader
and and that can be offensive,

1004
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,910
especially if you aren't quite as
good of a leader as you think you are.

1005
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,930
She run around like you don't
understand how important leadership is.

1006
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,850
Like just think about that
statement right there.

1007
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:02,010
You don't understand the
importance of leadership. Echo.

1008
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,860
I'll all of a sudden I'm basically telling
you like I'm a good leader and you're

1009
00:59:04,861 --> 00:59:05,490
not.

1010
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:08,100
When the reality is just the way I'm
talking proves that I'm not a good leader

1011
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:13,380
because I'm talking down to you. Yeah,
so we have a problem right there.

1012
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,980
And also
if,

1013
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:21,060
if you take leading and our
leading responsibilities,

1014
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,393
what does that actually mean?

1015
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:26,900
Does that mean that you can't
have any fun with your team?

1016
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,130
Does that mean you can't laugh at
yourself when you've made a mistake?

1017
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:38,010
Does that mean that you are trying so
hard to give off the impression that you

1018
00:59:38,771 --> 00:59:39,790
are a great leader,

1019
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:44,440
that it appears to everyone else that
you aren't really who you act like and

1020
00:59:44,441 --> 00:59:48,040
that your character is,
is disingenuous.

1021
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:50,560
Right?
If I'm,

1022
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:54,010
if I'm constantly trying to put up
this front that I'm the great leader,

1023
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:57,460
everyone starts looking at me thinking
that guy's not even, that's not,

1024
00:59:57,461 --> 01:00:00,670
that's not the real him. He's just
trying to rock around like, uh, like a,

1025
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:04,280
he's not true. Right? You think about it,

1026
01:00:04,281 --> 01:00:08,500
you're trying to build trust and as a
leader we are trying to build trust.

1027
01:00:08,501 --> 01:00:11,380
We talked to dick winters talking
about honesty being the most,

1028
01:00:11,381 --> 01:00:13,870
one of the most important traits of a,
of a leader.

1029
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:16,540
But if we're putting up
a facade and how we act,

1030
01:00:16,541 --> 01:00:20,950
that does not come across as honest
and that doesn't build trust. In fact,

1031
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:21,790
they build the opposite.

1032
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:23,953
And

1033
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,570
also if,
if,

1034
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:31,260
if you have to put up a leadership front,

1035
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:32,533
hmm.

1036
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,520
If you have to put up a leadership front.
In other words,

1037
01:00:36,521 --> 01:00:39,460
if sometimes you have to
act a certain way, fake it.

1038
01:00:39,461 --> 01:00:40,900
Going back to something earlier,

1039
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:44,860
if you have to act and fake like a leader,

1040
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:46,780
that means you might be,

1041
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:52,480
you might be insecure about
your leadership capability
and you will come across

1042
01:00:52,481 --> 01:00:54,220
as insecure and people
can sense that insecurity.

1043
01:00:54,221 --> 01:00:56,770
So that can be very problematic.
Also,

1044
01:00:56,771 --> 01:01:00,070
if you're so into being a good leader,

1045
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:06,100
that probably means that you
have issues giving up the reins.

1046
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:13,200
That means that you are
probably micromanaging because
you want to be a leader.

1047
01:01:13,681 --> 01:01:16,670
Do you want to prove to everyone that
you're a good leader and so you start

1048
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:20,150
micromanaging and no one wants
to follow a micromanager.

1049
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:24,380
They don't want to do that.
And if you add

1050
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:30,830
all these things together,
what do people end up doing?

1051
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:33,890
They end up mocking.
You

1052
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:39,350
may end up mocking the things
that you think are important,

1053
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:43,010
like leadership itself.
They start to make fun of it.

1054
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:44,193
[inaudible]

1055
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,880
it's, Oh man, the, it's like the needle.

1056
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:52,570
I think his name is needle
Meyer in animal house,

1057
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:55,860
isn't it the right name?
I don't know. I kind of,

1058
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:59,020
I'm doing a movie reference and you're
not in with me. This is messed up.

1059
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:01,990
I can give you the John Belushi.
That's all you know. So there's,

1060
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:07,060
it's like the leader, the the ROTC
guy. He's the guy that's like Mr leader

1061
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:13,030
and everyone makes fun of him. Yeah,
he's trying to be a great leader.

1062
01:02:13,031 --> 01:02:16,390
He's trying to be the authoritative
figure. Everyone is making fun of him.

1063
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:19,560
So you have to be careful in case

1064
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:24,660
I would recommend you move to
the center a little bit more.

1065
01:02:24,661 --> 01:02:27,450
Meaning that on the one hand you have a
leader that isn't building relationship,

1066
01:02:27,451 --> 01:02:30,660
isn't building trust, expects people
to do as they're told and and treat,

1067
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:33,300
treat that leader with respect to,
even though they haven't earned it,

1068
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:36,630
that's not a good leader.
On the other hand,

1069
01:02:36,631 --> 01:02:38,760
you have leaders that are
too close with the troops,

1070
01:02:38,761 --> 01:02:43,290
has very personal relationships
to personal relationships
with the team and has

1071
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:47,490
lost any semblance of authority over
the team. So there's your two extremes.

1072
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:49,050
You want to be balanced in the middle.

1073
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:52,500
You want to build relationships with the
people you want to build your team up.

1074
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:58,400
And also forcing leadership on to people
does not work any more than forcing a

1075
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:06,411
religion or a diet or a workout or
a political breathe belief system.

1076
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:12,720
And can you make someone from a,
from a leadership perspective,

1077
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,640
if you have a 40 over other people,

1078
01:03:14,641 --> 01:03:18,750
can you make someone bow down to your
program mechanically for a little while?

1079
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:24,010
Yeah, you can. You can. But

1080
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,060
if it's not from them,

1081
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:31,200
if they're not part of it willfully,

1082
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:36,690
it's not going to work
over time. So, you know,

1083
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:40,680
don't beat people up verbally
with your leadership lessons.

1084
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:41,703
Hmm.

1085
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:47,740
Don't make it your external religion that
you are forcing on people internally.

1086
01:03:49,551 --> 01:03:53,420
Yes, of course. Obviously Ma, I
always thought about leadership.

1087
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:58,880
I always thought about leadership,
but I wasn't barking it. And I don't,

1088
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:02,030
I don't even think,
I don't even think

1089
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:08,780
like my best. The people that
taught me the most about leadership,

1090
01:04:08,781 --> 01:04:12,140
they never said a word to
me about leadership. Right.

1091
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:14,990
And I'm not saying that that's
the best course of action because,

1092
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:19,460
because sometimes it is good to, you
know, pull someone aside and say, Hey,

1093
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,980
this is the way you're acting right now
in front of your troops and that that's

1094
01:04:21,981 --> 01:04:24,570
not going to be effective.
Sometimes that is good. Yeah.

1095
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:26,780
Especially once you've
built the relationship.

1096
01:04:26,781 --> 01:04:28,880
Because if I don't have a relationship
with you, echo, when I say, Hey,

1097
01:04:28,881 --> 01:04:30,500
I need to talk to you.
Hey,

1098
01:04:30,501 --> 01:04:33,200
the way you're treating your guys right
now isn't going to go over very well

1099
01:04:33,201 --> 01:04:35,690
with them. What's your reaction going
to be? You're going to be pissed.

1100
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,900
You're gonna think of you don't know
my guys. I know them better than unit.

1101
01:04:38,901 --> 01:04:41,090
We're going to have a problem.
I D I. D I accomplished nothing.

1102
01:04:41,091 --> 01:04:45,290
My coaching and mentoring of you
was horrible cause we didn't have a

1103
01:04:45,291 --> 01:04:47,870
relationship.
So you're not listening.

1104
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:51,500
And obviously of course when I
started coaching and mentoring,

1105
01:04:51,501 --> 01:04:54,740
that implies that I'm the greatest
leader of all time. That's my,

1106
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:57,410
that's the implied statement
and you suck on great.

1107
01:04:57,830 --> 01:04:59,390
Which people reject that as well,

1108
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,730
especially when you're not that
great of a leader in the first place.

1109
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:07,820
So don't talk about it so much.
Just lead, be a good leader,

1110
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:12,660
open up discussions,
take a wrap off,

1111
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:18,080
come from the flank instead
of going straight on maneuver

1112
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:23,670
tactically and tactfully get into
their heads and make better leaders by

1113
01:05:25,301 --> 01:05:26,890
actually leading.

1114
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:29,373
Yeah.

1115
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:33,090
Yes. Of like that lead, you know,
lead by example kind of thing.

1116
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:37,170
It kind of makes you like the question
kind of how you said at the beginning,

1117
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:40,500
it makes you wonder.
He says,

1118
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:42,750
the question is do you find that
people in the military mock those that

1119
01:05:42,751 --> 01:05:47,250
emphasize the importance of good
leadership? You kind of think to yourself,

1120
01:05:47,251 --> 01:05:51,600
I wonder how this person is
emphasizing the importance of good.

1121
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:56,160
Is he the guy at the party who, you
know, people were talking about,

1122
01:05:56,161 --> 01:06:00,000
I don't know that the food or something.
Then he just bust out leadership stuff.

1123
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:03,660
You know that guy who's like
everything on like ROTC guy.

1124
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:09,160
He's just pushing it everyday. You know,
leadership has everything leaves you.

1125
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:10,800
If everything are bright.
We weren't even talking about that.

1126
01:06:10,801 --> 01:06:12,440
Leadership is everything kind of thing.
By the way,

1127
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:17,270
this is coming from a person in me that
I literally talk about leadership at the

1128
01:06:17,271 --> 01:06:20,700
time. Yeah. And, and I
actually think that way. And I,

1129
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:25,760
I get up on stage and in companies and
in front of military members and police

1130
01:06:25,831 --> 01:06:28,470
officers and, and I talk about leadership.
That's what I talk about all the time.

1131
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:31,710
Yeah. And that's what, you
know what's interesting,

1132
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:36,360
that's what makes about face by
Colonel David Hackworth. The,

1133
01:06:36,361 --> 01:06:39,570
one of the best things about that book is
it's not a leadership book. He doesn't,

1134
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,000
he just talk.
He barely talks about,

1135
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:45,810
he barely says a straightforward sentences
and use it. This is how you lead.

1136
01:06:46,350 --> 01:06:48,900
It's all from the flank.

1137
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:54,390
And that's why it gets you so
well because it's from the flank.

1138
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:57,420
Yeah. It's not a book about
leadership doesn't even say it. Right.

1139
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,390
You know how many books get
published publish all the time.

1140
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:04,560
You know that this is a leadership book.
I wrote a book with life.

1141
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:10,410
How to lead and win. Yeah. Hackworth
did it better Hackworth like,

1142
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:15,150
oh, this is about war.
Read it. Yeah. Yeah.

1143
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:18,850
In a way a day. I think we've seen.
But obviously that's your job.

1144
01:07:18,851 --> 01:07:20,790
So I guess my point is that if you're,

1145
01:07:20,791 --> 01:07:23,700
if this is coming from someone who
talks about leadership all the time,

1146
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:26,850
literally wrote a book about
leadership. Yeah. And I'm saying, Hey,

1147
01:07:26,851 --> 01:07:31,530
you might not want to talk about that.
That's my point. That's my point. Yeah.

1148
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:36,390
Good point. Just just, just back off a
little bit. Yeah. So if you were like,

1149
01:07:36,391 --> 01:07:39,060
you know, you go on the road,
you do one a year, you know,

1150
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:41,760
with your deals and then you know,

1151
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:45,420
at dinner with your family,

1152
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:49,800
you start going into your
leadership stuff with them.

1153
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,620
That's what you shouldn't
hear. Yes, yes. But I'm,

1154
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,010
what I'm saying is with your team,
with your platoon,

1155
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:01,110
you don't sit there and say,
all right,

1156
01:08:01,111 --> 01:08:03,330
today we're going to talk
about leadership again. Yeah.

1157
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:06,450
You don't quote unquote emphasize the
importance of good leadership. Right.

1158
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:11,470
You demonstrate it. You just lead.
They're smarter than you think. They're,

1159
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:14,850
you know what you're in to do and
you're kind of condescending. Yeah.

1160
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,970
You help it cause you're treating
them like they don't know.

1161
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,740
You want to talk about the importance
of leaders if they know what the

1162
01:08:18,741 --> 01:08:21,890
importance of leadership there
in the military. Yeah. In fact,

1163
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:27,680
an example of their reaction
of how people take it.

1164
01:08:27,681 --> 01:08:31,190
When you start preaching to them, you
know how they take it, they mock you.

1165
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:35,720
That's a lesson learned. That's a lesson
learned. If people are mocking you,

1166
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:40,040
they're not taking you seriously. Yeah.
That means you're doing something wrong.

1167
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:44,120
What you're doing wrong in this case
is your condescendingly talking to them

1168
01:08:44,121 --> 01:08:45,380
about the importance of leadership.

1169
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:48,710
They know what the importance
of leadership is. Yeah.
They're in the military.

1170
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:52,370
They know how bad it is to have a bad
platoon sergeant or a bad platoon,

1171
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:57,500
a platoon commander. They know you
don't need to rub it in their face.

1172
01:08:57,830 --> 01:09:01,610
Yeah, I remember, I think I told you
the story about one of my friends,

1173
01:09:01,611 --> 01:09:04,970
I'm not gonna name the name cause I'm
certain, you know he's a navy seal.

1174
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:07,220
We were at a party and he got,

1175
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:12,280
he got drunk and he's sitting at the
table explaining to all of us how bad ass

1176
01:09:12,711 --> 01:09:16,040
navy seals are. Yeah. Like for
a long time too. This is the,

1177
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,590
and he even said those words,
maybe you still just so bad ass,

1178
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:20,900
like we're so bad at and this
is why and all this stuff.

1179
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,230
And it's the exact same thing because
we know navy seals are bad ass,

1180
01:09:24,231 --> 01:09:29,231
but you sitting here telling us how bad
ass you and all navy seals are is going

1181
01:09:29,971 --> 01:09:32,930
to make us mock you a little bit. Going
to get mocked. Yeah. Even a little bit.

1182
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:35,540
You're gonna get mocked a lot. You're
going to get mocked by other navy seals,

1183
01:09:35,541 --> 01:09:39,170
by the way. For sure. Doing
that stuff. Anyway, check. Well,

1184
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:42,230
I'm glad that this guy
is asking the question.

1185
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:47,350
I'm glad that the guy is
focused on leadership and I
hope that these points can

1186
01:09:48,261 --> 01:09:52,610
come across and be digested with no.

1187
01:09:53,330 --> 01:09:56,360
Um, you know, there's real easy to get
offended by what I'm saying, right.

1188
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,060
If you're him, you like, well, you just
doesn't get it. You know what I mean?

1189
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:03,130
It's real easy to say that.
Yeah. We used to do yo, Yo,

1190
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:04,830
it's easy for him to say he doesn't
know what he's talking about.

1191
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:07,220
I'm the one that's here. I'm trying to
get these guys to be better. You know,

1192
01:10:07,221 --> 01:10:09,620
I'm trying to get my book too, and
understand the importance of leadership.

1193
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:11,750
I know, man. I know, and I respect that.

1194
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:15,140
I liked the fact that you're have
that mindset, man. That's all true.

1195
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:19,610
That's awesome. That's awesome.
Come from the flag a little bit.

1196
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:22,850
Come from the flank, man. You're
not gonna. You're not gonna.

1197
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,000
You're not gonna get that.
Get it done this way. Yeah.

1198
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:27,703
Yeah.

1199
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:31,970
It's Kinda like if you try to convince
everyone that you're the most humble

1200
01:10:31,971 --> 01:10:36,680
person in the world, you know, nobody
more humbling me. I'm the most humble.

1201
01:10:36,681 --> 01:10:38,840
I'm humbler than that guy.
I'm a humbling then you,

1202
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,030
I'm home earlier than anyone
through that who've ever lived.

1203
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:43,990
I'm just the most humble guy in the world.
Just doesn't work like that.

1204
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,510
That doesn't work that well.
X question,

1205
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:52,340
Jocko.
How do you lead a team of volunteers?

1206
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:58,160
How to punish or discipline them?
Can't threaten to fire them

1207
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:01,100
because they're all I have.

1208
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:05,070
I know a leader does so much
more than threatened and punish,

1209
01:11:05,071 --> 01:11:07,490
but I need some guidance.
Try to motive,

1210
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:11,010
try to motivate but feel
the need to do more things.

1211
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:13,980
Trying to answer this one quickly once,
cause this is kind of a,

1212
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:16,530
a question I've answered
before in a different form. Um,

1213
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:20,100
do they understand why they're doing
what they're doing and do they understand

1214
01:11:20,101 --> 01:11:24,480
why it's important? Do they understand
how what they are doing will benefit them?

1215
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:30,230
Do they also see you working hard
to try and make things happen?

1216
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:33,360
So those are,
those are just the basic questions.

1217
01:11:33,361 --> 01:11:35,370
Let's just get those out there every time.

1218
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:37,710
Every time someone's not doing
what you want them to do.

1219
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:40,560
Do they understand why they're
doing what they're doing?

1220
01:11:40,561 --> 01:11:43,620
Do they understand why it's important to
the mission and do they understand how

1221
01:11:43,621 --> 01:11:46,200
being successful in the mission
and will benefit them? So,

1222
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:50,010
so let's just get those out of the
way. Next. What can we do here?

1223
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:54,420
Have you game a five the situation at
all? How do you like that gamified, right?

1224
01:11:54,421 --> 01:11:55,530
Have you gamified the situation?

1225
01:11:55,531 --> 01:11:57,540
Cause I realize that's a term
that's getting thrown around now,

1226
01:11:57,541 --> 01:12:01,590
but we would gamify stupid things all
the time in the seal teams to make them

1227
01:12:01,591 --> 01:12:06,270
fun. Right. How much brass can you pick
up? Let's see. I'll pick up more than you.

1228
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:08,580
My squad will pick up more breasts and
you'll pick up all of the sudden we were

1229
01:12:08,581 --> 01:12:09,990
running around the range
trying to pick up brass.

1230
01:12:09,991 --> 01:12:12,430
One of the most miserable things that you
have to do in the seal teams is pickup

1231
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:17,280
brass off the hot range and
the summertime. And you do
it for, for like two days.

1232
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:18,780
Because once you get
done with all your work,

1233
01:12:18,781 --> 01:12:23,781
you've got to go pick up millions of
rounds of brass spread out all over the

1234
01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:28,860
Desert Inn in August in the
imperial valley. It's odd.
It's socks. But guess what?

1235
01:12:28,861 --> 01:12:31,240
We're going to do,
have a contest know.

1236
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:33,940
So what are you going to
do to game a fight? Uh,

1237
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:38,990
like what kind of cool competition around
some short term goal can you set up

1238
01:12:39,931 --> 01:12:43,770
that's going to be, it's going to make it
fun for them. Some kind of cool reward.

1239
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:49,260
What about some kind of friendly bets
around achieving something like I bet if I

1240
01:12:49,261 --> 01:12:51,300
raise this much money,
you know,

1241
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:54,630
I will go to work with a pair of
underwear on my head or you have to,

1242
01:12:54,631 --> 01:12:56,370
you know what I mean?
Whatever these stupid bets,

1243
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:00,210
you know what we used to do
in the teams is we'd bet $1,

1244
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:05,250
one of my old running mates, we,
we, we had something like critical,

1245
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,780
I bet you $1.
Yeah.

1246
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:12,810
That was like the biggest bet you could
make because it's just, it's pure pride.

1247
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,570
So, you know, and then we'd,

1248
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:17,970
we'd always have fun if you are
collecting or if you're giving the dollar

1249
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,910
collecting the dollar was
just totally glorious.

1250
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:25,530
Giving the dollar was shame and shame.
So yeah, like you could add like, okay,

1251
01:13:25,531 --> 01:13:28,410
when you give me this dollar a,
it has to be in front of everybody,

1252
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:30,240
be you have to,
I don't know,

1253
01:13:30,241 --> 01:13:32,710
you have to do it well like
walking on your knees or something.

1254
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:36,240
Something to real, kind of demeaning.
But we didn't even have to do all that.

1255
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:41,100
Just give me and my resume if we
won or lost the bet and is like,

1256
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:45,540
you know, and, and you wouldn't even ask
for the money. You just look at them.

1257
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:48,210
And this buddy of mine,

1258
01:13:48,211 --> 01:13:51,360
he had of the most classic looks
when he'd give you the look,

1259
01:13:51,361 --> 01:13:54,690
when I lose a bet to me, he gave
me the look, I wanted to cry.

1260
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,120
He lost more than that.

1261
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,570
So maybe you make a bet for a
dollar and if that's not working,

1262
01:14:00,571 --> 01:14:02,540
okay now if that's not working,
if you can't game a five,

1263
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:03,420
if you can't have fun with it,

1264
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:10,290
maybe ask them while they're,
why they are there and figure out

1265
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:15,160
their motivation is for being there
and how you can tie that into something

1266
01:14:15,161 --> 01:14:15,994
concrete.

1267
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:20,890
And then also like you might have some
people at heart aren't really into this

1268
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:24,890
and then lower your expectations of this
particular group of people and gaunt

1269
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:26,290
recruits and people that
want to get after it.

1270
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:30,810
Makes Sense.
Yeah.

1271
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:36,220
Have some fun.
Fun goes along way.

1272
01:14:37,150 --> 01:14:40,690
Fun goes a long way.
Having fun doing things goes a long way.

1273
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,390
And the, and that praise
thing too. You know,

1274
01:14:42,391 --> 01:14:46,110
when you said like add like a reward or
something for, because a lot of times,

1275
01:14:46,111 --> 01:14:48,930
especially volunteers were so,
you know, and we all feel this,

1276
01:14:48,931 --> 01:14:51,990
like even at work you can have like
a super fun job, but you'll get,

1277
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:57,000
you'll people genital spe speaking tend
to get complacent in one way or another.

1278
01:14:57,450 --> 01:14:59,590
You know, when things are
routine or things are, you know,

1279
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:02,730
not as exciting or
whatever. Um, and you know,

1280
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:04,710
when you're volunteering and that happens,

1281
01:15:04,711 --> 01:15:07,590
it's kind of like you're not tied
there by a paycheck really, you know,

1282
01:15:07,591 --> 01:15:10,590
which is just, it's just a powerful
tie, you know, that people have to work.

1283
01:15:10,591 --> 01:15:13,200
It's like, yeah, I don't like my job, but
it pays the bills and paying the bills.

1284
01:15:13,201 --> 01:15:14,250
It's a big deal kind of thing.

1285
01:15:15,570 --> 01:15:18,930
So if you add that element of
excitement or fun or you know,

1286
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:20,880
little personal payoff
in one way or another,

1287
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,980
I think that helps a lot of
the time. Indeed. And that
tends to happen too. If the,

1288
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:28,500
if the Li, I'm not saying this person
is doing this or not doing this,

1289
01:15:28,501 --> 01:15:33,501
but like if they become kind of complacent
and not recognizing how much they,

1290
01:15:34,350 --> 01:15:38,710
they, they appreciate the volunteers, you
know? Like if they're just like, oh yeah,

1291
01:15:38,711 --> 01:15:41,160
this is just business as usual,
you know, thanks for coming in.

1292
01:15:41,161 --> 01:15:43,110
That's kind of it kind of
thing. And they, you know,

1293
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:45,090
then it just gets kind of kind of Blah,
you know,

1294
01:15:45,091 --> 01:15:48,460
like that there's not the payoff
that they used to have, you know?

1295
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:51,750
But if you can kind of keep that going,
keep them in the game.

1296
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:54,553
Next question.

1297
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:59,620
Do I need to keep training Jujitsu?
If I hate it?

1298
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:03,340
I mean, can I just live my life
the way I think it should be,

1299
01:16:03,341 --> 01:16:07,210
which is of health energy and become
becoming a force of nature as a doctor

1300
01:16:07,211 --> 01:16:08,080
without dreaming up,

1301
01:16:08,081 --> 01:16:12,160
have some invisible enemies on the
street that I've yet to come across in

1302
01:16:12,161 --> 01:16:17,161
preparing and spending my pittance of
wage of a wage on lessons that I hate in

1303
01:16:17,391 --> 01:16:20,290
every sorts of ways for
something that might be avoided.

1304
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:24,430
Physical clash if I learnt to use wit
and saving my money to move into a good

1305
01:16:24,431 --> 01:16:28,660
neighborhood and I've been successful
in preventing physical clashes to occur.

1306
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:34,600
I've learnt basic ways to escape the
amount I can run. I'm fairly strong.

1307
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:35,680
Isn't that enough?

1308
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:40,600
Okay. So yeah, bro

1309
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:47,170
Do. Jesse was not the meaning of life.
All right. And you did. Who has a lot of,

1310
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:51,580
I mean, I find Jujitsu very
enjoyable. I get a lot out of it.

1311
01:16:51,581 --> 01:16:56,420
Beyond physical training.
Beyond self defense.

1312
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:57,283
Yeah.

1313
01:16:57,790 --> 01:17:02,440
I get a lot out of it and I apply it in
all different sorts of realms in my life.

1314
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:06,500
But if you hate it
and,

1315
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:10,250
and you've learned some basic ways
to defend yourself, escape them out,

1316
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:15,050
maybe some basic guards type stuff then,
then okay.

1317
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:16,610
I mean then step away.
I mean,

1318
01:17:16,611 --> 01:17:18,700
you shouldn't be going through life
doing something that you hate. I,

1319
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:20,990
if I were you,
I'd still train occasionally,

1320
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:25,670
even if it's just like once every
two or three weeks, once a month,

1321
01:17:25,671 --> 01:17:27,440
just to keep some of the ideas fresh.

1322
01:17:27,441 --> 01:17:30,650
And also also there's always
the possibility that will
click in your head and

1323
01:17:30,651 --> 01:17:31,484
you'll realize there's,

1324
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:35,900
there's like a magical thing that
you could get out of the Jujitsu. Um,

1325
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:39,350
and it's kind of like waking up,
waking up at four 30 in the morning.

1326
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:43,470
That's what time I wake
up. And, and first of all,

1327
01:17:43,471 --> 01:17:48,300
I'm genetically predisposed to sleep
less than most people. And for instance,

1328
01:17:48,301 --> 01:17:52,770
we just had daylight savings
time and yeah, and so,

1329
01:17:52,771 --> 01:17:56,070
and I went to bed,
so I sat back my clock and it was,

1330
01:17:56,100 --> 01:18:00,090
it was like nine 40 at night, so it
went from 10 40 when I was going to bed,

1331
01:18:00,091 --> 01:18:03,330
I set back my clock and now it's nine
40 and I said, I'll call, you know,

1332
01:18:03,331 --> 01:18:08,310
I'll sleep extra hour.
We know what time I woke up,

1333
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:14,010
like two 48 and then I laid in bed saying,
no,

1334
01:18:14,011 --> 01:18:15,660
sleep more, sleep more,
sleep more. I couldn't do it.

1335
01:18:15,661 --> 01:18:19,830
So I got out of bed at three 30 but
that's, that's me. And, and, and that's,

1336
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:24,300
that's just me.
And it depends on what your schedule is.

1337
01:18:24,301 --> 01:18:27,030
It depends on what your
genetic makeup is for sleep.

1338
01:18:27,030 --> 01:18:28,240
And if you work the night shift,

1339
01:18:28,241 --> 01:18:33,241
then obviously you're working at four 30
in the morning or you're getting off at

1340
01:18:33,361 --> 01:18:35,760
war of work at four 30 in morning.
So this just doesn't work.

1341
01:18:35,761 --> 01:18:40,761
And I try and put that caveat on
pretty much everything that I say,

1342
01:18:41,071 --> 01:18:44,700
like my workouts to what I eat.
Um,

1343
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:47,080
everyone's a little bit different
and I like what I like and,

1344
01:18:47,230 --> 01:18:51,120
and I do what I do and it works for me
and you can try it then if you come up

1345
01:18:51,121 --> 01:18:55,150
with something that's better,
I'll listen to you. Um,

1346
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:59,610
and that's the same with Jujitsu,
man. If you hate it, then you know,

1347
01:18:59,611 --> 01:19:03,780
maybe it's not for you. And,
and, and you know what I,

1348
01:19:03,930 --> 01:19:08,880
what I truly think my true thought.
Is it beneficial for you? Yes it is.

1349
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:12,840
D should you stop doing
everything that you don't like,

1350
01:19:12,841 --> 01:19:14,850
but just because you
don't like it? No. I mean,

1351
01:19:14,851 --> 01:19:16,650
there's some things that you
should press on. Should you get it?

1352
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,280
Should everyone have a fundamental level
of knowledge of Jujitsu? It's very,

1353
01:19:20,281 --> 01:19:23,590
very beneficial.
But if you hate it and,

1354
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:27,780
and you've kind of come to that
conclusion, then don't do it.

1355
01:19:31,650 --> 01:19:32,483
Yeah.

1356
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:36,670
And, and, and I think also once
you give yourself that out,

1357
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:42,420
once you give yourself the out and you're
not forcing yourself to do it anymore,

1358
01:19:42,930 --> 01:19:47,070
it might open up your mind to actually
enjoy it and try it and not be miserable

1359
01:19:47,071 --> 01:19:50,550
about it. Yes. Yeah. That's what
actually what I was going to say.

1360
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:55,250
It's probably,
and I don't know easily this,

1361
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:59,940
some people don't like it straight up. My
God, I accept that. I know. I know. But

1362
01:20:01,650 --> 01:20:02,483
that being said,

1363
01:20:02,910 --> 01:20:07,050
there is a possibility
that the environment that

1364
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,750
this person worked,
that people train in.

1365
01:20:09,751 --> 01:20:14,010
Sometimes we'll make you not like it
and it's not necessarily the Jujitsu you

1366
01:20:14,011 --> 01:20:16,110
don't like. Sure. Not wound up that way.

1367
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:18,550
You don't like to do anymore
because you were kind of, you know,

1368
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:23,250
pushed in the wrong direction as far as
like what you do like and don't like.

1369
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:26,200
So you could try a different school, try
different, try different school. Yeah.

1370
01:20:26,290 --> 01:20:27,690
Like I said earlier today,

1371
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:30,270
some schools are really strict
and rigid and maybe that's,

1372
01:20:30,271 --> 01:20:33,750
but would be better for you. Some schools
are real wild and there's no control.

1373
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:37,290
Maybe that, that be a better school
depending on what your personality is. Uh,

1374
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:40,020
some people like that regimen and
environment. Yeah. Yeah, you could,

1375
01:20:40,021 --> 01:20:42,690
you could definitely try a different
school. Uh, but again, I think,

1376
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:47,750
I think the mental hurdle to come over
is you've told yourself that you have to

1377
01:20:48,151 --> 01:20:50,340
do it and now tell yourself you don't
have to do if you don't want to,

1378
01:20:50,490 --> 01:20:52,740
but certain in,
and you say try different school.

1379
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:55,560
It's the environment that you train in.

1380
01:20:55,561 --> 01:20:57,450
So the school is part of
the environment for sure.

1381
01:20:57,510 --> 01:20:59,520
But it's like trading partners.
It's like the,

1382
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:04,650
which can wind up as the pressure you
put on yourself. It's like everything,

1383
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:09,140
you know, the whole environment. So I know
that. And people are different people.

1384
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:12,150
Some people, they want that pressure. They
want people yelling and you don't like,

1385
01:21:12,151 --> 01:21:14,370
remember I used to tell you
like when you start coaching,

1386
01:21:14,371 --> 01:21:16,080
either me just in training,

1387
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:18,660
you know like you'll get fired up when
you see two people training and whatever

1388
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:20,960
and you'll be like, do this,
do that. And you'll start code.

1389
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:23,970
It's almost like you're like as a friend,

1390
01:21:23,971 --> 01:21:27,300
you're doing it just for fun
and you're like, okay, do this.

1391
01:21:27,301 --> 01:21:31,920
And you usually coach up the other guy
when I'm rolling with him and that other

1392
01:21:31,921 --> 01:21:33,690
guy,
oh he's getting coached by Jocko.

1393
01:21:33,690 --> 01:21:37,710
So he turns up the heat and I don't like
that because it's now it's like a thing,

1394
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:41,490
you know, I don't like that at
all. But some people do like that.

1395
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:44,610
Some people that get them
fired up, it gets them more
in the game, you know? So to,

1396
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:45,870
I'm saying people are different.

1397
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:51,230
So the possibility is that this guy
happens to be in the wrong environment for

1398
01:21:52,111 --> 01:21:55,530
Jujitsu first for hip, for Jiu
Jitsu. For himself. Yes, exactly.

1399
01:21:55,531 --> 01:21:59,160
So it was a possibility. And
just like you said, you know, he,

1400
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:01,590
he could very well be putting
that pressure on himself.

1401
01:22:01,591 --> 01:22:04,650
Like you have to go and everyone's
saying how great it is and it's the best

1402
01:22:04,651 --> 01:22:06,270
thing.
And if you don't show up to practice,

1403
01:22:06,271 --> 01:22:08,510
you're whack and you're
lame or get on the texture.

1404
01:22:09,830 --> 01:22:12,540
If you get told all the time
it's the best thing in the world.

1405
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:15,030
And then you show up
there and you get beat up,

1406
01:22:15,031 --> 01:22:19,020
which is what happens and now you're like,
how does everyone likes this?

1407
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:22,230
This doesn't feel good to me. And you
just go in a negative mindset right away.

1408
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,750
So you guys should be careful of that.
And that's not dimension.

1409
01:22:24,751 --> 01:22:29,160
When you even imply that
you don't necessarily like
it. Oh yeah, cause you suck.

1410
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:33,570
Oh yeah, because you're this or you're
weak or you're whatever. You're a slacker.

1411
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:35,610
Like basically all this negativity,
you know,

1412
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:39,790
it's going to turn you off even more
so now. Yeah. You paid it now, which,

1413
01:22:39,791 --> 01:22:41,840
which there's the reality of it is some,

1414
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:46,590
some things don't agree with some
people, right? That's, that's a reality.

1415
01:22:46,591 --> 01:22:51,430
Like there's some things in the
world that, that I don't, I know,

1416
01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:56,010
I just don't like them.
Like when we were driving to La,

1417
01:22:56,490 --> 01:22:59,410
you're playing some music.
Some of the music that you're playing is,

1418
01:22:59,411 --> 01:23:03,820
is popular music. I just don't
like it. I just don't like it.

1419
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:06,153
And

1420
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:07,990
there's other things
like that in the world.

1421
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:11,980
I'm trying to think of things that I just,
just like other people like them. Yeah.

1422
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:17,070
And I just don't like them. I just don't
Pokemon go. That's one thing. Yeah.

1423
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,540
I mean, I don't, I've never
even thought about Pokemon go.

1424
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:22,900
It seems like a cool idea.
You got, you look for things
on your phone. I mean, well,

1425
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:26,170
I'm not, that's not the type of
thing that I'm talking about. Um,

1426
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:32,140
you know, I guess dancing at the
club. No, I mean, I don't care about,

1427
01:23:32,141 --> 01:23:33,640
I'm trying to think of something that's,
um,

1428
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:39,580
I guess music is the best is one
of the best examples for me is,

1429
01:23:39,610 --> 01:23:44,190
is, you know, hey, this certain types
of music, certain artists, yeah.

1430
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:47,200
Like Lafe,
Lafe likes hair.

1431
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:52,120
Lafe likes hair metal from the
90s he legit likes it. And, and I,

1432
01:23:52,121 --> 01:23:54,010
I like legit do not like it.

1433
01:23:54,290 --> 01:23:58,210
And the reason I used the reason that's
a good example is because that's not far

1434
01:23:58,211 --> 01:24:02,110
off from kind of the music that I do like.
I mean I like,

1435
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:07,180
I like led Zeppelin, I love led
Zeppelin, right. Led Zeppelin's awesome.

1436
01:24:07,910 --> 01:24:12,430
And, and the step from led
Zeppelin to, to, to poison.

1437
01:24:13,030 --> 01:24:17,530
I mean you could, you could be in the
same record category in the store, right?

1438
01:24:18,010 --> 01:24:21,750
Rock and roll led Zeppelin. I love, yeah,

1439
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:25,870
I poison kind of turns my stomach.
I hate it.

1440
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:31,210
And so that's an example of some things
they just don't sit well with you and,

1441
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:36,070
and maybe Jujitsu doesn't sit well
with this guy. Now I'm, like I said,

1442
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:38,410
I think there's a lot of benefits to it.
I think you get a lot out of it.

1443
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:42,820
Try a different environment. But if you
hate it, don't force yourself to do it.

1444
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,790
Open. Open the escape, right.

1445
01:24:45,970 --> 01:24:49,870
Give yourself an out and that
allows you to feel more comfortable.

1446
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:50,740
Cause when you feel trapped,

1447
01:24:50,770 --> 01:24:54,510
everyone feels like a cornered animal and
now you're just pissed off you. If you,

1448
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:56,200
if you've been like, hey
these guys, everyone,

1449
01:24:56,201 --> 01:24:59,530
I hear everyone talking about Jujitsu so
I'm going to try it and now your first

1450
01:24:59,531 --> 01:25:01,000
day you don't like it,
but you're like,

1451
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:04,330
I'm going to keep doing it
because everyone is saying
that's great and you just

1452
01:25:04,331 --> 01:25:06,730
ended up in a bad way.
So be careful with that one.

1453
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:10,570
You're kinda trapped it with it, with
the junk parts of it. Yeah. That,

1454
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:12,670
that kind of came about and yeah,

1455
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:16,300
and you can't really escape it
then you're like rebel against it.

1456
01:25:18,930 --> 01:25:22,900
Yeah.
Remember when we were driving up to la?

1457
01:25:22,901 --> 01:25:24,820
I was playing carry by Europe.

1458
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:28,840
That is actually technically
an eighties hair metal. Yeah.

1459
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:32,950
That's an easy yeah, for sure. But
you were really mad. Yeah. Yeah. No,

1460
01:25:32,951 --> 01:25:35,260
I'm telling you that music doesn't
sit well with me for some reason.

1461
01:25:35,290 --> 01:25:38,560
You got little bitty going back to life,
like lay likes Metallica.

1462
01:25:38,590 --> 01:25:42,880
Lafe likes black sabbath lay flags tool.
He likes rocking bands too.

1463
01:25:43,330 --> 01:25:46,630
For some reason. There's some genetic
code in his head that poisons cool. Yeah.

1464
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:50,890
Just lets it right in my and
gets the, and Holt. Yeah.

1465
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:53,650
But then I guess on the other
end of the spectrum you'd get,

1466
01:25:53,890 --> 01:25:56,830
we get into music that leaf and light,
like life likes Pantera.

1467
01:25:56,890 --> 01:26:00,550
Pantera was a hard band. Now I go one
step further than Penn. Tara. Right.

1468
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:04,100
Some of the music that I
listen to him, uh, which I

1469
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:08,150
think leaves Lafe a little bit where he
wouldn't listen to some of the harder

1470
01:26:08,151 --> 01:26:11,690
music that I listen to. But pantyhose,
you know, brushing up against it. Hey,

1471
01:26:11,691 --> 01:26:16,140
do you listen to soft music? Come on.
What do you consider soft music? I Dunno.

1472
01:26:16,190 --> 01:26:19,670
Something about love songs. I don't
know. So you don't let something soft,

1473
01:26:19,671 --> 01:26:22,640
do you know what I'm saying?
I'd say White Buffalo,

1474
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:26,520
White Buffalo is hard acoustic music.
But you know,

1475
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:30,080
he's got some pretty mellow songs.
He got a song called love song number one.

1476
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:33,420
What's it about though? Like is
he, is it like romantic, you know,

1477
01:26:33,421 --> 01:26:38,260
is he talked to you about
the girl or something like
that? I would say yes. Yeah,

1478
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:41,180
he kinda did the count cause
it's, you know, how like
what, how can that not count?

1479
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:46,070
No. Because you know how
like, like a Metallica for
example, they have unforgiven.

1480
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:49,850
Right. So it sounds softer, but they're
still talking about hard stuff. Okay.

1481
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:54,500
And then they have like interst hand man,
which is what I guess I'm just not,

1482
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:59,570
no my answer to use. No. Like do you
like what about led Zeppelin by one sec,

1483
01:26:59,571 --> 01:27:03,650
you're still talking about like, these
are soft things, like, you know, okay.

1484
01:27:03,710 --> 01:27:07,490
So I'll play an Algebra. Remember?
Remember Algebra? And you're like,

1485
01:27:07,491 --> 01:27:10,550
what the off this and you're pissed.

1486
01:27:10,580 --> 01:27:15,320
You are mad at me personally.
Like you and you were like,

1487
01:27:15,321 --> 01:27:19,850
who is this? No, no, no. You
know what though? Actually
I played another song. Uh,

1488
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:24,440
who was it? He was like Josh in or
something. And you're like, Hey,

1489
01:27:24,441 --> 01:27:29,180
this is pretty good. I was very surprised.
It was a soft song. Do you remember?

1490
01:27:29,350 --> 01:27:33,950
That's my musical. Tastes are varied.
Yeah. Different types of music. Yeah.

1491
01:27:33,951 --> 01:27:36,690
So I guess some types of
music that I don't like. Yeah.

1492
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:40,010
I sometimes wonder with you,
like if you're the kind of,
you know how some people,

1493
01:27:40,011 --> 01:27:43,490
they just, just, I like
music. I'm not saying me,

1494
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:47,450
I'm just saying certain people they
are into just a specific type of music.

1495
01:27:47,451 --> 01:27:47,840
That's it.

1496
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:51,440
That's the whole reason for music in
their head is like this very specific

1497
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:55,960
feeling. Like some people, um,
that I had know before they,

1498
01:27:55,970 --> 01:28:00,170
they only like house music. They don't
like anything other than the house.

1499
01:28:00,171 --> 01:28:03,590
Music is like, it's just the
old rather listen to nothing.

1500
01:28:04,190 --> 01:28:07,370
So I was wondering if you were like kind
of that kind of no where it's just all

1501
01:28:07,371 --> 01:28:12,080
different kinds of music. Yeah. Well at
least just not, maybe not all different.

1502
01:28:12,081 --> 01:28:16,850
Yeah. Okay. You're right. I listened
to a wide various types. Sure.

1503
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:21,710
There you go. Not Algebra
though. I forget the song,

1504
01:28:21,711 --> 01:28:25,790
but it was who we can refer back
to it later some other time. Cool.

1505
01:28:27,450 --> 01:28:29,650
All right. Next question. How about that?

1506
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:36,920
Dang. I kind of feel bad for the guy who
hates you. Do too. That's kind of crazy.

1507
01:28:36,940 --> 01:28:40,760
Yeah, it's a bummer, but it's, it's
not that rare. Yeah, it makes sense.

1508
01:28:40,761 --> 01:28:45,440
It totally makes sense. I was
actually talking with Dave real sure.

1509
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:46,910
I know who that is.
I don't know him personally.

1510
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:52,100
Well I was up with him up in San Francisco
area yesterday and we were talking

1511
01:28:53,871 --> 01:28:58,871
about how some people don't like Jujitsu
and you'd think even people that are

1512
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:01,980
you would think would like to Jitsu people

1513
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:06,600
that have jobs that Jujitsu would be
really beneficial for them to know.

1514
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:10,680
They don't like Jujitsu. Yeah. And so,

1515
01:29:10,730 --> 01:29:14,490
and I was saying that I've introduced
a lot of people to Jujitsu,

1516
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:16,770
a lot of people to Jujitsu.

1517
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:21,570
Not many of them have actually stuck
with it for a long period of time and,

1518
01:29:21,610 --> 01:29:26,610
and so it's not that rare for
people to not like Jujitsu.

1519
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:30,050
Yeah. And I, I dig, it's like not
sticking with it. Cause did you do that?

1520
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:30,570
Takes work.

1521
01:29:30,570 --> 01:29:34,860
It's not like the easy thing that provides
discipline is a difference between

1522
01:29:34,861 --> 01:29:39,390
not like in Jujitsu and not
actually sticking with it.
Yes. This guy straight up.

1523
01:29:39,391 --> 01:29:43,740
I hate it. That's a little bit
more powerful statement. Yeah.

1524
01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:47,220
It's like definitely doesn't like people
who don't stick with it for the most

1525
01:29:47,221 --> 01:29:50,520
part, this is just a total guess on my
part or lazy and lack discipline. Yeah.

1526
01:29:50,521 --> 01:29:51,430
Like they,
they just,

1527
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:54,830
they, they, they don't
like it enough on an,

1528
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:59,510
on a kind of moment to moment basis to
get off the couch and go. That's kind of,

1529
01:29:59,650 --> 01:30:02,060
you know,
it's one of those situations.

1530
01:30:03,710 --> 01:30:07,940
Next question Jocko.
I have a question after reading your book,

1531
01:30:08,330 --> 01:30:12,860
which I thought was one of the best books
I've read since your last book. Nice.

1532
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:14,900
I'm curious what,

1533
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:18,890
what you did during your seal
team days to maintain your,

1534
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,590
your schedule as I would
imagine in the teams,

1535
01:30:21,591 --> 01:30:25,790
your schedule changes at any minute to
include you being deployed or active

1536
01:30:25,791 --> 01:30:30,380
during your various missions at night.
So as in life,

1537
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:34,550
how do you keep your balance of your
schedule when duty calls in your book,

1538
01:30:34,551 --> 01:30:37,070
you say keep your schedule,

1539
01:30:37,130 --> 01:30:42,130
but how did you work through this when
you would be on a mission that didn't

1540
01:30:42,681 --> 01:30:44,810
allow you to sleep at night?
Did you still,

1541
01:30:45,170 --> 01:30:49,070
did you still the following day upon
return, maintain your normal schedule,

1542
01:30:49,470 --> 01:30:50,770
appreciate your time and response.
Great.

1543
01:30:51,390 --> 01:30:51,660
Yeah.

1544
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:55,500
Obviously the teams that you're scheduling
the teams can vary a lot and you have

1545
01:30:55,501 --> 01:30:58,890
to adopt to what makes sense. And
sometimes in the teams you're working 18,

1546
01:30:58,891 --> 01:31:02,100
20 hour days. Sometimes out in the field
you're going in the field for two, three,

1547
01:31:02,101 --> 01:31:03,300
four,
five days at a time.

1548
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:09,000
Sometimes you're working for 24 hours
a day or you work for 36 hours straight

1549
01:31:09,001 --> 01:31:11,760
because you do planning in the blah,
blah, blah. So that can be wrong.

1550
01:31:11,761 --> 01:31:13,350
But sometimes you're doing dives,

1551
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:17,640
you're doing two dives a day and that
takes a bunch of time and it takes a toll

1552
01:31:17,641 --> 01:31:21,390
on you. It's hard work I
guess you could say. Um,

1553
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:25,380
sometimes we're running around all day
or all night running around the desert,

1554
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:28,080
running around the
urban training facility.

1555
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,570
And so the schedule is
changing all the time.

1556
01:31:30,660 --> 01:31:33,480
And it's the same thing with business.
The same thing with business.

1557
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:35,980
Right now I travel on the flight
leaves early in the flight leaves.

1558
01:31:36,010 --> 01:31:38,520
He doesn't work all day or the dinner
with the clients or the interview or the

1559
01:31:38,521 --> 01:31:39,354
writing or the,

1560
01:31:39,390 --> 01:31:42,840
the recording of the podcast
or the changing time zones
and things just change.

1561
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:44,580
And so what I do is yes,

1562
01:31:44,581 --> 01:31:49,410
I try and I try and keep the schedule
as much as I can and if I fall off the

1563
01:31:49,411 --> 01:31:52,560
schedule for whatever reason, I get
back off on it as quickly as possible.

1564
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:56,280
And I think so. So yes,
you do the best you can.

1565
01:31:56,550 --> 01:31:59,500
I think the main thing you have
to watch out for is letting,

1566
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:01,570
letting a change in schedule

1567
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:07,780
or a problem in your schedule being
an excuse to fall off the path.

1568
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:11,870
Right? That's what you have to watch
out for. Um, you know, we think, oh,

1569
01:32:12,190 --> 01:32:15,820
I'm in a new time zone or I've got jet
lag or I didn't sleep well or I need rest

1570
01:32:15,821 --> 01:32:19,480
from traveling or I did this the other
night and saw I'm going to sleep until

1571
01:32:19,481 --> 01:32:22,090
nine 30 tomorrow morning
and just call it good.

1572
01:32:22,510 --> 01:32:24,190
That's what you have to
watch out for now sometimes.

1573
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:27,490
Do you need to work to ninth did you
sleep til nine 30 yeah. Sometimes you do.

1574
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,710
Sometimes you stayed up for 36 hours.

1575
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:32,830
You go to bed at three o'clock
in the morning, guess what?

1576
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:38,050
You might need to sleep until
nine 30. That's cool. Good.
Do it. Get some sleep. Um,

1577
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:43,320
but just be careful of using it as an
excuse to go way off the path and just get

1578
01:32:45,461 --> 01:32:49,960
yourself back on the path as soon
as possible. Yeah. Make sense?

1579
01:32:50,290 --> 01:32:53,050
Yes, sir. Yeah, that's all me right there.

1580
01:32:53,051 --> 01:32:56,500
Like one little thing on my schedule
throws off on this whole day is gone.

1581
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:00,820
I'll do it tomorrow. He's
got to be careful that, uh,

1582
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:04,000
speaking to schedule,
I think we're about good for questions.

1583
01:33:04,001 --> 01:33:07,180
There's one more thing that I wanted
to close out with and you know,

1584
01:33:07,181 --> 01:33:08,020
I get a lot of,

1585
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:12,820
I get a lot of really great emails.

1586
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:14,110
I will get a lot of great

1587
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:20,590
messages through social media,
letters, written letters,

1588
01:33:20,790 --> 01:33:23,440
I get all those kinds of things
and I appreciate them all.

1589
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:25,930
I don't always respond to all
of them because there's, I,

1590
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:30,460
I physically cannot do it. Yeah.
And of course, you know, oh,

1591
01:33:30,461 --> 01:33:33,400
get someone to manage your social
media or whatever. I'm not doing that.

1592
01:33:34,570 --> 01:33:37,420
If you hear back from me,
you hear it from me,

1593
01:33:37,450 --> 01:33:42,450
not from somebody that I paid $10 an
hour to respond to my stuff and say,

1594
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:46,750
cool, get after it. Like
no, uh, not doing that. But

1595
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:50,380
you know, I get, I would get all
these things and I, I do read them.

1596
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:54,640
So if you send it, I read it. And so I
appreciate the feedback and everything.

1597
01:33:55,810 --> 01:33:58,030
I got one though that I,
that was good.

1598
01:33:58,060 --> 01:34:03,060
I wanted to actually wanting to read
on here because I felt that it not only

1599
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:08,680
said, hey, thanks for you know, the
podcast or whatever, thanks for the books,

1600
01:34:08,681 --> 01:34:09,260
whatever.

1601
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:13,870
It actually gave some pretty
good methodology and really
an inset into a mindset

1602
01:34:13,990 --> 01:34:17,680
that I think will help people
doing what they're doing.

1603
01:34:17,710 --> 01:34:22,180
So here we go. Mr Willick just wanted
to share a quick story with you.

1604
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:27,990
At 39 I had fallen into a 15 year
Rut of undisciplined alcoholism.

1605
01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:32,500
I was soft and heavy and wanted a change.

1606
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:37,270
Earlier this year I had started working
out three to four times a week in my

1607
01:34:37,271 --> 01:34:41,890
basement. I was trying and failing
to get a handle on my alcohol abuse.

1608
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:45,940
Every failure made the beast
seemed bigger and unbeatable.

1609
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:49,030
It was like I didn't have
control over my body.

1610
01:34:50,890 --> 01:34:55,600
I finished your book on a Monday night
and decided that I would get up early the

1611
01:34:55,600 --> 01:35:00,560
next morning and workout. I got
up and worked out. Not much,

1612
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:04,610
but I just wanted to do
something. Sit ups, pushups,

1613
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:08,990
15 minutes on the bike,
worked out twice, Tuesday,

1614
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:12,440
got up Wednesday and did it again.

1615
01:35:14,030 --> 01:35:18,470
Got To Thursday night on normal drinking
night and decided to try not drinking.

1616
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:23,900
Made it through Friday.
Same thing.

1617
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:27,920
Worked out morning and night, stayed
busy and stayed away from the drink.

1618
01:35:30,030 --> 01:35:34,320
Fought I should try and push it through
the weekend. Worked out Saturday morning.

1619
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:37,380
It took the rest of the weekend,
often stayed dry.

1620
01:35:38,970 --> 01:35:42,060
Monday morning I got up
and started two days again,

1621
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:47,100
made it through the week with 11 workouts.

1622
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:52,680
By the second week, I felt better
than I had in my entire life.

1623
01:35:53,740 --> 01:35:56,940
I was astounded that normal people
walked around feeling this good.

1624
01:35:58,470 --> 01:36:02,130
I guess not systematically
poisoning your body will do that.

1625
01:36:03,990 --> 01:36:04,741
On the fifth week,

1626
01:36:04,741 --> 01:36:08,100
I got a project at work that was going
to require traveling for the next eight

1627
01:36:08,101 --> 01:36:08,934
weeks.

1628
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:13,680
I was worried about overcoming
my triggers and road habits,

1629
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:19,650
but normal traveling evening was dinner,
watch cable and drink eight beers.

1630
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:23,880
To my surprise, the hotel
at a sweet gym. Cool.

1631
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:28,740
I'll just keep doing what I'm doing.
Then at the site I found out that weren't,

1632
01:36:28,770 --> 01:36:32,070
we would start work at 6:00 AM.
Damn.

1633
01:36:32,071 --> 01:36:34,650
That means I have to get
up at four to workout.

1634
01:36:36,790 --> 01:36:39,810
I'm 12 weeks into my traveling.
Two a days,

1635
01:36:40,170 --> 01:36:43,050
usually getting 11 to 12 workouts a week.

1636
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:48,120
They recently moved our start time to
7:00 AM so now I get an hour and a half in

1637
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:51,930
the morning and evening.
I'm 16 weeks clean,

1638
01:36:52,950 --> 01:36:56,730
dropped 30 pounds or more.
I haven't been on a scale in three weeks.

1639
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:02,760
34 waist jeans hanging off of me.
I sit up and pushed.

1640
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:07,780
Upsets went from 10 to 40 to 50 kettlebell
swings went from 35 by 10 to 50 by 15

1641
01:37:13,770 --> 01:37:18,030
I started to learn how to run as,
I haven't done it in 20 years.

1642
01:37:19,230 --> 01:37:22,230
Now after a day off,
I can do two miles without stopping.

1643
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:27,870
I do four to five miles on the treadmill
and nine miles on the bike besides the

1644
01:37:27,871 --> 01:37:32,310
sit ups, pushups,
kettlebells, core and weights.

1645
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:36,840
I look forward to next year's
competitive shooting season.

1646
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:40,110
I'm going to bring it at this point,

1647
01:37:40,111 --> 01:37:44,250
my cravings are gone and I actually
recoil from the smell of booze.

1648
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,420
When I started this,
I thought it would be temporary.

1649
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:54,480
Now it's going to be permanent.
No reason to waste time with it anymore.

1650
01:37:56,330 --> 01:38:00,890
Now when I questioned something, your
voice comes to me with the hard answer.

1651
01:38:02,490 --> 01:38:04,620
It's only black and
white with no gray area,

1652
01:38:06,170 --> 01:38:06,930
okay?

1653
01:38:06,930 --> 01:38:10,890
One day when I'm standing before the Lord,
Lord and hear his voice,

1654
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:13,620
if it doesn't sound like yours,
I might be disappointed.

1655
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:21,180
The book I read those months ago
was the way of the war. Your Kid,

1656
01:38:23,170 --> 01:38:25,000
I'm working on extreme ownership now.

1657
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:28,180
Thank you for your service.

1658
01:38:28,450 --> 01:38:33,450
Thank you for producing a bad ass podcast
and thank you for influencing my life.

1659
01:38:38,230 --> 01:38:42,100
So
there you go.

1660
01:38:44,060 --> 01:38:47,690
And I, I say this to
people all the time. Okay?

1661
01:38:48,430 --> 01:38:51,400
Most important here is it isn't me,

1662
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:59,430
it's you and sure you may have grabbed
some little foot hold from the podcast or

1663
01:39:00,431 --> 01:39:04,900
from one of the books, but it isn't
me. That changes you. It's you.

1664
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:07,453
Yeah.

1665
01:39:07,660 --> 01:39:12,160
You set the small goals,
you achieve those goals,

1666
01:39:12,340 --> 01:39:16,510
then set some more and achieve
those and set some more goals.

1667
01:39:16,511 --> 01:39:18,940
Maybe a little bit bigger
but not that much bigger.

1668
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:25,040
You pay attention to the progress.
This guy is 16 weeks deep,

1669
01:39:27,490 --> 01:39:32,290
30 pounds lighter, working
harder, stronger, faster,

1670
01:39:32,380 --> 01:39:34,330
more efficient,
competitive.

1671
01:39:37,430 --> 01:39:42,430
The individual that wrote that is
getting after it and changing his life.

1672
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,550
And you can't too.
Just start,

1673
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:52,780
just start small.

1674
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:57,420
Start with changing tomorrow morning.
Just tomorrow morning.

1675
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:00,610
Get that squared away.

1676
01:40:02,020 --> 01:40:02,853
Okay.

1677
01:40:02,860 --> 01:40:07,780
And then move on to the next day and
the next and move your life to a better

1678
01:40:07,781 --> 01:40:10,690
place.
One little step,

1679
01:40:13,210 --> 01:40:16,390
one little victory at a time.

1680
01:40:19,270 --> 01:40:20,200
Appreciate the letter.

1681
01:40:21,130 --> 01:40:25,120
And I think that's all
I've got for tonight.

1682
01:40:25,870 --> 01:40:30,640
So Echo speaking of people getting better,

1683
01:40:31,030 --> 01:40:33,130
stronger and faster

1684
01:40:34,690 --> 01:40:37,670
and actually supporting the podcast
if they want to do that. Sure.

1685
01:40:37,690 --> 01:40:41,320
Do you have any suggestions
for us? Sure, of course.

1686
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,670
I can talk about the fact that origin

1687
01:40:48,270 --> 01:40:52,280
has a new key coming out.
Good one.

1688
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:59,460
I don't know that the name
of the game. You know, geese
have names, you know, like,

1689
01:40:59,490 --> 01:41:04,150
okay, we'll origin does. Yup. Yup.
That's a cool name too by the way.

1690
01:41:04,151 --> 01:41:08,350
Axiom. But this one is called
I think discipline discipline,

1691
01:41:08,650 --> 01:41:11,680
I think it's called discipline
might be called discipline. Yeah.

1692
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:16,330
Not The discipline does just discuss
discipline. I that could be called that.

1693
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:19,060
Sure. You could check it
out. Origin main.com. Right.

1694
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:22,660
Surprisingly aesthetically

1695
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:28,640
great.
I would say it's,

1696
01:41:28,970 --> 01:41:30,620
I would say it's probably

1697
01:41:32,270 --> 01:41:35,630
is the term they use
like on brand on brand,

1698
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:40,490
meaning it kind of fit fits
your brand. Okay, sure.

1699
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:45,470
Let's say it does that. Yeah.
Yeah. It totally does it. Um,

1700
01:41:46,820 --> 01:41:50,090
it's like, yeah, it does.
It's not the kind of where,
you know how like some geese,

1701
01:41:50,091 --> 01:41:51,790
like you look at him,

1702
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:55,820
you can tell there's like all these bells
and whistles as far as decorations go.

1703
01:41:56,560 --> 01:42:00,310
That's a good word. Decorations.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, but
he was looking for decking.

1704
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:03,410
Right. Here's the thing though.
There are some, there are some, uh,

1705
01:42:03,470 --> 01:42:08,470
how should I say functional decorations
and now that's not actually a good word

1706
01:42:08,871 --> 01:42:11,680
for it anyway. It, it looks
cool. Put it that way.

1707
01:42:11,930 --> 01:42:16,190
It looks cool and it will basically um,
kind of lighter weight,

1708
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:21,400
one for functionality
but awesome nonetheless.

1709
01:42:21,580 --> 01:42:25,250
Uh, look at it. I got a white
one. I know you got the black one.

1710
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:29,190
How do you know I don't have both.
Yeah, I'm sure you do it both.

1711
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:33,770
I'm still working on the black one
but that's the long story nonetheless.

1712
01:42:33,771 --> 01:42:35,030
It's a good one.
And

1713
01:42:36,670 --> 01:42:39,310
a lot like back when we first
started everyone would ask them that.

1714
01:42:39,770 --> 01:42:43,590
I don't want to say everyone, but a lot of
people. Yeah. You know, I don't like to,

1715
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:48,590
it feels weird like yeah, a lot
of people, people, some people.

1716
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:51,870
But the thing is a lot of people though,
cause like a lot of people ask,

1717
01:42:52,670 --> 01:42:55,790
should I get, I'm making the
disclaimer. It was a lot of people,

1718
01:42:55,791 --> 01:42:57,180
it wasn't the kind of like, Oh, you know,

1719
01:42:57,200 --> 01:43:01,040
my little brother asked me once
and then ask me again. It was.

1720
01:43:01,430 --> 01:43:06,080
It's a lot of people
maybe two times a week,

1721
01:43:08,030 --> 01:43:10,910
two times a week for two years. By
the way, that's a lot of people.

1722
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:13,820
It's a decent amount of skin. The same
exact question. Anyway, they ask like, oh,

1723
01:43:13,821 --> 01:43:16,820
what can eat? Should I get? Or
whatever. Now there's like, yeah,

1724
01:43:16,821 --> 01:43:19,280
origin gies and then now
I'm saying get this one.

1725
01:43:19,490 --> 01:43:21,020
This is the one that's straight up.

1726
01:43:22,790 --> 01:43:25,700
I don't know that I'll wear any other key.
I'm not saying I won't.

1727
01:43:25,730 --> 01:43:27,740
I'm just saying I don't know that I,
yeah,

1728
01:43:27,970 --> 01:43:29,360
and actually I don't
know if you know this,

1729
01:43:29,361 --> 01:43:34,361
did you know that they're going to sell
this g and a certain number of them?

1730
01:43:35,270 --> 01:43:40,270
400 you're going to get a
copy of discipline equals
freedom field manual signed.

1731
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:46,790
I signed it, so if you want a signed
copy, you know g and yeah, that'd be cool.

1732
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:50,880
It's like a little little packages,
a little discipline package. Yeah.

1733
01:43:51,470 --> 01:43:51,980
If you end up

1734
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:55,910
hating Jujitsu, what do
you do to hang up? Hang up,

1735
01:43:55,911 --> 01:44:00,020
hang up the hin. Hopefully you don't hate
Jujitsu like that one. A question today.

1736
01:44:00,530 --> 01:44:04,920
Yeah. Hopefully you love Jujitsu, most
likely you'll love Jujitsu. Good. Yeah,

1737
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:07,760
hopefully. Yeah, if you're getting
the discipline equals freedom,

1738
01:44:07,761 --> 01:44:10,980
gay as a discipline equals freedom.
Get or just discipline.

1739
01:44:10,990 --> 01:44:14,970
Just be all the deaf geek. I Dunno. Well,
yeah, that's good. Deef disappointing.

1740
01:44:15,030 --> 01:44:18,710
Go through them. It's good. It's
embroidered as the American May. Yeah,

1741
01:44:18,770 --> 01:44:22,220
and it is made in America, like all
the words and stuff, but yes. Yeah,

1742
01:44:22,730 --> 01:44:25,790
that's a good one. Anyway,
look at Dalen get down.

1743
01:44:26,090 --> 01:44:28,650
If you're still looking for a GIG, get
down. Even if you're not looking for a,

1744
01:44:28,660 --> 01:44:32,570
you just look at this and pick worth.
He said on Twitter,

1745
01:44:32,690 --> 01:44:33,940
he's going to get the [inaudible].

1746
01:44:33,941 --> 01:44:38,390
You know he's not training
Jujitsu and then actually I have,

1747
01:44:38,420 --> 01:44:41,150
I didn't respond to Brandon,
but I'll respond right now.

1748
01:44:41,330 --> 01:44:43,580
Get the G and train Jujitsu.

1749
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:47,510
It's the kind of where he's gonna.
He's gonna by the way.

1750
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:50,720
He's going to get the GIG. It's
like, but then train Jujitsu or dude,

1751
01:44:50,930 --> 01:44:53,420
he's going to come on.
That's my bet.

1752
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:57,260
I almost am challenging
him to prove me wrong.

1753
01:44:57,261 --> 01:45:00,860
That's how much anyway prove to everyone
that he could do a hundred burpees and

1754
01:45:00,861 --> 01:45:04,400
10 minutes. It was a challenge for her.
It's hard for him, but he did it. Yeah.

1755
01:45:04,401 --> 01:45:07,150
And that was, he's a reasonable
challenge on the mat. Yeah,

1756
01:45:07,450 --> 01:45:09,830
he's gonna you can't just get
the gains when you put it on.

1757
01:45:10,190 --> 01:45:13,780
And this goes for pretty much any like
legitimate gay when you put it on your

1758
01:45:14,070 --> 01:45:19,070
tray. And this is true, like you
ever, um, like we, we did it in Maine.

1759
01:45:19,100 --> 01:45:23,880
Like it happens all the time when you
had you put on the gay just to grab,

1760
01:45:23,910 --> 01:45:28,830
I grab it. You're like, oh,
it's time, you know, kind of
thing. Same exact thing. Yeah,

1761
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:33,530
exactly. Right. Cool. And this
guy is no different. In fact,

1762
01:45:33,531 --> 01:45:37,700
it might even have that even
more that feeling. Yeah.

1763
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:42,230
Yeah. Good nonetheless. Um,
yeah, so it comes from origin.

1764
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:46,250
If you didn't already pick that part up.
Origin main.com.

1765
01:45:46,310 --> 01:45:47,420
There's a lot of Gisele in there.

1766
01:45:47,421 --> 01:45:52,421
Even if you want to get a another one
other than the you don't want to do.

1767
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:58,480
I have all the patches that you know how
like like Naco Nolan and they'll give

1768
01:45:59,961 --> 01:46:04,640
you these patches and stuff like that.
I'm going to have all of them on Maggie.

1769
01:46:04,820 --> 01:46:06,770
All of them.
How many do you have?

1770
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:10,450
About 12 cause I have like 90

1771
01:46:12,470 --> 01:46:15,860
I've got so many awesome patches from
fire departments, police departments,

1772
01:46:15,861 --> 01:46:20,450
military units all over the country.
Foreign. Yeah. I got a lot of stuff.

1773
01:46:20,810 --> 01:46:24,620
That would be a biggie. Yeah, you
got to put them on multiple. Jeez.

1774
01:46:24,890 --> 01:46:28,710
If you got the black and the white,
it wouldn't have enough room. Yeah.

1775
01:46:28,780 --> 01:46:31,340
Tan a lot of patches, bro. Yeah. Yeah.

1776
01:46:31,341 --> 01:46:33,170
And there's certain places
you can't really put them to,

1777
01:46:33,171 --> 01:46:36,440
so that even limits you more.
But I'm doing it.

1778
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:40,010
I'm starting it and if I run out of
space, I'm getting another geek. Boom.

1779
01:46:40,250 --> 01:46:44,150
I'm going to keep it going. I do
kind of risk people saying, hey,

1780
01:46:44,151 --> 01:46:46,460
you're not law enforcement.
Why are you wearing that patch?

1781
01:46:46,461 --> 01:46:50,100
Like some of those patches to me
seem like you, you give me a NASA

1782
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:53,790
one, like that's to shoot. Should
I be even wearing this patch?

1783
01:46:54,230 --> 01:46:55,650
We got friends at NASA,

1784
01:46:56,970 --> 01:47:00,720
I'm going to wear it and we'll say this
is from my friends at NASA. Great up.

1785
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:04,830
Anyway. Anyway, back to origin, origin.

1786
01:47:04,831 --> 01:47:09,750
That's all American made stuff from
the cotton out of the ground. American

1787
01:47:11,580 --> 01:47:15,480
to the factory. American
factory in America, in Maine.

1788
01:47:16,830 --> 01:47:19,830
Make the material, make the
clothing, make the gies,

1789
01:47:19,831 --> 01:47:24,120
make the rash guards make do.
What else do they have? Some bags,

1790
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:30,100
gym bags and whatnot. Accessories, I
believe they're called accessories. Yeah.

1791
01:47:30,150 --> 01:47:33,690
Like beanies and tee shirts.
All made in America. Yeah.

1792
01:47:34,110 --> 01:47:35,700
I think when I told Jordan Peterson that,

1793
01:47:35,701 --> 01:47:38,750
I think he liked it even though even
though he's not American. Yeah, yeah.

1794
01:47:39,090 --> 01:47:41,790
Still and and the supplements.
Yeah,

1795
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:45,480
from origin labs yet those
are Jocko supplements.

1796
01:47:45,990 --> 01:47:49,010
So here's the thing,
I'm going to,

1797
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:52,560
I'll go into the details later.
But Super Krill.

1798
01:47:52,561 --> 01:47:56,700
There is a legitimate difference between
Super Krill in regular Krill oil.

1799
01:47:57,240 --> 01:48:00,480
There is, and it's very beneficial.
I'm not going to say it right now,

1800
01:48:00,481 --> 01:48:04,140
but just know super
krill oil, Jocko, brand,

1801
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:09,570
joint warfare, Jocko brand
for your joints, supplements,

1802
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:13,230
boom. Jocko came out with it.
That's the stuff from the beginning.

1803
01:48:13,290 --> 01:48:17,310
That was the main supplements,
you know, joint stuff. Krill oil,

1804
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:20,240
you're the number one reason,
not even the number.

1805
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:23,670
And the only reason I started
taking it and I'm kind of mad.

1806
01:48:23,671 --> 01:48:27,480
I didn't take it before. Yeah. You were
behind and now you got your own one,

1807
01:48:27,481 --> 01:48:31,260
which is even better. Yeah, it's super,
it's super as a matter of paper. Yeah.

1808
01:48:31,470 --> 01:48:35,630
But it's not just a name though.
The joint warfare has, uh,

1809
01:48:36,090 --> 01:48:39,760
some magic in it. Sure.
In my opinion. Sure. And,

1810
01:48:39,860 --> 01:48:44,550
and in my shoulders opinion. Yeah.
Left shoulder both of my shoulders,

1811
01:48:44,610 --> 01:48:49,560
my back and my elbows. So yeah. Or
domain.com. That's the place to go.

1812
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:54,870
Also, some legitimate fitness gear.
Everyone knows I'm into kettle bells now.

1813
01:48:57,300 --> 01:48:59,910
I get mine from on it. They're the
cool ones. Straight up. That's it.

1814
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:05,430
I don't think I could go
back to regular kettlebells.

1815
01:49:05,780 --> 01:49:09,720
It's my opinion. The Werewolf
at the big foot, 90 pounds,

1816
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:13,110
two pounds heavier than Jockos
heaviest kettle bell. Every rep,

1817
01:49:13,770 --> 01:49:16,800
I think Jordan Peterson was impressed
with that too by the way. He was.

1818
01:49:18,030 --> 01:49:21,870
That makes one of us
also.

1819
01:49:22,650 --> 01:49:23,310
Oh sorry.

1820
01:49:23,310 --> 01:49:27,960
[inaudible] dot com slash
Jocko that's the one good spot.

1821
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:33,500
You know also good way to support
when you buy books that Jocko reviews,

1822
01:49:35,370 --> 01:49:37,770
I guess technically I kind
of had help review them

1823
01:49:39,330 --> 01:49:42,880
in a real kind of distant direct,
yes,

1824
01:49:42,930 --> 01:49:46,920
indirect way. Anyway, those books,

1825
01:49:47,260 --> 01:49:51,060
very compelling books when you get
them go through the website Jocko,

1826
01:49:51,061 --> 01:49:55,240
podcast.com little tab on the
top says books from podcasts.

1827
01:49:55,241 --> 01:49:56,770
Go through there by the
books through there.

1828
01:49:56,771 --> 01:50:00,610
That's a good way to support take you
to Amazon shop. Just the way you know,

1829
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,430
prime one day shipping,

1830
01:50:03,490 --> 01:50:05,370
Just like anything else
but go through that.

1831
01:50:05,371 --> 01:50:10,060
It's a good way to support and do any
other shopping you have to do. Carry on.

1832
01:50:10,630 --> 01:50:14,320
Good way to support. Also subscribe

My iPhone has stitcher.

1836
01:50:26,910 --> 01:50:31,320
Oh wait, no. Android doesn't
have a l s I don't know.

1837
01:50:31,470 --> 01:50:34,770
Apple. Yeah. I don't think you
could listen to it. I don't. Maybe,

1838
01:50:34,980 --> 01:50:37,740

Also subscribe to it on Youtube.

1842
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:53,250
The video version of this
podcast is a good one still,

1843
01:50:53,251 --> 01:50:56,880
and I still do get the
whole thing like, oh, echo,

1844
01:50:56,881 --> 01:51:01,160
you don't look like you sound.
And I remember it.

1845
01:51:01,161 --> 01:51:04,830
Change the way you talk. Yeah.
Yeah. Or change the way I look.

1846
01:51:05,060 --> 01:51:08,310
I don't give her no. Get skinny. Yeah.

1847
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:13,890
Get less jacked. That is it.
It's kind of an intuitive thing.

1848
01:51:13,891 --> 01:51:18,891
Youtube comments like one out of every
20 youtube comments is Echos Jack.

1849
01:51:21,700 --> 01:51:23,280
Yeah,
that's flooded.

1850
01:51:23,490 --> 01:51:27,240
It kind of is because you wouldn't think
that you could determine what someone

1851
01:51:27,241 --> 01:51:29,910
looks like by what they sound like.
But it feels like you can,

1852
01:51:30,390 --> 01:51:32,720
I think a lot of times you can.
I don't know though,

1853
01:51:32,730 --> 01:51:36,570
actually now that you think about like
talk show hosts on radios. Yeah. Yeah.

1854
01:51:36,571 --> 01:51:39,630
You don't know what yeah, it's kind
of can't I guess it's uh, it's, it's,

1855
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:43,480
it's harder to do than you think.
Yeah. If feels like you can't. Yeah.

1856
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:46,320
If someone has like a d, I
dunno, like a deep voice.

1857
01:51:46,321 --> 01:51:49,380
You think they're huge or something
or you know, like something like that.

1858
01:51:49,410 --> 01:51:53,880
Not necessarily true. Yeah, not true
at all. Remember that Seinfeld One?

1859
01:51:54,150 --> 01:51:58,290
No, they're there. The guy who
was like, she, I think Elaine,

1860
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:00,630
who's the girl in there?
[inaudible] she was like, oh,

1861
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:03,630
he had a good looking voice or something.

1862
01:52:03,631 --> 01:52:06,060
Like he sounded like he was good
looking or something like that.

1863
01:52:06,120 --> 01:52:08,940
How'd it turn out at the,
I don't know. I forget.

1864
01:52:08,941 --> 01:52:13,650
I think he was telling that story.
You remember it? Yeah. The analogy,

1865
01:52:13,651 --> 01:52:17,880
I didn't remember it, but it reminded
me of that nonetheless. Anyway,

1866
01:52:19,290 --> 01:52:21,660
youtube subscribe to Youtube.
That's the point there.

1867
01:52:21,810 --> 01:52:24,030
Regardless of if you want to
know what I look like or not.

1868
01:52:24,150 --> 01:52:27,690
Doesn't even matter what I
look like. Really? Barely.

1869
01:52:28,020 --> 01:52:33,020
Maybe a little bit I guess maybe I see
because if I see you out in the wild,

1870
01:52:34,490 --> 01:52:35,250
it'll you know,

1871
01:52:35,250 --> 01:52:38,490
we can recognize each other if you
know what I look like beneficial.

1872
01:52:39,510 --> 01:52:43,140
There's times when people will recognize
you and your like say, Oh yeah,

1873
01:52:43,141 --> 01:52:43,980
this is Echo Charles.
Ian,

1874
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,490
you can tell on their face like are you
sure that this is talking to you though?

1875
01:52:47,690 --> 01:52:52,570
Kind of encountered that for sure.
For real like I know for sure.

1876
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:56,930
That's cool. I dig it but if you
want to avoid that kind of situation,

1877
01:52:57,440 --> 01:53:01,070
subscribe to Youtube, good way to
do it and could witness support.

1878
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:03,410
Also Jack was a store.

1879
01:53:03,990 --> 01:53:07,940
It's called Jocko store Jocko
store.com we have tee shirts on there.

1880
01:53:07,941 --> 01:53:11,630
If you want these tee shirts.
I'm wearing my good tee shirt right now.

1881
01:53:11,631 --> 01:53:14,060
I haven't worn this one anytime.
The original.

1882
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:19,700
That's really high quality
layers too by the way.

1883
01:53:20,090 --> 01:53:24,530
The good is backwards to look at in
the mirror. That message is for you.

1884
01:53:25,910 --> 01:53:29,790
If you think about the whole message of
good, I mean I know you said it, you know,

1885
01:53:30,110 --> 01:53:32,480
you know you were like good kind of thing,

1886
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:35,810
but you were kind of
like you guys had the,

1887
01:53:35,900 --> 01:53:38,660
the luxury of you being there
to be able to explain it.

1888
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:42,470
If someone's going through
like something hard, it's,

1889
01:53:44,030 --> 01:53:47,960
you can't just automatically just say
good. It kind of comes off kind of weird.

1890
01:53:48,590 --> 01:53:49,640
Yeah,
potentially.

1891
01:53:50,930 --> 01:53:54,470
That's why I put this backwards cause
it's like you tell yourself good.

1892
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:57,380
You see what I'm saying? That's the layer.
That's the little insight to the layer.

1893
01:53:57,381 --> 01:54:00,200
I'm not going to go deep and I'm not
going to go into any of the other

1894
01:54:00,201 --> 01:54:02,000
explanations for the other layers,

1895
01:54:02,001 --> 01:54:05,420
but just know that they have layers
on all the clothing on Jacqueline,

1896
01:54:05,421 --> 01:54:09,410
store.com check it out. I'm not saying
to buy something. I'm saying go on there,

1897
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:13,540
look on there. If you like something,
get something good way to support this.

1898
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:17,330
A women's stuff on their t
shirts. Like I said, some patches,

1899
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:22,010
rash guards for Jujitsu or
anything physical cycling,

1900
01:54:22,580 --> 01:54:27,410
anything requiring range of motion.
Maybe some compression situations.

1901
01:54:28,850 --> 01:54:33,050
Highest static value but not too high
because it's more about functionality.

1902
01:54:34,220 --> 01:54:38,630
That's my take on the whole deal. But
they do look good and they have layers.

1903
01:54:39,290 --> 01:54:43,460
Hoodies are in
being shipped out right now.

1904
01:54:43,490 --> 01:54:46,940
They're in heavy. Do you have
one? No, Dang girl. Sorry.

1905
01:54:49,490 --> 01:54:53,870
Well we are in California so you
know it's not that big of a deal.

1906
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:56,030
You know you got your old one,
it's all good.

1907
01:54:56,630 --> 01:54:57,980
But yeah there's some hoodies on there.

1908
01:54:58,340 --> 01:55:02,180
Some warrior kid's rash guards are coming.

1909
01:55:02,390 --> 01:55:06,230
Boom cause people have been asking me
about that cause I wore one that was like

1910
01:55:06,231 --> 01:55:08,500
a test one and I wore one
when I was training with Dave,

1911
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:11,930
Dave Burke and they're like oh where
you could rush card, you know, whatever.

1912
01:55:12,050 --> 01:55:14,840
But I was trying to narrow down kind
of the colors and stuff but they are

1913
01:55:14,841 --> 01:55:18,950
narrowed down and they shouldn't be
available within the next week and a half.

1914
01:55:18,980 --> 01:55:22,160
Where are those made?
Those are made all in America.

1915
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:27,080
All in America where he keyed rash guards.
Also, there's another kind of cool,

1916
01:55:27,081 --> 01:55:31,220
fun one, but I want to talk
about Dell until later. Also,

1917
01:55:32,270 --> 01:55:35,150
good way to support yourself.
Psychological warfare,

1918
01:55:35,180 --> 01:55:37,220
if you didn't know what that is,
it's an album with tracks,

1919
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:42,250
Jocko tracks and there are to aid you in
the event of you needing aid and you're

1920
01:55:43,711 --> 01:55:47,760
campaigning against weakness on your path,
on the path.

1921
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:53,100
Okay, so here's the thing about the
path. It's not always going to be easy.

1922
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:57,510
You know what I'm saying? I know what
you're saying. Yeah. Every day, man,

1923
01:55:57,660 --> 01:56:02,660
this is not a one day Gig.
This is in every day.

1924
01:56:04,150 --> 01:56:08,280
Every day is a Monday on the path.
Here's,

1925
01:56:08,430 --> 01:56:10,770
I will say this though. Okay, so, and you,

1926
01:56:10,771 --> 01:56:13,080
you read the letter for
the guy with drinking.

1927
01:56:13,081 --> 01:56:15,420
I guess I could relate to that deeply.

1928
01:56:15,480 --> 01:56:19,050
Deeply could relate to that and in a way,

1929
01:56:19,051 --> 01:56:20,460
and I don't want to go too deep into it,

1930
01:56:20,461 --> 01:56:25,461
but in a way that my situation was in a
way harder because the drinking wasn't

1931
01:56:26,971 --> 01:56:28,230
preventing me from working out.

1932
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:30,690
It wasn't preventing me from
doing like a lot of stuff.

1933
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:33,330
It was only preventing me from
doing like a handful of things,

1934
01:56:33,660 --> 01:56:36,450
but those things are really wanted to do,

1935
01:56:36,451 --> 01:56:38,760
but it was really preventing
me or it was put it this way,

1936
01:56:38,761 --> 01:56:42,690
it was making it super difficult and
then just the fact of like I'm drinking

1937
01:56:42,691 --> 01:56:46,470
every single day, you know kind of thing.
And the more you do, you know how you,

1938
01:56:46,471 --> 01:56:50,070
the more you get in the routine on
some with something, the harder,

1939
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:52,680
the harder it is to just straight a break.
That routine,

1940
01:56:52,830 --> 01:56:56,250
especially when it provides the payoff
is like drinking does chemically, I mean,

1941
01:56:56,310 --> 01:56:59,520
you know like when you drink it
like an instantaneous exactly right.

1942
01:56:59,521 --> 01:57:02,310
The longterm payoff,
no longterm negative,

1943
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:06,870
like not even proportionately
more beneficial to,

1944
01:57:06,980 --> 01:57:11,700
to to stop drinking. Like
you know when he said, wow,

1945
01:57:11,701 --> 01:57:15,930
this is how every day people
walk around feeling good. Really.

1946
01:57:16,290 --> 01:57:20,370
I felt that statement. Right. That's
so true. That's exactly what I thought.

1947
01:57:20,371 --> 01:57:23,610
I'm like Dang, no wonder. Tricky tricking
these feed Jocko doesn't drink. Right.

1948
01:57:23,611 --> 01:57:25,980
So no wonder Jack was doing
all this stuff and I could,

1949
01:57:26,130 --> 01:57:27,810
I could do all that stuff too.
That's how you feel.

1950
01:57:27,811 --> 01:57:30,930
I'm not saying I'm doing all this stuff.
Well, I'm just saying that's the feeling.

1951
01:57:30,970 --> 01:57:35,400
Psyche. I could dig it anyway.
Point is when you're on this path,

1952
01:57:35,401 --> 01:57:36,870
it's not always easy,

1953
01:57:38,670 --> 01:57:42,900
but psychological warfare is there to
get you through those difficult parts

1954
01:57:42,901 --> 01:57:47,400
parts that you admit or that
you can admit that you need.

1955
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:52,050
Maybe a little little push, a little
help, little spot, waking up early,

1956
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:56,940
procrastinating. That's a big one.
Skipping the workout, that kind of stuff.

1957
01:57:56,941 --> 01:57:58,160
Psychological warfare.
Okay,

1958
01:57:58,190 --> 01:58:00,920
so there's a track for every
little weakness he might encounter.

1959
01:58:01,370 --> 01:58:05,600
Skipping the Diet or, or, or slacking on
the Diet. That's a good one. Um, but yeah,

1960
01:58:05,630 --> 01:58:09,260
check that one out and uh, you know, see
what up. Good way to support yourself in.

1961
01:58:09,261 --> 01:58:14,030
You're on the path when you're on the
path and support the podcast as well.

1962
01:58:14,300 --> 01:58:16,460
Also,
you can get some Jocko white tea,

1963
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:21,530
which tastes like victory and
will make you feel really good.

1964
01:58:22,180 --> 01:58:26,270
You get that on Amazon. The books
way, the warrior kid number one,

1965
01:58:26,271 --> 01:58:31,190
which we just covered. Obviously it
is not just a book for kids. Yeah.

1966
01:58:31,550 --> 01:58:34,850
Uncle Jake has something to
teach. All of us, myself included,

1967
01:58:35,090 --> 01:58:40,090
it's for adults and teenagers and anyone
else that wants to have a better life.

1968
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:41,980
Can I add something about where the work?
Yeah.

1969
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:46,690
Which, and a I'm on a cycle. I
just read it over and over again.

1970
01:58:46,780 --> 01:58:49,390
Like as just like a routine to
your daughter. Daughter. Yeah.

1971
01:58:49,391 --> 01:58:52,880
She's four and a half so she
can't quite read yet. Um,

1972
01:58:53,260 --> 01:58:56,260
but there's little things
in there that it's like,

1973
01:58:56,680 --> 01:58:58,930
this is really good that
these kids are getting this,

1974
01:58:58,980 --> 01:59:01,870
this message because it's stuff
that as an adult you're like, Dang,

1975
01:59:01,871 --> 01:59:05,320
I never really, even though you know
it, like, okay, and this is what it is.

1976
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:06,490
When you're like,

1977
01:59:06,490 --> 01:59:08,980
how do you expect to be good at
something if you don't practice?

1978
01:59:10,280 --> 01:59:14,910
Like kids don't know that they
don't, they straight up don't. Yeah.

1979
01:59:15,070 --> 01:59:19,960
And guided practice, we kind of forget
that in a way. No, we absolutely do.

1980
01:59:20,290 --> 01:59:22,450
Yeah.
So yeah,

1981
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:27,070
it's for sure there's a lot in that book
and sometimes I read that book and I,

1982
01:59:27,071 --> 01:59:31,420
and, and there's even more in there than
I even recognized. You know what I mean?

1983
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:35,230
The lessons that are coming out
of my head, they're so important.

1984
01:59:35,231 --> 01:59:37,090
They're like beyond my own comprehension.

1985
01:59:37,570 --> 01:59:40,000
And I was just explaining the
book way of the Warrior Kid too,

1986
01:59:40,001 --> 01:59:43,490
which is going to come out. And I
was, I was just talking through a, uh,

1987
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:46,120
with a guy yesterday. Like
what, what it's about.

1988
01:59:46,930 --> 01:59:49,360
And as I'm explaining
everything that it's about,

1989
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:54,510
it's a lot of stuff and it's a lot
of really important lessons. Yes. Um,

1990
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:56,940
but yeah, it starts with the
way of the warrior kid. Uh,

1991
01:59:56,941 --> 02:00:00,490
the second warrior could
book will be out April 28th,

1992
02:00:00,490 --> 02:00:04,990
2018 actually speaking of books,
there is extreme ownership.

1993
02:00:05,170 --> 02:00:09,280
A new edition, a new edition is
out. It's not a totally new book.

1994
02:00:09,281 --> 02:00:12,340
It's a new addition of it.
It's going to be available November 21st.

1995
02:00:13,180 --> 02:00:17,220
You can get it for preorder right
now on Amazon if you want it. Um,

1996
02:00:17,320 --> 02:00:20,680
it's got a new forward in it. So,
so Leif and I wrote a new forward,

1997
02:00:21,670 --> 02:00:25,440
it has some color pictures
in it. Um, also the,

1998
02:00:25,441 --> 02:00:29,830
the new cover is black. We changed
the color from white to black. Why?

1999
02:00:30,940 --> 02:00:35,740
Because block dope. Yes, because
it looks cooler way cooler. Also,

2000
02:00:36,070 --> 02:00:36,791
and this is interesting,

2001
02:00:36,791 --> 02:00:41,770
there's a new Q and a section in the back
of the book that is actually from this

2002
02:00:41,771 --> 02:00:42,910
podcast.

2003
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:48,430
So I kind of rounded up the most
prominent leadership questions that, that,

2004
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:51,760
that we've answered on this podcast and
wrote them up and kind of Ed had it,

2005
02:00:51,761 --> 02:00:54,270
added him a little bit to make
sure that they made sense without,

2006
02:00:54,340 --> 02:00:59,320
without everything we've talked about
today without the tone and the pacing of

2007
02:00:59,321 --> 02:01:02,410
what's being said. Excited,
edit them a little bit,

2008
02:01:02,411 --> 02:01:04,870
but they're there what they're,

2009
02:01:04,871 --> 02:01:08,170
what the answers were given on this
podcast and they're all from everyone's

2010
02:01:08,171 --> 02:01:12,820
questions. So everyone, uh,
appreciate the questions.

2011
02:01:12,850 --> 02:01:14,110
Everyone that listens to the podcast,

2012
02:01:14,111 --> 02:01:16,570
you helped us write this
next section of this book.

2013
02:01:16,571 --> 02:01:19,720
Echo Charles is in it
as the question asker.

2014
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:24,940
So Echo Charles is in the book and
I'll hold it up if you're on youtube,

2015
02:01:24,941 --> 02:01:29,230
there's the new book right
there. Boom, discipline or sorry,

2016
02:01:29,350 --> 02:01:34,350
extreme ownership available November
21st also you can get the book discipline

2017
02:01:36,881 --> 02:01:40,880
equals freedom field manual.
It's a manual for getting after it.

2018
02:01:41,270 --> 02:01:44,330
So if you want to get after
it, get, get the field manual.

2019
02:01:45,170 --> 02:01:49,190
Discipline equals freedom, faults
and actions. They're both in there.

2020
02:01:49,670 --> 02:01:53,450
It's been great. Again, getting great
feedback. Appreciate everyone's feedback.

2021
02:01:54,710 --> 02:01:58,670
It's pretty straightforward book.
No fluff involved,

2022
02:01:59,570 --> 02:02:02,270
not,
not making you read a bunch of

2023
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:09,170
words to get to my point.
Here's my point. Boom.

2024
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:11,780
You can get it anywhere that they,

2025
02:02:11,930 --> 02:02:16,850
that they sell books
including obviously Amazon,

2026
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:21,230
Barnes and noble. You can get it at
Walmart by the way. Target the publisher,

2027
02:02:21,231 --> 02:02:23,750
ship that out to everywhere
so you can pick it up.

2028
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:28,580
It's a good book to give to people.
In my opinion.

2029
02:02:28,940 --> 02:02:31,670
It's, it's, it's not just
like giving someone a book,

2030
02:02:31,790 --> 02:02:33,890
you're giving them something
a little bit more than a book.

2031
02:02:35,830 --> 02:02:38,600
It's like something a little bit more
than a book. It's, I dunno if I can't,

2032
02:02:38,660 --> 02:02:42,550
I can't explain it too well
right now. Look at it. Yeah.
Yeah. You can look at it.

2033
02:02:42,690 --> 02:02:47,570
It's, it's not normal. I
would say it's not normal. Um,

2034
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:50,090
if you want the audio
version of that book,

2035
02:02:50,091 --> 02:02:54,830
which a lot of people have been asking
about, the audio version is available.

2036
02:02:54,831 --> 02:02:57,920
It is not on audible and it
is not going to be on audible.

2037
02:02:58,430 --> 02:03:01,310
It is made and we put it together,

2038
02:03:01,700 --> 02:03:06,700
echo directed and produced the album that
also has tracks so it's an album with

2039
02:03:07,971 --> 02:03:12,971
tracks and it's available as MP3 anywhere
that you can get MP3 tracks for sale,

2040
02:03:16,640 --> 02:03:20,090
iTunes, Amazon, music,
music, Google play, wherever.

2041
02:03:20,180 --> 02:03:22,370
Whenever MP3 platform you utilize,

2042
02:03:22,371 --> 02:03:25,520
you can find it there and if you like
the leadership principles that we talk

2043
02:03:25,521 --> 02:03:29,120
about on this podcast and you want to
get them for your team or your business.

2044
02:03:29,660 --> 02:03:31,880
We have a leadership and
management consulting company.

2045
02:03:31,881 --> 02:03:36,230
It's called echelon front.
It's me. It's Lafe Babin.

2046
02:03:36,260 --> 02:03:39,680
It's JP Denelle. It's

and
if you

2048
02:03:46,101 --> 02:03:51,101
have more questions or you have answers
to the questions that we covered that

2049
02:03:52,701 --> 02:03:55,190
are better than the answers that we gave
today and you want to share them with

2050
02:03:55,191 --> 02:03:58,370
us, that'd be cool. I want
to learn, you can find us.

2051
02:03:58,640 --> 02:04:02,780
We're actually on the interwebs,
on Twitter,

2052
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:07,730
on Instagram, on Dash facey bowl. Aha.

2053
02:04:08,990 --> 02:04:09,890
Echo is an echo.

2054
02:04:09,891 --> 02:04:14,891
Charles and I am at Jocko
Willink and to close out,

2055
02:04:15,771 --> 02:04:18,890
I want to say thanks to our military
that's out there on the front lines.

2056
02:04:18,891 --> 02:04:23,891
I recently got reports of
Isis in Iraq sending kids to,

2057
02:04:25,910 --> 02:04:28,040
to surrender to coalition forces,

2058
02:04:28,041 --> 02:04:33,041
but they'd been laden with suicide bombs
and rigged to blow up and as these kids

2059
02:04:34,521 --> 02:04:39,521
would approach the areas set aside
for surrender to American forces,

2060
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:41,130
they would,

2061
02:04:41,130 --> 02:04:44,670
the Americans would see the terror in
their eyes and realize that there was

2062
02:04:44,671 --> 02:04:48,300
something wrong.
And American military men,

2063
02:04:49,170 --> 02:04:54,170
especially explosive ordinance disposal
technicians would risk their lives time

2064
02:04:55,201 --> 02:04:58,170
and time again to go disarm these bombs,

2065
02:04:59,070 --> 02:05:03,330
risking their lives so that
these young children can live.

2066
02:05:06,460 --> 02:05:07,780
Who?
Who even does that?

2067
02:05:09,070 --> 02:05:09,880
Yeah.

2068
02:05:09,880 --> 02:05:13,420
I'll tell you who America's
servicemen and women.

2069
02:05:14,410 --> 02:05:14,860
Yeah,

2070
02:05:14,860 --> 02:05:19,860
they are the finest and we thank them
for their service and sacrifice and to

2071
02:05:21,521 --> 02:05:24,880
police and law enforcement,
firefighters or paramedics,

2072
02:05:25,330 --> 02:05:26,710
other first responders.

2073
02:05:28,230 --> 02:05:32,460
Thank you for doing your job.
Extremely difficult,

2074
02:05:33,810 --> 02:05:35,070
often thankless,

2075
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:41,000
keeping us safe here on the home front
and to everyone else that is listening.

2076
02:05:43,830 --> 02:05:48,300
Remember this, if there's something
in your life that you want to change,

2077
02:05:48,630 --> 02:05:52,260
then change it.
You have control.

2078
02:05:52,650 --> 02:05:56,940
And if you don't think you have control,
then take control.

2079
02:05:58,620 --> 02:06:01,080
Get a grip on your life

2080
02:06:03,020 --> 02:06:05,240
and start getting after it.

2081
02:06:07,230 --> 02:06:08,880
So until next time,

2082
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:12,330
this is echo and Jocko out.
