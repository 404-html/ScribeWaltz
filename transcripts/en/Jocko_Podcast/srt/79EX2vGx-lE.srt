1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,960
This is Jocko podcast number
one 21 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,910
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,033
Okay,

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,530
I'm going to tell you a story

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,930
and this is a story of war
and pain and love and death.

6
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,610
Okay.

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,280
And this story.

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:36,970
Okay.

9
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,920
This is a heroic story,

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,700
quite possibly one of the most heroic
stories and at the same time this story is

11
00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:50,570
also a tragedy

12
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:56,210
and it is quite possibly one of the most

13
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,970
tragic stories.

14
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:01,550
Yeah.

15
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,790
This is a story of a father and a son.

16
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:09,791
This is a story that spans six wars
each one more difficult than the next.

17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,450
This is
a story of life.

18
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,990
We had like all stories of life.

19
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:29,380
This story ends the way that
all lives and this story

20
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,430
ends in death.

21
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,673
Yeah.

22
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,230
There is no story book ending.
There is no walking off into the sunset.

23
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:44,520
There is no mercy and no quarter
and no remorse from death.

24
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,333
Okay,

25
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,820
good. As I prepared

26
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,950
to tell this story,
there were times

27
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,080
when I started to decide against it.

28
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,590
Okay.

29
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,850
Where I began to think it would be
too much.

30
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,380
There was another part of me

31
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,230
that spoke louder and spoke stronger
and that other part of me that knows

32
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:25,710
that to hide from the darkness is only
to allow darkness to grow and I will not

33
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:27,064
do that.

34
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,980
I will tell this story and this story
that I am going to tell is not just a

35
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:37,630
story.
It is not made up.

36
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,970
The story is the real story
of the real lives of two men,

37
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,910
two marines,
a father and a son

38
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,970
who fought many battles

39
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,790
both literally hand metaphorically and
who did their best to fight and win

40
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:13,690
and who we can both learn a lot from,

41
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,990
but we can only learn if we listen.

42
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,190
We can only learn if we study and
we can only learn if we remember

43
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,510
what these men went through,

44
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,190
what they did,
how they lived

45
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,600
and how they died.

46
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,130
I will begin the story with the father.

47
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,770
He is the most famous marine in
the history of the Marine Corps.

48
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,320
He is one of the most highly decorated
men in American military history.

49
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:05,490
He's the only man ever
awarded five Navy crosses.

50
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,810
His name is Louis Polar,

51
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,540
better known as chesty puller

52
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,400
and he is to most marines
the ultimate marine,

53
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,270
the godfather of the Marine Corps.
To this day,

54
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,560
the mascot of the Marine Corps,
which is a bulldog,

55
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,740
that bulldog is named
chesty after chesty puller.

56
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:40,770
They're currently on bulldog number 15

57
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:47,410
named chesty the 15th in bootcamp in
Marine Corps boot camp recruits sing good

58
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:50,150
night chesty at the end of a long day

59
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,440
he is embedded in the
fiber of the Marine Corps.

60
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:04,970
Then you might wonder who was this
man and how did he become an icon

61
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,550
to a group that is one of the most
elite fighting forces in the history of

62
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:14,980
mankind,
the United States Marine Corps.

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,890
In order to find out who this man is,

64
00:05:18,891 --> 00:05:22,070
we are going to explore
a book called Marine,

65
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:29,230
the life of chesty puller
written by Burke Davis

66
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,760
and I will go
to the book.

67
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,770
Louis Burwell Puller was born June 26
to 1898 into a small boys paradise,

68
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,400
the village of West Point Virginia.

69
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:54,950
We're the [inaudible] monkey and
patrimony rivers form the Broad York.

70
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,680
The waters were full of fish,
crab and oysters,

71
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,350
and the woodlands teamed with game.

72
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,800
Sounds like a good place to grow up.

73
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,350
He often talked to his dream of going
to the Virginia Military Institute and

74
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:16,880
becoming a soldier from his
reading, his family traditions,

75
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:19,280
his love of hunting,
fishing and horseback riding.

76
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,090
He was drawn to military life and Vmi.

77
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,120
50 years later at the
end of a fighting career,

78
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,220
he would look back to those days and say,

79
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:34,221
I learned more in the woods hunting and
stalking about the actual art of war

80
00:06:34,231 --> 00:06:36,300
than I ever learned
any school of any kind.

81
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:37,630
Yeah.

82
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,630
Those days in the woods as a kid
saved my life many a time in combat.

83
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,440
Okay,

84
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,680
so he wanted to go in the
military from a very young age,

85
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,980
and of course I always have to mention
that I'm going to go very rapidly through

86
00:06:53,051 --> 00:06:55,210
this book.
It may take a while,

87
00:06:55,211 --> 00:06:59,530
but I'm skipping huge parts and
trying to hit the highlights,

88
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,960
but to get the full information,

89
00:07:01,961 --> 00:07:06,010
obviously you need to get the book and
read it yourself. It's a fantastic book.

90
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:13,480
Back to the book, his effort, his
efforts at translating Caesar.

91
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:15,500
Okay.

92
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,790
Made him inpatient.

93
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:17,890
Okay.

94
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,620
For the true message
of the soldier author.

95
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:25,030
He was so fascinated by the narrative
of war that he devoured it in one night.

96
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,710
It opened a world,

97
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:32,440
a new world for him and began a lifelong
career of serious military reading.

98
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,990
It's a common theme we see
with great military leaders.

99
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,290
They read all the time and it started
for him at a young age when he was

100
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,820
translating Caesar.

101
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,290
Okay.

102
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,910
He was captain of the track team.

103
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,900
It's champion Hi Trumper and ran well
in the 100 to 20 and 440 yard dashes.

104
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:55,610
So he was fairly athletic.
Calvo he's not a big guy.

105
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,370
He was not a big guy when you see
pictures up and he was pretty,

106
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:02,750
he was relatively small in stature
and he was also relatively, you know,

107
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:04,610
he wasn't like a bulked up guy.

108
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,850
They and their stories on
why they called him chesty.

109
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,520
The predominant story is, even though he
was small, when he would march in, uh,

110
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,980
on the parade ground,
he would stick his chest out.

111
00:08:15,981 --> 00:08:17,330
So they called them chesty puller

112
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,240
back to the book in the last week of high
school in 1917 the senior class played

113
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:24,560
hooky one day on the theory,

114
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:28,220
which proved to be correct that the
principal would not dare expel them all.

115
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:33,590
Louis was the leader of this prank and
when they returned from a swim and a six

116
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:34,940
mile hike to the river,

117
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,900
he helped to bring back a dozen
or more bull frogs and paperbacks.

118
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:44,540
Lewis and Dave field toss the frogs into
a school room window and we're rewarded

119
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,510
by screams and other
sounds of pandemonium.

120
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,630
So He's,
you know,

121
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,230
I had to tell at least one of those
stories that he was a mischievous kid.

122
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,750
You know, a little bit of a rebel.
He enrolled, he did graduate,

123
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,700
enrolled in the military at it Virginia
Military Institute. And back to the book,

124
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:07,950
Lewis was promoted to Cadet
Corp at the end of the year.

125
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,780
Academically he stood
177 out of 233 cadets.

126
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,410
So, well, not like the
front runner in the class.

127
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,510
His subject standings in his class,
mathematics 200th English 149th German,

128
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:26,511
130 eighth history a hundred and second
and most significantly military science

129
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:32,750
89th he had no demerits for the
year and almost unheard of records,

130
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,730
so academically not exactly crushing it,

131
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:41,430
but military bearing and whatnot.
No demerits. He was doing well.

132
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,490
Now this is where things start
to get a little bit interesting.

133
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,490
Obviously is 1917 so we've got world
war one is going on and here we go.

134
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:50,011
Back to book.

135
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:54,960
His chief disappointment was that they
were soldiers without arms for the rifles

136
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,870
were taken by the army
as the war in Europe,

137
00:09:57,871 --> 00:10:01,530
a war on and ammunition had been
too scarce for target practice.

138
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,720
With that,
he said,

139
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,650
I'm going to enlist in the marines.
He said,

140
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,660
I don't want the war to end without me.

141
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:17,070
I'm going with the rifles if
they need them, they need me to.

142
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,760
On June 27th the day
after his 20th birthday,

143
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,670
Louis took the train to
Richmond and enlisted in the
Marine Corps bound for boot

144
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:27,390
camp at Paris island,
South Carolina.

145
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,830
So wasn't going to sit around and
let that water run out on him.

146
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,640
Shows up for his a bootcamp.

147
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,780
There's a drill instructor.
Uh,

148
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,580
one of the great things about this book
is the guy that wrote the book of Burke

149
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:44,940
Davis.

150
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,770
He not only sat down and interviewed
chesty puller for hundreds of hours,

151
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:54,750
he also went and interviewed all kinds
of people that interacted with Chester

152
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,190
chesty poler during his career,

153
00:10:56,191 --> 00:10:58,830
which he interacted with a lot of people
cause he was in the Marine Corps for a

154
00:10:58,831 --> 00:11:00,540
really long time,
for decades.

155
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,200
And so the book has all kinds of
research and all kinds of interviews.

156
00:11:06,661 --> 00:11:10,050
And one of the people that got
interviewed was the drill instructor,

157
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:15,051
one of the drill instructors that put
chesty puller through bootcamp drill

158
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:20,070
instructor. Uh, I think it was
a gunnery Sergeant Desk Bari.

159
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,680
And he said, by God, he's a marine.

160
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:27,420
He looks as if as if he must sleep
at attention. You always know,

161
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,670
I have to tell him to look mean
and nasty out there marching.

162
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,190
But I never had to tell him.
He's a natural,

163
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,470
he never makes the same mistake twice.

164
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,650
And he talked about, he
talked about polars military
history knowledge. He said,

165
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,400
hell, he gives me an inferiority
complex. I've read some,

166
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:47,680
but that kid knows von
Clausewitz backwards and guys,

167
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,420
guys I never heard of by the dozen.
He's some kid.

168
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,590
This stuff is like a religion with him.

169
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,090
Okay,

170
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,910
so that's,
that's real stuff right there.

171
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,350
You know we hear General
Maddis talk about that too.

172
00:12:00,351 --> 00:12:03,370
I had general Madison never gets
surprised because he's read it before.

173
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,590
Not going to surprise me
because I already know,

174
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,900
I already seen this situation before.
Maybe not exact,

175
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:09,220
but I at least have an idea of it.

176
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,900
The non coms admired polars work on
the bayonet field where big signs raid

177
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,660
advanced to kill.

178
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:21,880
Yeah.

179
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,750
For two months the class went through
intensive drills in the bay bayonet,

180
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,360
that rifle boxing,
judo and infantry drill.

181
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,250
So back in the day, they're still getting
after and a boxing and judo by the way,

182
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,950
is a good combination, very good
combination. You get your take downs,

183
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,610
you get your grappling
and you get some striking.

184
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,540
One day the men were told that their
orders had come and they were packed to

185
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:47,050
leave for Hoboken New Jersey
to ship out for France.

186
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,340
Okay.

187
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,840
Being meaning they were going to war.

188
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:56,070
The move was postponed for several days
until armistice day canceled the orders.

189
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,210
So the end of the war came.

190
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,920
He was detached and sent to the
third officer's training school,

191
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,500
so they took him and said, you know
what, you did so good in bootcamp.

192
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,500
The war's over, we don't have orders.
We're going to send you to be an officer.

193
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,271
Back to the book,

194
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:16,690
He became a second lieutenant on June
4th two weeks later when he had finished

195
00:13:16,691 --> 00:13:17,680
machine gun school,

196
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:22,770
the end of the war brought a huge cut in
the marine corps on June 16th polar was

197
00:13:22,841 --> 00:13:27,100
discharged with hundreds of others
of his rank and he was at loose ends.

198
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,650
He'd been a marine officer for two weeks.

199
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,090
Okay.

200
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,100
Now as he's kind of processing out,

201
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,640
he met a guy named Captain Route Curtis
at the Marine Corps headquarters and

202
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,930
this is what the advice he gave him.
You know,

203
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:44,230
he sees this young hard charger and says,
if I were you, I'd go down to Haiti.

204
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,710
You'll get commissions in the,

205
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:50,110
in the constabulary down there and they
need good men and there's plenty of

206
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:52,930
fighting.
You'd see action and have some fun.

207
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,660
So at this point in Haiti,

208
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:00,670
they had basically built this, uh, this,

209
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:05,230
it's,
it should,

210
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:07,810
John Dahl has,
where's gendarmerie is what they call it,

211
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,910
but it's a military force.

212
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:11,460
Yeah.

213
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,720
That also does police work kind of.
So,

214
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,260
and there was a, there was a revolution
in Haiti. There were issues in Haiti.

215
00:14:19,261 --> 00:14:23,790
And so America actually invaded Haiti in
1915 and now they had established this

216
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:26,430
forced to keep things under control.

217
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:31,130
And the way they did it,
it was run, they took the,

218
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,700
the locals and they put,

219
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:38,100
basically hired former marines
to be in charge of them.

220
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,290
And then the goal was as the locals,
the,

221
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,890
the native Haitians w started
to understand military
operations and they would

222
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:51,170
get promoted and the American
marines and soldiers could go home.

223
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:55,800
That was the plan. So let's see. Um,

224
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,920
kind of just covered this,
but Haiti was strife,

225
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,680
was the strife of war torn
western tip of the island,

226
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:02,090
shared with Dominican Republic.

227
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:05,990
Revolutions had been shaking
the government since 1914
after almost a century of

228
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:09,410
freedom from France since 1916 at the
request of the Haitian government,

229
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:12,110
marines had police the
country I made violence,

230
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,300
which had taken nearly 2000 lives,
almost all Haitian General Smedley,

231
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,360
Smedley Butler who will get to sometime
on this podcast had created the John

232
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:28,670
Dahl, Marie the Haiti with a straw
with a shrewd disregard for precedent.

233
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:33,380
The senior officers where US Marine
officers whose brief tours of two years

234
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:36,140
created a supply of
field trained commanders.

235
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:42,050
But he chose the marine enlisted men to
act as junior officers and allowed them

236
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:46,130
to stay as long as they wish on the
theory that they became more valuable as

237
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:49,490
they learned the language and
customs of the people in practice.

238
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:53,240
It was these marines, these marines
enlisted men who operated the force

239
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,630
under them were many native soldiers,

240
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,050
most of them veterans of the old
Haitian army. And from this pool,

241
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:02,150
they were drawn second lieutenants
and sergeants and corporals.

242
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:04,730
So that's what you have. That's the
situation. So he deploys down there,

243
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,880
he's not really in the Marine
Corps is a hired hand basically.

244
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,580
Um,
so now he's there,

245
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,260
not for very long and back to the
book about 4:00 PM without warning.

246
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,510
Louis stumbled into the
first fight of his career,

247
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,380
improved his instinct for combat,
the pack train, this is a group,

248
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:27,720
he was moving the,
a group of people through the woods.

249
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:31,340
The packed train was ambling around
a wooded bet bend between hills,

250
00:16:31,341 --> 00:16:35,480
which were littered with stones and
cactus when in met an oncoming Keiko band.

251
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,070
This is the,
the revolutionaries,

252
00:16:37,071 --> 00:16:41,030
I guess you call them the [inaudible]
band of about a hundred equally surprised.

253
00:16:41,031 --> 00:16:42,770
And at the end in the same formation,

254
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,100
polar sport has spurred his
horse and yelled charge,

255
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,270
attack the column,
charged horses,

256
00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:52,640
pack meals and all.
And in the funder and dust,

257
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,750
fierce gels of the cake goes broke for
the hills firing a few stray rounds.

258
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,590
So that was kind of his first combat
experience. You got to bring that up.

259
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,630
Uh,
but

260
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:09,290
he was default aggressive
even in an logistics movement.

261
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,780
You know, they've got a bunch of
pack horses and he's like, oh charge.

262
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:14,943
And it worked

263
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:21,470
back to the book. Another situation that
he gets into from the opposite shore,

264
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,650
a native and Dominican dress
rode out on a magnificent horse,

265
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:29,840
a big buck skin with white mane and tail
who splashed through the shallows under

266
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:34,190
perfect control though, without a
bridle or saddle, a wonderful horse.

267
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:38,590
Polar said, I'd surely
like to have him. Bruno,

268
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,670
who's one of the guys,

269
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,720
one of the natives that that was working
under him moderate and creole and a

270
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:48,721
rifle cracked polar saw one of his men
pull his rifle bolt back and reject a

271
00:17:50,011 --> 00:17:50,760
cartridge.

272
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,260
The beautiful horse stood in the river
looking nervous about his rider floated

273
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:57,390
down the stream in a stain of blood.

274
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,570
The stunned polar turned to Bruno.
Did you order that man shot?

275
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:09,720
Hell Sir. You said you wanted the horse.
Anything the captain says is our command.

276
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,250
We have discipline here sir.

277
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,860
The man seemed unmoved by the cold
blooded killing my God. Catch the horse,

278
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,770
get the men over the river. And see if
you can find that man's family. And this,

279
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,960
the reason I pulled this
out is this line right here,

280
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:30,090
Lewis never again expressed himself. I'd
lead before these soldiers. So that's,

281
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:32,610
that's a crazy story, right? He
says all that's a beautiful horse.

282
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,240
I'd love to have that horse. And they
kill the horse riders. Just a civilian.

283
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:40,170
But he realized the power
that you have in command.

284
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,910
And there's sometimes when people don't
realize that people don't realize how I

285
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,290
run into that with business leaders.
They'll walk around,

286
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:51,300
all this is this is crap and everyone
thinks it's crap then or you know,

287
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:54,480
do you got to realize that
your words have meaning.

288
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,240
And when you're in a senior position,
your words have power.

289
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,840
And so that was how he learned that
listen to in a very horrible way,

290
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,030
back to the book company aid weighted
the Stream without opposition.

291
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,720
But as they mounted the rich beyond a
rifle fired and there was a terrifying

292
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,780
shriek of a boat overhead.
Polar duct.

293
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,700
Lieutenant Lee was at his side and said,

294
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,050
Captain Polar Officers do not
flinch under fire. They stand,

295
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,310
the men take note of this thing.
It is of first importance.

296
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:31,890
So he's going to get plenty of exercise
in that and you'll see he becomes well

297
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:34,500
known for never flinching
again under fire.

298
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,090
Here's something about the people they
were fighting these Keiko bandits.

299
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:44,091
They carry off everybody and every wounded
man and when they catch our wounded,

300
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,350
well captain,
if you see one,

301
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,890
you'll never forget the Kaikos believe
every man who dies must go before the

302
00:19:49,891 --> 00:19:53,460
gods and they use their knives
to see that when our men go,

303
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,050
they are beyond recognition.

304
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,410
They slashed the face to ribbons
and tear of the body apart.

305
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,050
You will see captain,

306
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:04,590
it's a matter of life or death for the
officers and noncommissioned officers

307
00:20:04,591 --> 00:20:05,490
here to respect,

308
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,520
to have respect from the men
and something more adulation.

309
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:15,810
They must obey orders to the letter.
Without question though, they die for it.

310
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,640
It was the only way to handle
men in combat. If you lose
control, you lose lives.

311
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,350
It is as simple as that.

312
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,710
So there you see the super strict
discipline that they're into.

313
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,010
And this is something that you're going
to see this theme throughout the book

314
00:20:29,011 --> 00:20:31,680
that chesty has this,

315
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,860
this reputation which is earned
of being super hard core.

316
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,370
But also in the book you're gonna see
over and over again that there's a huge

317
00:20:41,371 --> 00:20:43,230
dichotomy that he's super hardcore,

318
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:46,770
but at the same time he knows when
he needs to give people slack.

319
00:20:46,771 --> 00:20:50,350
He knows when he needs to be a positive
reinforcement instead of a negative one.

320
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:55,150
And his rep is reputation, doesn't have
that. But that line right there like,

321
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,560
hey, they just need to do
whatever you say. He doesn't
even believe that, but it's,

322
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,490
it's pointed out.

323
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,820
And so I brought it up because
the contradiction becomes
pretty clear or not the

324
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:06,670
contradiction, but the dichotomy
is very clear throughout this book.

325
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,420
So back to the book General John,

326
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:18,160
a lagoon commandant of the corps had
come to Haiti on inspection and Louis was

327
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:20,500
anxious to see the hero
of the fighting in France.

328
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:23,680
And Camp Lejune isn't called
Camp Lajune for nothing.

329
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:29,140
And at this point a marine patrol
filed pass. And this is a good another,

330
00:21:29,141 --> 00:21:30,160
another good lesson.

331
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,780
They were unshaven and
ill kempt I'm afraid to,

332
00:21:34,781 --> 00:21:37,900
men are a little ragged
and out of uniform sir.

333
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:41,710
And the company commander Clinton said,
I'm trying to improve them.

334
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:46,600
Colonel, I'm a field soldier. Lazoon said,

335
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:49,240
I don't give a damn what
men look like in the field.

336
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,110
The only one thing interests
me and that's ending this war.

337
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,050
Don't waste your time shining
them up for jungle work.

338
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,830
Our only objective is
success and I demand that.

339
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,590
So there's a contradiction right there.
Like we'll not a contradiction,

340
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:04,880
but there's the dichotomy and
he's hearing it from now on.

341
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,950
The other side is here in this room from
a general the June who's saying, look,

342
00:22:08,951 --> 00:22:10,300
I don't care what these
guys look like in the field.

343
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,450
You don't need to polish them up. They
need to when they need to be fighting.

344
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,130
And chesty puller becomes very famous
for the way he appears sometimes in the

345
00:22:18,131 --> 00:22:22,810
field. Meaning he's not exactly
spit and Polish out there.

346
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,800
He was awarded the medal military
air of the Republic of Haiti and

347
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,110
he did not go unnoticed by his superiors.

348
00:22:38,111 --> 00:22:43,000
And early in 1921 he was a recommended
for a permanent commission in the Marine

349
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,280
Corps,
whereas rank was now that have sergeant,

350
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:50,710
he served as a judge adjutant
to Colonel Vandergriff.

351
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:51,970
This is another famous marine.

352
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,380
He again became a second lieutenant US
Marine Corps, but this time as irregular,

353
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,720
I may not have much else to go on. He told
a friend, but I have some perseverance.

354
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:07,210
He had fought in 40 actions in Haiti.
He developed his instinct.

355
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:12,010
He developed his instinct of talent for
using terrain and battle and learn the

356
00:23:12,011 --> 00:23:13,240
lessons of jungle fighting.

357
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:18,010
He becomes strongly prejudiced against
barracks and headquarters soldiers.

358
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,110
Despite his youth.

359
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,930
He was one of the most combat
seasoned combat officers into core.

360
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,800
So he got noticed because
he did well in combat.

361
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,310
He eventually gets,
gets up,

362
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,660
hired on into the Marine Corps as a
sergeant and then very quickly thereafter

363
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:38,320
goes back to the officer ranks after
he's working for our colonel Vandergriff.

364
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,180
So there you go.

365
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,630
And you can see he develops this prejudice
against barracks and headquarters

366
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,100
soldiers.
Rear Echelon is what we call them

367
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,660
now.
After he came back to the states,

368
00:23:52,661 --> 00:23:57,661
he gets chosen to run the the Marine
Corps drill team who has apparently

369
00:24:00,611 --> 00:24:04,300
competing and they hadn't been winning
against the navy and the army and the

370
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:08,050
coast guard teams. They've, they've
been beating them and so he takes over.

371
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,160
So here we go. Private Bob Nourish a
company clerk drafted for the detachment,

372
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:13,780
shared the astonishment of his mates.

373
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,440
The lieutenant told us the first day
that we would bring home the cop or die

374
00:24:17,441 --> 00:24:21,790
trying and from the cold I, he gave
us, we believed it. We found out.

375
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,160
We found we weren't mistaken.
He took,

376
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,040
he took out the silent drill manual
and started this from scratch.

377
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,210
He drove us day after day until we figured
we'd never lived to see Boston when

378
00:24:31,211 --> 00:24:31,961
he was through with us.

379
00:24:31,961 --> 00:24:36,961
We literally thought as if we had one
head instead of 80 yet somehow though he

380
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,480
was hard as nails,
he could be as friendly.

381
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:44,020
You can be friendly with us like
no other officer we'd ever seen.

382
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,800
We gave them all we had. So there
you go. Driving people hard,

383
00:24:47,801 --> 00:24:50,320
but they love him and they
love him because he treats
them with respect and he's

384
00:24:50,321 --> 00:24:50,771
nice to him.

385
00:24:50,771 --> 00:24:55,771
And that's the dichotomy and he f he
knows instinctively how to walk that line

386
00:24:56,441 --> 00:25:00,490
and that dichotomy. Leadership back
to the book a few weeks afterwards,

387
00:25:00,491 --> 00:25:05,020
polar was whisked off to his next duty
station assigned as a flying cadet in

388
00:25:05,021 --> 00:25:06,070
Pensacola,
Florida,

389
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:09,880
a chance which he had been pleading
since its first flights and he improvised

390
00:25:09,881 --> 00:25:12,040
Jenny bomber hatery.
So I didn't cover this part in the book,

391
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:17,041
but when he was in Haiti he did like
flights and dropped grenades on enemy

392
00:25:18,191 --> 00:25:23,191
locations and he was into it and he
gets down to Pensacola and fails his two

393
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:30,300
solo tests and he left Pensacola
disappointed and interestingly three years

394
00:25:31,871 --> 00:25:34,660
after he,
after this happened,

395
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,320
he tried to reapply.

396
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,840
And this is an interesting comment,

397
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:44,050
the medical board in Washington in
answer to his plea for one more chance,

398
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:49,170
found him physically fit to fly but not
temperamentally adapted for aviation

399
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,210
training.
So That's interesting.

400
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,120
You know that this guy who's
obviously a great combat leaders,

401
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:59,380
didn't have whatever the whatever
they were looking for for flying.

402
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,590
He didn't have it and he
made multiple attempts.

403
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,973
MMM.

404
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,790
When he went back home for a little while,

405
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
he went to a dance and there's some sort
of interesting fact that that's the way

406
00:26:16,591 --> 00:26:19,320
they did it. Back in the day, you know,
hey, we're going to go to a dance,

407
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:23,160
and he met a woman named Virginia Evans.

408
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:28,200
He dance with her three
times with fumbling attempts
at conversation during the

409
00:26:28,201 --> 00:26:32,700
next dance. He made up his mind. His
manner became assured, will you marry me?

410
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,310
She laughed.
Heavens no.

411
00:26:35,311 --> 00:26:38,700
How can I do that when I haven't
even finished the school? You will.

412
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,650
He spent the night in the stag
line watching and dancing her.

413
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,980
She noticed that he danced with
no other girl after that meeting.

414
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:49,470
He did not see her again
for almost 11 years,

415
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,280
but he never lifted the long range seat,

416
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,970
gets his mind committed
to something in Virginia.

417
00:26:57,971 --> 00:26:59,560
Evans was what he was committed to.

418
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:04,890
He gets shipped off to Hawaii in
July of 1926 when he shows up there.

419
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,770
Another interesting story,

420
00:27:08,771 --> 00:27:13,330
Louis held firm discipline and its company
and some men were probably resentful

421
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:16,960
until they learned that he spared
himself less than he did others.

422
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:20,800
He was ruthless with violators of
safety precautions where firearms were

423
00:27:20,801 --> 00:27:24,460
involved and every time a man shot a
weapon on the base without good reason,

424
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:28,240
the fine was automatically
$20 one day on inspection,

425
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,910
polar saw a 45 in the guard house,
picked it up,

426
00:27:30,911 --> 00:27:34,060
release the clip and pulled
the slide and the trigger.

427
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,320
The gun fired unexpectedly in a bullet,
furrowed into the ceiling.

428
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,710
Chesty Puller had an AED,
an accidental discharge.

429
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,440
Though he had taken all the precautions
except to look in the firing chamber,

430
00:27:46,441 --> 00:27:51,441
polar find himself $100 which he gave
to the guards to buy beer for liberty

431
00:27:52,441 --> 00:27:53,274
party.

432
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,590
He bombarded headquarters with pleased
to send them to Nicaragua where war had

433
00:27:58,591 --> 00:28:03,570
broken out and marines. We're trying
to put down a native bandit uprising,

434
00:28:03,571 --> 00:28:07,500
so wars going on in Nicaragua and
he says, Hey, send me down there.

435
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,340
Back to the book. Nicaragua adds even
more rugged than hated than Haiti.

436
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:15,480
The Green Rolling Country of jungle and
planes dominated by towering highlands

437
00:28:15,481 --> 00:28:19,380
upon which we're tumbled.
Mountain masses. For many years,

438
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:22,650
revolutions had torn the land
despite the presence of US Marines.

439
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:25,610
And now a bitter new war had
called them back after a year.

440
00:28:25,611 --> 00:28:30,611
His absence in the north
lay at unconquered Indian
empire whose people did not

441
00:28:31,081 --> 00:28:35,880
recognize the central government and
there where he moved back and forth across

442
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,370
the border of Honduras
was the rebel chief.

443
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,940
Augustus Augusto Caesar Sandino.

444
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,050
Yeah.

445
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,900
So that's what's going on in Nicaragua.

446
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:48,880
Okay.

447
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,170
Chesty poler shows up, reported to
general e are beetle, and he says,

448
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,950
I'll give you a company up
in the Sago vs in the north.

449
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,870
I understand you like to mix it up.

450
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,070
Big Mix up, big, mix it up.

451
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,140
So this is, again, you know this,

452
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:12,620
there's so many things that he does that
just build this incredible reputation

453
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,870
that he ends up with.
And here's one of them.

454
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:21,020
The native Voss with a f was a fire eating
brigand who had been appointed as the

455
00:29:21,571 --> 00:29:24,210
local HEFY.
Half a politico

456
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,760
holler invaded his office,

457
00:29:26,761 --> 00:29:30,390
accompanied by a sergeant and in brief
words told the terrorists that he would,

458
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:34,140
that he had come to restore order and
that trouble trouble makers would be,

459
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:37,110
would fare badly.
He ended quietly.

460
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,980
You will be held responsible for
any further disorder with your life.

461
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:43,900
As he talked,

462
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,710
he saw partially open drawer in the
desk before the chief and the bow of a

463
00:29:47,711 --> 00:29:52,600
revolver. The boss looked as if he
wanted to snatch the pistol. Go ahead.

464
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:56,200
Polar said, use it if you can.
We'll settle this once and for all.

465
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,820
You'd better be fast.

466
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,073
Like

467
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:05,400
who does that? I'll tell you who
does that chesty puller. Does that

468
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:11,820
pull polars career as a guerrilla fighter
now opened in earnest in February,

469
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:16,260
1930 he was ordered to clear bandits
from the area of San Antonio. Bill Lee,

470
00:30:16,261 --> 00:30:18,720
who had earlier served
three years in Nicaragua,

471
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:21,570
had been pleading for a chance to return.
Lee was a tall,

472
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:26,571
muscular athlete from Massachusetts
who had been 16 years and the corn was

473
00:30:26,821 --> 00:30:29,310
conditioned by years of
playing fullback on the team,

474
00:30:29,311 --> 00:30:34,230
have a coal burning coal
burning battleship and by
boxing and pulling an oar on

475
00:30:34,231 --> 00:30:35,760
a crew puller,

476
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,880
unhesitatingly chose him to help direct
company m and Lee and Lewis found and

477
00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:46,330
Lee found Lewis an ideal commander.
This is,

478
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:50,610
this is classic. He, this is what
Lee says about his commander,

479
00:30:50,611 --> 00:30:54,300
which is chesty puller.
He never really gave me orders.

480
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,820
He just told me what headquarters wanted,

481
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,990
asked me if I knew the country
and to get up the men we needed.

482
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:06,120
He was a common sense officer and you
always knew where you stood with him when

483
00:31:06,121 --> 00:31:07,980
he was displeased about
something I'd done.

484
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:12,450
He never chewed me out as so many
inexperienced officers would have done.

485
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:16,410
He would say, if I had been doing
that, I'd have done it this way.

486
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,110
Yeah,

487
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:22,730
and that would be the end of it. We got
all my brothers most important of all.

488
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,100
He was not green.
When he first came to Nicaragua,

489
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:28,550
Haiti had taught them jungle fighting
and he took the to the new country like a

490
00:31:28,551 --> 00:31:33,290
native.
That paragraph right there is just,

491
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,660
it's so important,
especially again,

492
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,700
when people get the image of a marine
and of chesty puller that he's just going

493
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:43,250
to whip everyone into shape. Like
no, that's not a good leader.

494
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,720
That is not a good leader.

495
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,241
Back to the book,

496
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:56,241
General Magee Mcdougal recommended polar
for a navy cross citing five fights

497
00:31:57,091 --> 00:31:59,050
against, so this is after he's
been there for a little sighting,

498
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:02,040
five fights and get superior
numbers without loss to himself.

499
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:07,100
The nine known enemy dead and numerous
but uncounted wounded and the impressive

500
00:32:07,771 --> 00:32:12,540
loot of munitions, an animal's food
and captured military dispatches.

501
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:18,210
The recommendation ended ended thus by
his intelligent and forceful leadership

502
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:23,640
without thought of his own personal
safety by great physical exertion and by

503
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,170
suffering many hardships.

504
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:30,240
He surmounted all obstacles and dealt
five successive and severe blows against

505
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:33,480
organized banditry and
the Republic of Nicaragua.

506
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:38,340
So there you go. That's what he's
getting after down in Nicaragua.

507
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,370
Here's a another captain,
he Lindsey [inaudible],

508
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,150
who was the intelligence officer in the,
in the marine brigade.

509
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:50,480
He saw that some of the
people were jealous, so he,

510
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:53,750
so he started getting a little bit famous.
People started writing about them.

511
00:32:53,751 --> 00:32:57,050
There was an article in the New York
Times about them and people started having

512
00:32:57,051 --> 00:32:59,060
some professional
jealousy back to the book.

513
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:03,830
This is Lynn sat talking now and then
from New York Times now and then the New

514
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:07,280
York Times got some of these stories
from Nicaraguan papers and polars name

515
00:33:07,281 --> 00:33:08,540
became widely known.

516
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:13,370
A few officers around headquarters who
thought of themselves as clouds of types,

517
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:17,090
muttered criticisms of polar and
said he was a publicity hound.

518
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:22,430
I knew that the opposite was true and
that Louis spent virtually his whole life

519
00:33:22,431 --> 00:33:25,370
in this period on the trail
deepened enemy country.

520
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,110
While our staff officer friends,

521
00:33:27,111 --> 00:33:31,640
sob sat on their duffs in the
cities far removed from the warfare,

522
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:36,470
but you get that professional jealousy.
There's a classic example of it.

523
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:42,230
Here's a General Julien Smith
talking about Louis Polar.

524
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,440
He was probably the
bravest man I ever knew.

525
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,690
His was a cool courage.

526
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,720
Not One of desperation about the only
way to contact the enemy there was to let

527
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:55,280
them ambush him.

528
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:58,580
He would go anywhere without support
knowing that if he got in a jam,

529
00:33:58,581 --> 00:34:03,530
he had to get himself out. He never
hesitated. He invited that kind of work.

530
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,100
He's getting after it.

531
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:14,310
Uh, he went home for a little while.
He visited his younger brother,

532
00:34:14,311 --> 00:34:18,290
Sam, who is also a second
lieutenant in the marine corps,

533
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,860
and then polar landed in one
of the army infantry schools.

534
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,560
The armature,
he army's infantry school.

535
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:29,930
He went to that school while he was there,

536
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:36,650
sometimes had some
disagreements with the staff.

537
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:38,990
Here's one.

538
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:42,110
One lecturer told the students that
volume of fire in the field was more

539
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:45,170
important than accuracy that
brought polar to his feet.

540
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,990
You must have forgotten what happened
in the American revolution. He said,

541
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:50,180
we won that war with accurate fire.

542
00:34:50,181 --> 00:34:55,181
When the enemy had all the volume it
wanted king's mountain and Saratoga and

543
00:34:55,911 --> 00:34:57,620
every other battle we won,

544
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:02,950
and real shooting almost whipped the mass
firing federal army in the civil war.

545
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:07,370
It's still like that anywhere.
I've seen men shooting it out.

546
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,370
You don't hurt them if you don't hit him.

547
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,580
Great Point. Even though suppressive
fires, awesome and massive volume of fire,

548
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,460
definitely. We'll keep the enemy
down. Heads down. You got to hit him.

549
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:22,183
That's,

550
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,690
you know I've talked about this before
but that's like why in Ramadi our machine

551
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:30,470
gunners were putting, put, putting
scopes on their machine guns, which is,

552
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:34,670
I mean they're part of partially doing
it for to be able to identify who they

553
00:35:34,671 --> 00:35:37,590
were looking at positively identify enemy
looking for weapons cause you've got a

554
00:35:37,591 --> 00:35:38,940
little magnification on your scope.

555
00:35:38,941 --> 00:35:41,340
But still they also wanted to like
hit what they were shooting at.

556
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:44,970
Obviously our snipers riflemen
were doing that too. But yeah,

557
00:35:44,971 --> 00:35:47,400
you got to hit what's your, you got
to hit so you got to hit the bad guys.

558
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:49,780
Yeah.

559
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,990
Back to the book. And as he was at Ben,
he was at that school at, at Fort Benning,

560
00:35:52,991 --> 00:35:55,480
Louis left bending with many
new friends and all services.

561
00:35:55,481 --> 00:36:00,310
But most important carried away a
distrust of overscheduling military men.

562
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,740
Here's polar talking.

563
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:07,400
The trouble with this school business
is that we've taken it too far.

564
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:12,440
We sit around in classrooms and we'll,
the conditions of battle, of course,

565
00:36:12,441 --> 00:36:16,130
an actual battle. You can't,
we'll anything, not a damn thing,

566
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:20,510
because the enemy will do what you don't
want him to do or expect them to do

567
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,560
almost every time.

568
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,610
Then the results of actual warfare
studied back in the schools,

569
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,660
the staff officers and planners most
in most of whom have never seen real

570
00:36:29,661 --> 00:36:32,930
battles. Wonder what went
wrong with their neat plants.

571
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,810
You just simply cannot learn warfare in
a school room or anywhere else except in

572
00:36:38,811 --> 00:36:39,644
combat,

573
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:43,610
and you'll never know whether you're a
fighting man until you're under fire.

574
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,873
Yeah,

575
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,980
he goes back to Nicaragua after that.

576
00:36:58,730 --> 00:36:59,060
Okay.

577
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,541
Back to the book.

578
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:04,370
Throughout the latter half of 1932
company M was on unceasing patrol,

579
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,790
averaging 18 to 20 miles
daily on the mountain trails,

580
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,730
stretching it some days too,
as much as 40 miles

581
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:17,860
polar and Lee and their troops marched
more than 10,000 miles in the Nicaragua

582
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:22,270
fighting always on foot for the early
discovered that horseman drew fire in

583
00:37:22,271 --> 00:37:23,230
every skirmish,

584
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,060
and so they walked without the
mark of officer on their uniforms.

585
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,300
Okay.

586
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,740
10,000 miles.

587
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,420
Okay.

588
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:38,290
On schedule on January 20 on January 2nd,

589
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:41,200
1933 the marines began leaving Nicaragua.

590
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,710
Yeah.

591
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:45,830
In February,
1933

592
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:47,530
okay.

593
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:51,190
Louis was introduced to
military society and peaking

594
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:52,910
okay.

595
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:56,870
At the u s legation,
his commander pinned on his chest,

596
00:37:56,871 --> 00:38:00,040
the Star for the navy cross
you'd want to Nicaragua. So he,

597
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:02,150
he won another navy cross.

598
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,410
Less than a month later he
took over the Horse Marines.

599
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,530
Louis discovered that the 600 man,

600
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:14,940
u s marine battalion held only one field
exercise each week and this was called

601
00:38:15,951 --> 00:38:19,100
off in extreme heat or
cold or a dust storm,

602
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:22,730
but that the Japanese did not cancel
their training marches for any reason.

603
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,340
He put his horse marines
through their paces daily,

604
00:38:25,341 --> 00:38:26,960
excluding Saturdays and Sundays,

605
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,890
leading them on long cross country rides
with small dust storms boiling in their

606
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:33,050
wake.
He wrote into areas where Japanese,

607
00:38:33,051 --> 00:38:36,070
we're training in an effort to observe
their details and our tactical work.

608
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,520
So he came home and take over and we're
just going to tighten things up a little

609
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:43,480
bit. One training exercise
a month? No, daily.

610
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:48,700
We're switching to daily. Back to the
book. Lewis never forgot Virginia Evans.

611
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:52,120
That was the girl from the dance and
faithfully wrote her of his experiences in

612
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,470
China.
In one letter,

613
00:38:53,471 --> 00:38:58,030
he wrote so emphatically that you could
almost see him blurting out the words he

614
00:38:58,031 --> 00:39:02,500
wanted to hear.
He wanted to say to her,

615
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:07,540
but dear, even if you do marry me
and make me a happy man, even then,

616
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:13,330
if I hear the beat of the drum, I must
leave you. I want you to know that

617
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:19,450
she's not even married to him yet.
She's not even married to him yet.

618
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,650
And he's like, Hey, you know, that's great
if you marry me and make me happy, man,

619
00:39:23,651 --> 00:39:25,390
that's awesome.
But if I hear that beat of the drum,

620
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:29,140
I'm out going to do what I gotta do.

621
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:35,703
Okay,

622
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:39,890
here's another he,
he got in trouble.

623
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,420
He got in trouble a lot because
he didn't hold his tongue

624
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:49,010
and you're supposed to hold
your tongue, right? And he did.

625
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,860
That's why so many people loved him.

626
00:39:51,861 --> 00:39:55,070
It's also why he got professional jealousy
and it's also why he got in trouble

627
00:39:55,071 --> 00:39:58,040
sometimes. Here's one example. Example.

628
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:03,550
Polar was aware of some American military
errors on board the Augusta and he

629
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:06,980
never failed to expose them and
talks with his, with his intimates.

630
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:12,580
Here we have a 10,000 ton heavy cruiser
with about 800 men aboard just one on

631
00:40:14,451 --> 00:40:16,400
the Asiatic station.

632
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,520
The British have three
cruisers on duty here.

633
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:24,140
You ever notice that we have
37 typewriters on this ship?

634
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,770
The British have just one machine
on each of their cruisers.

635
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,630
Why do you suppose that is?

636
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,350
You know damn well they don't read all
those reports back in Washington when

637
00:40:33,351 --> 00:40:37,460
they get their paperwork
will ruin any military force.

638
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:39,560
They should have learned
that from Smedley Butler.

639
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,910
They'll shed this monstrosity
when war comes though.

640
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,070
And the fighting people will take over.

641
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:55,210
So he doesn't like the paperwork. He
doesn't eat any. You can see he does.

642
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,540
The people that haven't fought,
that's who he's talking about.

643
00:40:58,541 --> 00:40:59,860
People that don't fight,

644
00:40:59,861 --> 00:41:03,820
they're the people that create paperwork
cause they don't understand how

645
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,560
negative and affects everyone.

646
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,920
So they create this stupid paperwork and
he ends up going to the basic school,

647
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:18,840
which is like the officer where the
officers sort of get trained in all the

648
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:20,590
fundamental principles of combat.

649
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,553
Hmm.

650
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,850
For the Marine Corps. And he ended up
being an instructor there. Here we go.

651
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:29,120
Back to the book. This is coming
from a guy named Lou. Walt

652
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:36,950
polar was my commander and to me was
the epitome of what the Murray of what

653
00:41:36,951 --> 00:41:38,390
Marine Corps training should do.

654
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,540
Not only in weapons or
classroom or field training.

655
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:46,310
He gave us everything hard at every break
in the field though he drove us until

656
00:41:46,311 --> 00:41:49,460
our tongues were hanging out.
Men still gathered around him.

657
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:54,080
He told us tales about fighting in Haiti
and Nicaragua of this patrols living

658
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:57,470
off the land and fighting natives.
All his experiences,

659
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:02,030
not just guff.
Every tail had some point.

660
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:07,580
Being under polar in basic school did
more for me than anything I experienced

661
00:42:07,581 --> 00:42:11,660
until I got to Guadalcanal.
He taught us use of terrain,

662
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:15,440
like a master, how to use the tiniest
bit of covered it to our advantage.

663
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:18,350
Ground form really meant
something when he explained it.

664
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,100
He taught us to use the Bayer net with
all the tricks of close in fighting.

665
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:26,630
You couldn't mistake it. He
knew his stuff cold. So again,

666
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,840
classic example of when People Think,
Oh,

667
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,500
if I'm nicer and I take
it easy on the truth,

668
00:42:33,501 --> 00:42:35,720
they'll like me more like wrong answer.

669
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,733
Hmm.

670
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:38,683
Wrong answer.

671
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:45,330
Back to the book on a freezing rain
swept day just before polars marriage,

672
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:50,100
the class of 1937 it had an uncomfortable
experience with him on the drill field

673
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:54,780
they wore nor no overcoats as
they marched. Teeth shattered,

674
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,670
but the ranks moved with precision.

675
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:01,050
Lewis saw stray glances at
the barracks detachment,

676
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,070
which came out for a brief drill
wrapped and heavy overcoats and then

677
00:43:05,071 --> 00:43:08,160
disappeared.
Those our barracks marines,

678
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:10,500
he said with a z with
an edge in his voice,

679
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,880
your fighting marines being completed,
the full schedule for the day,

680
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:17,190
chilled to the bone and soaking wet.

681
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:23,730
So legit,
that's it's solid yet.

682
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,860
And he got married and here we go.

683
00:43:28,861 --> 00:43:31,770
The pullers left the pleasant life of
Philadelphia Navy Yard in the spring of

684
00:43:31,771 --> 00:43:34,200
1939 nine bound for the Orient.

685
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:39,630
They had a few days in Hawaii and went
to Waikiki one morning to ride surfboards

686
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:43,260
with another young friend,
Lieutenant Gordon Warner,

687
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:46,470
a champion swimmer who had studied
under Louis at the basic school.

688
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,330
The two men went out to see in a
canoe and to Virginia's astonishment,

689
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:55,460
Lewis road in with Wagner balancing with
his balancing with skill as rollers.

690
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,480
Harold them towards the shore.

691
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:02,760
Lewis then returned and rode in on a
surf board alone and turned to Virginia.

692
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,250
Come on,
you're going to try it too.

693
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:10,250
You never had so much fun chesty
puller getting some of that stoke.

694
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,570
Awesome. I just had to
bring that out, right.

695
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:20,940
Even chesty puller like
there's a little bit of stoke.

696
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,073
Hmm.

697
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,620
Back to the book with a little further
delay. Lewis got what he saw for himself.

698
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,530
He would report to the new Marine base
in North Carolina swamp lands at River

699
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:34,740
where he would command the first battalion
seventh marines and prepare them for

700
00:44:34,741 --> 00:44:38,060
war. So obviously Pearl Harbor takes
place and he heads back to the states to

701
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,500
takeover the one seven marines

702
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,490
were the battalion returned
from the field late afternoon.

703
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:50,640
Polar called a conference of his company
officers. Gentlemen, my name's polar,

704
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,940
your new commander. We have a
good deal of work to do together.

705
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:56,070
I'll be slow to make changes,

706
00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:00,780
but one of them begins tomorrow at the
first rest period after we leave camp

707
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:03,450
camouflage every man and
every piece of equipment,

708
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:08,310
we've got no camouflage material.
Major. Well Dude. Anyways,

709
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:10,380
the best is in the field.

710
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:14,460
Find a mod whole smear motto and your
face is enhance twigs on helmets and

711
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:18,330
blouses. Anywhere you can stick them.
Pine foliage is good, you'll learn.

712
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,070
The battalion began with
marches of 12 miles daily.

713
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:24,970
Okay.

714
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:27,310
This was pushed to 15 and then 20 miles.

715
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:30,400
Pull her punctuated drills
with fight talks to his men.

716
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:31,860
Okay.

717
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,830
They were very young. Many of them. Beard,

718
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:36,690
this boys under 16 who must
have lied about their ages.

719
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,770
They were the most obscene. The
profane men polar had ever encountered.

720
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:42,840
Edward L.
Smith,

721
00:45:42,841 --> 00:45:46,800
a young battalion doctor educated at
Yale and Harvard confessed that the

722
00:45:46,801 --> 00:45:50,080
constant flow of filthy
language actually sick and him.

723
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:51,743
Okay.

724
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:59,540
Now we had some guys that were marching
and some of them followed fallout from

725
00:45:59,581 --> 00:46:03,300
the heat and he wrote it and
the major polar comes by.

726
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:07,290
When you were marching this morning I
heard a marine or the roadside say there

727
00:46:07,291 --> 00:46:10,740
goes the God damn seventh regiment.
I was amazed.

728
00:46:10,741 --> 00:46:13,320
One of you didn't step out of
ranks and knock him out cold.

729
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:17,343
Okay.

730
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:22,450
One of his privates, Gerald Wyatt,
a Yale man from Eastport Maine,

731
00:46:22,451 --> 00:46:27,280
also a diarist began to take note
of polar. He is never obscene.

732
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:31,750
Remarkably for the vigor with which he
handles us. He has toughened demands,

733
00:46:31,751 --> 00:46:32,650
the outmost,

734
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:36,580
but there was always a kindly approach
even when he is chewing you out,

735
00:46:36,581 --> 00:46:38,740
the displays a touching sympathy.

736
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:41,733
Again,

737
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:45,740
this is what, this is what we're trying
to do as leaders. Balance that dichotomy.

738
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:46,723
Hmm.

739
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:54,590
Here's polar talking to his troops.
One more thing.

740
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,220
Whenever we are at Chow,
the privates will be fed first.

741
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:03,820
Then the non coms and officer's last of
all typical taking care of the troops

742
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:10,070
when they were toughing to that. Oh,
this is it. When they're there. Um,

743
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:12,383
okay.

744
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:17,450
Doing Calisthenics and all their marches
and here we go back to the book when

745
00:47:18,241 --> 00:47:21,300
they were tough to that polar put
them through a series of night marches

746
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:22,560
beginning after midnight.

747
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:26,310
The doctor's like others learn to read
maps and campuses and to handle weapons,

748
00:47:26,311 --> 00:47:29,740
including mortars. The practice
of identifying ships and planes.

749
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,500
A joke in most units
became a serious business.

750
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:35,920
In one seven some medics
learned Morse Code and Manila,

751
00:47:35,921 --> 00:47:40,810
John Basel owned an army trained veteran
machine gunner traded semaphore lessons

752
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,700
for instruction and first aid.

753
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:45,050
Okay.

754
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:47,240
Had to bring up that we had Manila John.

755
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,810
It's like unbelievable man that this

756
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,930
stories are just unbelievable.
Here's,

757
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:59,740
here's another very cool a situation.

758
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:05,190
This young lieutenant was practicing
some kind of an assault and he gets a

759
00:48:05,411 --> 00:48:10,030
little complicated and and polars what
pulled our calls. Everyone is old man.

760
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,700
Whether they're older than him or younger,
he calls everyone old man,

761
00:48:12,701 --> 00:48:15,430
which is pretty funny. So here we go.
Paul was talking to this young lieutenant,

762
00:48:15,431 --> 00:48:19,660
old man, there's mighty little room
for fancy tackers below division level,

763
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:24,340
the enemy or on the hill. You go get
them. In the end you'll save men.

764
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,960
There are times when
you will have to flank,

765
00:48:25,961 --> 00:48:28,870
but don't forget that the shortest
distance between two points is a straight

766
00:48:28,871 --> 00:48:29,704
line.

767
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:33,043
Get some.

768
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:39,420
I always talk about flanking
and I'm a big believer,

769
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:42,060
Jesse polar says, hey,
sometimes you've got to flank,

770
00:48:42,061 --> 00:48:45,120
but sometimes you got to
go get some straight line.

771
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,560
Here's another important
thing. He, there's a,

772
00:48:49,561 --> 00:48:53,550
there's a a colonel that's
running artillery training
and he goes and talks to

773
00:48:53,551 --> 00:48:55,770
him. Colonel, you'll be starting
artillery training next week.

774
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:58,140
I want you to let me know when,
when your fire,

775
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:03,290
I want to get my troops under it as
often as I can and the colonel said there

776
00:49:03,931 --> 00:49:07,680
may be accidents and fuller
says we can chance those.

777
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:11,910
What I won't chance is taking a bunch of
green kids to war before they know the

778
00:49:11,911 --> 00:49:16,410
sound of big guns. I know shells aren't
the same going in and coming out,

779
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,760
but this will help.

780
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:20,110
Okay,

781
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:24,490
so he wanted to get down, right?
They're all under the sound of the guns.

782
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:27,580
Hmm. Lieutenant Cox. Now,

783
00:49:27,581 --> 00:49:32,581
the executive of a company was
impressed by pro polars thoroughness.

784
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,800
Major polar never stood aside and said,
carry on sergeant,

785
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:41,050
and most often other officers did.
He was in there with us packing all.

786
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,190
He could walk down the best of us,
even the kids, other commanders,

787
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,190
road cars in the woods,
but not polar.

788
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:53,953
Okay,

789
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:58,140
here's another journal entry private
Gerald White wrote for his diary.

790
00:49:58,141 --> 00:50:01,560
Polar must've marched twice the
distance we did for all day long.

791
00:50:01,561 --> 00:50:05,280
He kept marching up and down the column.
John as a Bantam Rooster,

792
00:50:05,281 --> 00:50:07,740
pipe clinched in his teeth.
Ever alert to see that,

793
00:50:07,741 --> 00:50:12,390
who to see that men who were succumbing
to the heat exhaustion or blisters were

794
00:50:12,391 --> 00:50:16,680
taken care of by Korman many
times today I saw him take a bar,

795
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:20,010
which is browning automatic rifle.
It's a big machine gun, a bar machine,

796
00:50:20,011 --> 00:50:24,360
gun or mortar off the shoulder of some
marine who's Fannie was dragging and

797
00:50:24,361 --> 00:50:26,670
carry it to give the
poor guy some respites.

798
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,490
Here's another situation again,
good dichotomy here.

799
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:37,780
Somebody that he finds somebody
asleep on watch, which by the way,

800
00:50:37,781 --> 00:50:42,100
it's like an incredibly horrible thing,
which you can get severely punished for.

801
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:45,070
Back to the book,
polar shook the boy wake old man.

802
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,500
It's dangerous to pull a trick like this.

803
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,280
Suppose captain Rogers had caught you eat,
made a big fuss,

804
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:54,010
and then I'd have to court martial
you and slap you into the brick.

805
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:57,820
Maybe that's what I should do.
But I'll give you another chance.

806
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:01,090
Pretty soon now we'll
be fighting for keeps

807
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:05,220
and you'll still stay awake or
risk the lives of every one of us.

808
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:09,030
You understand me?
So I mean talk about it.

809
00:51:09,031 --> 00:51:13,560
Way To endear yourself to the
troops. That's so awesome. Hey,

810
00:51:13,561 --> 00:51:17,250
if the cap mortar caught you,
then would have been a big fuss.

811
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:21,660
Luckily I caught you.
Polar was,

812
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:23,550
so they deployed overseas.

813
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:24,310
Okay.

814
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:26,290
Polar was promoted to
lieutenant colonel on Samoa.

815
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:29,500
He wrote to his wife.

816
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:30,630
Okay.

817
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:31,770
Life is so short.

818
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:33,020
Yeah.

819
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:36,890
And when I was a child,
I thought it would last forever and ever.

820
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:37,570
Yeah.

821
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:40,960
My love for you will Virginia
even into the next life.

822
00:51:40,961 --> 00:51:44,470
And then on the hardest thing that
I've ever done was tell you goodbye.

823
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:48,460
That was a black Tuesday and I pray
they will never be another separation.

824
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:56,580
Yeah, you're not right. You know they're
going, they're heading into a Guadalcanal,

825
00:51:56,850 --> 00:52:00,240
so that's going to make everyone
think life can get pretty short.

826
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:01,853
Hm.

827
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:03,501
Back to the book.

828
00:52:03,501 --> 00:52:07,330
Fire came from the sea where Japanese
ships stood close in on challenged and

829
00:52:07,331 --> 00:52:08,151
battered the area.

830
00:52:08,151 --> 00:52:11,810
Much of the grove was cone by flying
fragments and men screamed in agony.

831
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:15,170
Trees were torn and broken and
many tumbled to the ground.

832
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:18,303
Okay.

833
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,220
People reported hearing general
polar or at this time colonel polar.

834
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:26,720
It's all right man. Stay down and they
can't hurt you. This won't last forever.

835
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,870
Tomorrow will be our turn,
so they're just getting paid.

836
00:52:29,871 --> 00:52:33,290
Landed on the beach and they're
just getting hammered with

837
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:39,460
Jap from Japanese ships.
Big artillery from the big naval guns.

838
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,753
Okay.

839
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:44,460
The battalion left that left
the perimeter that afternoon.

840
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:46,350
A file of more than 800 men.

841
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:47,920
Okay.

842
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,400
The tail of the battalion had
hardly cleared the perimeter
when there was firing

843
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:53,980
ahead. Captain Hayes was near
the colonel. At the moment.

844
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,440
Every man hit the deck except Pauler.

845
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:57,920
Yeah.

846
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,750
We dive for the growth beside the trail,

847
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:03,080
but he walked up and down the line
talking as if he were on parade.

848
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:06,290
He told us it was all right,
and this has nothing to worry about.

849
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:09,680
Just small stuff. We began to
get up again. Then in there,

850
00:53:09,681 --> 00:53:14,270
he commanded that battalion as it
never imagined it could be commanded.

851
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:15,440
Okay.

852
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,440
The men saw what kind of man they had
and the word went down the column as fast

853
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:23,780
as light.
We lost our fear or some of it

854
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:30,510
on a grassy knoll above the tangle
where the Knights Bivouac was planned.

855
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:35,250
The call column met an ambush to
Bob Haggerty's platoon were killed.

856
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:40,200
Two of Bob Haggerty's platoon were
killed and the unit broken a tiny groups

857
00:53:40,201 --> 00:53:44,280
leaving Haggerty without a command.
He lane cover and watched polar.

858
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:49,530
It was the greatest exhibition of utter
disregard for Personal Safety I ever saw.

859
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:58,460
He definitely,
like I said,

860
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:03,140
whatever that officer was in Haiti that
told them, don't show fear under fire.

861
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,850
He took that one to the bank.

862
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:07,860
Okay.

863
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,750
Back to the book of runner.
Just be this. Again,

864
00:54:09,751 --> 00:54:12,420
I'm jumping around just from
different combat scenarios.

865
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,480
A runner just behind polar was hit
in the throat and died quickly.

866
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:17,670
Everyone else hit the ground
except for colonel polar.

867
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:21,180
First Sergeant William Pennington
retained a vivid memory of the moment.

868
00:54:21,181 --> 00:54:24,390
The colonel stood there and that grazing
fire with that little old stump of a

869
00:54:24,391 --> 00:54:27,660
pipe in his face yelling be company.
Second platoon in line,

870
00:54:27,661 --> 00:54:29,670
hear machine gun fire kicked up,

871
00:54:29,671 --> 00:54:33,690
dust all around me and I stayed down in
that knee high Kunai grass like everyone

872
00:54:33,691 --> 00:54:34,590
else in the ranks.

873
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,160
He was the only marine you could
see standing on that hillside.

874
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,900
Get this. Here we go. A
grenade fell near the old man.

875
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,860
No more than eight yards away.
Captain Sat,

876
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:53,970
Captain Zach Cox estimated but polar
turned when he saw a company scatter and

877
00:54:54,511 --> 00:54:57,000
yelled,
oh that damn thing ain't going off.

878
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,630
It helped to steady the men.
The grenade was a dud.

879
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:06,723
Yeah,

880
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,940
so they get done.
They're kind of like a situation.

881
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,220
First few days of
fighting back to the book.

882
00:55:15,221 --> 00:55:17,740
Polars battalion had
24 dead and 23 wounded.

883
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:22,060
The next day back into main
defense line of the perimeter.

884
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,490
He called together the
battalion officer's.

885
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:28,570
His voice was hard and his
face on smiling. Gentlemen,

886
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,820
at least we've all been blooded.
Now,

887
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:35,320
I don't want you to be mooning over our
losses and feeling sorry for yourselves

888
00:55:35,321 --> 00:55:37,510
or taking all the blame on your shoulders.

889
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:42,460
We've all got to leave this world someday.
We're all in the same pickle.

890
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,670
Then there are worse things
than dying for your country.

891
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,340
Some things about our action
in the last four days,

892
00:55:48,341 --> 00:55:52,600
I want you to remember forever.
There are some we'd all like to forget,

893
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:56,380
but there'll be in your mind's
eye as long as you live.

894
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:00,040
I hope we've all learned something now.

895
00:56:00,041 --> 00:56:04,210
Take care of your men and make yourselves
ready. We haven't seen anything yet.

896
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,830
One other thing back there on
the hillside at Mount Austin,

897
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:11,410
I had trouble getting company officers up.

898
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:15,970
I hope you saw that costs us casualties.
Never do.

899
00:56:15,971 --> 00:56:19,870
I want to see that again in my command.
I want to see officers leading.

900
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:24,730
I want you to know that your
leaders and not simply commanders,

901
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,170
you cannot operate a military force in
the field under these conditions with

902
00:56:29,171 --> 00:56:33,560
commanders alone. Civilians wouldn't
know what I was talking about,

903
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,010
but you found out now that it's true,
there aren't many qualities in a man,

904
00:56:37,011 --> 00:56:41,630
but one that is absolutely necessary
in an infantry leader is stark courage.

905
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:44,750
Give that idea to your
men and your own way.

906
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:51,160
Don't worry over the things that are done
that we can no longer help concentrate

907
00:56:51,171 --> 00:56:55,910
on building a better combat uner unit
because that's the best hope of all of us

908
00:56:55,911 --> 00:56:56,744
surviving.

909
00:56:57,470 --> 00:57:00,410
None of us could help the fact that I
was the only combat train man and our

910
00:57:00,411 --> 00:57:04,220
outfit when we began. I was lucky
enough to get the jolt when I was young.

911
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:07,850
You'll come along fast and
there'll be work for us.

912
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:10,310
Let's be ready when our time comes.

913
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:18,150
Yeah, that's, that's, that's,
I haven't really heard that
point, but you know what?

914
00:57:18,151 --> 00:57:20,860
You need to hear people talk
about leaders and managers,

915
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:26,110
and I've worked with companies in it and
it's a good, a good sentiment, right? Hey,

916
00:57:26,111 --> 00:57:29,310
RP, our leaders aren't our leaders, our
leaders, they're not managers. Yeah.

917
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:33,370
Well this is an interesting one of say,
look, it's not not commanders, leaders,

918
00:57:33,371 --> 00:57:34,204
not commanders,

919
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,690
and that if you think about the
difference between commander's meeting,

920
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:40,110
I'm going to come in and you want to
do is I'm going to lead the very, very

921
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:41,260
cool,
uh,

922
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,090
distinction between those two words.

923
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:51,580
Back to the book. He still missed
nothing involving the morale of his men,

924
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,290
Reagan Fuller,

925
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:57,340
who began to feel the stark drama of the
situation after the first severe fight

926
00:57:57,341 --> 00:58:01,540
grew a beard and swaggered around the
perimeter like a desperado polar took him

927
00:58:01,541 --> 00:58:05,800
aside. Oh man, you're carried
away with this war business.

928
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:08,740
You're feeling too self important
about it. That's dangerous.

929
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:11,350
This is just a matter
of kill or be killed.

930
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,260
I got to read that again.

931
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:19,380
This is just a matter of kill or be killed
and we've got to stay on our toes to

932
00:58:20,441 --> 00:58:24,340
have a chance. Clean yourself
up. Here's some shaving gear.

933
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,790
And when you're through, you can take
a drink from that bottle if you like.

934
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:35,270
Again,
like

935
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,140
connecting with your troops
and recognizing that a
guy starting to do like go

936
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:43,140
sideways a little bit and pull
him aside and talking to them.

937
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:45,800
Okay,

938
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:49,770
all right. Now again, they're
just engaged in a fierce battle.

939
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:54,270
This point back to the book at the peak
of this polar had a telephone call from

940
00:58:54,271 --> 00:58:56,310
the regimental commander
in the rear polar.

941
00:58:56,311 --> 00:58:59,010
We've got to change in order to
execute a reconnaissance enforced.

942
00:58:59,011 --> 00:59:03,330
When your battalion along the coast
road do not become involved in a large

943
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:06,630
action, be prepared to withdraw
to maintain communications.

944
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:11,850
Reagan fuller was within earshot
of polar as polar shouted in rage.

945
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,510
How the hell can I make a reconnaissance
when we're engaged down to the last man,

946
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:17,160
we're fighting tooth and nail.
Man,

947
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,610
if you'd get off your duff and
come up here where the fighting is,

948
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,070
you could the situation.

949
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,233
Boom.

950
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:28,551
Again,

951
00:59:28,551 --> 00:59:33,551
this is why he wasn't always super
popular up the chain of command because he

952
00:59:33,831 --> 00:59:37,260
spoke the truth sometimes in the most,

953
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:38,900
not the most tactful way.

954
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:41,223
Yeah.

955
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:46,270
Now polars battalion actually ends up
getting the upper hand there and he gets

956
00:59:47,691 --> 00:59:49,490
them kind of pin down in.

957
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:50,970
Okay.

958
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:55,530
Crushes him back to the book when it was
over the regimental headquarters called

959
00:59:55,531 --> 00:59:59,760
back relieving polar of any necessity of
a reconnaissance patrol and permitting

960
00:59:59,761 --> 01:00:03,180
him to return to the perimeter.
There was also a call from Hannah Akin,

961
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:08,510
a request to bring back is wounded polars
men carried in all casualties from the

962
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:09,504
two battalion.

963
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,770
Two Battalions Pours Battalion
had five dead and 21 wounded.

964
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:18,120
Total losses were 65 dead in
125 wounded for the operation.

965
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,380
Polar estimated that the enemy losses
to be at least five times that that,

966
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:27,120
but it was later revealed
that the Japanese fourth
infantry had lost almost an

967
01:00:27,121 --> 01:00:31,770
entire battalion with 690 dead.
The result of polar strike in the crater.

968
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,240
Okay.

969
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,280
Now,
like I said,

970
01:00:36,281 --> 01:00:41,281
he speaks his mind and
remember I mentioned Colonel
Vandergriff who we worked

971
01:00:43,451 --> 01:00:45,250
for when he was a young lieutenant,
will now have a colonel.

972
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:50,020
Vandergriff is a general and general
Vandergriff that they're having a little

973
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:53,710
conversation back to the book.
The whole process was asinine.

974
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:57,910
The mixed up outfits as
badly as they possibly could.

975
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:03,060
There was no overall commander division
gave orders to skin wailing and me.

976
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:06,220
Whaling was senior,
but orders did not come through him.

977
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:09,310
My regimental commander was
behind the river and not on scene.

978
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:12,280
Thus when they found two battalion
stopped cold in the fight,

979
01:01:12,281 --> 01:01:13,480
communications were so bad.

980
01:01:13,481 --> 01:01:18,010
They pulled these two outfits and left
me to face all the enemy. We were blind,

981
01:01:18,011 --> 01:01:19,450
lucky to come out as we did.

982
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:23,800
Imagine them ordering me to go on some
damn reconnaissance when I was fighting

983
01:01:23,801 --> 01:01:25,150
with every man I had.

984
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:30,310
Proper designation of authority would
have made everything clear. Boom.

985
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:35,230
There you go. Yup. Proper
designation of authority.

986
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:39,220
People need to know who's in charge
and you need to put someone in charge.

987
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:42,880
That's the way it's got to work.
Hmm. When you don't have that,

988
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:45,520
you get confused and you get issues.
Now there's a,

989
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:48,370
there's like a field doctor there.

990
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:54,820
Dr. Smith noted in his diary that pullers
seemed more concerned over losses.

991
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:58,870
He's become almost fanatical and his
desire to see that men are properly cared

992
01:01:58,871 --> 01:02:00,550
for.
If a man's body has lost,

993
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:04,270
he is greatly disturbed and frets about
the time lost before he can recover the

994
01:02:04,271 --> 01:02:06,220
body and give it a decent burial.

995
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,593
There you go.

996
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,410
There was one on pleasant matter,

997
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:19,770
a young Philadelphian who had earlier
been a disciplinary problem on Samoa,

998
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:23,940
had failed the colonel on the crater
march, polar called Jim Hayes,

999
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:24,631
the legal officer.

1000
01:02:24,631 --> 01:02:28,110
I want you to have hers
tried for dereliction of duty
in the face of the enemy.

1001
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:31,800
He threw away his load a mortar shells
because it was too heavy and he costs me

1002
01:02:31,801 --> 01:02:34,500
the lives of several men.
Damn his time.

1003
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,550
I'll draw a recommendation.
I'm going to have him shot.

1004
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:44,343
Okay.

1005
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:48,510
And I don't think I cover it.
It's it.

1006
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:52,030
The reason I pointed that out or I
covered that is cause that guy redeems

1007
01:02:52,031 --> 01:02:56,800
himself in the future. And it's one
of the times where polar says, okay,

1008
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:01,210
you're good. He does some
incredibly brave and crazy things.

1009
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:03,610
All right, so here we
go. Back to the book.

1010
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:07,150
The major Japanese attack was expected.

1011
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:12,210
What's expected along the Matton cow in
most of the division strength was placed

1012
01:03:14,921 --> 01:03:18,310
there. The Japanese moved to attack
these positions on October 15th

1013
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:19,690
okay.

1014
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:21,080
With the second division,

1015
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:24,100
with a Japanese second division assigned
to swing forward and live in hit the

1016
01:03:24,101 --> 01:03:28,000
marines from the south in an area where
polars men unweighted nine infantry

1017
01:03:28,001 --> 01:03:32,590
battalion set out on this March total of
5,600 men excluding artillery and other

1018
01:03:32,591 --> 01:03:35,350
support troops. The soldiers
carried or dragged everything,

1019
01:03:35,351 --> 01:03:37,390
even guns over the rough trails.

1020
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,100
They were late in making their attack
and abandoned many guns on the trail.

1021
01:03:40,101 --> 01:03:42,970
So the Japanese are coming in.
They're coming aggressively.

1022
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:45,530
Okay.

1023
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:50,210
A company was weaker by one platoon in
the other companies for despite protests

1024
01:03:50,211 --> 01:03:54,290
of Croner polar,
there was an outpost of 46 of its men,

1025
01:03:54,291 --> 01:03:56,360
some 3000 yards to their front,

1026
01:03:56,361 --> 01:04:00,890
commanded by Sergeant Ralph Briggs
Junar Afford Edwards, Wisconsin.

1027
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:04,130
These men had been out for several
days to warn of an enemy approach.

1028
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,970
Colonel Polar was on the field phone
during the day of digging in trying to

1029
01:04:07,971 --> 01:04:11,960
persuade his regimental commander to
have headquarters withdraw Briggs and his

1030
01:04:11,961 --> 01:04:15,590
patrol. They're going to
sacrifice those men. That's all.

1031
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:19,010
We don't need any bait on the hook. As you
say, if they're coming, they're coming.

1032
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:23,870
This is foolishness to throw away that
platoon and they do a great job in the

1033
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:24,621
mini series,

1034
01:04:24,621 --> 01:04:28,760
the Pacific of kind of showing this
and if you ever watch the Pacific,

1035
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,780
I mean just watch it, watch it about 10
times. I've probably watched it 20 times

1036
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:40,520
and he tries to keep them as safe as he
can back to the book. All right. He said,

1037
01:04:40,521 --> 01:04:42,320
let's get this straight.
Hold your hold.

1038
01:04:42,321 --> 01:04:46,100
Fire until you get an order from me that
the outpost must get clear before we

1039
01:04:46,101 --> 01:04:48,230
open up.
If the bastards breakthrough,

1040
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:51,080
use the bayonet and keeps
someone at every phone.

1041
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:55,870
Weight Puller looked at his watch.
It was 10 o'clock yells, rolled,

1042
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:59,840
yells, rolled from the right
Japanese voices shouting in English,

1043
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:02,240
blood for the emperor marine,
you die.

1044
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:05,240
A marine bellowed back to hell
with your goddamn emperor.

1045
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,030
Sergeant Manila.

1046
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:13,960
John Basel owns nest of guns is about
the center of c company in the middle of

1047
01:05:13,961 --> 01:05:16,060
the line with a slight
decline in his front.

1048
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:21,220
The enemy toward him so persistently that
he covered the hill with their bodies

1049
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,920
and when the first fury of attack faded,

1050
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:28,900
he sent men to push down the wall of
enemy bodies to clear the fire lane.

1051
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:31,980
Okay?

1052
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:32,281
Of course,

1053
01:05:32,281 --> 01:05:36,060
that's John Basil owned who was awarded
the Medal of honor for those actions

1054
01:05:36,061 --> 01:05:36,894
that night.

1055
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:42,600
Now there's a a artillery commander,

1056
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:47,780
a little bit to the rear named Deval
and polar is asking devolve for massive

1057
01:05:50,261 --> 01:05:54,530
artillery support because they're like
going to be overrun polar called the vol.

1058
01:05:54,531 --> 01:05:57,700
Again, give us all you've got.
We're holding on by our toenails.

1059
01:05:58,030 --> 01:05:59,620
I'll give you all your call for a polar,

1060
01:05:59,621 --> 01:06:02,740
but God knows what will happen
when this ammo we have is gone.

1061
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:07,360
If we don't need it now, we'll never need
it. If they get through here tonight,

1062
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:12,210
there won't be a tomorrow. That's,
that's the situation that they were in.

1063
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:15,780
Reagan fuller called from the
CP from the flank. Colonel,

1064
01:06:15,781 --> 01:06:17,370
I'm just about running out of ammo.

1065
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:20,830
I've used almost three and a half
units of fire. You got bayonets,

1066
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:25,740
haven't you fuller? Sure. Yes
sir. All right. Then hang on.

1067
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:30,810
And the heaviest of the firing.
When polar law had left the CP,

1068
01:06:30,811 --> 01:06:33,330
regimental headquarters
called for him not here, sir.

1069
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:36,420
The wireman said Colonel Polos Upfront,
find him,

1070
01:06:36,421 --> 01:06:39,990
get him on the phone after the crew had
made several calls to the line position,

1071
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:42,330
pull the returned and talked
to the regimental commander.

1072
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:45,750
If you remaining in the pit,
heard Paulo's explosive reply,

1073
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:47,880
what do you mean what's going on?
We're neck,

1074
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:51,390
neck deep in a firefight and I have
no time standing here, both linking.

1075
01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:54,810
If you want to find out what's going on,
come up and see.

1076
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:01,830
You know,
he was that good,

1077
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:07,500
like he was that good that
he was able to do that.

1078
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:08,220
You know,

1079
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:11,280
it's kind of like rebel and I was talking
about Steve jobs a couple podcasts ago

1080
01:07:11,281 --> 01:07:14,010
and I was like, hey look, he
was a, he was not a good leader.

1081
01:07:14,011 --> 01:07:18,390
He was abusive and he was,
but he was so good at these other skills.

1082
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:23,130
Well he pulled her such a great leader
down the chain of command and he's such a

1083
01:07:23,131 --> 01:07:28,131
great tactician and he's so brave and
so do dump dominant on the battlefield.

1084
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:32,740
Then he does this stuff and like
basically gets away with it. Yeah.

1085
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:38,430
Back to the book, there was
one enemy, prison prisoner,

1086
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:42,060
a little solid warrant officer who refused
to talk when he was brought to polar.

1087
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:46,380
The colonel was so stunned
by the insolence of the
prisoner that he slapped him

1088
01:07:46,381 --> 01:07:50,730
with the flat end of an entrenching tool.
Teeth spilled from the jabs mouth,

1089
01:07:50,731 --> 01:07:53,190
but they were false teeth.
He gave no information.

1090
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:57,000
Even then a later prisoner
talk freely with polar

1091
01:07:58,570 --> 01:07:59,470
and polar asked him,

1092
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:03,400
why didn't you change your tactics when
you saw you weren't breaking our line?

1093
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:07,990
Why don't you shift to a weaker
spot that is not the Japanese way.

1094
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:11,620
The plan had been made.
No one would have dared to change it.

1095
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:14,200
It must go as it is written.

1096
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,870
That's why we have decentralized command.

1097
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:22,220
That's the opposite of
decentralized command. That's
called centralized command.

1098
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:25,910
Here's the plan. This is what you will
execute. Don't do anything different.

1099
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:33,680
Back to the book, and this is kind
of after this thing settled down.

1100
01:08:33,681 --> 01:08:35,660
That's why they prisoners.
That's why he's doing interrogation.

1101
01:08:35,661 --> 01:08:37,160
That's why he's asking, why
didn't you bring it? You know,

1102
01:08:37,161 --> 01:08:40,140
why don't you change your tax? When you
broke the line back to the book pullers,

1103
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:44,600
men found 250 Japanese dead
inside their lines during the day.

1104
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:47,870
About 25 of them. Officers want a
major who had committed suicide,

1105
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:52,250
leaving a final entry in his diary
on the loss of his colors and troops.

1106
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:53,730
Yeah,

1107
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:57,420
I do not know what excuse to give.
I apologize for what I have done.

1108
01:08:57,630 --> 01:09:01,260
I'm going to return my borrowed
life today with short interest.

1109
01:09:03,790 --> 01:09:04,780
Yeah,
I fought that.

1110
01:09:04,781 --> 01:09:07,930
That was worth bringing up because you
always hear about the fanaticism of the

1111
01:09:07,931 --> 01:09:10,000
Japanese, but there you go. That's it.

1112
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:15,580
I apologize and I'm going to kill myself
because I didn't succeed in my mission.

1113
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:17,830
Okay.

1114
01:09:17,830 --> 01:09:20,170
Polars casualty for the
battle where 19 dead,

1115
01:09:20,171 --> 01:09:25,171
30 wounded and 12 missing two or three
days later when the stench of bloated

1116
01:09:26,021 --> 01:09:31,021
bodies in his front made his med Rach
polar persuaded division to make count of

1117
01:09:32,651 --> 01:09:35,140
the enemy casualties and bury the corpses.

1118
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:40,800
This burial detail counted 1,462 bodies
and spent two days in the grizzly work,

1119
01:09:42,610 --> 01:09:46,540
bulldozers, grout, Gow, tolls and
covered the enemy dead and great pits.

1120
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:49,420
So that's incredible.

1121
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:52,210
Incredible that kill ratio.

1122
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,473
Hmm.

1123
01:09:56,780 --> 01:10:01,010
The colonel washed in the river with
the troops and Reagan fuller notice that

1124
01:10:01,011 --> 01:10:02,750
even when he washed his uniforms,

1125
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:06,830
he stripped with the enlisted men in the
river or common touch. The men liked.

1126
01:10:06,831 --> 01:10:11,160
Fuller said though a few of the Klaus
where type officers and the rear rank

1127
01:10:11,161 --> 01:10:14,450
snickered behind his back.
The men knew he was real,

1128
01:10:14,690 --> 01:10:17,270
that he never put on an
act and they loved him.

1129
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:22,353
Okay.

1130
01:10:22,570 --> 01:10:25,870
And again, here's the dichotomy of it.
Like we know what a hard ass he is.

1131
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:31,000
Back to the book. Polar Shield is
shielded his men from unnecessary work.

1132
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:35,620
A young officer who insisted that they
police up the battalion area removing jap

1133
01:10:35,621 --> 01:10:40,390
beer cans and the debris of the battle
was stopped by by the colonel. Forget it.

1134
01:10:40,391 --> 01:10:43,660
Old Man. Let the boys get in their
sacks and leave them the hell alone.

1135
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:47,590
They're half dead from fever and fighting
and they'll have to hop to it again

1136
01:10:47,591 --> 01:10:51,810
any day now. So there you go. That's the,

1137
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:54,940
that's like he just nails that perfect.

1138
01:10:59,500 --> 01:10:59,980
Another

1139
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:04,030
situation, polar was 300 to 400
yards behind the point of his column.

1140
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:09,310
The first salvo of Japanese fire burst
just in front of him for the first time

1141
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:14,190
and he's a combat career spanning 23
years. His luck ran out under enemy fire.

1142
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:19,290
He was blown from his feet by a spray
of flying metal shell fragments has torn

1143
01:11:19,291 --> 01:11:22,050
his legs and lower body
and he was bleeding freely.

1144
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:25,200
The field telephone was
carried by a Marine Justin,

1145
01:11:25,201 --> 01:11:29,700
his rear call headquarters old
man Poehler said, I can't sir.

1146
01:11:29,701 --> 01:11:30,570
The wire's been cut.

1147
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:34,620
The kernels struggled unsteadily
to his feet and tried to help the

1148
01:11:34,621 --> 01:11:39,621
communications man repair the wire as
he stood an enemy sniper shot anatomy

1149
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:43,680
sniper shot him twice through the flesh
of his arm with a small caliber bullets.

1150
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:48,840
He sank back to the ground
sergeant Pennington and
come up by now and he helped

1151
01:11:48,841 --> 01:11:52,530
shepherd lift polar into a Poncho and
get them off and get them off the ground

1152
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:56,970
to avoid tetanus infection.
Shepherd bent over polar.

1153
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:01,290
Are you able to stay in command, sir?
Yes, of course I am. I'll be okay.

1154
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,550
I can't leave these men.

1155
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:06,900
May I call for artillery fire if I can
get rid of your phone working? Yes.

1156
01:12:06,901 --> 01:12:11,130
If you know how men shoveled out a
foxhole for polar and lowered him into the

1157
01:12:11,131 --> 01:12:11,964
Poncho.

1158
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:13,980
Okay.

1159
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:17,370
The telephone was placed in the hole with
him and when the line was repaired he

1160
01:12:17,371 --> 01:12:19,890
cradled the phone in one arm
and talked with headquarters.

1161
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:24,540
Pennington listened as he discussed a
mortar barrage across the river the next

1162
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,490
morning and the launching
of a dawn attack.

1163
01:12:28,230 --> 01:12:31,320
These all shot up and blown up and he's
planning an attack for the morning.

1164
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:35,820
Shepherd called in the artillery fire
shall soon burst in the thickets across

1165
01:12:35,821 --> 01:12:38,490
the stream and the enemy was quiet
for the rest of that evening.

1166
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:40,441
Late in the night,

1167
01:12:40,441 --> 01:12:44,160
pull a realized that he could no longer
walk and called division headquarters.

1168
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:48,720
I find myself unable to
proceed by leading my troops.

1169
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:53,580
He said after it'll delay word
came back major Jonsi Webber,

1170
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,400
we'll assume command of your
battalion within a few hours.

1171
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:58,680
He's leaving the perimeter immediately,

1172
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:07,400
so that was, you know, he gets a

1173
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:10,063
pulled out.

1174
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:11,791
Going back to the book,

1175
01:13:11,791 --> 01:13:15,630
Lieutenant Colonel Polar is being
recommended by General Vandegrift for the

1176
01:13:15,631 --> 01:13:19,530
medal of honor for leading his battalion
with seven holes in him continually for

1177
01:13:19,531 --> 01:13:20,520
24 hours.

1178
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:22,250
Okay.

1179
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:24,020
Three got recommended
for the medal of honor.

1180
01:13:24,021 --> 01:13:25,850
This did not develop with
the division commander.

1181
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:30,410
In addition to commending polars battalion
for its perimeter defense and putting

1182
01:13:31,130 --> 01:13:34,010
in for a third navy crosswords
commander also wrote,

1183
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:38,330
I have known Louis polar since 1919
he was one of the best combat patrol

1184
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:41,690
officers I knew just as he is
an outstanding officer today.

1185
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:45,260
He did a wonderful job with his battalion
on Guadalcanal and every phase of the

1186
01:13:45,261 --> 01:13:48,500
operation I have is proud
to have him as a friend,

1187
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:50,480
as I was glad to have him as a marine.

1188
01:13:55,720 --> 01:14:00,010
January 1st, 1943 was warm and
sunny and the loading went smoothly.

1189
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:03,340
The gear was all stowed in the
last of the First Marine Division.

1190
01:14:03,341 --> 01:14:04,840
Troops were going a board.

1191
01:14:05,890 --> 01:14:08,040
It was only then that they're
conditioned became apparent.

1192
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:12,130
Men who had fought for four months in
the Fallis climate and Pacific and had

1193
01:14:12,131 --> 01:14:14,260
been shelled, bombed, or shot by snipers,

1194
01:14:14,261 --> 01:14:18,070
almost constantly between battles
seem to collapse. At the same moment,

1195
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:22,580
scores were unable to climb the nets
into the ships and had to be carried a

1196
01:14:22,581 --> 01:14:23,414
board.

1197
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:29,290
They had shocked expressions with
glazed sunken eyes for weeks.

1198
01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:32,230
Most of them would be patients
with malaria, dysentery,

1199
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:34,840
assorted fevers and fungus infections.

1200
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:40,060
Virtually every man in the division
had malaria. By now, polar said,

1201
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,270
it isn't so much that they're
sick or even worn out.

1202
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,960
It's the reaction from the discovery
that they're finally leaving this damn

1203
01:14:46,961 --> 01:14:49,930
place,
and yet a lot of them grew into men here.

1204
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:51,680
Okay?

1205
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:52,580
The divisions dead.

1206
01:14:52,581 --> 01:14:57,581
We're 1,242 and 2,655 had been wounded.

1207
01:14:58,670 --> 01:15:00,110
Sickness was near total.

1208
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:01,150
Okay?

1209
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:04,180
No one could yet grasped the
importance of the island fighting.

1210
01:15:04,181 --> 01:15:05,500
On the day of loading out,

1211
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:10,090
the longest of the Pacific
island campaigns had been
fought and the pattern of

1212
01:15:10,091 --> 01:15:11,680
future victories had been set.

1213
01:15:11,890 --> 01:15:15,160
The Japanese had paid a higher price
here then they would pay again,

1214
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:18,970
headed thrown all their disposal ships,
planes,

1215
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:20,680
men and machines.

1216
01:15:21,690 --> 01:15:21,990
Okay.

1217
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:26,250
More than 50,000 men had been lost on the
island or on the ships trying to reach

1218
01:15:26,251 --> 01:15:30,480
it. In Japan, it was already
known as the island of

1219
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:31,423
death.

1220
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:34,030
For more than a year,

1221
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:37,570
Radio Tokyo was to call
the First Marine Division,

1222
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,790
the Guadalcanal butchers.

1223
01:15:45,730 --> 01:15:48,760
So
that's Guadalcanal.

1224
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:54,300
He actually heads home and here we go.

1225
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:55,510
Back to the book,

1226
01:15:56,620 --> 01:16:00,900
an aid in the office in
Washington General Thomas Whole,

1227
01:16:00,901 --> 01:16:04,660
Colm jolted in with the news.
The generals given you to the army polar,

1228
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,660
I mean on loan for three or four months.

1229
01:16:07,661 --> 01:16:11,470
General Marshall wants you to explain the
Guadalcanal fighting to his troops all

1230
01:16:11,471 --> 01:16:14,590
over the country.
You need an Fred about leaving your men.

1231
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:17,650
The division will be in Australia for the
next six months before he can get back

1232
01:16:17,651 --> 01:16:22,270
into action. I expect you'll rejoin
it in time for another big show.

1233
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:28,050
So there's time between these big island
campaigns and he goes home to America

1234
01:16:28,151 --> 01:16:33,151
to take over or spread the word about
what the fighting was like back to the

1235
01:16:33,761 --> 01:16:35,500
book.
He often spoke three times daily.

1236
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:38,410
He was on and off planes until he
all but lost track of his route.

1237
01:16:38,650 --> 01:16:42,100
He told the story of his fight for the
perimeter of Basil own pushing the wall

1238
01:16:42,101 --> 01:16:46,210
of enemy bodies down the hill of
burials by bold bows are in of weapons.

1239
01:16:46,211 --> 01:16:50,560
They used, he told of patrols and
thick growth, but never of his wounds.

1240
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:53,230
Okay.

1241
01:16:53,230 --> 01:16:57,070
I can't tell you the Japs are no damn
good. He said because they are good,

1242
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:58,660
but we're better.

1243
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:03,160
One American properly trained can
handle two of the yellow bastards.

1244
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:07,600
They have discipline and they use
the jungle cover better than we do,

1245
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:12,070
but they can't think on their own.
I'll say that again.

1246
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:17,110
They have discipline and they use the
jungle cover better wound then we do,

1247
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,970
but they can't think on their own.

1248
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:23,080
That's a critical dichotomy
that the discipline,

1249
01:17:23,081 --> 01:17:25,930
which obviously obviously
is something that I am

1250
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:27,070
okay

1251
01:17:27,070 --> 01:17:28,540
passionate about.
Sure.

1252
01:17:28,990 --> 01:17:32,260
But if you put so much discipline
in too much discipline in place,

1253
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:34,860
people don't think for themselves
anymore. Yeah. They just wait. Yeah.

1254
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:41,490
They never change battle plans. Once
they're made, regardless of cost,

1255
01:17:41,910 --> 01:17:43,230
they think they'd lose face.

1256
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:47,040
They have no artillery to compare with
ours and our guns chew them to pieces.

1257
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:50,040
They get the jungle rot
just as much as we do.

1258
01:17:50,370 --> 01:17:53,910
They're not supermen and we'll with the
hell out of them and you'll be helping

1259
01:17:53,911 --> 01:17:57,630
to do it soon, I suppose. If you
take your training seriously,

1260
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,920
then there's nothing to worry about,

1261
01:17:59,430 --> 01:18:04,430
but you'll have to be hard and you can
be hard when you write with your families

1262
01:18:05,010 --> 01:18:09,860
to try to convince them that were in
a war to the finish and then all these

1263
01:18:09,861 --> 01:18:13,380
strikes and softness and confusion,
we'll have to go.

1264
01:18:14,410 --> 01:18:14,640
Okay.

1265
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:15,930
I can tell you one more thing.

1266
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,210
There are worse things than
dying for your country.

1267
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:22,130
Yeah.

1268
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:25,010
When he spoke to the war production
board officials in Washington,

1269
01:18:25,011 --> 01:18:25,611
here's what he said.

1270
01:18:25,611 --> 01:18:27,980
I want to ask you why American
troops shouldn't have the best,

1271
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:31,970
the world's best fighting equipment on
Guadalcanal. We saw our trenching shovels.

1272
01:18:31,971 --> 01:18:33,740
Break it first.
Use all over.

1273
01:18:33,770 --> 01:18:37,130
Men now have jap shovels because
they're better and more dependable.

1274
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:41,450
JAP field glasses are better too.
I have good ones myself,

1275
01:18:41,451 --> 01:18:43,460
German glasses that I've
carried for 20 years.

1276
01:18:43,610 --> 01:18:47,240
Why should American glasses be so poor,
not worth a damn and the tropics,

1277
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:51,050
they fog up and they are improperly
sealed. Once they get damped,

1278
01:18:51,051 --> 01:18:51,860
they're done for,

1279
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:56,690
I've seen hundreds of pairs tossed away
in the jungle or c because men know they

1280
01:18:56,691 --> 01:18:58,190
can see as well with the naked eye.

1281
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:02,060
What kind of American ingenuity
or patriotism produced those

1282
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:05,413
he doesn't play.

1283
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:10,260
This is the little part about humility.

1284
01:19:10,261 --> 01:19:13,230
We'll have to get over the idea that we're
the greatest people on earth in every

1285
01:19:13,231 --> 01:19:17,190
respect, that we're infallible and that
no one else has ideas worth considering.

1286
01:19:18,030 --> 01:19:21,660
One of the reasons we had to fight against
the odds on Gratta Canal Guadalcanal

1287
01:19:21,810 --> 01:19:26,810
was this insufferable American notion
of superiority and our carelessness and

1288
01:19:27,121 --> 01:19:31,080
the face of danger. It goes back to
Pearl Harbor and far beyond. He's saying,

1289
01:19:31,081 --> 01:19:33,720
you've got to stay humble.
You can't be arrogant.

1290
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:36,653
Yeah.

1291
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:41,330
He was summoned before the high command
of the Marine Corps and gave some gay

1292
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:44,180
and gave the same forthright
picture of the fighting he had seen.

1293
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:48,740
Gentlemen,
we have some of the same old troubles,

1294
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:51,830
staff officers who've
never seen combat issue,

1295
01:19:51,831 --> 01:19:56,090
unrealistic orders that cost
lives, time, money and ruin morale.

1296
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:57,531
For example,

1297
01:19:57,531 --> 01:20:00,980
we were out there on that island try and
trying to defend a perimeter when they

1298
01:20:00,981 --> 01:20:04,610
waited, when they wanted to send
a patrol outside the command.

1299
01:20:04,611 --> 01:20:08,760
Never used a single regimen but
sent out three mixed battalions.

1300
01:20:09,330 --> 01:20:12,630
The logical thing would have been a
regular regimen with one battalion leading

1301
01:20:12,631 --> 01:20:16,620
the other and the other two
covering officers and men
will be familiar with each

1302
01:20:16,621 --> 01:20:19,950
other and there would never be
questioned about who is in command,

1303
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:24,810
but when we did go out, it was
almost always with mixed battalions.

1304
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:28,890
It may look good in the staff
officers chart here at headquarters,

1305
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:30,060
but it didn't work.

1306
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:34,740
Brought us only stumbling and confusing
and casualties more than once.

1307
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:38,040
When we were out in the jungle,
nobody really knew who was in command.

1308
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:42,090
I could cite you the names of many
of man I lost because of that.

1309
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:47,160
It was inexcusable.
This is something that it absolutely is,

1310
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:50,340
is very important to understand,
especially for guys that aren't,

1311
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,940
well I guess anybody, you, you work
in your train in a certain way,

1312
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:59,970
as much as you can stay in the groups
that you work in, train with. Right.

1313
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:04,740
And for them to just randomly,
and who knows why they did this.

1314
01:21:04,741 --> 01:21:05,970
But I'll tell you what I've seen.

1315
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:11,010
I've seen this where let's
say there's some operation,

1316
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:15,720
uh, that's a high visibility
operation that everyone thinks, wow,

1317
01:21:15,721 --> 01:21:19,800
that'd be a cool operation to
do. Well, instead of just taking,

1318
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:23,730
let's say one company, they go, okay,

1319
01:21:23,731 --> 01:21:27,810
well we want to get multiple different
people to get to be able to be involved

1320
01:21:27,811 --> 01:21:28,644
in this operation.

1321
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:31,020
So we'll take one platoon for this
company and one platoon from this other

1322
01:21:31,021 --> 01:21:33,630
company at one platoon for this other
company and we'll just send them all out

1323
01:21:33,631 --> 01:21:38,580
there. That's exactly what he's
talking about. It's like, no, no. Hey,

1324
01:21:38,581 --> 01:21:40,950
sorry, you guys aren't going
to go on this operation.

1325
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:43,730
We're sending Alpha Company or
Bravo company or whatever. Right.

1326
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:47,580
That's the way you do
it. Yeah. Play around.

1327
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,960
Here's a little comment because
I love the machine guns.

1328
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,320
Little comment on the
art of machine gunnery.

1329
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:03,820
These guns are the most
important firepower to infantry.

1330
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,090
Just,
I'm just making that statement.

1331
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:11,050
Tested Code Chesty Puller statement g

1332
01:22:13,150 --> 01:22:15,400
machine guns.
Go be a machine gunner.

1333
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:19,660
You know what I'm saying?
I ain't know what to say.

1334
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:23,210
I was so fired up one day we're at the
gym and I walked in, there was some,

1335
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:27,350
some kid was signing up and he was not,
I call him a kid.

1336
01:22:27,351 --> 01:22:32,040
He was probably old man. 24 years old.
Yeah. And so I said, hey, old man. No.

1337
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:35,080
And you know, I think,
uh, I said, you know,

1338
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,730
I could tell you had like a
high and tight. I was like, oh,

1339
01:22:38,270 --> 01:22:41,030
are you in the military? He goes, yeah,
I'm in the Marine Corps. I said, well,

1340
01:22:41,031 --> 01:22:45,400
what are you doing? The Marine Corps?
He said, machine gunner dig it. S

1341
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:50,240
awesome.
All right.

1342
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:58,640
Here's another, another
comment. We just don't know.

1343
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:03,380
All we ought to know about warfare
on land or sea. Just off Guadalcanal.

1344
01:23:03,381 --> 01:23:05,180
Not long ago,
we lost three cruises.

1345
01:23:05,410 --> 01:23:09,550
Cruisers blasted down by Jap guns as
they sat there sitting ducks. That's all.

1346
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:11,320
I'll tell you exactly why we lost him.

1347
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:14,770
The admiral in charge got a plain report
that the JAP force was approaching at

1348
01:23:14,771 --> 01:23:16,150
14 knots by daylight,

1349
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:20,440
so we figured at this speed the enemy
couldn't arrive in his waters before the

1350
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:22,120
next dawn. After dark. Of course,

1351
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:25,750
the jab stepped up their speed
to 28 knots and got there,

1352
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:29,260
got to the scene at 3:00 AM when our
men were not even at battle stations.

1353
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:33,100
Instead of keeping it happened like that,

1354
01:23:33,101 --> 01:23:36,310
I'm positive and instead of
keeping such thing secret,

1355
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:40,690
we ought to have them emblazoned
on the gate at every naval station.

1356
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:45,930
We must not be too proud or too stupid
to profit by our mistakes and God knows

1357
01:23:48,701 --> 01:23:52,630
that we make them. Have you ever heard
the term profit from our mistakes before?

1358
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:55,990
No, but I really like it. Yeah,
I think I really like it too.

1359
01:23:56,710 --> 01:24:01,510
Why not profit from your
mistakes? It's brilliant. Yeah.

1360
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:03,690
Yeah. It kind of puts it
more into prison, you know,

1361
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:07,210
they say learn from your mistakes. Right?
Yeah. Cool. But when you say products,

1362
01:24:07,730 --> 01:24:09,060
so much more valuable.

1363
01:24:09,890 --> 01:24:12,360
Yeah. Talks a little bit about, uh,

1364
01:24:14,910 --> 01:24:17,520
well,
the psychological impact of combat.

1365
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:21,270
I know something about the strain of
combat. For five years in Nicaragua,

1366
01:24:21,271 --> 01:24:25,350
I marched at least 20 days a month
under constant threat of enemy ambushed,

1367
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:27,360
but it never saw those.

1368
01:24:27,780 --> 01:24:31,740
But I never saw on those Indian troops
any sign of battle fatigue or anything

1369
01:24:31,741 --> 01:24:35,220
resembling it in the Pacific.
I saw a lot of our people break down.

1370
01:24:35,430 --> 01:24:36,690
My reaction is this,

1371
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:39,960
what does it matter how you're
killed if you're killed in battle,

1372
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:44,160
why does the louder noise in a fight with
heavy artillery and bombs makes such a

1373
01:24:44,161 --> 01:24:44,820
difference?

1374
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:48,000
I think the difference is entirely in
the mind and the preparation of men for

1375
01:24:48,001 --> 01:24:52,860
combat in Haiti actions. When I fought,

1376
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,630
the men were all picked volunteers.

1377
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:58,710
Professionals who are paid to fight and
realize they might die in the trade.

1378
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:04,620
I'm sure from my own experience that it's
the mental attitude I went through the

1379
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:08,130
worst days they had on Guadalcanal and I
didn't suffer a bit. I lost some weight.

1380
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:10,650
But that was because we
didn't get the proper food.

1381
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:16,580
If we make our men tof in the mind before
they go to war and give them an honest

1382
01:25:16,621 --> 01:25:20,850
idea of what war is like,
we won't have so much of this trouble.

1383
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:26,790
Why do we have to baby them with all this
crap about careers and opportunity and

1384
01:25:26,791 --> 01:25:30,540
foreign travel. Ah, yeah.

1385
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:32,333
You know what I mean?

1386
01:25:33,230 --> 01:25:37,360
You know what I mean? Yeah. That
makes a lot of sense there. You know,

1387
01:25:38,330 --> 01:25:43,130
they say, I forget where I read
this, but people who come back from,

1388
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:47,600
from war, they, they kind of
differentiated like were people who were,

1389
01:25:47,601 --> 01:25:50,830
who were in it like,
you know how like JP and you and,

1390
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:55,160
and I just always wanted to do this to
be a combat leader, to be a navy seal,

1391
01:25:55,161 --> 01:25:58,430
to be a commando. You know, like typically
people with that kind of attitude,

1392
01:25:58,431 --> 01:26:01,600
they don't get affected by it because
it's kind of like the thing where it

1393
01:26:01,610 --> 01:26:04,100
affected less. Yeah. Generally you are

1394
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:05,960
correct generally guys that

1395
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:11,090
like special operations guys that
that's what they wanted to do. Yeah.

1396
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:14,900
There's a whole bunch of other things
that play into that as well. The training,

1397
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,690
because he's talking about hard training.
Well guess what? In special operations,

1398
01:26:17,691 --> 01:26:22,430
you do get harder training, you
have a tighter, uh, or you have,

1399
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:26,090
you have a real close relationship with
all your guys and you stay together with

1400
01:26:26,091 --> 01:26:29,720
your guys. That is helpful too. I mean,

1401
01:26:29,930 --> 01:26:33,070
it's not any type of relationship
that you have and an infantry platoon,

1402
01:26:33,090 --> 01:26:33,471
trust me,

1403
01:26:33,471 --> 01:26:38,000
I've seen those in Marine Corps and army
of trend and military units get tight.

1404
01:26:38,150 --> 01:26:41,360
It doesn't matter whether you're special
operations or not. Uh, but the training,

1405
01:26:41,450 --> 01:26:45,470
they step up the training, they make
it really hard. That plays a role.

1406
01:26:45,471 --> 01:26:48,800
But I think you're right is that guys
that think that that's what they want to

1407
01:26:48,801 --> 01:26:53,060
do, then that helps as well. So
there's a bunch of little factors,

1408
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:58,430
but I think what his point is like
there's two, there's two points.

1409
01:26:58,490 --> 01:27:01,550
Number one, make the training hardest. I
guess there's three points. Number one,

1410
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:03,440
make the training hard as hell.
Number two,

1411
01:27:03,530 --> 01:27:08,530
make sure people know what to expect
and don't talk to them about like the

1412
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:10,040
career opportunities.

1413
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:13,520
I just answered this question on the way
of the warrior kid podcast, right? Well,

1414
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:16,280
I answered the question. The question
was, is it fun to be a navy seal?

1415
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:21,530
And I answered the question,
Hey, is it fun? Yes,

1416
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:23,900
absolutely. It's fun. That's part of it.

1417
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:29,050
But the other part of it is you are
going to go to war and you could die and

1418
01:27:29,541 --> 01:27:32,300
that's a harsh thing to tell a
nine year old or a 10 year old,

1419
01:27:32,570 --> 01:27:35,120
but that's exactly what you should
tell a nine year old and a 10 year old

1420
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:38,900
because that's what you're signing up for.
I was,

1421
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:43,720
I was doing another interview recently
and I told this story and I've,

1422
01:27:43,721 --> 01:27:44,870
I've told it before,
but you know,

1423
01:27:44,871 --> 01:27:49,871
it was like the first time some woman
that I had been working with a company and

1424
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:55,040
some woman that was her
husband or something. Anyways,

1425
01:27:55,610 --> 01:27:59,210
the woman said, you know, can you meet my
son? He really wants to be a navy seal,

1426
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:03,860
you know, and I was, you know, I said,
Oh yeah, sure. You know, who the kid was,

1427
01:28:03,930 --> 01:28:05,920
whatever, 17 or 18 years
old. He was a junior,

1428
01:28:05,930 --> 01:28:10,640
senior in high school and he was
this, you know, strapping kid who is,

1429
01:28:10,730 --> 01:28:15,290
you know, look like a great athlete. And
she wanted to bring me to lunch with him.

1430
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:19,610
So we went to lunch and, and it was,
you know, the details of the story.

1431
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:24,500
I don't recall exactly, but it was
basically, uh, you know, my son,

1432
01:28:24,501 --> 01:28:25,980
he wants to be a navy seal.
He,

1433
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:29,330
he's on the swim team and he's on the
track team and he played football and he

1434
01:28:29,331 --> 01:28:32,870
just loves working out and he just, I
think he'd be great. And then he just,

1435
01:28:32,930 --> 01:28:37,130
he can do 28 pull ups and the kid's like,
yeah, I love working out and across.

1436
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:42,040
I surf too. And I love the ocean. I love
the water. And it was like cool. And,

1437
01:28:42,041 --> 01:28:45,050
and you know, for awhile, you know,
I was listening and then, you know,

1438
01:28:45,051 --> 01:28:47,930
of course I was like, yeah, you
know, that's, that sounds like,

1439
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:52,460
it sounds like you'd be well prepared
for the physical aspects of it,

1440
01:28:52,850 --> 01:28:55,790
but what you have to remember is
that the reason you become a seal,

1441
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:58,540
so you can go and fight in wars and you're
going to kill people and you're gonna

1442
01:28:58,541 --> 01:29:01,010
be at the risk of dying and you're
going to be at the risk of being,

1443
01:29:01,410 --> 01:29:04,140
and that's what's going
to happen to your friends,

1444
01:29:04,650 --> 01:29:08,010
if not you and the,

1445
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:12,030
when I got done saying like
on that sentence, the mom's
face completely changed.

1446
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:16,800
Yeah. Because it's what he's talking
about right here, which is, hey, you know,

1447
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:21,150
it's travel and adventure and career
opportunities. Like know what it is, is,

1448
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:25,080
is war and savagery and the worst

1449
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:29,190
things that you could possibly experience
is what you're gonna experience.

1450
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:32,280
That's what you need to
tell people. Yeah. Yeah.

1451
01:29:32,330 --> 01:29:36,330
The special operations and the conclusion
for what what I was reading there was

1452
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:41,160
people when they go in knowing
and kind of how they put it,

1453
01:29:41,161 --> 01:29:43,820
like forward leaning into,
uh,

1454
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:46,580
the realities of a military situation.
Yeah.

1455
01:29:46,660 --> 01:29:50,610
It tends to be special operations or
guys who want to do it for that reason.

1456
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:53,610
Not The guy who got sold on world travel.

1457
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:57,750
[inaudible] guy's definitely going
to have a rougher time with it.

1458
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:02,000
And you've got to remember too,
there's hundreds of,

1459
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:05,940
there's a massive percentage
of army, infantry, marine
corps, infantry. Guess what?

1460
01:30:05,941 --> 01:30:08,190
They want to be marine corps,
infantry. They want to be,

1461
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:09,600
that's what they want to do.

1462
01:30:09,630 --> 01:30:14,100
That they're just as passionate about that
as some guy that like, cause that job,

1463
01:30:14,130 --> 01:30:18,390
it's a little bit different, but a lot
of that parts of that job are, you know,

1464
01:30:18,391 --> 01:30:22,650
when we had Brian Stann on, we talked
about this, you know, like Brian Stan was,

1465
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:27,000
you get to be in charge of more
people. You get, it's, it's a,

1466
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:28,380
it's a different dynamic.

1467
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:33,150
But the combat leadership opportunities
in and just the combat opportunities.

1468
01:30:33,151 --> 01:30:36,600
I mean, when we were in Ramadi, yeah.
Like I had the infantry in Ramadi,

1469
01:30:36,810 --> 01:30:39,330
those guys were freaking getting after it.
They were just,

1470
01:30:39,331 --> 01:30:44,310
it was insane to watch those
guys. So, yeah, I, you know,

1471
01:30:45,270 --> 01:30:46,230
there's plenty,
I mean,

1472
01:30:46,231 --> 01:30:49,350
there's the vast majority or
there's plenty of guys in the,

1473
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:52,470
in the regular conventional
forces, they don't, they,

1474
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:56,550
they do just as good after combat as the,
as the special operations guys do.

1475
01:30:56,990 --> 01:30:59,610
So it's more, and you know, we
talked about this Peter a Tia,

1476
01:30:59,890 --> 01:31:01,960
it was like if a guy's fractured going in,

1477
01:31:01,961 --> 01:31:05,580
it doesn't matter if it's
special operations or
conventional forces or general

1478
01:31:05,581 --> 01:31:09,690
purpose units, he's, if he's fractured
going in, the war's gonna mess him up.

1479
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:13,350
If he's solid going in, he's
going to do well. Right.

1480
01:31:13,410 --> 01:31:15,000
So that's the determining factor.

1481
01:31:15,210 --> 01:31:19,590
The training definitely helps the telling
people the truth up front definitely

1482
01:31:19,591 --> 01:31:23,980
helps, but you don't know what
you're going to get. Yeah.

1483
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:27,420
And there's also plenty of guys as
special operations that do have serious

1484
01:31:27,421 --> 01:31:31,660
issues. Yeah. Yeah. And the article
wasn't about like special operations,

1485
01:31:31,661 --> 01:31:33,870
so that's not what it was about.
It was more about the state of mind.

1486
01:31:33,871 --> 01:31:37,910
I think special where I know that special
operations was just like an example of

1487
01:31:37,911 --> 01:31:40,860
some of some point that they're
making. Well we talked, again,

1488
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:44,370
I'm referencing all these different
podcasts, but when Jordan Peterson was on,

1489
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:47,060
we talked about like the
offensive mindset, right?

1490
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:51,300
And the morning offensive you can be
generally the more psychologically

1491
01:31:51,301 --> 01:31:52,630
comforting that is,
it's,

1492
01:31:52,631 --> 01:31:55,290
it's psychologically uncomfortable
to be on the defensive.

1493
01:31:55,980 --> 01:32:00,070
It's psychologically more comfortable
to be on the offensive right there.

1494
01:32:00,071 --> 01:32:01,900
I just get the right,
yes. Cycle. Okay. Yeah.

1495
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:04,930
Psychologically uncomfortable
to be on the defensive.

1496
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:06,580
Psychologically more comfortable.

1497
01:32:06,581 --> 01:32:10,360
It's not necessarily comfortable cause
you still have bad things that can happen

1498
01:32:10,361 --> 01:32:13,540
when you're on offense,
but it's definitely
psychologically more comfortable.

1499
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:15,340
So those things play a role.

1500
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:20,260
You happen like to your experience
or are you considered an experience?

1501
01:32:20,261 --> 01:32:23,740
It's like I'm going to happen to this
experience rather than this is going to be

1502
01:32:23,741 --> 01:32:27,100
offensive instead of
defensive. Absolutely. Kind
of like when people say, hey,

1503
01:32:27,101 --> 01:32:31,450
how life's, how's life treating you
versus how are you treating life?

1504
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:35,710
You know that old saying. Yeah. You
see what I'm saying? I'll go with it.

1505
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:40,810
Just go with it. Let's go ahead. Here's,
here's another thing that he did.

1506
01:32:40,811 --> 01:32:44,110
He calls out and this is very interesting
and everyone that's in the military

1507
01:32:44,111 --> 01:32:45,790
will hear this and kind
of shake their head.

1508
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:52,300
The practice of having command
post exercises. Polar said though,

1509
01:32:52,301 --> 01:32:55,510
he realized that he was treading
on prominent toes in his audience.

1510
01:32:55,840 --> 01:33:00,430
We take skeleton forces of headquarters
troops and the like just a handful and

1511
01:33:00,431 --> 01:33:03,190
go through exercises so
often that we forget.

1512
01:33:03,191 --> 01:33:06,430
We aren't simulating that we
aren't simulating actual warfare.

1513
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:11,350
It has become so bad that even platoons
are carrying out command post exercises

1514
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:15,880
in battle. Of course, once you set
up a CP, which is a command post,

1515
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:17,340
you stop for all.

1516
01:33:17,470 --> 01:33:21,520
You stop all forward motion because
the commanders sit on their duffs in

1517
01:33:21,521 --> 01:33:24,970
relative security and when
you hope forward motion,

1518
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:29,380
you get in trouble immediately. I
have to admit, we have to learn.

1519
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:32,470
I admit we have to learn
how to handle commands,

1520
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:34,900
but we've carried it to
a ridiculous extreme.

1521
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:40,140
They do a lot of that command exercises.
W the,

1522
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:44,170
the most unrealistic thing about it is
like he's saying that you'll have not a

1523
01:33:44,171 --> 01:33:49,171
real platoon but like a
small representation of a
platoon so the commander can

1524
01:33:49,841 --> 01:33:52,330
move that platoon around real easily.
Cause it's this little thing.

1525
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:57,340
But then when you have a real platoon
that takes real vehicles in real,

1526
01:33:57,610 --> 01:33:57,791
you know,

1527
01:33:57,791 --> 01:34:01,390
it's like moving pieces on a board as
opposed to like when you move this,

1528
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:06,070
this battalion from here to there, it
all you do is just move this move there,

1529
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,250
move there, piece on a board.
That was real easy. Yeah.

1530
01:34:09,490 --> 01:34:12,730
You look at what actually happens in
the field when you move that piece of

1531
01:34:12,731 --> 01:34:15,640
looking battalion and it's massive.
It's Ha,

1532
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:19,570
it's this incredible
project to make it happen.

1533
01:34:20,370 --> 01:34:23,110
Yeah. To move a battalion, you know,

1534
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:26,680
four miles or two miles or whatever.
It's like,

1535
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:27,910
well this is what it's going to take.

1536
01:34:27,911 --> 01:34:31,990
Fuel and food and ammunition and
wounded and planning all this stuff.

1537
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:34,850
But the person up top just cause oh yeah,
we'll just make that Italian leather.

1538
01:34:35,590 --> 01:34:39,520
One morning as he approached the company
of his men, lounging among their tents,

1539
01:34:40,010 --> 01:34:43,720
a newly arrived lieutenant barked an
order and the marine scrambled to their

1540
01:34:43,721 --> 01:34:46,960
feet standing at attention. What the
Hell's wrong with you? Pull a roared.

1541
01:34:47,290 --> 01:34:50,500
Don't you think I've got more sense
than demand that you put on a show?

1542
01:34:50,501 --> 01:34:54,310
Every time I come within pistol range,
get back down on your ducts.

1543
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:59,180
You ought to know me well enough
that I'm no bandbox soldier.

1544
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:02,900
Take it easy. There's enough for you to
do when we get to our next assignment.

1545
01:35:02,990 --> 01:35:06,440
Again, dichotomy is that okay? You
don't need to snap to attention.

1546
01:35:06,441 --> 01:35:07,340
Every time I come around,

1547
01:35:09,020 --> 01:35:14,020
there's an army quartermaster and the
general showed up and they had asked for a

1548
01:35:16,101 --> 01:35:18,830
bunch of shotgun shells.
Here we go. Back to the book.

1549
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:22,310
He's asked for 10,000
brass buck shot shells.

1550
01:35:22,311 --> 01:35:26,570
What the devil it is you want with
those to kill jabs with sir. It doesn't.

1551
01:35:26,571 --> 01:35:29,690
Colonel Polar know that buck shot is
prohibited by the Geneva Convention.

1552
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:34,160
Sir Colonel Polar doesn't give a damn
about the Geneva convention any more than

1553
01:35:34,161 --> 01:35:35,660
the Japs did at Pearl Harbor.

1554
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:42,413
Okay?

1555
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:47,120
Now as they're getting
ready to go and assault, um,

1556
01:35:48,290 --> 01:35:49,123
Gloucester,

1557
01:35:50,450 --> 01:35:53,990
the enemy had word of
the coming assault radio,

1558
01:35:53,991 --> 01:35:56,480
Tokyo blared one afternoon
in late December,

1559
01:35:56,481 --> 01:36:01,481
the first American Marine Division
assorted cutthroats degenerates and jail

1560
01:36:01,761 --> 01:36:04,550
birds has been chased out of Melbourne,

1561
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:07,970
is now in camp in New Guinea and
we'll try to invade Cape Gloucester.

1562
01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:12,330
I'm pleased to add that our soldiers
are fully prepared to repulse the,

1563
01:36:12,331 --> 01:36:13,730
since little attempt the jungles,

1564
01:36:13,731 --> 01:36:18,530
we'll run red with the blood of the
Guadalcanal butchers. So that's, that's,

1565
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:22,940
that's the propaganda cut throats
degenerates in jail birds.

1566
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:26,240
So now they're going to Gloucester,
Cape Gloucester.

1567
01:36:27,230 --> 01:36:30,350
On the early morning of December 26th,
they stood off Cape Gloucester.

1568
01:36:30,351 --> 01:36:34,010
Big Guns on the fleet rolled for
a half for an hour and a half,

1569
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:37,490
beginning before dawn or the marines
and their traditional d day, Bruh eight,

1570
01:36:37,491 --> 01:36:41,810
their traditional DDA breakfast of
steak and eggs while solve those,

1571
01:36:41,870 --> 01:36:43,520
shook the halls beneath them.

1572
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:48,050
Third Battalion Seventh Marines landed
first quickly followed by polars old

1573
01:36:48,051 --> 01:36:48,471
battalion,

1574
01:36:48,471 --> 01:36:52,940
which floundered through a morass behind
of the beach and pushed up the tall

1575
01:36:52,941 --> 01:36:57,050
knoll already known to aviators
and ship gunners as target hill.

1576
01:36:57,680 --> 01:36:59,200
An hour after the seventh was a shore,

1577
01:36:59,220 --> 01:37:02,990
the first marines came turn toward the
airfield and walked into a well laid

1578
01:37:02,991 --> 01:37:04,610
Japanese Sam Bush tanks.

1579
01:37:04,611 --> 01:37:08,270
Big tanks came into clear
the enemy from there,

1580
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:12,140
hidden bunkers and by nightfall the first
was well on its way to the airfield,

1581
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:14,720
a falling tree in a soggy forest,

1582
01:37:14,721 --> 01:37:19,721
injured one marine and otherwise there
were only 20 killed and 22 wounded on d

1583
01:37:20,031 --> 01:37:21,230
day.
Enemies.

1584
01:37:21,350 --> 01:37:26,210
Casualties were estimated
at 50 on December 30th the
first and fifth secured the

1585
01:37:26,211 --> 01:37:31,070
field after hand to hand fighting in
which they had to call on tanks for help.

1586
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:32,520
Okay.

1587
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:35,490
Once sergeant remembered a moment
from a mortar attack by the enemy,

1588
01:37:36,030 --> 01:37:38,880
a kid sitting there and his foxhole,
he didn't have any head,

1589
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:42,540
he just had a neck with dog tags on it.
A great face.

1590
01:37:42,541 --> 01:37:45,930
Youngster nearby was muttering as he fled,
as he fired his rifle,

1591
01:37:46,050 --> 01:37:49,260
it don't do any good. I got three
of them, but it don't do any good.

1592
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:54,300
Japanese snipers had infiltrated the line
and killed marines at short range and

1593
01:37:54,301 --> 01:37:57,090
one unit tried wade.
The stream was broken.

1594
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:03,540
It's survivors driven to hide in the
weeds on the edge from midstream.

1595
01:38:03,650 --> 01:38:05,250
A boy who failed to make it over,

1596
01:38:05,251 --> 01:38:10,251
hung over a log his body riddled by a
score of bullets for and a half an hour or

1597
01:38:10,351 --> 01:38:14,790
more. He called to his mates before
he died, I'm here. Here I am.

1598
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:20,820
The attack had stalled the line and now
become u shaped with a pocket of the

1599
01:38:20,821 --> 01:38:24,650
enemy holding back the
center General Rupert,

1600
01:38:24,651 --> 01:38:29,200
us from division relieved the commander
of the third battalion, seventh marines,

1601
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:34,320
and sent polar into action once more with
orders to reorganize and drive forward

1602
01:38:34,481 --> 01:38:35,314
the unit.

1603
01:38:37,850 --> 01:38:38,683
So

1604
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:46,430
they weren't making any progress and
the commander said, you know what,

1605
01:38:46,431 --> 01:38:50,240
I'm putting polar beckon action.
Send the wolf.

1606
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:55,280
The trouble was the same and here's,
here's puller.

1607
01:38:55,340 --> 01:38:59,060
Talking to his guys as he showed up,
the pillow was the same old thing.

1608
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:00,710
The trouble was the same old thing.

1609
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:04,460
Staff officers don't know the meaning
of terrain and how it can slowed down

1610
01:39:04,610 --> 01:39:08,300
troops and costs lives. I went up to
the front about two in the afternoon.

1611
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:11,930
I called the company commanders and told
them as briefly as I could what I had

1612
01:39:11,931 --> 01:39:15,590
in mind. I've been sent to take over.
Your commander has been relieved.

1613
01:39:15,740 --> 01:39:17,720
I don't intend to believe,
be relieved.

1614
01:39:17,721 --> 01:39:20,600
You can bet on that we're going
to attack here in the morning.

1615
01:39:21,470 --> 01:39:24,740
There were protests that the jap bunkers
could not be seen and that they were

1616
01:39:24,741 --> 01:39:27,710
cutting up our line.
I told them I had the medicine for that.

1617
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:31,820
I ordered up some of Joe Buckley's half
tracks because I knew their guns could

1618
01:39:31,821 --> 01:39:35,120
deal with the bunkers.
The resistance was fairly light,

1619
01:39:35,121 --> 01:39:39,440
but the staff orders were so foolish
that we were just sitting targets that

1620
01:39:39,441 --> 01:39:41,090
we're making sitting
targets of our people.

1621
01:39:41,210 --> 01:39:43,340
Buckley did a great job
there as he always did.

1622
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:47,780
They had orders in these battalions to
guide both right and left and order.

1623
01:39:47,781 --> 01:39:50,810
That can't be followed well,
even on a per ne parade ground.

1624
01:39:51,350 --> 01:39:54,830
Any beginner knows that you can
guide left or you can guide,

1625
01:39:54,831 --> 01:39:58,610
right or even center, but you can't
follow two leaders on either side.

1626
01:39:58,611 --> 01:40:01,640
At the same time.
The line will buckle and cause gaps.

1627
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:05,300
We were frustrating the troops
with delays to reform the line.

1628
01:40:06,260 --> 01:40:10,550
I just said, now we will go forward and
forget about all this guiding business.

1629
01:40:10,730 --> 01:40:12,530
Just forget there's anybody on the flanks.

1630
01:40:12,650 --> 01:40:15,230
We have enough power here to
drive and we're going to drive,

1631
01:40:15,350 --> 01:40:18,110
blow your way through.
Think of nothing else.

1632
01:40:19,850 --> 01:40:20,680
Okay,

1633
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:23,500
so important part there.
Once again,

1634
01:40:23,530 --> 01:40:25,720
you can't follow multiple
leaders at the same time.

1635
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:30,820
And he's talking about a physical example
like guiding in the military is when

1636
01:40:30,821 --> 01:40:33,590
you're marching, you look to
your left and you, you, you fall,

1637
01:40:33,610 --> 01:40:37,540
you line up with the person to your left.
And usually these people were saying,

1638
01:40:37,541 --> 01:40:39,940
no lineup with a person to your
left and the person to your right.

1639
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:45,130
How the hell are you going to do
that? You'd not, that's the answer.

1640
01:40:47,430 --> 01:40:51,820
Before the gun stopped. A staff
officer from division, uh,

1641
01:40:52,290 --> 01:40:53,190
and and

1642
01:40:55,110 --> 01:40:55,943
okay.

1643
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,720
A staff officer from division went
up on the line and here he says,

1644
01:40:59,721 --> 01:41:02,600
I went up there and the heaviest of the
action when fire was flying all around

1645
01:41:02,601 --> 01:41:07,520
us, polar walked around outside the wire
and hills six 60 and stopped at every,

1646
01:41:07,521 --> 01:41:11,540
dug out to talk to some kid. He'd say,
how's things going in their old man,

1647
01:41:11,930 --> 01:41:15,290
just as if he'd come from next
door to borrow a cup of sugar.

1648
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:18,680
Those kids thought it was the
greatest thing that ever happened.

1649
01:41:18,830 --> 01:41:21,620
You'd think you'd been
handing out thousand dollar
bills down the line and there

1650
01:41:21,621 --> 01:41:22,880
was some place to spend them.

1651
01:41:24,230 --> 01:41:28,790
Polaroid found one d moralized boy sitting
stone lean his whole looking out with

1652
01:41:28,791 --> 01:41:32,720
a telltale thousand yard stare. He
murdered over and over. Colonel,

1653
01:41:32,721 --> 01:41:36,530
we gotta get the Hell Outta here.
That's no way to talk. Old Man.

1654
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:40,880
Polar led the boy a few paces to the rear
and sat with him for 10 minutes or so.

1655
01:41:41,030 --> 01:41:44,930
Look old, man. I want to go home too.
I'm not getting any younger. Hell,

1656
01:41:44,931 --> 01:41:48,620
I'm 45 years old.
You know that I've got a family at home.

1657
01:41:48,830 --> 01:41:50,270
I know this dump is no good,

1658
01:41:50,390 --> 01:41:54,860
but neither of us is going home until we
lick these bastards. We've got to make,

1659
01:41:55,340 --> 01:41:58,550
we've got to help make our
folks at home safe too.

1660
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:03,230
I'll try and get you some hot
chow up here. Old Man. So again,

1661
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:06,200
you just got a guy that's totally gets it.

1662
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:13,233
Yeah,

1663
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:19,160
lots of heavy fighting a, they get
Gloucester secured. In February,

1664
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:23,330
1944 polar had a physical examination
and the Cape and the camp at Cape

1665
01:42:23,330 --> 01:42:27,410
Gloucester and aside from a notation of
a recent attack of malaria was found in

1666
01:42:27,411 --> 01:42:28,370
perfect condition.

1667
01:42:28,670 --> 01:42:32,390
On the same day upon hearing rumor that
one third of the veterans of Guadalcanal

1668
01:42:32,391 --> 01:42:34,010
was to be rotated back to the states.

1669
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:38,750
Paul wrote general whole comb the
commandant in terms which would have been

1670
01:42:38,751 --> 01:42:40,970
appreciated by a Caesar or Napoleon.

1671
01:42:42,220 --> 01:42:47,090
It is respectfully requested that my
present assignment to a combat unit be

1672
01:42:47,091 --> 01:42:50,780
extended until the downfall
of the Japanese empire

1673
01:42:53,870 --> 01:42:55,010
freaking get some.

1674
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:56,793
Okay.

1675
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:00,270
The division recouped
and drew replacements.

1676
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:04,220
The first of the new weapons began to
appear in quantities. The Springfields.

1677
01:43:04,221 --> 01:43:06,720
It almost disappeared
now to pull her sorrow.

1678
01:43:07,170 --> 01:43:10,020
He was interested in the first
of a new style flame thrower.

1679
01:43:10,021 --> 01:43:12,360
When an officer brought
one by the youngster,

1680
01:43:12,361 --> 01:43:17,040
proudly explained the work of the deadly
torch and look to polar for approval.

1681
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:19,890
Where's the bayonet fit on it?

1682
01:43:21,780 --> 01:43:25,980
It's another like famous quote from
Chesty Puller. Here's a flame thrower,

1683
01:43:26,010 --> 01:43:29,430
but you need to put a bayonet
fitting on it. Just in case

1684
01:43:31,180 --> 01:43:34,120
he's counseling is officers about

1685
01:43:35,770 --> 01:43:40,770
about showing being brave and
stepping up and at the same time,

1686
01:43:42,430 --> 01:43:45,040
here's the, here's the dichotomy. He says,

1687
01:43:45,041 --> 01:43:47,590
I don't want you to go up
under the guns just for show.

1688
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:50,950
It's only the idiots in green kids
who think they're bulletproof,

1689
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:52,430
but if you don't show some courage,

1690
01:43:52,431 --> 01:43:57,200
your officers won't show it either and
the kids will hang back. It's that.

1691
01:43:57,590 --> 01:44:01,100
It's that kind of an outfit
that always has trouble.

1692
01:44:02,970 --> 01:44:07,350
Next we go pull a return to Porvoo
to find a new stern. The camps,

1693
01:44:07,830 --> 01:44:10,170
the allied landings in France,
we're expanding.

1694
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:15,210
The new [inaudible] had begun to bomb
Tokyo [inaudible] panted fallen whole

1695
01:44:15,211 --> 01:44:19,050
fleets of cargo ships had brought the
first division new equipment to pursue,

1696
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:22,650
and there was word of an independent
role for the marines in a new operation.

1697
01:44:22,860 --> 01:44:26,970
General Macarthur would follow his
own southern course on island hopping,

1698
01:44:27,180 --> 01:44:29,760
but the core would stab
into central Pacific.

1699
01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:32,850
Polar could hardly conceive the
scope of the new Marine Corps,

1700
01:44:33,210 --> 01:44:38,160
which he had known to as a force of Amir.
19,000 is prewar days.

1701
01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:42,450
There are now five divisions in and
to brigade in the Pacific and another

1702
01:44:42,451 --> 01:44:46,200
division in training in California.
Well over 100,000 men.

1703
01:44:47,010 --> 01:44:47,330
Okay.

1704
01:44:47,330 --> 01:44:49,880
In late July,
on that same day,

1705
01:44:49,881 --> 01:44:54,560
Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman were
nominated for the coming elections back

1706
01:44:54,561 --> 01:44:56,570
home.
Marines landed on Guam.

1707
01:44:57,070 --> 01:44:57,290
Okay.

1708
01:44:57,290 --> 01:45:00,710
A few days after Lewis got the news,

1709
01:45:01,670 --> 01:45:04,250
Lieutenant Colonel Sam
Polar had been killed.

1710
01:45:04,790 --> 01:45:06,920
Shot through the heart by
a machine gunners. Bullet.

1711
01:45:07,950 --> 01:45:08,390
Yeah.

1712
01:45:08,390 --> 01:45:12,530
Is intimates. Notice a new reserve
in the kernel and these days,

1713
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:16,160
but it was not long before still another
false report which added to the growing

1714
01:45:16,161 --> 01:45:21,161
puller legend Marines whispered that
when he got word of Sam's death,

1715
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:27,180
he had said grimly, those who live
by the sword must die by the sword.

1716
01:45:28,130 --> 01:45:28,720
Okay.

1717
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:31,720
The loss of Sam had in
fact touched Lewis' deeply.

1718
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:36,210
He covered it with silence and to hurry
turning to other topics when officers

1719
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:37,960
spoke of his brother's death.

1720
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:39,280
Okay.

1721
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:40,113
On [inaudible],

1722
01:45:40,610 --> 01:45:45,610
the division intensified it's work and
sweat it at war games on the beaches and

1723
01:45:45,771 --> 01:45:50,450
in the palm groves there was a new
watchword Pellalou the next target.

1724
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:59,150
So Yup.
His brother,

1725
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:02,810
Lieutenant Colonel Sam Polar was
killed and he got word of that.

1726
01:46:05,030 --> 01:46:05,863
Yeah,

1727
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:10,040
hundred only a hundred thousand marines.
That might seem like a lot, but that's,

1728
01:46:10,250 --> 01:46:14,790
that's not a lot when you consider what
the tasks that they had before them.

1729
01:46:16,190 --> 01:46:17,023
Okay,

1730
01:46:20,680 --> 01:46:24,940
so now they're heading, they're
heading to Pella Lu. The next target,

1731
01:46:25,990 --> 01:46:30,990
when the big fleet left for the plows to
follow the bombardment ships there was

1732
01:46:31,171 --> 01:46:33,720
bought a single somber note aboard.

1733
01:46:33,730 --> 01:46:38,730
One of the vessels were stacks of many
hundreds of white wooden crosses far more

1734
01:46:39,011 --> 01:46:40,390
than a two days' supply.

1735
01:46:44,020 --> 01:46:44,970
Two days from Pellalou.

1736
01:46:44,980 --> 01:46:48,970
There was a report from the underwater
demolition teams who's met at boldly

1737
01:46:48,990 --> 01:46:52,980
swimming to shore and inspected
jap defenses. Nothing serious.

1738
01:46:52,981 --> 01:46:56,010
They said the way would be cleared.

1739
01:46:56,580 --> 01:46:58,080
Polars mind was not relieved.

1740
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:01,410
He had never before felt pessimism
at the opening of a battle.

1741
01:47:08,750 --> 01:47:12,920
Now we're starting the invasion.
There was no moon.

1742
01:47:12,950 --> 01:47:15,620
The Sky was filled with stars and
there was not a trace of cloud.

1743
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:20,780
Toward The dawn of September 15th the
transports had come into position on the

1744
01:47:20,781 --> 01:47:24,590
horizon, the guns, it's the
guns of the fleet. Spurted fire.

1745
01:47:24,710 --> 01:47:26,690
For hours the funder was unbroken,

1746
01:47:26,870 --> 01:47:29,890
but as gray edge sky as grads,

1747
01:47:29,900 --> 01:47:33,230
the sky pace slowed and
the fire became to sultry.

1748
01:47:34,340 --> 01:47:35,600
The island was invisible.

1749
01:47:36,050 --> 01:47:40,010
Occasional flares erupted above it in
the darkness and drifted from site.

1750
01:47:40,190 --> 01:47:43,610
The troops had breakfast before daylight,
steak and eggs again,

1751
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:46,760
and when the first of
them came to the decks,

1752
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:51,350
the chain of the Palau's lay in a
black silhouette across the sea.

1753
01:47:52,250 --> 01:47:55,830
There was a moderate swell,
a breeze spraying up coming
from the island of Pella,

1754
01:47:55,831 --> 01:47:56,664
Lou.

1755
01:47:57,610 --> 01:47:58,280
Okay.

1756
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:02,440
The guns broken to a full cry once more
and the final shelling struck target.

1757
01:48:02,650 --> 01:48:05,230
The two assault battalions of the
first marines went aboard board.

1758
01:48:05,231 --> 01:48:06,970
The big landing vehicles on the decks.

1759
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:10,630
The malls of the ship's clanked open
in the amphibious tractors were spewed

1760
01:48:10,631 --> 01:48:14,310
forth milling as they formed lines
ready to move forward toward the breach.

1761
01:48:14,510 --> 01:48:16,900
The beach,
they were 4,000 yards out.

1762
01:48:17,290 --> 01:48:21,610
Vast flights of planes came over
wheeling in from all directions.

1763
01:48:21,730 --> 01:48:22,421
They dived,

1764
01:48:22,421 --> 01:48:26,950
bombed and climbed over pell Lou for an
hour or more and soon after the first of

1765
01:48:26,951 --> 01:48:31,180
the bombs fell, a slow hesitant
curtain gathered over the land.

1766
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:34,630
It seemed impossible that anything
living could have endured,

1767
01:48:34,870 --> 01:48:39,160
but Alaska is the assault began a puff
of anti aircraft smoke flowered in the

1768
01:48:39,161 --> 01:48:44,161
sky and a plane dropped in flames just
before eight 30 the first wave started

1769
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:49,210
short polar watch for the signal flag to
dip from the yard arm of a control boat

1770
01:48:49,240 --> 01:48:50,073
in his front.

1771
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:55,320
The amtraks foamed away on the broad
wakes at almost eight 30 precisely the

1772
01:48:56,981 --> 01:49:00,250
vehicle ground on the sand.
Polar never forgot the scene.

1773
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:05,140
I went up over the side as fast as I
could scramble and ran my cal at least 25

1774
01:49:05,141 --> 01:49:09,580
yards before I hit the beach flat down.
When I looked back to the Amtrak,

1775
01:49:09,790 --> 01:49:13,390
I saw four or five shells hit it
all at once. A few men were killed,

1776
01:49:13,391 --> 01:49:14,560
getting out too slow,

1777
01:49:14,650 --> 01:49:17,500
but most of them were saved because
they got out before we stopped moving.

1778
01:49:18,070 --> 01:49:19,810
We lost our communications officer.

1779
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:22,030
His leg was blown off
and he couldn't be saved.

1780
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:25,410
I look down the beach and saw a mess.
Every damn damn tracking.

1781
01:49:25,420 --> 01:49:28,780
Our wave had been destroyed in the
water by the enemy or shot to pieces.

1782
01:49:28,781 --> 01:49:33,220
The minute it landed, I tried to
get aligned, set up for defense.

1783
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:34,690
The wireman were there fast.

1784
01:49:34,691 --> 01:49:37,300
As soon as I was doing their
job without further orders,

1785
01:49:37,540 --> 01:49:39,520
and we lost several of
them in the hot fire,

1786
01:49:40,770 --> 01:49:44,280
every platoon leader was trying to
form a line of his own. Just as I was,

1787
01:49:44,730 --> 01:49:46,480
runners were going up
and down the beaches.

1788
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:51,500
We tried to get organized that big PR
promitory on my left hadn't been touched

1789
01:49:51,611 --> 01:49:56,230
by all the ship's guns and planes and we
got a whirlwind of machine gun and anti

1790
01:49:56,231 --> 01:49:58,560
tank fire pullers.

1791
01:49:58,561 --> 01:50:02,650
Second Battalion drove through a heavy
growth of woods now torn by the shelling

1792
01:50:02,860 --> 01:50:07,860
and by nine 30 had driven 350 yards
ahead to the edge of the airfield.

1793
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:12,610
They tied on the line of the
fifth marines. Casualties
were reported as heavy,

1794
01:50:12,611 --> 01:50:14,770
but the trial of the
second had only begun.

1795
01:50:15,310 --> 01:50:19,120
The new position was faced by an obstacle
marked on none of the invasion maps,

1796
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:24,360
a sheer coral ridge who
sides were honeycombed with
Japanese positions from Fox

1797
01:50:24,991 --> 01:50:28,930
holes to gigantic dug outs of
reinforced steel and concrete.

1798
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:33,820
Some of them with four levels, each of
which could be closed off with steel doors

1799
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:36,230
for eight hours.

1800
01:50:36,231 --> 01:50:40,400
The regimen endured the most
savage fighting of the Pacific war.

1801
01:50:46,570 --> 01:50:49,870
General Smith had come
across assured 11:30 AM

1802
01:50:52,860 --> 01:50:54,210
when the phone line was spicy,

1803
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:58,410
spliced late in the afternoon and he
talked with polar. He had only one.

1804
01:50:59,190 --> 01:51:03,720
He had only a calm report
were dug in solid and we've
got the old one phase line.

1805
01:51:03,721 --> 01:51:04,554
All right.

1806
01:51:04,830 --> 01:51:09,300
Polar night made no mention of especially
heavy casualties or have need for help.

1807
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:13,020
It was estimated that the first marines
had lost 500 men during the day.

1808
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:17,750
The first water that had come
ashore, oil drums, and was foul.

1809
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:23,030
Polar shouted his rage to the officers
on the ships bellowing for new supplies.

1810
01:51:25,610 --> 01:51:26,280
Okay,

1811
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:26,700
here's,

1812
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:31,480
here's polars report enemy
well dug in opposition,

1813
01:51:31,481 --> 01:51:36,100
strong little damage done by our
preliminary fire. Hard fight ahead,

1814
01:51:36,460 --> 01:51:41,460
casualties over 20% I've ordered no man
to be evacuated and less from bullet or

1815
01:51:42,251 --> 01:51:45,340
shell wounds.
Request further supply.

1816
01:51:45,550 --> 01:51:50,020
Fresh water are still on drinkable men.
Retching

1817
01:51:58,700 --> 01:52:02,810
polar called division and talked with
Colonel Seldon, the chief of staff.

1818
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:06,200
He remembered the year, the
conversation years later, Johnny,

1819
01:52:06,201 --> 01:52:09,170
half my regimen has gone.
I've got to have replacements.

1820
01:52:09,171 --> 01:52:11,750
If I'm to carry out division
orders tomorrow morning,

1821
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:14,600
you know we have no replacements.
Louie,

1822
01:52:14,900 --> 01:52:17,910
I told you before we came ashore that
we should have at least one regiment

1823
01:52:17,950 --> 01:52:21,860
reserve. We're not fighting a third.
We're not fighting a third of the men.

1824
01:52:21,861 --> 01:52:24,440
We brought in all these damn
specialists you brought.

1825
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:25,990
Okay.

1826
01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:29,800
Anything wrong with your orders,
Louie? No, I'm ready to go ahead,

1827
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:33,160
but you know my casualties or
50% what do you want me to do?

1828
01:52:33,460 --> 01:52:37,240
Get me some of those 17,000 men
on the beach. You can't have them.

1829
01:52:37,241 --> 01:52:39,040
They're not trained in for infantry.

1830
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:42,460
Give them to me and by nightfall
tomorrow they'll be trained.

1831
01:52:42,461 --> 01:52:47,461
Infantry polar went out with a runner
through the night to find posts of his

1832
01:52:47,481 --> 01:52:49,430
battalion commanders
and pass on the order.

1833
01:52:49,580 --> 01:52:53,900
We press a top attack at eight o'clock
in the morning. No change. Full speed.

1834
01:52:54,020 --> 01:52:55,130
Use every man.

1835
01:52:57,790 --> 01:52:58,540
Okay.

1836
01:52:58,540 --> 01:52:59,111
He fought,

1837
01:52:59,111 --> 01:53:03,340
fell more than once and cut himself on
the coral shepherd and others had left

1838
01:53:03,580 --> 01:53:04,840
and others left at headquarters.

1839
01:53:04,841 --> 01:53:09,400
Notice that the colonel was beginning to
limp and that his left leg had swollen.

1840
01:53:09,850 --> 01:53:14,230
Seldon called back. Pulled in.
You got my orders. Okay. Yes,

1841
01:53:14,290 --> 01:53:17,560
you need and explain further.
I just came back from my battalions.

1842
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:20,440
We're going to take of ground
tomorrow without replacements.

1843
01:53:20,590 --> 01:53:22,720
We're willing to try,
but don't forget,

1844
01:53:22,721 --> 01:53:26,770
we're just going to add 10
or 15% to our casualties.

1845
01:53:29,580 --> 01:53:30,270
Yeah.

1846
01:53:30,270 --> 01:53:35,190
When the sun rose on September 18th 200
of the 473 men in polars third battalion

1847
01:53:35,450 --> 01:53:36,870
were headquarters personnel.

1848
01:53:36,990 --> 01:53:41,510
Many frontline units had been
decimated long before noon.

1849
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:45,350
There were cases of heat prostration.
The blazing sun was hotter than ever.

1850
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:50,240
Faces and lips were clack cracked and
bleeding. Salt pills became scarce again.

1851
01:53:50,810 --> 01:53:54,380
Polar was optimistic for they
started the attack from high ground,

1852
01:53:54,650 --> 01:53:56,510
but the crucial days still lay ahead.

1853
01:53:57,550 --> 01:53:57,980
Okay.

1854
01:53:57,980 --> 01:54:02,980
Hank Adams came bipolars command post
and found him half clad and filthy sweat

1855
01:54:03,381 --> 01:54:06,470
soaked trousers with a
heavy beard on his face.

1856
01:54:07,780 --> 01:54:08,380
Okay,

1857
01:54:08,380 --> 01:54:10,180
I'm coming back this afternoon.
Colonel,

1858
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:13,420
do you want me to bring you a
a fresh uniform? Hell, Hank,

1859
01:54:13,421 --> 01:54:17,200
I've got no time for that. Every man in
the outfit will get clean before I do.

1860
01:54:18,340 --> 01:54:18,730
Okay.

1861
01:54:18,730 --> 01:54:20,780
Re tenant,
Colonel Lou Walt.

1862
01:54:21,110 --> 01:54:24,920
Now the executive officer of the fifth
marines saw polar a command conference

1863
01:54:24,921 --> 01:54:25,790
during the day.

1864
01:54:26,740 --> 01:54:27,050
Okay.

1865
01:54:27,050 --> 01:54:30,170
He was absolutely sick
over the loss of his bed.

1866
01:54:39,730 --> 01:54:42,070
Vietnam,
he fought hand to hand until day light,

1867
01:54:42,100 --> 01:54:44,560
beating off charges that
no survivor could count.

1868
01:54:45,510 --> 01:54:46,180
Yeah.

1869
01:54:46,180 --> 01:54:48,040
As firstlight spilled over the ridge,

1870
01:54:48,190 --> 01:54:51,790
the shrunken company beat back the
last Japanese attack with stones,

1871
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,910
ammunition boxes, bare
fists, and bayonets.

1872
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:56,810
Okay.

1873
01:54:56,810 --> 01:55:01,810
Several of the enemy were flung bodily
off the cliff and fell shrieking in onto

1874
01:55:02,001 --> 01:55:03,740
the splintered coral below,

1875
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:13,313
but they did it

1876
01:55:15,050 --> 01:55:15,861
at the end of the day.

1877
01:55:15,861 --> 01:55:20,861
The regiment reported a total
of 1,878 men lost since d day.

1878
01:55:22,290 --> 01:55:26,190
The fighting went on without a break until
September 23rd when the first marines

1879
01:55:26,191 --> 01:55:28,470
rested in lines without advancing.

1880
01:55:29,780 --> 01:55:34,430
They beat off several counterattacks
and patrols pushed out a thousand yards

1881
01:55:34,431 --> 01:55:36,830
down the west coast
without serious opposition.

1882
01:55:38,010 --> 01:55:40,500
The regimen was relieved
at 2:00 PM of this day.

1883
01:55:40,830 --> 01:55:45,570
By the 321st of the 81st army division,

1884
01:55:45,780 --> 01:55:49,140
the new commander took one look
at the forward command post.

1885
01:55:49,141 --> 01:55:53,910
Polar had occupied and ordered it moved
more than a thousand yards to the rear.

1886
01:55:56,270 --> 01:55:57,103
Yeah.

1887
01:55:57,190 --> 01:56:01,360
The nine days on the line polars regimen
had eliminated one major block house

1888
01:56:01,690 --> 01:56:06,690
and 144 defended caves and lesser
pillboxes division reported that 3,942

1889
01:56:08,411 --> 01:56:13,270
Japanese had been killed in the regimens
zone. No enemy had been captured.

1890
01:56:13,900 --> 01:56:18,900
Polars total casualty of men were 56%
the highest regimental losses in the

1891
01:56:20,111 --> 01:56:21,190
history of the core.

1892
01:56:22,410 --> 01:56:23,090
Yeah.

1893
01:56:23,090 --> 01:56:28,090
First Battalion had lost 71% the second
56% the third 55% headquarters and

1894
01:56:31,551 --> 01:56:34,100
weapons companies,
32%

1895
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:35,870
okay.

1896
01:56:35,870 --> 01:56:39,440
General Smith who walked the terrain
after it was finally captured,

1897
01:56:39,650 --> 01:56:42,650
said it seemed impossible that men
could have moved forward against the

1898
01:56:42,651 --> 01:56:47,270
intricate and mutually supporting
defenses the Japanese had been had set up.

1899
01:56:48,470 --> 01:56:52,700
It can only be explained as a reflection
of the determination and aggressive

1900
01:56:52,701 --> 01:56:54,320
leadership of colonel polar.

1901
01:57:02,230 --> 01:57:03,063
Yeah.

1902
01:57:05,150 --> 01:57:05,983
Now,

1903
01:57:06,430 --> 01:57:06,810
okay,

1904
01:57:06,810 --> 01:57:11,190
polar. That's the last major combat
for polar, was it Pella? Lou,

1905
01:57:12,540 --> 01:57:17,430
he ends up going back to the states for
a bit and while he's back on the states

1906
01:57:17,431 --> 01:57:18,480
back in the states.

1907
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:19,473
Okay.

1908
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:26,300
America drops the atomic bombs
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
and the war is over and

1909
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:30,570
shortly thereafter

1910
01:57:32,350 --> 01:57:36,140
they order general puller.

1911
01:57:36,670 --> 01:57:36,930
Okay.

1912
01:57:36,930 --> 01:57:40,460
Two or colonel polar at this time too.

1913
01:57:40,980 --> 01:57:43,050
The reserves now.

1914
01:57:44,550 --> 01:57:45,383
Okay.

1915
01:57:45,750 --> 01:57:49,050
Like I said, he, he, he, he
didn't get along with some people,

1916
01:57:49,051 --> 01:57:52,800
especially up the chain of command and
he didn't want to be sent to the reserves

1917
01:57:52,801 --> 01:57:53,634
because that's,

1918
01:57:55,830 --> 01:57:59,280
that's not what a career marine
wants to do. So here we go.

1919
01:57:59,281 --> 01:58:03,180
Back to the book curdle you've been
ordered to reserve duty in New Orleans.

1920
01:58:03,181 --> 01:58:06,180
It's a big district, you know,
and very important to the core.

1921
01:58:08,700 --> 01:58:09,300
Yeah.

1922
01:58:09,300 --> 01:58:10,710
Polar was not misled.

1923
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:15,840
He realized what it meant to be shown
to reserve duty into a side pocket.

1924
01:58:16,110 --> 01:58:18,540
Many marine career had ended that way.

1925
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:24,600
One of the inevitable problems with the
marine corps, and this is polar talking,

1926
01:58:25,230 --> 01:58:29,160
one of the inevitable problems with
the marine corps or any other military

1927
01:58:29,161 --> 01:58:34,161
service is that staff officers take
over the minute a war ended combat.

1928
01:58:34,641 --> 01:58:38,300
People run things when the chips are
down and the country's life is at stake.

1929
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:42,100
But when the gun stop,
nobody's got used for combat man.

1930
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:43,730
Okay.

1931
01:58:43,730 --> 01:58:47,480
The staff officers are like rats.
They stream out of hiding and takeover.

1932
01:58:47,650 --> 01:58:51,230
It's true. Just watch what happens
to paperwork, God and peace time.

1933
01:58:51,231 --> 01:58:55,520
They'll put out enough to sink a small
size nation into the sea and when the war

1934
01:58:55,521 --> 01:58:59,630
breaks out, most of it just naturally
stops. That's the way they do everything.

1935
01:58:59,900 --> 01:59:02,290
There must be a staff
of people of course are,

1936
01:59:02,291 --> 01:59:05,840
we'd never get everything done but if
we don't stop this empire building of

1937
01:59:05,841 --> 01:59:09,230
staff, somebody's going to come
along and lick us one of these days.

1938
01:59:10,010 --> 01:59:12,860
We'll be so nodded and red
tape that we can't move.

1939
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:24,190
Well we, you ever seen that

1940
01:59:26,050 --> 01:59:27,280
seal team thing?

1941
01:59:28,340 --> 01:59:32,080
Um, I'll put it on a tee shirt or
something but it's a Freddy the frog,

1942
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:34,210
the little symbol of the frog man,

1943
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:39,360
the Freddy the frog and he's like in a
glass jar or a glass casing and it says

1944
01:59:40,601 --> 01:59:44,670
in case of war break glass cause like
you don't want the guy around when peace

1945
01:59:44,671 --> 01:59:47,890
time is going on. Right, right,
right. That's what, that's what chest,

1946
01:59:47,891 --> 01:59:49,390
that's another chesty puller.
Right.

1947
01:59:49,990 --> 01:59:54,610
They want them during peacetime
cause he's causes. He speaks up

1948
01:59:57,010 --> 02:00:00,130
well.
Piece didn't last that long.

1949
02:00:00,131 --> 02:00:02,050
On June 25th,

1950
02:00:02,050 --> 02:00:05,590
1950 North Korean troops poured across
the 38th parallel and strength and

1951
02:00:05,591 --> 02:00:09,190
warhead returned.
Polar recognized all the signs.

1952
02:00:09,370 --> 02:00:13,030
He immediately asked for a modification
of his orders and said urgently to

1953
02:00:13,031 --> 02:00:13,571
headquarters.

1954
02:00:13,571 --> 02:00:16,570
Attention is invited to the fact that
I served as an officer in Haiti and

1955
02:00:16,571 --> 02:00:20,860
Nicaragua and in the Pacific Theater
for eight years prior to the Japanese

1956
02:00:20,861 --> 02:00:22,000
attack on Pearl Harbor.

1957
02:00:22,210 --> 02:00:27,040
This experience will prove a value in
an assignment to combat duty in Korea

1958
02:00:29,690 --> 02:00:30,523
and

1959
02:00:32,340 --> 02:00:36,090
well the senior personnel know that.
Then he gets what he asked for.

1960
02:00:36,091 --> 02:00:40,380
Polar arrived in southern California
in the heat of late July and found San

1961
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:43,260
Diego and area of bedlam,
marine reservists thronged in it,

1962
02:00:43,490 --> 02:00:46,860
ev in from every corner of the nation's
thousands of vehicles towards since

1963
02:00:46,861 --> 02:00:50,070
World War Two were being overhauled
and driven to port trains,

1964
02:00:50,071 --> 02:00:51,510
bar regulars from the east coast.

1965
02:00:51,511 --> 02:00:55,920
Unattached officers came from everywhere
without a call. Volunteers for war.

1966
02:00:56,670 --> 02:01:00,300
The First Marine Division was
being created almost from scratch,

1967
02:01:02,180 --> 02:01:04,220
so they had,
they had

1968
02:01:04,700 --> 02:01:07,880
dismantled so much of the service after
World War II and now they've got to

1969
02:01:07,881 --> 02:01:11,690
rebuild it all very quick. They
do. They talk about it in the book.

1970
02:01:11,691 --> 02:01:16,160
I skip over that, but we know what
that consists of. Hardcore training,

1971
02:01:16,161 --> 02:01:18,710
getting people ready for war.
Finally they get,

1972
02:01:18,770 --> 02:01:22,610
he gets to Japan and they're
waiting now to go and Korea

1973
02:01:23,700 --> 02:01:25,240
into Korea.
Polar hail,

1974
02:01:25,241 --> 02:01:28,110
the passing medical corpsman and
went to a nearby army hospital.

1975
02:01:28,111 --> 02:01:29,700
I want to talk with
some of the casualties.

1976
02:01:29,701 --> 02:01:31,380
I've got to find out
what's happening in Korea.

1977
02:01:32,430 --> 02:01:36,150
He went up in an elevator with an army
doctor who seemed on point on the point

1978
02:01:36,151 --> 02:01:36,984
of tears,

1979
02:01:36,990 --> 02:01:40,850
go into the wards and see those kids and
you'll soon know more about more than

1980
02:01:40,851 --> 02:01:41,900
you want about Korea.

1981
02:01:42,890 --> 02:01:47,000
Take a look at all the self inflicted
wounds we've got and those kids are so

1982
02:01:47,001 --> 02:01:51,110
green, they don't even realize how
obvious it is. Just from the powder burns.

1983
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:55,910
Polar walked down many rows
of beds talking with the men.

1984
02:01:56,060 --> 02:01:59,540
Many of them frightened and broken
and heard their tales of Korea.

1985
02:02:00,540 --> 02:02:05,280
Polar was sobered but not despair.
He told some young,

1986
02:02:05,370 --> 02:02:08,970
younger officers that night,
there's nothing wrong with American kids.

1987
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:11,370
Their leadership has
just all gone to hell.

1988
02:02:12,780 --> 02:02:15,690
There's a whole hospital full of babies.
You might say,

1989
02:02:16,350 --> 02:02:16,750
okay.

1990
02:02:16,750 --> 02:02:18,640
They were never given a
chance to grow into men.

1991
02:02:18,850 --> 02:02:21,070
It won't be that way with our marines,
I'll tell you that

1992
02:02:27,870 --> 02:02:32,870
it or preparing for d day in Incheon does
the one biggest amphibious operations

1993
02:02:33,770 --> 02:02:38,770
and they're getting ready for that and
he has a little chat with his officers.

1994
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:41,330
We're the most fortunate of men.

1995
02:02:42,140 --> 02:02:45,980
Most Times professional soldiers have
to wait 25 years or more for a war,

1996
02:02:46,160 --> 02:02:48,920
but here we are with only five years.
Wait for this one.

1997
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:53,420
During that time we've sat on
our fat Duff's drawing our pay.

1998
02:02:53,570 --> 02:02:56,750
Now we're getting a chance to earn it
to show the taxpayers were worth it.

1999
02:02:57,230 --> 02:03:00,080
We're going to work at our
trade for a little while.

2000
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:04,880
We live by the sword and if necessary,
we'll be ready to die by the sword.

2001
02:03:05,060 --> 02:03:07,250
Good luck.
I'll see you a shore

2002
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:14,810
and listen up old man. When you have
something to say to your officers are men,

2003
02:03:15,050 --> 02:03:19,070
make it snappy. The fewer words,
the better. They won't believe it.

2004
02:03:19,071 --> 02:03:20,150
If you shoot bull

2005
02:03:22,390 --> 02:03:26,650
when you face ranks of men and try
that, you can hear him sighing, despair.

2006
02:03:26,651 --> 02:03:29,470
When you open your mouth,
if they sense you're a phony,

2007
02:03:30,300 --> 02:03:30,710
okay?

2008
02:03:30,710 --> 02:03:33,830
They can usually look at you and tell.
Maybe it doesn't sound like it,

2009
02:03:33,980 --> 02:03:36,860
but it's an important thing.
You know, marines career.

2010
02:03:40,680 --> 02:03:44,430
Don't try and don't try and what
does he call it? Shoot Ball.

2011
02:03:44,610 --> 02:03:47,880
Don't try and shoot ball.
Tell the boys what's going on for real.

2012
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:49,080
They see right through you

2013
02:03:51,570 --> 02:03:54,540
wrote his wife a letter before he leaves.
Sweet.

2014
02:03:55,920 --> 02:04:00,780
I will be unable to write you again
for a few days, but you, Virginia,

2015
02:04:00,930 --> 02:04:04,440
Virginia, Mac, Martha, Lee,
and Louis, those are his kids.

2016
02:04:05,470 --> 02:04:06,070
Okay?

2017
02:04:06,070 --> 02:04:07,720
We'll be constantly in my thoughts.

2018
02:04:08,580 --> 02:04:08,860
Yeah.

2019
02:04:08,860 --> 02:04:11,950
May God bless you always
and provide for you,

2020
02:04:12,340 --> 02:04:15,490
giving you much happiness
and useful lives.

2021
02:04:16,950 --> 02:04:21,120
You my children must take advantage of
all opportunities and develop into good

2022
02:04:21,121 --> 02:04:25,440
Christians. Much love to all
of you. I love you, Virginia.

2023
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:27,060
I always have.

2024
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:28,630
Okay.

2025
02:04:28,630 --> 02:04:29,470
And I always will.

2026
02:04:34,050 --> 02:04:34,883
Yeah.

2027
02:04:36,100 --> 02:04:36,970
Here we go into in.

2028
02:04:39,580 --> 02:04:39,880
Okay.

2029
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:43,360
By five 30 in the afternoon when the first
waves, the marines reached the shore,

2030
02:04:43,690 --> 02:04:47,590
the men of the fleet could no longer see
in John hundreds of boats milled in the

2031
02:04:47,591 --> 02:04:52,420
outer harbor in their turn crossing the
embarkation line and moving toward land

2032
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:55,390
where they disappeared into
a bank of smoke and dust.

2033
02:04:55,600 --> 02:05:00,070
Polar went into his objective at blue
beach with the third wave in a twilight

2034
02:05:00,150 --> 02:05:01,900
Hasson hastened by smoke,

2035
02:05:01,901 --> 02:05:06,610
Paul and climbed a 15 foot seawall and
one of the scaling ladders improvised on

2036
02:05:06,611 --> 02:05:07,540
a ship in route.

2037
02:05:13,940 --> 02:05:14,773
They

2038
02:05:15,100 --> 02:05:20,050
meet some fairly light resistance.
Here's what polar says,

2039
02:05:20,051 --> 02:05:22,810
it won't amount to much. Tonight.
We took them by surprise.

2040
02:05:23,890 --> 02:05:27,760
Polars casualties had been light and the
divisions total for the day was only 20

2041
02:05:27,761 --> 02:05:32,761
killed in 170 wounded puller was
awake at 3:30 AM calling the battalion

2042
02:05:33,641 --> 02:05:35,830
commander and making plans
for an attack at dawn

2043
02:05:37,530 --> 02:05:42,180
polar swift drive. Hurry to hurry to
joining forces in an effort to keep pace.

2044
02:05:42,420 --> 02:05:45,650
Captain Ray styles of
ridges battalion saw that.

2045
02:05:46,370 --> 02:05:46,750
Okay.

2046
02:05:46,750 --> 02:05:50,890
The secret was not only
in polars incisive orders,

2047
02:05:51,010 --> 02:05:52,840
he gave us pride in some way.

2048
02:05:52,841 --> 02:05:56,920
I can't describe all those of us had
heard hundreds of stories about him and

2049
02:05:56,921 --> 02:06:00,040
today that we couldn't actually
see him doing great things.

2050
02:06:00,070 --> 02:06:03,430
He kept building up our morale higher
and higher just by being there.

2051
02:06:04,430 --> 02:06:04,920
Yeah.

2052
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:07,650
When we were moving up to companies
from the adjoining battalions,

2053
02:06:07,651 --> 02:06:11,150
marched abreast and got a little mixed.
One of the kid yelled,

2054
02:06:11,220 --> 02:06:15,750
one of the kids yelled, what? What
outfit are you with? Mac Fifth Marines.

2055
02:06:15,751 --> 02:06:17,820
How about you?
I got a better,

2056
02:06:18,210 --> 02:06:23,210
I'm in polars the troops in the first
thought of the old man before they fall

2057
02:06:23,721 --> 02:06:25,080
out of their regimental number.

2058
02:06:28,350 --> 02:06:28,550
Okay.

2059
02:06:28,550 --> 02:06:33,090
By September 17th d day plus two general
MacArthur was impatient to go ashore

2060
02:06:33,110 --> 02:06:34,790
from the command ship Mount Mckinley.

2061
02:06:35,060 --> 02:06:39,470
He saw that his blow to Korea cut it
into and had taken the enemy by surprise

2062
02:06:39,471 --> 02:06:42,620
and the chances of ending the war.
We're good.

2063
02:06:44,160 --> 02:06:44,993
Okay.

2064
02:06:45,020 --> 02:06:48,410
He radioed Vice Admiral Arthur d Struble,

2065
02:06:48,411 --> 02:06:51,470
the task force commander after
the first good news from shore,

2066
02:06:51,770 --> 02:06:56,030
the navy and Marines have never shown
more brightly than this morning.

2067
02:06:56,210 --> 02:06:57,043
Macarthur

2068
02:07:05,470 --> 02:07:09,250
on one of the fiery days of the drive
towards solar. Popular Chaplain,

2069
02:07:09,251 --> 02:07:13,540
Father Keating captured five North
Korean soldiers and herded them along is

2070
02:07:13,541 --> 02:07:14,374
prisoners.

2071
02:07:14,950 --> 02:07:19,930
He hailed a passing marine jeep
driven by private wolf sawn.

2072
02:07:19,931 --> 02:07:23,140
Take these prisoners off my hands and
get them to the rear before they're hurt.

2073
02:07:23,800 --> 02:07:27,820
I can't father. I'm running ammo into
the edge of town and they're getting low.

2074
02:07:27,910 --> 02:07:31,240
I can't stop to do it private.
That's an order.

2075
02:07:31,940 --> 02:07:32,370
Okay.

2076
02:07:32,370 --> 02:07:36,850
Take them over.
Wolf looked rearward at the burning city.

2077
02:07:37,750 --> 02:07:40,990
You mean their mind now
under my responsibility. Yes.

2078
02:07:42,220 --> 02:07:45,550
Wolf pulled up a light machine
gun and sprayed the troop. Oops.

2079
02:07:46,030 --> 02:07:48,280
Sprayed the group killing
all five prisoners.

2080
02:07:48,910 --> 02:07:52,390
The outraged Keating went to
polar and demanded action.

2081
02:07:52,630 --> 02:07:57,460
Colonel listened carefully, ordered
wolf arrested and the priest went away.

2082
02:07:57,550 --> 02:08:02,530
Content that he had done his duty
10 minutes later. Polar Aston aid.

2083
02:08:02,680 --> 02:08:07,660
What outfit was it that lost all those
boys last night? Barrows company, sir.

2084
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:09,073
All right,

2085
02:08:09,340 --> 02:08:13,450
give that buy Woolful give that boy
wolf a bar and send him up there.

2086
02:08:14,430 --> 02:08:14,890
Okay.

2087
02:08:14,890 --> 02:08:19,390
Jones took the story to his cronies as
an example of the military justice at its

2088
02:08:19,391 --> 02:08:23,920
best. It spread through the outfit
to become part of the polar legend.

2089
02:08:27,270 --> 02:08:28,103
Yeah.

2090
02:08:31,090 --> 02:08:31,923
Yeah.

2091
02:08:32,410 --> 02:08:36,190
That seems like a pretty
squared away thing to do.

2092
02:08:36,370 --> 02:08:41,260
There's like a platoon that's getting
completely destroyed and they've taken a

2093
02:08:41,261 --> 02:08:45,700
bunch of casualties and you've got this
kid that did something wrong and we can

2094
02:08:45,701 --> 02:08:50,560
arrest him and put him in
prison or whatever, or we
could send them up to fight.

2095
02:08:52,920 --> 02:08:53,470
Okay.

2096
02:08:53,470 --> 02:08:54,700
Polar sends him up to fight.

2097
02:08:54,920 --> 02:08:55,753
Okay.

2098
02:08:56,750 --> 02:08:58,070
In the seven days since d day,

2099
02:08:58,071 --> 02:09:02,120
there had been a 1,148 marine casualties,

2100
02:09:02,210 --> 02:09:06,440
145 of these killed, 20 more died
of wounds and five we're missing

2101
02:09:08,870 --> 02:09:09,800
the North Koreans.

2102
02:09:09,830 --> 02:09:14,300
Polar said in his deep drawing voice are
defending the city in such a way as to

2103
02:09:14,420 --> 02:09:18,710
force us to destroy it. There's $1
billion worth of publicity and this,

2104
02:09:18,711 --> 02:09:21,860
so this is when they're trying to get
into soul and the North Koreans would

2105
02:09:21,861 --> 02:09:26,861
offending soul very hard and polar
basically pass to get ultra aggressive

2106
02:09:29,780 --> 02:09:32,060
in trying to take sole.

2107
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:33,880
Okay.

2108
02:09:33,880 --> 02:09:34,541
Back to the book.

2109
02:09:34,541 --> 02:09:37,930
They're fire of artillery and mortars
had set the record for the Korean War.

2110
02:09:38,080 --> 02:09:42,190
The four battalions of artillery had
fired all shells at hand and had depleted

2111
02:09:42,191 --> 02:09:43,480
in nearby army dump.

2112
02:09:43,960 --> 02:09:48,960
At 4.2 mortars had fired 326
rounds and the big 81 650 rounds.

2113
02:09:50,410 --> 02:09:54,910
That 50 caliber machine guns had
used 120 boxes or 30,000 rounds.

2114
02:09:55,570 --> 02:09:57,970
The night's battle would
put Lieutenant Joe Fisher,

2115
02:09:58,390 --> 02:10:00,970
Lieutenant Joe Fisher's
item company to the test.

2116
02:10:01,330 --> 02:10:04,960
Fisher dug in for the night on an isolated
hill and the city's factory district

2117
02:10:05,230 --> 02:10:09,190
overlooking the roadblock which was on
his left flank from midnight to dawn.

2118
02:10:09,191 --> 02:10:10,750
He beat off waves of attack.

2119
02:10:12,890 --> 02:10:15,900
Fisher called for artillery.
At the same time, uh,

2120
02:10:16,220 --> 02:10:18,380
other frontline commanders asked for help,

2121
02:10:18,470 --> 02:10:23,470
but between barrages from the North
Korean swept up Fisher's hill in a bonsai

2122
02:10:23,571 --> 02:10:26,840
charges urged by shrill
force commanders in the rear.

2123
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:28,350
Okay.

2124
02:10:28,350 --> 02:10:29,131
Item companies,

2125
02:10:29,131 --> 02:10:33,590
weapons including machine guns fired
at top speed and bodies piled up them

2126
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:35,660
toward the end.
When the attacks weekend,

2127
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:39,890
the fight turned into a Turkey shoot
and fishers men slaughtered the enemy.

2128
02:10:41,300 --> 02:10:44,960
They were glad to see the sunrise.
Fisher never forgot that. Daybreak.

2129
02:10:45,110 --> 02:10:48,920
I looked down the hill behind me and saw
man hurrying up towards our position.

2130
02:10:49,610 --> 02:10:52,670
I could see that he wasn't lugging any
ammunition and thought it must be an

2131
02:10:52,671 --> 02:10:55,100
important message,
too hot for the radio.

2132
02:10:56,120 --> 02:10:56,440
Okay.

2133
02:10:56,440 --> 02:11:00,910
Then I saw that it was colonel polars
runner and he had brought us a bottle of

2134
02:11:00,911 --> 02:11:03,820
black and white scotch.
My God,

2135
02:11:03,821 --> 02:11:07,060
where are we glad to see that it was
passed down to the platoon with the most

2136
02:11:07,061 --> 02:11:10,240
casualties and they rationed it
out to those who needed it most.

2137
02:11:11,140 --> 02:11:16,140
We knew then that the old man was thinking
of us and in fact never forgot us.

2138
02:11:20,280 --> 02:11:24,630
Polar came upon marines Duggin around
a barricade taking cover from fire down

2139
02:11:24,631 --> 02:11:28,560
the street. He walked among them with
the pipe stub in his mouth, get up, boys,

2140
02:11:28,680 --> 02:11:32,370
get up and go. That's the quickest way to
get it over. If you're going to get it,

2141
02:11:32,700 --> 02:11:36,870
you can get it in holes
to the line. Moved.

2142
02:11:37,710 --> 02:11:39,510
Jo Fisher saw polar in the street.

2143
02:11:39,660 --> 02:11:43,680
He was going along where the fire was
heaviest just like he was back in Penelton

2144
02:11:43,830 --> 02:11:45,960
as if he didn't know there
was a fight within miles.

2145
02:11:46,140 --> 02:11:49,920
I couldn't express how much good it did
me and my troops to see him steady like

2146
02:11:49,921 --> 02:11:51,600
that,
just puffing that pipe.

2147
02:11:52,550 --> 02:11:55,980
It made us feel like we could do no
less than he did if there's ever been

2148
02:11:55,981 --> 02:11:59,640
another one like him in the Marine Corps.
I never saw him in my day.

2149
02:12:03,800 --> 02:12:04,880
Bill for Ringo,

2150
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:10,280
the veteran who is the field sergeant
major had a glimpse of the kernel.

2151
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:14,660
It was like going through hell passing
down that sole street and who should we

2152
02:12:14,661 --> 02:12:15,740
pass in the middle of it,

2153
02:12:15,860 --> 02:12:20,860
but chesty it was so hot that I thought
the grenades and ammunition we carried

2154
02:12:20,931 --> 02:12:25,220
would explode. The flames almost met
over our heads from the burning houses,

2155
02:12:25,340 --> 02:12:27,650
but the colonel didn't seem
in the least concerned.

2156
02:12:28,920 --> 02:12:30,410
It gave us an extra push.

2157
02:12:36,600 --> 02:12:39,630
One of the most vague wrap
up this Inchon invasion,

2158
02:12:39,631 --> 02:12:42,900
one of the most demanding operations in
marine history. It ended the division.

2159
02:12:42,901 --> 02:12:45,570
It's sustained to 2,430 casualties.

2160
02:12:45,571 --> 02:12:48,330
414 of them dead of this total,

2161
02:12:48,331 --> 02:12:53,040
1064 had been in the last five days in
the streets of Seoul and its outskirts.

2162
02:12:53,730 --> 02:12:57,780
Murray's fifth marines had the
worst of it with 1038 casualties,

2163
02:12:57,790 --> 02:13:02,790
177 dead polo had a total of 787
with 92 dead Litzenberg 368 72 dead.

2164
02:13:11,460 --> 02:13:12,293
Okay.

2165
02:13:12,460 --> 02:13:17,440
Polar wrote another letter to his wife.
Everything is quiet now.

2166
02:13:17,441 --> 02:13:20,530
I'd have little to do except get
my reports prepared and submitted.

2167
02:13:20,920 --> 02:13:25,920
I wish I had a flair for writing as I
as that I am certain this regiment would

2168
02:13:26,321 --> 02:13:29,680
get the credit, do them. When the history
of this operation is finally written,

2169
02:13:30,820 --> 02:13:34,830
now knows, but in a few years
what is written, we'll govern.

2170
02:13:35,670 --> 02:13:40,170
Rest assured that I will do a better job
of getting the facts in my reports that

2171
02:13:40,171 --> 02:13:44,430
I did in the past war. I will also
claim everything. Do the regimen.

2172
02:13:44,670 --> 02:13:48,420
Many times I've regretted that my English
education was cut short during the

2173
02:13:48,421 --> 02:13:49,254
first war.

2174
02:13:50,070 --> 02:13:53,640
Please do your best to impress upon
our children the necessity of taking

2175
02:13:53,641 --> 02:13:55,470
advantage of every opportunity

2176
02:13:57,570 --> 02:14:00,450
in this hard old world of ours.

2177
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:07,130
So he recognized, you know, sad
thing. It's a reality though.

2178
02:14:08,120 --> 02:14:10,580
If you're in a leadership
position in the military,

2179
02:14:10,610 --> 02:14:13,310
you got to be able to write
well and he regrets that.

2180
02:14:13,311 --> 02:14:14,990
He wasn't a little better at it.

2181
02:14:17,750 --> 02:14:20,600
So pay attention to the
English class folks.

2182
02:14:25,230 --> 02:14:26,063
Yeah,

2183
02:14:26,550 --> 02:14:28,260
polar went ashore.
They were back at,

2184
02:14:28,261 --> 02:14:32,490
see Pauline went ashore in one of major
Treadwell's landing craft to be met

2185
02:14:32,491 --> 02:14:37,110
broadly by a grinning Oliver Smith.
Congratulations Louie. You made it.

2186
02:14:37,680 --> 02:14:39,840
Your board is selected you for Brigadier.

2187
02:14:40,980 --> 02:14:44,010
Polar wagged his head by God.
If it hadn't been for this war,

2188
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:45,600
I'd never gotten that star.

2189
02:14:45,690 --> 02:14:49,320
There was a mild celebration ashore
that night for the new general to be.

2190
02:14:49,321 --> 02:14:50,340
So he picked up,

2191
02:14:51,060 --> 02:14:55,770
picked up his first star has a general,
and like you said,

2192
02:14:55,771 --> 02:14:56,850
if it wasn't for the,
you know,

2193
02:14:56,890 --> 02:15:00,000
he'd been put down in some
reserve unit New Orleans.

2194
02:15:00,001 --> 02:15:04,320
He wasn't going to make general there,
but case of war break glass.

2195
02:15:05,220 --> 02:15:07,830
Now he makes general
polar wrote home daily.

2196
02:15:07,950 --> 02:15:12,000
He sent Virginia $5 check for
her good school and Mark A.

2197
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:16,080
Good school marks,
adding some parental advice.

2198
02:15:16,230 --> 02:15:20,610
I'm very proud of my family and expect
you to do well plus in everything you

2199
02:15:20,611 --> 02:15:21,444
undertake.

2200
02:15:21,690 --> 02:15:26,550
The difference between success and failure
in this life of ours is mostly hard

2201
02:15:26,551 --> 02:15:30,360
work. So you must constantly
work to try and improve yourself.

2202
02:15:32,460 --> 02:15:34,110
I think we can just frame that statement.

2203
02:15:38,290 --> 02:15:41,980
On November 10th the
marine corps birthday,

2204
02:15:41,981 --> 02:15:45,940
polar used a captured North Korean
store to slice a hundred pound cake.

2205
02:15:46,750 --> 02:15:51,550
He shouted to his troops after
he got done delivering the,

2206
02:15:51,590 --> 02:15:55,510
um, article from a manual, he shouted out.

2207
02:15:55,511 --> 02:15:58,180
Now that that's complied with,
I want to tell you something straight.

2208
02:15:58,570 --> 02:16:00,370
Just do one thing for me,
right?

2209
02:16:00,371 --> 02:16:04,360
Your people back home and tell him there
was one hell of a damn war going on out

2210
02:16:04,361 --> 02:16:08,530
here and that the raggedy tailed North
Koreans have been whipping a lot of so

2211
02:16:08,531 --> 02:16:10,690
called good American
troops and may do it again.

2212
02:16:10,900 --> 02:16:12,910
Tell them there's no secret
weapon for our country,

2213
02:16:12,911 --> 02:16:15,310
but to get hard to get in there and fight,

2214
02:16:16,450 --> 02:16:20,380
I want you to make them understand our
country won't go on forever if we stay as

2215
02:16:20,381 --> 02:16:21,760
soft as we are now,

2216
02:16:22,300 --> 02:16:27,300
there won't be any America because some
foreign soldiers soldiery will invade us

2217
02:16:27,550 --> 02:16:30,310
and take our women and a hardier race.

2218
02:16:34,060 --> 02:16:37,570
Yeah, there you go.
He's not playing around.

2219
02:16:37,970 --> 02:16:40,000
Isn't it interesting that
we hear the same things now?

2220
02:16:40,090 --> 02:16:44,380
Like America's getting soft? Polar
was general. Polar was saying

2221
02:16:48,720 --> 02:16:50,310
after the marines had taken soul,

2222
02:16:50,311 --> 02:16:53,880
the eighth army of the United Nations
forces had driven through the Capitol

2223
02:16:53,881 --> 02:16:57,360
moving rapidly northward along
the Korean coast to meet them.

2224
02:16:57,361 --> 02:17:02,361
Chinese Communist armories had marched
1800 miles north words since Megan mid

2225
02:17:02,640 --> 02:17:02,880
August.

2226
02:17:02,880 --> 02:17:07,620
The Chinese strategists at
first concentrated against
the eighth army position

2227
02:17:07,621 --> 02:17:09,960
in Northwestern hills,
but when the marines landed,

2228
02:17:10,320 --> 02:17:15,030
they heard lead switched much of the power
to meet the o meat and overwhelm them

2229
02:17:15,510 --> 02:17:16,860
in the chosen reservoir.

2230
02:17:17,880 --> 02:17:21,710
The Chinese drove between the Marines
and the eighth army and maneuvered into

2231
02:17:21,720 --> 02:17:25,470
position from which they could
attack each force at will.

2232
02:17:27,030 --> 02:17:27,863
So

2233
02:17:31,690 --> 02:17:36,070
podcast number 53 colder than hell.
It was about the chosen reservoir.

2234
02:17:36,490 --> 02:17:38,170
And there's another one,
I forget the number,

2235
02:17:39,130 --> 02:17:44,110
but we've done two podcasts about the
chosen reservoir. Listen to those.

2236
02:17:45,650 --> 02:17:46,140
Okay,

2237
02:17:46,140 --> 02:17:50,540
touch on it here as well. From the
hills on every side of the perimeter,

2238
02:17:50,541 --> 02:17:52,400
Chinese fire was heavy during the day.

2239
02:17:52,550 --> 02:17:55,340
The enemy blew a tunnel and a
bridge on the railroad below.

2240
02:17:55,520 --> 02:18:00,520
Cota reposition cutting the line to Ha
Hamhung and the Marine base on the sea

2241
02:18:01,520 --> 02:18:02,151
for two days.

2242
02:18:02,151 --> 02:18:06,500
Polar caller called in heavy air strikes
upon concentrations of Chinese in the

2243
02:18:06,501 --> 02:18:07,460
surrounding hills.

2244
02:18:08,480 --> 02:18:11,390
Things were even worse than the two
positions to the north of polar.

2245
02:18:11,960 --> 02:18:16,580
At least six Chinese divisions had been
identified in the area where Marie and

2246
02:18:16,581 --> 02:18:16,911
listened.

2247
02:18:16,911 --> 02:18:21,911
Berg fought on November 26th these two
posts lost 95 dead in 543 wounded in

2248
02:18:24,861 --> 02:18:29,861
night long attacks hag a room was
preparing to fight for its life and all

2249
02:18:32,241 --> 02:18:36,800
offensive launched by the fifth marines
was called off after the day's grim news

2250
02:18:36,801 --> 02:18:40,430
from the West.
The eighth army had collapsed,

2251
02:18:41,240 --> 02:18:45,440
one wing of it was torn to pieces and
the Chinese were slashing deep into the

2252
02:18:45,441 --> 02:18:46,100
lines.

2253
02:18:46,100 --> 02:18:51,080
Marines must now defend themselves
in an enemy free against an enemy.

2254
02:18:51,081 --> 02:18:54,890
Free to approach from any direction
through the frozen mountains.

2255
02:18:57,530 --> 02:19:02,530
The night of November 27th tested the
men at Udab knee when the three Chinese

2256
02:19:03,051 --> 02:19:07,780
division divisions fell upon
two marine regiments. The end.

2257
02:19:07,781 --> 02:19:12,230
We cut the road to hog guru and sent
their assault battalions in quilted

2258
02:19:12,231 --> 02:19:16,670
uniforms and sneakers into the marine
lines with disregard for casualties.

2259
02:19:16,820 --> 02:19:19,040
The first waves were driven
off with great losses,

2260
02:19:19,041 --> 02:19:21,050
but the others were thrown into,

2261
02:19:21,320 --> 02:19:25,340
thrown in through the night and the
next to the dismay of the Chinese

2262
02:19:25,341 --> 02:19:30,230
commander's not even the envelopment of
marine command posts slowed the temple

2263
02:19:30,260 --> 02:19:33,650
fighting and the American
stage vicious counter attacks.

2264
02:19:33,680 --> 02:19:37,190
Even when many platoons had been
reduced to the size of squads,

2265
02:19:38,660 --> 02:19:42,170
there were not enough tent for marine
wounded and the less seriously hurt were

2266
02:19:42,171 --> 02:19:46,100
piled outside close together
for warmth covered with Straw.

2267
02:19:46,640 --> 02:19:51,320
As doctors worked over the
more than 500 casualties

2268
02:19:55,530 --> 02:19:58,990
and now became clear that the three
marine positions in the chosen area,

2269
02:19:58,991 --> 02:19:59,950
we're surrounded.

2270
02:20:00,380 --> 02:20:01,213
Yeah.

2271
02:20:01,230 --> 02:20:05,790
Polars reaction to the dread news was
given to newspaper men who flew in to

2272
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:08,010
[inaudible].
Here's what polar said.

2273
02:20:08,011 --> 02:20:11,850
We've been looking for the enemy for
several days now. We finally found them.

2274
02:20:11,940 --> 02:20:12,960
We're surrounded.

2275
02:20:13,670 --> 02:20:14,010
Okay.

2276
02:20:14,010 --> 02:20:17,010
That's simplifies our problem with
getting these people and killing them.

2277
02:20:20,520 --> 02:20:21,353
Okay.

2278
02:20:21,730 --> 02:20:25,330
Yeah. Do you wonder, there's no
wonder why this guy's a legend.

2279
02:20:27,880 --> 02:20:31,720
Polar prepared to open the road to
Hungary with Task Force Drysdale,

2280
02:20:31,721 --> 02:20:36,040
a British commando unit of Royal Marines
under Lieutenant Douglas Drysdale,

2281
02:20:36,041 --> 02:20:40,060
accompanied by Captain Carl Sitters,
company of Ridges Battalion,

2282
02:20:40,210 --> 02:20:45,160
and a company from the 31st Army right
army regiment which had come in the road,

2283
02:20:45,161 --> 02:20:49,630
had been blocked in several places to
bridges were out and the Chinese swarmed

2284
02:20:49,631 --> 02:20:51,430
on heights overlooking the route.

2285
02:20:52,930 --> 02:20:55,000
The party met bitter
opposition and within a few,

2286
02:20:55,030 --> 02:20:59,410
within a few minutes at 14
casualties in three hours and half,

2287
02:20:59,440 --> 02:21:02,890
three hours and a half, they moved
only two miles with eight more to go.

2288
02:21:03,970 --> 02:21:08,770
Polar sent tanks as support and men came
down from the hills to walk with them.

2289
02:21:08,920 --> 02:21:11,590
They fought through roadblocks
and around a blown bridge,

2290
02:21:11,591 --> 02:21:16,591
but at dusk and narrowed defile the met
an ambush and took serious casualties by

2291
02:21:19,651 --> 02:21:20,880
radio polar.

2292
02:21:21,150 --> 02:21:24,810
Oliver Smith and Drysdale agreed that
the unit must push on to hog or through

2293
02:21:24,811 --> 02:21:26,010
whatever the cost.

2294
02:21:26,220 --> 02:21:31,220
The Royal Marines finally reached Hogger
route perimeter at 1:30 AM with 90 of

2295
02:21:31,441 --> 02:21:36,441
it's 255 men casualties sit or had 63
only 70 of the 210 army men made it

2296
02:21:39,990 --> 02:21:44,430
a truck column sent behind this ill fated
party was virtually destroyed after a

2297
02:21:44,431 --> 02:21:49,431
long fight and parlay with the Chinese
who captured all the trucks and most of

2298
02:21:50,311 --> 02:21:51,144
the men,

2299
02:21:53,210 --> 02:21:56,660
the survivors of this party were
crucial to the, to the defense of Haga.

2300
02:21:56,661 --> 02:22:01,370
Rune there added firepower, help turn
back another massive Chinese attack.

2301
02:22:01,520 --> 02:22:05,030
The companies have sitter and Jo
Fisher killed the enemy in droves.

2302
02:22:05,210 --> 02:22:09,770
And by the next dawn there
lines though bent handheld

2303
02:22:17,440 --> 02:22:20,800
on the night of December 7th the bulk
of the division was in polars perimeter.

2304
02:22:20,801 --> 02:22:23,560
After the 38 hour battle from Haga row,

2305
02:22:24,730 --> 02:22:29,550
the 103 dead, 506 wounded, seven missing,

2306
02:22:29,790 --> 02:22:34,790
but now the force of 10,000 and it's
1000 vehicles was that [inaudible] the

2307
02:22:35,971 --> 02:22:37,710
perimeter could hardly contain them all.

2308
02:22:42,430 --> 02:22:44,980
After supper,
the colonel disappeared.

2309
02:22:44,981 --> 02:22:48,700
Only Sergeant Jones and I
haven't mentioned much about
Sergeant Jones. He's like,

2310
02:22:49,570 --> 02:22:53,680
he's, he's polars right hand man through
this, through all kinds of crazy stuff.

2311
02:22:54,520 --> 02:22:57,850
And Sergeant Jones,
only Sergeant Jones knew where he was.

2312
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:01,660
The old man would sneak off with Bodey
and go up into the lion's climbing right

2313
02:23:01,661 --> 02:23:03,460
up into those damn straight up hills,

2314
02:23:03,640 --> 02:23:06,790
all the ice and rock going from
hole to hole for half the night.

2315
02:23:06,940 --> 02:23:09,790
He would go to every man he
could find in a foxhole and say,

2316
02:23:09,791 --> 02:23:13,180
how you doing old man? What's your
field of fire? Who's on your flank?

2317
02:23:13,240 --> 02:23:16,480
You get enough chow on the way back,
he would check.

2318
02:23:16,481 --> 02:23:20,050
The warming tends to see if there'd been
casualties and how the men were doing.

2319
02:23:22,430 --> 02:23:26,240
Early on December eight the marines began
clearing the ridges on either side of

2320
02:23:26,241 --> 02:23:27,740
the road south,

2321
02:23:28,580 --> 02:23:32,780
but the going was slow and the truck's
bearing the bridge sections made little

2322
02:23:32,781 --> 02:23:34,010
project progress.

2323
02:23:35,300 --> 02:23:40,280
A funeral for 117 marines in a common
grave brought the day to an end in the

2324
02:23:40,281 --> 02:23:41,114
perimeter.

2325
02:23:41,880 --> 02:23:42,200
Okay.

2326
02:23:42,200 --> 02:23:44,360
It was a scene that
lived in polars memory,

2327
02:23:44,600 --> 02:23:47,420
the burial of frozen
bodies by a tank battalion,

2328
02:23:47,570 --> 02:23:49,760
which crushed them under frozen ground.

2329
02:23:50,680 --> 02:23:50,960
Okay.

2330
02:23:50,960 --> 02:23:53,460
A marine photographer
took movies of the burial.

2331
02:23:53,670 --> 02:23:58,110
Polar said how I wish our people could
have seen this site to see just what

2332
02:23:58,111 --> 02:23:59,460
happened to us and Korea.

2333
02:24:01,160 --> 02:24:01,960
Yeah.

2334
02:24:01,960 --> 02:24:06,960
He later heard that army censorship in
Washington kept the film from the public.

2335
02:24:11,610 --> 02:24:11,930
Okay,

2336
02:24:11,930 --> 02:24:15,660
and now there
again,

2337
02:24:15,661 --> 02:24:19,580
that's very compressed story, but they're
breaking out and they're heading south.

2338
02:24:19,581 --> 02:24:24,080
Getting heading back to the sea
and back to safety. Out of the,

2339
02:24:24,230 --> 02:24:26,510
out of being surrounded back to the book,

2340
02:24:26,511 --> 02:24:30,050
the fifth and Seventh Marines had now
pass through polars ranks in the first was

2341
02:24:30,051 --> 02:24:33,650
the rear guard for the entire division
responsible for covering the withdraw

2342
02:24:33,651 --> 02:24:35,330
down the frozen loops of the road.

2343
02:24:36,290 --> 02:24:41,290
Polar started down and hundreds of men
saw him for he thought that his job had

2344
02:24:41,661 --> 02:24:42,560
only be gone.

2345
02:24:42,680 --> 02:24:47,330
He shouted to every passing unit to
cheer the men yelling until he was horse.

2346
02:24:47,450 --> 02:24:49,340
Don't forget that your first marines,

2347
02:24:49,460 --> 02:24:52,160
not all the communists
and hell can overrun you.

2348
02:24:57,110 --> 02:25:01,650
Okay?
Okay.

2349
02:25:02,850 --> 02:25:03,810
When he got back,

2350
02:25:04,950 --> 02:25:09,950
reporters found him and they wanted
a statement from him and he said,

2351
02:25:10,741 --> 02:25:13,350
remember, whatever you
write, this was no retreat.

2352
02:25:14,130 --> 02:25:17,610
All that happened was we found more
Chinese behind us then in front of us.

2353
02:25:17,790 --> 02:25:20,370
So we about faced and attacked.

2354
02:25:27,110 --> 02:25:32,110
Smith recommended polar for a navy cross
for his work in the reservoir campaign.

2355
02:25:33,980 --> 02:25:36,830
His fifth and the Marine Corps record

2356
02:25:38,290 --> 02:25:41,950
pullers letter to his wife revealed his
unusual concern for his family in the

2357
02:25:41,951 --> 02:25:45,040
midst of the campaigning.
Please tell Lewis that's his son.

2358
02:25:45,220 --> 02:25:48,220
Please tell Louis that I will finally
come home and teach him how to shoot and

2359
02:25:48,221 --> 02:25:50,530
many other things that
boys and men must know.

2360
02:25:51,240 --> 02:25:55,150
Tell him to be patient and the swords
and the helmet I sent him will arrive.

2361
02:25:55,330 --> 02:25:59,080
Tell him to change his bait in
the rabbit trap every few days.

2362
02:25:59,081 --> 02:26:01,630
A piece of Apple Lettuce,
carrot, celery, turnip,

2363
02:26:01,930 --> 02:26:05,470
and he must not go near the trap or touch
it except to change the bait when the

2364
02:26:05,471 --> 02:26:08,860
doors sprung. Also, we must
keep the dog away from it

2365
02:26:11,710 --> 02:26:12,930
to what he's telling his boy.

2366
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:16,113
Okay.

2367
02:26:16,870 --> 02:26:20,440
He continues on in a letter to his wife.
I haven't minded the hardships here,

2368
02:26:20,441 --> 02:26:25,000
but the killing and crippling of young
men is awful due to the weather or

2369
02:26:25,001 --> 02:26:28,750
wounded, die blood plasma freezes
before it can be administered.

2370
02:26:30,010 --> 02:26:34,510
I realized that this war is for harder
on you than it has beyond me than it has

2371
02:26:34,511 --> 02:26:38,470
been on me and I'm sorry to have
caused you all the worry and pain.

2372
02:26:42,210 --> 02:26:46,410
Then he goes on to say the Pentagon is
largely responsible for this mess out

2373
02:26:46,411 --> 02:26:48,600
here. They weren't even given. They were,

2374
02:26:48,630 --> 02:26:51,840
they were given the money to
provide us and train an army.

2375
02:26:51,960 --> 02:26:52,980
When I entered the service,

2376
02:26:52,981 --> 02:26:57,630
the regulation stated that the object
of all military training is success in

2377
02:26:57,631 --> 02:26:58,464
battle.

2378
02:27:00,210 --> 02:27:04,650
This short sentence has been rewritten
on three pages and I defy anyone to read

2379
02:27:04,651 --> 02:27:08,250
over three or more times and then
explain to me what the object of military

2380
02:27:08,251 --> 02:27:09,084
training is.

2381
02:27:10,770 --> 02:27:15,770
Even the Pentagon has not the slightest
idea why they are commanding forces of

2382
02:27:17,071 --> 02:27:19,560
the United States.
In fact,

2383
02:27:19,561 --> 02:27:22,470
out here we wonder if we are
part of the United States

2384
02:27:25,160 --> 02:27:28,730
and here he talks about his son again,
tone his wife. I will not influence.

2385
02:27:28,731 --> 02:27:32,210
My son has to choosing a profession.
It will be up to him.

2386
02:27:32,450 --> 02:27:34,520
I will not even recommend the service.

2387
02:27:35,560 --> 02:27:36,290
Yeah.

2388
02:27:36,290 --> 02:27:40,400
I've had to stand with my mouth closed
on too many occasions and then carry out

2389
02:27:40,401 --> 02:27:42,710
orders from too many halfwits.

2390
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:46,833
Okay,

2391
02:27:47,060 --> 02:27:49,850
so as much as he loves the Marine
Corp and the military and the country,

2392
02:27:49,851 --> 02:27:51,200
he's saying, look, I might not even,

2393
02:27:51,580 --> 02:27:53,840
I'm not going to even
recommend that my son joins.

2394
02:28:00,930 --> 02:28:04,020
He gets his painting of his star.
Finally,

2395
02:28:04,021 --> 02:28:07,050
he's actually being officially made
a general and he makes a speech.

2396
02:28:07,051 --> 02:28:11,820
All the credit for this star belongs
to the non coms junior officers and

2397
02:28:11,821 --> 02:28:14,580
enlisted men.
You all know that.

2398
02:28:14,790 --> 02:28:18,690
I've tried to do my duty but we'd never
get anywhere except for you fellows in

2399
02:28:18,691 --> 02:28:22,070
the ranks.
This is a great regimen and it's going

2400
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:23,110
to hurt me to leave you.

2401
02:28:24,130 --> 02:28:25,240
I'll never forget you.

2402
02:28:26,150 --> 02:28:26,470
Okay.

2403
02:28:26,470 --> 02:28:28,210
To the man of task force polar,

2404
02:28:28,480 --> 02:28:32,230
he also issued a formal memorandum
in compliance with orders.

2405
02:28:32,231 --> 02:28:36,100
I am today leaving this command for
assignment as division commander,

2406
02:28:36,730 --> 02:28:38,050
assistant division commander.

2407
02:28:38,260 --> 02:28:41,950
It is not without misgivings and a
certain reluctance that I carry out these

2408
02:28:41,951 --> 02:28:42,784
orders.

2409
02:28:42,900 --> 02:28:43,170
Okay.

2410
02:28:43,170 --> 02:28:45,900
All of you officers and men alike realize,

2411
02:28:45,901 --> 02:28:49,350
I am sure what the First Marine
regiment has meant to me.

2412
02:28:50,260 --> 02:28:50,890
Okay.

2413
02:28:50,890 --> 02:28:54,640
I ask one more thing of you give my
successor the same full measure of

2414
02:28:54,641 --> 02:28:58,720
cooperation and willingness you have
always given me and the first marines will

2415
02:28:58,721 --> 02:29:00,940
be worthy of the name.
It has already won.

2416
02:29:02,600 --> 02:29:03,190
Okay.

2417
02:29:03,190 --> 02:29:07,990
I first commanded you on new Britain
later on the bloody hills of Pell Lou and

2418
02:29:07,991 --> 02:29:12,991
it is my and has been my honor to command
you in Korea where by your deeds you

2419
02:29:13,841 --> 02:29:15,400
captured the city of Seoul,

2420
02:29:15,520 --> 02:29:19,210
then successfully covered the withdrawal
of our division from the chosen

2421
02:29:19,211 --> 02:29:20,290
reservoir area.

2422
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:21,930
Okay.

2423
02:29:21,930 --> 02:29:26,930
I shall look to future to your future
movements and shall expect to hear and see

2424
02:29:28,140 --> 02:29:33,000
still greater deeds and higher reputation.
One on the field of battle.

2425
02:29:46,310 --> 02:29:47,510
I talked a little bit about,

2426
02:29:48,110 --> 02:29:48,440
okay.

2427
02:29:48,440 --> 02:29:50,390
The dichotomy in his reputation

2428
02:29:53,270 --> 02:29:55,280
polars reputation grew among the men,

2429
02:29:55,370 --> 02:29:59,330
but Sergeant Jones noted that the
old man was regarded as a man eater.

2430
02:30:00,240 --> 02:30:01,073
Yeah.

2431
02:30:01,110 --> 02:30:05,640
They would ask Bodie and me over and over,
how the hell we kept our stripes.

2432
02:30:05,790 --> 02:30:09,570
They thought he chewed on people all
the time and when there was a fight,

2433
02:30:09,660 --> 02:30:11,610
recklessly exposed his people.

2434
02:30:12,600 --> 02:30:12,930
Okay.

2435
02:30:12,930 --> 02:30:15,120
And of course we knew better.

2436
02:30:16,040 --> 02:30:19,040
It was hard to convince guys
who had heard so much about him,

2437
02:30:19,041 --> 02:30:20,120
but didn't really know him.

2438
02:30:21,080 --> 02:30:21,320
Okay.

2439
02:30:21,320 --> 02:30:26,240
When you got close to him, you found
he had a heart as big as all outdoors.

2440
02:30:33,310 --> 02:30:34,143
Okay.

2441
02:30:34,690 --> 02:30:38,650
They continued to not make
friends up the chain of command.

2442
02:30:39,100 --> 02:30:40,420
We can't help to win.

2443
02:30:40,421 --> 02:30:44,050
We can't hope to win future wars and we
got the hell beat out of us and Korea,

2444
02:30:44,051 --> 02:30:47,800
unless we have discipline and it's
going to take some brutality to get it.

2445
02:30:50,930 --> 02:30:51,763
Okay.

2446
02:30:51,890 --> 02:30:56,510
His last days in Korea were frustrating
to Paula who found things suddenly

2447
02:30:56,511 --> 02:30:58,250
different. He wrote his wife. Now,

2448
02:30:58,251 --> 02:31:02,060
age has probably changed me
and the core has changed too,

2449
02:31:02,061 --> 02:31:05,900
I suppose too, man,
being what he is today,

2450
02:31:06,020 --> 02:31:09,080
I never thought this change
could or would happen.

2451
02:31:09,530 --> 02:31:11,690
Maybe I have been wrong
from the beginning.

2452
02:31:15,900 --> 02:31:16,590
No,

2453
02:31:16,590 --> 02:31:21,590
he gets back to America and of course
there's a big bunch of reporters waiting

2454
02:31:23,071 --> 02:31:27,180
for them and they kind of know
the kind of know he's got a

2455
02:31:28,780 --> 02:31:33,730
a mouth, right. So they're, they're
fired up to talk to them and

2456
02:31:37,190 --> 02:31:39,740
he's starts talking to the
reporters and here we go.

2457
02:31:40,190 --> 02:31:43,490
What the American people want to do
is fight a war without getting hurt.

2458
02:31:43,640 --> 02:31:44,780
You can't do any good.

2459
02:31:44,781 --> 02:31:48,860
You can't do that any more than you can
go into a bar room brawl without getting

2460
02:31:48,861 --> 02:31:53,480
hurt, unless the American people are
willing to send their sons out to fight an

2461
02:31:53,481 --> 02:31:57,080
aggressor. There's just not
going to be any United States.

2462
02:31:57,290 --> 02:31:59,630
A bunch of foreign
soldiers will take over.

2463
02:32:00,280 --> 02:32:00,630
Yeah.

2464
02:32:00,630 --> 02:32:04,020
Air Power can't live up to its
billing out here, somebody,

2465
02:32:04,260 --> 02:32:08,490
not so much the aviators as the aircraft
manufacturers has sold the American

2466
02:32:08,491 --> 02:32:12,780
people a bill of goods as to what air
power can do. From what I've seen,

2467
02:32:12,960 --> 02:32:13,711
one bomb,

2468
02:32:13,711 --> 02:32:18,690
we'll hit a section of railroad track
and 100 bombs will miss some of them by

2469
02:32:18,691 --> 02:32:19,524
miles.

2470
02:32:20,520 --> 02:32:25,260
The enemy puts Cooley's on the track
with picks and shovels and in 24 hours

2471
02:32:25,350 --> 02:32:29,310
they're rolling again.
The answer is infantry.

2472
02:32:30,060 --> 02:32:30,640
Okay.

2473
02:32:30,640 --> 02:32:32,260
Our officer core has,

2474
02:32:32,650 --> 02:32:37,180
has had far too much schooling and
far too little combat experience.

2475
02:32:37,240 --> 02:32:42,240
They can't warn learn war like that push
button war is this far off as in the

2476
02:32:44,891 --> 02:32:48,490
days of Julius Caesar,
the rifle,

2477
02:32:48,970 --> 02:32:53,560
hand grenade and band net are
still the most important weapons.

2478
02:32:54,380 --> 02:32:57,250
We are going to lose the next
war if we don't get back to them.

2479
02:32:57,550 --> 02:33:02,500
Why half our infantry out there is still
armed with carbines against the enemy,

2480
02:33:02,501 --> 02:33:04,240
with their fine Russian rifles.

2481
02:33:05,490 --> 02:33:05,980
Yeah.

2482
02:33:05,980 --> 02:33:08,500
He then turned on the training
give marines which could be,

2483
02:33:08,530 --> 02:33:11,050
which he would soon be
conducting at Camp Pendleton.

2484
02:33:11,260 --> 02:33:15,340
We've got to get them tougher to
survive for all these girls out of camp.

2485
02:33:15,580 --> 02:33:18,940
Get rid of the ice cream and candy.
Get some pride in them.

2486
02:33:19,420 --> 02:33:24,150
That's what we need most of all pride.
A reporter piped up.

2487
02:33:24,390 --> 02:33:28,290
What do you think of the protest of the
women's Christian Temperance Union over

2488
02:33:28,291 --> 02:33:32,880
sending free beer to the troops?
It's news to me, Paula said,

2489
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:36,810
but if a few cans of beer or a snort of
whiskey will make the men fight better,

2490
02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:38,520
it might not be a bad idea.

2491
02:33:39,450 --> 02:33:42,810
At least it's better than ice
cream and all this soft training.

2492
02:33:43,830 --> 02:33:44,330
Okay,

2493
02:33:44,330 --> 02:33:46,820
there's too much damn recreation
and military training.

2494
02:33:47,030 --> 02:33:51,200
We should have only one
purpose to fight and win.

2495
02:33:52,610 --> 02:33:53,090
Okay?

2496
02:33:53,090 --> 02:33:54,710
They're not being taught that now.

2497
02:33:57,380 --> 02:33:59,240
So he's an outspoken guy.

2498
02:34:00,230 --> 02:34:03,500
He was astonished the next day
to see the following headlines.

2499
02:34:03,501 --> 02:34:08,420
Major General wants beer and
whiskey for the troops. Ice Cream,

2500
02:34:08,421 --> 02:34:13,310
Gis, lambasted, bipolar marine
general blast, the air force,

2501
02:34:14,330 --> 02:34:17,150
the fewer reached across the nation.

2502
02:34:18,180 --> 02:34:22,570
And there was actually protests
against general polar. Uh,

2503
02:34:23,500 --> 02:34:26,500
here's, here's, they've actually put
one of these letters in the book.

2504
02:34:26,530 --> 02:34:28,660
We hereby petitions.
This is sent to the,

2505
02:34:28,810 --> 02:34:31,840
to the government or to the Pentagon.

2506
02:34:31,930 --> 02:34:36,370
We hereby petition do you to use every
ounce of influence that you possess to

2507
02:34:36,371 --> 02:34:39,370
keep brigadier general
polar from inaugurating,

2508
02:34:39,430 --> 02:34:43,540
his beer and whiskey campaign
and US military training camps.

2509
02:34:47,110 --> 02:34:48,370
But the,
uh,

2510
02:34:48,490 --> 02:34:52,900
the panic did die down and he got
to the business of training marines.

2511
02:34:55,440 --> 02:34:56,273
And

2512
02:34:56,970 --> 02:35:01,710
in August of 1953 polar took examinations
for major general. That's two star.

2513
02:35:02,010 --> 02:35:02,671
The board,

2514
02:35:02,671 --> 02:35:07,620
which chose the new group of officers
of rank approved him unanimously.

2515
02:35:07,830 --> 02:35:11,520
In July of 1954, he was sent to
Camp Lajune to lead second division.

2516
02:35:11,521 --> 02:35:15,210
His first major piece time troop command.

2517
02:35:19,400 --> 02:35:20,233
MMM.

2518
02:35:21,360 --> 02:35:22,440
There was a little,
uh,

2519
02:35:22,441 --> 02:35:27,240
an incident health issue and one of
the guys called up Virginia polar,

2520
02:35:27,690 --> 02:35:30,960
his wife and said, brace yourself.
We've taken Lewis to the hospital.

2521
02:35:31,440 --> 02:35:33,750
They can't say what's wrong.
He looks pretty sick

2522
02:35:35,730 --> 02:35:39,540
and
he basically,

2523
02:35:40,440 --> 02:35:44,280
he gets pretty sick.
He kind of recovers from it.

2524
02:35:44,880 --> 02:35:48,480
But the, like I said,
this guy made enemies.

2525
02:35:49,440 --> 02:35:51,660
So here we go back to the book
and this is polar talking.

2526
02:35:51,900 --> 02:35:56,250
I could see then what the game was. They
were going to retire me despite all the,

2527
02:35:56,790 --> 02:35:59,670
all the doctors had said
back at lunch at noon,

2528
02:36:00,030 --> 02:36:02,190
they'd pulled me up to
Washington to get rid of me.

2529
02:36:02,760 --> 02:36:06,030
I didn't mind retiring all that much,
but the way they did it made me sore.

2530
02:36:06,300 --> 02:36:09,840
I had all the service and
honors I needed or wanted,

2531
02:36:09,990 --> 02:36:12,660
I'd come all the way from
private to major general,

2532
02:36:12,750 --> 02:36:14,970
but I was boiling mad about this thing.

2533
02:36:15,240 --> 02:36:18,960
I saw lots of officers around
Washington in poor condition than I was,

2534
02:36:19,050 --> 02:36:20,520
but that wasn't going to matter.

2535
02:36:21,630 --> 02:36:25,260
He remained in the hospital and the
Festa for about two weeks after many

2536
02:36:25,261 --> 02:36:28,950
consultations,
the doctors found him unfit for duty.

2537
02:36:30,390 --> 02:36:34,590
He wrote his wife daily from his room
on the 16th floor, please do not worry.

2538
02:36:34,650 --> 02:36:36,690
We must take things as they come in life.

2539
02:36:37,620 --> 02:36:41,010
There doesn't seem much we
can do to change events.

2540
02:36:43,080 --> 02:36:46,360
So yeah, just to tell that story
a little more. He had like a,

2541
02:36:46,410 --> 02:36:47,520
some kind of health as it was,

2542
02:36:47,670 --> 02:36:50,040
I don't know what it was and they
didn't really seem to know what it was,

2543
02:36:50,130 --> 02:36:53,430
but then he kind of recovered from it
and he back in his job and then they

2544
02:36:53,431 --> 02:36:58,230
pulled them up to Bethesda and to give
them a bunch of screenings and tests and

2545
02:36:58,231 --> 02:37:02,460
see if he was fit for duty and they
found that he was unfit for duty.

2546
02:37:03,330 --> 02:37:06,630
So that's it. That's how it ended.
That's how his career ended.

2547
02:37:07,020 --> 02:37:08,460
A day or so before he went out.

2548
02:37:08,461 --> 02:37:12,180
There was a party in the noncommissioned
officers' club on polar had declined an

2549
02:37:12,181 --> 02:37:16,220
offer from the officer's club,
but he could not turn the enlisted men.

2550
02:37:16,810 --> 02:37:19,850
It began as an intimate party,
but when polar arrived,

2551
02:37:20,570 --> 02:37:24,020
he found a crowd of more than
5,000 who'd come to say goodbye.

2552
02:37:24,680 --> 02:37:29,120
20 pigs were barbecued and there was
feasting and drinking until late in the

2553
02:37:29,120 --> 02:37:29,330
night.

2554
02:37:29,330 --> 02:37:34,330
The general made one of his shirt burst
talks when they shouted for him and

2555
02:37:37,190 --> 02:37:41,840
Sergeant Orval Jones remembered
it. He said, only men,

2556
02:37:41,841 --> 02:37:46,550
I'd rather be toting a rifle and a rear
rank than going out now as lieutenant

2557
02:37:46,551 --> 02:37:50,180
general. Now if you're a
marine, you're all marine.

2558
02:37:50,840 --> 02:37:54,050
You'll put the core above your family,
your country,

2559
02:37:54,170 --> 02:37:55,970
even God and all else.

2560
02:37:55,971 --> 02:37:59,630
In some cases you stick to your core.

2561
02:38:01,310 --> 02:38:02,143
God bless you.

2562
02:38:07,090 --> 02:38:09,010
Polar had broken tradition to the last.

2563
02:38:09,011 --> 02:38:12,910
It was unwritten regulation
that the senior marine
officer on the post would pin

2564
02:38:12,911 --> 02:38:15,460
polars third star on his
shoulder as he retired,

2565
02:38:16,360 --> 02:38:18,670
but polar had called for Bob Norris,

2566
02:38:18,671 --> 02:38:23,320
the senior noncommissioned officer and
the oldest man available who had served

2567
02:38:23,321 --> 02:38:24,154
with him.

2568
02:38:26,820 --> 02:38:30,660
The reporter who followed him got a
formal statement and having sergeant major

2569
02:38:30,661 --> 02:38:33,390
norish attach my third
star at my retirement.

2570
02:38:33,600 --> 02:38:37,980
I wanted to show my great admiration
and appreciation to the enlisted men and

2571
02:38:37,981 --> 02:38:40,050
junior officers of the Marine Corps.

2572
02:38:40,980 --> 02:38:44,100
I fully realize that without
the help of the enlisted men,

2573
02:38:44,250 --> 02:38:46,860
I'd never have risen from
private to lieutenant general.

2574
02:38:48,050 --> 02:38:52,010
I've commanded to everything from a squad
to a division and without the help of

2575
02:38:52,011 --> 02:38:53,690
men and junior officers,

2576
02:38:53,840 --> 02:38:57,380
these units would never have gone forward
and achieve their objective regardless

2577
02:38:57,381 --> 02:38:58,880
of almost certain death.

2578
02:39:00,320 --> 02:39:03,650
My only regret is that things now are,

2579
02:39:04,310 --> 02:39:09,310
I will not be present for the next or
I also want to express my regret at the

2580
02:39:09,981 --> 02:39:14,240
deaths of many hundreds of marines
and the crippling and maiming of other

2581
02:39:14,241 --> 02:39:16,730
hundreds who followed
me blindly into battle.

2582
02:39:18,770 --> 02:39:19,603
Again,

2583
02:39:20,480 --> 02:39:24,170
I would like to thank all marines
for their feelings toward me.

2584
02:39:26,760 --> 02:39:31,440
Louis polar went home to Virginia.
It was just 37 years,

2585
02:39:31,441 --> 02:39:35,550
four months and two days since he had
boarded the train in South Carolina for

2586
02:39:35,551 --> 02:39:40,551
South Carolina to exchange the uniform
of a Vmi Cadet for that of a Marine Corps

2587
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:42,833
boot.

2588
02:39:43,980 --> 02:39:47,730
But his career with the
Marines wasn't quite over.

2589
02:39:49,050 --> 02:39:49,651
Back to the book.

2590
02:39:49,651 --> 02:39:54,651
On a dimly lit night of April 8th,

2591
02:39:55,560 --> 02:39:58,380
1956 a platoon of marine recruits
at Parris Island, South Carolina,

2592
02:39:58,560 --> 02:40:03,210
was marched into a title arm of broad
river by 31 year old veteran drill

2593
02:40:03,211 --> 02:40:06,960
instructor,
Staff Sergeant Matthew c McCune.

2594
02:40:08,720 --> 02:40:11,780
Six recruits drowned.
The commandant,

2595
02:40:12,680 --> 02:40:17,610
General Randolph Mccall Pate immediately
relieved the commanding officer of the

2596
02:40:17,611 --> 02:40:22,611
recruit depot and told
Congress that McCune would be
punished to the full extent

2597
02:40:23,041 --> 02:40:25,800
allowed by our uniform
code of military justice.

2598
02:40:25,950 --> 02:40:30,510
There was a nationwide outcry from
the press pulpit and scores of civic

2599
02:40:30,511 --> 02:40:35,070
organizations. A court inquired choir.
He descended upon Parris Island.

2600
02:40:35,100 --> 02:40:40,100
Mccune became a national
cause to celebrate a sailed
by prohibit prohibitionists

2601
02:40:42,270 --> 02:40:46,080
as a brutal drunkard,
as a symbol of military tyranny,

2602
02:40:46,081 --> 02:40:50,190
which must be destroyed as a
racist bigot. Near Do. Well,

2603
02:40:50,850 --> 02:40:54,330
there were cries for harsh punishment,
even execution.

2604
02:40:56,670 --> 02:40:57,360
Okay.

2605
02:40:57,360 --> 02:41:01,560
Now he ends up going to
trial and for this trial,

2606
02:41:02,520 --> 02:41:06,690
the defense brings in
chesty puller per we know,

2607
02:41:06,691 --> 02:41:07,770
believes in hard training.

2608
02:41:09,570 --> 02:41:13,380
And here we go.
This is a court scene.

2609
02:41:14,440 --> 02:41:15,150
Berman,

2610
02:41:15,150 --> 02:41:18,870
who's the lawyer use the general like a
master showman that offense desires to

2611
02:41:18,871 --> 02:41:21,480
call to the stand.
A lieutenant general polar.

2612
02:41:23,780 --> 02:41:24,613
Okay.

2613
02:41:24,710 --> 02:41:28,370
Seven years. One of the lawyers, sir.
How do you know the accused polar?

2614
02:41:28,610 --> 02:41:32,270
I don't know him except by his pictures
in the newspapers and what I've read

2615
02:41:32,271 --> 02:41:35,060
about him than Berman
took over in question.

2616
02:41:35,061 --> 02:41:38,420
The general about his career as a Marine
Berman. How long were you in Korea?

2617
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:44,690
Polar? About nine months.
Berman, were you in combat?

2618
02:41:44,930 --> 02:41:48,770
Yeah. Where you decorated? Yeah.
Without going into any other,

2619
02:41:48,950 --> 02:41:50,420
any of your other decorations,

2620
02:41:50,540 --> 02:41:54,080
isn't it true that you've received
five Navy crosses? Correct.

2621
02:41:55,470 --> 02:41:55,890
Okay.

2622
02:41:55,890 --> 02:41:59,340
Berman asked his opinion of
the Marine Corps' mission.

2623
02:41:59,640 --> 02:42:02,820
The definition of military
training is success in battle.

2624
02:42:03,900 --> 02:42:04,180
Okay.

2625
02:42:04,180 --> 02:42:07,450
In my opinion, that is the only
objective of military training.

2626
02:42:07,630 --> 02:42:10,930
It wouldn't make any sense to have a
military organization on the backs of the

2627
02:42:10,931 --> 02:42:13,540
American taxpayers with
any other definition.

2628
02:42:13,810 --> 02:42:16,120
I believe that ever since
I was been a marine.

2629
02:42:17,520 --> 02:42:18,280
Okay.

2630
02:42:18,280 --> 02:42:21,910
What is the most important element of
that training? I'll quote Napoleon.

2631
02:42:22,570 --> 02:42:26,440
He stated that the most important thing
in military training is disciplined

2632
02:42:27,280 --> 02:42:30,010
without discipline and army becomes a mob.

2633
02:42:31,120 --> 02:42:31,820
Okay.

2634
02:42:31,820 --> 02:42:33,620
Now then in that context,

2635
02:42:33,710 --> 02:42:37,040
can you tell us whether you have an
opinion based on your experience as to

2636
02:42:37,041 --> 02:42:40,820
whether or not the training and discipline
is for all situations confined to

2637
02:42:40,821 --> 02:42:45,200
lesson plan or syllabi or
training regulations? No.

2638
02:42:46,190 --> 02:42:50,780
The training of a basic
marine is conducted almost
entirely outside in the field

2639
02:42:50,781 --> 02:42:53,930
on the drill ground, on the
rifle range, that kind of work.

2640
02:42:54,740 --> 02:42:58,820
The marine gets an idea of how the
Marine Corps run during this training,

2641
02:42:59,090 --> 02:43:01,100
but it's training is outside work.

2642
02:43:02,500 --> 02:43:02,860
Yeah.

2643
02:43:02,860 --> 02:43:07,620
Can you tell us general of the things
you learned here as a recruit? Well,

2644
02:43:07,621 --> 02:43:11,740
the main thing that I've remembered all
my life is the definition of a spree

2645
02:43:11,741 --> 02:43:14,530
decor. Now, my definition,

2646
02:43:14,620 --> 02:43:19,060
the definition I was taught that have
always believed in is that a spree decor

2647
02:43:19,150 --> 02:43:23,470
means love for one's military legion. In
my case, the United States Marine Corps.

2648
02:43:23,620 --> 02:43:28,620
I also learned that this loyalty to one's
corps travels both ways up and down,

2649
02:43:33,280 --> 02:43:38,280
and he continued through this trial and
that night he went to the enlisted man's

2650
02:43:44,381 --> 02:43:49,381
club and big crowd of course was there
and they start shouting and yelling for

2651
02:43:51,521 --> 02:43:54,700
him to speak and finally he stands up
and says, I've talked enough for today.

2652
02:43:54,840 --> 02:43:57,490
This will be my last request.
Do your duty.

2653
02:43:57,640 --> 02:44:02,640
And the Marine Corps will be as great as
it has always been for another thousand

2654
02:44:03,370 --> 02:44:04,203
years.

2655
02:44:04,420 --> 02:44:04,910
Yeah,

2656
02:44:04,910 --> 02:44:06,200
the applause was deafening.

2657
02:44:10,960 --> 02:44:11,460
Okay.

2658
02:44:11,460 --> 02:44:16,290
Went back to his hometown of Saluda
and he was not forgotten there.

2659
02:44:17,730 --> 02:44:21,470
There he was getting interviewed
by a graduate student

2660
02:44:23,510 --> 02:44:26,450
who is trying to learn about
psychology and the general said,

2661
02:44:26,451 --> 02:44:27,950
I've never studied psychology.

2662
02:44:28,190 --> 02:44:31,370
I had only one year of college and
always thought I would go back,

2663
02:44:31,371 --> 02:44:32,750
but enlisted instead.

2664
02:44:33,890 --> 02:44:37,490
I think the Marine Corps is the
best place to learn the art of war

2665
02:44:40,160 --> 02:44:43,030
and then again, this
reflects back, you know,

2666
02:44:43,070 --> 02:44:47,720
people now say that America is getting
soft and the youth are so they're saying

2667
02:44:47,721 --> 02:44:48,554
the same thing.

2668
02:44:48,560 --> 02:44:53,560
Everything's going bad and that they
have a panel of experts to deal with the

2669
02:44:55,521 --> 02:45:00,500
decline of the nation and it's a
rising tide of juvenile delinquency.

2670
02:45:01,520 --> 02:45:02,360
The consensus,

2671
02:45:02,390 --> 02:45:05,330
the consensus was that the country
was going to hell in a hand bucket.

2672
02:45:06,680 --> 02:45:10,310
General polar while this big meeting
is going on, general polar stood

2673
02:45:11,840 --> 02:45:16,840
and intended in his intended mildness
of tone as usual came forth as a brazen

2674
02:45:17,301 --> 02:45:19,160
war.
I want you people to know something.

2675
02:45:19,310 --> 02:45:21,950
As long as we can get some
decent leadership in our country,

2676
02:45:22,040 --> 02:45:25,520
our youth of today will be better men
than their fathers or grandfathers.

2677
02:45:26,300 --> 02:45:30,560
I saw enough in Korea to make sure that
our forefathers at valley forge have

2678
02:45:30,561 --> 02:45:33,860
been mentioned here tonight
as they often are. Well,

2679
02:45:33,861 --> 02:45:37,460
I can tell you that valley forge was
something like a picnic compared to what

2680
02:45:37,461 --> 02:45:41,450
your younger Americans went through at
the chosen reservoir and they came out of

2681
02:45:41,451 --> 02:45:42,284
it fine.

2682
02:45:43,040 --> 02:45:47,300
It was never anything like 25
below zero at valley forge either.

2683
02:45:47,540 --> 02:45:50,720
I admit, we don't seem to have
the proper leadership at the top,

2684
02:45:50,721 --> 02:45:52,610
but there's nothing wrong
with the kids today.

2685
02:45:53,960 --> 02:45:57,560
My wife and I follow the ideas
my mother used on her kids,

2686
02:45:57,710 --> 02:46:00,320
making them study each night after this,
after supper,

2687
02:46:01,010 --> 02:46:05,150
and when they report that they have
mastered their lessons, quizzing them,

2688
02:46:06,410 --> 02:46:10,340
our children don't need to be
coddled and shouldn't be condemned.

2689
02:46:10,910 --> 02:46:13,010
Above all,
for Heaven Sakes,

2690
02:46:13,910 --> 02:46:16,970
let your son's alone and
let them grow up to be men.

2691
02:46:21,630 --> 02:46:22,470
It's interesting that

2692
02:46:24,060 --> 02:46:27,090
I would say that still
applies in very many ways.

2693
02:46:30,250 --> 02:46:35,250
He also had people visiting him all the
time and asking him questions and he

2694
02:46:37,781 --> 02:46:42,070
was, again, he remained speak, you
know, uh, uh, an outspoken guy.

2695
02:46:42,250 --> 02:46:45,550
I'm afraid we haven't recognized the
most important lesson from Korea.

2696
02:46:45,880 --> 02:46:49,450
The communists have developed a
totally new kind of warfare, uh,

2697
02:46:49,451 --> 02:46:54,340
warfare of whole peoples. And under
that no modern nation can be conquered.

2698
02:46:54,550 --> 02:46:58,750
We saw something like that in China when
Japan was nibbling away at the mainland.

2699
02:46:58,930 --> 02:47:03,220
The Japanese controlled only a square
yard where a soldier stood and nothing

2700
02:47:03,221 --> 02:47:06,940
beyond that. In Korea,
the reds improved on that.

2701
02:47:07,150 --> 02:47:08,620
This is total warfare,

2702
02:47:09,010 --> 02:47:13,390
yet small in scope and it's designed
to neutralize our big nuclear weapons.

2703
02:47:14,140 --> 02:47:17,740
Look at Vietnam. The French
outnumbered the communist two to one.

2704
02:47:17,920 --> 02:47:21,850
Yet they were massacred.
If we don't design some way to meet this,

2705
02:47:21,970 --> 02:47:23,350
they'll whip us in the end.

2706
02:47:23,530 --> 02:47:26,900
Don't forget that regular armies
of never fared well in red,

2707
02:47:26,950 --> 02:47:31,240
irregular warfare and that
lesson was old when Rome fell.

2708
02:47:31,900 --> 02:47:35,320
It's amazing that he's saying this.
It's just, it's just a mandate. We do.

2709
02:47:35,330 --> 02:47:36,940
You know the French had been beat.
We hadn't eat,

2710
02:47:36,970 --> 02:47:38,980
I don't think we're even in Vietnam yet.
In fact,

2711
02:47:38,981 --> 02:47:41,350
we weren't Vietnam yet when this,
when he's making these statements,

2712
02:47:43,500 --> 02:47:44,670
we didn't pay attention to it.

2713
02:47:49,020 --> 02:47:52,380
Finally,
he goes to a,

2714
02:47:52,860 --> 02:47:57,860
and there was some kind of a rift
between him and the First Marine Division

2715
02:47:58,081 --> 02:48:03,081
Association and they sorted out that
rift and he went to a big reunion of the

2716
02:48:05,460 --> 02:48:07,620
Marine Corps,
the First Marine Division Association,

2717
02:48:08,010 --> 02:48:11,370
back to the Book General Smith blinked
against the spotlight and turn to the

2718
02:48:11,371 --> 02:48:13,410
blackness.
At the far end of the table.

2719
02:48:13,411 --> 02:48:17,630
I now give you chesty and they'll rare.

2720
02:48:17,670 --> 02:48:20,250
The roar was so loud,

2721
02:48:20,251 --> 02:48:22,710
it drowned out the speaker's
voice and shook the walls.

2722
02:48:22,711 --> 02:48:26,910
The spotlight swung to the last place
at the table to reveal polar in a linen

2723
02:48:26,911 --> 02:48:30,090
suit, waving his hand and
flashing his broad crooked grin.

2724
02:48:31,320 --> 02:48:32,610
As the clamor increased,

2725
02:48:32,790 --> 02:48:36,840
he marched to the microphone and
started a in a bobbing circle of light.

2726
02:48:36,841 --> 02:48:39,630
General Smith shouted to the
tempest of the sound. I see.

2727
02:48:39,631 --> 02:48:41,070
You all know chesty puller.

2728
02:48:42,150 --> 02:48:46,410
Men in the crowd danced among the tables
world each other about and pounded

2729
02:48:46,411 --> 02:48:47,820
their neighbors on the backs.

2730
02:48:47,970 --> 02:48:52,680
Some climbed on their chairs shouting
wordlessly tears streaming on their

2731
02:48:52,681 --> 02:48:53,514
tricks.

2732
02:48:54,390 --> 02:48:59,220
Others hammered the table with cutlery
or embraced women who were staring

2733
02:48:59,221 --> 02:49:00,600
incredulously at polar.

2734
02:49:01,950 --> 02:49:02,740
Okay.

2735
02:49:02,740 --> 02:49:07,150
The men broke into chance. We
want chesty. We want polar.

2736
02:49:08,360 --> 02:49:09,650
They called for a speech,

2737
02:49:09,800 --> 02:49:12,560
but it was almost five minutes
before the howling ceased.

2738
02:49:14,090 --> 02:49:19,090
Polar face them with a wry smile that
looked as if it had been rung from his

2739
02:49:19,341 --> 02:49:23,340
face by force.
When quiet returned,

2740
02:49:23,670 --> 02:49:28,380
he grasped the microphone and called an
an astonishing leap. Penetrating voice.

2741
02:49:28,500 --> 02:49:29,640
Marines.

2742
02:49:31,170 --> 02:49:35,130
Pandemonium broke out once more as if
he had shouted some secret watch word

2743
02:49:35,280 --> 02:49:37,770
whose implications were
known only to these men.

2744
02:49:37,950 --> 02:49:42,540
Half the crowd was still on its feet a
moment later when polar could be heard

2745
02:49:42,541 --> 02:49:43,374
again.

2746
02:49:45,060 --> 02:49:45,550
Okay.

2747
02:49:45,550 --> 02:49:48,490
If you believe the newspapers
and radios and television,

2748
02:49:48,700 --> 02:49:50,680
our country is in a hell of a shape.

2749
02:49:51,670 --> 02:49:52,320
Okay.

2750
02:49:52,320 --> 02:49:57,120
I don't believe it. So long as
we've got the first marine division,

2751
02:49:57,600 --> 02:49:58,740
we'll be okay.

2752
02:50:02,570 --> 02:50:04,710
The crowd shouted him into silence again.

2753
02:50:07,590 --> 02:50:11,730
He was tired when he got home
to Saluda and that evening,

2754
02:50:11,940 --> 02:50:16,590
Virginia polar found him pensive
and distractive, distracted.

2755
02:50:18,210 --> 02:50:23,210
They sat on the screened porch looking
out into the Virginia dusk lit by

2756
02:50:23,791 --> 02:50:27,170
fireflies.
Louis,

2757
02:50:28,100 --> 02:50:31,130
is there anything you'd wish
for now that it's all over?

2758
02:50:34,940 --> 02:50:39,620
Well, he said I'd like to do it
all over again. The whole thing.

2759
02:50:41,600 --> 02:50:44,900
She side
more than that,

2760
02:50:45,680 --> 02:50:46,610
more than anything.

2761
02:50:53,160 --> 02:50:58,160
I'd like to see the face once again
of every marine I've ever served with,

2762
02:51:09,990 --> 02:51:10,823
and that

2763
02:51:13,190 --> 02:51:14,690
is where this book ends.

2764
02:51:17,030 --> 02:51:22,030
But that is not where
this story ends because

2765
02:51:25,880 --> 02:51:28,430
as I mentioned then as the book mentioned,

2766
02:51:29,970 --> 02:51:31,200
Chesty Puller had a son.

2767
02:51:32,660 --> 02:51:33,050
Okay.

2768
02:51:33,050 --> 02:51:38,050
And his son also became
a Marine Corp officer,

2769
02:51:38,360 --> 02:51:43,280
but his son's experience in the Marine
Corps in combat and in life was very

2770
02:51:43,281 --> 02:51:46,070
different from his father's

2771
02:51:49,590 --> 02:51:51,960
good.
I will tell that story

2772
02:51:53,460 --> 02:51:54,600
in the next episode,

2773
02:51:55,440 --> 02:52:00,440
number 122 which is available now
so you can listen to it immediately

2774
02:52:05,500 --> 02:52:06,130
because these

2775
02:52:06,130 --> 02:52:07,600
stories are linked

2776
02:52:09,420 --> 02:52:14,420
and so we are linking them
in this series of podcasts.

2777
02:52:16,760 --> 02:52:17,680
And in the meantime,

2778
02:52:20,320 --> 02:52:24,400
before you listened to that Echo,
if somebody wants to support this podcast,

2779
02:52:24,401 --> 02:52:28,760
can you briefly tell us how
we can do it? Yes. Okay.

2780
02:52:29,290 --> 02:52:34,210
Briefly we'll talk about the store Jocko
store. That is where you can get this.

2781
02:52:34,211 --> 02:52:38,050
Blink was freedom shirts,
hats,

2782
02:52:38,980 --> 02:52:43,980
some rash guards on their hoodies
and beanies are on the way.

2783
02:52:44,710 --> 02:52:49,150
Promise, um, if not already, uh, just,
you know, check on that Jocko, store.com.

2784
02:52:49,151 --> 02:52:53,920
There's a lot of good stuff on there for
women and also kid stuff where your kid

2785
02:52:53,921 --> 02:52:58,330
stuff.
Also when you get the book

2786
02:53:00,220 --> 02:53:02,920
marine life of Chesty Puller a,

2787
02:53:02,921 --> 02:53:05,620
I'm going to list it on the website
in the book section, it's on the top.

2788
02:53:05,621 --> 02:53:06,131
You Click there,

2789
02:53:06,131 --> 02:53:09,790
it says books from episodes and I'll
have them all listed by episode.

2790
02:53:11,040 --> 02:53:12,720
Click through that good way to support,
uh,

2791
02:53:12,730 --> 02:53:15,370
it take you to Amazon and you get
your book and get whatever else you're

2792
02:53:15,371 --> 02:53:17,230
shopping for.
Also,

2793
02:53:19,640 --> 02:53:24,280
go to origin main.com. This is where you
can get your g if you're doing Jujitsu.

2794
02:53:25,690 --> 02:53:29,230
When you do Jujitsu is where you
can get you all made in America.

2795
02:53:29,500 --> 02:53:31,570
There's also rash guards on there and

2796
02:53:33,550 --> 02:53:38,380
there's some hoodies and sweatpants
and stuff on there. Very comfortable.

2797
02:53:38,650 --> 02:53:42,280
Uh, I went over that before.
But um, nonetheless, go there.

2798
02:53:43,620 --> 02:53:47,740
[inaudible] dot com also
or did you mean.com still?

2799
02:53:47,741 --> 02:53:52,030
You can get Tacos,
supplements. We have milk.

2800
02:53:52,120 --> 02:53:56,160
That's the new one. Is that available
yet? Yes. Boom. There you go. Well,

2801
02:53:56,230 --> 02:54:01,210
protein powder, mint chocolate
chip. That's the good one.

2802
02:54:01,270 --> 02:54:05,110
Tastes good too.
What else tastes good is Jocko discipline,

2803
02:54:05,710 --> 02:54:10,570
which is a nootropic
pre mission supplement.

2804
02:54:11,080 --> 02:54:14,860
Good. Little bit of caffeine in there. Not
Too much a little bit, but for, you know,

2805
02:54:15,460 --> 02:54:16,810
it has the physical,

2806
02:54:16,840 --> 02:54:21,790
a supplementation benefits and the
cognitive supplemental benefits.

2807
02:54:21,950 --> 02:54:26,050
So get down called discipline. Also
joint warfare. And krill oil, Jocko,

2808
02:54:26,051 --> 02:54:30,330
Super Krill oil. These supplements are for
your joints. Don't neglect your joints.

2809
02:54:30,570 --> 02:54:34,840
It's a big deal.
You can be able to lift 500 pounds,

2810
02:54:35,950 --> 02:54:37,750
but if your elbows are jacked up,

2811
02:54:37,910 --> 02:54:39,910
you're not going to be up
to lift that 500 pounds.

2812
02:54:40,060 --> 02:54:41,440
Maybe you get a warm up a bunch,

2813
02:54:41,500 --> 02:54:45,250
but I know it'll mess you up if you're
going to mess up. It's a big deal. Anyway,

2814
02:54:45,280 --> 02:54:46,030
take her joints.

2815
02:54:46,030 --> 02:54:50,680
Super Krill and joint warfare
all made America. By the way.

2816
02:54:51,010 --> 02:54:53,440
Everything in origin mean made in America.

2817
02:54:53,690 --> 02:54:57,580
Also for fitness gear like kettle bells,
the cool ones.

2818
02:54:57,581 --> 02:54:58,990
I get primal bells.

2819
02:54:59,920 --> 02:55:04,310
It's actually a lot of good stuff
on on it.com go slash Jocko.

2820
02:55:04,311 --> 02:55:07,460
Good way to support good
workout gear on there. Also,

2821
02:55:10,830 --> 02:55:15,170
if you want Jocko white tea,
I'm going to put that in the store.

2822
02:55:15,170 --> 02:55:17,960
I think make it easy,
but it's everywhere.

2823
02:55:18,110 --> 02:55:22,220
Jocko white tea you can get on Jocko,
store.com I'll put down there soon.

2824
02:55:22,310 --> 02:55:25,670
If not right now,
Amazon of course,

2825
02:55:26,960 --> 02:55:31,960
and you can go to Jocko t.com
that's kind of the main hub.

2826
02:55:33,500 --> 02:55:35,600
And then so if you're shopping
international, it'll direct,

2827
02:55:35,870 --> 02:55:37,190
direct you to where you can get it.

2828
02:55:37,580 --> 02:55:40,340
I think that's what I'm putting in the
store so we can ship it to Canada and

2829
02:55:40,341 --> 02:55:43,620
stuff. There was a whole thing. Anyway,
I'm gonna make it easy. Um, yeah,

2830
02:55:43,621 --> 02:55:48,350
so actually go to [inaudible] dot com
that'll direct you to where ever you,

2831
02:55:48,360 --> 02:55:53,000
you are in however you, however you want
to get it. Also subscribe to the podcast.

2832
02:55:53,030 --> 02:55:56,330
If you haven't already on
iTunes, stitcher, Google, play,

2833
02:55:57,900 --> 02:56:02,610
Spotify, wherever, wherever
they have a podcast.

2834
02:56:02,790 --> 02:56:07,560
Subscribe. Good way to support also
youtube video version of this podcast.

2835
02:56:07,590 --> 02:56:09,030
Also excerpts,

2836
02:56:10,020 --> 02:56:15,020
little lessons kind of just taken from
each episode and enhanced excerpts.

2837
02:56:15,090 --> 02:56:19,030
If you're, if you're really into
feeling the message, just doctor,

2838
02:56:19,040 --> 02:56:22,560
her mom was the music or something
like that. Also, psychological warfare.

2839
02:56:24,450 --> 02:56:25,350
If you don't know what that is,

2840
02:56:25,380 --> 02:56:29,940
it's an album with tracks Jocko
telling you pragmatic advice,

2841
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:35,000
how to get through moments of weakness
in your campaign against weakness.

2842
02:56:35,131 --> 02:56:35,821
Like workouts.

2843
02:56:35,821 --> 02:56:39,960
Like if you want to skip the workout
or you want to slip on the day just a

2844
02:56:39,961 --> 02:56:42,940
little bit, just refer to one of the
tracks in there. Jack would tell you,

2845
02:56:43,300 --> 02:56:44,550
you know,
hold the line

2846
02:56:44,710 --> 02:56:47,410
as they say,
check and you know,

2847
02:56:47,411 --> 02:56:51,220
speaking of subscribe and subscribing,

2848
02:56:51,640 --> 02:56:56,320
we have a new podcast out and it's,
it's actually separate from this podcast.

2849
02:56:56,980 --> 02:57:01,570
The new podcast is called the war.
Your kid podcast, ask Uncle Jake.

2850
02:57:01,660 --> 02:57:05,710
Like I said, it's a separate channel, so
you have to subscribe to it separately.

2851
02:57:05,950 --> 02:57:09,610
I did that because as you know
from listening to this podcast,

2852
02:57:10,660 --> 02:57:15,660
there's some podcasts that are for very
mature audiences and you wouldn't want

2853
02:57:15,761 --> 02:57:20,200
to have your kid listening to
that, you know, a kid podcast.

2854
02:57:20,201 --> 02:57:24,310
Then all of a sudden a very
violent podcast comes on.

2855
02:57:24,460 --> 02:57:25,870
So we separated them,

2856
02:57:26,350 --> 02:57:29,680
the warrior kid podcast
questions for Uncle Jake and

2857
02:57:31,400 --> 02:57:32,160
yeah,

2858
02:57:32,160 --> 02:57:36,130
I think uncle Jake has lessons for
everyone regardless of age. Yeah.

2859
02:57:37,160 --> 02:57:37,830
You know,

2860
02:57:37,830 --> 02:57:41,580
I think teachers and parents and big time
would want to listen to that as well.

2861
02:57:41,680 --> 02:57:43,680
Yeah, we've got some great
feedback so far on it.

2862
02:57:43,710 --> 02:57:48,090
So that's called the warrior kid podcast.
And on top of that, there's a new war.

2863
02:57:48,091 --> 02:57:52,140
Your kid book, it's called Mark's
mission. If you actually want it,

2864
02:57:52,980 --> 02:57:57,690
you should order it now through whatever
channel you want to order it from.

2865
02:57:57,960 --> 02:58:01,770
Go to your local bookstore,
go to Amazon, go to and noble,

2866
02:58:01,860 --> 02:58:06,750
order it so that you have it when it
comes out so that the publisher knows how

2867
02:58:06,751 --> 02:58:09,960
many to make because otherwise the
publisher thinks, oh well we'll,

2868
02:58:09,961 --> 02:58:12,120
we won't make that many of them because
there's not that many people that you

2869
02:58:12,121 --> 02:58:15,150
know are going to buy this. They're wrong
because you all are going to buy this.

2870
02:58:16,170 --> 02:58:18,450
So if they don't know that
they don't make enough,

2871
02:58:18,660 --> 02:58:22,590
it takes too long to get it once
it comes out. So order it now.

2872
02:58:23,670 --> 02:58:25,740
Other books you can order.
Extreme ownership,

2873
02:58:28,090 --> 02:58:32,020
combat leadership for business and life
discipline equals freedom field manual.

2874
02:58:32,260 --> 02:58:36,880
It's about getting after it and actually
Leif Babin and I have a new book coming

2875
02:58:36,881 --> 02:58:40,900
out, a follow up to treme ownership.
It's called the dichotomy of leadership.

2876
02:58:41,250 --> 02:58:43,900
It is available for preorder right now.
Same thing.

2877
02:58:43,901 --> 02:58:47,620
Order it now so that you get
your copy when it comes out.

2878
02:58:47,740 --> 02:58:49,240
Otherwise you'll be waiting.

2879
02:58:50,810 --> 02:58:51,110
Okay.

2880
02:58:51,110 --> 02:58:53,090
I have a leadership and
management consulting company.

2881
02:58:53,091 --> 02:58:55,340
It's called Ashkelon Front.
If you want information about that,

2882
02:58:55,341 --> 02:58:58,430
go to Ashkelon front.com
we have the muster,

2883
02:58:58,431 --> 02:59:02,870
which is a leadership conference
coming up. If you want to come to it,

2884
02:59:04,100 --> 02:59:08,900
go to extreme ownership.com and also
if you want to attend the roll call,

2885
02:59:09,170 --> 02:59:12,470
which is for military law
enforcement, firefighters, paramedics,

2886
02:59:12,471 --> 02:59:14,330
other first responders.
If you want to do that,

2887
02:59:15,470 --> 02:59:20,470
you can also sign up for the roll
call@extremeownership.com and with that,

2888
02:59:21,380 --> 02:59:24,830
as I just mentioned,
these podcasts,

2889
02:59:24,920 --> 02:59:29,090
these three podcasts that we're
doing right now are all linked.

2890
02:59:29,180 --> 02:59:34,180
It's one big story with a thread running
through it and we are releasing them

2891
02:59:37,401 --> 02:59:38,330
all at the same time.

2892
02:59:38,720 --> 02:59:43,720
So the next one will be one 22 and one
23 go ahead and and go listen to them

2893
02:59:46,521 --> 02:59:49,230
right now.
And until then,

2894
02:59:50,160 --> 02:59:52,890
this is echo and Jocko out.
