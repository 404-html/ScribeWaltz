00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,450
This is Jocko podcast number
29 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,380
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,190
Okay.

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:17,190
Into the midst of this war torn land
were inserted 22 able bodied American

5
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:21,310
soldiers and the platoon leader.

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,780
As I made my way to the platoon command
post c p the sun had already dropped

7
00:00:28,181 --> 00:00:33,181
from the sky night in the tropics
comes fast and even as I approached the

8
00:00:33,221 --> 00:00:34,750
outgoing platoon leader,

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,440
the shadows had begun to
obscure his facial features.

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,400
I found him lying on his
stomach in a depression,

11
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,980
situated roughly in the
center of the platoon.

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,930
As I bent over to introduce myself,
he motioned for me to get down,

13
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,840
assuming that perhaps I was dangerously
exposed. I laid down next to him.

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,380
Hello, I'm Jim Mcdonough. I said,

15
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,900
feeling somewhat awkward,

16
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:08,820
being so formal while lying on my stomach.
Tom Rolf,

17
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,520
he said,
are you here to take my place?

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,550
He was unable to conceal his
eagerness. Yes, I replied,

19
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:22,800
can you tell me what's going on here?
As he began briefing me,

20
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:27,801
it became apparent that the platoon
was not the object of his thoughts.

21
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,350
I asked questions about the
disposition of the squads,

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,020
the personalities of the men,
the tactics of the enemy,

23
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,760
the attitude of the villagers.

24
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,320
He responded by telling me
about how difficult the job was,

25
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,640
how much his family needed him, how he
never asked to be an infantry lieutenant,

26
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,550
how dangerous,

27
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:50,310
not an honorable his life had been of
late and how he did not deserve to be

28
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:51,510
wounded or killed.

29
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,470
Yeah.

30
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,370
He was overcome by fear that
on his last night in the field,

31
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,760
the enemy would somehow
snatch survival away from him.

32
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,710
As the hours passed,
we did not move from our position.

33
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,000
In the midst of the platoon.

34
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,920
I became acutely conscious
of our protected posture,

35
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,430
all about us.
I could hear movement.

36
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,110
I saw silhouettes of soldiers as they
moved about setting up their positions for

37
00:02:20,111 --> 00:02:24,820
the night. I noted that at least one
patrol departed from the perimeter,

38
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,600
but that the orders for the patrol
did not come from the Lieutenant

39
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,011
Ralph lay.

40
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:35,800
They're chattering aimlessly into the
night describing again and again for me,

41
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,500
the wife and two children
he had left behind.

42
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,290
Okay.

43
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,440
Gradually he honed in on his point.

44
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,660
You've got to understand, I did
this for them. They need me.

45
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,430
They need me in one piece,

46
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,770
nervous silence followed as I tried
to find his eyes in the darkness.

47
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,760
What was he talking about?
The question or rose.

48
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,140
Even as the answer was forming all
around me, they know what to do.

49
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,950
They're good soldiers.
Silence again.

50
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,310
He was shocked by his own confession,

51
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,750
but at the same time he was urged
on by the bearing of his soul.

52
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,400
I could have been a hero
sometimes I even wanted to be,

53
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,280
but I had to think of my
family. You See, don't you?

54
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,150
Most of these men don't have
any family there. Just boys.

55
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,230
The shamefulness of his
words hit me like a club.

56
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,090
He was not the leader of this platoon.
He felt no responsibility for the mission.

57
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,780
He fell no compassion for his men.
In his mind.

58
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:48,781
The other members of the platoon existed
for only one reason to protect him,

59
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:54,400
to keep him alive. They
were expendable. He was not.

60
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,630
He had reason to live.
They did not

61
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:00,600
okay.

62
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,040
I wanted to crawl away, but it was
dark and I had no idea where to go.

63
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:09,060
We stopped talking.
I had nothing more to ask.

64
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,590
He wanted to say more about
his personal concerns.

65
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,230
He knew he had gone too
far but he didn't care.

66
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,040
His only concern in the world was to
leave that knoll as soon as possible.

67
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,810
The platoon and I could
be damned if he survived.

68
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,850
Justice would have been done that night.
Nothing else mattered for him.

69
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:35,280
His soul lay naked, stripped
of pride, guilt and shame.

70
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,880
They were affections of the
civilized world out here,

71
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,070
only living mattered,
unable to sleep,

72
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,450
unable to move.

73
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,480
I lay there wondering which I would turn
out to be the crazed killer I had met

74
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:59,600
and Q non with a blatant
coward beside me in the dark,

75
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,460
which one was more devoid of humanity.
I did not know.

76
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,470
Later after almost three months
in the field, I saw a for again

77
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,440
at the battalion secure behind the
battalion perimeter of Lz north English.

78
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,460
He had adopted an air of bravado
and the safety of the officers club.

79
00:05:22,861 --> 00:05:24,960
He told me of his brave deeds,

80
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,800
he taught as one who had
seen it all in his own words,

81
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,570
he became the dashing,
fearless leader of combat infantry men.

82
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:38,610
He even had a few combat awards for valor,

83
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,820
the procurement of which
fell among his duties,

84
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,360
but the most amazing thing
of all was his beliefs.

85
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,480
Belief in every one of his own words as
far as he consciously knew he was all he

86
00:05:55,341 --> 00:06:00,130
claimed to be.
He had forgotten how he laid,

87
00:06:00,131 --> 00:06:04,190
quivering in the dark,
praying for the enemy not to come.

88
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,890
Okay.

89
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:09,940
From that point on,
I began to watch myself carefully.

90
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,780
Was I really what I thought I was or had
I deluded myself as effectively as Raul

91
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,323
Fad.

92
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,670
Okay.

93
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,310
In the morning,
the helicopter came to take Ralph away.

94
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,010
He brought himself to his knees,

95
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:30,780
which is as high as I had seen him rise
since my arrival the night before and

96
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:33,900
without a word of farewell
to me or any of the soldiers,

97
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:36,270
he made a desperate
dash for the helicopter.

98
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,570
Okay.

99
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,261
In an instant,

100
00:06:38,261 --> 00:06:43,261
he was gone and I recognized with a
feeling of awe that I was now in command.

101
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,170
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

102
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,590
Well back in Vietnam the night.

103
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,793
Hmm.

104
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,110
And this book right here
is called platoon leader.

105
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,760
A memoir of command in combat
by James are make Dunno.

106
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,230
He served,
he went to West Point,

107
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:23,330
so four years at west point and then
he got assigned to the hundred 73rd

108
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,560
airborne brigade in Vietnam.

109
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,570
And one thing about this book,
and this is a

110
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:36,180
a fantastic book and I'll tell you there's
a quote on the back of the book here.

111
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,520
It's the Marine Corps Gazette wrote,

112
00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:43,521
this stands alone is the finest statement
of what it means to be the commander

113
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:45,480
of a small unit.

114
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:51,170
I hope that every platoon leader reads
ponders and truly absorbs the words of

115
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:53,040
Lieutenant Colonel Mcdonald.
Okay.

116
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,323
Okay.

117
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,120
So it starts off there.

118
00:08:01,121 --> 00:08:06,121
That was him going to this
small little perimeter,

119
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:12,520
but platoon perimeter outside
of a village in Vietnam,

120
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,690
he's taking over from the outgoing
platoon commander. And again,

121
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:19,480
this is something very different than
we do in the seal teams where you just

122
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,390
have a random new guy show up,
it's going to take charge.

123
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,430
We're lucky the way we're set up.

124
00:08:24,431 --> 00:08:29,320
We do like an entire workup and prepare
for deployment with the same guys we're

125
00:08:29,321 --> 00:08:32,350
going to be on deployment with and
then we all go on deployment together.

126
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,840
We work together and when and
deployments over we go home.

127
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:39,130
It's a very solid way of running
that system. This is different.

128
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,790
There's guys trickling in and out all
the time throughout the entire chain of

129
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:43,540
command,

130
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:47,770
all the way up from the frontline guys
all the way up to the commander of the

131
00:08:47,771 --> 00:08:48,540
platoon.

132
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,373
Hmm.

133
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,510
Fresh out of west point.
Fresh out of college. Yeah.

134
00:08:57,511 --> 00:09:02,340
It's a military college, but it shows up
in Vietnam. Then here he is in the bush.

135
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,370
Back to the book,
I was alone.

136
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,310
That was my first sensation as a leader.
I gathered up my belongings,

137
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:18,090
my weapon, web gear and rucksack
and move toward the command post.

138
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,320
I needed a few minutes to gather my
thoughts before I made my debut as platoon

139
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:25,320
leader. I knew it was going
to be a tricky business.

140
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,600
I had assumed that I would ever have
a company commander nearby to give me

141
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:35,550
orders, but I had not even met him
yet. I would not meet him for weeks.

142
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:38,280
So that's the guy who was above the
platoon commanders. The company commander,

143
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,160
you know in his mind he thinks is
going to have this company commander or

144
00:09:41,161 --> 00:09:44,220
somewhere nearby him mentoring him and
tell him what to do. Not Happening.

145
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,010
Doesn't have any even hasn't even met him.
He's taken over the platoon.

146
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:51,870
He hasn't even met the company commander
yet. I would not meet him for weeks.

147
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,250
The fact was I was totally on my own.
What should I do?

148
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:01,230
Whose advice could I ask? The platoon
sergeants, the squad leaders in time,

149
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:04,470
I would listen to their ideas,
incorporate them with my own,

150
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:08,730
but I could hardly begin with, well, what
do you think we ought to do? Men? No,

151
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:11,430
I knew that the basic
decisions were mine to make.

152
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,040
Now I might go in that situation a little
bit different and I wouldn't have any

153
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:21,180
problem asking platoon sergeants
and asking squad leaders, hey guys,

154
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:24,480
what's going on? Getting some
feedback from them. What's
been working, what's not?

155
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,810
I don't think there's any, I don't think
there's anything wrong with that at all.

156
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:33,180
He took a little different tact.
He didn't feel comfortable doing that

157
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,371
and you know,

158
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:38,100
one of the reasons why he didn't feel
comfortable doing that because he's young,

159
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,250
he's fresh out of college
and he's a little nervous.

160
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:44,100
Stepping into this combat role.
Obviously

161
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,650
back to the book,
the first few moments would be crucial.

162
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,250
Obviously I was the object
of interest that morning.

163
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,690
Everyone was wondering what the new
tech new lieutenant would be like and I

164
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:02,340
would be telling them with my first
words, my gestures, my demeanor,

165
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:06,150
my eyes.
So he knows that everything he does,

166
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,040
they're watching him
and they're judging him.

167
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:13,320
I would have no grace period in
which to learn my way around.

168
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,360
This was a life and death environment.
If I began with a blunder,

169
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:23,310
my credibility as a leader would be
shot and so might some of the men.

170
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,040
I decided to begin by giving
my attention to tactics.

171
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,050
In a military environment,

172
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,100
everything is determined by tactical
considerations where you sleep,

173
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,620
when you sleep, where you go, what you do,

174
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,590
and in those company you do it

175
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,200
all or dictated by underlying
tactical necessities.

176
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,760
I would communicate my style of leadership
through my tactical instructions.

177
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,130
Pretty good call,
pretty good call.

178
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,960
Let's just talk tactics,
something that we're all familiar with.

179
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,730
The first thing that occurred to me was
the necessity of sending out patrols.

180
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,640
If our actions were strictly defensive,

181
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,790
the enemy would be free
to pick their tactics.

182
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,900
The initiative would be theirs and this
would eventually disprove the illusion

183
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:19,660
of security that the
perimeter wire offered.

184
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,440
My training told me that a completely
defensive unit is a prime target for an

185
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:30,760
overwhelming attack. Boom, so he
knows that out of the gate, again,

186
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:35,110
they've got this nice little perimeter
set up. They've got 30 or so guys there.

187
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,990
They've got to defend this
perimeter from attack,

188
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,140
but instead of just staying in
a defensive position, he's like,

189
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,170
we got to go out on patrol.
We got to get out there.

190
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,790
We've got to disrupt
what the enemy's doing

191
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:52,940
and combat leadership as in real estate.
Location is everything.

192
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:58,040
I was the platoon leader and the
patrolling would be done by squad size

193
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:58,874
elements.

194
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,830
Normally there were 10 men in the squad
and four squads in a rifle platoon

195
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,970
for personnel. Strengths being
what they were. My squad's,

196
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:12,971
we're down to only six or seven men of
peace and there were only three squats.

197
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:18,430
I would be risking over supervision of
the patrolling squad who's direction was

198
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:22,490
better left to the squad leader.
If I went with it,

199
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,110
I would also be away from the majority
of my platoon back at the perimeter.

200
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,490
On the other hand,

201
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,140
to stay with this two squads
in the perimeter would deny
me the knowledge of the

202
00:13:33,141 --> 00:13:38,141
terrain in which the my platoon operated
and the opportunity to evaluate the

203
00:13:38,271 --> 00:13:42,560
quality of the patrols, the
major offensive activity
of my tactical position.

204
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,270
Moreover,

205
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:49,400
I would not be sharing the highest risk
operations of my men and would therefore

206
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,140
might lose their respect.

207
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:55,700
I also might miss my best chance to
appreciate their perceptions, needs,

208
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,610
and attitudes.
Finally,

209
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,060
I might slip into a
defensive attitude myself,

210
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:06,320
and that attitude will eventually
overtake the entire platoon.

211
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,240
So basically there aren't
there inside that perimeter.

212
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,220
He's got three squads and he's sending
the one squad out on patrol on a fairly

213
00:14:16,221 --> 00:14:20,630
regular basis, and he's, the question
is, you know, where should I go?

214
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,500
What should I do?

215
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,500
And then he decides that the best thing
for him to do is rotate through and go

216
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:30,850
on patrol with them sometimes.
And I love the point of,

217
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:35,690
of moreover I would not be sharing in
the highest risk operations of my men.

218
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,390
So he knows he's got to take some
of the risks that they're taking.

219
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,900
That will also give them a chance
to appreciate their perceptions,

220
00:14:41,901 --> 00:14:43,100
needs and attitudes.

221
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,570
So if you're in a leadership position
and you never get down to the frontline

222
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,190
troopers and see what they're doing,
see what they're doing on the job site,

223
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,870
see they're doing in the field
and see what's going on out there.

224
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:57,890
You can't understand it.
And then he says this,

225
00:14:57,891 --> 00:15:00,950
finally I might slip into a
defensive attitude myself.

226
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:05,090
And that attitude would
eventually overtake the entire
platoon cause they're all

227
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:08,330
gonna turn into what he's
turned into or what he is.

228
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,030
Back to the book.

229
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:16,170
If a patrol made contact with the enemy
and it lasted for any length of time,

230
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,390
a second squad would be sent to react.

231
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,480
If I were inside the
perimeter at such a time,

232
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,520
I would move out with the reaction squad.

233
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,860
I firmly believed it was the duty of the
combat leader to move to the sound of

234
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:29,694
the guns,

235
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,290
especially when a majority
of the unit was engaged.

236
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,780
So he's going to be there when
things go sideways. He's gonna move.

237
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,280
Now,
back to his feelings on what this is like,

238
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,610
even more on inspiring than the scenery
was the realization that whatever took

239
00:15:52,281 --> 00:15:54,230
place in this part of the world,

240
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,800
whatever these men did or whatever
happened to them was my responsibility.

241
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,700
I might describe myself
as a long for the ride,

242
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,410
but whatever happened here or back at the
perimeter, I would have to account for,

243
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:13,490
to my superiors,
to my men and to myself.

244
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,310
I felt I was living a lie.

245
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:21,200
I was trying desperately to learn
what I was already supposed to know.

246
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,920
So the reason he's talking about that
is when he goes out with the squads,

247
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,770
there's a guy that's junior to him,

248
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:32,200
a sergeant that's running the
squad that's running the patrol,

249
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:34,510
and he's not going to go out
there and and be the boss.

250
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,810
He's going to go out there sort
of along for the ride. You know,

251
00:16:37,811 --> 00:16:39,520
he's not going to take
charge of the squad.

252
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:42,550
He's going to let them do what they do
and he's going to be more of an observer,

253
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,060
but he's, but that doesn't relinquish
any responsibility from him.

254
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,720
He still owns it. He's still taking
owner ship of the whole thing.

255
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,210
And this statement about,
I felt I was living a lie.

256
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,630
I was trying to desperately to learn
what I was already supposed to know.

257
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,140
That's very common for anybody stepping
up into new leadership position.

258
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,740
You don't think you're ready for it.
I mean often sometimes you feel confident,

259
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,530
but a lot of times people, when people
hit me up with questions, they say,

260
00:17:05,531 --> 00:17:06,364
you know what,
I'm taking,

261
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,340
I've been promoted and I don't
think I'm ready to do that job.

262
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,600
There's some very common to feel like that
and my statement, I've said it before,

263
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,560
it's okay. Yup. You know,
there's a cognitive bias that

264
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:24,580
when you're a real smart person,
you don't think you're that smart,

265
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,940
but when you're not that smart,
you think you're smart. Oh yeah.

266
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,940
100% of the country just,
we had these,

267
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,400
we had these forms that
we used to make the,

268
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,540
the leaders in the seal platoons fill out.
They would rank themselves one,

269
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,390
you know, one being the lowest
score, five being the highest score,

270
00:17:40,391 --> 00:17:44,230
and they'd grade themselves on whatever,
10 15 different items.

271
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,710
Tactical knowledge,
uh,

272
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:52,470
ability to lead understanding
of the troops are understanding
of the tactics and

273
00:17:53,341 --> 00:17:57,300
they had to grade themselves on
everything. Yeah. And 100% of the time,

274
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,370
100% of the time, I don't make that
claim very often. Oh, 100% of the time.

275
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:07,020
The guys that graded them,
so the guys that were really good,

276
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,170
really good leaders and really stepped
up and really doing a great job,

277
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,900
they'd give themselves a grade.
They're great.

278
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:16,980
Average would be like a solid 2.7
day. He'd be like, Oh, you know,

279
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,620
I could get better at this
and I could do better here.

280
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,430
The guys that were not good,

281
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:28,830
they were not good leaders
and their platoons were
struggling. Literally they're,

282
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:29,371
they're great.

283
00:18:29,371 --> 00:18:34,371
Average would be 5.0 they would gave
themselves a five and everything their

284
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:35,910
self,

285
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,510
that's arrogance just completely crushes
your ability to do a self assessment.

286
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:43,500
Yeah. Unbelievable. Interesting.

287
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,150
Back to the book,
back at the platoon base,

288
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:52,470
I busied myself learning more about the
tactical position and the personality of

289
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:57,330
the men. There was a distance
between us in those first hours.

290
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,610
I was not sure of their soldier
leanness and they were not sure of my

291
00:19:02,611 --> 00:19:04,800
leadership.
Fair enough.

292
00:19:04,801 --> 00:19:07,740
Little little mutual assessment
going on right there.

293
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:15,710
Now they're out on a patrol and there's a,

294
00:19:16,081 --> 00:19:18,840
one of the, one of the guys
spots, a guy named done,

295
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,200
he spots somebody and he sorta
gets ready to engage and uh,

296
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,980
Mcdonald's says, what
are you doing? And He,

297
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:36,270
and the sergeants reply was short VC.
I mean,

298
00:19:36,271 --> 00:19:39,810
these are Vietcong.
He says,

299
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:44,550
I felt it was time for me
to assert myself. I will
not allow the squad to fire.

300
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,750
I did not see any weapons.

301
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,420
And regardless of the political
leanings of the older man,

302
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:53,850
the boy to my way of thinking deserved
a little more consideration. Hold off.

303
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:57,420
I said to done his look,
spoke a thousand words.

304
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,640
He wasn't accustomed to
being second guessed.

305
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:04,500
Not only had he been a squad leader,
he had been leading the entire platoon.

306
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:06,510
And the reason he says that
is because in the, the, uh,

307
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,750
the old platoon commander who was weak
and was hiding this guy done was out

308
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:15,300
there making stuff happen.
And now I was challenging him.

309
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,470
My decision was made and I couldn't
back away. If I relinquished my command,

310
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:23,250
the squad would open fire. Both the
man and the boy were as good as dead.

311
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,450
Maybe done was right. What
did I know? I was a newcomer.

312
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,830
If I let him give orders, the
consequences were his, if I gave orders,

313
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,330
they were mine. No, I decided either way,

314
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:39,960
the consequences were mine.
I was the senior man.

315
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,530
Even if I look the other way,
I would have sanctioned the killing.

316
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,800
I stared back at done.
So

317
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,200
he's taken ownership.

318
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:54,670
One might even say he's taking extreme
ownership of the situation and despite

319
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,950
even if the other guy makes a decision,

320
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,960
he owns it because he's
the senior guy out there.

321
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,580
Now they're continue,

322
00:21:03,581 --> 00:21:08,581
so they let those guys live and now
they're continuing the patrol and back to

323
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,374
the book,

324
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:16,410
I sensed a slight poll on my right
fit foot and pivoting to my left.

325
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,980
I took a broad step.

326
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:24,180
The roaring in my ear was tremendous as
if in a dream I began floating in the

327
00:21:25,691 --> 00:21:30,580
direction of my last step. It was
still a warm, beautiful, clear day.

328
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,520
Yet somehow I didn't
seem to be there anymore.

329
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,920
I was going off into a deep sleep,

330
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,600
although my eyes were wide open and I
could see the soldiers in front of me

331
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:44,200
exactly as they had been a moment ago.
I continued to float,

332
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,460
how graceful I felt,
sensing everything in slow motion.

333
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:52,570
I saw the ground rising to meet my chest.
What a perfect landing.

334
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:55,330
It was the ground
sliding up underneath me.

335
00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:01,110
Then I heard that I rose again rebounding
from the impact and a below of of soft

336
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,680
fine dust particles. Again,
I ease down into the dirt,

337
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,800
sending a second thicker cloud of
brown debris rising around my face and

338
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:13,840
outstretched hands abruptly.

339
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:19,380
The pace of my thoughts quickened as
the surrealistic affects left my God,

340
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:25,540
we've been hit. Then the pace
increased to normal. Oh No, it's me.

341
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,400
I felt sick to my stomach.

342
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:30,940
I thought I would vomit and I
made my first deliberate movement.

343
00:22:30,941 --> 00:22:34,900
Since the explosion had gone off
in my ear from my prone position,

344
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:39,430
I jerked my head to the left
and gaped at my legs. Oh,

345
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,130
be there.
Please be there.

346
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,420
They were there bleeding and torn,
but they were there.

347
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,610
I was so happy. I wanted to
shout with joy. I was euphoric.

348
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,460
So he's walking and it's a booby trap.

349
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,840
That description is eerily similar to
Jody medics description of getting blown

350
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:11,470
up and yeah, I mean he, this, this, uh,

351
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,091
Mcdonald.

352
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:15,670
I ended up in a little bit
better situation in the
fact that he kept his legs.

353
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:20,680
But Jodi, the way Jody describes that
in his book is very similar. You know,

354
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:25,510
just boom and
horrible situation.

355
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,300
Back to the book.

356
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:33,220
A wounded leader is still a
leader unless so incapacitated.

357
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,630
He can't make decisions.

358
00:23:34,631 --> 00:23:38,800
I wasn't that bad off and I found it
somewhat consoling to assert myself as the

359
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:43,570
man in charge. At the very
least, it staved off the
shock that would come later.

360
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,590
So they get it,

361
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:50,570
they get him out of there and
he's on a stretcher. Anyways,

362
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,810
lying naked on a stretcher,
suspended between two chairs,

363
00:23:53,811 --> 00:23:56,600
I began to suffer the
first sensations of shock.

364
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:01,520
I began to shake so severely and I
thought once again I was going to vomit.

365
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,770
I was also afraid of
defecating where I lay.

366
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,660
I was so overcome with self pity that
for a second I caught myself starting to

367
00:24:11,661 --> 00:24:12,650
shed a tear.

368
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,990
The morphine was having its effect and
I was not in full control of my emotions

369
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,820
more than anything. I was scared.
I was no longer afraid I would die.

370
00:24:22,821 --> 00:24:25,610
I was afraid,
afraid because I could have died.

371
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,700
My heart was racing my body trembling,

372
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,240
the ringing in my ear confused my drug
thinking even more and I couldn't focus

373
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:39,140
my thoughts.
I only knew I had completely failed.

374
00:24:39,141 --> 00:24:43,640
In my first attempt to lead a
combat action, the West Pointer,

375
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,990
the paratrooper,

376
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:50,110
the ranger he had lasted less than 48
hours blown up by his own blundering

377
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,960
footwork and ill considered decisions.

378
00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:00,110
How in glorious at all seemed
lying there in my nakedness,

379
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,070
two ears on the ground for
48 hours and this happens.

380
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,830
Go in and take over the platoon calling.

381
00:25:06,831 --> 00:25:10,100
The other guy a coward
basically goes out on is,

382
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,970
I think it's this was his third patrol.
He had done two other patrols.

383
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:18,560
Nothing happened on those other patrols
and then boom, it gets blown up.

384
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,120
Now he's in the hospital for other
wounded soldiers, came aboard.

385
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:30,110
One was gut shot and about
four inches of his stomach.

386
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,610
We're poking out of his middle.

387
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:36,080
He shielded his wounds with his hands
as he walked out to the chopper.

388
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:42,790
One American Armored Cavalry platoon had
just been been ambushed in the five oh

389
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:48,101
six valley south of bongs song and nine
bloated and charred but still alive.

390
00:25:50,121 --> 00:25:52,820
Soldiers were brought
in in place next to me.

391
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:57,980
They smelled awful and their pain
was excruciating, mercifully,

392
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,510
some were unconscious,

393
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:04,160
but those awake we're
screaming the violent shaking.

394
00:26:04,161 --> 00:26:07,940
I had experienced that to Lz.
English was rampant among the group.

395
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,540
I was grateful to be an infantry man.

396
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,320
I wouldn't want to travel in gasoline
fed machines that invariably exploded and

397
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:18,860
burned when hit.

398
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,720
A Vietnamese soldier had been brought
in and placed ahead of me signifying the

399
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:27,860
greater severity of his wounds.

400
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:33,140
He too had been gut shot and apparently
his stomach and intestines had

401
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:37,520
completely spilled out.
His stomach lay quite exposed,

402
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:42,790
but his intestines still attached had
been dumped into a sand bag which was tied

403
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:47,040
creek purely to his thigh.
When he was brought in,

404
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:50,010
he was unconscious,
but after a while he came to,

405
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,640
I saw him lift his head
and stare at the sandbag,

406
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,550
what he saw and made him pass out again.

407
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:02,070
The cycle of coming to looking at his
intestines and passing out was repeated

408
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:05,340
three times on the last go around.

409
00:27:05,341 --> 00:27:07,740
He must have died for,

410
00:27:07,741 --> 00:27:12,180
he was abruptly removed from line and
taken away from the operating room.

411
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,450
Okay.

412
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,490
Doesn't matter what war it is.

413
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:20,570
You go into that hospital where they're
bringing in those wounded soldiers

414
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,053
and it's grueling,

415
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,693
okay?

416
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:32,660
He gets,
luckily his wounds weren't that bad.

417
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:37,550
He gets healed up in a few weeks and

418
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:43,820
goes back right back into right
back into it, right back into it,

419
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,780
and here they're going out on patrol
and I mean,

420
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:54,620
think about that. He got blown
up. He's there for 48 hours.

421
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:59,810
He gets blown up, he gets sent to the
hospital for three weeks, heals up.

422
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:03,200
I mean you're, you're, you're, you might
as well have died when you step on an IED.

423
00:28:03,201 --> 00:28:05,750
Just do some matters and how big it was.
This one of,

424
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:07,160
obviously it wasn't
big enough to kill him,

425
00:28:07,161 --> 00:28:08,690
but if it would have been a
little bit bigger, he'd be dead.

426
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,240
Or if the shrapnel went in the wrong spot,
he'd be dead.

427
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:13,940
Or if you stand in a little bit
closer to do it, he'd be dead.

428
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:18,350
Or if or if whatever, they didn't
get it out in time, he'd be dead.

429
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,600
If it hit a vein, he'd be dead.
If hit an artery, he'd be dead.

430
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,020
So he knows that and guess what?
Doesn't matter.

431
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:29,240
Giddy up, go back out there. You're
back in the game and here we go.

432
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:34,870
They're going out on patrol. I placed
myself fourth in the order of March.

433
00:28:34,871 --> 00:28:39,710
As we slid out the wire,
the first 50 yards were tolerable,

434
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:44,420
but as we left the relative security of
the perimeter further and further behind,

435
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:48,920
I began to dread that each footstep
would land me on another booby trap.

436
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:54,140
I tried not to think about my wounds and
the mayhem and Gore I had seen during

437
00:28:54,141 --> 00:28:57,080
the past few weeks,
but the more I tried to forget,

438
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:02,170
the more clearly I remembered if I was
going to die and I began to grieve my,

439
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,930
for myself,
for my wife,

440
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:10,940
for the little boy who would never really
know his father sweat poured from my

441
00:29:10,941 --> 00:29:13,880
forehead, my back, my every joint.

442
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,040
My stomach was as tight as it.

443
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:21,041
Not each step felt as
if it might paralyze me.

444
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I tried hard to feel my legs so I would
remember them long after they were blown

445
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,580
off.
I was torturing myself.

446
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,370
Then I realized that the
other men must be afraid to,

447
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:42,550
yet they kept moving.
I was their leader.

448
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,600
I had been trained for my job in the
best installations in the U s army,

449
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:50,980
had to offer west point,
airborne school, Ranger School,

450
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,690
jungle warfare school.

451
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,230
How could I be deficient
after such an investment?

452
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,560
While my men wrenched from unmilitary
backgrounds into the army and quickly

453
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:06,400
processed and an in personal training
facilities continue to do their duty.

454
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,100
Somehow I kept moving.

455
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:15,090
I could not allow myself to appear
cowardly in the eyes of those men besides

456
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,720
there was no place else to go.

457
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:30,890
That IED booby trap
threat is just horrifying.

458
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:33,340
Okay.

459
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,110
And you know it's scary enough for,

460
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:38,580
for just being over there when you see
the destruction that it causes, but,

461
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:43,680
but getting blown up and
actually personally stepping
on an IED and then you're

462
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:47,230
back in the field three
weeks later in the same area,

463
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,240
patrolling the same ground.

464
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,710
That's courage
now is there.

465
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,040
Okay.

466
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,050
Moving into position on an ambush site.

467
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:05,760
He's getting some stuff from his gear
and here we go. Back to the book.

468
00:31:05,761 --> 00:31:07,860
As I struggled through the undergrowth,

469
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:12,510
the lace called on a branch and pulled
the compass loose from its birth,

470
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:16,200
causing it to fall on the
ground where it struck a rock.

471
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:20,790
The metallic case Made
Allowed Ping as it bounced.

472
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,870
Without hesitation,
I yelled booby trap

473
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,550
lurch to the right,
threw myself to the ground,

474
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,880
covered my head with my arms and tried
to pull my legs up to my button brace for

475
00:31:35,611 --> 00:31:37,950
the explosion that was
about to rip me apart.

476
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,403
Okay.

477
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,460
And all the other guys are doing
the same thing, diving for cover.

478
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,310
So if you didn't catch that,

479
00:31:47,311 --> 00:31:52,311
he was just moving through the brush
and something caught on his compass and

480
00:31:52,531 --> 00:31:56,640
pulled it out of its pocket and it fell
to the ground and he heard that metallic

481
00:31:56,641 --> 00:31:58,830
noise and he yelled out. I
mean, here they're on patrol.

482
00:31:58,831 --> 00:31:59,900
They're setting up an ambush.

483
00:31:59,901 --> 00:32:03,030
So this will just be quiet and tactical
and silent and all of a sudden he's

484
00:32:03,031 --> 00:32:06,240
yelling out booby trap and diving to the
ground and makes everyone okay cover.

485
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,650
So they come back from that and he says,

486
00:32:13,651 --> 00:32:17,130
I took the time to debrief the
platoon upon reentry to the perimeter,

487
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:20,970
pointing out the strong points and the
weak points of the knights actions.

488
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:24,510
I did not spare myself in the critique.

489
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,790
I simply stated what had happened. I
had made a mistake, but an honest one.

490
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,690
There were a few subdued
comments by the patrol members,

491
00:32:33,691 --> 00:32:38,430
all of whom clearly recognize the
danger of my action. It didn't matter.

492
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,130
I'd overcome my fear.

493
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,810
I was once again in control of my
platoon and more importantly myself.

494
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:49,890
So when you make a
mistake, own it. That's,

495
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,100
that's what you gotta do when
you make a mistake. Own it.

496
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,640
Back to the bulk of my
indoctrination period was over.

497
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,350
I had been blooded but survived.
I had been embarrassed,

498
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,400
but would recover.

499
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,420
The early shocks had been merciful
in that they were over quickly.

500
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,250
I could now turn my attention away from
the self conscience concerns of how I

501
00:33:11,251 --> 00:33:15,720
would fit into this alien environment
and how I might be perceived by the

502
00:33:15,721 --> 00:33:16,770
soldiers I lead.

503
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:21,930
I could concentrate instead upon improving
my style of leadership and fighting

504
00:33:21,931 --> 00:33:26,550
the enemy,
there was much to do for too long.

505
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:32,150
The platoon had done only those things
necessary to minimize casualties and

506
00:33:32,671 --> 00:33:34,860
approach that in the long road,

507
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,670
which surely lead to maximum casualties.

508
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,670
So you want to sit back, you
want to, you want to hide,

509
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:49,220
you're letting the enemy get a get a
drop on you and he knows that you got to

510
00:33:49,221 --> 00:33:54,221
take some risk up front to prevent
the long term extreme risk.

511
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,063
Okay.

512
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,123
Back to the book.

513
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,690
An old army adage claims
that soldiers only do well,

514
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:06,290
that which their commander
checks in combat.

515
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:07,940
Everything must be done well.

516
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,150
Yet I realized I couldn't
possibly check everything,

517
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,580
but I could create the illusion
that everything was being checked,

518
00:34:16,581 --> 00:34:21,581
especially if I use the squad leaders and
the platoon sergeants as extensions of

519
00:34:21,831 --> 00:34:23,000
my own will.

520
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,040
So a little bit of
decentralized command there.

521
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:33,350
He knows he can't inspect everything.
He can't be everywhere all the time.

522
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,990
But if he uses proper
decentralized command,

523
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:39,320
he can make it happen cause his leaders,
his subordinate leaders,

524
00:34:39,321 --> 00:34:40,250
we'll make it happen.

525
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,630
Back to the book.
Not only tactics,

526
00:34:45,631 --> 00:34:49,470
but all matters relevant to our life
in the field had to be supervised.

527
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:54,300
For instance, health habits had to be
inspected as diligently as weapons were.

528
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,310
Soldiers have to be kept clean.

529
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:01,350
They have to shave and watch wash and
the squad leader has to see that they do.

530
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,140
Soldiers need a place
to relieve themselves.

531
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,770
A place secure from both
enemy and the disease.

532
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,660
Mesac women has to be kept clean
and soldiers need a balanced diet.

533
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,610
Feet must be cared for.

534
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:18,390
A squad leader is accountable for the
changing of socks as he is for the

535
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:19,980
cleaning of weapons.

536
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:25,650
Men on alert must stay awake no matter
how exhausting the preceding hours have

537
00:35:25,651 --> 00:35:28,050
been.
Radios have to be monitored.

538
00:35:28,051 --> 00:35:30,750
Cap dried and supplied
with fresh batteries.

539
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,780
Proper communication
procedures must be maintained.

540
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:38,940
Codes must not be pro compromised.
Positions must be constantly improved.

541
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:43,440
The Claymore mines have to be checked
camouflaged in re camouflaged trenches

542
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:46,980
have to be deepened. Firing positions
must be made more lethal to the enemy.

543
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:51,420
Artillery fires must be registered and
reregistered grass adjacent to the wire

544
00:35:51,421 --> 00:35:54,870
must be kept cut.
The ammunition bunker has to be kept dry.

545
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:59,460
Soldiers must rehearse in
all combat situations that
the that may be expected of

546
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:00,180
them.

547
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,270
The functioning of the chain of command
must be clearly understood by all the

548
00:36:03,271 --> 00:36:05,010
men in combat.

549
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:09,630
Leaders are quickly a traded and every
man in his turn must be prepared to take

550
00:36:09,631 --> 00:36:10,464
over the mission.

551
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,140
Lot of stuff to handle. That's why he's
saying he can't do all that himself.

552
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,530
You have to use decentralized
command in these situations.

553
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:25,750
Back to the book,
I checked positions at night.

554
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:30,850
Every night I lay behind the machine
guns to the men in the strong points.

555
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,210
I check the frequency of the
radio carried by the RTO.

556
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,770
I ate my eat meals at irregular hours,
sometimes alone,

557
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,460
sometimes with a group of soldiers.
I sat and listened to the men.

558
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,490
I studied their manner of speech,
their gate,

559
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:50,140
the fact that they were left or
right handed, how soundly they slept,

560
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,480
how well they saw in the dark.
I listened to their stories,

561
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,310
their hopes,
their gripes.

562
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,760
I tried not to speak about myself.

563
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:05,680
They're concerned about me was whether
or not I could get them through their

564
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:10,240
tour. They might want to tell me
about their homes and their families,

565
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,760
but they wanted me to listen,
not talk.

566
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,480
They did not want to know about
my life away from Vietnam.

567
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,380
I was an officer in their
eyes that made me different.

568
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,610
I was a part of this war.

569
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,660
I was one of the they.

570
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,550
They drafted the soldier.
They trained him.

571
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:38,850
They ordered him to this God forsaken
place and they sent him out on terrifying

572
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:41,920
missions to be maimed and killed.

573
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:46,570
They did not have a life
other than the army.

574
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,600
They were the army.

575
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:58,020
So I listened and I watched these men
were the prime resource of the platoon.

576
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:05,080
They would fulfill its missions.
They would do their country's bidding,

577
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,690
but they were men first.

578
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,140
They were not so many boots on parade.

579
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,180
They were human.
They have loves fears,

580
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,030
futures that they hope to see.

581
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,370
They made me wonder,

582
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:28,080
was I coming to know them too well to
make them do what they had to do or did I

583
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:32,350
not know them well enough
to ask them to do it?

584
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:38,920
I say that all the time.

585
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,800
That's one of the misconceptions about
the military is that the people that are

586
00:38:44,801 --> 00:38:48,460
in the military are people.
They're humans.

587
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:53,440
Not so many boots on parade.

588
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:58,483
Okay?

589
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:03,710
Now he's talks a little bit about
the enemy. The enemy were also young,

590
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:08,270
also adherence of a humanistic faith
in which killing was not the essence of

591
00:39:08,271 --> 00:39:09,104
life.

592
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:14,980
Yet now we faced each other obsessed
with the idea of killing each other.

593
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,730
There was no risk bite from it.

594
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,690
Once a day I wrote a letter to my wife.

595
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:27,380
It was a moment of sanity
snatched from the madness of war.

596
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,383
If anything,

597
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:33,440
my thoughts of home reinforced my desire
to stay alive and my determination to

598
00:39:33,441 --> 00:39:37,220
keep the enemy from killing me.
They would not kill me.

599
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:41,810
They would not kill my men.
We would kill them. First

600
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:48,700
war is the management of violence claimed
the contemporary social scientists and

601
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:53,930
military strategists. As we hacked our
way through the struggle of Vietnam,

602
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,650
for us,
violence was killing.

603
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,310
There was no management involved.

604
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,150
People were either dead or they were not.

605
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,440
I could not manage mypal tune up a hill.

606
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,320
I had to lead them up there.

607
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:18,170
I had a mission to accomplish and I had
men to keep alive as many as I could.

608
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:23,030
I had to do more than keep them alive.

609
00:40:23,031 --> 00:40:25,340
I had to preserve their human dignity.

610
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,250
I was making them kill,

611
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,480
forcing them to commit the
most uncivilized of acts,

612
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,050
but at the same time,
I had to keep them civilized.

613
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:41,750
That was my duty as their leader.
They were good men,

614
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:47,680
but they were facing death and men
facing death can forgive themselves many

615
00:40:48,021 --> 00:40:48,854
things.

616
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:53,480
War gives the appearance of
condoning almost everything,

617
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,500
but men must live with their
actions for a long time. Afterward,

618
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:03,430
a leader has to help them understand
that there are lines they must not cross.

619
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:11,370
He is their link to normalicy
to order to humanity.

620
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,560
If the leader loses his own sense of
propriety or shrinks from his duty,

621
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,590
anything will be allowed
and anything can happen.

622
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:26,720
Some men in combat will commit
war crimes just to some.

623
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:29,660
Some men in combat will fail
to take care of themselves.

624
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,260
They will experiment with
drugs, steal property, abused.

625
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:35,541
When this happens,

626
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:40,310
it destroys the discipline
of a unit making it easier
for others to follow. Suit.

627
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,810
War is at its very core.

628
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:49,870
The absence of order and the absence
of order leads to very easily to the

629
00:41:50,751 --> 00:41:52,160
absence of morality.

630
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:56,060
Unless the leader can preserve
each of them in its place.

631
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,680
The leader has to set the standards
for morality as clearly as he sets the

632
00:42:00,681 --> 00:42:04,160
standards for personal hygiene
or weapons maintenance.

633
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,730
He must allow no cutting of corners,

634
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:13,750
a bottle of soda stolen from an old
peasant woman leads gradually but directly

635
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:17,630
to the rape of her daughter.
If the line is not drawn in the beginning.

636
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:21,803
Yeah.

637
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,140
There's a lot of Deckard
dichotomy in there and,

638
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:30,430
and this is one I've talked about before.
I was making them kill,

639
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:34,030
forcing them to commit the most in civil,
uncivilized of acts,

640
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:37,540
but at the same time I had
to keep them civilized.

641
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,183
Okay.

642
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,640
Then you know, another one
that I talk about all the time,

643
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,273
okay.

644
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,530
Is the fact that you care about your men

645
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:57,160
more than anything and yet you have to
send them out pawn missions where they

646
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:05,501
can be gravely wounded or killed
until this is what a combat leader is

647
00:43:06,621 --> 00:43:08,570
struggling with.
This is the dichotomy of leadership.

648
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:09,763
Yup.

649
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:18,250
This was war,
this Vietnam involvement,

650
00:43:18,251 --> 00:43:20,560
and in war things tend to happen,

651
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:26,580
but the commander was the link to order
and civility and he had to be humane at

652
00:43:27,911 --> 00:43:32,200
the same time. He had to be
uncompromising to protect the lives of all

653
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:35,560
the job was not easy.

654
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,653
Okay?

655
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:44,600
The job was not easy. No, sir, it was not.

656
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:46,543
Okay.

657
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:54,250
Now he goes into a chapter that's
called a cast of characters where she's

658
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:55,990
describing some of the people

659
00:43:58,450 --> 00:43:59,283
in the platoon

660
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:06,050
who were the sons that
America sent to war in vain.

661
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,780
I looked for the arc,

662
00:44:09,781 --> 00:44:13,650
typical platoon of romantic fiction.

663
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,550
The kid from Brooklyn wasn't there.

664
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,270
The incipient poet never made it.

665
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:28,080
The rich mom was boy out to prove his
manhood stayed home as a cross section of

666
00:44:28,991 --> 00:44:32,520
America's youth.
The platoon was complete failure.

667
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:37,740
So all these care typical characters
that you see in the movies and this idea

668
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:40,300
that it's a cross section
of America. No, it wasn't.

669
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:42,720
Okay.

670
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,330
The military draft was
never concerned with equity.

671
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:49,200
It's sole purpose was to obtain the
required numbers of men would sufficient

672
00:44:49,201 --> 00:44:51,570
mental and physical
qualities to do the job.

673
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:57,860
Since the pool of men from which to draw
as much greater than the numbers needed,

674
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:02,450
a natural selection process allowed the
educated and the privilege to avoid the

675
00:45:02,451 --> 00:45:03,770
draft altogether.

676
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:10,310
The selection process continued for the
unfortunate it's drafted so that those

677
00:45:10,351 --> 00:45:15,030
with some education or particular skills
would be diverted from combat service.

678
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:22,430
Even among those who made it to Vietnam,
the vast majority never saw combat.

679
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:23,560
Okay.

680
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,300
Only those without skill.

681
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:30,480
Without schooling and without friends or
who's or who were obstinate in the face

682
00:45:30,851 --> 00:45:35,170
of ceaseless proselytizing
against their obligation to serve,

683
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:36,760
made it to the field.

684
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:38,660
Okay.

685
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:39,980
And they knew it.

686
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:41,323
Okay.

687
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:47,200
Talking about some of the guys here,

688
00:45:47,201 --> 00:45:51,130
he's got a guy named Jim
Barnes from Asheville,

689
00:45:51,131 --> 00:45:53,260
North Carolina who is,

690
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,150
yeah,

691
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:57,540
good solid operator.
Got a really bad stutter,

692
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:04,810
um, guy named Corporal John
Killigan from Bakersfield,

693
00:46:04,811 --> 00:46:08,980
California. And he's sort of
is the, throughout the book.

694
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:13,050
He's a guy that is sort of the,
the model soldier.

695
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,010
Okay.

696
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:19,010
And He's 22 years old already on
his third tour of duty in Vietnam.

697
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:23,080
And by the way, a tour in Vietnam was
a year long. So this guy's throat.

698
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:26,400
So Killigan is on his third tour
in Vietnam. Most combat experience,

699
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:29,400
soldier in the platoon,
everyone respected him,

700
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:35,230
but no one considered him a friend.
Um,

701
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:37,780
the reason was simple why
he was so well respected.

702
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:38,680
Okay.

703
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:42,520
He was the best soldier among us.
He had the reflexes of a cat.

704
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:44,050
He was a deadly shot.

705
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:48,520
And ferocious in a fight and he never
showed the slightest bit of concern for

706
00:46:48,521 --> 00:46:49,390
his own safety.

707
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:53,743
Awesome.

708
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:01,560
There were so many ways to avoid
ending up as a combat infantry men.

709
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:07,110
There were so many of their countrymen
who would never see an olive drab uniform

710
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:10,920
or a drill sergeant or
the green hell of Vietnam,

711
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:16,740
but each of these men seemed destined to
end up there as if it had been written

712
00:47:17,941 --> 00:47:20,760
in granted on the day of his birth.

713
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,500
They did not complain.

714
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,090
This is what those guys
live with a little bit.

715
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:35,920
I noticed one day that specialists
Barnes turned away when one particularly

716
00:47:35,921 --> 00:47:40,060
beautiful girl walk close by him as he
was clearing a thicket of underbrush away

717
00:47:40,061 --> 00:47:40,894
from the wire.

718
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:47,760
The girls left arm was missing her empty
sleeve folded neatly and pinned to her

719
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:50,800
shoulder.
What's the matter?

720
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:55,801
Barns I asked and his painstakingly slow
stutter Barnes explained that the girl

721
00:47:57,341 --> 00:48:01,480
and her lover were among a group of
armed Viet Cong who walked through one of

722
00:48:01,481 --> 00:48:04,870
our ambushes.
One night the ambush was sprung,

723
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:10,480
the boyfriend was killed and the
girl's arm was mangled by a bullet.

724
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:15,340
The girl was evacuated by the Americans,
but her arm could not be saved.

725
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:20,500
Eventually she returned
to work her fields.

726
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:25,480
What do you say to a girl who's armed?
You shot off.

727
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,900
Barnes asked me his stutter
clearing for a minute.

728
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:35,730
I could think of no reply.
Now

729
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:42,120
they're starting to get some intelligence
report that there's ominous forecast

730
00:48:42,121 --> 00:48:43,680
that there's going to be some big attack,

731
00:48:43,681 --> 00:48:48,681
some big enemy thrusts and he's
taking some time to prepare for that.

732
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:55,110
My targets for improvement,
we're disciplined and tactics.

733
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,010
The two are closely related
in the heat of battle.

734
00:48:59,011 --> 00:49:02,970
There is no time for second guessing
the per commander and is necessary for a

735
00:49:02,971 --> 00:49:05,730
soldier to develop an
automatic response to an order.

736
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:10,320
Such instantaneous obedience will
overcome all fears, all confusion,

737
00:49:10,321 --> 00:49:12,720
all inclinations towards
self preservation.

738
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:18,480
Eight is the result of unmitigated daily
discipline in all things from taking

739
00:49:20,251 --> 00:49:24,750
the daily malaria pill to shaving each
day to attacking in the face of an

740
00:49:24,751 --> 00:49:25,890
automatic weapon.

741
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,140
I'm adding this to my life,

742
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:39,110
the statement of unmitigated
daily discipline in all things.

743
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:42,350
They're heading out on a patrol

744
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:46,190
and as

745
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:50,840
mcdonough heads up the line to inspect.

746
00:49:50,841 --> 00:49:53,090
Some of the soldiers
here we go to the book.

747
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:57,590
Suddenly there was a hollow sounding
explosion and a whistling past my year,

748
00:49:57,591 --> 00:50:02,420
followed by another explosion a second
later about 150 meters out in the bushes

749
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:08,120
I spun around to see king. It's one of
the guys king with a sneer on his face,

750
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,530
sorry, Lt, the words
he has from his mouth,

751
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,150
I dropped my weapon,

752
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,920
the grenade launcher dangled from his
right hand a waft of smoke curling up from

753
00:50:21,231 --> 00:50:22,064
the barrel.

754
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,480
It was clear that he had fired
his 40 millimeter round at me

755
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:32,380
at that range he could not have missed.
So he must have meant it as a warning.

756
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,260
He was telling me he did
not like my attitude.

757
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:39,670
So you got McDonald who's been imposing
discipline and trying to keep the guys

758
00:50:39,671 --> 00:50:44,020
squared away and this guy doesn't like
it and so he sends them a little warning

759
00:50:44,021 --> 00:50:46,360
shot with his,
with his m 79 grenade launcher.

760
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:54,250
I was scared, but I was angry to
king, had not only threatened my life,

761
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:56,680
but my authority as well.
A few weeks earlier,

762
00:50:56,681 --> 00:50:58,570
I might've been overcome by the situation,

763
00:50:58,571 --> 00:51:02,770
but since then I had developed a thick
skin necessary for survival in Vietnam

764
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:08,470
with murder in my eyes.
I looked into king's face slowly,

765
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:09,520
deliberately.

766
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:12,730
I walked up to him saying nothing
until I was close enough to touch him.

767
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,930
I had made no threatening gesture.

768
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,990
Suddenly when I was close
enough to smell his breath,

769
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:22,950
I flicked my [inaudible] in the fire
position and placed the muzzle of the

770
00:51:22,951 --> 00:51:27,810
weapon and the cavity of the underside
of his chin. He went up on his toes.

771
00:51:27,811 --> 00:51:30,030
As I increase the pressure
of the rifle barrel,

772
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:32,850
lifting him up against
the bottom of his head,

773
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:39,310
the sneer was now on my face as I raised
my voice so everyone could hear you,

774
00:51:39,321 --> 00:51:40,730
son of a bitch.

775
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:44,800
The eyes of everyone in the
platoon were riveted on us.

776
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:48,340
Drop your weapon again and
you better pray to God.

777
00:51:48,341 --> 00:51:51,610
It hits me square in the back
because if it doesn't you bastard,

778
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,190
I'll blow your brains to kingdom come.

779
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:01,590
Not a man stirred,
putting down a little rebellion.

780
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:08,750
But again, this is something
where you to think about that.

781
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:09,890
I mean from my perspective,

782
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:14,540
nothing like that ever came close to
happening me at any time was it? Was it,

783
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:19,100
was there any time where I ever thought
any of my guys would do anything in any

784
00:52:19,101 --> 00:52:21,770
way to hurt me in any situation.
In fact,

785
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:24,140
those guys would do
anything to do to save me.

786
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:26,000
They would never let
anything happen to me.

787
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:28,580
And here you have one of your guys that
just decides is going to give you a

788
00:52:28,581 --> 00:52:31,810
little warning shot with a 40
millimeter grenade launcher. Yeah,

789
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,090
cause he doesn't like here
added tooth or whatever.

790
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:40,640
They're probably had a lot to do with
a lot of those guys didn't want to be

791
00:52:40,641 --> 00:52:42,530
there. Absolutely. Absolutely.

792
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,133
Now they

793
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:49,873
are

794
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:55,400
moving forward on a patrol.
They had a little incident happen

795
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,390
and they find a corpse
from the book.

796
00:53:01,391 --> 00:53:04,360
Now I was becoming fairly
accustomed to viewing the dead,

797
00:53:04,361 --> 00:53:06,850
but this cadaver was
particularly grotesque.

798
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,320
It was the old woman who
had cared for the children.

799
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:14,010
Both her breasts had been
half severed from her body.

800
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:17,100
A Deliberate Cup made on
the underside of each.

801
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:22,590
Each palm and the sole of each foot had
been shot through with a small caliber

802
00:53:22,591 --> 00:53:26,610
round the killing wound,
which no doubt had followed.

803
00:53:26,611 --> 00:53:31,350
The earlier torturous wounds was a blast
from a weapon weapon evidently placed

804
00:53:31,351 --> 00:53:34,320
inside her mouth and directed
out the back of her head.

805
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,440
Her eyes were open,

806
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:42,710
transfixed and terror jabbed into her
belly on the end of a street and safety

807
00:53:43,111 --> 00:53:44,460
pin was a note.

808
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:49,500
Nan the Kit Carson scout
translated it for me.

809
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:56,120
Twan cow key has been found guilty by
the People's Court of aiding the American

810
00:53:56,461 --> 00:54:01,461
imperialists and their suppression of
the Vietnamese people as an enemy of the

811
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,530
people she has been made
to pay for her crimes.

812
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:09,540
This is the justice that will be brought
to all who consort with the Americans

813
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:13,260
and aid them in the villainous
suppression of our land.

814
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:16,350
War is hell

815
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:22,043
now.

816
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,560
They start to get

817
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:29,580
attacked inside their perimeter

818
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:36,870
and here we go. At that moment, the
first rush was made by the enemy.

819
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:41,580
20 to 30 Viet Cong appeared coming
at the south wire to dead run.

820
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:46,380
I shouted from my men to shift fire on
them. There was no need for my words.

821
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:48,090
My men were responding well.

822
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:52,140
We were getting off a handheld
flare every 30 seconds,

823
00:54:52,141 --> 00:54:54,660
which illuminated the
rushing enemy very clearly.

824
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:59,760
The two machine guns on that portion of
our perimeter barked out a welcome and

825
00:54:59,761 --> 00:55:03,720
neat six round bursts.
Several of the enemy fell there.

826
00:55:03,721 --> 00:55:06,330
First rush was stopped in its tracks.

827
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:09,940
Okay.

828
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:13,870
It was becoming increasingly clear that
the machine gun was going to be the key

829
00:55:13,871 --> 00:55:16,000
weapon in the initial
stoppage of the fight

830
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,200
and I just highlighted
that because I know I get,

831
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:22,190
I hear from military guys all the time,

832
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:27,520
guys that are overseas and I just
wanted to reiterate that in a firefight,

833
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,950
the machine gun is the key weapon.

834
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:39,090
Now they're continuing to being
attacked and from the south east,

835
00:55:39,091 --> 00:55:41,520
a woman came running toward
the break in the wire,

836
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:44,400
she was carrying a bulky
object in her arms,

837
00:55:44,401 --> 00:55:47,820
but in the flickering light of the flares,
it was impossible to identify it.

838
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,890
Don't fire Lawrence barked.

839
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,170
I was not sure I agreed
if it was a Satchel charge
that the woman was carrying.

840
00:55:55,171 --> 00:55:58,140
She would be able to fling it
in and us and another few steps.

841
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:01,650
The explosion would rip apart
that perimeter wide open,

842
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:06,870
allowing the enemy to rush through
unimpeded. On the other hand,

843
00:56:06,871 --> 00:56:10,110
if the woman was seeking help,
it would be a tragedy to cut her down.

844
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,050
As I hesitated, the heavy beat
of enemy rounds forced her down.

845
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:20,610
Lawrence made a dash for the wire, got
10 steps, and then went into a low crawl,

846
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:21,870
inching his way along.

847
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:26,170
He made it to a break the wire and
came up to the woman in her arms,

848
00:56:26,171 --> 00:56:29,380
was her seven year old daughter.
The little girl had taken around,

849
00:56:29,381 --> 00:56:33,580
clean through the chest, along was
collapsed and she was bleeding heavily.

850
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:38,740
Her mother was trying to make
it to us to save the child.

851
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:41,523
Okay,

852
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,040
so again,
this is the dichotomy of war.

853
00:56:44,041 --> 00:56:48,990
You got people torturing
and murdering old women,

854
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:53,310
and then you get this situation where
there's a woman who's rushing the

855
00:56:53,311 --> 00:56:58,170
perimeter and this guy, you know, says
he's don't shoot her and then crawls out,

856
00:56:58,171 --> 00:57:01,500
risk his life to go and try and find
out what the situation is and helper

857
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,480
there is darkness and there's light.

858
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:07,463
Okay.

859
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:15,020
They
beat back that attack

860
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:19,940
and the next morning
they go out on patrol.

861
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:23,660
Killigan was the point man on the first
patrol out the morning after the fight

862
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:27,500
all night he'd worked in machine gun
from the southern tip of the platoon

863
00:57:27,501 --> 00:57:32,030
triangle, his steady hand
holding the enemy rushes at bay.

864
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:33,380
Early in the fight,

865
00:57:33,381 --> 00:57:36,820
the attackers had recognized Gilligan's
prowess and tried their best to put them

866
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:38,900
out of action.
The sound,

867
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:43,220
the sandbag surrounding his position
were torn and poked from the bullets and

868
00:57:43,221 --> 00:57:46,310
shrapnel aimed at his early retirement.

869
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,640
He had not flinched throughout the night

870
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:55,010
and now he took up the point with
the alertness of a well rested cat.

871
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,070
The man seemed indestructable.

872
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:10,430
Now he starts talking a little bit about
the situation that they were in and in

873
00:58:10,431 --> 00:58:13,610
some moves that he made and one of the
things he did was he kept his forces

874
00:58:13,611 --> 00:58:18,020
together at this point when they had been
attacked or he reunited as forces and

875
00:58:18,021 --> 00:58:20,240
he talks about that here
had the enemy's struck.

876
00:58:20,241 --> 00:58:22,160
While my meager forces were split,

877
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:25,970
they might've overwhelmed one
or both elements piecemeal,

878
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:32,030
controlling the separated elements
would also have been almost impossible.

879
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:36,470
And the subsequent coordination of outside
support such as air strike and armor

880
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:41,471
platoon would have been too hazardous had
we even survive long enough to receive

881
00:58:41,991 --> 00:58:43,400
help. So he's talking about, again,

882
00:58:43,401 --> 00:58:46,490
this is just going out to people that
are in the military, in the field.

883
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:51,360
Avoid splitting your forces up.
Just just avoid sweetened.

884
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:54,290
Sometimes you obviously have to do it,
but always think about it.

885
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:57,740
Think about the ramifications of it when
you're split up number one, year two,

886
00:58:57,741 --> 00:59:00,050
year two elements are weak.
That's why when you do split up,

887
00:59:00,051 --> 00:59:02,030
you should stay as often as you can.

888
00:59:02,031 --> 00:59:05,720
Stay within position of mutual support
where your weapons can support the other

889
00:59:05,721 --> 00:59:08,100
group. And you can bring
them back to your perimeter,

890
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,980
you can attack or you can
flank or you can support them.

891
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:13,130
The other thing that's very difficult
when you're split up is it's very

892
00:59:13,131 --> 00:59:17,990
difficult to control what's
happening. Yeah. Cause you
likely out of verbal range,

893
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:21,860
you could possibly be out of
radio range. And now, now,

894
00:59:21,861 --> 00:59:23,150
how are you going to control
what's going to happen?

895
00:59:23,151 --> 00:59:24,350
So if you do have to split up,

896
00:59:24,351 --> 00:59:29,090
make sure you have very good loss of
communication plans to, to react to.

897
00:59:29,091 --> 00:59:30,890
If something happens,
we're going to go to this muster point,

898
00:59:30,891 --> 00:59:32,570
here's going to be the signaling
we want to come in there.

899
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,340
So you've got to think about that.

900
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,970
And finally when you split your forces
up on the battlefield and you lose

901
00:59:37,971 --> 00:59:41,660
control of them, now you can't
call for air support. You can't.

902
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:45,830
It's very difficult to get help and
bring the funder let you would want to

903
00:59:45,831 --> 00:59:47,300
because you don't know where everybody is.

904
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,030
So when you do have to split force switch,

905
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:52,730
you do absolutely have to do
sometimes avoided as much as you can.

906
00:59:52,731 --> 00:59:56,720
And then when you have to plan for the
worst case scenario so that you're ready

907
00:59:56,721 --> 00:59:57,554
for it.

908
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:05,770
Now they're back to kind of sorting
things out. After this hardcore battle,

909
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:07,690
when they,
when the VC attacked,

910
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:12,940
my eyes were turned to the body's
laying so lying, so neatly in line.

911
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:15,550
Why did we line them up anyways?

912
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:22,290
Was it a pension for neatness and attempt
to bring some order orderliness to the

913
01:00:22,291 --> 01:00:25,800
disorder of death?
He was so absurd.

914
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:28,800
I remembered reading somewhere
that in World War II,

915
01:00:28,801 --> 01:00:31,710
the Germans had lined up the
bodies of American prisoners.

916
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:36,711
They massacred disorder and order
barbarity and Siviletti civility,

917
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:43,800
ironic juxtapositions in
the affairs of men. Again,

918
01:00:43,801 --> 01:00:46,140
we're just talking about dichotomy of war.

919
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:52,610
My elation was reduced to a sense of
insignificance by the Cold Brown look of

920
01:00:53,221 --> 01:00:57,510
the corpse sprawled in the
bright sunlight. A few hours ago,

921
01:00:57,511 --> 01:01:00,900
each one had been a
dynamo of a human spirit,

922
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:05,100
hope and ambition.
Now they were still there,

923
01:01:05,101 --> 01:01:07,590
emotion frozen at least,

924
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:13,040
and that last incident of life as if
making a mockery of the final effort.

925
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:19,170
They had become meaningless
clumps of earth forever inanimate,

926
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:23,160
no more significant than the rocks
lying to their left and right.

927
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,270
How fickle those human
ambitions now seemed,

928
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:29,610
how pointless those concerns

929
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:35,920
and just as the bodies had become part
of the earth on which they rested.

930
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:41,640
So I had passed during the battle from
being in the war to being part of the

931
01:01:43,721 --> 01:01:44,554
war.

932
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:50,563
Okay.

933
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:57,900
Continuing on the fog of war is pervasive.

934
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:00,030
As vigilant as I tried to be,

935
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,270
I knew it was only a matter of
time before a mistake was made.

936
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:08,460
There were six squads to control as well
as the Armored Cavalry platoon and the

937
01:02:08,461 --> 01:02:12,090
still disjointed RF gaggle.
Moreover,

938
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:17,160
Vietnamese regular army units were
infringing on my area as platoon leader.

939
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:20,220
I had the problems of the rich,

940
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:24,180
too many resources to coordinate
in a limited area of operations,

941
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:27,810
the ingredients for a tragedy or brewing,

942
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:31,470
and so he had been augmented
with more with some cavalry guys,

943
01:02:31,471 --> 01:02:34,160
with more platoons or started
more squads to help mount.

944
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:39,000
So now he's got a bunch of people there.
He had 30 before. Now he's got a lot more

945
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:43,620
and there's patrols are happening.

946
01:02:43,621 --> 01:02:48,621
Things are going on and we start getting
a call of potential enemy [inaudible]

947
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:56,420
outside the wire and he's checking his
map and he's giving you the going back

948
01:02:57,721 --> 01:03:00,360
and forth on the radio. Hey, isn't it
we have any friendlies in that location?

949
01:03:00,361 --> 01:03:02,550
Nope. No friendlies there.
Check with the other guys. Nope.

950
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:05,130
We had no friendlies there.
So no one's in that area? No,

951
01:03:05,131 --> 01:03:07,920
there's no friendlies in that area.
Okay. God, he's checking his map.

952
01:03:07,921 --> 01:03:10,590
He's going back and forth and
now we go back to the book.

953
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:16,080
All checks had been made. The squad
still had the moving element in sight.

954
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:21,270
The decision was now mine,
take them under fire with the sniper,

955
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:23,910
then open up,
shoot to kill.

956
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,620
The last statement seemed pointless.
We always shot to kill,

957
01:03:28,621 --> 01:03:31,650
but it reflected my troubled
thoughts over the risk I was taking.

958
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,680
The enemy just did not go that way,

959
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:39,060
but no friendlies were reported anywhere
near us. It had to be the enemy.

960
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,620
So here's the one shot with sniper.

961
01:03:42,621 --> 01:03:45,050
Go out and then he hears
massive gunfire go out.

962
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,650
You can probably tell
where this is heading.

963
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:53,480
And then a frantic voice scream from my
radio, cease fire, cease fire, my God,

964
01:03:53,481 --> 01:03:54,530
you're killing us.

965
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:00,110
I was horrified as I grabbed the handset
and barked my order to one to one.

966
01:04:00,111 --> 01:04:02,370
This is two six ceasefire over.

967
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:07,220
They had heard the original plea and
even as I spoke, the Malay quieted,

968
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:08,520
okay

969
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:12,540
again, the radio spoke you sons of
bitches, they're dead, they're dead.

970
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:20,740
So in the confusion in the fog of war,

971
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:24,370
they'd seen some guys and obviously they
turned out to be friendlies and they

972
01:04:24,371 --> 01:04:25,204
engaged him.

973
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:30,040
Over the next 30 minutes they get
the debrief of what's happening.

974
01:04:30,041 --> 01:04:33,190
It was an American advisor was out
there with a Vietnamese platoon,

975
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,910
one of his guys were dead
and two were badly wounded.

976
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:43,200
And here's how we felt about that.

977
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:47,910
I had ordered the execution of those men
because the lieutenant advisor had made

978
01:04:47,911 --> 01:04:51,390
a mistake by the way,
they were 2,500 meters off course.

979
01:04:51,391 --> 01:04:54,120
So they should not have been in that area.
And when they were hearing,

980
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:56,400
they were hearing on the radio, hey,
is there any friendlies out there?

981
01:04:56,401 --> 01:04:59,070
And they thought there's no way that
anyone could be talking to us right now,

982
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:06,710
but it happens and a man should not
be condemned to death for it in war.

983
01:05:07,051 --> 01:05:11,790
However, the price from
mistakes is dear and terribly.

984
01:05:11,791 --> 01:05:16,791
Final military leaders must weigh affects
of their decisions carefully before

985
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:21,730
because usually
there is no turning back.

986
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:22,753
Okay.

987
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:31,900
Uh, that, that blue on
blue, that fratricide thing,

988
01:05:31,901 --> 01:05:35,830
it's a real thing. It's a real
thing. I've lived through it myself.

989
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:37,360
I've been in charge of
when it's happening,

990
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:41,350
it's awful and it's real.

991
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:47,020
And so everybody that's out there,
that's soldiers,

992
01:05:47,021 --> 01:05:52,000
marines, special ops guys,
train for that. Get that.

993
01:05:52,001 --> 01:05:54,100
Make yourselves as can
make your leadership,

994
01:05:54,101 --> 01:05:58,750
make everyone is confused as you can
is what's happening so that you force

995
01:05:58,751 --> 01:06:03,751
yourselves to think and understand
and over communicate where people are,

996
01:06:04,121 --> 01:06:06,580
what positions they're going to,
what positions they're leaving,

997
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:11,200
who's where on the battlefield.
The fog of war is no joke.

998
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:12,123
Cool.

999
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:20,220
Now there's another attack that they,

1000
01:06:20,221 --> 01:06:24,600
that they pushed back and they
kind of Ford it early on by,

1001
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:29,130
by catching someone that was going to,

1002
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:32,670
that was inside there was going to
try and get inside their compound.

1003
01:06:32,671 --> 01:06:36,000
They catch that person,
and here we go to the book.

1004
01:06:36,001 --> 01:06:39,270
They're planning must have been to rupture
our defense with a tremendous blast

1005
01:06:39,271 --> 01:06:43,260
from the ammunition bunker and then rush
it us from the eastern flank with the

1006
01:06:43,261 --> 01:06:46,470
five sappers.
While we were still dazed,

1007
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:50,700
the sappers were armed only
with fragmentation grenades,

1008
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:56,070
but they had plenty of them. Later we
took 49 grenades from their bodies.

1009
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,540
One of the sappers,

1010
01:06:57,541 --> 01:07:02,541
a young muscular man who in life would've
epitomize the propaganda stereotype of

1011
01:07:02,581 --> 01:07:07,440
a revolutionary, but who in depth
appeared like so much wasted.

1012
01:07:07,441 --> 01:07:12,441
Clay was dressed only in a loin cloth
folded within that single article of

1013
01:07:14,371 --> 01:07:19,110
clothing was a small piece of paper upon
which was drawn a rough but accurate

1014
01:07:19,111 --> 01:07:21,480
sketch of our perimeter defense.

1015
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:26,290
The first link in their plan had
been destroyed by the capture of the

1016
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:27,124
infiltrator,

1017
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:31,630
and it was further deteriorated by
the annihilation of the Sapper Force.

1018
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:37,540
But the Viet Cong were never noted for
their flexibility and they continued to

1019
01:07:37,541 --> 01:07:40,840
press forward according to
their original plan. However,

1020
01:07:40,841 --> 01:07:44,260
instead of meeting days dying
and demoralized defenders,

1021
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,660
the enemy rushed right
into the protective fires,

1022
01:07:46,661 --> 01:07:51,661
have already enabled platoon because of
a slight twist of fortune over which the

1023
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:53,170
Viet Cong had no influence.

1024
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:58,470
The attackers went to their death
rather than to victory that night.

1025
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:01,740
So this is the second time
we've heard that is just there.

1026
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:05,170
The Viet Cong not being very flexible,

1027
01:08:05,171 --> 01:08:09,610
not being very adaptable with their plan.
So once again,

1028
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,590
if you're in a leadership position,

1029
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:15,100
did you gotta you gotta maintain
flexibility with your plan,

1030
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:17,840
whether you're in a combat operation
or whether you're in a business world,

1031
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:19,243
it doesn't matter.

1032
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:24,230
Maintaining flexibility is absolutely
paramount in from a leadership perspective

1033
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:26,060
and from a team perspective.
Hmm.

1034
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:34,730
Now they're,
after that attack,

1035
01:08:34,731 --> 01:08:38,780
they move out to go for a counter attack,
which is,

1036
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:43,160
which is just, I mean, let's, let's think
about this. You're in your perimeter,

1037
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:45,240
you get attacked their date.

1038
01:08:45,290 --> 01:08:50,090
They had a person that infiltrated and
almost made it into the main ammo bunker

1039
01:08:50,091 --> 01:08:52,100
that you have.
They almost blew that up.

1040
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:54,800
And then their second thing was
to have these, these sappers,

1041
01:08:54,801 --> 01:08:59,801
these the soldiers crawling through the
wire with 40 something grenades with

1042
01:09:00,291 --> 01:09:05,000
them to go and Jack stuff up. You
push back, you repel this attack,

1043
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:08,000
and then guess what? The time for
a cap type for a counter attack.

1044
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:13,190
So here he is as the script back to the
book as a squad lined up for the exit

1045
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:13,761
through the wire,

1046
01:09:13,761 --> 01:09:17,930
I looked at their young faces tightened
to stifle the fear building up inside

1047
01:09:17,931 --> 01:09:20,720
their bodies.
They were barely men,

1048
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:25,580
yet called upon by their country and
abandoned by their more well to do peers,

1049
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:29,960
about to face a ruthless enemy who
meant to put them in their early grave.

1050
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:34,130
No words of complaint from any of them.

1051
01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:39,590
They were American infantry men and
would do the job they were asked to do.

1052
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:43,940
No matter what. No matter that
it would not be appreciated,

1053
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:46,380
no matter that they would be
condemned by their countrymen,

1054
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:50,930
or at least the countryman with the
ability to wear with all to mold public

1055
01:09:50,931 --> 01:09:54,110
opinion tonight.
They would do their duty,

1056
01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:58,700
though they were little more than
boys though. They were frightened,

1057
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:03,260
though they were most not ready to die.
They would do their duty.

1058
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:04,700
Okay.

1059
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:09,700
Most of them were labeled as coming
from the lower social strata of American

1060
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:13,580
society as if that were
something in noble.

1061
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:14,980
Yeah.

1062
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:18,730
I felt proud to be with them
and glad to share their company,

1063
01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:22,420
their qualities of moral
and physical courage,

1064
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:25,270
of unselfish dedication to each other.

1065
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:30,340
Amid the difficult jobs they were
called upon to do. Mark them in my mind,

1066
01:10:30,341 --> 01:10:33,790
is among the noblest of human beings.

1067
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:39,193
Yeah.

1068
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:43,110
So they're out on this counter
attack. I mean, what a,

1069
01:10:43,111 --> 01:10:45,690
what a great tribute to
the American soldier.

1070
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:48,950
Unbelievable.

1071
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:54,530
Unbelievable dedication and pride.

1072
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:57,080
Unbelievable men.

1073
01:10:59,450 --> 01:10:59,850
Yeah.

1074
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:03,810
Now they,
they're patrolling out in front of them.

1075
01:11:03,811 --> 01:11:07,890
They hear some whispers and whispers
out in front of them where they're

1076
01:11:07,891 --> 01:11:12,660
patrolling towards and
they're trying to figure out what to do.

1077
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:17,550
And it sounds like, um,
McDonald's sorta saying, Hey,

1078
01:11:17,551 --> 01:11:19,890
let's just kill these guys.
There's bad guys up ahead.

1079
01:11:19,891 --> 01:11:24,891
We're wearing out the whispering and
Killigan tugs at his arm and says,

1080
01:11:25,021 --> 01:11:29,490
stay here. Like I'm going to go
check this out. He basically says,

1081
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:33,690
you know, um, we shouldn't, we
shouldn't kill these people.

1082
01:11:35,310 --> 01:11:40,310
And he McDonald gets kind of
pissed because he's thinking,

1083
01:11:41,041 --> 01:11:44,940
look, this isn't the time for us to debate
right now. I want to make a decision.

1084
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:48,660
And he says, kill again.

1085
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:54,600
In one of his rare moments of speech, he
has taught me, let me check it out first.

1086
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:56,970
So Killigan doesn't talk much.
He's gets it done.

1087
01:11:58,950 --> 01:12:03,300
So he creeps forward, you know, and,
and he was basically saying, look,

1088
01:12:03,301 --> 01:12:06,300
I'm going to go on alone. Like, are
you just let me take my chances?

1089
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:11,370
I'm not putting anybody else
at risk. No, just me. And so
he decides, okay, go ahead.

1090
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,020
You want to take you
on a risk of your life.

1091
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:18,960
And so he Killigan disappears into the
darkness and then a little while later he

1092
01:12:18,961 --> 01:12:21,480
comes back. It's cool. And
we'll go to the book here.

1093
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:25,500
Then as quietly as he had crept away,
Killigan reappeared from the darkness.

1094
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:29,790
He crawled up to my face and
said, it's okay. Let's move on.

1095
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,580
What were the voices?
I asked?

1096
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:36,210
Family was his one word response.

1097
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:40,230
I passed the word to hold fire
and the file began moving.

1098
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:44,730
We moved out of position and through the
brush to our front there huddled in a

1099
01:12:44,731 --> 01:12:47,790
hole that must have been used
as a household garbage dump.

1100
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:50,790
We're two aged women and old man,

1101
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:53,610
one young woman and four tiny children.

1102
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:58,110
The elderly people had shy,
embarrassed, smiles on their faces.

1103
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:03,210
The children's stared in sheer
terror. Well, they might.

1104
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:05,250
I had nearly killed them.

1105
01:13:05,251 --> 01:13:09,210
All the side of the family was haunting.

1106
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:16,730
I and others like me are trained and
commissioned to lead men into actions that

1107
01:13:16,951 --> 01:13:21,951
determine the life and death are authority
particularly on the field of battle

1108
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:24,270
is virtually unquestioned.

1109
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:30,320
We were tasked to men to lead men like
Killigan to tell them what should be done

1110
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:35,970
and what they must do. We
have no obligation to listen
to their point of view.

1111
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:38,010
Indeed to do so.

1112
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:42,450
Might be in itself or cause to occur,

1113
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:44,250
a failure of leadership.

1114
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:50,660
And yet the American soldier is often
much more prepared than his leader to make

1115
01:13:51,151 --> 01:13:53,190
a sound determination
of what should be done.

1116
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:56,970
Gilligan's approach had
been wiser than mine.

1117
01:13:57,090 --> 01:14:00,840
I was too preoccupied with my own safety
and the safety of my men to consider

1118
01:14:00,841 --> 01:14:03,180
that there might have been
a noncombatants in the area.

1119
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:08,760
I had come to the most basic of
battlefields strategies shoot now and ask

1120
01:14:08,761 --> 01:14:11,650
questions later.
1,000 times.

1121
01:14:11,651 --> 01:14:15,100
I might've been able to rationalize
that course of action after the fact,

1122
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:19,360
but I had gone.
But had I gone ahead this time,

1123
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:21,970
the people huddled now
whole would have been dead,

1124
01:14:22,210 --> 01:14:27,210
nothing but rotting corpses by the heat
of the next day that they were alive was

1125
01:14:27,431 --> 01:14:28,540
no thanks to me.

1126
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:35,040
It was to kill against credit and he
was just a quote lowly American infantry

1127
01:14:37,271 --> 01:14:42,230
men.
So once again,

1128
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:47,320
just credit to the trooper,
to the soldier and, and,

1129
01:14:47,321 --> 01:14:48,320
and you can see there's,

1130
01:14:48,321 --> 01:14:52,850
this is some of the things that he talked
about that we have no obligation to

1131
01:14:52,851 --> 01:14:53,960
listen to their point of view,

1132
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:58,910
that that's something that you can see
he's maturing out of, right? And He,

1133
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:03,940
this paragraph is a visible
evidence of him transitioning from,

1134
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:07,850
hey look, I'm, I'm the boss, I'm in
charge. Do what I say to you know what?

1135
01:15:07,851 --> 01:15:11,810
These guys know better than I do
in many cases. And that's from,

1136
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,720
from a leadership perspective,
that's a very important lesson to learn.

1137
01:15:14,721 --> 01:15:16,550
And the sooner you learn it,
the better off you're going to be.

1138
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:21,290
The people that you're leading
oftentimes know the situation, the job,

1139
01:15:21,291 --> 01:15:23,600
the technicalities better than you do.

1140
01:15:24,890 --> 01:15:29,610
So rely on them, count on
them, ask their opinion. And,

1141
01:15:29,611 --> 01:15:32,660
and the fact of the matter is,
when you don't ask their opinion,

1142
01:15:32,690 --> 01:15:37,340
it's only because you're insecure
about your leadership ability and your

1143
01:15:37,341 --> 01:15:38,174
position.

1144
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:42,440
And by not asking you actually

1145
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:45,470
you actually

1146
01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:50,810
develop less respect than if
you say, Hey, you know what?

1147
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:54,770
Killigan you've been here,
this is your third tour in Vietnam.

1148
01:15:55,010 --> 01:15:56,600
What do you think we should do here?

1149
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:00,020
You will not lose respect leaders.

1150
01:16:00,021 --> 01:16:03,830
You will not lose respect if you
asked that question. In fact,

1151
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:08,180
you lose respect when you don't respect
your frontline trooper when you don't

1152
01:16:08,181 --> 01:16:11,270
use their talent, when you don't
take advantage of their expertise,

1153
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:13,100
that's when you go backwards.

1154
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:16,640
Listen to your troopers,

1155
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,600
so he gets,

1156
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:30,170
he gets pulled back to command.

1157
01:16:30,230 --> 01:16:35,230
They assigned him to like a mixed match
unit of a bunch of random squads because

1158
01:16:36,261 --> 01:16:41,261
they have a certain mission that they
want them to do and they've gone out and

1159
01:16:41,841 --> 01:16:44,760
they've set up a perimeter and if you
don't want a security perimeter is

1160
01:16:44,761 --> 01:16:47,750
basically 360 degree security
perimeter of where your,

1161
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:51,230
you have guns pointed to
the outside and you have,

1162
01:16:51,231 --> 01:16:54,380
usually the leadership will be in the
center of the perimeter and there'll be

1163
01:16:54,381 --> 01:16:57,800
small teams kind of out in the
perimeter making up the progress.

1164
01:16:57,801 --> 01:16:59,030
That's the position that they're in.

1165
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:03,920
He's got these random squads that he's
never worked with before and he's in

1166
01:17:03,921 --> 01:17:07,910
charge of them again. This is a,
this is something where, you know,

1167
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:10,310
we we did have to work with
on my last appointment.

1168
01:17:10,311 --> 01:17:13,820
Oftentimes you're working with other
seals. These are the guys, you know, guys,

1169
01:17:13,821 --> 01:17:14,541
you know him really well.

1170
01:17:14,541 --> 01:17:16,730
You know everything that they're going
to do and here you are getting thrown

1171
01:17:16,731 --> 01:17:20,480
into a combat environment on a very
dangerous patrol into enemy territory that

1172
01:17:20,481 --> 01:17:22,790
you don't know very well and you've got
a bunch of guys that you never worked

1173
01:17:22,791 --> 01:17:23,624
with before.

1174
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:28,430
So as he's in that perimeter,

1175
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:34,520
he's given the guys some instructions
about something called challenge and

1176
01:17:34,521 --> 01:17:35,061
replies.

1177
01:17:35,061 --> 01:17:38,180
So it's a way of confirming cause it's
pitch black and these guys don't have

1178
01:17:38,181 --> 01:17:41,540
nightmares and it's pitch black. He says,
hey if you, if you hear someone coming,

1179
01:17:41,541 --> 01:17:46,541
you can issue the challenge for a number
of some of 10 which is like if I say

1180
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:49,460
echo or if I hear you
coming and I say seven,

1181
01:17:50,050 --> 01:17:53,840
you would respond three if I say for
you would respond six. So they've,

1182
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:57,260
they've passed that word. If you
hear noise, you need to challenge,

1183
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:58,550
do that challenge and reply.

1184
01:17:58,730 --> 01:18:03,710
So he's out there and he's crawling
towards one of the little elements on the

1185
01:18:03,711 --> 01:18:06,650
outside of the perimeter so he can
find out, you know, check in with them,

1186
01:18:06,651 --> 01:18:08,720
see if they've seen anything,
see if they heard anything.

1187
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,660
And here we go back to the book.

1188
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:15,410
She was his only warning to the others.

1189
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:20,270
I came to a complete rest waiting
for someone to issue the challenge.

1190
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:23,570
The seconds ticked on,
but I heard no sound.

1191
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,180
I began to sense there was a problem.

1192
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:32,060
The next sound was the bolt and firing
pin of a rifle sliding forward in

1193
01:18:32,061 --> 01:18:34,010
response to a pull trigger.

1194
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,960
Both fell forward on an empty chamber.
Terrified.

1195
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:42,740
I realized that I should be dead,
that the rifleman meant to nail me.

1196
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:44,420
No questions asked,

1197
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:49,160
only is earlier error and not
having chambered around saved me.

1198
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:52,970
Don't shoot. I shouted at
heart. It's the lieutenant,

1199
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:56,990
but I was too late to stop
the momentum of events.

1200
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:01,460
I heard a panicky remark from the midst
of the group get the bastards that

1201
01:19:01,461 --> 01:19:05,150
around was chambered.
As I flung myself at the sound.

1202
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:09,290
15 feet is not far to sprint,
but the journey seem to endless.

1203
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:14,240
I threw myself parallel to the ground
and lunged in the dark figure appearing

1204
01:19:14,241 --> 01:19:17,090
before my eyes.
As I launched through the year,

1205
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:20,630
I felt round switched
by my outstretched body,

1206
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:24,680
nine or 10 bullets burning out of
the barrel of the automatic weapon.

1207
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:29,090
My arms circled the needs of the
fire or bringing him down in a heap.

1208
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:33,710
I purse the hop barrels skyward as the
last of the rounds exited the weapon.

1209
01:19:34,490 --> 01:19:36,110
Although I had pinned the fire,

1210
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:40,010
I had also to think about the two
other men with him. I yelled out,

1211
01:19:40,011 --> 01:19:42,470
don't shoot you son of a bitch.
It's the platoon leader.

1212
01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:47,150
There was no further firing.
Fighting my rage.

1213
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:52,010
I tried to focus my thoughts. We
were in deep trouble. Don't shoot,

1214
01:19:52,011 --> 01:19:56,660
don't shoot, don't shoot. I shot. I hold
your fire. I shouted across the perimeter.

1215
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:01,430
I could hear nervous chatter from
all around so he barely escaped.

1216
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:05,480
He gets the guys to stop.
He doesn't even really,

1217
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,190
he's mad,

1218
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:12,230
but he's basically taking responsibility
in being in this situation in the first

1219
01:20:13,741 --> 01:20:15,810
place.
So

1220
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:19,380
he says to the guys that were there,
he says,

1221
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:22,740
I admonished all three men to challenge
correctly speaking to them as if I were

1222
01:20:22,741 --> 01:20:25,440
giving a clap classroom
instructions to a bunch of eager,

1223
01:20:25,441 --> 01:20:29,790
if not very bright students.
I surprised myself with my calmness.

1224
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:34,440
It was when I moved back to my position
that the greatest struggle within me

1225
01:20:34,441 --> 01:20:39,420
began. Perhaps it was triggered by the
decision I had to make by the book.

1226
01:20:39,421 --> 01:20:44,190
I shifted.
I had shifted our positions by the book.

1227
01:20:44,191 --> 01:20:48,030
I should have shifted our positions.
We were reconnaissance patrol.

1228
01:20:48,330 --> 01:20:53,330
We were badly outnumbered by the enemy
and had compromised our position with all

1229
01:20:53,551 --> 01:20:57,480
the shooting and shouting.
There were good reasons for moving.

1230
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:00,450
On the other hand,
it was pitch black night.

1231
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:03,900
If the enemy was close enough
to get an immediate fix on us,

1232
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:08,640
he was close enough to hit us before
we could move. Even if he wasn't close.

1233
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:12,210
Further stumbling around in the
darkness might worsen our predicament.

1234
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,230
Moreover,
to effect the movement,

1235
01:21:16,231 --> 01:21:19,350
I would have to move around
to regroup the disbursed men.

1236
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,920
This was the point that weighed
most heavily on my mind.

1237
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:25,290
I no longer had the heart for it.

1238
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:28,320
I had come within an inch of being killed,

1239
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:32,250
shot by one of my own man on the side of
an ink black mountain in the middle of

1240
01:21:32,251 --> 01:21:33,084
nowhere.

1241
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:37,500
I knew the men were ready
to shoot anything that moves
and I didn't want to give

1242
01:21:37,501 --> 01:21:42,270
them a target.
I should have been ashamed of myself.

1243
01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:43,890
I was too afraid to move,

1244
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:47,580
to implement what was probably the
best course of action for my men and my

1245
01:21:47,581 --> 01:21:50,280
mission.
I couldn't do it naked.

1246
01:21:50,281 --> 01:21:53,790
Fear stripped me of all shame or guilt.

1247
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:57,480
Fear was all I knew and
I didn't want to move.

1248
01:21:57,990 --> 01:22:02,280
A few moments earlier, I had been an
effective platoon leader doing his job.

1249
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:06,570
Now I could actually feel my chest
throbbing against the dirt where I lay.

1250
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:10,830
I wanted to bury my face in my hands.
I wanted to be like the little boy.

1251
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:14,550
I used to be hiding from the darkness
by putting his head under the covers.

1252
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:19,380
I could not think.
My big body began to tremble than shiver,

1253
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:22,410
then shake uncontrollably.
My God, I was going to die.

1254
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:27,030
I could not possibly live through the
night. If anyone heard my breathing,

1255
01:22:27,031 --> 01:22:30,690
I was sure you'd kill me. Death
was everywhere. I had sensed it,

1256
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:35,430
felt it lying down beside me.
I didn't want to die,

1257
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:38,010
but death was there.
Cold and clammy,

1258
01:22:38,130 --> 01:22:42,420
reaching for me with his icy touch,
my pulse,

1259
01:22:42,421 --> 01:22:45,180
pounding in my ears and I felt nauseous.

1260
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:50,010
I almost threw up the passing minutes,
hours,

1261
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:53,760
whatever units of time exist in
a nightmare, brought no relief.

1262
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:59,880
The fear only worsened. I would not live
through the night. I was sure of it.

1263
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:05,070
With the dying hurt.
I wondered would I disappear into

1264
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:10,090
when I first went, prone trying
to press myself into the ground,

1265
01:23:10,091 --> 01:23:12,400
I fell close to an ant hill.

1266
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:16,270
A few of the ants scouts immediately
began a reconnaissance of my body,

1267
01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:20,920
but it was not until the ants legions
were called forward that I noticed them.

1268
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:24,070
As I lay shaking on the ground,

1269
01:23:24,071 --> 01:23:28,720
thousands of ants began trooping
over me adding to the crawling,

1270
01:23:28,721 --> 01:23:31,840
feeling on my flesh.
Still,

1271
01:23:31,841 --> 01:23:36,610
I did not move for the move I knew
would put me in the embrace of death,

1272
01:23:36,910 --> 01:23:41,650
so I laid there where I was. Heart
pounding, skin sweating, ears throbbing.

1273
01:23:41,770 --> 01:23:45,520
While an army of ants probed
and pricked up at my will.

1274
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:52,660
Sometime later that night, the rains came
in, a torrential downpour, that Santa,

1275
01:23:52,661 --> 01:23:56,630
a stream gushing down the mountain
side at us. I still didn't move.

1276
01:23:57,290 --> 01:24:01,850
My night of terror was not over yet and
when the rain stopped, after a few hours,

1277
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:05,000
I still lay in the ooze and slime

1278
01:24:06,890 --> 01:24:08,900
firstlight brought a sense of recovery.

1279
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:12,500
Darkness was ending and I was still alive.

1280
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:17,000
Only then did the
beating of my heart slow.

1281
01:24:17,930 --> 01:24:19,010
I loosened my belt,

1282
01:24:19,011 --> 01:24:23,720
reached down into the soggy elastic of
my undershorts and wiped out a streak of

1283
01:24:23,721 --> 01:24:25,160
drowned ants.

1284
01:24:26,330 --> 01:24:30,400
The rains had swept them over my body
where they'd become trapped and they had

1285
01:24:30,410 --> 01:24:34,700
drowned.
As I removed their dead bodies,

1286
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:39,500
thousands of them, I seem to rid
myself of my fixation with death.

1287
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:44,300
I had lived through the
night vulnerable as I was.

1288
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:48,530
The answer died imminently
adaptable as they were.

1289
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:52,670
Somehow the irony of it reassured me,

1290
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:57,020
one died when it was time to die.

1291
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:01,510
Apparently it was not my time.

1292
01:25:02,850 --> 01:25:03,380
Okay.

1293
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:05,900
As dawn broke,
I pulled myself together,

1294
01:25:05,990 --> 01:25:10,990
gathered up my makeshift patrol and move
back toward the ranger camp that night

1295
01:25:11,421 --> 01:25:14,570
on the mountain.
Instead of engaging the enemy,

1296
01:25:14,571 --> 01:25:17,300
I'd come to grips with my own mortality.

1297
01:25:19,010 --> 01:25:21,770
That night I had been a
terrible platoon leader,

1298
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:27,500
but perhaps I would be a better
one thereafter because of it.

1299
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:35,180
Little bit of an intense evening
for lieutenant mcdonough.

1300
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:41,960
Unbelievable.
Now he gets some,

1301
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:48,710
and throughout this book there's,
and I talked about this in the beginning,

1302
01:25:48,711 --> 01:25:52,670
that there's rotations of guys in,
guys are getting wounded guys,

1303
01:25:52,671 --> 01:25:54,860
it's time for them to go home,
so you're constantly,

1304
01:25:54,861 --> 01:25:57,020
he's constantly getting new troopers.

1305
01:25:57,620 --> 01:26:02,620
New soldiers knew noncommissioned officers
that are going to be the senior guys,

1306
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:08,420
the platoon, and it's just, it's just
a constant stream of incoming new guys,

1307
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:13,400
which again is very foreign to me because
in the seal teams we do very little of

1308
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:13,670
that.

1309
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:18,560
We do do it sometimes for guy graduated
seal training and they happened to be

1310
01:26:18,561 --> 01:26:22,670
assigned a team that's on deployment.
They, they might come over and join,

1311
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:26,390
join us on deployment. It can't happen,
but it's not, it's not the norm.

1312
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:33,880
So he's got a new guy that shows up who's
a staff sergeant and empowerment and

1313
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:39,620
power admins like almost 40 years old.
He'd crossed the Canadian border,

1314
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:41,240
um,
are uh,

1315
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:45,650
the Canadian border to
join the Canadian army

1316
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:51,180
and he'd spent time in the
British army and Cyprus.

1317
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:55,790
He'd been chasing war basically,
and it's slightly under six feet tall,

1318
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:59,990
not an ounce of fat on his lien frame.
Determined Look,

1319
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:04,160
and this is quite contrary to the
guys he had been working with.

1320
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:08,060
And here he talks about that a little
bit with Hernandez and Robinson.

1321
01:27:08,061 --> 01:27:11,660
I had to push to get them
patrolling with Palamon.

1322
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:13,550
I had to hold him back.

1323
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:19,100
He believed firmly that the only
good defense was it good or fence.

1324
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:22,070
And he was ready to set
the example every day.

1325
01:27:22,790 --> 01:27:26,030
Not only did he take himself out on
as many patrols is I would permit.

1326
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:28,730
He invariably pushed seated
to the front of the column,

1327
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:31,610
eventually threatening to
displace the point. Man.

1328
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:37,720
He exhibited such enthusiasm when he and
I went on longer patrols that I had to

1329
01:27:38,451 --> 01:27:42,020
order them back to the back of the column,
lest I find myself trailing him.

1330
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:47,480
He never met disrespect. He just wanted
to be up front where the action might be.

1331
01:27:48,710 --> 01:27:49,170
Okay.

1332
01:27:49,170 --> 01:27:51,570
Newman was the perfect platoon sergeant.

1333
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:57,010
Okay.

1334
01:27:57,010 --> 01:28:01,980
You're definitely blessed when you get it,

1335
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:04,710
when you get a leader
like that in your command,

1336
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:09,330
and I was definitely lucky enough to
serve with many guys with that kind of

1337
01:28:09,331 --> 01:28:12,030
attitude that I had to hold back.

1338
01:28:14,650 --> 01:28:14,860
Okay.

1339
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:19,180
Here's an interesting thing.
Um, he says during the war,

1340
01:28:19,181 --> 01:28:23,230
we lost approximately 10,000 men too,
other than enemy fire.

1341
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:27,370
Vietnam was so full of treachery
danger and outright bad luck,

1342
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:28,273
okay.

1343
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:33,860
That he's on this administrative
mission and he just like playing it safe

1344
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,610
because he doesn't want to die.

1345
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:39,290
I want to get killed by a criminal
or getting a car accident.

1346
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:43,400
But you don't think about 10,000 people
die in Vietnam just from other than

1347
01:28:43,401 --> 01:28:44,110
combat.

1348
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:44,943
Hmm.

1349
01:28:48,030 --> 01:28:50,910
The heavy rain to discourage the
enemy from moving against us.

1350
01:28:52,270 --> 01:28:53,103
Okay.

1351
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:54,210
That was some comfort.

1352
01:28:54,211 --> 01:28:58,620
Obviously they were human after all too
often they seem to above the constraints

1353
01:28:58,621 --> 01:29:02,610
of normal men, too hardened to the
rigors that wore down the rest of us.

1354
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:05,910
Although it was tempting
to rest on our haunches,

1355
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:08,730
taking advantage of the real
spite offered by the weather.

1356
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:13,530
I knew that in the long run it would
be safer to push more on the offensive.

1357
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:18,420
To lie back would only allow the
enemy to build their strength.

1358
01:29:18,690 --> 01:29:23,690
As I was building mine and allow them
to choose the time and place of the next

1359
01:29:24,241 --> 01:29:28,650
strike,
I decided to go after them in their layer.

1360
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:34,230
One of the personnel changes I made was
to take Killigan out of his squad leader

1361
01:29:34,231 --> 01:29:38,130
position. Uh, sergeant arrived
to take over the squad.

1362
01:29:38,310 --> 01:29:41,130
I password to him to
keep Killigan off point.

1363
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:44,970
Killigan did not like it and was
close to the point of rebellion,

1364
01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:48,840
but I refuse to put them back on point.
His luck was about to run out.

1365
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:51,030
No matter how good he might be,

1366
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:55,260
the odds are heavily stacked
against the point man. My order,

1367
01:29:55,261 --> 01:30:00,240
however meant little in variably
Gilligan would move up to the front,

1368
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:03,570
always out there,
a little advance of the moving element.

1369
01:30:04,290 --> 01:30:07,350
It was a role he defined for himself.

1370
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:12,150
So obviously we're going to continue to,

1371
01:30:12,390 --> 01:30:15,810
one of the themes of this book is be
aggressive and stay on the offense.

1372
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,550
That's absolutely true.

1373
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:21,300
The reason I highlighted that thing with
Killigan was because here you've got a

1374
01:30:21,301 --> 01:30:23,490
guy that's all about good
order and discipline,

1375
01:30:24,090 --> 01:30:26,810
but guess what he's telling Killigan
don't walk point, don't walk point,

1376
01:30:26,820 --> 01:30:29,790
don't walk point and kill him. Good
and goes, okay. Yeah I won't walk.

1377
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:33,020
Point goes out on patrol,
goes up to point, and that's,

1378
01:30:33,021 --> 01:30:36,270
that's also one of those things where,
you know, sometimes I get asked, you know,

1379
01:30:36,271 --> 01:30:39,000
my boss is not doing this or
we're not getting, we're getting,

1380
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:42,150
we're not getting clear direction,
or I don't agree with this thing.

1381
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:45,570
Sometimes you've got to make
some stuff happen, you know,

1382
01:30:45,571 --> 01:30:48,540
especially if it's the right thing to do.
You got to make some stuff happen.

1383
01:30:48,541 --> 01:30:52,830
Sometimes.
Now they do some,

1384
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:58,250
some operations and they're starting
to take some toll on the enemy.

1385
01:31:00,980 --> 01:31:02,130
And here's what the enemy does.

1386
01:31:02,220 --> 01:31:06,660
The enemy retaliatory retaliated with
more booby traps and other regular

1387
01:31:06,661 --> 01:31:08,400
attacks.
One morning,

1388
01:31:08,401 --> 01:31:12,720
the village chief was caught at the
well as he bathed his ever present.

1389
01:31:12,721 --> 01:31:14,910
40 45 caliber pistol,

1390
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:17,760
left a few feet away
with his pile of clothes,

1391
01:31:18,850 --> 01:31:23,520
a small nine year old boy,
no doubt acting on orders from a relative.

1392
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:28,620
Walked up, smiled and shot the chief
twice with a 22 caliber pistol.

1393
01:31:29,820 --> 01:31:32,310
Once again, however, the chief survived.

1394
01:31:32,311 --> 01:31:37,311
Returning a few weeks later to resume
his post specialists Barnes back from six

1395
01:31:37,831 --> 01:31:41,370
days in Australia, stepped on a booby
trap and lost his right leg at the hip.

1396
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:42,601
Robson,

1397
01:31:42,601 --> 01:31:47,090
the nervous baby kid from Illinois who
had arrived with Palamon got wedged head

1398
01:31:47,091 --> 01:31:51,720
first and a Vietcong tunnel. As
he was clearing it, he panicked,

1399
01:31:52,230 --> 01:31:56,430
vomited and drowned in his own puke
before he could be pulled back out.

1400
01:31:57,540 --> 01:31:59,250
Another man recently arrived,

1401
01:31:59,470 --> 01:32:03,610
sat down beside a trail to take a break
and trip the Chinese claim or with his,

1402
01:32:03,611 --> 01:32:07,780
but I hope that his mother would
not ask to open his coffin.

1403
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:13,480
The gruesome toll of the
booby traps war on our nerves,

1404
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:15,190
no matter how many we found,

1405
01:32:15,191 --> 01:32:18,040
we knew there were others out
there waiting for a misstep.

1406
01:32:18,790 --> 01:32:22,600
The terror built it is one thing to
rush an enemy in battle and take your

1407
01:32:22,601 --> 01:32:26,050
chances in the face of his fire power.
The experience is frightening,

1408
01:32:26,051 --> 01:32:28,840
but the momentum of the
act compels you forward,

1409
01:32:28,841 --> 01:32:31,690
sparing you the agony of
considering your predicament,

1410
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:37,540
thinking your way through a booby trap
areas completely different experience and

1411
01:32:37,541 --> 01:32:41,290
much more horrifying.
Moving along.

1412
01:32:41,291 --> 01:32:44,500
You suddenly notice a freshly
smooth spot of dirt to your front.

1413
01:32:44,501 --> 01:32:49,460
You look hard and see the three deadly
prongs of the anti-personnel mind come

1414
01:32:49,461 --> 01:32:53,770
into focus and unholy trinity extending
from beneath the surface of the earth to

1415
01:32:53,771 --> 01:32:56,200
greet your foot,
fall and rip you apart.

1416
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,150
You look to your right and see
a pile of rocks are intertwined.

1417
01:33:01,150 --> 01:33:04,960
Twigs the Vietcong warning to their
own that this is a killing ground.

1418
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:07,300
You order everyone to freeze.

1419
01:33:07,301 --> 01:33:10,150
As you strain your eyes to
pick out more booby trap clues,

1420
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:12,910
your nerves have turned to steel coils.

1421
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:17,110
Your Eyes Dart over the ground for
telltale signs of human tampering,

1422
01:33:17,111 --> 01:33:21,550
smooth dirt and unnaturally placed
vine attached to a pull pin.

1423
01:33:21,551 --> 01:33:22,384
Safety.

1424
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:27,310
A thin wire across your path of
broken brush time stands still.

1425
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:30,340
You're afraid to move at the same time.

1426
01:33:30,341 --> 01:33:32,590
You want to duck your
head and dash to safety.

1427
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:36,040
Maybe you can make it before
the detonation catches you,

1428
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:40,930
but one of the others you have
to get them all out. Keep cool.

1429
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:46,060
That's it. Bring the others slowly
into a straight file. Careful.

1430
01:33:46,510 --> 01:33:49,960
Watch where you step now.
Work your way up to the front.

1431
01:33:50,170 --> 01:33:55,170
Look carefully before each footfall
watch for nearly invisible wires.

1432
01:33:55,390 --> 01:33:59,950
One slight tug could bring metal tearing
through your flesh like a frenzied

1433
01:33:59,951 --> 01:34:04,810
power saw. Okay, let's move. Stay in line.

1434
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:09,310
Don't bench up. Can't let one
booby trap get more than one of us,

1435
01:34:09,370 --> 01:34:14,320
but which one? Me, him. Concentrate.
Don't think about the explosion.

1436
01:34:14,321 --> 01:34:18,910
Look, look, you can see them if you look
carefully enough, take another step.

1437
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:24,700
We're almost out of it. Christ don't
ambush us. Now we can't move, concentrate.

1438
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:27,280
Think of where you would plant them.

1439
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:32,460
Look for the telltale signs and
so it went tremendous pressure,

1440
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:38,980
followed by tremendous relief as
the booby trap area was cleared,

1441
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:44,230
then the journey continued only to bring
the patrol to another threatening area.

1442
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:47,110
It played on your nerves.

1443
01:34:48,430 --> 01:34:51,850
Somehow the men put on a show of bravado.

1444
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:58,360
I thought that section.
Talking about forget an IED.

1445
01:34:58,790 --> 01:35:01,520
I mean that's like what it's like.
They was just a perfect,

1446
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,030
perfect writing and
being on out on patrols.

1447
01:35:05,031 --> 01:35:07,880
Were you thinking there's going to be ids?
That's what your mind is thinking.

1448
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:10,750
That's what you're thinking. You're
looking at every little thing in the road.

1449
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:13,490
Every little piece of trash,
every little wire,

1450
01:35:13,491 --> 01:35:15,860
everything could be a pressure plate.
It could be a crush wire,

1451
01:35:15,861 --> 01:35:18,440
it could be an IED,
could just be anything.

1452
01:35:19,070 --> 01:35:22,880
And so you're just constantly in that
mode of assessing and looking and trying

1453
01:35:22,881 --> 01:35:27,650
to figure it out. And I thought that
that wasn't just a incredible job,

1454
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:31,550
especially by a guy that
actually triggered an id on
himself and got blown up.

1455
01:35:31,610 --> 01:35:35,390
And so he's probably feeling
that that pressure 10 fold,

1456
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:43,070
a leader who arbitrates when the laws
of land warfare overtaken by pragmatic

1457
01:35:43,071 --> 01:35:45,470
concern is treading on dangerous ground.

1458
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:50,720
The laws exist for practical and
humane reasons and I knew that well,

1459
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:55,940
but the consequences of my decisions
were immediate and I could not afford the

1460
01:35:55,941 --> 01:35:58,880
comfort of a philosophical
debate on issues.

1461
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:03,470
I tried to behave in a humane
manner and did not intimidate,

1462
01:36:04,070 --> 01:36:08,480
but I persisted until I was reasonably
assured that I had the truth or that my

1463
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:13,540
interviewee truly did not
know I owed my men that much.

1464
01:36:15,830 --> 01:36:20,480
One day a stay behind ambush element
got into a sudden firefight in the

1465
01:36:20,481 --> 01:36:23,720
exchange. One American had been hit
in the leg and was bleeding profusely.

1466
01:36:24,470 --> 01:36:28,220
As I approached the action with the rest
of the patrol intending to flank the

1467
01:36:28,221 --> 01:36:29,054
enemy,

1468
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:33,170
I noticed that the base of the hill we
were about to send was heavily mined.

1469
01:36:33,770 --> 01:36:38,590
A frightened farmer crouched in the grass
nearby. Come here, Papasan. I called non.

1470
01:36:39,050 --> 01:36:43,040
Ask them how to get through this stuff.
The farmers shook his head and dismay.

1471
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:46,730
I'll call came on the radio. Dammit. If
we don't get Archibald out of here fast,

1472
01:36:46,731 --> 01:36:51,710
he's going to bleed to death.
Ask them again. Nam Nan,

1473
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:54,200
I ordered again.

1474
01:36:54,230 --> 01:36:57,320
The farmer refused his
eyes widening and fear.

1475
01:36:57,950 --> 01:37:02,000
I took out my knife. Nan, tell
him I'll kill him right now.

1476
01:37:02,001 --> 01:37:05,720
If he doesn't tell us.
I had crossed the line.

1477
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:07,520
I wouldn't have killed him,

1478
01:37:07,730 --> 01:37:11,840
but he didn't know that and
the threat itself was criminal,

1479
01:37:12,770 --> 01:37:16,610
but I weighed that against the bleeding
soldier and the others who might bleed

1480
01:37:16,611 --> 01:37:18,440
if we didn't get through to them quickly.

1481
01:37:19,820 --> 01:37:24,230
A leader has no one to look to
for advice on such decisions.

1482
01:37:24,290 --> 01:37:26,450
He must do what he thinks is best,

1483
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:30,260
but he must not fool himself as
to the consequences of his chores.

1484
01:37:31,270 --> 01:37:35,870
War is not a series of case studies that
can be scrutinized with the objectivity.

1485
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:41,570
It is a series of stark confrontations
that must be faced under the most emotion

1486
01:37:41,571 --> 01:37:42,950
wrenching conditions.

1487
01:37:43,970 --> 01:37:48,020
War is the suffering and death of people,
you know,

1488
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:52,640
set against a background of the
suffering and death of people you do not.

1489
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:59,290
That reality tends to prejudice the
already tough choices between morality and

1490
01:37:59,311 --> 01:38:03,500
pragmatism.
The farmer led us through.

1491
01:38:04,910 --> 01:38:09,080
We forced the enemy away and extracted
our soldier in time to save his life.

1492
01:38:10,010 --> 01:38:13,160
We let the farmer go,
but not before I thanked him.

1493
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:14,700
Yeah,

1494
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:17,430
he looked at me as if I were crazy,

1495
01:38:22,060 --> 01:38:24,600
very enough to just say again,

1496
01:38:24,601 --> 01:38:29,100
this is another great description
of what you're dealing with in war

1497
01:38:30,690 --> 01:38:34,320
and the decisions that you have to
make in these horrible situations.

1498
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:39,900
Back to the book,
Fricker was nervous for the past few days.

1499
01:38:39,901 --> 01:38:44,580
He felt his number was coming up. I don't
know what's wrong with me, lieutenant.

1500
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:49,650
He had told me, shyly, I don't feel right.
What do you mean? Are you feeling sick?

1501
01:38:49,710 --> 01:38:53,790
I asked. No, it's not
that I just feel down

1502
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:57,030
like something bad is going to happen.

1503
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:00,390
Maybe you've been on point too often.

1504
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:04,620
I'll tell staff sergeant Robinson to
take you off. No, no, don't do that.

1505
01:39:05,670 --> 01:39:07,770
I'm the best man for that.
My squad.

1506
01:39:08,070 --> 01:39:09,960
I don't want any of the
guys thinking I'm yellow.

1507
01:39:11,690 --> 01:39:12,300
Okay.

1508
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:14,730
Fricker wasn't yellow.
He was scared,

1509
01:39:15,810 --> 01:39:20,010
but he was more scared of letting his
friends down than of getting hurt.

1510
01:39:21,420 --> 01:39:25,140
I urged him to take a break,
but he had insisted on staying on point.

1511
01:39:26,550 --> 01:39:28,440
I told Robinson to take them off.
Anyway.

1512
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:31,560
Fricker heard of it and pleaded
with me to put them back.

1513
01:39:32,490 --> 01:39:36,120
I yielded so on a lovely evening,

1514
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:40,590
Fricker was cautiously leading the squat
up a hill and the machine guns stitched

1515
01:39:40,591 --> 01:39:41,820
him across the chest.

1516
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:45,910
Robinson turned and dash down the slope,

1517
01:39:45,911 --> 01:39:48,910
making it 20 meters before he
stumbled and broke his ankle.

1518
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:53,950
10 meters behind Frickin nail
and a Wilson dove for cover.

1519
01:39:55,780 --> 01:40:00,220
Fricker went down on one knee and
spun around a phrase. His friends,

1520
01:40:02,190 --> 01:40:05,820
blood and air bubbled from
the holes in his chest.

1521
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:10,860
He dropped his weapon and tried to rise
his arms out stretched as if reaching

1522
01:40:10,861 --> 01:40:11,694
for help.

1523
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:17,780
His eyes opened wide and terrorist mouth
agape is blood spilled over as loose

1524
01:40:17,791 --> 01:40:22,610
lower lip as the machine gun
bullets tore into his back.

1525
01:40:22,820 --> 01:40:24,200
He tumbled face down,

1526
01:40:24,201 --> 01:40:28,310
arms still reaching out for
help that would come too late.

1527
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:35,010
Wilson took in the scene with Har
freakers dead. My God flickers dead.

1528
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:39,090
His voice rose above the clatter,
afraid that no one understood.

1529
01:40:39,091 --> 01:40:42,570
Wilson repeated his announcement.
Oh no, he's dead. He's dead.

1530
01:40:42,571 --> 01:40:47,340
He yelled with all his might
nail silenced him with a curt,

1531
01:40:47,341 --> 01:40:51,090
shut up, he's dead, and
that's all there is to it.

1532
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:56,710
Somehow nails words cut through the
hideousness of the moment more graphically

1533
01:40:56,711 --> 01:41:00,970
than freakers death.
Wilson was stunned into silence.

1534
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:03,310
There was a cursory exchange of rounds.

1535
01:41:03,311 --> 01:41:08,170
The enemy fled down the reverse slope
and freakers corpse became the and the

1536
01:41:08,171 --> 01:41:13,170
lame Robinson were evacuated.
Nail became the squad leader.

1537
01:41:15,190 --> 01:41:16,720
That was all there was to it.

1538
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:23,520
Another American had fallen one of
more than 58,000 to die in Vietnam.

1539
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:32,910
The action took a few minutes.
There was nothing unique about it.

1540
01:41:32,911 --> 01:41:34,470
A messy business to be sure,

1541
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:37,800
but one that can be cleaned up by
shipping off the body and making a few

1542
01:41:37,801 --> 01:41:39,180
personnel changes.

1543
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:44,860
But Fricker was dead
a few moments earlier.

1544
01:41:45,170 --> 01:41:48,910
He had been a young man with a
lifetime of experiences ahead of him.

1545
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:54,980
Now he was just a memory to his family
and to us a few moments earlier.

1546
01:41:54,981 --> 01:41:58,220
He was afraid some of his friends
would think of him as a coward.

1547
01:41:59,870 --> 01:42:03,710
Soon almost no one would
think of him at all.

1548
01:42:05,350 --> 01:42:08,530
His mother would get a telegram
and then a purple heart.

1549
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:13,960
Maybe I could write him up for a metal,
but what should I say?

1550
01:42:15,430 --> 01:42:20,430
That he was brave because
he was afraid to be afraid

1551
01:42:22,940 --> 01:42:26,450
that he saved his squad by walking
up to the machine gun first.

1552
01:42:28,070 --> 01:42:33,070
And what did he save them for so that
they might live a few more weeks before

1553
01:42:33,441 --> 01:42:35,180
following in his footsteps.

1554
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:41,420
He was all too much to consider
as nail.

1555
01:42:41,421 --> 01:42:43,920
It said he was dead

1556
01:42:45,930 --> 01:42:47,280
and that's all there was to it.

1557
01:42:50,940 --> 01:42:55,230
And here he talks a little bit about
the morality of war.

1558
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:59,970
It was not a simple matter of kill or
be killed. I had to think of my men.

1559
01:43:01,140 --> 01:43:06,140
I could not let them be killed because
of a rigid morality on my part.

1560
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:12,390
But if I compromised with that morality
too often I would become little more

1561
01:43:12,391 --> 01:43:15,720
than a war criminal unfit
to lead those men's.

1562
01:43:16,950 --> 01:43:19,860
I had to struggle to
keep a sense of balance

1563
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:23,281
that's there.

1564
01:43:23,281 --> 01:43:27,000
That's the crazy thing about the
dichotomy of leadership is that these,

1565
01:43:27,030 --> 01:43:30,510
these opposing forces that are pulling
you in two different directions,

1566
01:43:30,630 --> 01:43:34,650
they're both, they're both correct.
It's correct of both. Correct.

1567
01:43:34,651 --> 01:43:38,010
And the balance is where you need to stay.
I shouldn't say that.

1568
01:43:38,011 --> 01:43:42,450
They're both correct, but they're both
file bull options. You can rationalize it.

1569
01:43:42,451 --> 01:43:46,110
Either one of them, you can rationalize,
hey we shouldn't do anything at all.

1570
01:43:46,110 --> 01:43:49,050
Let's just stay inside the wire.
Let me protect my guys aid.

1571
01:43:49,051 --> 01:43:50,910
You could rationalize that
and you can rationalize,

1572
01:43:50,911 --> 01:43:53,780
hey go out and kill everybody
before they kill us.

1573
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:56,840
And what you have to do as a
leader in a combat situation,

1574
01:43:56,841 --> 01:44:00,500
you have to balance those dichotomies and
you know you could translate that into

1575
01:44:00,530 --> 01:44:03,560
businesses. Cause you in a business,
you've got to take care of your people,

1576
01:44:03,561 --> 01:44:05,540
but you've got to make money,
you know,

1577
01:44:07,580 --> 01:44:08,780
so there's all these,

1578
01:44:08,930 --> 01:44:11,780
when you're in a leadership position
and there's opposing forces that are

1579
01:44:11,781 --> 01:44:15,530
pulling at you and you have to balance
them and you have to pay attention

1580
01:44:15,531 --> 01:44:19,100
because what happens is suddenly you start
going too far in one direction or the

1581
01:44:19,101 --> 01:44:20,030
other and you start to re,

1582
01:44:20,050 --> 01:44:23,420
you start to lose control where you
start to see things go sideways.

1583
01:44:23,421 --> 01:44:24,740
That's when you need to say to yourself,
wait a second,

1584
01:44:24,741 --> 01:44:28,250
am I going too far in one direction right
now? That's probably what is happening

1585
01:44:31,310 --> 01:44:33,530
now.
Here we go.

1586
01:44:33,531 --> 01:44:36,350
This is just a quick
little interlude they had,

1587
01:44:36,590 --> 01:44:41,590
they had acquired a 60 millimeter mortar
and they were training with it and one

1588
01:44:42,651 --> 01:44:46,670
of the guys was wanting to train it. They
didn't really let him use it too much,

1589
01:44:46,671 --> 01:44:50,240
even though he was excited to try it
out and they ended up getting attacked.

1590
01:44:50,241 --> 01:44:54,530
And the only guy that's into the vicinity
of the mortar to use it is this guy

1591
01:44:54,590 --> 01:44:55,423
Spangler.

1592
01:44:56,240 --> 01:45:01,130
And so he attempts to fire the mortar
and he screws it up a bunch of times and

1593
01:45:01,220 --> 01:45:03,290
the VC end up getting away

1594
01:45:05,810 --> 01:45:06,950
and Mcdonald's says,

1595
01:45:06,980 --> 01:45:11,980
dejectedly I scout I scowled at Spangler
who felt absolutely terrible about the

1596
01:45:13,521 --> 01:45:18,410
whole affair. I knew it
wasn't his fault, it was mine.

1597
01:45:19,130 --> 01:45:24,130
I had failed the train him even though
he was eager to learn more ownership

1598
01:45:24,441 --> 01:45:29,390
right there from mcdonough.
Now

1599
01:45:31,370 --> 01:45:32,203
this is,

1600
01:45:32,210 --> 01:45:37,070
this is just a shocker in the book and
it's one of those situations where he's

1601
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:40,570
going really, this, how
does this even happen? Um,

1602
01:45:40,700 --> 01:45:43,970
Mcdonogh decides that they're,
they're actually by the ocean.

1603
01:45:44,690 --> 01:45:49,690
There are a couple of miles from the
ocean and they all have their skin.

1604
01:45:49,701 --> 01:45:52,190
They have jungle rot, their skin,
they get a little infections,

1605
01:45:52,191 --> 01:45:55,790
they got bug bites and they're
just all jacked up from this,

1606
01:45:56,060 --> 01:45:59,570
from just from just living
in this environment. And he
knows, he says, you know,

1607
01:45:59,571 --> 01:46:01,970
if we get these guys to
patrol down to the ocean,

1608
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,490
they can take a swim in the ocean. They
get out in the sun dry. Some of their,

1609
01:46:05,130 --> 01:46:09,980
you know, wounds off or what
have you. So they go down there,

1610
01:46:09,981 --> 01:46:10,970
he puts together the plan.

1611
01:46:10,971 --> 01:46:15,800
He actually has to like ask the guys
to go, cause there's, they're saying,

1612
01:46:15,801 --> 01:46:19,160
you know what, I'd rather sit
here and just have bad skin.

1613
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:24,280
Then go out and have to do another
patrol just to go swimming.

1614
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:27,170
And he kind of convinced
as a couple of guys, hey,

1615
01:46:27,171 --> 01:46:29,120
there's a couple guys that want to go.
There's a couple of guys that say,

1616
01:46:29,660 --> 01:46:32,870
you know, I'd rather not go.
He convinces the guys to go.

1617
01:46:34,130 --> 01:46:38,150
He puts together a plan. He wants to
send some strong swimmers with the group.

1618
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:41,180
He's actually pretty aware
of the danger of the ocean.

1619
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,130
He sends the guys down there,

1620
01:46:43,190 --> 01:46:48,190
they get down there and to
the guy's drown and die.

1621
01:46:54,610 --> 01:46:56,680
And again,
we're going to hear some ownership here.

1622
01:46:56,681 --> 01:47:00,610
James was the guy that was running
the patrol and mcdonough says,

1623
01:47:00,611 --> 01:47:05,200
I could not criticize James.
He had not followed my instructions,

1624
01:47:05,201 --> 01:47:07,600
but the fault was mine,
not his.

1625
01:47:08,260 --> 01:47:12,190
I had built the idea into a plan
and then ordered its execution.

1626
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:17,410
In so doing,
I had executed Spangler and Evans.

1627
01:47:18,700 --> 01:47:20,380
I felt a hundred years old,

1628
01:47:21,310 --> 01:47:25,150
no tragedy in that God forsaken
country had to hit me so hard.

1629
01:47:25,300 --> 01:47:26,500
It was my fault.

1630
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:31,210
I was the cause of two deaths
in the name of good intentions.

1631
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:33,400
I had talked those men into dying.

1632
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:37,000
I staggered under the thought.

1633
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:41,050
The cost of leadership had finally
been too high and I couldn't bear it.

1634
01:47:41,950 --> 01:47:43,930
I didn't consider myself fit to lead,

1635
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:49,800
but the job was mine and I
couldn't quit for better or worse,

1636
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:51,750
okay.

1637
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:56,670
I had to do it.
They get back to camp and

1638
01:47:58,300 --> 01:47:59,760
oh Wilson,

1639
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:03,210
who is good friends with the evidence
that one of the guys that had drown,

1640
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:07,380
he says Wilson was
crying for loss of Evans.

1641
01:48:07,381 --> 01:48:11,610
His close friend had deeply affected him,
ashamed of his tears.

1642
01:48:11,910 --> 01:48:16,110
He hunkered down behind his machine gun
at the strong point on the south side of

1643
01:48:16,111 --> 01:48:16,944
the perimeter.

1644
01:48:19,570 --> 01:48:24,570
I spoke of Evan's goodness and try to
draw from that a benevolent interpretation

1645
01:48:25,391 --> 01:48:28,540
of his death.
Evans was at peace.

1646
01:48:28,541 --> 01:48:32,200
Now I told Wilson he was no
longer part of his nightmares war,

1647
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:36,130
although I couldn't follow
the logic of my own words.

1648
01:48:36,340 --> 01:48:38,380
They seem to lighten the Wilson's load.

1649
01:48:39,610 --> 01:48:44,260
He began to talk together.
We groped for meaning and a man's death.

1650
01:48:45,430 --> 01:48:50,290
I did my best to conceal my own skepticism
and agreed with everything he said.

1651
01:48:51,610 --> 01:48:55,180
Somehow we came to the conclusion
that Evan's death was a good thing.

1652
01:48:56,230 --> 01:48:58,840
It must be good if God willed it.

1653
01:49:00,580 --> 01:49:03,010
By then I wasn't sure
who was consoling whom.

1654
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:05,920
Sometimes words aren't
important for their content,

1655
01:49:05,921 --> 01:49:10,921
but only for there being said and whatever
we said that night seemed to be good

1656
01:49:11,141 --> 01:49:12,430
enough for both of us.

1657
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:16,150
Although I couldn't excuse
myself for the drownings.

1658
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:21,280
I realized that I owed it not only to
Wilson but the whole platoon to put the

1659
01:49:21,281 --> 01:49:22,570
incident behind me.

1660
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:25,333
Okay.

1661
01:49:25,450 --> 01:49:29,980
Now the next situation that
they're in there doing an assault

1662
01:49:31,510 --> 01:49:34,840
and as they get through these, there's
assaulting all mine through a target area.

1663
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:37,330
Then as they sold them online
through this target area,

1664
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:41,470
there's a Viet Cong Penn.

1665
01:49:41,471 --> 01:49:44,920
His weapon had been smashed by around and
he wasn't able to fight and so he just

1666
01:49:44,921 --> 01:49:47,830
surrendered and this guy who I mentioned,

1667
01:49:47,831 --> 01:49:49,980
this Guy Nan before this Nan
is a Vietnamese guy. That's,

1668
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:53,740
that's like a translator interpreter.
They call them Kit Carson Scouts.

1669
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:57,880
They know that they know the area,
they speak the language and so he says,

1670
01:49:58,690 --> 01:50:01,720
ask him if he's got any
buddies on flank security.

1671
01:50:01,810 --> 01:50:06,810
I instructed Nan a rush of Vietnamese
words and sued only to be answered by know

1672
01:50:07,661 --> 01:50:12,190
Beck and American Vietnamese Slang
version of I don't understand.

1673
01:50:13,350 --> 01:50:16,090
God dammit. He speak in
Vietnamese to you. Answer him.

1674
01:50:16,180 --> 01:50:19,660
I shouted in the prisoner's face.
Nan asked him again,

1675
01:50:19,990 --> 01:50:22,420
demands face demand turned his face away.

1676
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:27,420
Defiantly my anger was rising after my
worries of the night before about finding

1677
01:50:28,751 --> 01:50:31,840
our way to the target and the
successful attack that followed.

1678
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:34,960
Everything could be
overturned by an arrogant,

1679
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:37,750
by the arrogance of one prisoner.

1680
01:50:38,780 --> 01:50:42,250
Killigan seeing the way
my face was flushed,

1681
01:50:42,460 --> 01:50:46,120
made the quiet comment.
Don't be mad lieutenant.

1682
01:50:46,570 --> 01:50:49,810
He's just a soldier.
Same as you and me.

1683
01:50:51,130 --> 01:50:52,870
Damn him.
He was right.

1684
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:59,620
I would hope to do the same if I were
in the shoes of a captive of the captive

1685
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:04,720
Killigan. The quiet man who disavowed
all pretense of leadership. Once again,

1686
01:51:04,721 --> 01:51:09,340
made me aware of the fragile
superiority of my own leadership.

1687
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:15,340
And then as they proceed on,

1688
01:51:16,510 --> 01:51:18,760
they take these captured guys

1689
01:51:20,290 --> 01:51:25,120
and they bring them back to the company
command post and we'll go back to the

1690
01:51:25,121 --> 01:51:28,630
book. At the end of the mornings fight,
we linked up with the rest of the company,

1691
01:51:28,690 --> 01:51:32,830
essentially a reinforced platoon that had
comp that comprise the blocking force.

1692
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:36,490
I turned over our prisoners to
the platoon leader, a youngster,

1693
01:51:36,491 --> 01:51:41,200
and his first action, who I later found
out did not last another two weeks.

1694
01:51:42,490 --> 01:51:46,060
Predictably the company commander
had stayed back at the base,

1695
01:51:47,740 --> 01:51:50,260
bring the goat,
bring the Guccis over to the CP.

1696
01:51:51,490 --> 01:51:56,350
Lieutenant pastored my sergeant,
sergeant, they aren't geeks.

1697
01:51:56,380 --> 01:52:00,460
I said quietly,
they're soldiers just like you and me.

1698
01:52:02,410 --> 01:52:05,380
For a moment I thought I
saw Killigan Xyz flash.

1699
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:07,810
Then we started our journey home.

1700
01:52:09,700 --> 01:52:11,860
They're going to go on up
company sized operation,

1701
01:52:12,070 --> 01:52:15,370
which means they're taking multiple
platoons of which Mcdonald's,

1702
01:52:15,371 --> 01:52:20,371
one of the platoon commanders and the
company commander was named Moray and

1703
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:25,310
Morei calls them all
together to do brief moray.

1704
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:28,000
And I haven't talked about this much,
but morays, kind of a guy that's,

1705
01:52:28,750 --> 01:52:31,330
he's not real proactive and
getting out in the field,

1706
01:52:31,990 --> 01:52:33,970
so he's sort of staying back on base.

1707
01:52:33,971 --> 01:52:38,971
He's a little nervous about the situation
and this is just a great example.

1708
01:52:40,450 --> 01:52:43,960
And then he's got the other
platoon commanders who you
kind of hear his judgment

1709
01:52:43,961 --> 01:52:47,780
on them, but this is a great
display of leadership of,

1710
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:52,790
of taking ownership up and down the
chain of command and to his peers.

1711
01:52:55,580 --> 01:53:00,020
So the, here we go from the book and the
plan would put Marae who's the company

1712
01:53:00,021 --> 01:53:00,441
commander,

1713
01:53:00,441 --> 01:53:04,490
2000 meters away from our present
location and 4,000 meters away from the

1714
01:53:04,491 --> 01:53:05,324
objective.

1715
01:53:06,590 --> 01:53:10,670
I tried to conceal my disdain cer request,

1716
01:53:10,671 --> 01:53:14,060
permission to control the operational
movement of the maneuver forces in the

1717
01:53:14,061 --> 01:53:15,740
initial phase of the operation.

1718
01:53:16,490 --> 01:53:20,900
I spoke with what I hope with as a totally
expressionless face. So he's saying,

1719
01:53:20,901 --> 01:53:22,370
listen boss,
so you're going to be way over there.

1720
01:53:22,490 --> 01:53:27,170
Why don't I just go ahead and
control this? The boss says,

1721
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:29,150
sure, Jim, I guess that makes sense.

1722
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:33,080
You're the senior lieutenant among the
platoons. Did you have a plan in mind?

1723
01:53:33,590 --> 01:53:37,640
Marae was easy and I was going
to take advantage of it. Boom.

1724
01:53:39,080 --> 01:53:40,910
I briefed him on my consent to come.

1725
01:53:40,911 --> 01:53:45,590
My concept routes of movement where we
would set up time of anticipated contact

1726
01:53:45,591 --> 01:53:47,160
with the enemy and types of weapon.

1727
01:53:47,160 --> 01:53:52,160
Tree wouldn't carry the captain concurred
with the plans then excused himself.

1728
01:53:52,730 --> 01:53:57,710
I've got to get back to the CP and report
to battalion seeing an opportunity for

1729
01:53:57,711 --> 01:54:01,040
complete freedom of
action. I continued, sir,

1730
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:03,920
I need to flesh out the details
with the other platoon leaders.

1731
01:54:03,980 --> 01:54:08,510
May I brief them in your absence?
Yes, certainly. Carry on.

1732
01:54:09,290 --> 01:54:12,650
He left as we stood up to salute.
So there you see what just happened,

1733
01:54:12,651 --> 01:54:15,410
how beautiful that was.
He took total control

1734
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:19,340
and not only did he take
control up the chain of command,

1735
01:54:19,341 --> 01:54:23,300
but he's going to get some control
over the peers as well and he's,

1736
01:54:23,420 --> 01:54:27,920
he's judging and passing judgment on
the way the other platoons are running

1737
01:54:27,930 --> 01:54:29,440
their,
well,

1738
01:54:29,540 --> 01:54:32,900
the way the other platoon commanders
are running their platoons and he says,

1739
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:34,010
observing all this,

1740
01:54:34,011 --> 01:54:38,720
I signed Lee Lee wrote Lieutenant
smally out of the plan.

1741
01:54:39,290 --> 01:54:42,410
If he could not exercise
minimum control in the defense,

1742
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:44,900
he would surely fall apart in the attack.

1743
01:54:45,530 --> 01:54:48,770
Lieutenant Evans First
Platoon's leader was anxious.

1744
01:54:48,810 --> 01:54:51,980
He had been on the job only a week
and this was his first operation.

1745
01:54:52,790 --> 01:54:56,660
He was a tall, good looking boy from the
Midwest, but I felt he was too eager.

1746
01:54:57,680 --> 01:55:01,790
He was disappointed to be standing
pat for the night as the reserve unit,

1747
01:55:02,750 --> 01:55:04,610
but the call had been raised,
not mine.

1748
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:09,740
Perhaps it was unfair of me to make snap
judgments of others and then plan my

1749
01:55:09,741 --> 01:55:13,490
axis on the basis of those judgments.
The fought bothered me,

1750
01:55:13,670 --> 01:55:15,170
but not enough to deter me.

1751
01:55:15,740 --> 01:55:19,460
I was in the business of evaluating
people and the traits of other men would

1752
01:55:19,461 --> 01:55:23,210
determine my own fate and that
of my soldiers presumptuous.

1753
01:55:23,211 --> 01:55:27,440
Though my role may have been, I had
to make judgments and act accordingly.

1754
01:55:28,070 --> 01:55:32,210
Marae was timid, smiley
was weak. Evans was eager.

1755
01:55:32,810 --> 01:55:37,190
I did not condemn them for that.
I noted it and adjusted.

1756
01:55:37,730 --> 01:55:40,820
We were in a war,
not a community social,

1757
01:55:43,660 --> 01:55:48,080
just great leadership example of how you
lead up and down the chain of command.

1758
01:55:50,420 --> 01:55:53,090
So now they're actually
about to head out on this,

1759
01:55:53,150 --> 01:55:58,150
on this operation about 50 meters shore
to the forward of the Stream Killigan

1760
01:55:58,821 --> 01:56:02,120
dog leg to the west and
brought us up on the trail.

1761
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:06,380
The heavy labor and the Bush brought
beads of sweat to my forehead and I

1762
01:56:06,381 --> 01:56:08,060
concentrated in our present movement,

1763
01:56:08,061 --> 01:56:10,280
leaving thoughts of the
night operation for later,

1764
01:56:10,790 --> 01:56:14,090
we were assuming in the treacherous
position of doubling back on a previously

1765
01:56:14,091 --> 01:56:17,960
used root.
Always dangerous tactic for a second.

1766
01:56:17,961 --> 01:56:20,390
I considered yelling at
Killigan to get off the trail,

1767
01:56:20,570 --> 01:56:24,530
but we were so close to the Ford that by
the time we maneuvered off the trail we

1768
01:56:24,531 --> 01:56:29,060
would have been at the crossing site
as Killigan moved ahead and is stealthy

1769
01:56:29,061 --> 01:56:29,810
glide.

1770
01:56:29,810 --> 01:56:34,400
I saw him freeze momentarily and then
glanced to his left directly into a Bush

1771
01:56:34,401 --> 01:56:35,540
overlooking the trail.

1772
01:56:36,530 --> 01:56:40,010
I knew in an instant that we were
in eminent danger for Killigan.

1773
01:56:40,011 --> 01:56:44,570
Never made abrupt moves except at the
movement of conflict except at the moment

1774
01:56:44,571 --> 01:56:47,240
of conflict.
Killigan turned back to us,

1775
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:49,730
his face contorting as
if to shout a warning.

1776
01:56:50,210 --> 01:56:52,580
I yelled ambush and dove to my left.

1777
01:56:53,090 --> 01:56:57,230
Killigan took a grenade blast and
the face at point blank range.

1778
01:56:58,040 --> 01:57:02,300
At the same time, Sergeant James went
down with this bullet in his shoulder.

1779
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:07,370
The enemy was spraying us from a position
across the rice patty kill again and I

1780
01:57:07,371 --> 01:57:11,060
had hit a comp. Killigan had hit
a command detonated booby trap.

1781
01:57:12,380 --> 01:57:13,200
Okay.

1782
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:17,160
I pressed my face into the dirt as
bullets wind over my outstretched body.

1783
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:21,870
I calculated the best. At best.
There were only four of us were left.

1784
01:57:22,620 --> 01:57:26,490
I peeked out from under my helmet to see
James Struggling to get off the trail.

1785
01:57:26,700 --> 01:57:29,580
The red blotch widening in
his dark green fatigues.

1786
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:31,920
He was moving not into the bushes,

1787
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:36,390
but toward Killigan who is lying face
down in the patty with a plastic knocked

1788
01:57:36,391 --> 01:57:41,391
him his blood turning the yellowish
water read within minutes.

1789
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:44,430
If he were still alive,
Killigan would drown.

1790
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:49,700
Okay,

1791
01:57:49,700 --> 01:57:54,290
so they get killed or get out of that
situation. They get back to their base.

1792
01:57:54,620 --> 01:57:57,500
They go back again to do the ambush.

1793
01:57:58,670 --> 01:58:03,110
Their hit again on the ambush.
They evacuated guy,

1794
01:58:05,060 --> 01:58:10,060
they move again and now they're there
in the final moment where they are going

1795
01:58:13,750 --> 01:58:16,160
to do this big ambush
as part of the company.

1796
01:58:16,161 --> 01:58:19,250
So this is kind of what this last
section of the book is leading to.

1797
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:25,960
It is morning until they're actually
doing their final movement into the ambush

1798
01:58:27,111 --> 01:58:30,290
position.
It is morning and there was a grime,

1799
01:58:30,350 --> 01:58:35,240
a grimness in the drizzling air.
Silent figures move to the West,

1800
01:58:35,300 --> 01:58:39,890
shoulders bent under equipment,
loads, buckles taped for silence,

1801
01:58:40,010 --> 01:58:42,850
camouflage paint on taught faces.

1802
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:45,910
Google's in the night.

1803
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:50,530
Young boys really from
places like Valdosta,

1804
01:58:50,650 --> 01:58:53,710
San Diego, boulder, Madison,

1805
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:58,420
Portland out to kill Asian
boys who are out to kill them.

1806
01:59:00,010 --> 01:59:02,290
The gears of war grind together.

1807
01:59:02,291 --> 01:59:07,291
Unrelentingly mechanisms in motion that
will catch up human flesh as they mesh.

1808
01:59:09,160 --> 01:59:12,430
Society's clash,
politicians deal,

1809
01:59:12,940 --> 01:59:14,230
diplomats debate.

1810
01:59:14,950 --> 01:59:19,810
Young men struggle to the
death tomorrow or the next day.

1811
01:59:20,020 --> 01:59:23,110
Mothers will receive the news and cry,

1812
01:59:24,250 --> 01:59:26,950
but nothing will stop the mornings.
Killings,

1813
01:59:31,480 --> 01:59:31,920
okay,

1814
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:34,230
they finally get to
their ambush site and now

1815
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:39,360
the ambush is about to
happen simultaneously.

1816
01:59:39,361 --> 01:59:42,150
Another group of enemy walks
into the third ambush site.

1817
01:59:42,660 --> 01:59:46,230
It is tripped and all the enemy or
killed the first group of three.

1818
01:59:46,231 --> 01:59:50,580
Here's the melee and panics.
One Darts Back Nan,

1819
01:59:50,581 --> 01:59:53,790
the old scout catches him
with a round in the side.

1820
01:59:54,120 --> 01:59:59,010
He falls in and the old man finishes
him with two rounds in the head.

1821
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:03,780
Two of the enemy scrambled through
sergeant don'ts positioned and our hit.

1822
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:08,340
One falls dead.
The other scramp scampers into the brush.

1823
02:00:09,150 --> 02:00:13,230
Dawn pursues
the wounded enemy.

1824
02:00:13,231 --> 02:00:15,120
Ducks into a hole in the ground,

1825
02:00:15,390 --> 02:00:18,690
obviously is familiar with
the territory in Vietnamese.

1826
02:00:18,870 --> 02:00:23,850
Don't yells for him to come out.
There is no reply done. Yells again,

1827
02:00:24,450 --> 02:00:29,280
bullets spray out of the hole.
Done lobs a grenade. Dirt,

1828
02:00:29,340 --> 02:00:33,360
leaves and flesh fly out of the
opening in front of a blast.

1829
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:37,830
Done throws a second grenade,
a death rattle.

1830
02:00:37,831 --> 02:00:42,831
Rasps from the whole Sergeant Dunn looks
around for the newest soldier spotting

1831
02:00:44,191 --> 02:00:45,150
an 18 year old.

1832
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:50,360
He sends him in a safe way to harden
the youngster toward the events in store

1833
02:00:50,581 --> 02:00:52,140
for him during the year to come.

1834
02:00:53,340 --> 02:00:56,850
The youth emerges dragging
the Vietcong behind him.

1835
02:00:57,870 --> 02:01:02,400
It's a gruesome sight.
The man's face, nose,

1836
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:06,240
mouth,
eyes are gone.

1837
02:01:07,770 --> 02:01:11,940
Air is sucked in and out of the hole
where the nostrils used to connect the

1838
02:01:11,941 --> 02:01:15,150
jelly,
like mass rising and falling in bubbles,

1839
02:01:16,590 --> 02:01:21,480
wounds, gape everywhere on his body.
There is nothing we can do for him.

1840
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:26,220
It would be inhumane to prolong his agony.

1841
02:01:27,720 --> 02:01:32,100
So they accomplish that ambush and
they're continuing to press the enemy.

1842
02:01:34,290 --> 02:01:39,120
But something that Mcdonogh didn't count,

1843
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:45,130
something that he couldn't have predicted
or that he failed to predict back to

1844
02:01:46,371 --> 02:01:46,880
the book.

1845
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:51,880
But I underestimated the ruthlessness
of our enemy and I failed to realize the

1846
02:01:52,881 --> 02:01:57,860
extent to which political ideology
can displace human morality.

1847
02:01:58,850 --> 02:02:03,850
It was a major oversight and it costs us
the village of Trong Lam and Trong Lam

1848
02:02:05,541 --> 02:02:08,840
is the village that they were actually
their perimeters next to this whole time.

1849
02:02:09,200 --> 02:02:11,240
And I should have gone over
that right in the beginning,

1850
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:15,050
but Trong Lam is the village
that they were there to protect.

1851
02:02:15,051 --> 02:02:20,000
They're there to protect these villagers
and keep them safe and keep the Viet

1852
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,890
Cong and the communist out of the area.

1853
02:02:23,780 --> 02:02:28,310
So they're sitting in their, in
their perimeter one night, you know,

1854
02:02:28,370 --> 02:02:32,510
they're literally just
meters from the village.

1855
02:02:33,450 --> 02:02:37,850
And that's where this whole story is
taking place and as they're sitting there,

1856
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:39,140
and we'll go to the book,

1857
02:02:39,141 --> 02:02:43,100
the first explosion ripped one of the
hots apart in a blaze of brilliant orange

1858
02:02:43,101 --> 02:02:47,360
and yellow flame. Another
definitely explosion than
another rip through the air,

1859
02:02:48,110 --> 02:02:51,590
punctuated by the Staccato
clatter of automatic weapons.

1860
02:02:52,100 --> 02:02:55,820
We braced trying to print,
pinpoint the direction of the attack.

1861
02:02:57,590 --> 02:03:01,700
My God, I explained, I exclaimed
to no one in particular,

1862
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:07,610
they're hitting the village.
It would be a butchery.

1863
02:03:08,660 --> 02:03:13,660
The Viet Cong had pennys
traded the eastern end of
the village and we're moving

1864
02:03:14,151 --> 02:03:15,950
from thatch hut to thatch hut,

1865
02:03:15,951 --> 02:03:20,330
throwing Satchel charges inside and
shooting down anything that moved.

1866
02:03:21,650 --> 02:03:26,300
Sergeant Palamon
leave back third squad and come with me.

1867
02:03:26,301 --> 02:03:28,730
We're counter attacking into
the village and two minutes

1868
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:33,770
they dashed for the village.
We dashed for the village.

1869
02:03:33,771 --> 02:03:38,540
As the flames burst upward,
the scene revealed before us was ghastly.

1870
02:03:39,260 --> 02:03:41,930
A mother ran by me with
her decapitated baby,

1871
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:47,140
her own left arm hanging by a strip
of flesh to Viet cong stood behind her

1872
02:03:47,391 --> 02:03:51,560
trying to shoot them down in cold rage.
I fired into their faces,

1873
02:03:51,620 --> 02:03:54,560
their heads collapsing into pulpy mush.

1874
02:03:56,600 --> 02:04:00,530
Two young girls came running at me.
Tears of pain streaming from their eyes.

1875
02:04:00,740 --> 02:04:04,160
At a glance, I could see that both
had been disfigured by shrapnel.

1876
02:04:05,060 --> 02:04:09,500
The Vietcong had their mission kill as
many villagers as quickly as possible and

1877
02:04:09,501 --> 02:04:10,760
they were doing it well,

1878
02:04:10,970 --> 02:04:14,720
but they didn't expect our sudden
rush upon them at point blank range

1879
02:04:16,940 --> 02:04:20,630
from somewhere in the smoke and fire.
A woman emerge with her young song.

1880
02:04:21,680 --> 02:04:24,920
She thrust the little boy at me
begging for help in Vietnamese.

1881
02:04:25,070 --> 02:04:27,710
The boy was folded completely
in half at the stomach,

1882
02:04:27,711 --> 02:04:31,640
a deep wound across the small of his
back allowing his fat little body to be

1883
02:04:31,641 --> 02:04:36,440
creased as neatly as a piece of cardboard.
Surely he was dead.

1884
02:04:38,190 --> 02:04:42,600
I looked into the mother's eyes and
patted her on the head. Later, I said,

1885
02:04:42,660 --> 02:04:46,620
I'll help you later. We press the
attack back to the edge of the village.

1886
02:04:46,740 --> 02:04:48,750
Almost a fourth of it was now burning.

1887
02:04:49,320 --> 02:04:52,650
One more American fell with a
chest wound and collapsed his lung.

1888
02:04:54,330 --> 02:04:56,010
We broke the back of the attack.

1889
02:04:56,310 --> 02:05:00,510
Vc bodies late sprawled on the wire
through which they could not withdraw

1890
02:05:02,250 --> 02:05:04,620
the dead and dying. Lee Everywhere. A bid.

1891
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:09,480
Amid the burning huts from the
glare of the roaring flames,

1892
02:05:09,481 --> 02:05:14,481
I could see dead and wounded Vietnamese
laying in twisted piles already.

1893
02:05:15,121 --> 02:05:19,410
The older women had begun their pitiful
whales of morning shrieking and tearing

1894
02:05:19,411 --> 02:05:23,310
at their hair and faces.
Smoke filled the air,

1895
02:05:23,490 --> 02:05:27,660
but it could not cover the acrid smell
of death that filled my nostrils.

1896
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:32,460
Children's search for their missing elders
are huddled in groups groping at each

1897
02:05:32,461 --> 02:05:35,970
other for comfort there.
Eyes wide and terror.

1898
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:42,200
A mother rock to one legged baby to her
breast is lifeless eyes undisturbed by

1899
02:05:42,211 --> 02:05:44,580
the bright flame sill writing them both

1900
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:48,390
the worst had happened.

1901
02:05:49,620 --> 02:05:54,210
The enemy had struck directly against
the village and it most assuredly killed

1902
02:05:54,211 --> 02:05:56,760
and wounded many of their own families.

1903
02:05:58,020 --> 02:06:00,780
It was unbelievable,
but it had been done.

1904
02:06:02,850 --> 02:06:07,850
I knew that Trong Lam had been a defeat
like the entire American system in

1905
02:06:09,541 --> 02:06:14,010
Vietnam. We had fought a limited
military war with constrained objectives.

1906
02:06:14,670 --> 02:06:19,650
The enemy had fought a total political
war with no preordained restrictions.

1907
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:22,020
We were doomed from the outset.

1908
02:06:26,610 --> 02:06:31,610
We were the focus of the Vietcong attacks
because we kept the village alive if

1909
02:06:32,221 --> 02:06:35,670
we died so with the village,
but even at that,

1910
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:38,340
we were the indirect objective,

1911
02:06:39,120 --> 02:06:43,440
the village with the direct objective.
If the villages were destroyed,

1912
02:06:44,010 --> 02:06:45,540
then there would be no village,

1913
02:06:47,340 --> 02:06:50,580
but only now did I understand
that kind of logic.

1914
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:54,780
It had not occurred to me that the
enemy could take such a step to hit.

1915
02:06:54,781 --> 02:06:59,781
The village would ensure the wounding
and killing of their own kin in a battle

1916
02:07:01,081 --> 02:07:03,090
within the confines of the village itself.

1917
02:07:03,091 --> 02:07:05,760
There could be no
discrimination among family,

1918
02:07:05,940 --> 02:07:09,060
communist sympathizers
and government loyalists.

1919
02:07:10,850 --> 02:07:15,690
Every day I saw the children
of the village. They were
like all children. Cute,

1920
02:07:15,780 --> 02:07:20,220
endearing, growing with the emotional
and physical needs of children,

1921
02:07:20,221 --> 02:07:24,720
the world over. I couldn't
hurt them. It was unthinkable.

1922
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:30,030
The possibility was so barbaric
that it was alien to my mind,

1923
02:07:31,290 --> 02:07:36,290
but my mind was not the mind of the enemy
do I tried to understand them even to

1924
02:07:37,541 --> 02:07:40,060
think like them if only to defeat them.

1925
02:07:41,620 --> 02:07:45,490
I had fallen short for a few more days.

1926
02:07:47,380 --> 02:07:49,870
We continued to patrol the area.

1927
02:07:51,130 --> 02:07:53,050
It was a bureaucratic gesture,

1928
02:07:53,270 --> 02:07:56,860
a mere continuance of what we
had been doing for so long.

1929
02:07:57,910 --> 02:08:02,290
I kept to myself my own recognition
of the emptiness of our work.

1930
02:08:03,850 --> 02:08:07,540
It was essential for the
men to be convinced of the
importance of their mission.

1931
02:08:09,710 --> 02:08:12,170
Chuang lamb was no more,

1932
02:08:13,940 --> 02:08:17,900
but leadership must always be positive.

1933
02:08:25,750 --> 02:08:27,730
So he wasn't really expecting that,

1934
02:08:28,240 --> 02:08:31,810
that the VC would come in
and just slaughter everyone
in the village or as many

1935
02:08:31,811 --> 02:08:32,770
people as they good,

1936
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:37,390
unbelievable savagery.

1937
02:08:37,950 --> 02:08:38,783
Mm.

1938
02:08:40,640 --> 02:08:43,070
Now, as we wrap this up, he's,

1939
02:08:45,320 --> 02:08:47,220
he's [inaudible]

1940
02:08:47,460 --> 02:08:50,580
gets his relief just like he covered
in the beginning of the book and it's,

1941
02:08:50,760 --> 02:08:55,140
he takes over for somebody. Somebody
comes to take his place and he leaves

1942
02:08:59,560 --> 02:09:04,560
and he tries to keep track of what
happened to them or how they fought and

1943
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:09,230
things that occurred. And we'll
go to the book here as scheduled.

1944
02:09:09,231 --> 02:09:12,710
The platoon moved on and continued
to fight as long as I could.

1945
02:09:12,711 --> 02:09:17,210
I kept the watch on the fate of the
men specialists nail was wounded,

1946
02:09:17,211 --> 02:09:18,044
yet again,

1947
02:09:19,160 --> 02:09:23,330
platoon sergeant Palamon got out in front
of the platoon in a firefight and took

1948
02:09:23,331 --> 02:09:26,360
an enemy rocket propelled
grenade in the right leg.

1949
02:09:27,800 --> 02:09:30,500
I learned that corporate
Killigan survived his wounds,

1950
02:09:30,650 --> 02:09:33,440
although we lost a long and
a stretch of intestines.

1951
02:09:34,790 --> 02:09:39,790
Sergeant Don made it home on touch
to one of the few Sergeant James and

1952
02:09:39,861 --> 02:09:41,450
specialists king were killed.

1953
02:09:41,750 --> 02:09:45,230
Although the circumstances surrounding
their deaths were never made clear to me.

1954
02:09:46,610 --> 02:09:47,420
Okay.

1955
02:09:47,420 --> 02:09:48,440
And so it went.

1956
02:09:50,330 --> 02:09:55,330
An infantry man's days are numbered and
the law of attrition applied to the tune

1957
02:09:57,260 --> 02:09:58,550
as it always did.

1958
02:10:02,420 --> 02:10:07,420
In the summer of 1971 I flew out of
camera on Bay to return to my wife and

1959
02:10:08,391 --> 02:10:11,840
infant son.
I had just made captain.

1960
02:10:13,250 --> 02:10:18,250
It had been a long 12 months and I
had changed in more ways than rank.

1961
02:10:21,070 --> 02:10:21,903
Okay.

1962
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,680
At National Airport in Washington,

1963
02:10:23,681 --> 02:10:28,681
D c a pretty young woman stood waiting
in the terminal as I walked up the ramp

1964
02:10:30,910 --> 02:10:35,570
by her knee, just did a 15 old
child with curly blonde hair,

1965
02:10:35,571 --> 02:10:39,080
barely able to keep his balance
on his chubby little legs.

1966
02:10:40,130 --> 02:10:40,750
Okay.

1967
02:10:40,750 --> 02:10:45,220
I kissed them both. Hello.
The woman was happy.

1968
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:50,910
The boy was confused.
I was both.

1969
02:10:53,390 --> 02:10:54,680
I was also sad.

1970
02:10:56,440 --> 02:10:59,650
I mourn for the men I had left behind.

1971
02:11:01,290 --> 02:11:06,290
I grieved that their country would
never know what fine men they were.

1972
02:11:09,140 --> 02:11:11,240
I was proud to have served with them

1973
02:11:15,660 --> 02:11:19,100
and no doubt,
bye.

1974
02:11:19,101 --> 02:11:21,050
Absolutely feel the same way.

1975
02:11:22,340 --> 02:11:27,340
The amazing men and women who I saw

1976
02:11:29,940 --> 02:11:34,630
cut down
at the height of their lives

1977
02:11:38,390 --> 02:11:43,390
and our country will never really
know what fine people they were,

1978
02:11:45,381 --> 02:11:47,870
what fine human beings they were,

1979
02:11:52,360 --> 02:11:53,900
and I hope that from that,

1980
02:11:54,230 --> 02:11:59,230
from their sacrifice we can take and
we can learn from what they learned

1981
02:12:02,140 --> 02:12:07,140
or we can be inspired by them and driven
by them and become better leaders and

1982
02:12:07,361 --> 02:12:09,760
better people from their example.

1983
02:12:11,180 --> 02:12:16,130
Dan from the example of
men like Jim Mcdonald,

1984
02:12:17,260 --> 02:12:19,000
Hackworth and Bob Hoffman

1985
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:25,550
tanned, all those other,
those warriors and leaders

1986
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:30,670
that have taken point

1987
02:12:33,770 --> 02:12:35,030
and led the way.

1988
02:12:40,060 --> 02:12:41,020
And we

1989
02:12:43,280 --> 02:12:45,860
try to follow them down that path

1990
02:12:48,720 --> 02:12:51,240
as we remember those

1991
02:12:52,820 --> 02:12:54,710
who gave their lives

1992
02:12:58,360 --> 02:13:00,220
to clear that path for us.

1993
02:13:02,030 --> 02:13:05,180
Just so much to be taken away

1994
02:13:06,680 --> 02:13:08,900
from this experience.

1995
02:13:10,620 --> 02:13:11,453
And

1996
02:13:13,170 --> 02:13:15,870
it's almost like,
let's just read the whole book,

1997
02:13:18,840 --> 02:13:22,920
but there's so much more that I
didn't cover that I wanted to.

1998
02:13:23,610 --> 02:13:27,960
And you know, the fact of the matter is
you can get this book on Amazon. You Go,

1999
02:13:27,990 --> 02:13:32,100
you buy the book, you learn. That's
what you do. You don't have to

2000
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:35,380
live through this stuff to be able to
take away some of the lessons from it.

2001
02:13:37,020 --> 02:13:37,853
And

2002
02:13:38,690 --> 02:13:43,640
because that was such a, such a good book,
and there's so much information in it,

2003
02:13:43,700 --> 02:13:45,200
obviously I went long.

2004
02:13:46,190 --> 02:13:51,190
So we're going to hold off until
next time to do a little Q and.

2005
02:13:52,071 --> 02:13:52,904
A.

2006
02:13:54,200 --> 02:13:56,240
Uh,
but

2007
02:13:56,560 --> 02:14:00,550
if you do want to support the podcast,

2008
02:14:03,340 --> 02:14:07,120
there's a couple of ways you can do that.
Number one.

2009
02:14:08,050 --> 02:14:12,700
You can go to
the website Jocko,

2010
02:14:12,720 --> 02:14:17,530
store.com. You can click on the Amazon
link and you can buy this book right here.

2011
02:14:18,220 --> 02:14:19,720
The book is called platoon leader,

2012
02:14:19,750 --> 02:14:23,470
a memoir of command in combat
by James our mcdonough,

2013
02:14:24,580 --> 02:14:28,150
and you should do that.
You should do yourself that favor.

2014
02:14:29,290 --> 02:14:30,780
Yeah.
Also,

2015
02:14:31,030 --> 02:14:34,570
another way it could be simpler
is just go to the website Jocko,

2016
02:14:35,020 --> 02:14:39,130
podcast.com and go into the books section
where it list all of the books that

2017
02:14:39,131 --> 02:14:41,500
you cover. That'd be on there.
You just click on the book, boom.

2018
02:14:41,501 --> 02:14:45,610
It'll take you right to the, to
the Amazon link even easier. Yeah.

2019
02:14:45,611 --> 02:14:49,030
That way you don't have to
search if you're, you know,
if you're in a time crunch.

2020
02:14:49,480 --> 02:14:53,500
I like that. What else? What else
can we do to support the podcast?

2021
02:14:54,100 --> 02:14:56,710
Um, just if you're going to
buy anything from Amazon,

2022
02:14:56,860 --> 02:15:00,130
go to the Jacqueline store.com
or Jocko podcast.com.

2023
02:15:00,130 --> 02:15:02,650
Click on the Amazon link
before you do your shopping.

2024
02:15:02,651 --> 02:15:07,210
It'll take you to Amazon
just like you would have gone
anyway. And then, you know,

2025
02:15:07,320 --> 02:15:10,420
you do your shopping. There you go.
You can support that way passively.

2026
02:15:11,320 --> 02:15:16,150
And then I'm also on Jocko store if
you like, you know the shirts. We got

2027
02:15:17,710 --> 02:15:20,850
some coffee mugs on there, some
stickers, whatever. Um, you know,

2028
02:15:20,860 --> 02:15:24,910
I feel like you of that stuff,
just get some gets up.

2029
02:15:26,830 --> 02:15:27,490
And uh,

2030
02:15:27,490 --> 02:15:31,390
of course if you're in to supplements
or you're running low on supplements,

2031
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:36,370
go to or go back to on
it.com/jocko and uh,

2032
02:15:37,330 --> 02:15:40,000
and get some,
those are the good ones.

2033
02:15:40,530 --> 02:15:44,710
Pick up some krill oil for yourself.
Pick up some strong bone.

2034
02:15:45,700 --> 02:15:48,700
Pick up where your bars,
some warrior bars.

2035
02:15:48,701 --> 02:15:51,820
Somebody got a little low or just got a
little shit been a warrior bars in today

2036
02:15:51,821 --> 02:15:56,650
and I want to say thank you. It's just
a game. It's just, it saves the day.

2037
02:15:57,430 --> 02:16:00,620
It saves the day. Little snacky
snack. Someone asked, uh,

2038
02:16:01,870 --> 02:16:06,220
our warrior bars, uh, postworkout
or are they a meal replacement?

2039
02:16:06,221 --> 02:16:11,140
Like what are they? All the above. It's
all of that. And it's just a snack.

2040
02:16:11,680 --> 02:16:14,740
It's a snack but then eat too.
That's a little meal. Eat three.

2041
02:16:14,741 --> 02:16:18,940
That's like a full meal more or less.
Maybe with a salad or something,

2042
02:16:20,020 --> 02:16:21,850
but it's, yeah, it's, it's good.

2043
02:16:24,340 --> 02:16:25,210
As always,

2044
02:16:25,480 --> 02:16:30,480
if you want to kind
kick it with echo and I,

2045
02:16:31,270 --> 02:16:35,650
you can do that right on
the old inner webs. And I am

2046
02:16:37,180 --> 02:16:42,070
at Jocko Willink. Echo Charles is at
Echo Charles. That's on the Twitter.

2047
02:16:42,820 --> 02:16:47,310
That's on the Facebook. Uh,
that's also on the Instagram. Oh,

2048
02:16:47,440 --> 02:16:50,980
quick thing about the Instagram.
I just found this out not yesterday,

2049
02:16:50,981 --> 02:16:55,981
but the day before that there's a
like direct messages on Instagram.

2050
02:16:57,010 --> 02:16:58,120
You probably didn't even know that.

2051
02:16:59,240 --> 02:17:03,100
I did not know that because they have
it on Twitter and people send me direct

2052
02:17:03,101 --> 02:17:07,080
messages. Okay. So you can show me how to
check that. Well, yeah. Okay. So he was,

2053
02:17:07,090 --> 02:17:07,301
listen,

2054
02:17:07,301 --> 02:17:11,140
people sent me some messages and a lot
of people send me some and it's been,

2055
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:15,400
I've had Instagram for a long time. Yeah.
So there's a lot of men. I'm like, aw man,

2056
02:17:15,401 --> 02:17:19,810
I got to respond. But basically
if, if I don't respond,

2057
02:17:19,811 --> 02:17:23,410
it's not because I'm ignoring it,
it's cause straight up.

2058
02:17:23,411 --> 02:17:28,300
I didn't know what was going
on. You're supposed to be
the, the, the tech guy here.

2059
02:17:28,330 --> 02:17:32,890
Oh Man, I know. Dang. Yeah,
I'm learning that. Hey, look,
I learned. Right. You did good.

2060
02:17:32,891 --> 02:17:34,090
Did learn.
Uh,

2061
02:17:34,570 --> 02:17:39,570
with that you can join us there and you
can join us as we continue to try and

2062
02:17:42,171 --> 02:17:45,140
get a little bit better and
try and do a little bit better.

2063
02:17:45,590 --> 02:17:50,590
And we got examples of
leadership like mcdonough,

2064
02:17:51,350 --> 02:17:52,720
like the people that we talk about,

2065
02:17:54,270 --> 02:17:58,290
the people that I admire and the
people that I look to and say, yes,

2066
02:17:58,820 --> 02:18:00,800
that person stepped up and led.

2067
02:18:02,270 --> 02:18:07,270
That's the example that I try and follow
people that stepped up and led through

2068
02:18:10,820 --> 02:18:11,900
hard situations,

2069
02:18:11,901 --> 02:18:16,901
who dealt with the dichotomy of
leadership and yet dealt with the almost

2070
02:18:17,991 --> 02:18:21,770
unwinnable situations, dealt with rules
of engagement, dealt with challenges,

2071
02:18:21,771 --> 02:18:24,140
dealt with their own
platoon leader members,

2072
02:18:25,160 --> 02:18:27,260
threatening them to kill them,

2073
02:18:28,550 --> 02:18:30,530
dealt with all those things.

2074
02:18:32,180 --> 02:18:35,660
And yet they still lead.

2075
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:37,720
Yeah.

2076
02:18:37,720 --> 02:18:42,220
And so us, we got it easy. We got it easy.

2077
02:18:43,980 --> 02:18:46,140
So there's no excuse.

2078
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:51,360
None to stop any of us from getting up.

2079
02:18:52,060 --> 02:18:52,893
Okay.

2080
02:18:54,100 --> 02:18:55,090
Then getting after it.

2081
02:18:55,830 --> 02:18:56,663
Okay.

2082
02:18:57,720 --> 02:18:59,790
So until next time,

2083
02:19:01,620 --> 02:19:05,490
this is echo and Jocko
out.
