1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,270
To everybody listening.

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,960
People in uniform, people in
business suits, people in coveralls,

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:10,993
people,

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:12,943
everyone.

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,500
We talked today about Mikey Monsoor

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,320
and don't want to leave you with this.

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,640
Mikey monster was named
after Saint Michael.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,080
Saint Michael is the war your archangel
that led to heaven's army against Satan.

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,920
Yeah.

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,920
Saint Michael was known as the
principal of the angelic warriors

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,240
and was seen
as a protector against the darkness

12
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,140
and in the Christian religion,

13
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:59,000
specifically in the Anglican and the
Catholic and the Lutheran churches.

14
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,300
September 29th September 29th
is known as Michael Mass.

15
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,120
Yeah.

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,950
Or Saint Michael's Day.

17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,353
And that day,

18
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,960
September 29th,
2006

19
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:27,520
was the day that our Saint Michael,
Mikey Monsoor

20
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,110
was killed in Iraq.

21
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,840
The city of Ramadi sacrificing his life,

22
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:38,650
okay.

23
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,390
To save the lives of
three of his teammates,

24
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,170
three of his brothers,

25
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,380
three of his friends.

26
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,420
And I would ask you this,

27
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,240
when September 29th comes around,

28
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,140
okay.

29
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:04,973
Remember

30
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,950
I would ask that while you honor the hero
and you honor the warrior that Michael

31
00:02:16,191 --> 00:02:19,520
[inaudible] was,
please

32
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,270
also remember
that Mikey was a person,

33
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,950
keywords,
a smiling kid.

34
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,980
He was a jokester.

35
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,240
He was a determined man,

36
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,490
a brother, a son, or an uncle,

37
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,370
or a friend,

38
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,040
or Michael Monster.
War was a young man

39
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:02,690
with hopes and plans and
aspirations and dreams,

40
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,720
dreams for his future

41
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,780
and dreams for his life.

42
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,690
And in that moment of truth,

43
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,670
he gave them all,

44
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:34,830
all those hopes and all
those dreams he gave them all

45
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,693
to us.

46
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,610
Remember that.
